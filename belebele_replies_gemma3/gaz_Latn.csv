Ibsa armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee yaalii PALM sirriitti kan ibsu kami?,"Correct answer is **A: Akka qorannoon agarsiisutti faayidaan inni kennu kan dura yaadamee olitti dha**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""qorannooleen seera-qabeessi kan argisiisan, inni du’a ittisuuf amma yaadamee caalaa faayidaa gad-aanaa akka qabuudha."" This directly translates to ""research shows it has more benefit than previously thought in preventing death.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage states scientists are *using* ZMapp as a basis for comparison with three other treatments (PSLM), it doesn't say ZMapp is one of those treatments being compared.
*   **C:** The passage says ZMapp is used *as a basis* for the PSLM trial – a starting point for comparison. It is not *the* basis of the treatment itself.
*   **D:** The text focuses on a *change* in understanding ZMapp's effectiveness. It doesn't say it was always known to be promising. It now seems *more* promising based on new research.

Qorattoonni chiipsiin inni haaraan eessatti baay’ee jijjiirama fiduu akka danda’u yaadani?,"The correct answer is **A: Biyyoota galii gadi aanaa argatanitti** (In low-income countries).

Here's why:

The passage states the new chip is intended to help detect diseases like cancer, malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis *first* in developing countries and then potentially in more developed countries with increasing cancer rates. This indicates the biggest impact and initial focus of the technology is in countries with limited resources. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Biyyoota sooressootatti** (In developed countries) - The passage says it will *eventually* be used in developed countries, but that's not the primary focus.
*   **C: Yuunaayitid Isteeti keessatti** (In the United States) - While Stanford University is in the US, the passage focuses on global impact, not just the US.
*   **D: Yunivarsitii Istaanfoorditti** (At Stanford University) - Stanford developed the chip, but the goal is wider application than just within the university.



"
Meeshaa yaalaa hojjechuuf mala akkamii fayyadamu?,"The correct answer is **A: Saantimaa U.S tokko tokkoof**.

Here's why:

The passage states the device will use ""maxxansituu inkjeeti"" (presumably meaning an ink cartridge) and that ""maxxaansu kan tokkon tokko isaanii saantimaa U.S tokko ta’uu malaa"" (each cartridge will cost approximately $1 USD). This directly answers the question of *how* the device will function - by utilizing these affordable cartridges.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Maxxansituu inkijeeti istaandardii:** While the device *uses* ink cartridges, this doesn't explain *how* it functions or its cost.
* **C: Chiipsii maxxanfamuu danda’u:** The text doesn't mention chips.
* **D: Meeshaa yaalaa kanneen biroo:**  This is too vague and doesn't relate to the specific method described in the passage.

"Akka kutaa kanaatti, ibsi waa’ee loobeet iskaarpis sirrii hin taane kami?","The correct answer is **A: Taateen isaan uuman yeroo dhihootti uumamuu danda’a**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the loobeet iskaarpis *indicate* they were formed in a recent geological period (""taateewwan gi’oolojii kan isaan uuman kan dhiyoo akka ta’an agarsiisu""). This contradicts the idea that they could have formed a long time ago (""yeroo dhihootti uumamuu danda’a"").

Let's look at why the other options are *consistent* with the passage:

*   **B: Argama isaanii jechuun addeessi dalagaa ji’oloojikii dhaba jechuu miti** - The passage implies this by saying the presence of loobeet iskaarpis doesn't necessarily mean the earth is *not* moving geologically, challenging the idea that the earth is static.
*   **C: Sababa addeessi walitti galeef uumame ta’uu danda’a** - The passage states they are formed by pressure (""kan sababa ji’i suuta suutaan caccabduuf kan suuta uumamee dha"").
*   **D: Baay’een isaanii fuula addeessaa irratti kan argaman mitii** - The passage says they're found on all parts of the earth's surface (""Tuqaawwan qaama ji’aa hunduma irratti argamaan"").

Therefore, option A is the only statement that directly clashes with the information provided in the passage."
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, bifa lafaa ilaalchisee tiyoorii kamtu sochiin ji’ooloojii addeessa irratti uumamu akka jiru agarsiisaa?","The correct answer is **A: Addeessi suuta walitti galaa jiraachuu isaa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Saayintiistootni teessumaa lafa kan ji’aatti naannoftuu kan maqaanshee loobeet iskaarpis jedhamu argatan kan sababa ji’i suuta suutaan caccabduuf kan suuta uumamee dha."" This directly translates to scientists finding land formations (scarps) caused by repeated, minor shifts or movements.  This indicates that the surface (the crust) is undergoing continuous, though small, geological activity.
* **""Tuqaawwan qaama ji’aa hunduma irratti argamaan kan haala qilleensaa gadi bu’aan mul’atu, taateewwan gi’oolojii kan isaan uuman kan dhiyoo akka ta’an agarsiisu.""** This part highlights that features across the entire body of the land demonstrate a downward tilting, suggesting geological layers were formed over time with continued deformation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bifti lafaa yeroo dheeraa dura uumame:** While the passage does imply layers were formed *over time*, it emphasizes *ongoing* activity, not just past formation.
* **C: Fuula addeessaa irratti bifa lafaa xiqqaa qofatu jira:** The passage describes significant formations (scarps) and evidence of tilting, not just small features.
* **D: Bifti lafaa yeroo dhiyeenya kanatti uumame:** The passage contrasts this idea with the theory that the earth has no geological movement. The text argues *against* the earth being static.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, hanga himannaan dhiyaattutti maaltu heddumminaan hin jiraatu?","Correct answer: **B: Maxxansa suuraa**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...garuu suuraan ishii bal’inaan waan maxxanfamee jiruuf ragaan ijaan arge kam iyyuu faalamuu mala."" This translates to ""...but because her picture has been widely published, no eyewitness testimony can be reported."" This means the wide publication of her photo is hindering the ability to use eyewitness accounts. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yaadota dabalataa (Additional thoughts)** - The passage doesn't mention a lack of additional thoughts.
*   **C: Marii ragoota ijaan arganii (Eyewitness testimony)** - The passage states eyewitness testimony *can't* be reported *because* of the photo publication, so it isn't the thing that's lacking in general.
*   **D: Maxxansa barruulee (Publication of writings)** - The passage focuses on the *suuraa* (photo) publication, not writings.

"Akka kutaa kanaatti, yeroo ammaatti adamsitoota siiliitif rakkoon maali dha?","Correct answer: **A: Haala qilleensaa baay’ee hamaa ta’e**

**Explanation:**

The text states that ""haalonni qilleensaa hamoon tattaaffiiwwan lubbuu baraaruu danqanii jiru"" (severe weather conditions are causing life-threatening situations). This directly indicates that the current problem for the silkworm farmers is the severe weather conditions. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hanga cabbii** - While cabbii (locusts) are mentioned, they are a *result* of the weather, not the primary problem.
*   **C: Furdinni cabbii** - The control of locusts is also a consequence, not the initial issue.
*   **D: Baqiinsa cabbii** - The locust invasion is a symptom, not the root cause.



"
"Haala cabbiitti dabalata, maaltu lubbu baraartota irratti dhiibbaa fida?","Correct answer: **B: Haala qilleensaa**

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly states: ""haaloonni qilleensaa hamoon tattaaffiiwwan lubbuu baraaruu danqanii jiru"" which translates to ""climate conditions are worsening and affecting livelihoods."" This directly links climate conditions to the difficulties faced by those who depend on cabbii.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hnqina dhiyeessii:** (Supply issues) - This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Gargaarsa dhabuu:** (Lack of assistance) - This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Adamsitoota siilii:** (Seed dealers) - While the text mentions a decline in cabbii sales to seed dealers, it doesn't say this *causes* problems for those who depend on cabbii, only that it's a symptom of a broader issue.



"
Rooberti ilaalcha kamiin mirkaneessuu irraa of qusate?,"The correct answer is **A: Dhimmoota naamusaa irratti mari’achuu (Discussing moral issues)**.

Here's why:

The passage states Roobertis initially refused to be questioned (""yeroo itti jireenya jalqabee yeroo gafaatamee dubbachuu dide""). He then invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination (""seera yeroo gaafatamee, akkas jechuudhan seeran alaa ta’uu danda’aa yaada kennun"").  This relates to avoiding situations where he would be forced to discuss potentially incriminating or *morally compromising* information about himself.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bulchiinsa Mana Murtii Olaanaa barbaachisaa itti fufiinsaa qabaachuu (Needing to abide by the Supreme Court's rulings):** While he eventually referenced a Supreme Court case (Ree'o v. Weediin), his initial resistance wasn't about avoiding adherence to the Supreme Court. It was about protecting himself.
* **C: Bakka itti jireenyi eegalu (Where his residency is):** The passage doesn't mention anything about residency.
* **D: Mirga iccitii qabaachuu (Having the right to testify):** He *exercised* his right *against* self-incrimination. He didn't refuse to testify because he didn’t *have* the right, but because he wanted to *avoid* using it.



"
Mata duree Rooberti irratti mari’achuun naamusa dhabuudha jedhee itti dhaga’amu isa kami?,"The correct answer is **B: Murtoo Roe v. Wade**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Inni garuu, jeecha isaa isa jalqabaa irra deebi'ee Ree'o v. Weediin """"seera dachechaa kan furmaata argate"""" jechuun irra deebi’e..."" This directly connects the discussion about Robertis's stance to the *Roe v. Wade* ruling. The passage frames his initial opposition to speaking on the matter as a rejection of a legal precedent established by *Roe v. Wade*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bulchiinsi Mana Murtii Olaanaa Itti fufiinsa qabaachuu:** While the Supreme Court's authority is relevant to *Roe v. Wade*, the passage doesn't focus on the general principle of Supreme Court precedent. It specifically centers on the *Roe v. Wade* case itself.
* **C: Mirga Iccitii ifatti baasuu:**  The passage mentions the right to privacy, but it's presented as something Robertis affirmed *based on* the *Roe v. Wade* decision, not as the direct source of the controversy surrounding his silence.
* **D: Dhimmoota addaa:** This is too broad. While the issue is certainly a contentious one, the passage's core focus is the specific legal precedent of *Roe v. Wade* and Robertis's relationship to it.



"
Xiyyi ifaa lamaan eessatti calaqqisa?,"The correct answer is **A: Gara samiitti** (Towards the sky).

The text states ""Xiyyaan ifaa lama halkan tokkoon gara iddoo samii kessatti diriiraniiru"" which directly translates to ""Two bright lights were directed towards the sky with one force."" This clearly indicates they were aimed upwards, towards the sky.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Magaalittii guutuutti** (Throughout the city) - The text doesn't mention the lights being spread throughout the city.
* **C: Xiyeeffachuun Jeettii jalqabaatti** (By illuminating the first plane) - While the context implies the event is related to 9/11, the text doesn't say the lights illuminated the first plane.
* **D: Giddu galeessa paarkii yaadannootti** (In the middle of the memorial park) - The memorial park is mentioned as a separate location, not where the lights were directed.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, gamooleen samii tuqan yoom bakka sanatti ijaaraman?","The correct answer is **C: Halkan tokkotti**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Xiyyaan ifaa lama halkan tokkoon gara iddoo samii kessatti diriiraniiru."" which translates to ""Two beams of light were projected into the sky at one o'clock."" This directly answers the question of *when* the memorial beams were lit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: walakkeessa guyyaa** (every day) - The text doesn't mention if it happens every day.
*   **B: Sa’atii 8:46 a.m. tti** (at 8:46 a.m.) - This is the time of the initial event being commemorated, not when the beams are lit.
*   **D: Ijaarsichi itti fufaa jira** (The construction is ongoing) - This refers to the construction of the memorial, not the timing of the beams.



"
Odeeffannoo kamtu Obboleettonni Torban Holqa ta’uu yaada kenna?,"The correct answer is **A: Garaagarummaa Teempireecharaa**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ""obbooleettiiwan torban"" (the ten objects) are thought to be volcanoes because infrared images show a difference in temperature between the day and night, indicating they are warmer during the day and cooler at night – a characteristic of volcanoes.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Diyaameetira seensa holqichaa (Diameter of the volcanic cone):** While the passage *mentions* the diameter, it doesn't suggest this is *why* they are thought to be volcanoes. It's just a descriptive characteristic.
* **C: Qorannoo Ji’ooloojikaal (Geological research):**  While a geologist (Gileen Kuushiingi) is mentioned, the research itself isn't presented as the primary evidence for the volcanic nature.
* **D: Suuraa Holqawwan lafa irraa (Images of volcanoes from the ground):** The passage references *infrared* images, not ground-based images, and it's the temperature difference revealed in those images that’s key.



"
Amalli ho’iinsa Obboloota Torbaa akkamiin ilaalame?,"The correct answer is **A: Suuraa infiraareedii (Infrared imagery)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Suuraan infiraareedii akka agarsiisutti garaagarummaan teempireechara guyyaa fi halkanii akka holqaa ta’uu agarsiisa."" (According to infrared imagery, it shows the difference in temperature between day and night as hollows.) This directly links the observation of the hollows' temperature differences to infrared imagery.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Boolla gadi fagoo lafa keessaa (Deep pits in the ground):** While the passage *describes* the hollows as resembling these, it's not *how* their temperature difference was *observed*.
*   **C: Diyaameetira holqichaa (Diameter of the hollows):** The diameter is a measurement, not a method of observation.
*   **D: Qorannoo holqawwan lafa irraa (Research on hollows on the ground):** This is too general; the passage specifies *how* the hollows are studied (infrared imagery).



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, ibsi waa’ee shakkiichaa sirrii hin taanee kami?","The correct answer is **C: Saba eessaa akka ta’e aangawootaan beekameera**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Maqaan isaa amma iyyuu aangawoota jalaa dhokataadha, miseensa qomoo Uighur ta’uu isaa yooma beekanillee.""  This translates to ""His name is still hidden from the authorities, even though they know he is a member of the Uighur ethnic group.""

This *contradicts* the statement that the authorities know his ethnicity. The passage explicitly says they *do* know, despite trying to conceal his identity.

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with the text:

*   **A: Yeroo haleellaa konkolaataa fayyadame** (The time the vehicle was used) - The passage doesn't provide information about *when* the vehicle was used, so a statement about it being incorrect isn't refuted.
*   **B: Meeshaa dhohu hidhatee dhoose** (The explosive device was hidden) - The passage starts with ""Namtichi meeshaa dhoohu hidhatee jedhame himamu..."" which means ""The man is accused of hiding an explosive device..."" So, this is consistent.
*   **D: Miidhaan irra hin geenye** (He had no injuries) - The passage states he was arrested ""booda to’atameera"" which implies he was unharmed.



"
Waa’ee haleellichaan wal qabatee aanga’oonni odeeffannoo maalii mirkaneessani?,"The correct answer is **B: Sabummaa nama shakkamee** (The ethnicity of the suspect).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that even though his name is being withheld from authorities, it *is* known that the suspect is a member of the Uighur ethnic group. This is the key piece of information the authorities have revealed about the suspect in connection with the incident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Eenyummaa nama isa waliin hojjetu kamiyyuu** (The identity of anyone he worked with) - The passage doesn't mention anyone he worked with.
*   **C: Kaka’umsa haleellaa kana dugda duuba jiru** (The underlying motive for the attack) - While the passage mentions a message claiming responsibility, the actual motive isn't explicitly confirmed.
*   **D: Maqaa fi maqaa abbaa shakkamaa** (The name and father's name of the suspect) - The passage specifically states his name is being withheld.



"
Garee kamtu tapha Paarkii Ellistti godhamu irratti taphata?,"The correct answer is **C: Afriikaa Kibbaa fi Awustiraaliyaa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...taphni dhumaa dorgommii walitti aanaa kan inni geggeffamuu Elis Paark Johanisbargitidha turban dhufuu, gaafa Springboks Awustiraaliya wajjin taphatu."" 

* ""Springboks"" is the nickname for the South African national rugby team.
* Therefore, the final match at Ellis Park will be between South Africa (Springboks) and Australia.



"
Ispiringibuuksii tapha isaanii itti aanu eessatti taphatu?,"The correct answer is **C: Johanisbargi**.

The passage states: ""Taphni dhumaa dorgommii walitti aanaa kan inni geggeffamuu Elis Paark Johanisbargitidha turban dhufuu, gaafa Springboks Awustiraaliya wajjin taphatu."" (The final match of the series will be played at Ellis Park, Johannesburg, when the Springboks play Australia.)

Therefore, the Inspiringbooks will next play in Johannesburg.



"
Buufatni hawaa yeroo ergamaa kanneen armaan gadii keessaa isa kam irratti rakkoon isa mudate?,"Correct answer: **B: Jiirooskooppii eeggachuu**

Here's why:

The passage states the balloon *lost its position due to a problem with the gyroscope* (""jiirooskooppii dursa ergama buufataa hawaa irratti dhabu iyyuu bakka isaa tursiiseera"").  The other options are things that were *observed* or *resulted* from the problem, but not the root cause of the problem itself.

*   **A:**  Distance from the correctors is a result of the problem, not the problem itself.
*   **C:**  Confirming the landing site is a later event.
*   **D:**  Getting the correct altitude is also a result of the problem being corrected."
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, kaayyoon ergama buufata hawaa maali?","Lakkoofsa barbaachisaa argachuuf, kan isa godhe ergama buufataa hawaa jiirooskooppii bade argachuufi. Kanaafuu, deebiin sirriin **A: Jiirooskooppii bade argachuu** dha."
Himoota armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee dhimmichaa irratti dhugaa kan hin taane kami?,"Correct answer is **A: Naannoo waajjira muummee AOL qabu keessatti himatame**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the case took place in a Virginia court**, not near AOL's headquarters.  It doesn't mention anything about the location being related to AOL's offices.

Let's look at why the other options *are* true based on the text:

* **B: Murtiin murtaa’eera (A verdict was reached):** The passage says the case *was* brought to court and a ruling was made based on the 2003 law.
* **C: Dhimma kana keessatti seera Ispam imeelii ilaalchisee bahe fayyadameera (The spam email law was used in this case):** The passage explicitly states the case involved violating the 2003 law against unwanted email (spam).
* **D: AOL himatameera (AOL was sued):** The passage clearly states AOL, a well-known internet service provider, was the plaintiff (the one doing the suing).

"Akka kutaa kanaatti, Viidaal bara dorgommii sadii dura kilabii kamiif taphachuu jalqabe?","Correct answer is **C: Baarsaa**.

Here's why:

The text states Vidal joined Barcelona (Baarsaa) three years ago. It also says he played 49 games for the club. Therefore, he started playing for Barcelona three years ago."
Vidal Baarsaaf tapha meeqa taphate?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The text explicitly states: ""Viidaal kilaabii isaaf taphaa 49 taasisee"" which translates to ""Vidal played 49 games for the club.""
"
Tapha kana irratti gareen morkataa eenyufa dha?,"The correct answer is **B: Boloni’a**.

The text states the match is *with* Bologna (""tapha Dilbataaf karoorfame kan Boloonyaa wajjinii""). Therefore, Bologna is the opposing team.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jaarkuye:** This refers to Jarque Kooverchiyaanoo, the player who was staying at the hotel, not the opposing team.
*   **C: Koverkiano:** This is the player's name, not the team he's playing against.
*   **D: Itaali:** Italy is the country, not the specific team.



"
Jaarkuye maaliif hoteela keessa ture?,"Correct answer: **C: Gaafa dilbataa tapha qaba ture**

Here's why:

The text states ""Hooteela gartichaa keessa ture tapha Dilbataaf karoorfame kan Boloonyaa wajjinii dursee."" This directly translates to ""He was in the hotel before the game scheduled for Saturday with Bologna."" This means he was there *because* of the game on Saturday.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shaakala qaba ture** - While he was injured, the text doesn't say this is *why* he was at the hotel.
*   **B: Walgahii bara dorgommii duraa qaba ture** - The text doesn't mention any pre-season meetings.
*   **D: Bolonia waliin shaakala irra ture** - He was facing Bologna in a game, but the text doesn’t indicate this is why he was at the hotel."
Maaliif eejansiin ji’oofiiziksii Jaakartaa akeekkachiisa hin kennine?,"The correct answer is **D: Ulaagaa hanga kirkira uumuu danda’uu hin guutu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...akka eejansii ji'oofiiziksii Jaakartaatti immoo, akeekkachiisi suunaamii kennamu hin jiru, **sababni isaas kirkirri sun haal-duree barbaadamu guddina 6.5 hin guutne.**""  This translates to: ""...but the geophysics agency in Jakarta did not issue a tsunami warning, **because the earthquake did not meet the required magnitude of 6.5.**""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Balaan suunaami hin jiru ture** (There was no tsunami force) - While true in the end, this is a *result* of the magnitude being insufficient, not the *reason* the warning wasn't issued.
*   **B: Jiraattota naannoo gidduu rifuu hambisuuf** (To prevent panic among local residents) - The passage mentions people starting to panic *after* the lack of warning, not as a reason *for* it.
*   **C: Dhiibbaa inni daldaloota giddu galeessaa irratti fidu hambisuuf** (To reduce its impact on intermediate traders) - This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, kirkirri maal fida?","The correct answer is **A: Jiraattota naannoo rifachiisuu** (Displacing people in the area).

Here's why:

The passage states the earthquake is *not* strong enough (magnitude 6.5) to trigger a tsunami warning. However, it *does* cause people to become anxious, start evacuating, and sell/abandon their homes. This means the earthquake is *displacing* people, causing them to leave the area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Balaa suunaamii** (Tsunami disaster) - The passage explicitly states there is no tsunami.
*   **C: Akeekkachiisa kennuu** (Giving a warning) -  A warning wasn't issued *because* the earthquake wasn't strong enough.
*   **D: Iskeeliidhaan hanga 6.5 ta’uu danda’a** (Can be up to 6.5 on the Richter scale) - This is a statement about the earthquake’s potential strength, not what it *does*.



"
Isaan keessaa isa kamtu sochii Aduu fi urjiilee biroo hunda kakaasa?,"The correct answer is **A: Liyuminisitii fi yaa’aa pilaazmaa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Liyuminisitii fi naanna’uu wal faana gargaaramuun lakkoofsa urjii Roosbii murteessuuf oolu, kun yaa’a pilaazmaa waliin wal qabatu."" This directly links luminosity and plasma yaks (yaa’aa pilaazmaa) to driving the energy calculations and therefore the overall process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lakkoobsa Roosii, akkaataa naanna’uu, fi duubatti-deebisa maagineetii:** These are *results* or factors *affected by* the core process, not the drivers of it. The passage says luminosity and plasma interactions *determine* the Rossby number, they don't *cause* the entire process.
* **C: Naanna’uu fi liyuminisitii:** While luminosity is a key driver, naannaa'uu (brightness) is a characteristic related to it, but not the fundamental driving force on its own.
* **D: Liyuminisitii, Lakkoobsa Roosbii, fi naanna’uu:**  The Rossby number is a consequence, not a cause.



"
Akkamiin lakkoobsi urjii Roosbii adda ba’a?,"The correct answer is **A: Liyuminisitii fi naanna’uu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Liyuminisitii fi naanna’uu wal faana gargaaramuun lakkoofsa urjii Roosbii murteessuuf oolu..."" (Luminosity and clarity are used together to determine the energy number of the Rossi,...) 

The other options are mentioned in the passage, but are *affected* by the Rossi number, or work *with* it, rather than being how it is *determined*.
*   **B: Hanga pilaazmaa yaa’u** - related to the Rossi number but doesn't *define* it.
*   **C: Sadarkaa dalagaa** - not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Hanga duubatti deebisa maagneetii** - affects the Rossi number when small, but isn't how it's initially calculated.



"
Namoota dhibbentaa meeqatu Awustiraaliyaan battalatti riippaablika akka taatu deeggara akka qoratametti?,"The correct answer is **B: dhibbentaa 29**.

The text states: ""warraa sagalee kennan keessa parsaantiin 29 kan ta’aan Awuustiraliyaan riipabliika ta’uu qabdi safiisa barbaadameen jedhuu"" which translates to ""29 percent of voters believe Australia should become a republic."" 

Therefore, 29% of voters support Australia becoming a republic."
"Akka Juuliyaa Gilaarditti, Awustiraaliyaan yoom riippaablika taati?","The correct answer is **B: Bulchiisa Giiftii Eelsaabex II booda**.

This directly translates to ""Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 election campaign that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.""



"
Dhaabbata kamtu qorannoo seeraa jala jira?,"The correct answer is **A: Haawus Enerjii fi Koomersi Koomiitee**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...isa gaaddisa Haawus Enerjii fi Koomersi Koomitii jala ooluutti qorataa jira."" This translates to ""...is investigating under the authority of the Hawus Energy and Commerce Committee."" This clearly indicates that Haawus Enerjii fi Koomersi Koomiitee is involved in the legal proceedings/research.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dhaabbata Koomeen:** The text states Dhaabbata Koomeen issued a directive, but doesn't say it *is* undergoing legal research.
*   **C: Warrummaa Karoorfame:** This refers to a planned inheritance/trust, and is the subject of the investigation, not an entity undergoing research.
*   **D: Koree Cita To’annoo fi Qorannoo:** While mentioned, it's described as conducting investigations *related to* Warrummaa Karoorfame, not as an entity undergoing research itself.



"
Kiliif Stiirnis geggeessaa koree kamii dha?,"The correct answer is **A: Haawus Enerjii fi Koomersi Koomiitee**.

The text states: ""Istiirns gibirri karaa Warrummaa Karoorfamee deeggarsa ulfa baasuutiif oolaa jiraachuu fi dhiisuu isaa akka dura-ta’aa To’annaa fi Qorannaawwan Koree-gadaanaa, **isa gaaddisa Haawus Enerjii fi Koomersi Koomitii** jala ooluutti qorataa jira.""  This directly links Kiliif Stiirnis to leading within the Haawus Enerjii fi Koomersi Koomiitee.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, dubartii Iswiiz irratti maaltu hin raawwanne?","Correct answer: **A: Meesholeen ishee hataman deebifamaniiru**

**Explanation:**

The text states: “Nuti namoota dubartii Iswiiz gudeedan shan to’annoo jala kan oolchinee fi bilbilaa fi laaptooppii ishee deebisneeraafi.” This translates to ""We have arrested five suspects in connection with the robbery of a Swiss woman and returned her mobile phone and laptop.""

This clearly indicates that items stolen *from* the woman were recovered, not that harm was done *to* her directly.  The text doesn't mention she was killed (B), sexually assaulted (C), or simply had her belongings stolen without recovery (D). Therefore, the fact that her stolen items were returned is the action *not* taken against her.
"
Dhaabbata kamtu Badhaasa Taa’iwaan Itti fufiinsaa bara 2007 badhaafame?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The text explicitly states: ""...badhaasa yeroo hundaa itti gaafatamaa Yuwan Riipablikaa Chaayinaa **ASUS** kan 2007 Taayiwaan keessatti badhaasa."" ( ...permanently responsible for the 2007 Taiwan ASUS award in the Republic of China.)

Therefore, ASUS was the company awarded at the 2007 Taiwan award ceremony."

Sanada poostaa badeef itti gaafatamummaa kan fudhatu eenyu?,"The correct answer is **A: Hojjettoota mana poostaa** (Postal workers).

Here's why:

The text states the post office sent out cards and that the incident involved the post office losing/misplacing over 600 New Year's cards. Therefore, the postal workers are the ones responsible for the error.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jiraattota gartuu Obanazawa** (Residents of Obanazawa): They are the *recipients* of the cards, not responsible for the error.
* **C: Mucicha** (The postman): While the postman is a postal worker, the issue was with the office losing cards, not just one postman's delivery.
* **D: Miidiyaa** (The media): The media reported on the issue, but they aren't responsible for it.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, waa’ee sanada badeef eenyutu dhiifama gaafate?","The correct answer is **C: Miidiyaa**.

The text states: ""...lammiilee fi **miidiyaa** dhiifama gaafateera."" (…the people and **the media** apologized.)

Therefore, the media asked for forgiveness regarding the incident."
Del Potro dhimma gatiittii isaa yoom furmaata itti kennuu qaba ture?,"Correct Answer: **C: Yeroo teessuma lammaffaa**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Del Porto n carraa duraa kan qabu tuuta isa lamaffaa keessati ture..."" which translates to ""Del Porto had the first chance in the second set...""  This means Del Potro's opportunity to resolve the tiebreak was during the *second* set."
Sababiin cituu saqii jalqabaa maal ture?,"The correct answer is **A: Maaraayiin teessuma isaa jalqabaan injifatame**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Maaraayiin teessuma isaa jalqaba dhabee sababa ergaa dhiirotni lamaan wal qixxaataniif kan teessumaa waliin qoodataanin booda."" This translates to ""Maaraayiin lost his first set because after the two strong players competed and shared the set, he lost it."" 

Therefore, the reason for losing the first set was that Maaraayiin was defeated in his first set."
"Akka kutaa kanaatti eerametti, addatti eenyutu dhukkubsattootatti saaxila ba’e?","The correct answer is **A: Bulchaa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: “Har’a, Daa’imman umriin isaani kan barnootaaf ga’e akka nama dhibeen qabame waliin tuttuqqii qaban addaan bahan barree jirra.” This translates to ""Today, I am signing legislation to ensure children of school age are not treated as if they have a disease.""

This indicates the ""Bulchaa"" (Governor) is the one taking action to separate children from those who are sick/considered as having a disease. Therefore, they are the one addressing the situation regarding the sick."
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, bulchaan kun yeroo lammiilee Teeksaasiif haasaa godhu mirkaneessa akkamii hin kennine?","The correct answer is **A: Sirnichi sirnaan akka dalagaa jiru**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the governor said, ""I want to assure you that our system is working as it should.""** This directly translates to ""Sirnichi sirnaan akka dalagaa jiru"" - that the system is functioning properly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Haalonni nageenya hawwaasaa eeguuf dalagamaa akka jiran:** While the governor mentions safety, the passage focuses on the system *working*, not specifically the *measures* in place for safety.
* **C: Rakkoo kana dandamachuuf hidhatanii jiru:** The passage doesn't state they are prepared to handle the problem, only that the system is functioning.
* **D: Dhimmichi kan nama yaaddessu miti:** The passage actually portrays the situation as serious (""Dhimmi kun cimaadha"" - ""This is a serious matter"").



"
Maddi oduu nama bohaarsuu barattoota UW duraanii lamaan kalaqame kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Agarsiisa Guyyaa guyyaa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yeroo hedduu dura osoo Agarsiisa-Guyyaa guyaa fi Gabaasni Kolbert hin dhiyaatin, Heeki fi Joonsan maxxansa oduu ba’eessa godhuu-fi gabaasa oduu mul’ata godhatanii turani..."" This directly indicates that *Agarsiisa Guyyaa guyyaa* (a daily show) and Colbert Report didn't exist *before* Heeki and Joonsan started their news venture. Therefore, the news venture is what the question is referring to.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gabaasa Kolbert:** The passage states this *didn't* exist at the time.
*   **B: Kolleejjii Ellekitooraalii:** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Qullubbii adii:** This is a detail *about* the news venture, not the venture itself.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa impaayera oduu bohartii Qullubbii adii keessatti kan hin dabalamne?","The correct answer is **B: Fiilmii**.

Here's why:

The passage lists several elements associated with the Qullubbi Adiin empire's news coverage:

*   A news broadcast (Heeki & Joonsan)
*   A 5,000,000 circulation magazine
*   Personal interviews
*   A 24-hour network podcast
*   The *Aawur Daambi Woorildi* world atlas

It does *not* mention films (fiilmii) as being part of their operation. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Atilaasii addunyaa** - Specifically mentioned as part of the coverage.
*   **C: Marsariitii** - Explicitly stated as having a circulation of 5,000,000.
*   **D: Maxxansa waraqaa** - The magazine is a form of printed publication (maxxansa waraqaa).



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, poolisiidhaan kan eegamaa ture maali?","The correct answer is **C: Seensa daandii Dawoninig**.

The passage states: ""Mormichi kan eegalee naannoo sa’aatii 11:00 ti (UTC+1) fallaa galmaa adii Poolisiin eega turee seensa karaa Dawoninig, mana jireenya Muummee ministeera isaa sirrii."" This directly translates to ""The protest started around 11:00 am (UTC+1) at the entrance to Downing Street, near the Prime Minister's residence.""

Therefore, the police were monitoring the entrance to Downing Street.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Marfata Trafalgar:** This is a location the protesters *passed through*, not where the police were initially focused.
*   **B: Foramii Arfaasaa:** This is not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Hoteela Giraand Konnaawot Roomsi:** This is the final destination of the protest, not where the police were initially observing."
Poolisiin sa'aatii meeqatti mormitoonni cinqii sochii akka hin uumneef akka isaan bakkaa socho'an gaafatee?,"The correct answer is **D: 11:20 tti**.

The text states: ""11:20 irratti poolisiin hiriirtotni akka dubatti deebi’an gaafate, haala sochii tiraafikaa walirra tuulamuufi mirga hiriiruusaanii waliin madalchiisuun akka irraa eegamu itti himuudhaan."" This translates to ""At 11:20, the police asked the protestors to return to their starting point, telling them to avoid disrupting traffic and respecting their right to protest."" Therefore, the police asked the protestors to move at 11:20.



"
Qorannoo Dr. Ihudi Urin taasifame keessatti kamtu dhugaa dha?,"The correct answer is **B: Hantuuti qorannoo kan duraani dhukkuba sukkaaraa qabani amma dhukkuba sukkaaraan hin qabani**

Here's why:

The text directly states: “Amma nuyi hantuuta ji’a afurii kan dhukkuba sukkaaraa hin qabne kan duraan qaban turan qabna,” which translates to ""Now we have five-year-olds who don't have diabetes who used to have it.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text doesn't say the results *will* be beneficial for anyone, just that the research is in its early stages and needs further investigation. It also specifically mentions it may not benefit those with type 1 diabetes.
*   **C:** The text doesn't express optimism about a cure, but rather a very early stage of research. Dr. Ur doesn't believe diabetes can be cured, according to the text.
*   **D:** The text focuses on people *no longer* having diabetes, not people who *currently* are developing it.



"
"Akkaataa ibsa kanaatti, shakkiin Dr. Ur maali?","The correct answer is **D: Yoo hantuutonni qorannoo dhukkuba sukkaara hin qabne akkuma sanaan turan**.

Here's why:

The passage states Dr. Ur is concerned the research is in its ""early days"" and warns that, ""like those before him, he does not believe a cure for diabetes is possible."" He also points out the finding isn't helpful for those with type 1 diabetes. This all suggests his concern is whether the initial positive results (people previously with diabetes no longer having it) will hold up and that it may not be a widely applicable solution. Essentially, he doubts if the people studied are truly representative and if the results can be generalized.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't say he doubts the importance of the research for those with type 1 diabetes, but rather that the findings *aren't helpful* for them.
*   **B:** The passage doesn't mention anything about a vaccine being possible.
*   **C:** The passage focuses on his personal skepticism, not what other experts think.



"
Ibsa armaan gadii keessaa sirriitti caccabuu balaliinsa CG4684 kan hin ibsine isa kami?,"Correct answer is **C: Xiyyaarichi osoo hin lafa hin caccabin dura yeroo sadii lafa qubachuuf yaale**.

Here's why:

The text states the plane *attempted* to land twice, but only the second attempt is mentioned in detail (10 minutes before it went down). It doesn't say it attempted a third time *before* crashing.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

*   **A:** ""Barbaachichi sababuma qilleensa badaa qubannaa sana dhorkeen addaan cite."" - This directly states the weather hindered the landing.
*   **B:** ""Bakki itti caccabe har’a argame; salphaatti immoo bira ga’amuun waan hindanda’amneef..."" - This means the crash site is remote and hard to reach.
*   **D:** ""Bakka itti xiyyaarichi caccabe argachuun sababa haala qilleensaan rakkiseera"" - This directly states the weather made finding the crash site difficult.



"
Balallii CG4684 lafa qubachuu isaa akka dhiisu kan taasise maali?,"The correct answer is **A: Bakki qubatu sirriitti hin argamu** (The crash site wasn't found).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""garuu aal tokko duraan qubachuu dhiisee ture."" which translates to ""but one attempt to crash had been aborted beforehand."" And later, ""Bakki itti caccabe har’a argame; salphaatti immoo bira ga’amuun waan hindanda’amneef poolisoonni lama bakkicha miillaan akka deemanii namoota lubbuun hafa akka barbaadaniif daggala keessa buufaman."" meaning ""The wreckage was found today; since it's difficult to reach by other means, two policemen are walking to the site to search for survivors.""

This implies the initial attempt to crash *failed* because the intended crash site wasn't properly reached or found at the time. The search efforts confirm this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Xiyyaaronni biroo hedduun xiyyaara CG4684 ni dursu** (Many planes preceded plane CG4684) - The passage doesn't mention other planes.
* **C: Xiyyaarichi gara Kokodatti kallattii isaa jijjiireeti** (The plane changed its course to Kokoda) - The passage states the plane was *trying* to reach Kokoda, not that it diverted from it.
* **D: Haalli qilleensaa mijataa miti** (The weather conditions weren't favorable) - While bad weather is mentioned as making the search difficult, it doesn't explain why the initial crash attempt was aborted.



"
"Ibsa kana bu’uureffachuun, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee muuxannoo Firansiiszeek Koowal kamtu dhugaa dha?","The correct answer is **D: Foddaa cabsuuf yeroo yaalutti miidhaan irra ga’eera.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Fulleen foddaa tokko dhuma irratti cabnaan, karaa foddaa ba’uu eegalan,” which translates to ""After finally drinking the contents of one bottle, he began to find a way out."" This implies he was *trying* to drink the bottles (to escape or for some other reason) and it was *after* drinking that he succeeded. This aligns with option D – experiencing hardship (miidhaan irra ga’eera) *while trying* to drink the bottles (foddaa cabsuuf yeroo yaalutti).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Foddaa cabsuu danda’eera** - While he *did* drink a bottle, the text doesn't simply state he *could* drink them, but that it happened after a struggle.
*   **B: Miidhaan isa irra hin geenye** - The text implies hardship and a struggle *before* he managed to drink the bottle, so this is incorrect.
*   **C: Bakkee ba’uuf yeroo yaalutti teessuma cabseera** - The text doesn't specifically say he was trying to escape *while* drinking, only that drinking led to him finding a way out.



"
Maaliif dhiibbaa Obomboleettii Tiroopikaalii Daani’eel safaruun rakkoo ta’e?,"The correct answer is **C: Obomboleettiin sosocho’iinsa lafaa irraa fagoo dha** (The tropical storm is far from land).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Obomboleettiin sosocho’iinsa lafaa irraa fagoodha, Yuunayitid Iisteetsii fi Kaaribiyaanii irratti dhiibbaa cimaa inni qabu qorachuun rakkisaa ta’ee hafeera."" This directly translates to ""The storm being far from land makes it difficult to assess its significant impact on the United States and the Caribbean.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Obomboleettiin kun cimee gara haarikeeniitti guddate** (The storm is intensifying into a hurricane) - While the passage mentions it *may* become a hurricane, this isn't the reason for the difficulty in assessing its impact.
*   **B: Saayintistoonni waa’ee qilleensa obomboleettii kanaa itti fufiinsa qabaachuun isaa kan mirkanaa’e miti** (Scientists are not sure about the storm’s trajectory) - This isn't mentioned as a problem in the passage.
*   **D: Obomboleettiin kun Miyaamii irraa fagootti argama** (The storm is far from Miami) - While true, the distance from Miami isn't the *reason* it's hard to assess the impact – it's the distance from *land* generally.



"
"Akkaataa Ibsa kanaatti, waa’ee Obomboleettii Tiroopikaalii Daani’eel dhugaa kan hin taane kami?","The correct answer is **A: Dhiibbaa inni biyyoota Kaariibiyaaniitti fidu beekamaa miti** (Its impact on Caribbean countries is not known).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Obonboleettichi... Yuunayitid Iisteetsii fi Kaaribiyaanii irratti dhiibbaa cimaa inni qabu qorachuun rakkisaa ta’ee hafeera."" (The storm... makes it difficult to assess its significant impact on the United States and the Caribbean.) This *directly* contradicts option A, as it acknowledges there *is* a potential impact, even if hard to assess.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **B: Garba Atilaantikiitti uumame** (It formed in the central Atlantic) - The text says: ""baha Garba Atilaantikiitti uumame"" (formed in the central Atlantic).
* **C: Haarikeeniitti jijjiiramuu danda’a** (It can turn into a hurricane) - The text says: ""Saayintistootni Giddugala Biyyaalessaa Hariikeen Daani’eel gaafa Roobi gara hariikeenitti akka jabaatu raajan."" (Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict Daniel will strengthen into a hurricane by Tuesday).
* **D: Sosocho’iinsa lafaatti dhiyoodha** (It is far from land) - The text says: ""Obonboleettichi, inni Maayaamii, Filooriidaa irraa timaamaan maayilii 3,000 irratti argamu..."" (The storm, located 3,000 miles east of Miami, Florida...) showing it's quite distant.

"Akkaataa Ibsa kanaatti, wanti yaadame dirqama osoo weerara addunyaa hin ta’in raawwatamuu qaba?","Correct answer: **A: Lubbuu kan hin balleessine ta’uu qaba**

Here's why:

The passage states Dr. Lii fears the virus could be ""less lethal than a pandemic,"" meaning it would cause illness without widespread death. This aligns directly with option A, that the disease should not be life-threatening.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mallattoon isaa giddu galeessatti hafuu qaba** - The passage mentions mild symptoms are a concern *because* they could allow spread, not that mild symptoms are a requirement.
*   **C: Namoonni hedduun dhukkubichaan qabamuu qabu** - The passage doesn’t suggest a need for widespread infection.
*   **D: Ijoolleen mallattoo kana of irratti arguu qabu** - The passage doesn't mention anything about children specifically.



"
"Akkaataa ibsa kanaatti, Tayfoniin kun Fujian irraa hangam fagaata?","The correct answer is **C: Kilomeetira 70**.

Here's why:

The text states the typhoon was 70 kilometers away from the Fujian province administrative area. 

Let's break it down:

* **""Ijni Moraakoot naannoo Kiilomeetira torbaatamaa kutaa bulchiinsa Chaayinaa Fujiyaan arra fagoo ture.""** translates to ""The Morakot storm was 70 kilometers away from the Fujian province administrative area.""



"
Ji’orgi W. Buush yeroo Eeshiyaa qaqabetti eenyutu dubbiseeni?,"The correct answer is **D: Itti aanaa Muummicha Ministeeraa**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Inni Itti aanaa Muummicha Ministeeraa Singaappoor Wong Kan Seng’n wal dubbisee..."" (He spoke with the Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore Wong Kan Seng...). 

Therefore, George W. Bush spoke with the Deputy Prime Minister during his visit to Singapore."

Here's why:

The text states: ""Walakkaa filannoo keessatti erga mo’umsa torban tokkoo booda, Bush hordoftootatti waa'ee Eeshiyaa keessatti daldala babal'isuu dubbate."" This directly translates to ""After his re-election, Bush spoke to supporters about expanding trade in Asia.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yeroo Siingaappooriin qaqqabe:** While he was in Singapore, the text doesn't say he spoke about trade *during* that time, but *after* the election.
*   **B: Wong Kan Seng waliin:** He discussed trade *with* Wong Kan Seng, but didn't speak *to supporters* about expanding trade during that meeting.
*   **D: Daawwannaa torban tokkoof Eeshiyaa godhe hundaa keessatti:**  The speech specifically happened *after* the election, not throughout the entire trip.



"
"Akkaataa Ibsa kanaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kaayyoon walii galaa mootummaa kami?","The correct answer is **C: Fe’iinsa dabalataa 1,300 argachuu**

Here's why:

The text states the government of Bitooteessa is giving support for harvesting and that an additional 300 *were found*, bringing the total harvest to 1,300.  This indicates the goal is to achieve a total harvest of 1,300.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the support is *for* this year's harvest, the goal isn't just giving money for extra harvest, but *achieving* a certain harvest amount.
*   **B:** 300 is an *addition* to an existing amount, not the overall goal.
*   **D:** The text doesn't mention simplifying difficulties, only a harvest amount.



"
Mootummaan maal awwaje?,"The correct answer is **A: Karoora fe’iisa dabalataa 300f maallaqa kennuu** (Providing funding for an additional debt relief of 300).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Beeksisni har’a akkasumaas of kennu mootummaa kan Bitooteessa waggaa kanati waa’ee deeggarsa mallaqa gochuu irratti kenname achi butera. Teessumni dabalataa 300 ittiin imalan waan argameef..."" (Today's announcement also includes the government of Bitootessa's commitment to financial support for the coming year. An additional 300 was found to cover the debt...)

This directly indicates the government is *providing* funding (deeggarsa mallaqa) for an *additional* debt relief (teessumni dabalataa) of 300.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Rakkoo fe’iinsaa furuuf cichanii jiru** (They are working to solve the debt problem) - While the passage hints at a problem, it doesn't say the government is *working* to solve it, only that the additional funding is *because* of a problem.
* **C: Karoora fe’iisa dabalataa 1,300f maallaqa kennuu** (Providing funding for an additional debt relief of 1,300) - The passage states the *total* debt relief is 1,300, not the amount of the additional funding.
* **D: Rakkoon wal dhiphisuu hanga Bitootessaatti ni furama** (The problem of debt will be solved by Bitootessa) - The passage doesn't say the debt will be solved, only that the government is providing more funding.



"
"Akka Ibsa kanaatti, odeeffannoon beekamu kami?","The correct answer is **A: Sadarkaan balaa hir’ateera**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""haa ta’uuyyu malee, sadarkaan doorsisa gara yaadessatti hir’aachu jechuun waan hundu si dhisee deemera jechuu miti.""  This translates to ""However, reaching a level of desperation does *not* mean abandoning everything and going to ruin.""  This implies that someone *has* reached a level of desperation or hardship (""sadarkaan doorsisa"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Balaan kamiyyuu yeroo ammaa hin jiru:** The passage doesn't state there's no hardship *currently*. It just says desperation doesn't equal complete abandonment.
* **C: Haleellaan akka raawwatamu ni eegama:** The passage doesn’t mention anything about expectations of something happening.
* **D: Akka qorattoonni mirkaneessanitti haleellichi cimaa ha’a:** The passage doesn’t involve any research findings or claims about the severity of something.



"
Ibsa waa’ee morkattootaa ilaalchisee dhugaa kan hin taane?,"The correct answer is **D: Mormitoonni yeroo tokko tokko sarbamiinsa seeraa ni raawwatu** (Protesters sometimes violate the law).

Here's why:

* **The passage states protesters were involved in widespread demonstrations in October.** It also mentions previous elections were marred by fraud, with some issues dating back to 2011.  However, it *doesn't* say the protesters themselves committed illegal acts. It simply states there were issues with previous elections.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Komishiniin pirezidaantichaa mormii kanaaf deebii kenne** (The President's Commission responded to this complaint) - The passage explicitly states the commission responded to the concerns.
* **B: Filannoon yeroon irra darbe mormii kanaaf sababa bu’uuraa ta’e** (The past election was a root cause of this complaint) - The passage links the current complaints to issues and fraud in previous elections.
* **C: Mormitoonni dursaan CEP hojii isaanii irraa akka gadi lakkisan fedhu** (Protesters previously wanted CEP to step down from their duties) - The passage states the commission asked CEP to consider suspending election preparations, stemming from the protests. This implies the protesters wanted change.



Therefore, option D is the only statement *not* supported by the provided text."
CEP inni xumuraa hojii isaarra akka gadi lakkisu eenyu yaada kenne?,"The correct answer is **C: Komishinii pirezidaantichaa** (The Presidential Commission).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ji’a darbe koomishiniin pireezidaantii akka paakeejii tarkaanfiiwwan biyyattiii gara filannoo haaraatti sochoosuutti dursa hojii gad-lakkisuu CEP akka yaadaatti dhiheesse.""  This directly translates to ""Last month, the presidential commission suggested that CEP reduce its work as a package of national plans are moved to the new election.""

Therefore, the Presidential Commission is the one who suggested CEP reduce its work.



"
"Akka Ibsa kanaatti, Naasar atileetota irraan miidhaa waan geessiseef Jimnaastikiin USA maal hin deeggaru?","Correct answer is **A: Mirkaneessa haquu**.

Here's why:

The text states that the USA Gymnastics investigation ""found that the years of abuse by Larry Nassar were not properly reported, and changes were not made."" This directly implies that USA Gymnastics *failed* to hold Nassar accountable and protect athletes.  ""Mirkaneessa haquu"" (seeking accountability) is therefore what they did not do.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Naannoo kaka’umsa qabu uumuu:** The text focuses on the *failure* to address abuse, not creating a harmful environment.
*   **C: Dhaabbaticha keessatti Jijjiiramoota barbaachisoo:** The text highlights the *lack* of changes made, meaning they didn’t implement necessary changes.
*   **D: Qorannoo of danda’e:** The text actually states USA Gymnastics *did* conduct an investigation, but it was too late and didn't lead to proper action previously.

"Akka Ibsa kanaatti, kaayyoo guddaan Jimnaastikii USA fi Koreen Olompiikii Yuunayitid Isteeti gara fuula duraatti maali dha?","Correct Answer: **D: Atileetotaaf naannoo mijataa ta’e kennuu**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Jiimnastikiin Ameerikaa fi USOC galmaa tokko qabu — Ispoortii Jiimnastikii fi kanneen biroo hamma danda’ameen kan yaddoo balaa malee taphatootni akka abjuu isaanii karaa nagaa, Poozativaa fi naannoo naannoo hamilee horu keessatti hordofan gochuudha.""

This directly translates to: ""Gymnastics America and the USOC have a common goal - to create a safe, positive, and supportive environment for athletes to pursue their dreams in gymnastics and other sports."" This means prioritizing a safe and beneficial environment (naannoo mijataa) for athletes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Balaa Leerii Naasaar geggeessise irratti ifa baasuu:** While the text mentions the Larry Nassar abuse, the main focus isn't *just* exposing the abuse, but preventing future abuse and creating a safer environment.
*   **B: Mirkaneessa haqame hordofuu:** The text does not highlight a specific ""wrongdoing"" that needs to be followed up.
*   **C: Qorattoota dhuunfaa hordofuu:** The text mentions an internal investigation, but doesn't emphasize tracking down individual researchers.



"
Yeroo balichi uumametti dooniin gara eessaatti adeemaa ture? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palawan**.

Here's why:

The passage states the ship was traveling ""from the road towards Puerto Princesa Palawan"" when the incident occurred. This indicates Palawan was the destination the ship was heading towards at the time of the event.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yuunayitid Isteeti (United States)** - The passage mentions the US being involved, but not as the ship's destination.
*   **B: Poorte Riikoo (Port Rico)** - This location is not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Jaappan (Japan)** - While US bases in Japan are mentioned as receiving the survivors, Japan wasn't where the ship was going.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee doonii eeramee dhugaa kan hin taanee kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Doonii albuuda tarkaanfiiwwan farra ittisuu dha** (The ship is a naval vessel for combating piracy).

Here's why:

* **The passage states the ship was traveling *to* Puerto Princesa, Palawan (A & B are true).** It mentions it was *coming from* the sea, heading *towards* Puerto Princesa.  It also explicitly states Palawan is where it was heading.
* **The passage identifies the ship as being handed over to American forces – the 7th Fleet and Sasebo, Nagasaki, Japan (D is true).** It specifically mentions these units.
* **The passage does *not* state the ship is a naval vessel designed for anti-piracy work.** It simply describes its movement and the forces it was handed over to. This is an inference *not* supported by the text.

Therefore, option C is the only statement that cannot be verified as true based on the provided text."
Waa’ee loltoota US walqabatee eenyutu ibsicha qaqqabsiise?,"The correct answer is **A: Doonalid Tiraampi**.

The text states: ""Dilbaata waaree booda, Pireezidantiin Ameerikaa Doonaaldi Tiraampi, karaa barreessaa pireesii ibsa kennaniin, akka loltootni Yuunaayitid Isteetsi Sooriyaa keessaa akka ba’uufjiran dubbatan."" (After a while, the President of America Donald Trump, through a press release, stated that US fighters in Syria would withdraw.)

This clearly indicates that Donald Trump was the one who made the statement regarding the US fighters.



"
"Akka hima kanaatti, biyya kamtu qabsaa’ota booji’aman eeguuf itti gaafatamummaa fudhate?","The correct answer is **C: Yuunayitid Isteeti** (United States).

Here's why:

The passage states that President Trump said the US would be taking responsibility for captured ISIS fighters *after* speaking with the Turkish President. It also mentions European countries refusing to take them back. This implies the US is stepping in to handle the responsibility that others are declining. 

While Syria *holds* the fighters, the text indicates the US is taking on the *responsibility* for what happens to them.



"
Sababi balaa xiyyaarichaa maali jedhamee amanama?,"The correct answer is **C: Mancaatii lafa ol ka’aa** (Landslide).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mancaattin lafa ol ka’aa gaara fakkaatu keessatti ta’ee..."" which translates to ""The accident happened in a mountainous area with a landslide..."" and ""...ani bu’aa abidda soodachisaa jedheen amane."" which translates to ""...I believed it was caused by a landslide.""

Therefore, the speaker believes the crash was caused by a landslide.



"
Mancaatiin haala akkamiin balaan kun akka qaqqabuu taasise?,"The correct answer is **D: Lafa ol ka’aa** (High ground/elevated terrain).

Here's why:

The passage states ""Mancaattin lafa ol ka’aa gaara fakkaatu keessatti ta’ee..."" which translates to ""Mancaatti was in a high, mountain-like terrain...""  This terrain is then directly linked to the speaker's belief that it gave them an advantageous position (""bu’aa abidda soodachisaa""). The difficult weather conditions (bad weather and bad ground) further emphasize how the *location* made the situation challenging.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kan diinaa (The enemy):** The enemy isn’t a *place* that caused the situation to be difficult.
* **B: Mancaatii (Mancaatti):** Mancaatti is a person, not a geographic feature contributing to the difficulty.
* **C: Gamtaan (The army):**  The army isn't a place, and while involved in the situation, doesn't explain *how* the situation was difficult.



"
Sababa lolaan aanga’ootni maal abdachaa jiru?,"The correct answer is **A: Cirracha deebisanii ijaaruu (Restoring the forests)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Biyyeen kun tuullaa cerrechaa fi handaara galaanaa kan bineensota bosonaaf akka bidolleettii tajaajilu uumuuf barbaachisaadha."" (This country needs to create a refuge for forest animals by restoring forests and green areas.)  And then ""aangawootni garuu hammi biyyee dhiqamee deebi’uu danda’a jedhanii abdatuu."" (The officials, however, believe the country's wounds can be healed and restored.) 

This clearly indicates the officials hope to restore the forests (cerrechaa) that were damaged by the war.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Qarqara galaanaa deebisanii ijaaruu (Restoring the green areas):** While restoring green areas is *part* of the goal, the primary focus is on the forests (cerrechaa).
* **C: Lakkoobsi hambaak chab dabaluu (Increasing the number of wild animals):** Increasing animal numbers is a *result* of restoring their habitat, not the officials' direct aim.
* **D: Bakki jireenya bineensota bosonaa heddummaachuu (Increasing the living space of forest animals):** Similar to C, this is a consequence, not the core hope.



"
Ijaarsi hidhichaa kanneen armaan gadii keessaa isa kam irratti dhiibbaa dhaabbataa geessiseera?,"Correct answer is **C: Bineensota bosonaa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Biyyeen kun tuullaa cerrechaa fi handaara galaanaa kan bineensota bosonaaf akka bidolleettii tajaajilu uumuuf barbaachisaadha."" (This country needs to create a breeding ground for forest animals with clean water and fresh pasture.) This directly links the dam construction to benefiting forest animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cirraacha galaanaa (Fresh pasture)** - While mentioned, it's a *result* of the dam, not the main reason for its construction.
*   **B: Hambaak chab (Amber)** - This is mentioned as something that was lost, but not as a reason for building the dam.
*   **D: Babal’achuu seedimentii (Sedimentation)** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
"Akka hima kanaatti, eenyutu waa'ee haleellaa raawwatamuu danda'u Yuunaayitid Isteet intelif kenne?","Correct answer: **C: Madda hin ibsamne**

Here's why:

The text states the warning came from the United States, and that the source was ""unidentified"" (""madaa hin beekamne"" in Afaan Oromoo). This translates to an undisclosed or unnamed source. Therefore, the correct answer is ""Madda hin ibsamne"" (unidentified source)."
Ibsoota armaan gadii keessaa sirriitti karoora haleellaa fiinxaalessitootaa kan ibsu kami?,"Correct answer: **B: Biyyoota lamaanitti boombii dhoosuu**

**Explanation:**

The text clearly states the threat involves attacks in *both* Kenya and Ethiopia (""Keeniyaa fi Iitoophiyaatti"").  Therefore, the correct answer is that the plan is to detonate bombs in two countries.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:**  It specifies attacks in two countries, not just one.
*   **C:**  The text doesn't mention specifically targeting ""well-known locations"" (bakkoota beekamoo) within those countries, just the countries themselves.
*   **D:** Again, the threat is to both countries, not just one.



"
Namoota armaan gadii keessaa abukaatoo kan hin taane kami?,"The correct answer is **D: Maakis Triyaantafyilopoliis**.

Here's why:

* **Sakis Kechaagiyoogluu** and **Joorji Nikolaakopaawuloos** are explicitly stated to be judges (abbootii seeraa).
* **Peexiroos Mantoovaloos** is described as a Member of Parliament and a lawyer (abukaatoon).
* **Maakis Triyaantafyilopoliis** is identified as a journalist who presents a show on television (odeeffannoo gaazexessaa...agarsiisa teelevizhinii isaa).  The passage does *not* mention him being a lawyer.

Therefore, Maakis Triyaantafyilopoliis is the only person listed who is not an advocate/lawyer.



"
Hawwaasa seeraa Giriik keessatti namoota garee kamtu akka miidhamtootaatti hineeramne?,"The correct answer is **B: Abbootii Seeraa** (Judges).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...abukaatoon guddichi warra hawaasa Giriik keessattin guddate, yeroo rakkisaa yakka seeraan alaa kan murteessan, **abbootii seeraan**, gorsaa seeraa, namoota hojii seeraa hojjetan baroota darban keessatti."" 

This translates to ""...the prominent lawyer who grew up in Greek society, during a difficult time deciding illegal acts, **judges**, legal advisors, and people working in the legal field over the past years.""

The passage explicitly mentions judges (abbootii seeraa) as being targeted in the corruption scandal. While other groups are mentioned (lawyers, journalists, parliament members), the *initial* focus of the accusations and the group directly identified as being compromised are the judges.



"
Hindiin kiriikeetii meeqa dhabde?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

The passage states: ""erga kaappiteenii wiikeetii dhabdeen booda Indiyaan marsicha xumuruuf dhabiinsa 7aan fiigicha 36 gooteeti."" This translates to ""After losing the captain's wicket, India lost their 7th wicket and scored 36 runs.""

Therefore, India lost 7 wickets."
"Akka hima kanaatti, qabxiin olaanaan tapha kiriikeetii meeqa?","The correct answer is **A: Fiigicha 70**.

The passage states Roobin Utihappaan scored a **high score of 70 runs** in 41 balls with 4 fours and 2 sixes. The other scores mentioned (36) are later in the innings after the captain was out.  The question asks for the *highest score* of the game according to the text."
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa mufannaa Adam Cuerdenf sababa kan hin taane kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Imaammata marsariitii haaraa waa’ee qabiyyee saal quunnamtii ilaalchisee**.

Here's why:

The passage states the public backlash was caused by *existing* inaccurate information about the QAnon conspiracy theory, fueled by media coverage reaching millions. It doesn't say Adam Cuerden's statements *created* new information about QAnon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Aartii Wales haquu:** The passage directly links Cuerden's statements to the problem with Wales.
*   **C: Warra Walesin dhaggeefatamuu dhabuu:** Cuerden felt Wales was *pretending* to listen, which is a problem with being heard.
*   **D: Soba waa’ee sababa haqamuu aartii:** Cuerden initially said the blocking was due to policy, and then later realized Wales was lying/manipulating the situation. This is directly about the reason for the block.

Therefore, the only option that isn't a cause mentioned by Cuerden is the creation of *new* information about QAnon."
"Akka hima kanaatti, marsariitii sana irraa kan balleeffame maali dha?","The correct answer is **B: Qabiyyee saal quunnamtii** (Content moderation).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dheekkamsi hawaasaa carraaqqiiwwan imaammata marsariitii **qabiyyee saalquunnamtii qabanii** kan miidiyaalee eyyemaan banaman miiliyoonotaan lakkaawwaman qopheessan ammaaf sababa ta’eera."" 

This translates to: ""Public outrage over millions of flagged content moderation posts on social media is what caused...""

The text directly links the controversy to issues related to *content moderation* (qabiyyee saalquunnamtii).



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aartii** (Article) - The article *reports on* the controversy, but isn't what was removed.
*   **C: Wixinee imaammataa** (Image Recognition) - This is mentioned as a *tool* used, but not what was the subject of the removal.
*   **D: Miidiyaa nama dhuunfaa** (Independent Media) - This isn't what was removed, but a platform where the controversy played out."
"Akka hima kanaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa Amiir Kahaan kan hin deeggarre kami?","Correct answer is **A: Dubartoota dorgommii lolaa Olompiikii hirmaatan itti dabaluu**

Here's why:

The passage states Amir Khan said, ""Women should not be allowed to box."" This directly means he does **not** support women participating in Olympic boxing competitions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dorgomtoota Biritish:** He supported being a torchbearer for British athletes in the 2012 London Olympics.
*   **C: Yaada warra dubartootaa:** The passage doesn't say he opposes the opinions *of* women, only women boxing.
*   **D: Landan Olompiikii qopheessuu:** He was involved in the London Olympics as a torchbearer, implying support for the event itself.



"
"Akka hima kanaatti, Amir Khan yaada dhuunfaa qabaatus kanneen armaan gadii keessaa isa kam deeggara?","The correct answer is **A: Dubartoota dorgommii lolaa** (Female boxing competitors).

Here's why:

The passage states Amir Khan said, ""Keessa kootti Ani dubartootni loluu hin qaban."" (Inside me, I don't think women should box). He then advocated for British fighters at the 2012 Olympics. This implies he supports *female boxers* participating in the Olympics, despite his personal reservations about women boxing. He is advocating for their inclusion and support.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dorgomtoota isa waliin dorgoman kan Olompiikii 2004** (Competitors he competed with at the 2004 Olympics): The passage doesn't say he supports those specific competitors.
* **C: Olompiikii 2012:** He supported British fighters *at* the Olympics, but doesn't generally support the Olympics itself.
* **D: Meedaaliyaa meetii kan argatan biroo** (Other bronze medal winners): The passage doesn't connect his views to other medalists.



"
Piiter Leenzi yoom du’e?,"The correct answer is **C: Hospitaalatti** (At the hospital).

Here's why:

The passage states that Piiter Leenzi was taken to a nearby hospital after the accident and *died there*. The other options describe events *leading up to* his death, but not the actual time and place of death.

* **A** is incorrect because ""yeroo marfata qaama ho’ifachuu"" (during body recovery) doesn't specify when he died.
* **B** is incorrect because falling off his bike was part of the accident, not the moment of death.
* **D** is incorrect because being with paramedics on the road was before he reached the hospital and died.



"
Zhaaviyeer Zaayaatiin eenyudha?,"The correct answer is **A: Hojjettoota yaalaa daandii irraa** (From the road rescue workers).

Here's why:

The text states ""itti ansees morkataa isaa Zhaaviyeer Zaayaatiin rukutame."" which translates to ""he was helped by his teammate Zhaaviyeer Zaayaati.""  It also says Zayaati was with him at the scene and wasn't injured in the crash. This implies Zayaati was involved in the rescue/emergency response, making him a road rescue worker.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dorgomaa biraa (Another racer):** While he's a teammate, the text focuses on him *helping* Piiter, not racing.
* **C: Dokitara (Doctor):** The text says he was *taken* to the hospital by paramedics, not that Zayaati *is* a doctor.
* **D: Deeggartoota (Fans):**  Fans wouldn't be actively *helping* someone immediately after a crash on the track.



"
Namni balaliisaa yaaddoo keessa jiru tokko hojii keessoo xiyyaara tokkoo hubachuun isaa haala kam keessatti isa fayyaduu danda’a?,"The correct answer is **B: Jibbiinsi balaliisa isaanii sodaa waan hin beekamne irraa yoo kan madde ta'e** (If the source of their confusion stems from an unrecognized fear).

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""…sodaa ofiirraa waan adda bahuu fi jibba wantoota biroo isa namoonni hedduun qabani dha."" (…is often a departure from one's own fear and other common phobias.)  It goes on to say understanding how the brain works and recognizing subtle cues can help identify the *unrecognized* fear.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yoo imaltoonni sodaa isaaniitti qaana’an** (If their anxieties are justified) - The passage doesn't focus on whether fears are rational, but on *identifying* the fear itself.
* **C: Yoo imaltuun gosa geejjibaa hundaaf jibba qabaate** (If the anxiety has a phobia for every type of stimulus) - This is overly broad and doesn't align with the passage’s emphasis on *uncovering* the root cause.
* **D: Yaaddoon isaanii taateewwan dhiphisaa balaliisaa wajjin wal hin qabanne irraa kan madde yoo ta’e** (If their anxiety stems from irrelevant complicating factors) - While irrelevant factors can contribute to anxiety, the passage's focus is on the core, potentially hidden, fear driving the experience.



"
"Kutaa kana irratti hundaa’uun, imaltuun gatii irratti xiyyeeffate kanneen armaan gadii keessaa isa kam dhuma irratti raawwata?","Correct answer is **C: Gatii dhaabbilee imalaa hedduu wal madaalchisa**

**Explanation:**

The passage emphasizes the importance of *not* immediately accepting the first price offered for airline tickets (""Yeroo ammaa kana osoo jalqaba barbaadanii gatii isaanii hin madaalchisfne..."") and comparing prices (""akkasumas bituun duratti marsareetti buufata qilleensichaa ilaaluudha."").  This directly translates to comparing prices from multiple airlines (dhaabbilee imalaa) to find the best deal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dhiyeessii dhaabbilee imalaa hedduu qorataa** (Requesting quotes from many airlines) - While *getting* quotes is part of the process, the passage focuses on what you do *with* those quotes (compare them).
*   **B: Kallattiin daandiin xiyyaaraa irraa ajeja qabsiifadhaa** (Negotiating directly with the airline) - The passage doesn’t mention negotiating.
*   **D: Marsariitii daandii xiyyaaraa sakatta’a** (Searching for available airline routes) - Searching for routes is a necessary first step, but the passage's main point is about price comparison *after* you've found potential routes.



"
"Akka hima kanaatti, imaltoonni gatii balalii isa gaarii ta’e argachuuf dursanii maal gochuu qabu?","The correct answer is **B: Gatii walitti qabattoota adda addaa wal madaalchisaa** (Compare prices from different operators).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that prices can vary between airlines (""balaliin walfakkaataan iddoo garaagaraatti gatiin isaa adda ta’uu danda’a"") and that it's important to look at airline fares before buying (""bituun duratti marsareetti buufata qilleensichaa ilaaluudha"").  This directly supports the idea of comparing prices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Marsariitii daandii xiyyaaraa sakatta’a** (Book airline routes early) - While booking early *can* sometimes help, the passage focuses on *comparing* prices, not just booking early. It states that even with early booking, price comparison is important.
*   **C: Kallattiin karaa daandii xiyyaaraa irraa ajeja qabsiifadhaa** (Get information from airline routes directly) - This is a way to *find* prices, but the core message is to *compare* them.
*   **D: Kallattiin ejenttoota imalaa irraa ajeja qabsiifadhaa** (Get information from travel agents) - Similar to C, this is a source of information, but not the main action the passage suggests.



"
Dhaabbata dhiyeessiif yoom hiriyyaan imalaa barbaachisa?,"The correct answer is **A: Yeroo wantoonni fe’aman karaa qilleensaa ergaman** (When items are shipped by air).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yoo wantoota fireeyiti qilleensaan ergan, karaaleen muraasni bakka ofirritti buusan fi buufataalee bira gahuuf tarii guyyootii fudhachuu danda’a."" (If items are shipped by air, some routes may experience delays and reach destinations after several days). This directly links the need for thorough inspection to air shipments due to potential delays and complexities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yeroo dhaabbatichi xiyyaara ofii isaa fayyadame** (When the company uses its own aircraft) - While the passage mentions large companies having their own planes, it doesn't say inspection is *specifically* needed then.
* **C: Yeroo waantonni mi’a sakatta’ameetti ergaman** (When items are shipped after being declared as minimal value) - The passage says air shipments shouldn't be undervalued (seeriin karaa qilleensaa mi’a imaltootaan ala akka ergamu hin hayyamu), meaning inspection is needed to *prevent* undervaluation, not because it's happening.
* **D: Qaqqabsiisi yeroo dhaabbata guddaadhaan raawwatame** (When supervision is done by a large organization) - This isn't mentioned as a trigger for inspection.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ati sirriiiti eeggannodhaan dhaabbataa balalii yeroo baay’ee fayyadamtu filachuu qabda."" (You should choose the airline with a good safety record that you frequently use.)  It emphasizes prioritizing routes *you* are used to, because familiarity (frequent use) increases your chances of finding better deals through comparing different airlines on that route.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Daandii xiyyaaraa tuqaa hedduu kennuu** (Flight route with many connections) - The passage doesn’t mention connections; it's about finding good deals on routes you already know.
* **B: Daandii xiyyaaraa gamtaa guddaa keessaa** (Flight route from a large hub) -  While hubs can offer options, the passage prioritizes *your* frequent route.
* **D: Daandii xiyyaaraa filannoowwan dabalataa isiniif dabalu** (Flight route that offers you additional options) - Again, the passage focuses on comparing airlines on a familiar route, not seeking routes with extra options.

"Akka ibsa kanaatti, tuqaa balaliinsaa yeroo baay’ee fayyadamtanii hedduu kan kennu eenyu?","The correct answer is **A: Daandii xiyyaaraa gara garaa gamtaa adda addaa keessa jiran** (Different air routes within different airlines).

Here's why:

The passage states that comparing different airlines (buufata xiyaara adda addaa) is more likely to yield better deals (arjooma caalaa argachuudandeessa) because the available options are varied (carraawwan argaamu danda’aan garaagara waan ta’aniif). This implies that the routes offered by various airlines (daandii xiyyaaraa gara garaa) within different airline companies (gamtaa adda addaa) are the key to finding the best deals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Daandii xiyyaaraa yeroo hedduu ittiin imaltan kan gamtaa wal fakkaataa jalatti argamu** (Frequent routes within the same airline) - The passage emphasizes *different* airlines, not routes within the same one.
* **C: Daandii xiyyaaraa yeroo hedduu ittiin imaltan kan gamtaa kan biraa jalatti argamu** (Frequent routes within another airline) - While comparing airlines is good, the emphasis is on the *variety* of routes across *different* airlines.
* **D: Daandii xiyyaaraa gara garaa gamtaa wal fakkaataa keessa jiran** (Different routes within similar airlines) - Again, the passage focuses on comparing *different* airlines, not routes within similar ones.



"
"Akka ibsa kanaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa aalikoolii hedduu fayyadamuun miirri miidhamu isa kami?","The correct answer is **B: Agartuu**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Dhugaatii hammaan olii irraa dhukkuboonni ka’u danda’an miidhamuu tiruu fi **keessumayyu agartu dhabuufi du’a dabalata**.""  This translates to: ""Excessive alcohol consumption can cause diseases, impair **memory**, and even lead to death.""

Therefore, the text directly links excessive alcohol consumption to impairment of memory (agartuu)."
"Ibsa kana keessatti akka eerameetti, miidhaa aalkooliin fidu hir’isuu kan danda’u maali?","Correct answer: **B: Dhugaatii alkoolii seeraan alaa oomishame dhuguu**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the major danger comes from consuming illegally produced alcohol (""Dhugaatii hammaan olii irraa dhukkuboonni ka’u danda’an miidhamuu tiruu fi keessumayyu agartu dhabuufi du’a dabalata. Sodaan inni guddaan kan dabalu yeroo dhugaatii seeran ala oomishaman fayyadamnu dha.""). It further explains that these illegal alcohols often contain dangerous substances like methanol (""miitanoolii"") which can cause blindness or even death.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Alkoolii meetaanoolii waliin dhuguu:** While drinking methanol is dangerous, the passage focuses on the *source* of the methanol being illegally produced alcohol, not just the act of consuming methanol directly.
*   **C: Alkoolii madaalawaa ta’e dhuguu:** The passage doesn't mention anything about stale or spoiled alcohol.
*   **D: Namoota gara garaa waliin dhuguu:** The passage states alcohol affects people differently, but doesn't link drinking with different people to the dangers mentioned.

Gatiin qabeenyaa ol’aanaa Amsterdam’s keessaa eessa jira?,"The correct answer is **B: Bakka hambaa addunyaa UNESCO ta’ee murtaa’e kamiyyuu keessatti**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the area (Dachii) is a UNESCO World Heritage site *because* of its historical and cultural value. This means the UNESCO designation itself is where the outstanding universal value lies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Muummee Dachii** - While the ""Dachii"" (ring of canals) is important, the passage highlights the *recognition* as a World Heritage site as the key to its value.
* **C: Naannoo Biinenistaad keessaa buqqifame** - Biinenistaad is simply the neighborhood where Dachii is located; it doesn't represent the value itself.
* **D: Bakkoota seena qabeessa ta’an** - This is too broad.  The passage emphasizes that it's a specifically *recognized* historical place, not just any historical place.



"
Maaliif Aanaan Naannoo Dachii akka bakkeewwan hambaa addunyaa UNESCO tti galmaa'e?,"The correct answer is **A: Akka seenaa fi aadaatti iddoo guddaa waan qabuuf** (Because it is a great place in terms of history and culture).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states the area was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site ""sababa aadaa adda ta’ee fi faayidaa seenaa fi hangi qabeenyumma isaas akka biyyaatti guddaa waan ta’eef"" - *because of its unique culture and its great historical and scenic value.*

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Leecalloo addaa waan qabuuf** (Because it has unique canals) - While canals are mentioned, they aren't the primary reason for UNESCO status.
* **C: Bakki isaa Biinenistaaditti marsee waan jiruuf** (Because it is located near Binendstad) - Location is not the defining reason for heritage status.
* **D: Leecalloo gatii olaanaa qabu waan ta'eef** (Because it has high-value canals) - Similar to B, canal value isn't the core reason.

"Akka kutaa kanaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu daawwannaa Phinoom Kiroomin gatii akka qabaatu taasisa?","The correct answer is **A: Toonlii Saap irraan ilaaluu**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Daawwannaan bakkee sanaa haala mijataa ta’een imala bidiruudhaan gara galaanichaatti godhamu waliin walitti dabalamuu danda’a."" and ""Darbiinsi Aangikoor gara mana mootummatti seenuuf nii barbaachisaa kanaaf paasporti kee Toonlii Saap waliin fidee dhufuu hin dagaatin.""  These lines clearly indicate that viewing from Toonlii Saap and having your passport checked *with* Toonlii Saap are necessary for a successful visit/observation. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Karaa Aangikoor irra imaluu:** While mentioned, it's about needing permission to go *to* the palace, not what makes the visit to Phinoom Kiroomin valuable.
* **C: Sii’eemi Ripii ilaaluu:** This simply states the location of Phinoom Kiroomin.
* **D: Imala doonii gara haraatti:**  This isn't mentioned in the text.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, daawwattoonni Phinoom Kiroomin seenuuf maaltu isaan barbaachisa?","The correct answer is **C: Darbiinsi Aangikoor argachuu**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Darbiinsi Aangikoor gara mana mootummatti seenuuf nii barbaachisaa kanaaf paasporti kee Toonlii Saap waliin fidee dhufuu hin dagaatin."" This translates to ""You will need a pass from Angikoor to enter the palace, so don't delay in obtaining your passport with Toonlii Saap.""  Therefore, obtaining the Angikoor pass is a requirement for visitors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mana sagadaa Yaasoovarman irra utaalanii ce’uu** (Getting permission from Yaasoovarman's palace) - The text doesn't mention needing permission *from* the palace itself, but rather a pass *to* enter it.
* **B: Naannoo Sii’eemi Ripii imaluu** (Being near Si'eemi Ripii) - Being near the location is not a requirement, the pass is.
* **D: Naannoo Toonii dooniin adeemuu** (Traveling by boat near Toonli) -  This is irrelevant to the requirements for visiting Phinoom Kiroomin.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa tuuristoonni Antaartikaa akka hin daawwaane dhorkuu kan danda’u kami?","The correct answer is **D: Qaamaan bakkaa bakkatti socho’uu muraasa** (Having a physically demanding trip).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...qaamni ga’aa ta’uus gaafata..."" (physical fitness is required) and ""...Daawattoonni qilleensaa ogeeyyii darbanii darbanii dhufan gaara ba’uuf yookaan Moggaa, isa buufata addaa qabu bira ga’uuf gara keessaatti adeemu."" (Experienced climbers come to climb mountains or reach remote camps). This highlights that Antartica tourism is *physically challenging*.  The trip demands a certain level of fitness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baasiin imalaa qaalii ta’uu** (High cost of travel) - The text mentions tourism is expensive (""baayee gatiin mi’aa dha""), but this doesn’t *prevent* people from going, it just makes it less accessible.
*   **B: Fedhii dhuunfaatti galaana Roos qorachuuf qabaachuu** (Having a personal desire to explore Lake Rose) - While Lake Rose is mentioned, it’s not presented as a barrier to entry for tourists.
*   **C: Sagantaa hojii Muddee fi Amajjii keessa imala gochuu nama dandeessisu** (Being able to schedule a trip in July and August) - The text says tourism happens *between* September and November, not July and August.



"
Tuuristiin gaara irratti ol ba’uu fedhu kutaa Antaartikaa kamiin daawachuu mala?,"The correct answer is **C: Peeninsulaa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Daawattoonni qilleensaa ogeeyyii darbanii darbanii dhufan gaara ba’uuf yookaan Moggaa, isa buufata addaa qabu bira ga’uuf gara **keessaatti adeemu**.""  The text also says ""bakka qarqara galaanaa, oddolawwan fi Galaana Roozii jedhamutti kan daanga’eedhas.""

The context implies that ""keessaatti adeemu"" refers to a place where tourists go to climb mountains or reach specific features. While the text mentions other locations, it specifically links mountain climbing (gaara ba’uuf) to going *into* a region. It also states that tourists go to Moggaa (a feature with unique cliffs) to climb.  

Since ""Peeninsulaa"" is the only option that encompasses mountainous terrain and the opportunity for climbing (as implied by Moggaa), it is the most logical answer. The other options are less likely to be destinations for mountain climbing.



"
Qorannoon dursa ammayyaa xiqqeenyaan eessatti argama?,"The correct answer is **A: Bakka salphaatti argamuu danda’u**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...yeroo ammaa kana osoo hin taane salphaafi mijaataadha."" ( ""...unlike today, it is easy and convenient.""). This directly indicates that early research could be found in easily accessible places. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Giddu gala magaalaa** - While it *could* be in a city center, the text doesn't specifically say so.
* **C: Bakka fagoo** - The text contrasts early research with modern telescopes which *are* in remote locations.
* **D: Mooraa kolleejjii** - While museums or educational institutions are mentioned, the passage emphasizes the *ease of access* of early research, not specifically its location within a college campus.



"
Teleskooppii qorannoon ammayyaa mana eessa keessa taa’uu danda’a?,"The correct answer is **B: Mooraa yuuniversitii** (University campus).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...yeroo baay`ee magaalotaa fi mooraa keessatti argamu..."" (often found in cities and campuses...) and ""...teeleskooppiiwwan ammayyaa hedduun isaanii meeshaalee guguddoo bakkeewwan fagoorra jiranidha, haala qilleensa naannoo mijataa wajjin."" (many modern telescopes are large instruments located in remote areas, with favorable atmospheric conditions). This implies they are located on university campuses or in areas affiliated with research institutions to support the specialized conditions they need.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Godaambaa keessa (Inside a cabinet):** Telescopes are not typically stored in cabinets.
* **C: Naannoo bakka barnootaa (Near a school):** While related to education, ""mooraa yuuniversitii"" is more specific and accurate for research telescopes.
* **D: Mooraa guddaa keessa (In a large field):** While some telescopes *are* in remote fields, the passage highlights their location within cities *and* campuses. The focus is on a research setting.



"
"Akka hima kanaatti, guyyaa qarqara galaanaa tasgabbaa'aa ta'eef naannoo kamtu gaarii ta'a?","The correct answer is **D: Waitemata Haribari**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Cinaan bishaanii Taamaakii Diraayiv Waatimaataa Heerbar irra jiru, baazaarii magaala qarqaraa Miishin Beey fi St Hiiler Seentaraal Ookland argama."" This translates to: ""The Tamaki Drive Waterfront on the Waitemata Harbour has beaches near the city markets of Mission Bay and St Heliers Central Auckland.""

The question asks for a good place for a calm beach day. The text implies Waitemata Harbour is where you find these calmer beaches, specifically near Mission Bay and St Heliers. While Mission Bay and St Heliers *are* mentioned, they are *near* Waitemata Harbour, not the harbour itself. Therefore, Waitemata Harbour is the broader, more encompassing correct answer.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: St Heliers** - Is a location *near* a calm beach but not the harbour itself.
*   **B: Miishin Beey** - Is a location *near* a calm beach but not the harbour itself.
*   **C: Haribari Muummee Kaaba** - (North Shore Harbour) The text describes this harbour as having many waves and being less sheltered.



"
"Akka hima kanaatti, bishaan daakuuf bakki nageenyi isaa eegame eessa?","The correct answer is **B: Haribari Muummee Kaaba**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...bayyeen isaanii qarqara bishaanii ashaawadhan guutamoodha bakka bishaan daakaa naga qabeessa wajjin..."" and then specifically mentions this is near ""Qarqari Galaanaa Inni Kaabaa(inni Naannoo Kaaba Harbar)"". This directly links safe swimming to the Kaaba Harbour area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Buufata Diivoon:** While mentioned, the passage doesn't state it's a safe swimming area.
*   **C: Awkilandi Giddu galeessa:** The passage describes specific harbor locations, not the central city.
*   **D: Loongi Beey:** It's mentioned as a location *near* a safe swimming area, but not the safe area itself.



"
"Bakka kutaa sana keessatti ibsame yeroo daawwattan, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu akka sirrii hin taaneetti ilaalama?","The correct answer is **C: Qoosaa qoosuu**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""**Waa’ee dhumaatii Holokaawustis ta’e Naaziis qoosaa hin qoosinaa.**"" (Do not deny the end of the Holocaust or the Nazis.)

This directly forbids denying the Holocaust and Nazism, which is what ""qoosaa qoosuu"" (denying) represents in this context. The other options don't directly contradict the rules laid out in the text.
"
Kunneen keessaa kamtu afaan linguwaa firaankaa ibsa?,"The correct answer is **C: Kan ijaarame**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Afaanotni Ogzilaarii kan **namaan hojjetamee yookiin ijaarame** dha..."" (Ogizarian languages are those **made or constructed** by humans...).  This directly defines Ogizarian languages as *constructed* languages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Namtolchee** - This doesn't relate to the definition of Ogizarian languages given in the text.
* **B: Kan uumamaa hin taane** - While true (they aren't natural languages), the passage doesn't *define* them primarily by being unnatural. It focuses on them being *made* by people.
* **D: Orgaanikii** - This means ""organic"" and has no relevance to the passage's discussion of constructed languages.



"
Ibsa kamtu afaanota gargaartuu sirriitti hin ibsu?,"The correct answer is **A: Isaanis afaanota orgaanikii namoota karaa biraatiin wal hubachuu hin dandeenye gidduutti walqunnamtii mijeessuudhaaf itti fayyadamanidha.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states that *pidgins* (Afaanotni Ogzilaarii) are created when people with different languages need to communicate.** They are *not* naturally occurring organic languages. They are *constructed* for communication between groups who don't share a common language. Option A describes them as organic and used when people *can't* understand each other, which is the opposite of their purpose.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

* **B: Afaanota uumamaa fi ijaaramani dha** (They are natural and created languages) - The text distinguishes between natural languages and pidgins, which are *ijaaramani* (created).
* **C: Afaanota haala rakkisaa quunnamtii fooyyessuuf ijaaramani dha** (They are created languages to simplify difficult communication) - The passage says they are ""kalaqamaan namoota giddutii yoo ta’uudha baate kan haasaan wal qunnamuuf rakkatan"" - created when communication is difficult.
* **D: Isaanis afaanota uumaman kanneen dubbattoota afaan gara garaa gidduutti olaantummaa qabanidha** (They are languages that gain prominence among speakers of different languages) - The passage states they “kanneen afaanota uumamaa ykn jalqabaa sababa tokkoof ykn kan biraaf akka mala waliin-dubbii dubbattoota afaanota biroo gidduutti caalaa iddoo fudhataa dhufaniidha.” – they often gain a more prominent place as a means of communication between speakers of other languages.

"Akka ibsa kanaatti, imaltoonni yoo imalli bashannanaa isaanii gaafa bonaa ta’e maal adda baafachuu qabu?","The correct answer is **B: Ulaagaa viisaa** (Visa documents).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Imaltoonni doonii ulaagaawwan visaa irraa bilisa (ulaagaalee mirkaneessaa)."" This translates to: ""Passengers of the ship quickly receive visa documents (verified documents).""

The question asks what immigrants need to differentiate when their immigration status is approved. The text directly links fast processing to visa documents. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bakkee hojjettoota doonii** (Ship workers' station) - Not mentioned in relation to immigration approval.
*   **C: Tarmoota** (Baggage) - Not mentioned in relation to immigration approval.
*   **D: Hanga yeroo magaalaa keessatti dabarfame** (How much time was spent in the city) - Irrelevant to the immigration process.



"
"Akka ibsa kanaatti, yoo imalli bashannanaa imaltootaa gaafa gannaa ta’e maal gochuu hin qabani?","The correct answer is **B: Cabbii keessa deemuu**.

Here's why:

The passage states that during the South Baltic sea fog, entering the cabin with a sound-amplifying voice (like making a sound inside a bottle) is done because those onboard are *more than anyone else* affected by it.  This implies it's something to *avoid* when the fog is bad.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sa’atii magaalaa keessaa** (City time) - The passage mentions city time in relation to St. Petersburg, but doesn't say anything about avoiding it during the fog.
*   **C: Ulaagaa viisaa** (Visa regulations) - The passage states that sailors quickly receive visa regulations, but doesn’t discuss avoiding them.
*   **D: Qulqulluu Piterisbergiin** (St. Petersburg) - The passage simply mentions the ship's destination, St. Petersburg.

Baarseloonaa keessatti mallattoo fi beeksisaaf afaan Kaataaloon maaliif yeroo baayyee itti fayyadamu?,"The correct answer is **B: Afaan hojii magaalattii isa jalqabaa ture**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...sababni isaas afaan hojii isa jalqabaa ta’uun isaa seeraan hundeeffameera."" ( ""...because it is legally established as the first official language."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bal’inaan afaan Ispaanish caalaa waan hubatamuuf** - While the passage says many understand Catalan, it doesn't say it's *more* understood than Spanish.
*   **C: Baarseeloonaa keessatti afaan filatamaa dha** - The passage states people *prefer* to speak Catalan when possible, but it doesn't equate this to it being the reason for its prominent use in signage.
*   **D: Meetroo fi bakkeewwan uummataa biroo irra caalaa lammiilee afaan Kaataaloon dubbatanii dha** - The passage doesn't connect the frequency of Catalan speakers to the use of the language in signage.



"
Afaan armaan gadii keessaa isa kamtu beeksisa idilee sirna geejjiba baaburaa Baarseloonaa keessaatti hojiirra oola?,"The correct answer is **C: Ispaanishii**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Beeksisoonni dhaabbatoon Baabura lafa jalaa keessaa Kataalan qofaa keessatti himama, garuu gidduutti dhaabbachuun itti hinyaadamin sirna ofii isaatiin beekee akka dubbatu taasifameen afaan Ispaanishii, Ingilizii, Fireenchii, Arabiffaa fi afaan Jaappaanii dabalatee afaanota garaa garaaa hedduudhaan beeksifama."" 

This directly translates to: ""Announcements at the metro stations are only made in Catalan initially, but to ensure everyone understands, they are also made in Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese, among other languages."" 

Therefore, Spanish is used for announcements within the Barcelona metro system."
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, meeshaa isa kamtu Mana ciisichaa gati jabeessaan carraan filatamuu isaa gadi bu’aa dha?","Correct answer: **B: Haala adda ta’een meeshaalee durii mijeessuu**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that a good B&B often centers around *unique* and *preserved* historical features: ""...places with a history of development, often featuring very distinctive architecture and antique furnishings...often contain original building elements, restored areas, and even wells.""  This directly relates to adapting and utilizing existing, older structures and materials (the antique furnishings and original building elements).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Tarreeffama wantoota addatti ba’anii (Offering a variety of amenities):** While B&Bs *can* offer amenities, the passage emphasizes the *character* of the building itself as the primary draw, not just a list of services.
*   **C: Bakkee manaa haalaan qixaa’e (A well-decorated house):** Decoration is a component, but the core appeal, according to the text, is the preservation of original, historical elements.
*   **D: Waayifaayii ariifataa (Efficient staffing):**  The passage touches on labor (handcrafted vs. mass-produced), but doesn't prioritize staffing efficiency as a key factor.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, kanneen arman gadii keessaa isa kamtu qabxii bu’uuraa wal dorgommii Manneen ciisichaa gati jabeessaa gidduuttii taasifamuu miti?","The correct answer is **A: Walfaana miidheksuu (Compromising quality)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on how high-end B&Bs prioritize **quality** - exceptional ambiance and meticulously prepared meals (both breakfast *and* dinner). They focus on sourcing local, high-quality ingredients and maintaining a historical or unique setting.  

* **Compromising quality** directly contradicts this focus. A price war would likely *force* these establishments to cut corners on those key aspects (ingredients, service, atmosphere) to compete. 

Let's look at why the other options are *part* of the competition, but not the core issue of what would damage the fundamental appeal of these B&Bs:

* **B: Heddumminaan waqtiidhaan ciree dhiyeessuu (Consistently providing meals on time):** This is important for good service, but not what *defines* a high-end B&B. It's a basic expectation, not a competitive advantage.
* **C: Siree baay’ee adda ta’e (Very unique ambiance):** The passage explicitly states that a unique ambiance is a key feature.
* **D: Nyaataa fi dhugaatii naannootii dhihaatan (Offering local food and drink):**  This is also a key element of the described B&Bs.



Therefore, sacrificing quality to win a price war would be the most damaging thing for a B&B focused on a high-end experience."
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu Bara 2022tti Beejingi keessatti hin qophaa’u?","The correct answer is **B: Sagantaa naannoo Taizicheng ski**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Taizicheng ski resort is located **220 km (140 miles) from Beijing** in Zhangjiakou. This means the skiing events were *not* held in Beijing itself. The passage mentions Beijing prepared the opening/closing ceremonies and indoor games, but doesn't say Taizicheng was *in* Beijing.

The other options are explicitly stated as things Beijing prepared for:

*   **A: Sirna baniinsaa** (Opening/Closing Ceremonies)
*   **C: Sirna cufiinsaa** (Security arrangements)
*   **D: Qophee cabbii mana keessaa** (Indoor games preparation)"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu Bara 2022tti Beejingiin keessatti qophaa’a?","The correct answer is **A: Olompikii Bonaa**.

The passage explicitly states that Beijing hosted the 2022 Winter Olympics (Olompikii Bonaa). While it also mentions preparations for the Olympics and other venues, the main event held *in* Beijing was the Winter Olympics.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Qophiilee cabbii mana keessatti taasifaman** - These were preparations *for* the Olympics, not the event itself.
* **C: Olompikii Gannaa** - The passage states Beijing was the first city to host both Winter *and* Summer Olympics, but doesn't say the Summer Olympics were held in 2022.
* **D: Sagantaa cufiinsaa** - This was part of the preparations, not the event itself.



"
Eenyutu carraa olaanaa infuluweenza Aviyaaniidhaan qabamuu qaba?,"The correct answer is **C: Hojjettoota horsiisa lukkuu** (Workers in the poultry industry).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Baay'een isaanii namoota horsiisa lukkuu irratti hirmaachisaniiru..."" (Many of them have affected people involved in the poultry industry...). This directly links poultry workers to a higher risk of exposure.

While options A and B are also at risk, the text *specifically* highlights the poultry industry as the group most affected. Option D is incorrect as the text doesn't mention prior illness as a risk factor.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa hima isa kamtu sirriitti Beerd filuu ibsa?","The correct answer is **D: Dhibeen nama irratti gabaafaman hundumtuu du’aaf kan saaxilan ta’an** (The disease is life-threatening for all people it infects).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Rakkoowwan kumaa gadi ta’an namoota irratti gabaasamanii jiru, garuu muraasni isaanii kan nama galaafatanidha."" This translates to ""A small number of cases have been reported in humans, but some of them are fatal.""  This directly supports the idea that the disease *can* be deadly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hojjettoota horsiisa lukkuu qofatu dhukkubichaan hubame** (Only poultry workers have been infected with the disease) - The passage states poultry workers have been affected, but also mentions it can affect *people* generally, and that some cases occur even with limited bird contact.
* **B: Dhukkubicha baay’inaan simbirroota caalaa nama irratti gabaafame** (The disease is more commonly spread to humans than birds) - The passage clearly states it affects birds *and* humans, but doesn't say which it spreads to more often.
* **C: Daawwattoonni simbiraa carraa hubamuu qabu** (Bird watchers should be concerned) - While caution is wise, the passage doesn't specifically focus on bird watchers.



"
Ulaan Waayit Sii-Baaltiikii maal walitti qabsiisa?,"The correct answer is **B: Hara Oneegaa Voolgaa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Haroon Ooneegaa Voolgaa waliin wal qabatee jira, kanaafu galaana Kaspiyaan irraa karaa Raashiyaa dhufuun ammayyu ni danda’ama.""  This directly translates to ""Lake Onega is connected to the Volga, therefore it is now possible to come from the Caspian Sea through Russia."" 

This shows that Lake Onega and the Volga River connect the Caspian Sea to the rest of the Russian waterway system. Therefore, they are what the White Sea-Baltic route connects.

"Akka kutaa kanaatti, imaltoota addaan kutuu dhiisuudhaaf, Paaspoortiin gosoota konkolaataa kam irratti funaanamuu qaba?","The correct answer is **B: Baaburootaoo halkanii keessa rafamu** (Vehicles involved in accidents).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Baaburoota halkanii keessa rafamu keessatti, hirribaa akka ati hindammaqnetti paaspoortiin nama isa kaffaltii sassaabuun walitti qabamuu mala.""  This directly translates to: ""In the case of vehicles involved in accidents, it is mandated to have the passport of the person paying the insurance to be recorded.""

Therefore, passports are required for vehicles involved in accidents, not generally for all vehicles, boats, or those exceeding speed limits.
"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, Baaburoota daangaa ce’an muraasa irratti, Waraqaan Eennummeessaa kee yoom sakatta’amuu mala?","The correct answer is **A: Erga Baabura irraa bu’amee** (After getting off the vehicle).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bakki sakattii godaansaa yeroo baayyee xiyyaara,doonii yookaan immoo konkolaataa biroo irraa yeroo bu’antti bakka dhaabbannaa jalqabaati."" This directly translates to ""The inspection point is often near the airport, port or other vehicle's exit point.""  It means the check happens *after* you disembark from the vehicle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Yeroo hirribaatti** (At the checkpoint) - The passage doesn't specify the check happens *at* the checkpoint itself, but rather after leaving the vehicle.
*   **C: Hin sakatta’amu** (It is not checked) - The passage clearly indicates a check *does* occur.
*   **D: Baabura deemu irratti** (On the vehicle) - The passage states the check happens after you *leave* the vehicle.

Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu yeroo turtii gammoojjiiwwan Singaapporitti taasifamutti akka rakkootti ka’uu danda’a?,"Correct answer is **C: Ho’a cimaadhaan dararamuu**.

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that Singapore has a ""tiroopikii ol ka’aa"" (tropical high) which causes significant temperature fluctuations:

*   **Ho’aa (hot):** always present.
*   **Aduu cimaa (very humid):** especially when the sky is clear.

This implies that the high humidity coupled with intense heat can be a challenge during the Singapore Grand Prix, potentially leading to drivers struggling with heat exhaustion or car performance being affected.

Let’s look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Saamamuu (Rain):** While rain is possible in Singapore, the passage doesn’t focus on it as a particular difficulty.
*   **B: Suuqiin argamuu dhabuu (Lack of market access):** This is irrelevant to a race track situation.
*   **D: Karaan nama harkaa baduu (Road being too narrow):** The passage doesn't mention anything about the track’s width."
Eenyutu keekota Jarmanii Nyaachuu dhiisuu mala?,"The correct answer is **A: Nama alarjikii muduraawwan qola jabaa qabanii qabu** (People with allergies to strong nuts).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nyaatonni Jarmanootaan tolfaman aalmondii, haazelnaat akkasumas ija mukaa kanneen biroo of keessaa qabu."" (German pastries often contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts).  This means people with nut allergies would need to avoid them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nama nyaata dhuma irratti nyaataman gatii cimaadhaan barbaadu** (People who want expensive treats at the end of their meals) - The text doesn't mention price.
*   **C: Nama Chokoleetii hin jaallanne** (People who don't like chocolate) - While some pastries might have chocolate, it's not a defining characteristic of *all* German pastries.
*   **D: Nama dhamdhama kuraawaa caalaa dhamdhama miaawaa filatu** (People who prefer the taste of caramel over flour) - The text doesn't mention caramel or a preference for caramel over flour.



"
Mi’a dheedhii isa kamtu qabiyyee waqtiidhaanii kan keekii Jarmanii jedhamee fudhatama?,"The correct answer is **A: Appilii (Apples)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pasterootni Fudura beekamoo dha, Apiliin Pasterii waliin toshamuun waggaa guutuu..."" This translates to ""Plums are famous, especially when preserved with apples for a whole year..."" This highlights apples as a key ingredient in traditional German cakes/pastries and a specific pairing with plums.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hazelnaatii (Hazelnuts):** While mentioned as an ingredient *in* some pastries, it's not the defining flavor or ingredient associated with German cakes in the text.
* **C: Plamsii (Plums):** Plums are mentioned, but *with* apples - they are not the defining ingredient.
* **D: Aalmondii (Almonds):** Almonds are also mentioned as an ingredient, but not as central to the traditional German cake as apples.

""Wal'aansoo ittiin qabuu simachuu danda'u"" translates to ""able to control their spending"" or ""able to live within limits."" This aligns directly with the advice given for people with limited budgets.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nama yeroo sirriitti daanga’e hin qabne** (Someone who doesn't have a fixed time) - Time management isn’t related to budgeting.
*   **C: Nama yeroo imalu fagoorraa hojjechuuf karoora qabu** (Someone who plans to work remotely when freelancing) - This describes a work style, not a personality trait related to budgeting.
*   **D: Nama karoora imalaa hordofuu jaallatu** (Someone who likes to follow an imalu plan) - This is too general. While planning is good, the passage focuses on *restricting* spending, not just having a plan.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states that mobile service is *very good* on other routes, specifically citing Pennsylvania Wilds as an example.** This directly contradicts the idea that mobile service *requires* attention (meaning it's poor).

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

*   **A: Karaa baadiyyaa dheeraatu jira (The route is long and rural):** The text describes it as a long, winding road through the countryside.
*   **B: Karaan dhiphaa dha (The road is difficult):** The passage explicitly mentions ""lafa baay'ee gad jedhaa, karaa dhiphoo, marfata dhiphaa hedduu"" (very low terrain, difficult roads, many curves).
*   **C: Daangaan saffisaa seeraan hin kabajaman (Speed limits are not respected):**  The text states drivers often exceed the posted speed limits.

"kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu konkolaachistoota karaa guddaa Baafaaloo-Pitisbargi irra imalan irraa xiyyeeffannoo guddaa barbaada?","Correct answer is **A: Haala konkolaachisummaa cimaa ta’e namatti uumuu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Daandii Guddaa Baafaloo-Pitisbargi... haala konkolaachisummaa hunda caalaa rakkisaa ta’e namatti uuma."" (The Buffalo-Pittsburgh Great Road... evokes the most challenging driving experience). This directly identifies the intense driving conditions as the major concern for drivers on that road.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hanqina tajaajila bilbilaa gahaa ta’ee (Lack of adequate cell service):** While the passage mentions strong cell service in other areas like Pennsylvania Wilds, it doesn't indicate a *lack* of service on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh road is a major issue.
* **C: Ariitiidhaan kofa xiqqoo irratti naanna’uu (Navigating small openings with artistry):** This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Irra deddeebiin hojiin karaa quunnamuu (Repeated work on the road):** While the road is described as heavily patched (""lafa ammas ammas ciramee""), the *challenge of driving* due to these conditions is the primary concern, not just the roadwork itself.



"
kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu kaaniyooniingiif barbaachisu?,"The correct answer is **D: Yaalii sochii qaamaa xiqqaa**.

Here's why:

The passage states that canyoneering ""...requires a small physical effort or a small change in body position (for example, bending to scoop water, holding onto gear in a stream to stay afloat, or lowering oneself from a boulder).""  This directly indicates a *small physical effort* or *small change in body position* is necessary. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dandeettii bishaan daakuu (Ability to scoop water):** While scooping water is *an example* of an action within canyoneering, it isn't the fundamental requirement.
* **B: Haala dhaabbataa qaamaa guddaa (Large body position):** The passage specifically mentions *small* changes in body position, not large ones.
* **C: Dandeettii utaaluu (Ability to float):** Floating is just one potential action and isn't the core requirement.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu milkaa’ina Kaaniyooniingiif dirqama ta’uu mala?,"The correct answer is **D: Dandeettii bishaan daakuu** (Ability to swim).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Kaaniyooniingi involves being in the water, fully submerged or at the surface, and includes activities like diving, surfacing, and floating.  It even mentions needing a *small physical movement* or *small body position change* to *initiate the dive*.  This all points to the fundamental requirement of knowing how to swim.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dandeettii atileetiksii olaanaa (High athletic ability):** While helpful, the description focuses on water skills, not general athleticism.
* **B: Muuxannoo bishaan jala daakuu (Diving experience):**  The passage doesn't *require* prior diving experience, just the ability to initiate a dive.
* **C: Waraqaa ragaa Ispoortii sululaa (Swimming sports certificate):**  The passage doesn't mention any need for certification.

"kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, nama konkolaataa isaa keessa buufachuu karoorseef maaltu gargaaruu danda’a?","The correct answer is **A: Hanga dandeettii konkolaataa kee sirriitti hubachuu** (To fully understand the capabilities of your vehicle).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes knowing your own vehicle well (""akka konkolaataa kee ofuufii fi hamma isaa beekuutti barteetta ta’a"") and its limitations before attempting long journeys. It warns that relying on it *too* much can lead to problems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Konkolaataa teessumni isaa ciisuuf eyyemu** (To try to improve your vehicle's condition): While good maintenance is important, the passage doesn't focus on *improving* the car, but understanding its current capabilities.
* **C: Dunkaana:** (Parking): The passage mentions parking as something that *can* cause issues, not something that *helps* someone planning a long trip.
* **D: Qabeenya dhuunfaa qubachuuf ta’u:** (Being willing to sacrifice personal property): This isn't mentioned as a helpful action in the passage.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, konkolaataa keessa buufattoonni yoo Raadaaricha jala turuuf yaadan maal hir’isuutu mala?","Correct answer: **A: Konkolaataa guddaa kan akka SUV yookiin Miinivaanii oofuu**

**Explanation:**

The passage states: ""Makiina dhabuun ni danda’ama yoo minivanii qabaate, SUV, Sedan yookiin Wagon isteeshinii ta’umsi isaanii ciise."" This translates to ""You might be able to avoid a fine if you have a minivan, SUV, sedan or station wagon."" This implies that having a large vehicle (SUV or minivan) can be a problem when trying to avoid radar detection, hence hindering their plan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Imala karaa dheeraa deemuu (Taking a long route):** The passage suggests long routes are *good* for avoiding detection, not hindering a plan.
* **C: Dunkaana magaalaa keessatti yookaan qabeenya dhuunfaa irratti dhaabuu (Parking in the city or on private property):** While parking might be a tactic, the passage doesn’t suggest it will *hinder* their plan.
* **D: Konkolaataa fayyadamanii waliin walitti dhufeenya dhabuu (Losing communication while using the car):** This isn't mentioned in the passage at all.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, eenyutu yeroo lammataaf Kaasabilaankaa ijaare?","Correct answer is **D: Sulxaanota Morokoo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""sulxaanni Morookoo magaalattii haala haaraan akka Daaru Ibaadiyaa tti irra deebi’ee ijaare, maqaan Kaasabilaankaa jedhamu daldaltoota Ispeenii kan daldala isaani achitti bu'uureffataniin kenname."" This directly translates to ""The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city in a new form as Dar al-Baida (White House), the name Casablanca being given by the Spanish merchants who based their trade there."" 

Therefore, the Moroccan sultans were the ones who rebuilt Casablanca. While Spanish merchants later named it Casablanca, they didn't *rebuild* it."
Eeenyutu balaa uumamaa itti aansee magaala ammayyaa Kaasabilaancaa kuffise?,"The correct answer is **B: Poorchugiiz**.

The text states: ""Warri Poorchugiiz kan diiganii fi kirkira lafaa bara 1755 booda dhiisanii deemuu qofaaf maqaa Kaasaa Bilaankaa jedhuun deebisanii ijaaran."" This means the Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt the city (Casa Blanca), giving it that name after leaving. Therefore, they were the ones who caused the devastation."

Here's why:

The passage states: ""isiierga galmeen guddummaan isii kan Lord Byronin warraabamuu ho’aa deemee booda namoota biyya alaa biratti baay’ee beekamtedha."" This translates to ""its fame increased after being praised by Lord Byron, and then it became very well known among foreigners."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kabo da Rooka** - While mentioned, it's a stop on a journey *to* Sintra, not the reason for its fame.
*   **B: Bakka fakkii Maariyaa** - This is a specific site *within* Sintra, not the overall reason for its international recognition.
*   **D: Seenaa jaalalaati** - While Sintra is described as a ""city of love and desire"", the passage doesn't state this is *why* it's famous internationally.

Armeeniyaadhaan maaltu hin beekamne?,"Correct answer is **D: Rippaabilikii isa haaraa**

Here's why:

The passage states that a new republic was formed with Armenian support in Nagorno-Karabakh, but ""not even Armenia recognized it."" This means the newly formed republic lacked recognition, including from Armenia.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Naannoo Nagornoo-Karabaki:** Armenia *does* support this region, even if it doesn't recognize the republic.
*   **B: Lola Warra Azeeris wajjin:** The passage mentions a war *with* Azerbaijan, not a struggle *within* Azerbaijan.
*   **C: Azerbajaan:** Armenia has diplomatic disagreements *with* Azerbaijan, but it recognizes Azerbaijan as a country."
Maaltu walitti dhufeenya Azerbajaan fi Armeeniyaa gidduu jiru irratti dhiibbaa geessisuu itti fufe?,"Correct answer is **D: Naannoo Nagorno-Karabaki**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the conflict originated with the war over the Nagorno-Karabakh region (within Azerbaijan) and that this led to stalled diplomatic relations. The other options are either related but not the *cause* of the conflict (A & B), or represent a failed attempt to resolve it (C).

Here's a breakdown:

*   **A: Armeeniyaanota Azerbajaan keessa jiraatan:** While Armenians *within* Azerbaijan are part of the context, they aren't the initial cause of the conflict.
*   **B: Lola bara 1994:** The 1994 ceasefire is a result of the conflict, not the cause.
*   **C: Waliigaltee Dippilomaatii:** Diplomatic efforts *failed* because of the conflict, they didn't cause it.
*   **D: Naannoo Nagorno-Karabaki:** This is the core issue - the disputed territory that sparked the war and ongoing tensions.

"Yeroo geejjiba gara Chaarlootteetti qabatanitti, maaltu kaffaltii dabalataaf saaxiluu danda’a?","The correct answer is **B: Imaltoota sadii qabaachuu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Imaltoota 2 caalaa waan fe’eef, adabbii olaanaa adabama, kunimmoo kan barbaadamuun caalaa qaala’aadha."" (Because they prefer more than 2 children, they face higher penalties, which are more expensive than required.) This directly indicates that having more than two children leads to extra costs/fees in Charlotte.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Naannoo biraa jiraachuu** - The passage doesn't mention any fees related to living in a different neighborhood.
*   **C: Gara magaalaatti ol deemuu** - The passage doesn't mention fees based on location within the city.
*   **D: Maatii guutuu ta’uu** - While the passage talks about families, it doesn't suggest being a complete family (presumably meaning both parents present) incurs extra costs.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, ijoollee wajjin Chaarlootttee keessa jiraachuu keessatti maaltu akka rakkinaatti ilaalamuu danda’a?","Correct answer: **B: Taaksii qabachuu**

Here's why:

The passage states that families in Charlotte generally avoid using taxis *unless* in a special circumstance, and when they do, it's expensive (""higher penalty than two fares""). This implies taxis are difficult or undesirable to use regularly, making their availability a potential hardship for families with children. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kaffaltii manaa (Rent):** The passage doesn't mention anything about the cost of housing being a problem.
*   **C: Jiraattota naannoo biroo irraa (Other residents):** The passage doesn't indicate any issues with interactions with other residents.
*   **D: Magaalichatti bohaaruu yaaluu (Trying to navigate the city):** While navigating a city with children can always be a challenge, the passage specifically highlights the taxi issue as a unique difficulty in Charlotte.

"Poorchugaalotni osoo hin dhufiin dura, eenyutu kaaba Chiilii to’atee ture?","The correct answer is **D: Inkaanota**.

The text states: ""Osoo jaarraa 16ffaa keessa ummanni Ispaanish hin dhufin dura, Chiiliin kaabaa bulchiinsa Inkaa jala yeroo turtetti..."" This directly translates to ""Before the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, Chile was under the rule of the Incas...""

While the Mapuche later controlled areas of Chile, the Incas were in control *before* the Spanish and before the Mapuche's prominence.

The passage states: ""Karaaleen, baaburri fi bidiruuleen gandoota san wal-quunnamsiisan konkolaataawwan alarraan isaan bira ga’uu hin danda’an."" This translates to ""Roads, buses and mules connect these places, making it impossible to reach them by car."" 

Therefore, people can reach these villages by **bus (baaburri)** or **mule (bidiruuleen)**, but not by car (konkolaataawwan).  Option B accurately reflects this.



"
Jechi Itaalii “Chiinkuwee Teeree” maal ibsa?,"The correct answer is **A: Gandoota Shan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Chiinkuwee Teeree, kan hiiki isaa Lafawwan Shan jedhu, gandoota qarqara galaanaa xixiqqoo shan..."" This directly translates to ""Cinque Terre, whose Italian name means Five Lands, five small coastal villages..."" 

Therefore, ""Chiinkuwee Teeree"" (Cinque Terre) refers to the **Five Lands** (gandoota shan).

This translates to: ""Some boots have studs, and the studs are often applied to shoes and boots for comfort, both for wearing over socks or under socks.""  The passage directly links studded shoes to being good for muddy ground.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kophee koomee dhiphaa qabu** (Shoes with a tight sole) - While a good sole is mentioned, it doesn't focus on the mud aspect.
* **C: kophee koomee dheeraa qabu** (Shoes with a long sole) - Sole length isn't specifically highlighted for muddy conditions.
* **D: Kophee sarxaan isaa iinchii1/5ffaa of jalatti seenu hin qabne** (Shoes whose sole is not less than 1/5 inch) - Sole thickness is mentioned, but isn’t the primary feature for navigating mud.

Kanneen keessaa kamtu yeroo gannaa harkisa karaa cabbii irraa fooyyessuuf hin gargaaru?,"The correct answer is **D: Bishaan (Water)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a problem with *slippery* surfaces causing falls, particularly on roads after rain (""sababni balaa hunda caalaa beekamaan yeroo ganna daandiiwwan, daandiiwwan qarqara""). It then details materials used to provide traction:

*   **Soogidda (Sand):** Provides grit and improves grip.
*   **Dhagaa fooyyee qabu (Pumice):** Similar to sand, offers a rough surface for traction.
*   **Biyyee suphee (Asphalt/Calcium Chloride):** Specifically mentioned as mimicking the grip of human feet/shoes on surfaces.

**Water (Bishaan)**, however, *increases* slipperiness. It's the very thing the passage identifies as contributing to the danger. Therefore, it would not help to reduce the risk of slipping."

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Lafti bilchaataan walakkaa bishaaniitti argamu magaala homaatuu hin qabu"" for the Cook Islands.
*   It also says that the Cook Islands ""daawattoota dulloomoo tokko tokkoo kan Hawaayiin osoo motummaa naannoo hin ta’iin dura fi hoteelotni tuuristootaa guguddoon hin jiraatin duraa isaan yaadachiisa"" implying Hawaii has developed more with cities and large hotels.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lamaanuu hoteelota guguddoo hedduu qabu:** The text specifically states Cook Islands *doesn't* have many large tourist hotels.
*   **B: Lamaanuu birmadummaa hin qabani:** The passage doesn’t discuss the political status of either place.
*   **C: Akkaataa lakkaawii sa’atii wal-fakkaataa waliin qooddatu:** While the passage mentions they share a time zone, this is a similarity, not a difference. The question asks for a *difference*."
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu sirriitti Ayislaandii Cook hin ibsu?,"Correct answer is **C: Magaalonni guddoon ishee Raarootoongaa fi Aytutakii dha**.

Here's why:

*   **The text states:** ""Isaan gurguddoon Raarootoongaa fi Aytutaki"" which translates to ""The largest are Rarotonga and Aitutaki"". However, it also says the islands **do not have cities** (""Lafti bilchaataan walakkaa bishaaniitti argamu magaala homaatuu hin qabu""). So, while Rarotonga and Aitutaki are the largest islands, they aren't cities.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: Hawaayii gaditti xiqqoo dha** – The text directly states: “cittuuwwan kunniin aal tokko tokko akka “Hawaayii down under” tti yaadamu.”
*   **B: Walitti qabama Odolawwanii dha** – The text says: “Inni walitti qabama oddoloawwanii kanoddolawwan 15 kan galaana bal’ina Miliiyoona Kilomeetir iskuweer 2.2 qabuu irra hafamee jiru qabuudha.”
*   **D: Biyyi odolaa kun Hawaayii wajjin akkaataa lakkaawii sa’aatii wal-fakkaataa waliin qooddatu** – The text says: “Hawaayii waliin zoonii sa’atii walfakkaatu keessaa jiraachuu isaaniitiin…”

The text states: ""Sirenan dhabbata reenjarii tokkicha bakka ciisicha fi nyaata ho’aa bakka buufataatti dabalatan kennudha."" This translates to ""Sirena offers both a drinking fountain and a hot food place for ranger stations."" 

The other options only offer a drinking fountain (""La Leona, fi Los Patos nyaata malee bakka ciisichaa qofaa kenna""). Therefore, Sirena is the only one offering both types of facilities."

Here's why:

The text states: ""Haayyama paarkingii Reenjeri buufata Poortoo Jimeenezii eegu irraa fudhachuun ni danda’ama, garuu kaardii liqaa hin fudhatan."" This directly translates to: ""Parking at the Reenjeri entrance at Poortoo Jimenez can be obtained by guarding the parking lot, but credit cards are not accepted.""

Therefore, if you want to pay with cash for parking, you need to go to Poortoo Jimenez.

This directly links *dugdatti-baachuun cabbii irra mucucaachuu* (sliding down the cliff face) to needing to use trees for grip and strong ropes, specifically describing a descent *down the slope* (tabba asi gadi ijaajjuu irratti).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kophee xaawulaa cabbii irraatiin deemuu** (Following the cliff edge) - While mentioned, it's not the action specifically described as involving descending the slope.
*   **B: Mucucoo cabbii baadiyyaa fagoo** (Long distance cliff crossing) - This refers to traversing, not descending.
*   **C: Meeshaa ofiin baattachuun gaara ba’uu** (Self-belaying to climb a mountain) - This refers to climbing, the opposite of descending.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""yeroo haala mijataa deemsa milaa irra caalaa fageenya hamma ta’e waliin gahuu ni dandessa.""  This translates to ""When conditions are favorable, it can cover a distance greater than walking."" 

This directly implies that **favorable conditions** allow for greater speed when traveling by donkey.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kophee jabaataa (Strong spur):** While the passage mentions needing a strong spur, it doesn't say it *increases* speed, only that it's needed *after* going off the proper path.
* **B: Mi’a duugdaa ulfaataa (Unpaved road):** The passage explicitly states that traveling on rough roads *decreases* speed (""garuu karaa haramaa irra ba’aa dugdaa ulfaata malee saffisa qaxxaamuraa iskiiyiingii darbee darbee malee hin geessu"").
* **D: Daandii qulqullaa’e (Cleared path):** The passage doesn't mention a cleared path being helpful for speed. It contrasts using the proper path with going off-road.

The passage explicitly states: ""Imaltoonni aadaa haaraa sanatti baruuf itti salphate, yeroo tokko tokko aadaa isaanii isa itti dhalatanitti deebi’anii baruuf addumaan rakkoo guddaa itti ta’a."" This translates to: ""While immigrants easily learn the new culture, they often have great difficulty re-learning the culture they were born into.""

The passage describes the difficulty of re-integrating into one's original culture *after* being exposed to a new one.  This is the core of the ""re-entry shock"" being discussed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aadaa naannoo haaraatti baruudhaan** (By learning the new local culture) - This is the *easy* part, according to the passage, not the solution to the problem.
* **B: Nama hubatuu fi obsa qabu ta’uudhaan** (By being understanding and observant) - While helpful generally, this doesn't address the specific cultural re-learning issue.
* **C: Imala biyya biraa taasisuudhaan** (By adopting the behaviors of another country) - This would exacerbate the problem, not solve it.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that return migrants often struggle to re-adapt to their home culture, *especially* after being exposed to a new one. They may lose aspects of their original culture and find it difficult to reconnect with it.  The text emphasizes the *loss* (""baayee dhabdeeta"") of cultural traits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Imaltoota ariitiidhaan aadaa biyya bakkeetti baraniif** (Individuals who readily learn the culture of the host country) - The passage talks about difficulty *returning*, not ease of adaptation *to* the new culture.
* **C: Imaltoota haga ammaatti yeroo miidhagaa qabaachuu irra jiraniif** (Individuals who still have time for positive adjustment) - The passage doesn’t focus on time for adjustment, but on the challenges faced *after* a long period of absence.
* **D: Imaltoota obsa xiqqoo qabaniif** (Individuals with little awareness) - The passage implies the opposite - these migrants are *aware* of the changes and struggle with the differences.

Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa namoonni gadamsa wajjin maal gochuu hin qabani?,"Correct answer is **B: Suuta itti siquu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yeroo namoonni hantuuta akka balaa fiduttii hin laalle, baay’ee itti siqanii of balaa keessa galchu."" This translates to: ""When people don't perceive danger as a disaster, they often rush towards it and put themselves in harm's way.""

Therefore, the passage specifically warns against *rushing towards* danger (suuta itti siquu).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jiraachuu isaanii ilaalcha keessa galchuu dhiisuu** (Not considering their existence): The passage doesn't address ignoring someone's existence.
*   **C: Carraa balaa uumuu isaanii hir’isuu** (Reducing their ability to create opportunities for disaster): The passage doesn't discuss preventing someone from *causing* disaster.
*   **D: Fageenyarraa isaan ilaaluu** (Looking at them from a distance): This isn’t mentioned as something to avoid in the passage.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yeroo namoonni hantuuta akka balaa fiduttii hin laalle, baay’ee itti siqanii of balaa keessa galchu."" (When people don't see danger as a danger, they frequently approach it and put themselves in danger.) This means people *don't* dare and succeed; they approach and get *into* danger.  It's a negative outcome, not a demonstration of courage or ability to dare successfully.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the passage:

* **A: Uumamaan bineensa hammeenya qabani dha** (They are naturally dangerous creatures) - The passage implies danger by mentioning ""hammeenya"" (danger) and that the creature can defend itself if provoked.
* **B: Al tokko tokko akka balaatti hin ilaalamani** (Some animals are not seen as a danger) -  This is directly stated in the passage: ""Yeroo namoonni hantuuta akka balaa fiduttii hin laalle..."" (When people don't see danger as a danger...)
* **D: Yoo barbaachisaa ta’e ofirraa ni ittisu** (It will defend itself if necessary) - The passage says, ""...garuu yoo hammeenya itti dhufuuf jedhu hubatan of irraa ni ittisu."" (...but if they understand it will be dangerous, it will defend itself.)

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa imaltoota gammoojjii keessaa irratti carraa balaa uumuu gadi aanaa kan qabu isa kami?","Correct answer: **A: Dhabiinsa uffata ho’aa halkan qorraa ta’eef**

Here's why:

The passage states that *not having enough sweat* (uffannaan ho’u hinjiru) can lead to heatstroke (haayipooteermiyaan balaa nama mudachuu danada’udha).  This is a direct and serious risk.

Let's look at why the other options are less dangerous based on the passage:

* **B: Abjuu guyyaa bishaan fakkaatee itti mul’achuu:** This is mentioned as a *symptom* of heat, not a cause of danger itself. The danger comes from the heat and potential dehydration if not addressed.
* **C: Abjuu guyyaa arguudhaaf annisaa qisaasessuu:**  While the passage warns about wasting valuable resources like water, simply *seeing* a mirage doesn't inherently cause harm.
* **D: Abjuu guyyaa arguudhaaf bishaan qisaasessuu:** This is specifically mentioned as a *dangerous* action that exacerbates the problem (wasting water needed for survival). But it's the *action* of wasting water that's the risk, not the mirage itself.

Therefore, the lack of sweat (and thus, the inability to cool down) is the most direct and significant risk factor described in the passage.
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu imaltoota gammoojiidhaaf akka balaatti hin tarreeffamne?,"Correct answer is **B: Abjuu guyyaa**.

Here's why:

The passage describes situations where heat exhaustion or heat stroke can occur (feeling dizzy, seeing mirages, etc.). It states these are *symptoms* of heat-related illness, not the illness itself. The passage specifically warns about dangers like dehydration, heatstroke (hypothermia is the opposite of heatstroke - so is not a danger mentioned) and the deadly consequences of them. Mirages (abjuu guyyaa) are a *symptom* experienced when someone is severely dehydrated or overheating - it isn't the harmful condition itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hanqina bishaanii (Dehydration):**  The passage specifically mentions dehydration as a dangerous consequence of heat exposure, leading to more serious problems.
*   **C: Haayipooteermiyaa (Hypothermia):** The passage explicitly states hypothermia is a dangerous consequence of being in extreme heat.
*   **D: Gubaatii aduu (Burns):** While not directly stated, extreme heat can obviously cause burns, making it a danger."
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, gartuu uummataa kamtu dhufaatii imaltootaatiin booda dhiibbaan cimaan irra ga’e?","The correct answer is **C: Tayinoota**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that after the arrival of European colonizers, the Taíno people were greatly diminished by the Spanish. It even provides a statistic from Fray Bartolome de las Casas stating approximately 100,000 Taínos were killed between 1492 and 1498.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Haayitii:** The passage mentions Haiti as sharing the island with the Dominican Republic, but doesn't indicate the people of Haiti suffered the most immediately after colonization.
*   **B: Caribes:** While the passage mentions the Carib people lived there before, the focus of the devastating impact is on the Taínos.
*   **D: Hispaaniyoolaa:** The Spanish *caused* the harm, they didn't *suffer* from it according to the text.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Afaan kamtu warra caribe ta’aniin dubbatama ture?","Correct answer is **D: Arawaak**.

The text states: ""Gosi Caribe kun namoota afaan Arawaak dubbatan, kanneen dhaloota Kiristoos dura bara 10,000 keessa achi qubatan turan."" (The Caribe people spoke the Arawaak language, who settled there around 10,000 years before the birth of Christ.)"
Tapha skiing akka tapha bashannanaatti beeksisuu keessatti eenyutu beekamtii isaa fudhata?,"Correct answer: **B: Noorweeyii**

Here's why:

The text states: ""bara 1861 gareen bashannanaa sikaayi kileb jedhamu warra Noorweeyiin Awustiraaliyaa keessatti hundaaye."" This directly indicates that the Norwegian people were instrumental in founding the skiing sport as a competitive activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Iskii baamsi:** ""Iskii baamsi"" refers to people who enjoy skiing, not those who popularized it as a sport.
*   **C: Holqa keessa jiraattota:** The text mentions photos *of* people skiing, but doesn't say they were the ones who established the sport.
*   **D: Awustiraaliyaa:** While the group was founded *in* Australia, it was a Norwegian group that did the founding."
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, bara kam keessa yeroo jalqabaatiif skiingiin akka Ispoortiitti beekame?","The correct answer is **D: Jaarraa 17ffaa**.

The text states: ""Gosni Ispoortii gaararraa dachaatti konkolaachuu gosa ispoortii deebi’e kan ta’e jaarraa17ffaa keessa ture..."" which translates to ""This unique sport of gliding down hills was a revived sport in the 17th century..."" 

Therefore, skiing became known as a sport for the first time in the 17th century."
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu addatti odola guddaa Afriikaa Bahaatii wajjin wal-qabata?,"Correct answer is **A: Dhiibbaa Awurooppaanotaa**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that European colonization of the Oddolowwan Afriikaa Bahaa Garba Indiyaa began in the 15th century with Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama. This colonization significantly impacted the region, making ""Dhiibbaa Awurooppaanotaa"" (European influence/colonization) the most directly related topic.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Amantaa Islaamaa** - While the text mentions the spread of Islam, it's presented as something that *happened* in the region, not a defining characteristic of the Oddolowwan Afriikaa Bahaa Garba Indiyaa itself.
*   **C: Bineensota bosonaa** - The text briefly mentions that smaller groups of people from these areas could travel to or be found in other countries, but it's not a central focus.
*   **D: Bakka bashannanaa qaqqaalii** - The text mentions these places, but they're described as features *within* the region, not something fundamentally defining it.



"
Kamtu amala odola xiqqaa Afriikaa Bahaa miti? ,"The correct answer is **D: birmadummaa uummattoota kan biroo irraa** (being enslaved by other peoples).

Here's why:

*   **The passage mentions colonization by Europeans starting in the 15th century.** This implies the people of the Comoros and Mayotte *were* subjected to enslavement and control by others. However, the text doesn't mention them enslaving *other* peoples.

Let's look at why the other options are *in* the passage:

*   **A: Faransayi wajjin wal-quunnamuu** (Association with France) - The text says ""akkasumas bakka baashannanaa qaqqaalii qarqara bishaanii jedhamani beekamu. Araboonnis amantaa Islaamaa gara biyyichaatti fidaniiru, innis Koomooroosii fi Maayootii keessatti baay’inaan fudhatame."" This implies a historical connection, including influence and potentially association with France.
*   **B: Bakka bashannanaa qaqqaalii hedduu** (Many secluded bathing places) - The passage explicitly states ""akkaasumas bakka baashannanaa qaqqaalii qarqara bishaanii jedhamani beekamu.""
*   **C: Beekamtii sababa bineensota bosonaaf** (Recognition due to forest bees) - The passage states ""yeroo bineensota bosonaatiin ilaalamu Oddolawwan xixiqqoon bay’een isaani biyyoota of danda’oodha.""



Therefore, being enslavers of other peoples is not a characteristic described in the passage regarding the small islands of the Indian Ocean."
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, ayyaanni duaa ka’uu akkamitti manneen amantaa aadaa adda ta’an muraasaan kabajama?","The correct answer is **B: Dammaqinaan Sanbata galgala qopheessuu**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Manneen kiristaanaa warri baayyee duudhaa eeggatan, yeroo baayyee galgala Sambata duraa dhuma-torbanii yeroo Du’aa ka’uutti sirna Dammaqanii eeggachuu du’aa ka’uu geggeessu...""  This directly translates to Christian homes often prepare for the remembrance of the resurrection by observing a Lent-like preparation period on the Saturday before Easter Sunday.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sirna wal-hormaataa qabaachuudhaan** (Having a common practice) - While true, the passage doesn’t highlight a *specific* common practice as the defining way different denominations observe the event.
*   **C: Walitti qabamichaaf kabaja waqtii birraa qopheessuu** (Preparing a time of reverence for communion) - The passage mentions communion (Du'aa ka'uu) but doesn't emphasize *preparing time* for it as the differentiating factor.
*   **D: Aduun ba’uu ilaaluu** (Considering the world leaving) - This isn't mentioned in the passage at all.



"
Ulaagaa yeroo Ikkuwaador seenan barbaachisu hambisuudhaaf Lammiileen Kuubaa jalqaba maal qabaachuu qabu?,"The correct answer is **B: Xalayaa affeerraa seera qabeessa ta’e** (A valid exit permit).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Lammiileen Kuubaa...Ikuwaadooriin seenuun dura xalayaa afeerraa fudhachuu isaan irraa eegdi."" (Cuban citizens...are required to obtain an exit permit before entering Ecuador).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Paaspoortii yeroo imalaa booddee ji’a 6 tajaajiluu danda’u** (Passport valid for at least 6 months) - While the text *mentions* passport validity, it's not the *first* thing they need.
*   **C: Tikkeetii yeroo deebi’uu turtii isaanii mirkaneessuuf** (Return ticket to prove their stay) - This is also mentioned, but not the primary initial requirement.
*   **D: Giriin Kaardii Yunaayitid Isteetsii** (US Green Card) - The text specifies this is an exception *from* the rule, not a requirement.  Those with US Green Cards are exempt from the permit.



"
Ulaagaan imalaa Ikkuwaadoor maal fa’iif hin kalaqamne?,"The correct answer is **B: Sosochii godaantotaa haala qindaa’aa ta’een tursuuf** (To prevent irregular migratory flows).

Here's why:

The passage states the rule was implemented ""to create irregular migratory flows between the two countries"" (gidduutti sochii godaansaa qindaa’aa ta’e uumuufidha). This directly links the regulation to controlling or preventing illegal/irregular migration.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lakkoofsa imaltootaa gadi qabuuf** (To reduce the number of immigrants) - While it *might* reduce numbers, the passage doesn't explicitly state that's the primary goal.
*   **C: Turtii imaltootaa mirkaneessuuf** (To verify the resources of immigrants) - The passage mentions needing proof of a return ticket, but that's only *part* of the overall reason.
*   **D: Fudhatamummaa paaspoortii mirkaneessuuf** (To verify passport validity) -  Passport validity is a requirement, but again, it’s a component of controlling migration rather than the main reason.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu biyya ofii caalaa biyya bakkeetti gatii olaanaa nama baasisuu danda’a?,"The correct answer is **B: Fireemiiwwan mi’aawoo (Foreign/Imported Goods)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Fireemiiwwan maqaa biraandii fi mi’aawoon naannoo kanatti argaman rakkoolee lama qabaachuu danda’u ; tokko waraabbii ta’uu danda’a, kanneen dhugaamatti alaa galfaman immoo isa biyya keessaa caalaa qaalii ta’uu malu."" This translates to: ""Imported branded goods and imported goods in this area may have two problems; one is counterfeiting, and those genuinely imported are more expensive than those produced domestically.""

Therefore, imported goods (mi’aawoon) are identified as being potentially more expensive than domestic products, making them more costly to obtain from another country.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Qorannoo ijaa (Eye examination):** The text only mentions eye exams as a possible cost, not as a factor that *increases* cost when going abroad.
*   **C: Inshuraansii Ijaa (Eye insurance):** Same as above, insurance is a potential cost, not a driver of higher costs for foreign travel.
*   **D: Firremiiwwan maqaa biraandii hin taanee (Non-branded goods):** While branded goods are mentioned, the text specifically highlights *imported* goods as being potentially expensive.



"
Biyya bakkee keessatti maaltu carraa fireemii gatii qaalii ta’ee bituu uumuu danda’a?,"Correct answer: **C: Gowwomsaa ta’uu danda’u**

Here's why:

The passage states that imported goods (like premiums from foreign manufacturers) can be more expensive because they might be subject to tariffs (""warabbii""). This means customs duties increase the cost, making them more expensive to buy in the local market.  ""Gowwomsaa"" translates to customs or tariffs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Qorannoon ijaa dabalataa ta’e barbaachisuu danda’a (Additional visual inspection may be required):** While inspection might be a part of import processes, it doesn't *create* the opportunity for a higher price.
*   **B: Ajajichi fireemota muraasaaf fudhatamaa ta’uu dhiisuu mala (The approval process may not be suitable for some premiums):** This speaks to regulations, not cost.
*   **D: Inshuraansiin gatii isaa cufuu hin danda’u ta’a (Insurance cannot cover its cost):** This is unrelated to why premiums might be expensive due to import.

Here's why:

*   The text states ""Paawundiin Ingilizii akka waligalaatti oddoolawwan keessaa bakka kamittuu fudhatama qaba"" which translates to ""The British pound is accepted everywhere as the most preferred currency.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text says credit cards and US dollars are *often* accepted in Stanley, but acceptance of foreign cards outside of Stanley is unreliable.
*   **B:** While Stanley accepts US dollars, it is not the *only* place. The text implies this is a specific location for US dollar acceptance.
*   **C:** The text states that Falkland Islands currency can only be exchanged at the Bank of Iceland branch in Stanley and the FIC bureau de change, so it is not freely interchangeable.

The text states: ""Oddolawwan fagoo keessatti tarii kaardiin liqaa fudhatamuu dhiisuu mala, yooma mallaqni Ingilizii fi Yuunaayitid Isteetsi fudhatamuu malan illee..."" This means that credit cards might not be accepted in remote areas, but British and US currency *are* potentially accepted. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: FIC kuusaa dhihaa** - FIC is a specific location for currency exchange, not a general method of payment.
*   **B: Odoloota mara keessatti** - The text specifically mentions potential issues with credit card acceptance in some areas.
*   **D: Guutummaa Istanli keessatti** - Stanley is where currency exchange happens, but the question asks where US currency is accepted *in general* on the Falkland Islands.



"
Sagantaa isa kamtu kabaja feestivaalii mana amantaa wajjin wal hin qabatu?,"The correct answer is **A: Dhaloota Arbaa (Thursday Birthdays)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the festivals involve honoring deities, celebrating the new year, and special religious observances *related to the temple*. It specifically mentions honoring birthdays *as part of religious celebrations* or unique temple-related events.  

""Kabaja ayyaana hundeeffama mana qulqullummichaa"" (honoring the founding day of the temple), ""Kabaja aguyyaa dhalootaa"" (honoring birthdays - within the religious context), and ""Sagantaalee murteessoo mana qulqullummicha hirmaachisan"" (participating in important temple events) all directly relate to temple festivals and religious practices.

Celebrating a birthday simply being on a Thursday (""Dhaloota Arbaa"") is not mentioned as part of the religious festivities and seems to be a regular occurrence, not a specifically honored one within the temple context.



"
Arboonni miidhegfaman eessatti argamuu danda’u?,"The correct answer is **D: Karaawwan Keraalaa irratti**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ayyaanni mana amantaa Keeraalaa ilaaluudhaaf baay’ee hawwataadha, agarsiisa dhaabbataa arba miidhagfamee, baandii mana amantaa fi ayyaanota biroottin midhagfamerea"" which translates to ""The Keerala religious festivals are very attractive, showing a decorated statue, decorated with temple bands and other festivals."" This directly implies the decorated items (including the *miidhagfaman* - decorated things) are found **on the roads of Kerala**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text states the festivals happen from late September to October, not late August to September.
*   **B:** While temples are involved, the text doesn’t say the decorated items *are* in the temple itself, only that they are part of the festival.
*   **C:** This is not mentioned in the text.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, kanneen armaan gadii keessa malli kaffaltii balalii Biizinasii yookaan kutaa jalqabaaqusachuuf carraa olaanaa qabu isa kami?","The correct answer is **A: Karaa dhaabbata kee kaffaluu** (Paying through your organization).

Here's why:

The passage states that companies are often willing to pay the high costs (four times the standard fare plus an additional 60%) to get upgrades. It emphasizes that only a small group of people who are willing to pay a large amount of money directly can achieve this. Therefore, going *through* your organization is the method with the highest chance of success, as they are the ones likely to absorb the high costs.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Bakka tikeetii biizinasii kankutaa jalqabaa kutachuu** (Trying to secure a business class ticket from the beginning): The passage implies this is expensive and difficult.
* **C: Tikeetii sadarkaa tokkoffaa al-kallattii kutachuu** (Purchasing a first-class ticket on a partner airline): This isn't directly addressed in the text.  While potentially an option, it's not highlighted as a higher-probability method.
* **D: Gatii gadi-bu’aa barbaaduu** (Looking for a discounted fare): The passage explicitly says this is *not* effective (""...gatii gadi bu’aan barbaadamuuf hinjiru"").

**Explanation:**

The passage clearly states that moving from stage A to stage B (presumably different levels of investment or business development) requires significant financial investment, specifically ""four times the cost of its previous stage, and also one and a half times the cost of the initial stage."" This highlights a *cost escalation* or *balali’iinsa kallattii* as the primary factor influencing the decision-making process for those willing to pay for speed and access.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kutaa biizinasii (Business Class):** While mentioned, it's a *location* where the cost escalation happens, not the reason for consideration.
*   **C: gatii gadi-bu’aa (Price reduction):** The passage explicitly states there's *not* a price reduction; it's the opposite—increased cost.
*   **D: Kutaa jalqabaa (Initial Stage):** This is a reference point for cost comparison but not the core issue driving the decision."

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Kaffaltii dabalataa viizaaf dabaluu hin dagatinaa, qaraxa biyya-dhiisanii deemuu, geejjiiba lafaa fi kan kana fakkaatan. Bakkeewwan hundaa Afrikaa ala ta'aan sanaaf."" (You must not avoid additional visa fees, departure taxes, ground handling fees and the like. For all destinations outside of Africa).

This directly indicates that additional visa fees for non-African destinations are *not* included when comparing the total cost of travel with global agreements.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: KaffaltiiTaaksii biyya gadhiisuu Afriikaa keessaa** - The passage doesn't mention taxes within Africa being an issue in the comparison.
*   **C: Kaffaltii Viizaa Afriikaa** - The passage focuses on fees for destinations *outside* Africa.
*   **D: Kaffaltii geejjiba bu’uuraa bakkeewwan Afriikaan alaaf** - While ground handling fees are mentioned, the core issue is the visa fees.

**Explanation:**

The passage states: ""Suppermaarkeetiiwwan kutaa nyaata qophaa’aa caalmaatti adda adda ta’e argataa jiraachuun isaanii daddabalaa dhufeera."" This translates to ""Supermarkets are increasingly found to have a variety of ready-to-eat food sections."" This directly indicates that the availability of ready-to-eat food is the primary factor driving supermarkets to offer more choices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bilcheessituu Maayikirooweevii (Microwave ovens):** While some supermarkets *have* microwaves, the passage doesn't state that this is the reason for offering more choices. It's a consequence of the ready-to-eat food, not the cause.
*   **C: Mana nyaataa bakka hojiirra (Food stalls):** These are mentioned as existing in some places, but they're presented as an alternative to supermarkets, not as something supermarkets are *becoming* because of offering more choices.
*   **D: Gatii madaalawaa (Low prices):** Price is not mentioned as a driving factor for supermarkets expanding their food options.

Here's why:

The passage states that some supermarkets offer microwaves or other heating devices. This directly facilitates customers buying pre-prepared food because they can immediately heat and eat it. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mana nyaataa bakka hojiirra:** The passage describes these as often unregulated and expensive, not something a supermarket would *encourage* for customer convenience.
*   **B: Filannoo gosa muraasa:** While variety is mentioned, it doesn't specifically *help* customers buy pre-prepared food.
*   **C: Nyaata hin bilchaanne:** This is a characteristic of the food, not a service provided by the supermarket.

Here's why:

The passage states that Belgian and Swiss French have ""small differences in vocabulary"" (sagaleessi jechoota muraasaas xiqqoo isii garaagara). This means using words unique to standard French (France) could lead to misunderstanding.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **C: Akkaataa sagaleessuu jechoota Faransaayii tokko tokko** - While pronunciation *can* vary, the passage doesn't suggest this is a major barrier to understanding.
*   **D: Harka caalaa afaan Faransaay Faransaayi keessatti dubbataman** - This isn't a specific linguistic feature that would cause confusion; it's more about frequency of use.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland is *slightly* different in pronunciation (sagaleessi jechoota muraasaas xiqqoo isii garaagara) from standard French. However, it also says these differences are small enough for mutual understanding. It doesn't say the pronunciation of *all* words is different, just some.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **C: Afaan waaltawaa Faransaayi mana barnootaatti barsiifamu** (Standard French taught in schools) - The passage says both Swiss and Belgians learn standard French in school.
*   **D: Qubeessuu jechoota Faransaayi muraasa** (The construction of some French words) - This refers to the slight differences in vocabulary mentioned in the passage.

Here's why:

The passage states that you *must* book directly through the airline's phone line to get the reduced fare for bereaved families. It specifically mentions airlines like Air Canada, Delta, Lufthansa, United/Canada and WestJet. It implies that booking through a third-party service will *prevent* you from accessing this benefit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yoo WestJetiin kan balaliitu ta’e** - WestJet *is* one of the airlines that offers the benefit.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the fee is lowered for those whose loved ones have died, but it's done through a ""last-minute change fee waiver."" This means the fee is *reduced* within a *short timeframe* (last minute).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kaffaltii geejjiba awwaalchaa cufuufi** - The passage doesn't mention a general grief change fee waiver. It's specifically tied to a recent loss.
* **B: Marsaariitii daandii qilleensaa irratti kallattiidhaan galmaa’uu qabu** - The passage mentions contacting the airline, but not that you *must* do so in person at the airport.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yeroo qarshii qusachuu yaaltu** (When you're trying to save money) - The passage says GPS on a smartphone is *cheaper* than buying a dedicated GPS device or maps.
* **B: Yeroo akka deetaa qunnamsiisu argattu beektu** (When you know you have data) -  If you have data, phone GPS is perfectly adequate.
* **D: Yeroo meeshaa kireeffachuu hin barbaanne** (When you don't want to rent a device) - The passage doesn't focus on renting; it's about the functionality in different situations.



"
"Maaltu mosaajii GPS, Meeshaa tajaajila GPS kennu caalaatti akka fayyadamamuuf sababa gaarii miti?","The correct answer is **A: Yaaddoon tajaajila intarneetii waan hin barbaachifneef** (Because it doesn't require an internet connection).

Here's why:

* **The passage highlights GPS as being useful *especially* when you don't have data.** It specifically mentions situations where your phone has no data (""Yoo bilbili kee deetaa qunnamsiisu hin qabu tahe yookin yoo sararaan ala ta’e""). This is a major advantage over relying on internet-based map services.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Qarshii qusachuu (Saving money):** While the passage *mentions* saving money on maps/rentals, it isn't the *primary* reason GPS is better than other services.
* **C: Kiraa hambisuu (Reducing rentals):** The passage mentions potentially avoiding rental cars, but this is a benefit, not a fundamental reason GPS is superior.
* **D: Kaartaa haaraa bituun barbaachisuu diisuu (Not needing to buy new maps):**  Similar to B & C, it's a benefit, but not the core reason.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, doonii mijatu irra akka si ga’e maaliin mirkaneeffatta?","The correct answer is **C: Bakka bu’aa imala Gaalaapaagoos irratti muuxannoo qabu biratti galmaa’uu.**

Here's why:

The passage states the individual became knowledgeable about the Galapagos and had extensive experience with boats.  It then links this expertise to being able to find the best spots (the ""bakka bu'aa"") that others haven't discovered yet. This directly implies that experience and knowledge of the Galapagos are key to finding the best fishing locations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** Sharing a similar preference with 8+ people doesn't guarantee finding the *best* spot.
*   **B:** Being quick to get a spot doesn't mean it's a good spot, just that you were first.
*   **D:**  Being there early is a tactic, but the passage emphasizes *knowing where* to go, not just *when*.



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu mala ittiin keessummaa qumaara irra tursanii miti?","Correct answer is **B: Tikeetii tolaa koonsartiidhaan hamileessuu**.

Here's why:

The passage describes casinos using tactics like extending gambling time, offering free drinks and meals, and creating a comfortable environment to encourage people to gamble more. 

*   **A: Ifa uumamaa baay’isuu (Increasing the atmosphere)** - The passage mentions creating a pleasant atmosphere with meals and drinks, implying an attempt to make the casino more appealing.
*   **C: Dhugaatii dabalataa (Extra drinks)** - The passage explicitly states casinos offer free or readily available alcohol.
*   **D: Dhabamuu sa’aatii (Loss of time)** - The passage says casinos try to extend gambling time.
*   **B: Tikeetii tolaa koonsartiidhaan hamileessuu (Giving out free concert tickets)** - This is not mentioned anywhere in the passage. The tactics described are all directly related to making people stay and gamble longer *within* the casino, not offering entertainment outside of it.

Therefore, offering free concert tickets is the method *not* described as a way casinos use to encourage gambling."
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, namni qaxalee qumaara taphatu maal hambisuu qaba?","Correct answer: **A: Alkoolii humnaan olii dhuguu**

Here's why:

The passage states ""Bakki baayeen dhugaati alkooli manatti dhi’eessu. Garuu, dhugduu ta’uun murtoo ofiitiin dha, akkasuma warreen quumara taphataan kunuunsaan akka turtuu godhu."" (Many places serve alcoholic beverages. However, drinking is a personal choice, and those who gamble should avoid getting drunk.) This directly warns against excessive alcohol consumption while gambling.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hamileessa kamiyyuu simachuu (Ignoring all losses):** The passage doesn't mention ignoring losses, but rather the difficulty and cost of winning.
* **C: Sa’atii ilaaluu (Watching the time):** While the passage mentions time passing quickly, it doesn't suggest that watching the time is the key thing to avoid.
* **D: Karaa b’umsaa dhihoo ta’e gaafachuu (Asking for an easy way to win):**  The passage implies winning is *difficult* and not easily attained, not that one should actively seek an easy win.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, kutaa haasaa kamtu walakkaa himaatti qubee guddaadhaan barreeffama?","Correct answer: **A: xumura**

**Explanation:**

The passage states: ""Kun mala gaariidha. Dubbisa salphisa jedhamees ni falmama, yooma barreessuun xumurri yookaan maqibsiin bifa qabiyyee qabuun fayyadamamuu fi dhiisuu isaa adda baafachuu barbaacha irraa kan ka’e walxaxaa ta’e illee.""

This directly refers to using *xumura* (conclusions) to distinguish between different sections and make reading easier. The passage highlights that marking conclusions distinctly is a good practice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Maqaalee (Titles):** While titles are important, the passage doesn't focus on them being used for distinct marking in the way it does with conclusions.
*   **C: Maqibsaa (Abstracts):** Abstracts are summaries, not necessarily used to divide sections.
*   **D: Antima (Antonyms):** Antonyms have no connection to marking sections of a text."
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, maqoota qubee guddaadhaan barreessuun maaltu akka ciman taasisa?","Correct answer is **B: Xumura adda baasuu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that using initial capitalization (like with ""Saayi"" in the text) is a good way to **distinguish nouns and proper nouns** (xumurootaa fi antimoota adda baasuuf).  The rest of the options are related to writing or reading but aren't the *direct* purpose of the capitalization method described in the passage.



"
"Kutaa baadiyyaa Maaleezhiyaa keessatti, malattoo isa kamtu “as kottu “ jechuutti hiikama?","Correct answer: **A: Quba agarsiistuu ofitti dabsuu**

The passage states that in rural Malaysia, ""as kottu"" refers to ""absorbing the shame/blame onto oneself,"" which is beneficial in certain traditional contexts. This directly translates to showing humility and taking responsibility. Therefore, option A is the most accurate representation of the meaning of ""as kottu"" in that context.



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, malattoo isa kamtu “deebi’ii kottu” jechuutti hiikama?","Correct answer is **B: Quba agarsiistuu ofitti dabsuu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that in Malaysia, ""as kottu"" (the equivalent of a handshake) involves *drawing the hand back after touching it*, signifying a withdrawal or holding back. This is described as showing respect and is only for that specific purpose. This aligns directly with the description of ""quba agarsiistuu ofitti dabsuu"" (withdrawing a gesture of respect).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Barruu ofitti galagalchanii raasuu** (Reaching out and touching oneself) - The passage doesn't mention anything about touching oneself.
*   **C: Barruu achi galagalchanii raasuu** (Reaching out and touching another) - This describes a standard handshake, the passage emphasizes the difference in Malaysia.
*   **D: Mataa raasuu** (Rubbing the forehead) - This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, maaltu hallayyaa cabbii gidduutti uuma?","The correct answer is **A: Riqicha cabbii (Cabbi's revenge)**.

Here's why:

The passage repeatedly emphasizes the danger and consequences stemming from *riqicha cabbii* (cabbi's revenge). It describes how it can cause suffering (baqaquu), speechlessness (cabbii afaan banaa), suffocation (qaqqabsisuu), and even death (dhokachuu). The whole passage revolves around the fear and effects of this ""revenge.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sigigaachuu cabbii (Cabbi's sickness):** While the passage mentions ""sigigaachoon cabbii,"" it's presented as a *symptom* or a starting point, not the core source of the problem. It's the revenge that causes the real harm.
* **C: Kufuu holqa cabbii (Cabbi's empty breath):** This refers to the hollowness and weakness associated with the sickness, but again, it's a consequence, not the cause.
* **D: Andara cabbii sigigaatu (The scent of sick cabbi):**  The scent is a warning sign, but it's the *revenge* associated with the sickness that is the true danger.



Therefore, **riqicha cabbii** is the central force creating turmoil within the cabbi community according to the passage."
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, kanneen keessaa kamtu riqicha cabbiitiin dhokachuu danda’a?","The correct answer is **A: Baqaqaa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...baqaquu, cabbii afaan banaa, qaqqabsisuu danda’aa, kan riqicha cabbiitiin dhokachuu danda’u.""  This directly translates to: ""...baqaquu (stones), can speak with the mouth of a lion, can be absorbed, and can deceive with the charm of a lion.""

Therefore, *baqaquu* (stones) are the ones explicitly mentioned as being able to deceive with the charm of a lion (riqicha cabbiitiin dhokachuu danda’u).

The text states: ""hayyami baadiyyaa jiraattota muraasa qabuu, kan Caamsaa keessaa guyyaa itti jalqaban kamiiyyuu Amajjii 1 dhiyeeffama."" This directly translates to ""Permits for backcountry visitors starting any day in November are released on September 1."" 

Therefore, the backcountry permits can be started on September 1st."
Imaammata kamtu canyon kunuunsa?,"Correct answer: **A: Sirna eeyyamaa Kan dura dhufe dura keessummeeffama jedhu**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Eyyamaa murtaa’etu jira kan namaa duraa dhufeef kennamu seera kan duraa dhufee, duraa tajaajilamaa jedhuun."" This translates to ""There is a priority permit given to the first person to arrive, following the principle of first come, first served.""
*   This principle of ""first come, first served"" is the core of the Grand Canyon's permit system as described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Eeyyamni kan danda’amu Fulbaana 1 irratti dha** (Permits can be obtained on February 1st) - The passage mentions applications being available months in advance, not a fixed date like February 1st.
*   **C: Eeyyamni kan argamuu danda’u gaaffii deemuun dhiyeessuudhaani** (Permits can be obtained by submitting a request) - While submitting an application is part of the process, it doesn't define the *principle* behind the system.
*   **D: Lakkoofsa eeyyamaa murtaa’e** (A defined permit number) - The passage doesn't focus on the *number* of permits, but *how* they are allocated.

Kanneen arman gadii keessaa gosoota hoteelotaa kuticha keessatti ibsaman keessatti carraan argamuu isaa gadi aanaa ta’e kami?,"Correct answer: **D: Kutaalee yeroo dhiyootti haaromfaman**

Here's why:

The passage describes hotels that are often dilapidated, with fading grandeur (""faashinii moofaan,"" ""hanqinni gaarummaa"").  The phrase ""dullumni simbo qabeessi"" (a dull, simple appearance) further supports this.  Therefore, hotels in this description are *unlikely* to have recently renovated sections.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Mana dhugaatii kookteelii:** These hotels catered to the wealthy and famous, so a cocktail lounge is very plausible.
*   **B: Bakka mana nyaataatti Ogeessa Nyaata dhandhamuu:** High-end hotels would often have excellent dining options and potentially showcase skilled chefs.
*   **C: Keessummoota biroo sirriitti beekamoo ta’an yookiin baramuu danda’an:**  The passage states they hosted notable and prominent figures, suggesting well-known guests.



"
"Odeeffannoo kuticha keessatti dhiyaatan irratti hundaa’uun, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa keessummootni hoteelaa carraa kennamu kamiif dursa laachuu dhiisuu danda’u?","Correct answer: **D: Kaffaltii kutaalee gatii madaalawaan**

Here's why:

The passage states the hotels often had ""irbaata fi jiruu galgalaa gaarii qabaatu"" (good evening meals and lodging) and that they catered to the wealthy (""maallaqa tuullaa qabu balali’a addunyaa gutuu"").  Offering installments or credit (""kaffaltii kutaalee gatii madaalawaan"") would have been *less* likely for hotels catering to a wealthy clientele who could likely pay upfront.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely to be something a high-end hotel would *refuse* to offer:

*   **A: Qabeenyichii meeshaalee moofaa gatii jabeessaan guutamuu** - (Furnishing with expensive, high-quality furniture) This aligns with the description of the hotels being luxurious and catering to the wealthy.
*   **B: Mana nyaataa Ogeessa nyaata qopheessuu addatti qabu** - (Having a master chef to prepare meals)  Again, this fits with the hotel's high-end nature and providing good food.
*   **C: Bakka bashannanaa bohaartii galgalaa dhiyeessu** - (Providing a dance hall for evening entertainment) Hotels of that era often offered entertainment to attract guests.



Therefore, offering payment plans would be the least likely accommodation for the described hotels."
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Imaltoonni Giriinlaandiin daawwatan maal dhiisuu qabu?","The correct answer is **B: Haalli qilleensichaa waggaa guutuu ho’aa waan ta’eef, uffata furdaa fiduu** (Bring warm clothes as the climate is cold year-round).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Waqtii qorraa keessa Giriinlaandiin yoo daawatte (gara kaabaatti akka fagaattee deemtuun, daran qorra), uffannaa sirriitti ho’u qabachuun murteessaadha."" (If you visit Greenland in the winter (the further north you go, the colder it is), bringing warm clothes is essential.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Naannoowwan muraasa yakki heddumminaan itti raawwataman** (Areas with high crime rates) - The passage states ""Magaalota keessattillee, """"naannoleen rakkisoon"""" hin jiran."" (Even in cities, there are no ""dangerous neighborhoods"").

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa imaltoot osoo itti hin qophaa’iin Giriinlaandiin daawwachuu deemaniif Rakkoo ta’uu kan danda’u kami?","The correct answer is **C: Haala qilleensaa (Climate conditions)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Halli qilleensaa qorraan tarii balaa sirrii isa tokkicha nama hin qophoofne mudatudha."" (The cold climate is a real danger that one cannot underestimate.) It further elaborates on the dangers of the long dark winters (lack of sunlight) and the importance of proper clothing when visiting during the cold season.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Busaa Noordiikii (Nordic lights):** The passage mentions Nordic lights, but only in the context of wintertime - it doesn't state they *cause* problems for visitors.
*   **B: Yakka (Crime):** The passage states that crime is not common even in cities (""naannoleen rakkisoon"""" hin jiran"").
*   **D: Namoota naannoo (Local people):** The passage doesn't indicate any issues with locals causing problems for visitors.

Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu yeroo ammaa akka galama gabaa giddu-galeessaatti tajaajila?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

The text states: ""Amma akka walakkeessa Plazaati tajaajilaa, fi yeroo hundumaa waan adeemu qabaa, guyyaa fi galgalaa."" This translates to ""Now it serves as a central Plaza meeting place, and is always available, day and night.""  This directly indicates Jardín de la Unión functions as a central gathering place.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: The Alley of the Kiss (Callejon del Beso):** The text describes this as a specific location *within* the Jardín de la Unión, a narrow balcony. It's not the plaza itself.
* **C: Templo de San Diego:** The text states this was *built within* the garden, but only its construction remains. It doesn't serve as a current meeting place.
* **D: Callejon del Beso:** This is the Spanish name for ""The Alley of the Kiss,"" and suffers from the same issue as option B. It's a specific spot *within* the garden, not the garden itself.



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu Jardín de la Unión keessatti hinargamu?","Correct answer is **D: Gamoo mana amantaa durii**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the *only* part of the original 17th-century project that remains is the construction of the **Templo de San Diego** (San Diego Temple).  It doesn't say the temple *itself* is currently there, only that the *construction* of it was part of the original plan and survived. This implies the temple itself is not currently part of the Jardín de la Unión.

The passage explicitly mentions:

*   **A: Walakkeessa gazebo koonsartootaa wajjin** (Concerts at the gazebo)
*   **B: Mana seenaa jaalalaa durii** (Historic love hotel)
*   **C: Mana nyaataa gara bakka magariisaatti fuulleffatan** (Restaurants near the square)

Therefore, D is the only option that is *not* something you'll find in Jardín de la Unión according to the text."

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Maatiiwwan ijoollee xixiqqoo qaban qophii dabalataa barbaaduu danda’u, garuu guyyaa bakkeetti dabarsuun salphaadhumatti mucoolii fi ijoollota oolmaa daa’immanii jiran waliiniyyuu ni danda’ama.""  This means families *can* participate, even with young children, although they might need extra preparation.  Therefore, it's *not* true that it's not suitable for families with young children.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A:** ""Haayikingii guyyaa faana salphaa ta’eef qophii muraasatu barbaachisa"" - The passage says ""yaalii utaalcha cabbii irraa guyyaadhaf qophiin muraasni barbaachisaa dha"" (some preparation is needed for a day hike).
*   **B:** ""Fageenyi garaagara, garuu guyyaa guutuu tokko keessatti xumurama"" - The passage says, ""Guyyaan tabba yaabun maayila walakka gadii kaasee hamma fageenya dheeratti guyyya tokko keessatti waliin gahuu hirmaachisa"" (A day hike can cover distances from a few miles to longer distances within a single day).
*   **C:** ""Namoonni haala qaamaa giddu galeessa irra jiran taatee kanatti bashannanuu danda’u"" - The passage states, ""namni ga’aan kamiyuu itti bashanaanu danda’a"" (anyone can participate).



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Haayikingii guyyaa yoom qophii baay’ee xiqqaa barbaada?","Correct answer: **A: Namni deemu yommuu haala qaamaa gaarii irra jiraatu**

Here's why:

The text states: ""...*namni ga’aan kamiyuu itti bashanaanu danda’a*. Maatiiwwan ijoollee xixiqqoo qaban qophii dabalataa barbaaduu danda’u, garuu guyyaa bakkeetti dabarsuun salphaadhumatti mucoolii fi ijoollota oolmaa daa’immanii jiran waliiniyyuu ni danda’ama.""

This means anyone can participate, and families with young children only need minimal preparation if they're staying close to the starting point.  **Good physical condition (haala qaamaa gaarii) means you need less preparation** because you can handle the distance more easily.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Faana slaphaa yommuu of keessatti qabaatu:** Having a good spirit isn't directly related to *physical preparation*.
* **C: Ijoollonni yommuu haayikingicha keessa jiraatan:**  The presence of children actually *increases* the preparation needed, not decreases it.
* **D: Deemsichi yommuu caalaatti haala uumamaa keessa jiraatu:** The terrain affects the *difficulty* of the hike, not the amount of preparation needed by the individual.

Here's why:

* The text specifically states that in Rogaland and Agder, these areas are often called ""hei"" which means they are *often protected by heather*. This directly relates to being covered/protected by heather (heezariin).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mukkeen qabu** - The text says ""vidde"" is land *without* trees (muka hin qabne).
* **B: Sululli laggeen qaban hinjiran** - The text doesn't mention anything about a lack of fences.
* **C: Gaaroonni isaanii baay’inaan diriiroo dha** - While the text describes a type of hill (""ol-kaoon""), it doesn't say that the areas of Rogaland and Agder are *primarily* hills. It focuses on the heather protection.

    * Mountains rising steeply like pillars (""dachaawwan lafa ol jedhaa akka diriiraatti suuta adeemuuni"")
    * Vast, open landscapes (""vidde"" - large, open, treeless plains)
    * Heaths (""hei"") - moorland not covered in trees, often protected by heather.

* **Option C - Sulula laggeenii irraan gadee cimaa (Strong glacial erosion)**, while related to the *formation* of the landscape described, isn't presented as a *characteristic* that Noorweey is *known for* in the passage.

Here's why:

The passage states that tourists visit during the monsoon season in India *specifically* to see the abundant waterfalls. It also mentions activities *related* to the heavy rains, like water rushing from the mountains. Therefore, the peak time for tourists is when the rainfall is at its strongest (cabbii cimaa).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Guutumma waqtii xaawulladhaan cabbiirra mucucaachuu** (All the time enjoying the rain) - This is *an activity* tourists do, not the *time* they visit.
* **C: Yeroo bona Indiyaanotaa** (During Indian festivals) - The passage doesn't mention festivals as a reason for visiting.

* **D: Warra akka kee bidiruu eegan ilaalcha keessa galchuu dhiisuu (Not including those waiting like you in your consideration):** The passage encourages actively seeking out and assisting others.

(As you approach the airport looking for a ride, everything will be clear to you.) and then goes on to describe observing people and gathering information. This strongly suggests being observant and ""on the radar"" - actively looking and noticing your surroundings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

Seenaa kolonii Odolootaa keessatti naannoo kamtu Daawwattoota hawwachuu danda’a?,"The correct answer is **A: Yaa’a Kaabaa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ijaarsi lafa bishaaniin gidduu Hoongi Koongi irra caalaan fedhii lafa bal’aa **yaa’a kaabaa** irratti kan hundaa’eedha."" This directly links Ya'a Kaabaa as a place of interest for colonists and therefore a place someone researching colonial records might start.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Qarqara galaanaa Koowiloon:** While mentioned as a viewing point *of* Hoongi Koongi, it's not the place colonists specifically favored.
*   **C: Gidduu Hoongi Koongi:** The passage emphasizes looking *from* a higher ground towards Hoongi Koongi, not being *in* the middle of it.
*   **D: Buufata doonii Viiktooriyaa:** This refers to the Victoria Harbour, used as a comparison for the landscape but not a colonial settlement area.



"
Bakka kamtu daawwattootaaf ilaalcha hawwataa akka argataniif dursa kenna?,"The correct answer is **C: Odola Hoongi Koongi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Odolli Hoongi Koongi daangaa Hoongi Koongiif moggaasa isaa kan kenneef fi bakkichi bakka tuuristoonni hedduun akka xiyyeeffannoo guddaatti fudhataniidha."" This directly translates to ""Odolli Hoongi Koongi gives access to Hoongi Koongi and the place is a major attraction for tourists.""

The passage then goes on to describe *how* to view Hoongi Koongi, but *Odolli Hoongi Koongi* is presented as the primary point of access and interest for tourists.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Buufata doonii Viiktooriyaa:** While mentioned in relation to the landscape, it's not the place tourists primarily focus on.
*   **B: Hoongi Koongi sirrii:** This is the feature itself, not the access point tourists prefer. The passage implies tourists go *to* Odolli Hoongi Koongi to *see* Hoongi Koongi.
*   **D: Qarqara galaanaa Koowiloon:** This is a location you reach *from* Hoongi Koongi to get a better view, not the initial attraction.



"
Koorichaawwan tokko tokko miilli nama Farda irra jiruu akka sadilii keessatti hin hafneef waan gargaaru maal qabu?,"The correct answer is **A: Soolii qaldhoo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...kan koomee qabuu fi **soolii qaldhoo lallaafaa qabu keewwatu**."" This translates to ""...having a sufficient amount of **loose hay** available.""  The passage explains this hay is important for the horse to bite on, preventing the rider's hands from being pulled or injured if the horse gets startled.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Qabannoo of eeggannoo (Preventative measures):** While preventative measures are mentioned overall, the text doesn't specify they help *keep* a rider from falling off.
*   **C: Baattuu leezarii (Laser device):** Laser devices are mentioned in relation to saddle design, but not as a method to prevent falls.
*   **D: Tasgabba’iinsa olaanaa (Great comfort):** Comfort is mentioned as a benefit, but not as the direct mechanism for preventing a rider from being pulled.



"
Kopheewwan ittiin farda kaachisan keessaa isa kamtu yeroo sadilii fayyadamaniif of eeggannoo fooyyessuuf gargaara?,"The correct answer is **C: Komee kan qabu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dura, konkolaachistoonni baayyeen kophee boottii ittiin oofan kan koomee qabuu fi soolii qaldhoo lallaafaa qabu keewwatu."" This directly links *komee qabu* (having a rein) to safety when using a saddle. The passage explains it's a preventative measure for the danger described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Faana dhiphaa, shaakarraa’aa** - These aren't mentioned in the text as safety features.
*   **B: Leezarii** - Leezarota are mentioned in relation to *saddles* and preventing injury *after* a fall, not preventing the fall itself.
*   **D: Soolii bal’aa** - This is mentioned alongside *komee qabu*, but *komee qabu* is presented as the primary preventative measure.

Imaltoota karaa Walitti-hidhamiinsa gaarummaa wal jijjiiruun taasisaniif maaltu dhiyaachuu danda’a?,"Correct answer: **C: Daawwannaa namoota naannootiin kennamu**

Here's why:

The passage states that the ""Walitti-hidhamiinsa gaarummaa wal jijjiiruu"" (roughly translated as ""reciprocal helpfulness network"") facilitates **connecting people in the area** with those visiting the cities. It's about locals *showing* visitors around. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Meeshaalee namoota naannootiin** (Local items) - The passage doesn't mention exchanging goods.
*   **B: gatii gadi bu’aatiin balali’uu** (Expanding with reduced costs) -  Cost is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Walitti dhufeenya namoota biroo bakka wal fakkaataa daawwatanii wajjin** (The connection of other people visiting similar places together) - The focus is on connecting visitors *with locals*, not visitors with other visitors.

Here's why:

The passage states the service focuses on *connecting* travelers with locals for interaction and support. It doesn't say locals are *always* available or prepared for travelers.  It emphasizes facilitating connection, but not a guaranteed, constant local presence.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

* **B:** ""neetwoorkiiwwan tokko tokko mirkaneessa dabalataa yoo dhiyeessan ykn barbaadan illee"" - This directly supports the need for some level of verification.
* **C:** “Ergaasi tarreefamni keessummeesituu barreeffamaan fi/ykn marsariitiin kallattiin kennama, yeroo tokko tokkommoo ragaa waliin fi keessa deebii imaltootaan kennamuun ni godhama.” - This indicates travelers receive personalized information and sometimes feedback from locals, helping them navigate.
* **D:** “yeroo tokko tokkommoo ragaa waliin fi keessa deebii imaltootaan kennamuun ni godhama.” - Directly states that feedback from locals is sometimes provided.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, keessummaa akkamiitu carraan hoosteelii waliin qoddatanii isa qaqqabuu danda’a?","Correct answer: **A: Keessummaa umurii diigdamoota gara jalqabaa**

Here's why:

The passage states that hostels often house young people (teenagers), but also frequently have older individuals. It specifically mentions families with children being seen, suggesting a range of ages. However, the key phrase is ""gosoni keessummootaa warren umuriin digdamman kessaa jiranidha"" (often housing youth in the early stages of adulthood).  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Keessumaa qofaa isaa imalu:** The passage explicitly states *both* young and older people are found in hostels.
* **C: Keessummaa ijoollee xixiqqoo wajjin jiru:** While families *are* mentioned, it's not the primary demographic described.
* **D: Keessummaa umurii Soddomaan walakkaa:**  The passage doesn't mention a specific age like ""over fifty.""

Therefore, the most accurate generalization about the hostel's demographics, based on the provided text, is a focus on young adults in the early stages of adulthood."
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Eenyutu carraa hoosteelii turuu olaanaa qaba?","Correct Answer: **D: Maatii lama ijoollee isaanii waliin imalan**

Here's why:

* **The Passage States:** ""Qopheessitoonni hoosteelii yeroo baayyee namoota umuriin ijoolleedha...garuu yeroo bayyee imaltoota umurniin deemanis argachuu dandeessa. Maatiiwwan ijoollee qaban darbanii darbanii argamu, garuu manneen ciisichaa muraasni kutaa dhuunfaa isaaniif ni eeyyamu."" (Hostels frequently accommodate younger people – often university students – but can also accommodate older adults. Families with children are less common, but some hostels offer family rooms.)

* **Option D directly aligns with this information.** The passage specifically mentions families *being less common* but *present* in hostels, implying they are a relevant group.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Jaalalleewwan mucaa reefuu dhalattu of duukaa qaban:** The passage doesn't mention people traveling alone.
* **B: Namoota sadii umuriin 22 waliin imalan:**  While 22 is young, the passage doesn't focus on groups specifically.
* **C: Jaalalleewwan umuriin 70 keessa:**  The passage mentions older adults, but specifically highlights *families* as less common but still present.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Buumeraangii gara harka keetti deebi’u barachuu yoo barbaadde, buumeraangii isa sirrii deebiidhaaf qabaachuu kee mirkaneeffadhu.""  This directly translates to ""If you want to learn to have a boomerang return to your hand, you must ensure you have the right boomerang for returning.""  This means correct technique and the right boomerang will make it return.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Daawwattoota caalaa namoota naannoo biratti beekamaa dha** - The passage doesn't mention anything about how well-known boomerangs are to observers vs. locals.
* **C: Aawustiraaliyaa keessa Buumeraangiin hedduuminaan hin argamu** - The passage states, “Buumeraangiiwwan Awustiraaliyaa keessa jiran hedduun...” meaning many boomerangs are *found* in Australia.
* **D: Buumeraangii muraasa qofatu deebi’uu danda’a** - The passage doesn’t say only some boomerangs can return, but that the *right* boomerang is needed for a return.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa mala nyaata bilcheessuu kamtu irra caalmaan Jaavaanotaan fayyadamama?,"Correct Answer: **C: Sukkaara kokonaatii**

**Explanation:**

The text specifically states: ""sukkaara warra jaavaa kan kokonatiiti"" (Java's coconut sugar) is frequently used by Javanese people as a sweetener. While other sweeteners are mentioned, coconut sugar is highlighted as particularly favored by them."
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Dhukkubni daddarbaa akkamitti faffaca’a?","The correct answer is **A: Namoota hubaman** (People who are infected).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dhukkuboonni daddarboon dhukkuboota haala salphaan nama hubametti waan siqaniif qofa namarra namatti dadddarbanidha.""  This translates to: ""Contagious diseases are only spread from person to person because they can affect people easily.""

Therefore, the passage directly links the spread of contagious diseases to **infected people**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dhibee uumtoota** (Animal diseases) - The passage doesn't focus on diseases transmitted from animals.
*   **C: Baakteeriyoota** (Bacteria) - While bacteria *cause* some contagious diseases, they aren't the *way* the disease spreads.
*   **D: Talaallii** (Vaccines) - Vaccines *prevent* diseases, they don't spread them."
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Maaltu akka dhibee uumaatti hin beekamu?","The correct answer is **A: Talaallii (Vaccination)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that diseases are caused by things like viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites. It explicitly lists these as *causes* of disease.  It then discusses how governments want to monitor people entering and leaving the country for *diseases*.

Vaccinations (talaallii) aren't a *cause* of disease; they *prevent* disease. They are a method of protection *against* the things that cause illness (viruses, bacteria, etc.). 

Therefore, vaccination is the one option that doesn't fit the description of something that is a disease-causing agent.

Haala kam keessatti pirooksiin weebii dhiyeessaa VPN dhuunfaa caalaa fayyadamaaf gahaa ta’a?,"Correct answer: **C: Fayyadamaan dursaan tiraafika http irra deebiin root yeroo godhu**

Here's why:

The passage states that VPNs are superior to web proxies because they can route *all* internet traffic, not just HTTP. It also mentions that proxies are better when you only need to route HTTP traffic.  Therefore, a web proxy is sufficient (and might even be preferred for simplicity) when the user *only* needs to route HTTP traffic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yeroo fayyadamaan tiraafika hundumaa irra deebiin root gochuu barbaadu** - The passage specifically states VPNs are better for routing *all* traffic.
*   **B: Yommuu fayyadamaan saaxilamuu fi basaasamuu carraa argamee kamiinuu hambisuu barbaadu** - VPNs are harder to detect due to being coded, making them better for privacy.
*   **D: Hojiin fayyadamaa baandiwiidzii giddu galeessaa hamma olaanaatti barbaaduu** - VPNs often offer higher bandwidth."
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, himoota armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee VPNs fii pirooksiiwwan weebii kamtu dhugaa miti?","Correct answer is **D: VPN qofaatu tiraafika http irra deebiin root gochuu danda’a**.

Here's why:

The text states that VPNs can route *all* internet traffic, not just HTTP. It specifically says ""Irraa deebiin root godhanii Tiraafiika inteerneta, http qofa miti"" which translates to ""They route all internet traffic, not just HTTP.""  Therefore, the statement that *only* VPNs can route HTTP traffic is false.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the text:

*   **A: VPNiin baandiwiidzii olaanaa pirooksiiwwan weebii caalaa dhiyeessa** - The text says VPNs often offer higher bandwidth.
*   **B: Bakka bu’ootni marsaariitii Sosochii hundumaa karaa biraatiin taasisuu hin danda’an** - The text indicates that VPNs are difficult to trace (""Iccitiidhaan waan barreeffamaniif basaasuudhaaf rakkisoodha""), implying they offer privacy and can help bypass monitoring.
*   **C: Pirooksiiwwan weebii yommuu VPN wajjin wal bira qabaman qulqullina tajaajilaa gadi bu’a qabu** - This is a reasonable inference. If you're using both, the proxy adds another layer that could potentially slow things down or create issues.

Namni tokkoKaampaanii bilbila isaa battala sanatti bakka jiruu alatti akka fayyadamu maaltu gochuu danda’a?,"The correct answer is **C: Saatalaayitii**.

Here's why:

The passage states that someone in Chicken, Alaska can *receive* an internet satellite signal and *appear* to be calling from an Arizona number. This demonstrates how satellite technology allows bypassing traditional area codes and making it seem like you're calling from a different location, regardless of where you physically are.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bilbila intarneetiidhaan raawwataman (Internet-based calls):** While internet-based calls are mentioned, the passage focuses on *how* someone can appear to be calling from a different location, which is through satellite technology.
*   **B: Lakkoofsota addunyaawaa ta’an (International numbers):** The passage states you *need* to pay for international numbers, but doesn't say that's how you bypass location restrictions.
*   **D: Bilbiloota PSTNi (PSTN calls):** The passage implies bypassing the traditional PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) is possible, not using it.



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, bilbiloota murtaa’an simachuuf maaltu ta’uu qaba?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkoofsa addunyaawaa bitachuu**.

(Often, you need to purchase international numbers so that the established-restricted phone network can call you).

This directly implies that to receive calls from specific phones, you *must* pay for an international number.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dhaabbata bilbilaa naannoo fayyadamuu** - The passage suggests you can *avoid* being tied to a local phone company.
*   **C: Hawaasa naannoo kee irraa lakkoofsa fudhachuu** - The passage provides an example of using a satellite internet connection to *avoid* showing a local area code.
*   **D: Lakkoofsa PSTNii bituu** - While PSTN is the traditional phone network, the passage specifically highlights the need for *international* numbers for access from certain networks.

Here's why:

The passage states that pronunciation *changes* depending on the following letter (like with 'c' and 'g'). It doesn't say the pronunciation of many words is *completely different* from how they are written - it says it *adapts* based on context. The other options are all directly supported by the text:

*   **A: ‘’rr’’in ‘’r’’ irraa haala gargar ta’een sagaleeffama** - The passage explicitly highlights the difference in pronunciation between 'r' and 'rr'.
*   **B: Jechoonni baay’een akka barreeffamaniin sagaleeffamu** - The passage starts by saying it's generally easier to pronounce Italian as it's written.
*   **C: Jechoonni qubee c fi g nama dogoggorsuu danda’u** - The text says 'c' and 'g' can be tricky because their pronunciation changes.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yeroo ta’ee tokko magaalan qaroomina Simirina, amma ammayawaa, kan guddate, fi bakka gabaa wal xaxaa dha, bakka banaa naannoo gidduti argama akkasumaas gaarotan marfameera. **Bakka bal’aa , gamoowwan foddaa fuulle tanafimanneen gurgurtaa ammmayyaa garagaraa baaxii aadaa diimaatiin kan haguugaman**...""

This directly links the ancient city of Smyrna to the presence of ruins (gamoowwan foddaa fuullee). The passage highlights that Izmir grew from this ancient foundation, making the ruins its earlier identity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Karaawaan babal’oo** - The text doesn't mention anything about caravans or wide roads.
*   **C: Giddu galeessa bittaa** - This refers to Izmir being a good transit point, a later characteristic of its development.
*   **D: Baaxii aadaa diimaa** - The text mentions this as something that *protects* the ruins, not the earlier identity of the city itself."
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa Kamtu ittiin beekamtii Izmiir sirrii miti?,"Correct answer is **A: Magaalichi gaara guddaa marsa**.

Here's why:

The text states Izmir is ""gaarotan marfameera"" (surrounded by mountains), but it doesn't say it *has* large mountains itself. It implies the mountains are around it, not *in* it.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **B: Haalii achii aadaa Turkii calaqqisiisa** - The text says it has a Mediterranean/European climate and ""kan aadaa Turkii caalaa"" (more than Turkish culture) implying it has a distinct cultural flavor.
*   **C: Giddu gala bittaa ammayyaa fi Manneen amantaa durii lamaanuu argachuu ni dandeessa** - The text mentions ""giddu gala gabaa jaarraa 18ffaa, manneen amantaafi maskiida moofaa"" (18th-century bazaar, historical religious buildings and mosques).
*   **D: Buufata doonii akka Turkiitti guddinaan lammaffaa ta’e qaba** - The text clearly states Izmir is the second largest port in Turkey (""Istaanbulitti aanteebuufata doonii guddinaan sadarkaa lammaffaarra jirtu"")."
Jechi haanaamii jedhu ilaalcha maalii ibsa?,"Correct answer: **A: Daraarota cheerrii**

Here's why:

The passage states that *haanamii* is a very popular custom that came from Chinese divination and became a beloved form of **fortune-telling**.  The passage then goes on to describe how the earliest form of this fortune-telling practice was used for predicting outcomes for the emperor and the aristocracy. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Jaappaanota kutaa olaanaa** - While the practice *was* initially limited to the upper class, *haanamii* itself isn't *about* them.
*   **C: Biqiloota Piluumii** - This is not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Mana murtii impeeriyaalaa** - The Imperial Court was a place where the practice was performed, but *haanamii* isn't the court itself.

Eenyutu sagantaa bashannanaa yeroo jalqabaaf daawwannaa Daraarota cheeriif ta’u qopheesse?,"The correct answer is **B: Aristookiraasota Jaappaan**.

The text states: ""Jaappaan keessatti, affeeraan sirna daraaraa cheerrii jalqabaa mootichaafi miseensota biroo aristookiraasii naannoo mana murtii impeeriyaalaa qofa hirmaachise geggeeffame."" This translates to: ""In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing ceremony was organized by the emperor and other aristocrats around the imperial court.""

Therefore, the initial cherry blossom viewing was organized by Japanese aristocrats, not the Chinese emperor or Chinese aristocrats."

    *   Cultural importance (center of faith and tradition, archaeological sites)

*   **""Seena nama ajaa’ibu"" (Amazing human stories)** is not mentioned in the passage. While Jerusalem undoubtedly *has* amazing human stories, the text doesn't highlight this aspect. The passage is centered on the city's broader historical, religious, cultural, and political context.

*   **B: Dhiibbaa siyaasaa (Political significance):** The passage explicitly mentions other countries recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
*   **C: Barbaachisummaa karaa amantaa (Religious significance):** The text strongly emphasizes Jerusalem's importance to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
*   **D: Bakkeewwan aadaa (Cultural sites):** The passage mentions archaeological sites, historical sites, and a vibrant atmosphere with cafes and restaurants."

The passage states that buying a Wild Card allows access to *either* selected South African parks *or* all parks within South African National Parks (SAANParks).  Someone who *only* plans to visit Kruger National Park doesn't need the Wild Card. They can simply pay the daily conservation and entry fees.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Imalaa paarkii Biyyoolessaa Afriikaa Kibbaa hamma danda’e daawwachuuf karoora qabu** - This is *exactly* what the Wild Card is for, so they *would* benefit from it.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the park is 19,500 km² in size.** This is a significant area, and while it might not be the *largest* park in South Africa, it's certainly not implied to be the *smallest*.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Akka Hawwannaa Afriikaa Kibbaa cimaatti ilaalama (As a prominent South African attraction):** The passage states it's one of the most well-known attractions in South Africa.
* **B: Jireenyi bineensotaa ikoozoonii baay’ee paarkichi qabu gidduutti garaagara (Diverse animal life within the park):** The passage says it's divided into 14 sections each supporting different animal species.

This highlights the danger of unpredictable weather, specifically fog and altitude sickness.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

*   **B: Gulantaa dhagaa (Stone steps)** - While the steps are steep and can be tiring, the passage states people can climb them in 45 minutes, and they are maintained with railings.
*   **C: Holqa xiqqoo (Small holes)** - The passage mentions small holes to step into, suggesting they are part of the path and expected.

The passage explicitly states: ""**baayee ol ka’aa dha fi qooqa cimaa**"" which translates to ""it is very high and has a strong slope"". This directly contradicts option B, which states there isn't a strong slope. 

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: Waarumti seeraan yaabbachuu danda’an iyyuu hafuura cituu danda’u** - ""Sun erga jedhamee, hafuura baafachuu dadhabuueegi"" supports this (lack of breath can occur even when trying to climb according to rules).
*   **C: Gararraa isaatti holqa keessa darbuu qabda** - ""Irra isaatti dhiyaatee holqa xiqqootu jira kan keessa darbamu qabu"" directly supports this.

While vegetables like tomatoes, aubergines (aaybii), and courgettes (qurxummii) are included, *ija midhaanii* (greens/leafy vegetables) are not explicitly mentioned as a core part of the Majorcan diet described in the text. Therefore, it's the least likely to be a defining ingredient."
"Odeeffannoo kuticha keessaa irratti hundaa’uudhaan, hima waa’ee nyaata Hangii kamtu dhugaa miti?","Correct answer is **B: Hangiin dhagaa ho’aa fayyadamuun Weeliingitanii keessatti ni argama.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that *Kiraayiticherchi, Weeliingitaniifi bakkeessan biroo irraa iddatteeffamuu kan danda’an* (can be found in places like Kiraayiticherchi, Weeliingitani and other places) **but** these are *boollawwan ho’aan keessatti midhaan bilcheessan* (cooked food in hot springs). It doesn’t say Hangi *uses* hot stones in Wellington.
*   **A** is true: The passage says ""Boollichi dhagaa ho’a abiddicha keessaatiin rukutamuun"" (The cooking is done by using hot stones).
*   **C** is true: The passage says ""boolli midhaan itti bilcheessan yeroo baay’ee dhiyana akkaataa waaddii aadaa bilcheessuuf gargaara."" (cooking food often resembles the traditional way of cooking).
*   **D** is true: The passage says ""bakkeewwan hedduun Rotorua keessaa boolla uumamaan ho’aa, kan keessatti midhaan bilcheessanii qabu."" (many places in Rotorua have naturally hot springs where food is cooked).



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa mala beekamaa boolla Hangii ittiin ho’isan ta’ee kan hin eeramne kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Gaazii**.

Here's why:

The passage states Nyaati Hangii boils due to:

*   **Dhagaa ho’a** (Hot rocks) - being heated by hot rocks in the earth.
*   **Ho’a hurka lafa keessaa** (Geothermal heat) - heat from within the earth itself.

It *does not* mention gas being used to heat the pools. Therefore, gas is the method not mentioned in the text.

While option D is the same as option B, the question asks for what is *not* mentioned, so either one of those answers would be correct."
Moloksee dhiiraa yookiin dubaraa maaltu addatti beekuuf dandeessisa?,"The correct answer is **A: Maraa ifaa ta’ee sirriitti golgu uffachuu** (Having a clear and properly fitting garment).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...keessattuu kan halluu ifaa ta’e qabu, balbalarratti monoksee isa dhiiraa ykn ishee dubaraa irraa seeqa argatta."" This translates to ""...especially if they have a clear one, they can get a glimpse from the male or female garment.""  This directly links a clear garment to being able to see what's underneath.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gateettii kee golguu** (Seeing your dignity) - While dignity is implied as a concern, the passage doesn't say seeing a garment reveals dignity.
* **C: Maraa manneen amantii ergifachuu** (Supporting religious institutions) - The passage mentions religious institutions providing coverings, but doesn't say seeing a garment supports them.
* **D: Marxoo jilba gararraatti hafu uffachuu** (Covering the knees on different garments) - The passage focuses on *seeing through* garments, not just covering knees.



"
Uffannaa armaan gadii keessaa kamtu mana qamantiitii ergifachuuf argamuu dhiisuu danda’a? ,"The correct answer is **A: Marxoo**.

Here's why:

The text states that women who come to religious places unprepared (without *marxoo*) are given *marxoo*. It also mentions that if a woman *chooses* to bring her own, especially a visibly clean one, she might get a leak from the male or female bathroom. This implies *marxoo* is *provided* by the religious places, and therefore, wouldn't be something you'd typically *find* being offered for disposal (i.e., something you'd discard and need to be disposed of). 

The other options (Surree gabaabaa, Surree, and Marata) are all types of garments that *could* potentially be discarded and therefore found needing disposal. Specifically, the text directly discusses men being prevented from dropping their *surree*.



"
Daawwattoonni yommuu naannoo Antaarkitikii daawwatan yoom carraa guddaa urjiilee ilaaluu qabu?,"The correct answer is **A: Yeroo Bonaa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Yoo waqxii bonaatti Arkiitik ykn Antarkiitikii daawwatte, galgala fiixee utubaa lafaa argita..."" (If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic during winter, you can see a clear starry sky, meaning the world is bright and the horizon doesn't reach high into the sky).  It links the best viewing opportunities to the winter season (Bonaa).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yeroo naannoo sanatti namni hinbaay’anne:** The passage doesn't mention a time when people don't visit, only that remoteness is a benefit.
* **C: Yeroo ji’oota Gannaa:** The passage doesn't mention the summer months (Gannaa).
* **D: Yeroo faalamni qilleensaa gadi aanaa ta’u:** While a mild climate is mentioned as a benefit, it's not directly tied to the *best* time for seeing the auroras and stars. The winter season (Bonaa) is the key factor.



"
Bilbilli saatalaayitii yoom bilbila moobaayilaa bakka bu’uu hin danda’u?,"The correct answer is **B: Yoo naannichii baay’ee fagoo ta’e (If the area is very remote)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that satellite phones are useful when you are *far from city networks and where there is no cellular network*.  This implies they *can't* replace mobile phones in areas *with* good cellular coverage.  Being in a very remote area is the defining characteristic where a satellite phone is necessary.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yoo sararri kallattii saatalaayitii dhorkame (If the satellite signal is blocked):**  While signal blockage is a problem, it doesn't mean a satellite phone *can't* replace a mobile phone; it just means it isn't working *at that moment*.
*   **C: Yoo bakkeetti fayyadamama ta’e (If it's being used on the ground):** Satellite phones are designed to be used on the ground.
*   **D: Yoo saffisni daataa murtaa’e barbaada ta’e (If a specific data speed is required):**  The passage mentions data needs but doesn't state satellite phones can't meet *all* data speed requirements.



"
Bilbilli saatalaayitii bilbila moobaayilaa caalaa yoom filatama?,"The correct answer is **A: Yeroo boqonnaa magaalaa keessaaf** (When you are far from city networks).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bakkoota magaalaa irra fagootti, bakka neetworkiin bilbilaa hin jirretti, bilbilli Saatalayitii filannoo tokkicha ati qabdu ta’uu danda’a."" (In places far from cities, where there is no mobile network, a satellite phone may be your only option.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yeroo dooniidhaan deemamuuf** (When traveling by boat) - While satellite phones *can* be useful on boats, the passage doesn't specifically highlight this as the primary reason for choosing one.
* **C: Yeroo daataan fagoo dirqama hin taanetti** (When long-distance data is not required) - The passage mentions satellite phones *handle* long-distance data, so this isn't a reason to *choose* them over mobile phones.
* **D: Yeroo tajaajila bilbila harkaa gahaa qabaachuu dandeessutti** (When you can get roadside assistance) - Roadside assistance is irrelevant to the core function of a satellite phone - providing connectivity where mobile networks are absent.



"
waldhabbii kanneen armaan gadii kam irratti uumametu uumamuu Riippaablikii Tiraanisnistriyaaf sababa ta’e?,"Correct answer: **A: Diinagdee**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Walitti dhufeenyi dinagdee irra deebiin ijaarameera qaamota kana lamaan Moldoova gidduti kufatii haasaa siyaasa fallaan.""  This translates to ""Economic disagreements were the basis for conflict between these two Moldovan parties and led to political disputes."" The text then links this to the creation of the Transnistria Republic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sabummaa** - While the text mentions regional divisions (""kan baha Moldoovaatti geesse""), it doesn't state that ethnic identity was the *cause* of the republic's formation.
*   **C: Afaan** - The text notes language differences (Romanian vs. Russian), but doesn't present this as the root cause of the conflict.
*   **D: Amantaa** - The text mentions the dominant religion, but doesn't connect it to the conflict's origins."
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa Riippaablikiin Tiraanisnistriyaa kanneen biroo Moldoovaa keessa jiraan irraan waan adda ta’e maal qaba?  ,"Correct answer is **C: Beekkamtii Mootummoota Gamtoomanii**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Transnistria ""is not recognized by any of the member states of the United Nations."" This is a key difference between it and the rest of Moldova, which presumably seeks and receives some level of international recognition (even if the text doesn't detail it).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Afaan** - Both areas use Russian widely.
*   **B: Amantaa** - Both areas primarily practice Orthodox Christianity.
*   **D: Maallaqa** - The text mentions Transnistria has its own currency, but doesn't state Moldova doesn't. It focuses on the political independence, not specifically economic differences.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, imaltoonni haalli qilleensaa bubbeen akka isaan hin qaqqabne yoo abdatu ta’e, Montevidiyoo yoom daawwachuu qabu?","The correct answer is **A: Yeroo ji’oota Gannaa Heemisfeera Kaabaa**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Montevideo experiences summer when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice-versa. It also describes the ""ganna"" (summer) in Montevideo as hot (over 30°C). The question asks when to visit to avoid hot and humid conditions. Therefore, you'd want to go during the *summer* in the Southern Hemisphere (which is the winter in the Northern Hemisphere), which is referred to as ""ji’oota Gannaa Heemisfeera Kaabaa"" in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yeroo waqtii gogaa Montevidiyoo:**  The passage doesn't give information about a specific ""gogaa"" (spring) time.
* **C: Yeroo ji’oota Bonaa Heemisfeera Kaabaa:** ""Bona"" is described as the winter, and the passage states Montevideo is hot *during* its summer.
* **D: Yeroo waqtii Gannaa Montevidiyoo:** This would be the hottest and most humid time to visit, the exact condition the question asks to avoid.



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Imaltoonni yoo qilleensi qbbanaa’aan in mijataaf ta’e, Montavidiyoo yoom daawwachuu qabu?","The correct answer is **A: Yeroo Montevidiyoo keessatti Bona ta’u**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Montevidio experiences its hottest temperatures (ganna) when it's summer in the Southern Hemisphere and *when it is Bona*.  The question asks when Imaltoons would be most comfortable with warm weather in Montevidio. Therefore, the answer is when Montevidio is experiencing its “Bona” period, which is its hottest time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Yeroo Heemisfeera Kaabaatti Bona ta’u:** This is the *cause* of Montevidio’s ganna, not when Imaltoons would be comfortable *in* Montevidio.
*   **C: Yeroo Montevidiyootti waqtii roobaa ta’u:** The passage states that there aren't really distinct ""rainy seasons,"" just consistent rainfall throughout the year.
*   **D: Yeroo Heemisfeera Kaabaatti Ganna ta’u:** This is the opposite of when Montevidio is hottest. When the Southern Hemisphere is experiencing winter (“Ganna”), Montevidio is cooler.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Haa ta’u malee, yeroo ammaatti artiistoota giraafitii, agarsiisa girafitii fi keenyan “sera-qabeessa”tu dhaabbatanii jiru. Barreeffamoonni giraafitii haala kana keessatti taagiiwwan seeraan alaarra yeroo baay’ee hojiwwan aartii fakkaatu.""

This directly links graffiti writings (barreeffamoonni giraafitii) to acts that are often considered art but are legally questionable (like damaging public property). The passage contrasts these modern, artistic graffiti with the simple act of vandalism. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Eeggannoo malee kaafaman:** While graffiti is often done without permission, this describes *how* it's done, not *what* it is.
* **C: Fakkii keenyan qabeenya hawaasaa irrattii hin barbaachisne:**  This is a general statement about unwanted images, but it doesn't specifically connect to graffiti.
* **D: Maxxansa seeraan alaa:** This describes the *legal consequence* of graffiti, not the graffiti itself.



"
Qaama jiloota muuziqaa kamtu hirmaattota muraasaan akka muuxannoo murteessaatti ilaalama?,"The correct answer is **B: Iddoo sanatti godoo godhachuu** (Creating a scene/atmosphere).

Here's why:

The passage states ""hirmaattotni baayyeenis gocha kana qaama muuxannichaa isa barbaachisaa akka ta’etti fudhatu"" - many participants accept this act as an essential part of the experience. The ""act"" referred to is creating a scene or atmosphere (""iddooma sanatti godoo godhachuu"") through their behavior at the concert. This is what the passage highlights as making the concert a special experience.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ijoollee fiduu** (Having children) - The passage mentions families with children *being* at the festival, but doesn't say it's what defines the experience for participants.
*   **C: Muuziqaa galgala keessa taphachuu** (Dancing to music at night) - While dancing is mentioned, it's a *result* of the atmosphere, not the atmosphere itself.
*   **D: Dursanii seenuu** (Arriving early) - This is a practical step to get a good spot, but doesn’t define the experiential quality of the concert.



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, hirmaattonni jila muuziqaa yoo naannoo muuziqaatti siqanii buufachuu barbaadan dursa maal gochuu qabu?","Correct answer: **D: Dursanii seenuu**

**Explanation:**

The passage states: ""Gara gochaatti dhiyaachuu yoo barbaadde, bakkee buufataa muuziqichatti dhiyaatu argachuudhaaf, dursitee seenuudha qabda."" 

This translates to: ""If you want to participate in the performance, to get a seat in the music area, you must arrive early."" 

Therefore, the correct answer is arriving early (""dursanii seenuu"")."
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Daawwattoonni yeroo bineensota galgalaa Kaaba Niiw Meeksikootti barbaadan, bakka kam dhiisuu qabu?","Correct answer: **B: Mana dhugaatii magaalaa xixiqqoo**

Here's why:

The passage states that small-town restaurants are *not* always a good option for out-of-state visitors seeking authentic cuisine in New Mexico. It specifically mentions that New Mexico has issues with ""machaa’anii"" (likely meaning imitation or inauthentic) food, and the proportion of inauthentic restaurants is higher in smaller towns.  

Therefore, if a visitor is looking for the real deal, the passage implies they should be wary of small-town restaurants. The other options aren't directly addressed as places to avoid; the focus is specifically on the risk in smaller restaurants."
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Daawwataan Kaaba Niiw Meeksikoo keessatti naannoo kam akka bakka bashannanaa sirriitti beekamaa ta’eetti argachuu danda’a?","Correct answer: **D: Mana dhugaatii magaalaa xiqqootti**

Here's why:

The passage states that small-town casinos are often where ""cheaters are known to frequent"" (particularly those who have been caught in Albuquerque and Santa Fe). It also points out that New Mexico casinos have a significant problem with cheating, and that cheating incidents are *more common* in smaller casinos. This makes a small-town casino the most likely place for a cheater to be found.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bakka mana qumaaraa Albuquerque irraa sa’aatii lama fagaatee:** The passage doesn't suggest cheaters concentrate in casinos a specific distance from Albuquerque.
*   **B: Puyeebiloo fagootti:** Puyeebiloo isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Mana qumaaraa Santa Fe dhiyoo ta’etti:** While cheaters are known in Santa Fe, the passage implies they are *more likely* to be found in smaller towns to avoid detection."
Imaltoonni baajata isaanii seeraan qabatan dhugaatii gosa kam hambisuu barbaadu?,"The correct answer is **D: Cuunfaa kuduraa**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Cuunfaan kuduraa qaaliidha garuu baay'ee bayeessa."" (Couscous is expensive but very filling). This implies that it's a food that people might want to *limit* if they are on a budget, as it is costly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Daadhii wayinii Awustiraaliyaa:** The passage suggests it is *preferred* over French wine, not something to be avoided.
*   **B: Bishaan qaruuraatiin gurguramu:** This is presented as an *easy* and *available* option if one doesn't want tap water.
*   **C: Biiraa naannoo:** Described as ""cold and refreshing"", there's no implication it needs to be limited.



"
"Iddoo kuticha keessatti ibsame irratti hundaa’uudhaan, ajaja dhugaatii armaan gadii keessaa kamtu keessummeessaan adda baasuun rakkisuu danda’a?","Correct answer is **D: Battee adii**.

Here's why:

*   **The text states:** ""Awustiraaliyaanotaaf, yaadni buna ‘adii battee’ jedhu baadaadha."" (For Australians, the idea of 'flat white' coffee is passé/old-fashioned.) This means ordering a flat white in Australia might be seen as outdated, making it a potentially confusing or incorrect order if someone is expecting the current popular choice.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely to cause confusion:

*   **A: Gabaabaa gurraacha:** The text clearly states ""Gurraachi gabaabaan ‘ispireesoo’"" (A short espresso).
*   **B: Lakkoofsa tokko:** This refers to a specific cafe, and you can order at any cafe.
*   **C: Saawuvinyoon Bilaankii Niwu Zilaandii:** The text indicates New Zealand wines are highly regarded, so asking for a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc is a reasonable request.

Therefore, ""Battee adii"" is the most likely order to be misunderstood or considered unusual based on the information provided in the text."
"Jaarrota sadiif kan ture, Yeroon kolonaayizeeshinii gartuu kamiin jalqabamee ture?","The correct answer is **D: Ispaaniyaardota**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ispaaniyaardotatu sirna kolonii jarraa sadiif ture jalqabe."" This directly translates to ""The Spanish started the three-century colonial system."" 

Therefore, the three-century colonial period began with the Spanish. The other options (Payagu’a, Guyaakorii, and Guwarani) are groups *affected* by colonization, but not the initiators of it.



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Karaan filatamaan ittiin Pariisiyaanota ittiin ofitti qabdu maali?","The correct answer is **A: Ilaalcha isaanii fakkeessuu yaaluudhaan**.

Here's why:

The passage states Parisians are known for being aloof and self-interested, but also for being well-mannered (""bien élevé""). It then says imitating this well-mannered behavior makes interacting with them easier. This means the preferred way to engage with Parisians is to *appear* to share their values and demeanor – to **imitate their attitude**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ofitti amanamummaa hir’isuudhaan** - The passage doesn't suggest diminishing their aloofness. It suggests working *within* it.
* **C: Afaan ho’uudhaan** - While language skills are generally helpful, the passage focuses on *behavior* and attitude.
* **D: Amala of gadhiisuu agarsiisuudhaan** - The passage says Parisians are self-interested; showing submissiveness wouldn't be an effective approach.



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa amala Pariisiyaanotaa ta’ee kan itti hin maxxanfamne kami?","Correct answer is **C: Xaxxabachuu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states Parisians are known for being self-serving (not caring about others' benefit) and having a sense of superiority. It also mentions they quickly dismiss anything they deem as not good enough. 

*   **Of tuulummaa** (A) - The passage directly mentions this as a characteristic.
*   **namaaf dantaa kan hin qabne** (B) - The passage directly mentions this as a characteristic.
*   **Ariifachuu** (D) - Being dismissive of things they don't like can be interpreted as a form of snobbery, which aligns with the described attitude.
*   **Xaxxabachuu** (C) - The passage doesn't mention Parisians being overly talkative or gossipy.

Therefore, **Xaxxabachuu (gossiping)** is the one characteristic *not* attributed to Parisians in the given text."
Faayidaan kutaa tokkoffaa baabura magaalaa Keeptaawon maali?,"Correct answer: **B: Namni hagas mara hin baay’atu**

Here's why:

The text states ""Meetiroopilaasin irra caalaatti mijataa fi xiqqoo qofa muddamaadha garuu haala xiqqaan qaala’aadha"" which translates to ""Meetropilas is more comfortable and less crowded, but slightly more expensive.""  This directly implies the benefit of the first section (Meetropilas) is that it's **not crowded** (Namni hagas mara hin baay’atu).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bakki taa’umsaa fuuldura baaburichaatti argama** - The text doesn't mention the boarding location.
*   **C: Tikeetii kutaa sadaffaa gaditti rakasa dha** - The text says the opposite, tickets for the third section (Meetroo) are more expensive.
*   **D: Tikeetii meetroo wajjin gatiin isaa walfakkaataa dha** - The text says it's *slightly more expensive*.



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Baaburoonnii deddeebi’oon Keeppi Taawon hundumtuu maal qabu?","The correct answer is **D: Bakka taa’umsaa kutaa tokkoffaa fi kutaa sadaffaa lamaanuu** (Stopping places for both the first and third sections).

Here's why:

* The text states that all Daandiin Baaburaa Meetroo in and around Keeptaawon have both Meetiroopilaas (Section 1) and Meetiroo (Section 3). This means every train stops at stations for *both* sections.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bakka taa’umsaa badaa walitti hintuutamne** (Different stopping places) - The text doesn’t suggest stopping places are different.
* **B: Gatii tikkeetii walfakkaataa sadarkaa lamaaniif** (Similar ticket prices for two levels) - The text mentions ticket prices but doesn't say they are similar. It only says the Meetiroo ticket is expensive compared to Europe.
* **C: Kutaa garaagaraa sadii** (Three different sections) - The text only mentions two sections: Meetiroopilaas (1) and Meetiroo (3).

Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa bineensotni nama miidhan maal hin godhan?,"Correct answer is **D: Miidhama humna cimaan geessisuu**.

Here's why:

The passage states that dangerous insects can ""humnaan nama miidhuu yookaan nama ajjeesuu danda’an"" (harm people with force or kill them).  The other options (rifaatuu qaamaa fiduu - causing physical discomfort, alerjii fiduu - causing allergies, dhibee daddabarsuu - spreading disease) are mentioned as *potential* effects, but not the core way dangerous insects *directly* harm people. The most severe harm they inflict is through direct physical impact/force.



"
Kaarddiiwwan bilbilaa kaffaltii duraa eessaatii bitamuu danda’u?,"The correct answer is **A: Biyyoota murtaa’aniif** (For specific countries).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yeroo kaardiiwwan hedduun iddoo hunda bilbiluuf gaarii ta’anitti tokko tokko garee biyyoota murtaa’aniitiif dhiheessa bilbila addaa qaba."" (When many cards are good for bilbila everywhere, some have an exclusive bilbila for specific countries).

This directly indicates that some cards are only valid/available in certain countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dhaabbata baaburaatti** (At a car dealership) - The passage doesn't mention dealerships.
* **C: Suuqiiwwan fiixee irratti argamanitti** (In fixed-price markets) - The passage doesn’t mention this type of market.
* **D: Bakka tajaajilli bilbilaa kaffaltiidhaan kennamutti** (Where car bilbila services are provided) - While related to bilbila, the passage is specifically about *where the cards themselves are obtained,* not where the bilbila service is used.



"
Tajaajilli kaffaltii fooyya’aa kaardiiwwan tokko tokkoon kennamu akkamitti argamuu danda’a?,"The correct answer is **B: Karaa bilbiloota gatii malee kennanii**.

The passage states: ""Tajaajiloota kanniin argachuun kan danda’amu yeroo hedduu karaa lakkoofsa bilbilaa gatii bilisaa isa bilbila harka caalaa isaa irraa gatii malee bilbilamuuti.""  This directly translates to ""These services are often obtained through free phone numbers, faster than calling the standard phone number.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Biyyoota murtaa’an qofaattii argachuun danda’ama** (Only available in specific countries) - While the passage mentions some cards are specific to countries, it doesn't say the *service* is only available there.
*   **C: Kuusaa fiixee irratti argamutti** (Found on a fixed coupon) - The passage doesn’t mention coupons.
*   **D: Bilbilaa kaffaltii fayyadamuun kaffaltii dabalataa raawwachuudhaan** (By making additional payments using a paid phone call) - This is the opposite of what the passage says – it suggests avoiding paid calls.

Bineensota darbanii darbanii argaman armaan gadii keessaa paarkii biyyaalessaa Hara Piliitvaayisitti kan argamu kami?,"The correct answer is **B: Adurree daggalaa**.

The passage specifically mentions ""adurree daggalaa eegee cocorree"" as being found in Hara Piliitvaayis National Park. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Turkii** - The passage doesn't mention Turkey.
*   **C: Adalaa** - While listed, it's one of many types of birds found there, not a primary focus like *Adurree daggalaa*.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Koodiin naannoo maaliif fayyadu?","The correct answer is **B: To’annaa gabaaf (For profit/gains)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dhimmi inni guddaan Kaampanoota kana akka isaan gabaa isaanii to’atan gochuu dha; wantichi mallaquma naanneessuudha.""  This translates to: ""The main issue is to make these companies profit; that is cost-effective.""

The passage explicitly links Koodiin's actions to increasing company profits.  While Koodiin *can* operate outside the law (D), the passage frames this as a *means* to the *end* of profit.  The other options (A & C) aren't mentioned as benefits of Koodiin's actions.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""koodiin naannoo galagalcha seeraan alaa keessatti qooda hin qabu"" which translates to ""the code does not participate in illegal dissemination.""  The passage is discussing how companies are falsely claiming the code is for preventing illegal dissemination to justify their existence and potentially profit. Therefore, the core issue being addressed related to the code is **preventing illegal dissemination** – but the companies are falsely claiming it *does* do that.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: To’annaa gabaa caalaattii argachuuf dirqama barbaachisu** (Requirement to get higher profits) - While the passage mentions profits (""gabaa isaanii to’atan"") it doesn't say the code *requires* higher profits. It says the companies are *using* the code as a pretext to increase profits.
* **C: Bu’aa buufachuuf ni fayyadu** (It can be used to achieve results) - The passage doesn't discuss the code's actual capabilities, only the false claims about it.
* **D: Saamicha darbanii darbanii ittisu** (Repeatedly stopping samples) - This isn't mentioned at all in the passage.

"Yemmuu biyya kee geessu, adeemsa kamtu al-idilee dha?","Correct answer: **D: To’annaa gumurukii**

**Explanation:**

The passage directly states: ""to’annaan gumrukii garuu girdirsaa ta’uu danda’a"" (customs inspection can be strict). It also implies that bringing items into a country involves checking what you're allowed to bring and what you're not, which falls under customs regulations. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sakatta’iinsa godaansaa (Security screening):** While security screening is part of international travel, the passage focuses on what you *can* and *cannot* bring, which is the domain of customs.
*   **B: Meeshaalee galmeessisuu (Declaring items):** Declaring items is *part* of the customs process, but the passage discusses the strictness of the *entire* customs process, not just the declaration itself.
*   **C: Daangaa seeraa meeshaalee (Rules about items):** This refers to the laws themselves, whereas the passage is about the *implementation* of those laws (the inspection process)."
kanneen armaan gadii keessaa yeroo biyya keetti deebitu maal beekuu qabda?,"Correct answer: **C: to’annaan gumurikii jiraachuu akka danda’u**

Here's why:

The prompt (P) directly states: ""to’annaan gumrukii garuu girdirsaa ta’uu danda’a."" (Customs inspection can happen).  This is the most direct and relevant information regarding what you need to know when re-entering the country.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Bakki sakatta’iinsa godaantotaa akka jiraachuu danda’u:** The prompt doesn't mention anything about areas for smugglers.
*   **B: Meeshaa eyyemameen olitti yoo qabaatte galmeessisuu akka qabdu:** While declaring items is generally true, the prompt focuses specifically on customs inspection.
*   **D: Meeshaa ati fidaa jirtu keessaa kan hin eeyyamamne akka jiru:**  The prompt talks about knowing what you *can* and *cannot* bring, but doesn't say anything about undeclared items specifically.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, maaltu yoo baay’ate gaara-yaabdotaaf karaa haaraa sulula Kochamo baruuf gargaara?","The correct answer is **C: Fiixee gaaraa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bantiiwwan mul’annoo **fiixee gaaraa** irraa kanneen qalbii namaa hawwatan dabalatu."" (Translation: ""Including those with fixed rocky formations that attract the human heart."")  It goes on to say that climbers come from all over the world to explore these formations. This directly links the unique ""fiixee gaaraa"" (rock formations) to attracting climbers and opening new routes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ilaalcha (View):** While a view might be nice, it doesn't inherently create new climbing routes.
*   **B: Irra keessa gaaraa (Inside the mountain):** The passage doesn't mention anything about climbing *inside* the mountain.
*   **D: Andaara (Danger):** While climbing can be dangerous, danger itself doesn't *help* climbers find new routes.

"Odeeffannoo kuticha keessaa irratti hundaa’uudhaan, kamtu karaawwan baay’ee Heemisfeera kibbaa uwwisa?","Correct answer: **B: Istaar Alliyaansii**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Istaar Aaliyaansiin baha Paasifikii Kibbaa, Saantiyaagoo de Chiilii irraa hanga Tahiitii, isa kan balali’a Waanwoorlidi LATAM ta’e irraa kan hafe waan hunda waliin ga’a."" 

This means Istaar Alliance covers the most routes in the Southern Hemisphere, connecting Santiago to Tahiti, *except* those covered by LATAM. This implies a broader network than LATAM (option D) and certainly more than specific regions like the South Pacific (option C). It explicitly excludes SkyTeam (option A) from being part of these connections.

Therefore, Istaar Alliance has the widest reach."
Gamtaawwan xiyyaaraa kanneen keessaa karaawwan garba Heemisfeera Kaabaa muraasa uwwisa?,"The correct answer is **A: Istaar Alliyaansii**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Istaar Aaliyaansiin baha Paasifikii Kibbaa, Saantiyaagoo de Chiilii irraa hanga Tahiitii, isa kan balali’a Waanwoorlidi LATAM ta’e irraa kan hafe waan hunda waliin ga’a."" This means Star Alliance connects routes in the Southern Hemisphere *except* those served by LATAM.  It's the only option presented that explicitly has connections within the Southern Hemisphere.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Paasifikii kibbaa:** This is a *region*, not an airline alliance.
* **C: LATAM Waanwoorlidii:** The passage specifically says Star Alliance connects to everywhere *except* LATAM's routes.
* **D: IskaayTiim:** The passage states IskaayTiim doesn't connect with any of the southern hemisphere routes.



"
Dhaabbata daawwachiisaa kamtu Daawwannaa Fiigichaa Adunyaa fiixaan baase?,"The correct answer is **B: Goo Raaniingi Tuursii**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dhaalaan Giloobal Raaningi Tuursi, Goo Raaningi Tuursiin neetworkii darzaanan kan fuulen figaan kan ardii afur keessatti deemu."" This translates to ""Globally, Goo Ranking Tours is a network of dozens of experienced guides covering four major cities.""  This clearly identifies Goo Raaniingi Tuursii as a prominent organization in the world of guided tours.

The other options are locations where tours *take place*, not the organization *providing* the tours:

*   **Fiigicha Kopenhagen (Copenhagen Tours):** A location for tours.
*   **Imala fiiguu Pargiwuu (Paris Tours):** A location for tours.
*   **Imala fiiguu Baarseloonaa (Barcelona Tours):** A location for tours.



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Goo Raaniing Tuursiin Dhaabbatoota bakka fiigicha daawwannaa meeqa walitti qabsiisa?","The correct answer is **A: Afur**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dhaalaan Giloobal Raaningi Tuursi, Goo Raaningi Tuursiin neetworkii darzaanan kan fuulen figaan kan ardii afur keessatti deemu.""  This translates to: ""Through Global Ranking Tours, Goo Ranking Tours operates a network of dozens, focusing on the top four in the ranking.""

Therefore, Goo Ranking Tours is connected to **four** ranking positions/locations.
"
Daawwattoonni Ilaalcha qulqullaa’aa Chitaa yoo barbaadan maal gochuu qabu?,"The correct answer is **C: Binokularsii fayyadamuu** (Using binoculars).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Leencotaa, Cheetawwan fi qeerransi yeroo tokko tokkoo ni qaana’uu fi kan isin caalati isaan arguu dandeessan binokularsiidhani."" This directly translates to ""Leopards, cheetahs and lions are sometimes elusive, and you can spot your favorites with binoculars.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Deemsa daggalaa deemuu** (Going on a short drive) - While safaris *include* drives, the passage doesn't specifically link short drives to seeing cheetahs.
* **B: Bakka micireen itti baay’atu deemuu** (Going where there are many gazelles) - The passage doesn't mention gazelles being relevant to cheetah sightings.
* **D: Konkolaataa qabatanii meeshaalee waaltawaa fayyadamuu** (Taking a car and using photography equipment) - While you might *use* photography equipment, the passage doesn't say it's necessary *to see* cheetahs.



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, daawwattoonni yeroo konkolaataadhaan bakka bineensonni jiraatan deeman, bineensa kam arguu danda’u?","The correct answer is **B: Sattawwaa**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Bineensotni muraasni, kanneen akka **Arbaa fi saatawwa**, gara makiinati siiqun beekamu fi meeshotni sirriin akka sirritti ilaaltan isin dandeessisu."" This means that lions and **sattawwaa (wild dogs/African wild dogs)** are known to approach vehicles, making them likely to be seen by tourists on a safari.

While the passage mentions leencotaa, cheetawwan, and qeerransa, it states they are often seen with binoculars, implying they are more distant and harder to spot from a vehicle.



"
"Akka kutichaatti, Baasii daawwannaa maaltu gadi buusuu danda’a?","Correct answer is **A: Qofaa ofii deemuu**.

Here's why:

The passage states Imalli (the lion) is more likely to attack when alone or with only one companion, *trying to create a false sense of security to lure in more people*.  Therefore, Baasii's best strategy to avoid becoming a target is to **go alone** – minimizing the potential for the lion to be tricked into thinking they are an easy meal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gartuu nama afurii barbaaduu (Looking for a group of five):** This *increases* the risk as the lion is more likely to target smaller groups.
* **C: Nama biraa tokkoo wajjin deemuu (Going with one other person):**  This also makes them more vulnerable according to the passage.
* **D: Gartuu nama ja’aa fi isaan olii barbaaduu (Looking for a group of seven or more):** While a larger group is safer, the passage focuses on the lion's strategy when encountering smaller numbers. The best *defensive* strategy based on the text is avoiding the situation where the lion can utilize its trickery.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, eenyutu kaffaltii daawwanna hundarra gaarii isaa argachuu danda’a?","Correct answer: **A: Daawwattoota konkolaataa harkisuuf fedha qaban**

Here's why:

The passage states the large bus is a scam designed to overcharge people. It only becomes profitable for the operator when enough people pay, but they try to *make* it seem full to convince others to pay a higher price. 

Therefore, the people who benefit the most from this situation are those *running* the scam – the ones trying to get tourists to pay for seats on a supposedly full bus. Option A directly describes these people.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gartuu nama sadii:** This isn't mentioned as particularly benefiting.
* **C: Hiriyoota lama waliin imalan:** They might get a slightly better deal if they contribute to filling the bus, but they are still likely being overcharged.
* **D: Gartuu nama shanii:** The passage mentions the need for 5 people to make the scam work, but doesn't say *they* benefit the most. The operator benefits from their payment.
"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Beekamtii San Firaansiiskoo addunyaaf gahee taphate?","Correct answer: **A: Argama Miidiyaa fii Aartii garaagaraa**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that San Francisco's prominence is built on being a globally recognized tourist destination, and that ""Music, films, literature and widely known culture continually show themselves in the city and its famous landmarks, helping them become known throughout the world."" This directly links its fame to its representation in media and the arts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Meeshaalee qulqullina olaanaan tolfaman:** While the passage mentions high-end hotels and restaurants, this is a *result* of its fame, not the primary reason for it.
*   **C: Garaagarummaa diinagdee:**  The passage notes a diverse economy, but doesn't say this is what makes it famous worldwide.
*   **D: Nyaata-aadaa Eeshiyaa qabaachuu:** This is a feature of San Francisco, but not the main reason it's globally known.

kanneen armaan gadi keessaa akka faayidaa dhaabbilee imalaatti kan hin eeramne kami?,"Correct answer is **A: Dookumentii imalaa saffisaa**.

Here's why:

The text mentions that travel agents can help with obtaining documents like visas *if needed*, but doesn't list it as a core benefit *provided by* the travel agency itself. The agency facilitates access to hotels, transportation, and helps with logistics, but obtaining documentation is presented as a separate need they can assist with, not a standard offering.

Let's look at why the other options are benefits mentioned in the text:

*   **B: Waliigaltee Hoteelaa** – The text explicitly states travel agencies have agreements with hotels.
*   **C: Tajaajila kuuffamaa hunda haammatu** – The text mentions baggage handling and hotel accommodations are included in the services.
*   **D: Dursa qabachuu** – The text mentions travel agencies can secure preferential rates and reservations.

Therefore, getting travel documents quickly (Dookumentii imalaa saffisaa) is not a standard benefit offered by the travel agencies, even though they can help with it."

The passage explicitly states: ""...amma hiikaa hedduu yookiin muraasa sirrii kennuu (fi kan wal hin fakkane muraasa), garuu ammayu sirritti ilaalamu qabu, ammayuu sababa dogogora jiraachu danda’aniif."" This translates to ""They can give many or few correct translations (and different ones), but it must always be looked at carefully, as it can be the cause of errors.""

This means real-time translation apps are *not* always 100% accurate. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mallattoolee afaan biyya biroo hiikuu** - The passage states these apps can translate foreign languages.
*   **B: Guutummaa barreeffamaa hiikuu** - The passage says these apps translate complete texts.
*   **C: Bilbila Ismaartiidhaan barreeffama wantoota irra jiru hiikuu** - The passage mentions using a smartphone camera to translate objects.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""erga daataa afaan barbaadamuu buufatanii booda interneeta malee hiika argachuu dandeessisa"" (after downloading the required language data, it can provide translation even without the internet). This capability is a feature *within* real-time translation applications.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Meeshotni afaan hiikuu fooyya’oo** (New translation tools) - Too general. The passage doesn't highlight newness, but the *ability* to work offline.
* **B: Bilbila Ismaartii** (Smartphones) - Smartphones are the *device* used, not the reason for offline translation.
* **C: Oddeeffannoo afaanii buusachuu** (Language data download) -  Downloading data is *how* offline translation is possible, but it's not the thing that *enables* it - the applications do.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa bugugii cabbiif kakaasaa kan hin taane kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Ifa Aduu**.

Here's why:

The passage describes things that can *become* rain:

*   **Cabbii walharkisuuf** (Things related to clouds) - This directly relates to forming rain.
*   **Namoota** (People) - The passage states ""yeroo hundaa nama"" (always people) can become rain, referring to the cycle of life and return to nature.
*   **Rooba cabbii dabalataa** (Additional rain) - This is rain itself becoming more rain.

**Ifa Aduu** (The Earth/World) is not something that transforms *into* rain. It's where the rain falls *on*.

Therefore, Ifa Aduu is the only option that doesn't fit the pattern of things that can be a source/component of rain according to the passage.



"
"Akka kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa akka bugugii cabbiitti kan dhufu kami dha?","The correct answer is **A: Cabbii wal qabataa hin dhiibamne** (Unreleased cabin pressure).

Here's why:

The passage describes a cabin pressure issue:

*   ""Cabbiin kan hin baratamnee miti"" - The cabin is not properly pressurized.
*   ""Rakkoon isaa sababa cabbiin walqabatee walharkisuufi"" - The problem is related to cabin pressure.
*   The description of pressure decreasing (""hammi guddaan akka cabbiitti gadi dhufuu danda’a"") and potentially being harmful (""ceesistuu ta’uu danda’a"") all point to a pressure issue.
*   The passage mentions fluctuations in pressure – sometimes increasing, sometimes decreasing.

Therefore, an unreleased cabin pressure (A) is the most direct interpretation of the ""bugugii cabbiitti"" (pressure issue) described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Irraan gadee cimaa cabbii hin qabne** – This refers to a high altitude with no cabin pressure, which isn't the core *issue* described, but rather a consequence. The issue is the *failure* to maintain pressure.
*   **C: Cabbii baay’ee irraan gadee cimaa irraa** – This is similar to B, talking about the situation *resulting* from the problem, not the problem itself.
*   **D: Cabbii namaan itti hin bu’amiin hafan** – This is about faulty equipment rather than the pressure problem itself.

"Akka kutichaatti, Kaariin mi’a dheedhii kamiin qophaa’a?","The correct answer is **B: Baalaa fi mi’eessituu** (Baala and mi’eessituu).

Here's why:

The passage states the kaariin (card) is ""based on baala qofaafi mi’eessituuwwan"" (baala only and mi’eessituu). While other materials like animal skin/muscle, coconut oil, and water are *used in different variations* of the kaariin, the core foundation is baala and mi’eessituu.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Itittuu fi bishaan** (Scent and water) - These are used in some variations but aren't the fundamental components.
*   **C: Aannan Kokonaatii fi Foon** (Coconut oil and skin) - These are specific to certain regions and are additions, not the base.
*   **D: Muduraa fi Aannan** (Muscle and oil) - Similar to C, these are regional variations and additions.

The text states: ""...gara Kibbai Hindiifi naannolee qarqara bishaanii biro qaama ardichaatti i, **aannan kokonatii baay'inaan fayyadamu**."" ( ...in parts of coastal India and other coastal areas, **coconut oil is used extensively**.)

And earlier it says the cards are ""...waliin walitti makamuudhaan **muduraa**"" (...made with **muduraa/skin**). 

Therefore, coconut oil is used extensively in areas where the cards are made *with skin*.

Here's why:

The passage states that the long journey up to the Transantarctic Mountains is necessary ""to avoid the often congested MakMurdo Ice Shelf."" This directly explains why going over the mountains is preferable to the route along the Ross Ice Shelf.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Cabbiin walitti qabate balaafamaa waan ta’eef** (Because the congested road is dangerous) - While the passage mentions the road is congested, it doesn’t say it's *dangerous*. Congestion is the problem, not inherent danger.
* **C: Konkolaattonni addaa waan ariifatoo hin taaneef** (Because it's difficult to identify different vehicles) - The passage discusses different types of vehicles but doesn't suggest difficulty in identifying them.
* **D: Karaa galaana Roozii imaluu caalaa salphaa dha** (Because it is easier than traveling along the Ross Ice Shelf) - The passage indicates the mountain route is *longer* and more difficult, not easier.

"Karaa kallattii Kaabaatiin, maaltu alaabaadhaan milikkiteeffame?","The correct answer is **C: Lafa baqaqaa cabiidhaan guutame**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Cabbii walitti galedha kan baqaqaa bal’aan isaa alaabaadhaan guutamee mallattoo ittiin godhame."" This directly translates to ""The road is covered with a wide area of sand filled with ballast and marked with signs.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Faana buufata Maakmuurdaotti** - This refers to the MaakMuurdao area, not something filled with ballast.
*   **B: Konkolaattota boba’aa guuran** - This refers to passing trucks, not something *filled* with ballast.
*   **D: Marsaawwan balaafamoo naannoo gaariichaa** - This refers to damaged sections near the garage, and doesn't mention ballast.

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states:** ""Afriikaa kibbaa konkoolaataan galuun bareedina naannolee fi daandii daawwattootaan baratamoo ta’an ala jiran ilaaluuf karaa dinqisiisaa dha."" This means venturing *off the beaten path* (outside of established tourist areas) with a vehicle is challenging. The passage doesn't suggest it's a *good* way to travel, but rather a challenging one.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Biyyoonni baay’een ulaagaa viizaa garaagaraa qabu** - The passage *does* mention visa requirements vary by country.
*   **C: Guutummaa guutuutti hamma jechuun danda’amutti biyyoonni ollee Afriika Kibbaatasgabbaa’oo dha** - The passage specifically states it's not suitable for many countries, not just South Africa.
*   **D: konkolaataadhaan imaluuf yoo ta’e, 4x4tu gorfama** - The passage explicitly recommends a 4x4 vehicle for traveling in Southern Africa.



"
"Akka kutichaatti, Daawwattoota Afriikaa Kibbaa konkolaataadhaan habuuruuf yaadaniif akka gorsa gadheetti kan ilaalamu kami?","Correct answer: **B: 4x4n kan gorfamu utuu ta’ee jiruu, naannooleen tokko tokko konkolaattota kaaniif ni danda’ama**

* **The passage states:** ""Kunis kan godhamu danda’u makiina nagaa keessatti karoora sirriitin garuu 4x4 kan baayee gorfamuu dha fi bakkotni hedduun kan isaan dhaqabaman makiinota gooma ol ka’oo qaban 4x4’ni."" This directly supports the idea that 4x4s are highly recommended, *but* some areas can be accessed with regular vehicles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Meeshaaleen balaa dingataa muraasni seeraan irraa barbaadamuu danda’u** - While the passage mentions safety equipment requirements vary by country, it doesn't focus *on* those requirements as the primary advice.
* **C: Namoota karaa beekame irraan ala ta’e barbaadaniif, konkolaataadhaan imaluun gaarii dha** - The passage doesn’t mention anything about traveling off the beaten path or appealing to adventure seekers.
* **D: Biyyoonni ollaa Afriikaa Kibbaa hundumtuu daawwannaaf ni mijatu jechuun hin danda’amu** - The passage states that other countries are *not* necessarily as accessible as South Africa, implying they aren’t all suitable for travel, but doesn’t make that the main takeaway.

The passage explicitly states: ""Beekumsa kee malee baattuu qorichaa sammuu adoochuu taatee itti fayyadamamuu dandeessa, kun immoo rakkoo cimaa keessa si buusa."" This translates to ""Without your knowledge, your data can be used to train AI models, which can put you in serious trouble."" This is a direct warning about the danger of your data being used unknowingly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hatamuu danda’u** - (Can be stolen) While data theft is a risk, the passage focuses more on *how* the stolen data is used (training AI) rather than just the theft itself.
*   **C: Kan nama biraa wajjin wal wallaalchisuu danda’a** - (Can associate you with other people)  This isn’t a primary concern highlighted in the passage.
*   **D: Abbootiin taayitaa akka meeshaa dhuka’uu ta’uu danda’utti ilaaluu malu** - (Should be viewed as tools of oppression) The passage mentions leaders being targeted, but it doesn’t state that's a primary danger to *you* if your data is compromised.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Korojoowwan hin dhihaatin hannaaf saaxilamanii abbootii taayitaa jalaa xiyyeeffannoo soda dhookuu hawwatan."" This means even if you don't share the information, leaders may still try to extract it from you.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A:** The passage *does* mention the possibility of the death penalty as a first-time offense in some countries.
    * **B:** The passage *does* emphasize the need for extra caution during global crises.
    * **C:** The passage *specifically warns* about people using the information without knowing the source.

Therefore, option D is the only piece of information *not* explicitly covered in the text."
Gosa dhugaatii kamtu yeroo boqonnaa mana ofiittii akka yaalaniif hin eeramne?,"The correct answer is **C: Biiraa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gaafa manati Ayyaana dabarsitu, yeroo sirritti of kunuunsu ni argata akkasumaas waan adda tokko hojjechuuf daqiiqa muraasa dabalatan fudhata.

Yoo biyyaa haali dhugaatii itti adda addaa ta’ee keessa jiraata ta’e, gara barii dhaqi yookiin pabi ollakee yeroo hedduu hin deemne.""

This implies that *cuunfaa* (likely referring to a simple meal) is an option when someone is busy and needs something quick.  The passage also specifically mentions *buna* (coffee) and *shaayii* (tea) as part of the routine. *Biiraa* (beer) isn't mentioned and would be less likely to be a ""quick meal"" option at home.

This translates to: ""If you are feeling adventurous, you may encounter a lottery or a variety of markets.""  The question asks what you should look for in your hometown if it's known for a food culture.  A lottery/market fits the description of something to look for when seeking a unique experience.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Suuqii bunaa ollaa keerraa fagoo:** (A far-off coffee market) - The passage mentions enjoying coffee at home, but doesn’t suggest specifically seeking a distant coffee market.
*   **C: Pabii yeroo hedduu hin deemne:** (A rarely visited pub) - The passage mentions *avoiding* pubs if the food situation is different in another country.
*   **D: Mana nyaataa shaayii baay’ee mi’aawaa qopheessan:** (A very sweet tea restaurant) - While the passage mentions enjoying tea, it doesn’t recommend seeking out a specific restaurant known for sweet tea.



"
Siidaan gugee eessatti argama?,"The correct answer is **A: Sa’aatii walakkaa badiyyicha irraa**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Gandattii nama kakaastu kana keessa naanna’uun naannoo walakkaa sa’atii namatti fudhata."" This translates to ""Navigating this terrifying forest takes about an hour from the nearest village.""  Therefore, the village (sa'atii walakkaa) is where you find the ""siidaan gugee"" (the starting point/location referenced in the question).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mooraa mana amantaa keessa (Inside the church gate)** - The passage doesn't mention a church.
* **C: Odola Listiraayi (Listraayi's blood)** - While the passage mentions Listraayi's blood, it's a feature *of* the forest, not where the starting point is.
* **D: Mana qulqullummaa keessa (Inside the sanctuary)** - The passage doesn't mention a sanctuary.



"
Viisaa gosa kamtu namni tokko qarshii gahaa qabaachuu isaa ragaa akka dhiheessuuf gaafata?,"The correct answer is **D: Viisaa barataa**.

The text states: ""Biyyoota harka caalaniif, dhaabbata itti barachuu barbaadde irraa xalayaa afeerraa kan si barbaachisuu fi kana malees ragaa deeggarsa maallaqaa kan yoo xiqqaateef wagga jalqabaa koorsii keetiitiif ittiin of deeggartu si barbaachisa."" This directly translates to: ""For popular countries, you may need a letter of acceptance from the institution you want to study at, and also proof of financial support for at least the first year of your course.""  This is a requirement for student visas.



"
Eenyutu viisaan yeroo dheeraaf isa barbaachisuu danda’a?,"The correct answer is **C: Barataa Idil-addunyaa (International Student)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Walumaagalatti, biyya alaa kam keessa iyyuu yeroo dheeraaf turuuf dursitee viizaa argachuu si barbaachisa. Viizaan barattootaa..."" (In any country, you need a visa to stay for a long time. Student visas...)

The passage also contrasts being a tourist with being an international student, noting that the latter requires a longer stay and therefore a visa. The other options are mentioned in the passage, but they are related to *types* of visas, not *who* needs a long-term visa.



"
Yeroo kam waa’ee bookee addatti qalbeeffachuu qabda?,"Correct answer is **A: Yeroo Bonaa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Bona keessa, keessattuu, yoo bosona keessa miilla diriifachuuf murteessite bookee irraa of eeggachuu si barbaachisa.""  This translates to ""Inside Bona, especially, if you decide to stretch your legs inside the forest, you need to protect yourself from the book.""  This directly links the need to be careful of the book to being *in Bona*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Deemsa irratti (On the road):** The passage doesn't mention any specific danger on the road.
*   **C: Bosona roobaa keessatti (In the rain forest):** While the passage mentions the rain forest, the initial warning is specifically about Bona.
*   **D: Yeroo konkolaataa oofan (When leaving the car):** The passage mentions being careful when exiting the car, but the primary warning focuses on being in Bona.



"
"Akka kutichaatti, yeroo bosona roobaa keessa konkolaataa ooftu, buukee ittisuudhaaf maal gochuu irraa of qusachuu qabda?","The correct answer is **A: Balbala konkolaataa yeroo dheeraaf bananii tursuu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that leaving the car door open for too long invites bookees (thieves) to enter the car. The warning is about preventing theft while in a busy, potentially unsafe area (the bus station).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Yeroo bonaa keessa oofuu** - Being *in* the car doesn't prevent theft, it just means you're present while it happens.
*   **C: Naannoo cita tirooppikii ta’an keessa oofuu** - Being near the ticket office doesn't affect the risk of theft.
*   **D: Yeroo deemsa miillaanii, konkolaataaf xiyyeeffannoo kennuu dhiisuu** - Losing focus on your belongings *increases* the risk of theft, it doesn't help prevent it.



"
"Akka kutichaatti, Himoota armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee Sandaarbaanii dhugaa kan hin taane kami?","Correct answer is **D: Qeerrensa Beengaali caalaa bakka argama Bosonuu tuqaa qabuuti**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""amma qeerransoota Rooyaal Beengaalii 400’tu jira jedhamee shakkama"" (approximately 400 Royal Bengal tigers are believed to live there). This implies the presence of Royal Bengal tigers, but doesn't suggest it has a *higher* concentration than other areas.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the text:

*   **A: Bosonoota dandamachuu danda’an muraasa jran bakka bu’a:** The text mentions ""hafteewwan daggala guddaa dhaabatanii jiran warra dhumaa, kanneen yeroo tokko bakkee diriiraa Gaajet haguuganii turan muraasa of keessatti hammatu"" which translates to the existence of remnants of large, old trees which once protected the historic Gadget forests.
*   **B: Walakkaan iddoo isaa lafa caffeedhaan kan uwwifame dha:** The text says ""mukkeen sunniin caffee mangiroov qofa miti"" meaning it is not solely mangrove forest, but includes coffee.
*   **C: Bakka argama mangiroov guddicha addunyaa kanaati:** The text states, ""Saandarbaan muka guddaa qarqaraa hidha bishaanii addunyaa kanaati"" which translates to Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world.



"
Kutaa bosonichaa kamtu daangaa Hindii keessa oola?,"Correct answer is **A: Paarkii biyyoolessaa Sandaarbaan**.

The text states: ""Gariin bosona isaa daangaa Indiyaa keessa oolu Paarkii Biyyaalessaa Sandarbaansi jedhama."" This directly translates to ""Part of its forest falls within the territory of India, called Sundarban National Park.""
"
"Akka kutichaatti, Eenyutu yoo xinnaate hubannoo afaan Ingilizii daanga’aa ta’ee qabaachuu danda’a?","The correct answer is **D: Namoota ga’eessa (Experienced people)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Biyyoonni addunyaa baayyeen afaan ingiliiziii sirriitti dubbatu, baayyee beekumsa murtawaa illee isaanirraa eeguu dandeessa namoota ga’eessa irraa iyyuu.""  This translates to: ""Many countries in the world speak English well, but even experienced people can protect valuable information from them.""

The passage implies that even those with fluency in English (which many countries have) can be outsmarted by experienced individuals who possess deeper knowledge and understanding. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nama yoo xiqqaate afaa biroo lama haasa’u (Someone who speaks at least two other languages):** While multilingualism is valuable, the passage doesn't link it to being able to overcome English speakers.
* **B: Namoota umurii gara ijoollee (People of a young age):** Age isn't the key factor discussed in the passage.
* **C: Namoota gara Torontootti imalan (People who move to Toronto):** The Toronto example is just an illustration, not a source of a protective advantage.



"
"Akka kutichaatti, Sagaleessuuf kamtu cimuu danda’a?","The correct answer is **B: Teessoo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kun keessattuu teessoowwan, kanneen haala hundi hubatuun sagaleessuuf yeroo hedduu namatti ulfaataniif dhugaadha."" This directly translates to ""Especially accents, which are often frustrating for people to understand in all circumstances, is true."" 

The passage specifically mentions that accents can make it difficult to understand what someone is saying. The example then illustrates a group of people with different accents (Mankuwaniyan, Bostonian, Jamaican, etc.) communicating and potentially struggling to understand each other.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jechoota loqoda adda biraa keessa jiran (Different words within the language):** While different vocabulary can cause misunderstandings, the passage focuses on *how* things are said, not *what* is said.
*   **C: Jechoota barreeffaman (Written words):** The passage states that written words are *easier* to understand than spoken words.
*   **D: Haasaa malaa naannoo (Local slang):**  While slang can be a barrier, the passage specifically highlights the difficulty caused by *accents* and how they impact comprehension.



"
"Akka kutichaatti, imalaa baasii buufata qaxxaamuraa qabachu karoorsuuff haala kamtu filatamaa dha?","Correct answer: **A: Imalaa gara Jaakar deemuu fi tikeetee dursee kan bitate**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Baasonni gara naannoo ollaatti imalan buufataa baasii irraa...Jaakar/Bamtaangi deeman sa’aa 06:30 fi 07:30 ti dha."" (Buses to the surrounding areas leave from the bus station...departing for Jaakar/Bamtaangi at 6:30 and 7:30).
* **The text also states:** ""Awutoobusiin qaxxaamuraa waan yeroo hundaa guutaniif guyyaa muraasa dursanii tikeeta murachuun ni gorfama."" (Because buses are often full, it is recommended to buy tickets a few days in advance).

Option A directly reflects this information - going to Jaakar and buying a ticket in advance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While Bamtaangi is mentioned, the text doesn't specify *having* to leave at 7:00.
* **C:** Paaroo and Puunaakaa are taxi stands, not bus destinations, and the text doesn't mention leaving after 11:00.
* **D:** The text doesn't mention leaving for ""bahaa"" (the beach) and states buses leave *at* 6:30 and 7:30, not before 6:20.



"
Daawwataa buufata baasii qaxxaamuraa gara bahaatti imaluuf odeeffannoon gaarii ta’e kami?,"Correct answer is **B: Tikeetii dursanii bitachuu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**Awutoobusiin qaxxaamuraa waan yeroo hundaa guutaniif guyyaa muraasa dursanii tikeeta murachuun ni gorfama.**"" (Because buses are often full, it is recommended to buy tickets a few days in advance.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baasonni sa’atii 8:30 booda qofa ba’u** - The passage says buses leave between 6:30 and 7:30 am.
*   **C: Guyyaa guutuu baasota baay’eetu ba’a** - While it states buses are often full, it doesn't guarantee they'll be full all day.
*   **D: Taaksiin kiraa waliinii mala imala fooyya’aa ta’uu danda’a** - The passage mentions taxis as an alternative, but doesn't say they're *always* a good option. It only mentions they can help with remote locations.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessa ibsa Timbuuktuu sirrii kan hin taane kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Xiyyaaraan deemuun hin danda’amu** (It is not possible to arrive by airplane).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...akkaasumas buufata xiyyaaraa qabaattus..."" which translates to ""...and also has an airport..."" This directly contradicts option C.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: Biyyoota biraa caalaa dhiibbaa Arabaa qaba** (It has a stronger Arab influence than other countries) - The text states ""sababnisaas inni baay’inaan kan Araabota qaba kan Afriikanoota caalaa"" which means it has more Arabs than Africans.
*   **B: Hiyyummaa hamaadhaan kan miidhamte** (It was damaged by severe drought) - The text mentions it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger due to conflict in 1990. While not specifically drought, it was added due to a damaging situation.
*   **D: Daawwattoota beekuuf hedduu barbaadaniif bakka hawwataa dha** (It is an attractive place for tourists who want to know it) - The text says ""Maqaan isii bakka hawwata tuuristii isii taasisus..."" which means its name makes it an attractive tourist destination.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee Timbuuktuu kamtu dhugaa dha?,"The correct answer is **A: Xiyyaaraan magaalittii deemuun ni danda’ama** (Airplanes can land in the city).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""akkasumas buufata xiyyaaraa qabaattus..."" which translates to ""...and also has an airport..."" This directly supports the statement that airplanes can land in Timbuktu.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hiyyummaa caalaa waan nama hawwatu hedduu qabu** (It has many things that attract people more than beauty): The text says it's a desired tourist destination (""maqaan isii bakka hawwata tuuristii isii taasisus"") but doesn't compare it to beauty or say it has *more* attractive things than beauty.
* **C: Magaalota naannoo gaditti Aadaa Afrikaanummaa qabu** (It has African cultural traditions like neighboring cities): The text specifically mentions Timbuktu has a strong Arab influence (""baay’inaan kan Araabota qaba kan Afriikanoota caalaa""), making this incorrect.
* **D: Magaalittiin daawwattoota hawwachaa hin jirtu** (The city does not have desirable visitors): The text explicitly states it *is* a desired tourist destination.



"
Olompiikiin gannaa yoomitti sagantaan isaa qabame? ,"The correct answer is **A: Hagayya 2021**.

The text states: ""Paaraalimpiksii kan gaggeeffamu Hagayyaa 24 hanga Fulbaana 5 2021’ti."" (The Paralympics were held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021).  Hagayya is August.

"Akka kutichaatti, yeroo kam obomboleettiin gara Toorneedootti jijjiirama?","The correct answer is **A: Yeroo bubbeen saffisa naannoo sa’aatiitti maayelii 100 ga’u** (When the wind speed reaches 100 miles per hour).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Bubbee guddaa gad dhiisu (yeroo hedduu sa’atiitti maayelii 100-200)..."" (Strong winds are released (often 100-200 miles per hour)...). This directly links the high wind speed to the formation of tornadoes (""toornaadoowwan"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Yeroo utubaan qilleensaa naanna’uu eegalu** (When the tube starts to form in the cloud): While cloud formation is *part* of the process, it's not the defining moment of transformation.
*   **C: Yeroo duumeessa qilleensa bubbee makaterraa bu’uu** (When cloud condensation starts to fall): This describes precipitation, not the critical speed threshold.
*   **D: Erga lafa tuqee** (After touching the ground):  Tornadoes are *identified* when they touch the ground, but they *form* before that point, triggered by the wind speed.



"
Kanneen keessaa kamtu amala Toorneedoo sirrii dha?,"The correct answer is **D: Utubaa qilleensa naanna’au kan qilleensa gara bakkeetti dhiibu dha** (It is a funnel-shaped cloud that brings air down from the atmosphere).

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""Toorneedoon utubaa qilleensa naanna’uu kan qilleensa dhiibbaan isaa baay’ee gad aanaa ta’ee..."" This translates to ""A tornado is a funnel-shaped cloud that brings air down from the atmosphere...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yeroo hundumaa bubbee saffisa sa’atiitti maayelii 100-200tti kennu** (Always producing wind at speeds of 100-200 mph) - While tornadoes *often* have high winds, it's not a defining characteristic stated as universally true in the passage.
* **B: Yeroo baay’ee wantoota ulfaatoo sochoosu** (Often lifting up debris) - The passage mentions debris being lifted, but it's a *result* of the tornado, not its primary definition.
* **C: Yeroo lafa tuqan obomboleettii ta’u** (Turning into a mushroom when they touch the ground) - The passage describes them as becoming ""toornaadoowwan"" (tornadoes) when they touch the ground, not specifically mushrooms. This is a misleading simplification.



"
"Akka kutichaatti, daawwattoonni waa’ee tasgabbaa’iinsa siyaasaa biyya deemanii ilaalchisee eessaatii gorsa fudhachuu qabu?","The correct answer is **B: Ilaalcha gorsaa imalaatiin dhiyaaterraa** (From sources of advice that come from practical experience).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that advice should be tailored to the specific situation and *not* just broad governmental recommendations. It points out that issues faced by people in the Midwest US might be different from those in Europe or Arab countries.  It also criticizes the superficial nature of many political analyses.

* **A: Mootummaa biyya daawwachuuf deemanii irraa** (From the government of the country being visited) - The passage suggests governmental advice is often too general and not tailored to individual needs.
* **C: Lammiilee biyya daawwachuuf deemanii irraa** (From citizens of the country being visited) - While helpful, this isn't the focus. The passage speaks to *informed* advice.
* **D: Mootummaa mataa isaanii irraa** (From their own government) - The passage implies a need to look *beyond* what their own government suggests.

The passage advocates for advice based on *practical experience* (gorsaa imalaatiin dhiyaaterraa) because it's more likely to be relevant and useful.  This means seeking advice from people who have dealt with similar situations, not just relying on generalized governmental recommendations.



"
"Taatee gorsa imalaa keessatti, lammiin alaa maal muuxannoo godhachuu dhiisuu danda’a?","The correct answer is **A: Haqamuu inshuraansii dhiibbaan irra ga’e** (Loss of insurance coverage).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that taking on the risk of self-insurance (going without insurance) is a consequence of choosing to take advice that isn't tailored to your specific situation. It mentions both health and property insurance being affected.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Haala siyaasa biyya sanaa ilaalchisee gudunfama baay’ee salphatee qophaa’e** (A very simplified understanding of the country's political situation) - While the passage *mentions* simplified advice, it's not the direct consequence of choosing that advice.
* **C: Inshuraansii fayyaa dhiibbaan irra ga’e** (Loss of health insurance coverage) - This is *part* of the problem, but the passage includes property insurance as well, making A a more comprehensive answer.
* **D: Haala siyaasa biyya sanaa ilaalchisee odeeffannoo gadi fagoo** (Insufficient information about the country's political situation) - This describes the *source* of the bad advice, not the consequence of taking it.

"Akka himichaatti, Imala gosa kamtu carraan galmaa’uudhaaf gargaarsa Ejensootaa barbaaduu isaa gadi aanaa dha?","Correct answer: **D: Imalaaf imala jalqabaa kan biyya alaa**

Here's why:

The passage states that agencies are a good choice for projects that are ""larger than previous work on a subject, culture, language, or smaller countries."" This directly relates to a first-time project in a foreign country. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Imala walga’ii hojii gara biyya imalaan sun kanaan dura deemee turee** - The passage suggests agencies are good for *new* challenges, not repeating existing work.
*   **B: Imala torban lamaa baajata baay’ee addatti qophaa’een** - While agencies can handle budgets, the passage doesn't highlight budget size as a primary reason to use them.
*   **C: Imala iddoo itti rakkoon afaanii mudachuu danda’au** - The passage mentions language, but not specifically projects *with* language difficulties. It focuses on projects involving different languages/cultures generally.

"Akka kutichaatti, haala kam keessatti imalaan tajaajila ejensootaa irraa caalaatti fayyadamaa ta’a?","The correct answer is **D: Yeroo imalaan gara naannoo garaagarummaa aadaa jiru beekuu daawwaachuu deemu (When the traveler wants to visit a region with cultural differences)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agencies are a good choice when wanting to *experience something beyond what one has previously done* - specifically mentioning culture, language, or less-visited countries.  Option D directly aligns with this.  A traveler seeking to experience cultural differences would benefit most from an agency's expertise and resources.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Yeroo imalaan daawwannaa biyya isaa dhaqaa galaaf galmaa’u (When the traveler is planning to travel within their own country):**  Agencies are less necessary for domestic travel, as it's easier to plan independently.
* **B: Yeroo imalaan jalqabaaf imala bashannanaa yeroo gabaabaa taasisuuf galmaa’uu fedhu (When the traveler wants to quickly plan a first-time trip):** While agencies *can* help with quick planning, the passage emphasizes deeper experiences, not just speed.
* **C: Yeroo imalaan afaan biyya daawwachuu deemuu seeraan danda’u (When the traveler can legally speak the language of the country they are visiting):**  Language ability doesn't necessarily negate the benefits of an agency, especially for cultural immersion.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that things change when you move to a new place – food is different, customs are different, etc.  It highlights the importance of being open to these differences and adjusting.  Trying new foods (nyaatota kanaan dura hin beekne yaaluuf) directly addresses this point.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Iddoo dhufanii wajjin waanta wal fakkaatu eeguu:** While finding familiar things can be comforting, the passage is about *adjusting to differences*, not clinging to similarities.
*   **C: Seerota biyya dhufaniitti cichuu:** Following rules is important, but the passage focuses more broadly on adapting to the entire culture and way of life.
*   **D: Odeeffannoo waa’ee bakka buufatanii qorachuu dhiisuu:** The passage encourages *being aware* of how people around you do things, not avoiding information.

"Oddeeffannoo kuticha keessaa irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Nama akkamiitu yeroo biyya haaraatti imalu mufachuu danda’a?","Correct answer: **B: Nama jijjiirama fudhachuun itti cimu**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of being prepared for differences in customs, laws, food, transportation, and even how people work when moving to a new place.  Someone who can *easily adapt to change* (jijjiirama fudhachuun itti cimu) will be best equipped to handle these differences and thrive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nama nyaata biyya biroo jaallatu:** While liking new foods is helpful, it's only one small aspect of adjusting to a new culture.
*   **C: Nama waan haaraa baruuf qophii hin taane:** The passage directly states the *need* to be prepared to learn new things and understand differences.
*   **D: Nama waa barachuu jaallatu:**  Enjoying learning is good, but adaptation goes beyond just wanting to learn – it involves accepting and adjusting to different ways of life.

Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa imaltoota biyyoota guddachaa jiran yeroo jalqabaaf daawwataniif hin gorsamu?,"The correct answer is **C: Uffata qorraa fi sireen buufachuuf ni gorfamu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Naannoo bineensota naannawaa jiraatan hin beeknetti firaashii yookan afata furdaa lallaafaa lafarra afattee hin rafiin."" This means *don't* sleep on the ground or with loose bedding because of scorpions and other creatures. Therefore, bringing your own proper bedding (like a sheet or blanket) is advised.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lafa irra ciisuun dura bineensota naannoo sanaa beekuu** - The passage warns *against* sleeping on the ground, not about needing to know the insects beforehand.
* **B: Guyyaa jalqabaadhaan nyaatatti qarshii humnaan olii baasuu dhiisuu** - The passage suggests being mindful of costs (style of the Sixes - hotels, food, service) but doesn't specifically advise against spending money on food on the first day.
* **D: Yeroo jalqabaaf achi geessu hoteela qaaliitti qarshii baasuu** - The passage mentions expensive hotels as an example of cost to be aware of, but doesn't strictly discourage staying in them.

Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa yeroo biyyoota guddachaa jiran deeman maal irratti qarshii dhangalaasuun hin eeramne?,"The correct answer is **C: Boraatii yookiin uffata siree buufachuuf**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Naannoo bineensota naannawaa jiraatan hin beeknetti firaashii yookan afata furdaa lallaafaa lafarra afattee hin rafiin. Yoo bakkeeti mana ijaarate bashananu barbaade, waan uffatu yookiin Hamokii fidadhu kottu kan Bofaa, iskorpiyanii fi wantoota akka Sanaa irra si eegu.""  This directly translates to avoiding sleeping on the ground or using cheap bedding, and instead opting for a mattress or hammock to protect yourself from dangers like scorpions. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nyaata istaayila warra lixaa** - The passage mentions expensive food as something to *consider* when budgeting, but doesn't say it's something to avoid spending money on.
*   **B: Tajaajila qulqullina qabu** - Similar to food, expensive services are mentioned in the context of budgeting, not as things to skip.
*   **D: Hoteela qulqullina qabu** - Expensive hotels are also a budgeting consideration, not something to avoid outright.

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Koppii imaammataa/namoota quunnamamanii namoota waliin imalanii fi firoottanii ykn hiriyoottan biyyaa isaan gargaaruudhaaf fedha qabaniif kenni."" (Give a copy to family members or trusted people you live with who might need to help you.)

The question focuses on someone *without* internet access.  The other options all rely on internet access (email, cloud storage). Giving a physical copy to someone they live with is the only viable option described in the passage for someone without internet.



"
"Akka kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu imaammata irratti hin argamu?","Correct answer is **C: Lakkoofsa bilbiloota idil-addunyaa eeyyema argachuuf gargaaru**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states the insurance document should include contact details *for the insurance company* (international phone number and email) to ask for advice/legal help and to make claims. It does *not* mention including phone numbers to help *someone find* insurance.  The focus is on the insurance provider's contact information, not facilitating finding a new one.

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned in the text:

*   **A: Lakkoofsa bilbiloota Idi-addunyaa odeeffannoo kennuuf taasisuuf** - The text directly says to include the insurance company’s international phone number.
*   **B: Iimeeyilii kennaa tajaajila inshuraansii** - The text states to include the insurance company's email address.
*   **D: Iimeeyilii abbaa imaammataa** - The text mentions keeping a copy and sharing it with family and friends who might need help, implying including the email for assistance.



"
"Akka kutichaatti, foormaatiiwwan fiilmii kamtu baay’inaan hojiirra oola?","The correct answer is **D: Negativa 36 x 24 mm**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Inni yeroo baay’ee dhimma itti ba’amu isa miiliimeetirii 35 baratamaadha (mm 36 mm 24n negatiiva).""  This directly translates to ""It is often the commonly used 35mm format (36mm x 24mm negative).""

While the passage *mentions* 6x6 format, it establishes 35mm as the *most* common. The other options (56x56mm) are less common and presented as specific examples of medium format, not the primary format discussed.
"
kanneen armaan gadii keessaa dandeettii guddisee agarsiisuu DSLR wajjin wal fakkaatu qaba?,"Correct answer: **B: Fiilmii giddu galeessaa**

Here's why:

The passage states that medium format cameras (fiilmii giddu galeessaa) offer quality comparable to modern DSLR cameras. It specifically mentions the 6x6 format (using 56x56mm negatives) provides four times the negative area of 35mm film, leading to higher quality.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fiilmii 35 mm** - The passage notes this is a common format, but doesn't claim it has DSLR-level quality.
*   **C: Fiilmii 56 x 56 mm** - This is a *specific* size within the medium format, not the overarching category that rivals DSLRs.
*   **D: Fiilmii 6 x 6 cm** - This is *also* a specific medium format size, but ""fiilmii giddu galeessaa"" is the broader, more encompassing answer the text is pointing towards."
"Akka kutichaatti, kanneen keessaa tarkaanfii dhumaa imala daldalaa barreessuu jalqabuuti?","The correct answer is **C: Marsariitii mataa kee ijaaruu** (Creating your own Marsariitii).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Erga ati sirreessuu fi bocuu weebii irraatti sirriiti itti quufteebooda, itti aansuudhaan, marsariitii mataa keetii banachuu dandeessa."" (After you correct and thoroughly test the bug on the web, then you can create your own Marsariitii).

This clearly indicates that creating your own *Marsariitii* is the final step in the process of writing the trading algorithm.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bocuu marsaariitii shaakaluu** (Testing the Marsariitii) - This happens *before* creating your own.
*   **B: Keewwata biloogii imala beekamaa baay’ee barreessuu** (Writing a lot of documentation for the known algorithm) - This is an earlier step.
*   **D: Dandeetii gulaallii ofii cimsuu** (Improving your debugging skills) - This is a continuous process, not the final step of this specific task.



"
"Yeroo imala daldalaa barreessuu itti jalqabamu, dandeettii armaan gadii keessaa kamtu dura dhabamsiifamuu qaba?","The correct answer is **B: Boca Marsariitii**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Karaan salphaan imala daldalaa barreessuu ittiin jalqaban, **biloogii marsariitii imala beekamaa irratti dandeettii kee mullisuudhaani.**""  This translates to: ""The easy way to start writing a trading plan is to **demonstrate your ability on a known demo account (simulated trading).**""

Therefore, before starting a real trading plan, you need to show proficiency by **testing/trading on a demo account (boca marsariitii)** first.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ibsa kennuu (Giving Information):** While important generally, it's not the *first* skill needed to start a trading plan.
*   **C: Gulaaluu (Learning):**  Learning is foundational, but comes *before* demonstrating ability.
*   **D: Marsariitii kalaquu (Closing Trades):** This is part of trading, but not the initial skill you need to demonstrate to start planning.



"
Haala qilleensaa gosa kam keessatti dhibeen mar’ummaanii bay’inaan argama?,"The correct answer is **C: Haala qilleensaa ho’aa** (Hot climate conditions).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Akkuma rakkoolee hargansuu qilleensa qorraa keessaa jiranitti, rakkooleen mar’ummaanii qilleensa ho’aa keessaas haalaan jiru..."" which translates to ""Just as there are problems with spoilage in cold climates, problems with marinating in hot climates also exist..."" 

Therefore, the passage explicitly links marinating problems (and thus the disease) to hot climates."
"Akka kutichaatti, Haala idileedhaan saaxilamuun madiinummaa maaliitti geeesa?","Correct answer: **A: Rakkina Mar’ummaanii**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...rakkooleen mar’ummaanii qilleensa ho’aa keessaas haalaan jiru..."" which translates to ""...problems of altitude sickness also exist in hot climates...""  The passage then links this to the dangers faced in these extreme environments. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jarmoota naannoo:** While the passage mentions nearby germs, it doesn't say saaxilamuun (getting sick) leads *to* them.
* **C: Rakkina Hargansuu:** The passage does mention ""rakkoolee hargansuu qilleensa qorraa"" (problems of altitude sickness in cold climates), but the question specifically asks about the consequences of being *saaxilamuun* (sickened).
* **D: Garaa kaasaa imaltootaa:** This option doesn't appear anywhere in the passage.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa faayidaa biyyoota zoonii Shengen keessa imaluu kan ta’e kami?,"Correct answer is **D: Paaspoortiin sirraa barbaadamuu dhiisuu**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hamma zoonii kana keessa turtutti, osoo bakka itti paaspoortii gaafatanitti hin gaafatamiin ammas daangaa darbuu dandeessa."" This directly translates to ""While within the Schengen zone, you may not be asked for your passport and can cross borders without being checked.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Iyyannoo viisaa baay’ee hambisuu** – The text mentions visa requirements *outside* the Schengen zone, not within it.
*   **B: Qarshii qusachuu** – The text mentions costs related to visas, but not specifically within the Schengen zone.
*   **C: Buufata sakatta’iinsa paaspoortii baay’ee hambisuu** – The text actually implies the opposite – less passport control.



"
Bakka awwaalcha Tutankhamunitti kan hin argamne isa kami?,"Correct answer is **A: Faayama muraasa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Qabeenyaan bakkee awwaalaa sana keessa jira jedhamee dubbatamaa ture amma achi keessa hinjiru, garuu gara Muuziyeemii Masir isa Kaayiroo keessaatti geeffamee jira."" This means the contents originally believed to be in the tomb (including valuables) are now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.

The text also mentions the presence of:
*   **Mataa reeffa tursamee** (the mummified body)
*   **Gatiittii reeffa tursamee** (the coffin)
*   **Qaabenya meeshaaleewwanii** (various artifacts/possessions)

However, it specifically states that the ""faayama muraasa"" (golden mask) is *now* in the Cairo Museum, implying it was originally believed to be in the tomb but is no longer there. Therefore, it's the item not currently found in the tomb itself."
"Akka kutichaatti, imaltoota baasii gadi bu’aa barbaadaniif bakkee Vaankover isa kamtu badaa hawwataa hin ta’u? ","Correct answer: **D: Wiisler**

Here's why:

The passage states Wiisler is more expensive and while famous due to the 2010 Olympics, it's a bit of a stretch for a quick, budget-friendly getaway. The passage highlights Bowen Island, Granville Island, and the Howe Sound area as accessible and offering many affordable activities.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Odola Granvil:** The passage says it's an easy way to *reach* Bowen Island.
*   **B: Koriidarii galaanaa:** The passage suggests it's good for outdoor enthusiasts seeking adventure.
*   **C: Ayislaandii Boween:** Described as a perfect spot for day or multi-day trips with many affordable options."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, Daawwattootaaf muuxannoo Vaankooverii isa sirrii bakki kennuu danda’u isa kami?","Correct answer: **A: Ayiislandii Boween**

**Explanation:**

The passage specifically describes Ayiislandiin Boween as a destination for tourists seeking outdoor activities like kayaking, hiking, and dining. It also details how easily accessible it is from Vancouver. The other options are mentioned in the text, but aren't presented as complete tourist destinations in the same way Ayiislandiin Boween is.

*   **Wiisler** is described as more expensive and further away.
*   **Magalalaa walakkaa Vaankooverii** is too broad.
*   **Odola Granvil** is just a transportation point *to* Ayiislandiin Boween."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, Imaltoonni daawwannaa finca’aa dhorkaa malee daawwachuu yoo barbaadan yoom ta’uu qaba?","The correct answer is **D: Waqtii roobaan alatti** (During the dry season).

Here's why:

The passage states that the falls are most dangerous (and potentially engulf you!) during the rainy season (March to October) due to the high water levels.  It implies that to avoid being soaked or swept away, you should visit *outside* of that time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sadaasaa hanga Bitooteessaatti** (March to October) - This is the *rainy* season, the time to avoid.
*   **B: Yeroo wartii daawwannaa** (Peak season) - The passage doesn't mention peak season, only the dangers of the rainy season.
*   **C: Yeroo bishaan ol ka’u** (When the water is high) - This is also during the rainy season, the time to avoid.



"
"Akka kutichaatti, Gaarummaan Viiktooriyaa Foolsii Sadaasaa fi Bitootessa gidduu ji’oota jiran keessa daawwachuu maali?","Correct answer: **A: Finca’aa dhorkaa malee daawwachuu**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that during the rainy season (March to October), the water levels rise and the falls become very powerful. It warns that you need to be careful to avoid getting soaked (""…you'll need a raincoat or get soaked walking near the falls!"") and even suggests the falls could completely engulf you (""…the rising water levels will engulf the right side of the falls—completely!"")

Therefore, the danger of visiting Victoria Falls during those months is the risk of being *soaked by the falls* and having a difficult time viewing them safely.  The phrase ""Finca’aa dhorkaa malee daawwachuu"" (visiting without avoiding the falls) captures that risk.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Daawwattoota muraasa:** The text doesn't say there are fewer tourists.
*   **C: Ilaalcha finca’aa bareedaa:** While the view is powerful, the problem isn't just the view itself, but the danger of getting too close.
*   **D: Waqtii roobaa hambisuu:** The text describes the rainy season, it doesn't suggest trying to avoid it."
"Akka kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa yeroo fiilmiin dirooniidhaan waraabamu kan hin gorfamne kami?","The correct answer is **D: Iddoo walitti tuuta’aa dirooniin itti hin hubatamne qofa waraabuu** (Only filming in places where the drone cannot be seen).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Diroonii naannoo buufata xiyyaaraa bira fi bakkee namni itti baay’attu irra balaliisuun yaada badaa dha, yooma naannoo keessaniitti seeraan ala ta’uu baatellee.""  This translates to ""Flying a drone near airports and crowded areas is a bad idea, and could potentially be illegal in your area.""

Therefore, the only acceptable scenario, according to the passage, is filming *only* in locations where the drone won't be visible to people or interfere with airport operations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waanta waraabuuf siif heyyamame dursa baruu** (Knowing what you are allowed to film first) - While important, the passage focuses on *where* you film, not *what* you film.
*   **B: Heyyama dabalataa argachuu** (Getting additional permission) - The passage mentions needing to clarify permissions, but doesn’t state it’s something *not* to do.
*   **C: Heyyama qorannoo geggeessuu** (Conducting permission research) - Similar to B, this is about getting permission, not avoiding problematic areas.

"Akka kutichaatti, iddoon filatamoo dirooniidhaan waraabuuf ta’an kami?","The correct answer is **B: Naannoo itti suuraan idilee hin eeyyamamne** (Places where illegal pictures cannot be seen).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Yoo suraa wanta tokkoo kaasuun hin hayamamne, itti aansee vidiyoo waraabuuf gonkumaa yaaduu hin qabdu."" (If you cannot reveal something in a picture, you should never think about recording a video afterwards). This means you should *not* record video in places where revealing something illegal through a picture is impossible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Naannoo namni itti baay’atu ta’ee jiraachuun diroonii ikan saan hin dhibne** (Being in a crowded place doesn't hurt the drone) - The passage explicitly warns against this (""Diroonii naannoo buufata xiyyaaraa bira fi bakkee namni itti baay’attu irra balaliisuun yaada badaa dha..."")
* **C: Bakka muddamaa dirooniin badaa itti hin argamne** (Places where bad drone signals aren't found) - This is unrelated to the legal and privacy concerns discussed.
* **D: Iddoo itti kanaan dura eeyyama fudhatte** (Places where permissions have already been granted) - While getting permission is good, the passage focuses on *what you can reveal* in the footage, not whether you have permission to fly.

Here's why:

The passage states that *some* countries require registration with local authorities as part of the visa process. It doesn't say *all* countries do.  The other options are supported by the text:

*   **A:** The text mentions that those staying at tourist accommodations only need to register.
*   **C:** The text directly states you might need to go to the immigration office.
*   **D:** The text says hotels in many areas *do* conduct registration.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa bakka daawwataan galmaa’uuf hin deemne kami?,"Correct answer is **C: Buufata poostaa naannootti**.

Here's why:

The text states that in some countries, you need to register your presence with local authorities, potentially at the police station or immigration office. It also mentions hotels often conduct registration. However, it **doesn't** mention needing to register at a local post office. 

Therefore, a local post office would not be a place to register for a visa process, based on the information provided."
"Yeroo imalaatti, tola ooltummaa irraa eenyutu fayyadamaa hin ta’u?","Correct answer: **B: Nama kaffaltii olaanaa ta’e barbaadu**

Here's why:

The passage states that volunteering typically involves small stipends or covers only expenses like food and lodging. It explicitly mentions it's *not* a way to make a significant income (""waan dhiheessuuf yeroo dheeraaf bakka ta’uuf baajata osoo dheeratee""). 

Therefore, someone looking for a high-paying opportunity would *not* benefit from volunteering.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nama hiriyaa biyya bakkee irraa baafachuu barbaadu** (Someone who wants to escape their home country) - Volunteering *can* be a way to travel and experience new places.
*   **C: Nama ogummaa haaraa barachuu barbaadu** (Someone who wants to learn new skills) - The passage specifically mentions volunteering as a way to gain new knowledge (""oguumma haaraa dabalachuufillee karaa gaarii dha"").
*   **D: Nama dhiyeessii nyaataa fi bakka ciisichaatti gammaduu danda’u** (Someone who is happy with food and accommodation) - The passage states that volunteering provides these things.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that volunteering can be a way to *extend your budget* because it often provides room and board, and sometimes a small stipend. This directly translates to financial savings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Yeroo hedduu gara carraa hojiitti geessa** (Often leads to job opportunities) - While possible, the passage doesn't emphasize this as a direct financial benefit.
*   **C: Nyaataa fi bakki ciisichaa takka takka ni qophaa’a** (Food and lodging are sometimes provided) - This is *part* of the financial benefit, but not the full extent of how it helps the budget.
*   **D: Miira ilaalcha kan biraa argachuu si gargaaruu danda’a** (Can help you gain different perspectives) - This is a personal benefit, but doesn't directly relate to financial savings.

"Akka kutichaatti, Imala giddu-galeessaa gara Woolti Diiznii Woorlidiitti taasifamu baratamaa hin taane kami?","The correct answer is **A: Torban tokko paarkicha habuuruudhaan dabarsuu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...qabeenyaa Disnii utuu gad-hin dhiisin naannoo torban tokkoo achitti dabarsuu, achii manatti deebi’uu of keessatti hammata."" This translates to ""...spending a week near it without letting go of Disney property, returning home feeling satisfied.""  This indicates spending a week *near* the park is part of the common practice.

However, the passage *also* states that Disney **prohibits** reselling tickets: ""tikeeticha nama biraatti dabarsuun hin danda’amu."" (reselling the ticket to another person is not allowed).  Therefore, trying to benefit from a week-long park visit by reselling the ticket is the practice Disney discourages.

Let's look at why the other options are *part* of the common practice described in the text:

*   **B: Hoteela fagoo buufachuu** - The text mentions booking a Disney hotel.
*   **C: Guutummaa turtii imalichaa bakka Diizniitti dabarsuu** - The passage describes spending the entire trip at Disney.
*   **D: Buufata xiyyaaraa gara hoteelichaatti atoobisii qabachuu** - The passage mentions booking airport transportation to the hotel.

Himoota armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee Woolti Diiznii Woorlidii kamtu dhugaa miti?,"The correct answer is **A: Tikeetii park hooppar daawwataa biraaf dabarsuun ni danda’ama** (Park hopper tickets can be transferred to another visitor).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: *""tikeeticha nama biraatti dabarsuun hin danda’amu""* which translates to ""tikeeticha nama biraatti dabarsuun hin danda’amu"" (transferring a ticket to another person is not allowed).

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **B: Bakka sanatti Manni xiqqoon ni argama** (Small houses can be found there) - The text mentions staying ""achii manatti deebi’uu of keessatti hammata"" (returning home with satisfaction) implying the existence of housing nearby.
*   **C: Atoobisoonni imaltoota buufata xiyyaaraa hamma hoteelaatti geessaan ni argamu** (Shuttle buses transport people from the airport to the hotel) - The text mentions ""Do’annaan """"baratamaan,"" Buufata Xiyyaaraa Idil-addunyaa Orlaandoo’tti balali’uu, gara bakka-hojii hoteela Disnii’tti baasii qabachuu"" (Starting from Orlando International Airport, getting picked up to go to the Disney hotel).
*   **D: Tikeetonni guyyaa baay’eef gargaaran caalbaasii toora inarneetaa irratti ni argamu** (Tickets for multiple days are available for purchase online) - The text says ""Tikeetonni baayyeen toora interneetaarraan caalbaasiin karaa marsariitiiwwan akka iiBeey yookaan Kireegliistiin gurguraman"" (Many tickets are purchased online through platforms like iBeey or Craigslist).

Here's why:

The passage states that books and gazetteers focus on ""baraaramuu lafa onaa"" (settlement/development of land) and that there are ""muraasa maxxansaaleen zooniiwwan waraanaa"" (few publications on war zones). This means information about war zones is *scarce* compared to information about land development.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lafa onaa keessatti baraaramuu (Settlement of land):** The passage explicitly states this is a frequent focus of books and gazetteers.
*   **B: Qophii yaala jalqabaa (First aid training):** The passage mentions ""yaalaa jalqaba baay’ee"" (extensive first aid) as a requirement, so it's clearly covered.
*   **D: Ga’ee taphachuu (Navigation/Tracking):** The passage states a desire to ""ga’ee taphachuu barbaada"" (want to be able to track/navigate), indicating it's part of the training.



"
"Akka kutichaatti, mata dureewwan armaan gadii keessaa carraan kutaa leenjii keessatti kaafamuu isaa guddaa ta’e kami?","Correct answer: **A: Yaala jalqabaa**

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""yaalaa jalqaba baay'ee fi yeroo tokkoo yaalii rasaasaas"" (frequent initial attempts and sometimes live fire exercises) as part of the 2-5 day training.  This makes it the most prominent and directly stated component of the training.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: NaZooniiwwan waraanaa (War zones):** While the training is *in* a war zone, the passage only states there are ""muraasa"" (few) publications about war zones, implying it's not a core focus of the training itself.
* **C: Lafa onaa keessatti baraaramuu (Off-road driving):** The passage mentions books and gazettes focusing on this, but notes they are ""beekamoodha"" (known) - suggesting it's not the primary emphasis of *this* specific training.
* **D: Naannoo rakkisaa (Difficult/Risky area):** The course is *located* in a risky area, but the training content isn't described as being *about* the area itself, but about getting authorization to operate within it.

* **The passage states:** ""yoo sodaa qabaattan, bishaan keessan kaampanii beekamaa irraa qaruuraa awwagamaa bitachuu ilaalcha keessa galchuu qabdu"" (If you are worried, you should consider buying filtered/purified water from a reputable company). This directly recommends this option.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Daqiiqota hedduudhaaf bishaan danfisuu** (Letting the water sit for many minutes) - The passage mentions time to filter varies, but doesn't suggest this *is* a good solution.
* **C: Daqiiqaa tokkoof bishaan danfisuu** (Filtering water in one minute) -  The passage points out that some filters are more effective (take longer) than others.
* **D: Rakkoo bishaanichi fiduu danda’au addatti sakatta’uu** (Ignoring the problems the water might cause) - This is the opposite of what the passage advises.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Duuti baayyeen kan uumamu sababa dadhabbii gara dambaliitti deebi’anii daakuuf yaaluu irraa dhufuuni, wanta tarii hin danda’amne."" (Much of the death is caused by attempts to return to the dam, which is impossible.)  This directly explains that trying to return to the dam (dambalii) is what leads to danger and is ultimately unsuccessful.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kattaatti siquudhaan daakuu** (Dying by falling down) - While falling is mentioned as a consequence of going too deep, it's not the primary impossible act.
*   **B: Bishaan gad fagoo keessa daakuu** (Dying in deep water) - Deep water is dangerous, but the passage focuses on the *attempt to return* to the dam as the fatal error.
*   **D: Naannoo dambalii daakuu** (Dying near the dam) - Being near the dam isn't inherently deadly; it's trying to get *back to it* that's the issue.



"
Yoo dambaliin sitti dhufe maal gochuu qabda?,"The correct answer is **A: Dambalii keessaa kallattii biraadhaan ba’uuf yaaluu, sana booda gara qarqaraatti daakuu.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gara dambaliitti deebi’anii daakuu** - The passage specifically says repeatedly trying to return to the dambal is futile and leads to death.
* **C: Kallattii faallaatti daakuu** - The passage doesn't mention this as a strategy.
* **D: Irra-keessa jala daakuu** -  The passage doesn't mention this either.

Here's why:

The text explicitly mentions several waterways as good options for a boating holiday:

*   Loire River
*   Rhine River
*   Danube River
*   Erie Lake

The passage states that boating on these waterways is good for relaxing and exploring. Therefore, *any* inland waterway is a good option, making ""Naannoo karaa bishaanii biyya keessaa kamiyyuu"" (Any inland waterway area) the most encompassing and correct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Magaalaa naannoo Danubeti argamu (Cities near the Danube)** - While the Danube is mentioned, the passage refers to boating *on* the river, not just being near cities along it.
*   **B: Sulula Erietti aansee (Along the Erie Lake)** - Erie Lake is mentioned, but it's just one example.
*   **C: Sulula Rhine (Rhine River)** - Rhine is mentioned, but like Erie, is just one example.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that women who *don't* talk about their private parts correctly (presumably in a respectful and appropriate manner) are not valued.  Therefore, avoiding discussion of ""haala gaa’elaa"" (private parts/genitalia) would make someone undesirable according to the passage's criteria.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Garaagarummaan aadaa amala humnaanii kaasuu akka danda’au hubachuu** - The passage states it's important to *understand* that different cultural norms exist, but it doesn't discourage being selective.
*   **C: Faayawwan calaqqisan uffachuu hambisuu** - The text does not mention this at all.
*   **D: Yeroo barbaachisutti cimina fayyadamuu** - The text focuses on resisting men who are ""unworthy"" and not relying on ""ejjenoo"" (presumably physical appearance or charm), which is related to using discernment and not weakness.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""irree qabamuunii fi kan kana fakkaatan wanta hin baramne miti"" which translates to ""being harassed and similar things are not acceptable."" This directly relates to avoiding being followed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Haala gaa’elaa ibsuuf qubeelaa guddaa keewwachuu** (Wearing large glasses to hide your features) - The passage mentions glasses, but only as a potentially expensive and not necessarily effective method. It doesn't advocate for it as *good* advice.
* **C: Garaagarummaan aadaa ejjennoo kee hambisuu akka ibsu hubachuu** (Understanding that cultural differences limit your preferences) - The passage says *not* to base preferences on cultural differences.
* **D: Haala keessa ba’aa hin barbaadamnetti, dhiira ofirraa deebisuutti jabaachuu** (Being strong at rejecting unwanted male attention) - While rejecting unwanted attention is important, the passage focuses more on *avoiding* situations where that becomes necessary by recognizing unacceptable behavior like harassment and being followed.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, nama bineensota bosonaa suuraa kaasuuf leensii addaa fayyadamuun yoom isa barbaachisa?","The correct answer is **A: Uumamoota xixiqqoo yeroo waraaban** (When small creatures are being photographed).

Here's why:

The passage states: *""Suura bineensota daggalaa kaasun kaameeraa leensii dheeraa qabu gaafata, wantootni akka gurmuu simbiraa ykn uumama xixxiqqaa ta’an leensi adda biraa barbaadu.""* This directly translates to ""Photographing lowland animals requires a camera with a long lens, while things like bird nests or small creatures require a different lens.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Yeroo suuraan sun dhimma daldalaaf fayyadamaman** (When the photo is used for commercial purposes) - The passage mentions rules about commercial photography in parks, but doesn't say a different lens is *needed* in these cases.
*   **C: Bineensonni suuraa kaafaman yoo qaana’an** (When the animals being photographed are skinny/thin) - The passage mentions animals being thin as a characteristic but not a reason for a different lens.
*   **D: Yoo paarkonni bineensota suuraa kaasuu irratti seera addaa qabaatan** (When parks have specific rules about taking animal pictures) -  The passage states parks *have* rules, but doesn't link that to needing a different lens.

kanneen armaan gadii keessaa namoota suuraa bineensota bosonaa kaasaniif akka rakkinaatti kan hin eeramne kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Bineensota fagoorraa dhufan muraasa** (A few distant animals).

Here's why:

The passage states the difficulties of photographing wildlife include:

*   **Different lenses for different subjects:** (e.g., long lenses for distant animals, different lenses for small creatures).
*   **Difficulty identifying different species.**
*   **Park regulations regarding photography for commercial purposes.**
*   **Animals being shy or in difficult conditions (cold, hot, struggling to survive).**

The passage *doesn't* mention difficulty with animals coming from far away as a problem. In fact, it explicitly states a need for long lenses *specifically* to photograph distant animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bineensota hamoo wajjin walitti ba’uu** (Being with shy animals) - The passage specifically states animals can be shy and therefore difficult to photograph.
*   **C: Gosa leensii barbaadamu argachuu** (Finding the needed lens type) - The passage explains the need for different lenses and implicitly suggests finding the right one can be a challenge.
*   **D: Naannoo hin mijanne keessatti hojjechuu** (Working in inaccessible areas) - The passage implies difficult conditions (hot, cold, struggling to survive) which can relate to inaccessible areas.

Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa konkolaachisaa karaa garaa irra imalaniif carraa rakkina ta’uu dhiphaa kan qabu?,"The correct answer is **B: Rigata xiqqoo** (Small ridges).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""rigatni isaa xinnaa kan ta’ee fi akka waan asfaaltii qullaarra jirtuutti oofuu hin dandeessu"" which translates to ""its ridges are small and cannot grip like asphalt."" This directly indicates that small ridges on the road increase the chance of a vehicle sliding/losing control.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sosochii tiraafikaa cimaa ta’e** (Heavy traffic flow) - While heavy traffic can *cause* accidents, the text doesn’t say it makes sliding more likely.
*   **C: Garmalee walitti tuuta’uu** (Heat building up) - The text doesn't mention heat as a factor.
*   **D: Argama gadi bu’aa** (Decreased visibility) - Reduced visibility is a hazard, but the text focuses on the *surface* of the road, not seeing the road.



"
Waa’ee gibira galii biyyoota garaagaraa keessatti dhaabbataadhaan walfakkaachuu kan danda’u maali?,"Correct answer is **B: Caasaa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Qaraxni galii biyyoota garaa garaatti **caasaa** garaa garaa qaba..."" (Income tax rates vary in different countries). This directly answers the question about what can differ across countries regarding income tax.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hamma kaffaltii (Amount paid):** The amount someone *pays* in tax depends on their income and deductions, not a standard feature of the tax system itself.
*   **C: Iddoo itti galmooftu (Where it's paid):** While the method of payment might vary, this isn't a fundamental difference in tax *structure*.
*   **D: sadaala (Deductions):** The passage mentions deductions vary, but the core difference *between* countries is the *rate* of the tax.

"Akka kutichaatti, iddoo ati jiraattu kan biraa ta’ee iddoon hojii kee biyyaa ala yoo ta’e, kaffaltii gibira galii eessatti kaffaluu malta?","Correct answer: **A: Iddoo ati bu’uureffatte**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yoo dippiloomaati taate malee, biiyya alaa keessaa dalaguu jechuun akka waliigalaatti biyya bu’ureeffatte keessatti gibira galii kee galchuu qabda."" (Unless you are a diplomat, meaning you are working abroad, you generally need to pay income tax in the country where you are *resident*.)

Therefore, the place where you are resident is where you pay income tax, even if your work is in another country. The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Yuunaayitid Isteeti keessatti:** This is too specific. The passage talks about general principles, not just the US.
*   **C: Biyya ati yeroo ammaa keessatti hojjechaa jirtu:** While work location is relevant, residency is the primary factor.
*   **D: Iddoo itti kaffaltiin kee xiqqoo ta’e:** This is not mentioned in the passage and is a misleading criterion."
Himoota armaan gadii keessaa agarsiisa addunyaa kan sirriitti hin ibsine kami?,"Correct answer is **D: Biyyootni hirmaachuun irraa hin eegamu**.

Here's why:

The text states that countries *participate* to showcase their culture and history. However, it doesn't say participation is *mandatory* or that all countries are automatically included. It implies participation is voluntary. 

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: Wanti agarsiifamu seenaa yookiin aadaa biyyichaa mul’isuu mala** - The text directly states countries showcase their culture and history (""dhimmoota addunyaa yookiin aadaa fi seenaa biyya isaanii"").
*   **B: Agarsiisni abaaboo, agarsiisa aartii fi barnootaa wajjin dhiyaata** - The text mentions ""oomisha Abaaboo Idila-addunyaa taateewwan addaa kan agariisa biqilootaa biyyaa"" (global Expo products) and ""agarsiisawwan aartummaa qabanii fi barsiisoo ta’an"" (artistic and educational displays).
*   **C: Agarsiisni ji’oota ja’aaf turuu danda’a** - The text says the exhibitions can last ""ji’a sadiif jaha gidduu kan turuu"" (between three and six months).



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu seera agrsiisa addunyaati?,"Correct answer: **A: Wanti agarsiifamu seenaa biyyaa fi dhimmota addunyaa agarsiisuu qaba**

(Participating countries present artistic and educational displays to showcase global issues or their country's culture and history.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage says countries *can* hold the event yearly, but it's not mandatory. (""Sadarkaa yaadaatti waggaa waggaadhaan raawwachuu haa danda’an iyyuu malee..."")
*   **C:** The passage states the events last for 3 months (ji’a sadiif), not just during the rainy season (ji’a ja’a).
*   **D:** The passage doesn't require all countries to participate. It only mentions participating countries."

"Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa, akka bineensa miidhuu danda’uutti kuticha keessatti kan hin eeramne kami?","Correct answer is **D: Bineensota namootni hin beekne**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the dangers posed by *known* large animals like bison, elk, moose, and bears. It explicitly warns about keeping distance from these creatures. It also mentions that animals are instinctively wary of things that smell like food (like beer), and therefore avoid them. 

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned as dangers:

*   **A: Foolii cimaa (Strong smells):** The passage warns against leaving food or anything that smells like food, as animals will be attracted to it.
*   **B: Fageenya eeggachuu dhiisuu (Not keeping a safe distance):** The passage repeatedly emphasizes the importance of maintaining a safe distance from large animals.  Many accidents happen because people don't respect this distance.
*   **C: Bineensota nyaachisuu (Feeding animals):** The passage states animals will avoid food smells and warns about leaving food out.

However, the passage does *not* mention the danger of unfamiliar animals as a specific concern. It’s about the known dangers of the large animals present in the park."
Akkaataa kutichaatti akkordiyoonicha sirriitti tapahachuudhaf odeeffannoo sirrii ta’ee kan hin fudhatamne maalidha?,"The correct answer is **A: Sagalee dabalataaf, humna ittiin batanii (key) rukuttu dabali**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Yaadadhu, akka piyaanoorrattii sagalee dabalataatiif furtuuwwan humna guddaadhaan rukutuun hinbarbaachisu."" (Remember, like a piano, pressing keys with great force isn't necessary for a louder sound.)

This directly contradicts option A, which suggests *increasing* the force with which you press the keys to get a louder sound.  The passage explains that, like a piano, you achieve loudness through other mechanisms (the bellows).

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

* **B: Humna kee tursiisuf sochii hin barbaachifne xiqqeessi** - This aligns with the passage's advice to relax and avoid unnecessary movement (""hanga danda’ametti suuta suuta of dadhabsiista"").
* **C: Harkee osuma laaffistuu nootawwan rukutuu qalbeeffadhu** - This is a key instruction from the passage (""P: Furtuuwwan hunda sirriitti yeroo rukuttu hanga danda’ametti harka kee laaffisuu kee mirkaneeffadhu"")
* **D: Sagalee dabalataa argachuuf saffisa ittiin meeshaa isa jalaa (bellows) rukuttu dabali** - The passage compares the instrument to a piano and mentions using bellows to control volume.

"Akkoordiyoonii yeroo taphatan, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa sagalee (volume) dabaluuf gargaaran kami?","The correct answer is **C: Dhiibbaa ykn gadi qabuu xiqqaa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Akoordiyoonicha irratti, sagalee dabalataa argachuuf, **dhibbaa ykn saffisa dabalataatiin buufaawwan fayyadamtu.**"" This directly translates to ""On the accordion, to get a louder sound, use bellows with more pressure or **less resistance**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Saffisa heddu (Much speed):** While speed is involved, the passage focuses on *how* the air is moved, not just how fast.
*   **B: Humna heddu (Much strength):** The passage specifically states that using great strength like a piano isn't necessary.
*   **D: sochii qubaa xiqqaa (Small bellows movement):** Small movement wouldn't increase volume.



"
Televizhiinii irratti suurawwan fiixensaanii maalif cita?,"The correct answer is **B: Suurri iskiriinii guutee akka mul’atuuf** (To make sure the image fills the screen).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the cropping (daangaa kutu, gubbaa, jalaa fi bukke qaban) is done ""to make sure the entire screen is covered"" (suurichi guutuu iskiriinii akka haguuge mirkaneessuuf). This is a direct consequence of the film being originally formatted for a different aspect ratio than the TV.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Barreeffama gajjalaa deemu (subtitles) galchuuf** (To add subtitles) - The passage doesn't mention subtitles at all.
*   **C: Foormatiwwan birootiwwan birootti qunnamtii salphaa hayyamuuf** (To make compatibility with different formats easier) -  While aspect ratio *can* affect compatibility, the passage focuses on filling the screen.
*   **D: Barreeffama gajjallaa deemu kan gara gadiitti baay’ee dhiyaate kutuuf** (To cut off excessive text from the bottom) - This is not mentioned in the passage.

"Akkataa kutichaatti, fiilmii tokko gara foormaatii DVDtti gaafa jijjiiramu rakkoowwan armaan gadii keessaa kamtu nama mudata?","The correct answer is **A: Suura iskiriinii hin guunne** (Incomplete screen image).

Here's why:

The passage directly states the problem is that the film, when converted to DVD, ""humnaa ol iskaanii gochuudha"" (scans too high) causing the image to be cut off at the edges, top, and bottom. This results in the picture not filling the entire screen. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Barreeffama gajjalaa dee mu kan walakkaan cite** (Subtitles are blurry and fragmented) - The passage doesn't mention subtitle issues.
* **C: Suura guutummaa iskiriinii guutu** (Complete full-screen image) - This is the *opposite* of the problem described.
* **D: Fiixeewwan cite** (Faded colors) - The passage doesn't discuss color problems.



"
Loltoonni Biriteen eessa qubatan?,"The correct answer is **B: Tireentan**. 

Here's why:

The text states, ""Jeeneraal Jeemsi Eewiingi miliishoota 700 Tireentan Feeriitti lagicha ceesisee, riqicha Assunpink Creek irraa jiru qabatee akka loltootni diinaa hin miliqnee dhorka."" This means General Ewing positioned militia at **Tireentan** to prevent the enemy from fording the creek. While Assunpink Creek is mentioned, it's the location *near* Tireentan, not where the British camped."
Barreeffama harkaan barreeffamerratti mallattoo eenyutu mul’ata?,"The correct answer is **D: Chaalas Toomsan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...barreeffami duraa harkaan qopheeffamee Pirezidaantii Koongireesii Joon Hankuukii **fi Barreessaa Chaarlis Toomsaniin** mallatteeffame..."" 

This directly says that Charles Toomsan signed the handwritten document along with President John Hancock.
"
"Bakkeewwan armaan gadii keessaa, Daanlap yeroo dhumaa kan dhufe eessa ture?","The correct answer is **C: Landan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Garagalchaan isaas Hagayya 10 Landaniin ga’e."" This translates to ""Its last arrival was on August 10th in London."" 

Therefore, Daanlap (or the document) last arrived in London.



"
Loltoonni Koloneel Istaark eessa buufatanii turan?,"The correct answer is **D: Dallaa fuuldura**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Namoonni Istaarki dhuma kaaba bakkeewwan Qubattoota kolonichaarra dallicharra dalga galanii iddoo qabatan."" which translates to ""Istaarki's men at the end of the cliff, on the front line, deployed and occupied a position.""

Therefore, the loltoonni (troops) were positioned on the **front line (dallaa fuuldura)**.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti (the passage), namoonni Istaarkis dallaasaanii kan bal’isan yoom ture?","Correct Answer: **A: Humni dabalataa akka gargaaraniif yeroo waamaman**

**Explanation:**

The passage states: ""Koloneeffattoonni, gochaawwan kana arganii, humna dabalataa waammatan. Namoonni Istaarki dhuma kaaba bakkeewwan Qubattoota kolonichaarra dallicharra dalga galanii iddoo qabatan."" 

This directly translates to: ""Upon seeing these actions, the colonels summoned reinforcements. Istark's men then spread out and occupied positions on the colonial outposts.""

This means the spreading out (dallaasaa) happened *after* the reinforcements were summoned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Warri idileen erga daangaa (stake) erga darbanii booda:** The passage doesn't mention any stakes or a race.
* **C: Yeroo galaanni gadi galu:** The passage mentions a retreat (""yeroo dhahaa gad-aanaan""), but this is *after* they have already spread out.
* **D: Yeroo loltoonni bakkeewwan fuulduraa qabatan:** The passage says Istark’s men took positions *after* reinforcements were summoned, not simultaneously with the initial occupation of forward positions by the troops.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tokkoon tokkoon fiigicha olii gadii ykn hiriira tikfatteewwanii kun naannoo guyyoota 17 tiif tura."" (Each upward and downward move or clustered building lasts about 17 days). This directly supports the idea that the colony stops changing locations after around 17 days, at least for that particular phase.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yeroo halkanii dunkaana buufatu** (When they fill the dwelling with their bodies) - While the passage mentions the ants filling the dwelling, it doesn’t relate to the nomadic phase itself.
* **B: Dhiyeessii nyaataa xiqqaa qabu** (Having a small food supply) - The passage mentions scavenging for food, but doesn't directly link it to the nomadic phase ending.
* **D: Yeroo guyyaa bobba’u** (When the day is cloudy) -  The weather isn't mentioned as a factor in the passage.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, yeroo gulantaa nomaadikiitti akkaataa dunkaana dhaabbachuu waraana mixii himni sirriitti ibsu kamiidha?","The correct answer is **C: Guyyaadhan dunkaana jijjiiru**.

* **The passage states:** ""hommaan kun asiif achi deemu jalqaba yeroo nyaanni jalaa hir’achaa adeemu. yeroo kanattii homaan kun mana xiqqoo guyyaa guyyaatti jijjiiramu ijaarrachuu jalqabu."" This directly translates to ""This creature initially appears when escaping from food. Later, this creature begins to be realized by changing a small house daily.""

This means the creature changes its dwelling (its ""dunkaana"" or base) *daily*.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yeroo halkanii dunkaana ijaaru:** The passage doesn't mention creating a base during their halting/resting periods.
* **B: Osoo dunkaana hin dhaabbatin guyyaa 17’f bobba’u:**  The passage states the changes last for around 17 days, but doesn't say they wander without establishing a base.
* **D: Yeroo turtii sanatti dunkaanuma tokko fayyadamu:** The passage explicitly states the base changes daily, ruling this out.

This translates to: ""Rukuttaan strongly recognizes and utilizes the inherent physiological and behavioral systems, particularly the ecological and productive outputs based on biological cues of indigenous marsaawwan (marshes/wetlands).""

The passage directly links Rukuttaan's behavior to cues from ""indigenous marsaawwan"" (marshes/wetlands).  The other options are not mentioned in the passage.

* **The passage states:** ""Yeroo namootni dhuunfaa waan amala tokkoof garaagarummaa agarsiisan isaan poolimorfikii jedhamu."" (When individuals show variation for a specific trait, they are called polymorphic.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Monoforbikii:**  The passage defines *monomorphic* as being when individuals have the *same* trait.
* **B: Orgaanizimiiwwan:** This simply means ""organisms"" and doesn't relate to trait variation.
* **C: Sanyiiwwan:** This means ""species"" and doesn't specifically describe trait variation within a species.



"
Orgaanizimoota bakka murtaa’aa qabataniif kanneen armaan gadii keessaa jechi sirriin kamiidha?,"The correct answer is **A: Monoforbikii**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yeroo namoonni dhuunfaan uumata kessaa hunduu amala ta’e tokkoon walfakkaatan moonoomoorfiikii jedhamuun beekamu.""  This directly translates to: ""When individuals within a population all share a single characteristic, they are known as monomorphic.""
* **The question asks about** organisms with a defined characteristic. Monomorphic organisms *by definition* have that defined, single characteristic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Uummata** -  ""Uummata"" simply means population, which is a broader term than the specific characteristic being described.
* **C: Sanyiiwwan** - ""Sanyiiwwan"" means species, also a broader term.
* **D: Poolimorphobikii** - The passage defines polymorphism as *variation* in characteristics, the *opposite* of having a defined characteristic.

Here's why:

* **The passage defines ecotourism as focusing on wildlife and natural environments.** It lists activities like birdwatching, seeing animals, and learning about ecosystems.
* **Option A (Bishaan tabbarraa bu’u koruu - Going white-water rafting)** is an adventure tourism activity, not specifically focused on wildlife.
* **Option B (Abaabowwan bakkee suura kaasuu - Taking pictures of flowers)** *is* an activity that fits ecotourism, as it's observing nature.
* **Option D (Waan balali’u nam-tolchee fayyadamuun qurxummii qabuu - Taking photos while hot air ballooning)** is an adventure tourism activity, it's not about the wildlife or natural environment itself.
* **Option C (Godambaa saayinsii daawwachuu - Visiting a science museum)** focuses on scientific learning, not on the natural world and its creatures, therefore it doesn’t fall under the definition of ecotourism provided in the text.

This clearly identifies private vehicles as the foundation of the commuting system described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bakkeewwan hojii (Workplaces):** While workplaces are the destination, they aren't the *basis* of the commuting method.
*   **C: Baayosferii tasgabbaa’aa (Stable biosphere):** This refers to the Earth's environment and is related to the wider context of carbon emissions, but not the commuting system itself.
*   **D: Jijjiirama dhala namaa (Human evolution):** This is a long-term consequence mentioned in the passage, but not the foundation of the current commuting method.

The text specifically states: ""Pirootoononni chaarjii elektrikaa pozetiivii yemmuu qabaatan niituroononni chaarjii hin qabani."" which translates to ""Protons have a positive electric charge while neutrons have no charge.""

Therefore, the particles within the nucleus that have a charge are protons, and that charge is positive."

The text explicitly states: ""Niwukilasiin paartikiloota lama qabateera - niwutiroonotaa fi pirootoonota."" (The nucleus has two particles - neutrons and protons.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Niwutiroonotaafi elektirioonota** (Neutrons and electrons) - Electrons are *not* found in the nucleus.
* **C: Elektitoonotaafi pirotoonota** (Electrons and protons) - Electrons are not in the nucleus.

*   **C: Waa’ee naannoo hubannaa bal’aa qabaachuu** - The text mentions blogging helps students learn about their surroundings (""akka barattootni baayee hubataniif addunyaa naannoo isaanii beekaniif gargaara"").
*   **D: Itti fufiinsan barachuuf fedhiin dabaluu** - The text suggests blogging increases student engagement and motivation (""akka baratootni baayee cimoo fi hawaato ta’aaniif gargaraa"").

However, the passage **does not mention** anything about students seeking or receiving feedback from peers. Therefore, **B** is the option that isn’t discussed in the provided text.



"
Barattoonni dandeettii bareessuu isaanii akka cimsataniif barreessuu bifa kamtu eerame?,"Correct answer: **C: Fedhii hordoftootasaanii eeguu**

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Barreessaan biloogichaa barreeffama fooyyeffatee komii hambisuuf carraaquu eegala. Akkasuma biloogii gochuun “akka barattootni baayee hubataniif addunyaa naannoo isaanii beekaniif gargaara.” Fedha namoota dawwatanii beekun akka baratootni baayee cimoo fi hawaato ta’aaniif gargaraa.""  This directly implies that paying attention to the desires/feedback (fedhii) of their audience (hordoftootasaanii) helps students become stronger and more motivated writers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Intarneetirratti yeroo heddu barreeffamootaf deebii kennuu** - While getting feedback is helpful, the passage doesn't emphasize *repeatedly* responding to comments as the core writing improvement technique.
*   **B: Qeeqa jalaa miliquuf hariifachuu** - The passage mentions avoiding embarrassment, but doesn't suggest actively striving to be provocative.
*   **D: Tumsaaf fedhii qabaachuu** - The passage doesn't mention anything about a desire for conflict or rebellion.

Kanneen armaan gadii keessaaa barattootaf fayidaa komunikeeshinii al-kallattii (asynchronous communication) kan hin taane kami? ,"The correct answer is **B: Guyyaatti yeroo kamittuu barsiisota qaaman argachuu**.

Here's why:

* **Asynchronous communication** means communication that doesn't happen in real-time.  It's *not* about immediate responses.  You send a message and the recipient answers when *they* have time.

Let's look at why the other options *are* examples of asynchronous communication:

* **A: Intarneetii akka maddaatti fayyadamuu:** The internet allows for sending messages (like emails or forum posts) that are read and responded to later.
* **C: Sa’aatii hojii dhaabbataa hin taane:** This refers to the flexibility of not being tied to a fixed work schedule, which is characteristic of asynchronous work and learning.
* **D: Saffisa to’achuu:**  The text explains asynchronous communication allows students to work at their own pace and submit work according to their schedule.

However, **""Guyyaatti yeroo kamittuu barsiisota qaaman argachuu""** describes *synchronous* communication - direct, real-time interaction.  If you can always reach a teacher immediately, that's not asynchronous.  

The passage states that students can ask questions *and expect a response eventually*, not instantly.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, barattootaf fayidaa komunikeeshinii al-kallattii kamtu dhaabbataa kan hin taane miti?","The correct answer is **B: Sa’aatii hojii** (Working hours).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...Yeroo daangeffamaa xiqqootu jira sa’aa hojii mijata mijeessuu keessatti."" This translates to ""...There is a short time frame for making work hours conducive.""  This means the passage *identifies* working hours as a potential limitation, not a benefit of asynchronous communication. It suggests they are something to be *adjusted* to make communication work, not a positive outcome of it.

Let's look at why the other options are benefits mentioned in the text:

* **A: Saffisa ittiin baratan** (Learning pace) - The passage directly states it helps students work at their own pace.
* **C: Meeshaa barnootaa** (Learning tools) -  While not explicitly called ""tools,"" the passage implies resources are available to aid learning.
* **D: Itti fayyadama intarneetii** (Internet usage) - The passage explicitly mentions the benefit of constant access to information through the internet and World Wide Web.



Therefore, **sa’aatii hojii** is the only option that doesn't represent a benefit of asynchronous communication as described in the provided text."
Waanta namni tokko masaraa bara meedicaalii (medieval castles) wajjin wal qabsiisu kan kuticha keessatti hin eeramne maalidha?,"The correct answer is **A: Boolla dukkanaa (Dark dungeons)**.

Here's why:

The passage heavily emphasizes the *sensory experience* of being in a medieval castle – the sounds of hooves, the smell of a well, the echoes of ancient battles.  It's a description designed to evoke a feeling of being immersed in that time.  

However, the passage *doesn't* mention dungeons. While castles often *had* dungeons, the passage focuses on grander, more public aspects. The other options are all directly referenced within the text:

* **B: Dorgommii fardaa (Sound of hooves)** - ""kottee fardeenii dhagaa afamaarraa dhaga’uun"" (hearing the clatter of hooves on stone).
* **C: Amala gaarii loltuu (The bravery of warriors)** - The whole passage discusses war and fighting.
* **D: Loltoota (Warriors)** - Implied throughout as the source of the war sounds.

Therefore, the element *not* included in the passage's description of a medieval castle is dark dungeons.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessa akka foolii ykn sagalee masaraa onaa keessaa dhagahamuu kan kuticha keessatti hin eeramin kamiidha?,"The correct answer is **A: Lolawwan**.

Here's why:

The passage describes sounds like ""kottee fardeenii dhagaa afamaarraa dhaga’uun"" (the clatter of horse hooves on stone) and ""sagalee fi foolii waraana dur durii"" (the voices and sounds of ancient battles).  It specifically mentions these sounds are easily brought to mind. 

* **Lolawwan (songs)** are *not* mentioned as being heard within the described mental imagery.
* **Sodaa (steam)** is mentioned (""sodaa boolla dahannoo keessaa ol aaru suufuun"" - steam rising from a pot of simmering)
* **Sagantaa nyaataa miidhagaa (a feast/dining ceremony)** is implied through the mention of ""nyaachisa guddaa"" (a great feast)
* **Kottee (clatter)** *is* explicitly mentioned.

Therefore, **lolawwan** is the only option that doesn't fit the sounds described as being evoked in the passage's imagery."
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa masaraa Kirby Muxloe kan sirriitti ibsu kami?,"The correct answer is **B: Sababa biyyattiin nagaa taatef yeroo ijaarsatti dahoo xiqqaa barbaachisa ture**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""... biyyattiin giddu naga-qabeettii turte, akkasumas ittisni kan barbaachisu gaafa balaa geessistoonni garee xiqqoo dhufan qofa ture."" This directly translates to ""the country was relatively peaceful, and the defense needed was only against small groups of raiders.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While Lord Hasting initiated the construction, the passage doesn't say he *funded* it.
* **C:** The passage implies the construction *was* significant due to its defensive capabilities.
* **D:** While it was designed for defense, the passage highlights the *lack* of a large threat, making extensive, long-term defense less critical.



"
Akkaataa ijaarsawwan armaan gadii keessaa waktii kuticha keessatti ibsame sanatti Masaraa Kirby Muxloe kan fakkaatu kamiidha?,"The correct answer is **B: Bu’uura haleellaa dhufu dandamachuuf ijaarame** (A fortress built to withstand attack).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Foddaan isaa babal’aanii fi keenyan isaa haphiin yeroo dheeraadhaaf haleellaa cimaa ofirraa ittisuu hindanda’an turan."" (Its walls were thick and its stone strong, unable to withstand a long and serious attack.) This directly implies it was built for defense, to withstand attacks.
* **The passage also mentions:** ""...gaafa balaa geessistoonni garee xiqqoo dhufan qofa ture."" (...only when small bands of attackers came.) This suggests it wasn't a major, imposing fortress, but sufficient for the threats it faced.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Foddaawwan gurguddaa (Thick walls)** - While the passage *mentions* thick walls, it doesn’t define the entire castle as just that. It describes its function.
* **C: Masaraawwan tokko tokko caala dahannoo muraasa kan qabu (Castles with less grandeur than some)** - The passage doesn't focus on the castle's opulence or lack thereof, but on its defensive capabilities.
* **D: Keenyaa furdaa (A free keep)** - This doesn't align with the defensive context provided in the passage.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa atileetii waktii dhufuuf qophaa’uf baay’ee bu’a qabeessa kan ta’e kamiidha?","Correct answer: **A: Yeroo waktii gannaa fiigicha qaxxaamuraa shaakaluu**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes needing to improve speed ""very slightly"" but with ""complete certainty"" to shave off miles. It also highlights the athlete needing to be prepared for a very specific, challenging course (the winding, uphill trail).  This strongly suggests the most beneficial preparation is *specifically* practicing and understanding the demands of that course – focusing on pacing and strategy within the time constraints of the race.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Yeroo leenjii saffisa dabaluu irratti xiyyeeffachuu (Focusing on increasing speed training):** The passage states the speed improvement needed is *very small*.  Massive speed work isn't the primary goal.
* **C: Yeroo daqiiqaa sadiin mo’achuu (Practicing to finish in three minutes):** The runner already finishes in two minutes, so aiming for three is irrelevant.
* **D: Qaama gara olii jabeessuf jiimii fayyadamuu (Using the gym to strengthen the upper body):** While upper body strength is good, the passage specifically connects preparation to the *course* itself, not general fitness.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa nama cimaa walakkaa maayilii fiiguf kamtu baay’ee barbaachisaadha?","Correct answer: **B: Saffisa caalaa cimina jabeessuu**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that while speed is important (""saffisaa baay’ee xiqqaataa dhufa""), **complete endurance/strength (""jabeenyi guutumatti murteessaa ta’aa dhufa"") is *essential***.  The scenario describes a long-distance run (a mile) that also requires overcoming obstacles.  Therefore, being able to *sustain* that effort (endurance) is more crucial than just being fast. 

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Ji’oota gannaatti fiigicha qaxxaamuraa shaakaluu** (Practicing long-distance running in the winter) - While practice is good, the passage focuses on the *qualities* needed, not just preparation.
*   **C: Daqiiqaa lamaa gaditti mo’achuu ykn galuu** (Finishing in under two minutes) - The passage states someone *can* finish in two minutes, but this isn't the main factor for success.  It's about completing the course *with* obstacles.
*   **D: Cimina caalaa saffisa dabaluu** (Increasing speed over strength) - This is the *opposite* of what the passage suggests.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessa shaakala nyaataa qofaan atileetin tokko kan hin milkeessine kamiidha?,"The correct answer is **C: Dandeettii addaa (Extra ability)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that nutrition *alone* (Amalli nyaataa seer-qabeessi qofti) doesn't create exceptional ability (dandeettii bayeessa). It *does* contribute to complete well-being and improved performance in endurance athletes.  The passage emphasizes understanding hydration habits and various types of fatigue to *optimize* an athlete's existing ability and enjoyment. It doesn't suggest nutrition grants *new* or *extra* abilities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dandeettii fooyya’e (Improved ability):** The passage says nutrition helps optimize ability.
*   **B: Gammachuu dabale (Increased enjoyment):** The passage specifically mentions nutrition helping with enjoyment.
*   **D: Fayyummaa walii galaa (Complete well-being):**  The passage directly links nutrition to complete well-being.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’un, karaa ittiin atileetonni dargaggeeyyin karaa isaan caalmatti ittiin ispoortitti gammadan kan hin gorfamne kamiidha?","The correct answer is **B: Dhaabbataadhan sadarkaa olaanan gahuumha agarsiisuu (Achieving high levels of performance through training)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on how *nutrition* (specifically, proper hydration and understanding individual nutritional needs) enhances athletic enjoyment and performance. It states a good diet *alone* isn't enough, but it significantly impacts athletes.

Let's look at why the other options are less relevant to the *unmentioned* way athletes might enjoy sports:

*   **A: Nyaata sirrii nyaachuu (Eating the right food):** The passage *directly* discusses the importance of nutrition. It's a core focus, not something unmentioned.
*   **C: sirriitti dhangala’aa fudhachuu (Properly accepting challenges):** While mental fortitude is important, the passage doesn't address this aspect of enjoyment.
*   **D: Madaala anniisaa fayyaa eeguu (Maintaining physical health through rest):**  Rest and recovery are implied within the idea of respecting the body's needs (hydration, nutrition), but are not highlighted as the key, *unmentioned* factor.

The passage suggests that maximizing performance through personalized nutrition allows athletes to enjoy their sport more. Therefore, pushing for extremely high performance through rigorous training, which might neglect individual needs or enjoyment, would be the way athletes might engage in sports without fully enjoying it.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, namni fageenya giddu galeessa fiigu tokko maalif meeshaalee qaalii bituu mala?","Correct answer: **A: Filannoo dhuunfaa isaaniti**

Here's why:

The passage states that athletes are often heard choosing expensive gear ""even when it doesn't offer any real benefit."" This directly implies the decision is based on personal preference (Filannoo dhuunfaa) rather than a tangible advantage (Fayidaa waan qabuufi) or actual performance improvement (Gahuumsa isaanii irratti jijjiirama cimaa fideera). The passage also suggests a misunderstanding about expensive equipment (Waa’ee meeshaalee qaalii hin taanee ilaalcha sirrii hin taanetu jira) is a reason *why* they might choose expensive gear, but the direct reason given is the athletes' choices themselves."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, fiigichi fageenya giddu galeessaa maal barbaada?","Correct answer is **C: Meeshaa baay’ee xiqqaa**

Here's why:

The passage states that while long-distance running isn't *physically* demanding compared to other sports, there's a lot of misinformation about the *small equipment* needed to participate. It goes on to say that much of the equipment sold doesn’t actually improve performance. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Meeshaalee heddu (A lot of equipment)** - The passage implies the *belief* that a lot of equipment is needed, but says most of it is useless.
* **B: Dandeettii atileetiksii qabaachuu (Having athletic ability)** - The passage doesn't focus on the athlete's ability, but the equipment.
* **D: Qarshii heddu (A lot of money)** - The passage talks about people *buying* equipment, implying cost, but doesn't say a lot of money is required.

Resonansii maagneetii nikularaa eenyutu argate? ,"The correct answer is **C: Biloonch fi Parseel**.

Waraqaan abbummaa argannoo resonansii eksiree meedikaalaa jalqabaa bara kam kenname? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Waggaa afur booda mirgi abbummaa kalaqaa kennameef, kunis Damee MRI Keessatti dhimma mirga abbummaa kalaqaaa Addunyaa isa jalqabaa ture."" This means the patent was granted four years after Raymond Damadian's discovery in 1970. 1970 + 4 = 1974. 

While Dr. Damadian completed the first whole-body MRI scanner in 1977, the *patent* was awarded in 1974."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, sochii ykn gochaa qaamaa nama biraa hubachuuf waanti namoonni hubannoo cimaa qabaachuu qaban maalidha?","The correct answer is **D: Hubannoo (Understanding)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that understanding the thoughts of others is *the most important* of the abilities mentioned (wanting, believing, knowing, desiring). It goes on to illustrate this with an example of understanding *why* someone is trying to get into a car – are they trying to get into their own car, or someone else’s? This requires understanding their intention, which is a form of *hubannoo*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hawwii (Desire):** While desire plays a role in motivation, the passage focuses on *interpreting* action, not just knowing someone *wants* something.
* **B: Niyyaa (Intention):** While understanding intention is part of it, *hubannoo* is the broader ability to grasp the underlying thought process.  The passage is about the ability to *figure out* the intention.
* **C: Amantaa (Belief):** Belief is what *you* hold to be true, not necessarily understanding what *someone else* is thinking.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, niyaa hubachuun namni maal akka godhuuf gargaara?","The correct answer is **D: Waan sammuu namoota biroo keessa jiru dubbisuu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Dhalli has a strong ability to read the minds (sammuu) of others – to understand what they think, believe, know, or desire. It even provides an example of deducing someone's intentions with a car.  This directly aligns with ""reading what is in the minds of others.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shakkii gochaa qaamaa duuba jiru hambisa (Suppresses doubt about physical actions):** While understanding intentions *can* reduce doubt, the primary ability described isn't about suppressing doubt.
*   **B: Fedhii raaguf (To fulfill desires):** Understanding others doesn't automatically fulfill desires.
*   **C: Osoo itti hin murteessin namoota biroo ilaaluu (Looking at others without judging them):** This is a valuable trait, but not the specific power Dhalli possesses.

* **Other options:**
    * **A: Tajaajila maamilaa** (Customer service) - While AI is *used* in customer service, the passage doesn't highlight it as a core area of overlap.
    * **C: Asoosama saayinsii** (Scientific research) - The passage states AI is a tool *for* science, but isn't fundamentally tied *to* it in the same way as planning.
    * **D: Barreeffama harkaa hubachuu** (Understanding written text) - The passage mentions understanding text as an *example* of what AI can do, but doesn't position it as a primary, consistently linked field.

Here's why:

The passage describes convergent thinking as focusing on logic, accuracy, identifying truths, and utilizing existing patterns to find solutions where **only one correct answer exists.** Option A directly reflects this: the ability to distinguish correct answers from incorrect ones.

Let’s look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Rakkoo tokkoof maloota haaraa fayyadamuu** – This describes *divergent* thinking, which is about generating many new ideas, not finding the single correct one.
*   **C: Rakkoolee furuuf yeroo fudhatanii hojjachuu** – This is about efficiency, not the *type* of thinking.
*   **D: Patarniii ykn caasawwan sammuutti qabachuu** – While convergent thinkers *use* patterns, this isn't the defining characteristic of the thinking style itself. The key is using patterns to find the *right* answer."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, xiyyeeffannoo yaada deebii sirrii tokko qofa deebisuu (convergent thinking) kan hin taane kami?","Correct answer is **B: Yeroo nama biraa fudhachuu**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a thought process focused on finding *the* correct answer, logical reasoning, and objectivity.  It emphasizes independent thought and critical evaluation.

* **Convergent thinking** is about narrowing down possibilities to arrive at a single, correct solution.

Let's look at why the other options are related to convergent thinking, and why B is different:

* **A: Deebii tokko qofatu jira jedhanii hubachuu** (Believing only one answer exists) - This is *central* to convergent thinking.
* **C: Odeeffannoo dhugaa gargar baasuu** (Distinguishing true information) - This is a component of the logical reasoning required for convergent thinking.
* **D: Odeeffannoo sassaabuu** (Analyzing information) - This is also a step in evaluating options and arriving at the correct answer.

* **B: Yeroo nama biraa fudhachuu** (Accepting someone else's time) - This is irrelevant to the thought process described. It doesn’t relate to *how* someone thinks or solves problems.  In fact, the passage implies independent thought.  Simply accepting someone's time doesn't contribute to the focused, logical analysis needed to find a single correct answer.

Therefore, accepting someone else's time is the only option that doesn’t fit within the framework of a thought process focused on converging towards a single, correct solution."

Here's why:

* **Micro-expressions** are brief, involuntary facial expressions that reveal a person’s true emotions. They happen very quickly and are difficult to consciously control.
* The passage discusses how subtle facial cues can reveal a person’s emotional state. 

Let's look at the options:

*   **B: Nyaara guuruu** - A smile is a clear facial expression that can convey emotion.
*   **C: Dafanii ija libsachuu** -  Blinking rapidly can be a sign of nervousness or deception.
*   **D: Quba abuudduu ol qabanii agarsiisuu** - Raising eyebrows is a common expression of surprise or questioning.
*   **A: Osoo dubbatanuu gidduun bakka biraa ilaaluu** - Looking around while speaking is a behavior, but it’s not an *expression* that reveals a specific, immediate emotion. It could indicate disinterest, distraction, or dishonesty, but it isn't a fleeting, involuntary facial *expression* like the others.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the video *revealed* existing micro-expressions, it didn't *cause* suspicion.** It was the analysis of the subtle facial movements that led to potential insights, not the recording itself.
* **B: Hiikni sirriin soba adda baasuu mala** (Accurate interpretation can distinguish truth) - This is supported by the passage (""Addumaan, ibsawwan xixiqqoo sirriitti hiikuudhaan namni tokko sobaa jiraachuu isaa adda baasuun ni danda’ama jedhamee falmama"").
* **C: Haasan akkasumas mallattoon fuulaa hiika qaba** (Speech and facial expressions have meaning) - This is a core idea presented in the text.
* **D: Dhugummaa adda baasuf gargaaruu ni danda’a** (It can help reveal the truth) - The passage suggests this is a potential outcome of analyzing micro-expressions.

It highlights the importance of *receiving information* (""itti dhiyaatanii odeeffannoo fudhatan""). This directly aligns with the idea of ""Odeeffannoo argachuu"" (acquiring information).

The passage emphasizes the ability to *acquire* knowledge and the *change* in knowledge (""beekumsa kana argachuuti fi jijjiramaa baruuf kan akkasitti reetii ka’amee caala ibsamee kan beekumsi isaa akka jijjiramee beekamee"").  It also highlights the spread of knowledge (""babal’ina beekumsaa fida"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dhuunfan waa yaadachuu** (Personal remembering) - While memory is involved, the passage focuses on gaining *new* knowledge, not just remembering what was already known.
* **C: Ergaa gabaabaa yaadachuu** (Remembering short messages) - This is too specific and doesn't capture the broader idea of knowledge acquisition.
* **D: Tatamsa’ina odeeffannoo** (Information bias) -  The passage doesn't discuss bias; it's about the *process* of learning and the *expansion* of knowledge.

The passage focuses on the *social* and *personal* benefits of the internet - learning, community, self-disclosure, and strengthening relationships. 

*   **B: Maatii wajjin wal-qunnamuu (Connecting with family)** - This aligns with strengthening relationships, a key theme.
*   **C: Deemsa qorachuu (Seeking information/learning)** - The passage explicitly mentions ""barachuu"" (learning) as a core use of the internet.
*   **D: Namoota haaraa qunnamuu (Meeting new people)** - This fits with ""hawaasomsuun"" (socializing) and building new connections.

*   **A: Walitti-hidhamiinsa daldalaaf (Commercial transactions)** – While the internet is *used* for commerce, the passage doesn't discuss it. It's focused solely on the *social* and *relationship-building* aspects.  The text's framing is around personal connection, not financial gain.

The passage focuses on the *social* and *personal* elements of internet use – learning, community, personal fulfillment, and relationships.  It talks about how the internet enhances these aspects.

Let's look at each option:

*   **A: Qajeelfama akkaataa itti waa hojjatan ilaaluu** (Looking up how-to guides) - This relates to *learning* which is directly mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: Boordii marii onlaayinii irratti maxxansuu** (Posting on online forums) - This relates to *community* and *social interaction*.
*   **C: Meeshaalee waldhaansa fayyaa qorachuu** (Checking health insurance details) - This is a *practical, transactional* use of the internet, focused on healthcare administration. It doesn't fit the described focus on social and personal enrichment.
*   **D: Faayinaansiwwan bulchuu** (Managing finances) - While useful, this is also a *practical* task, a tool for managing something in the real world. It doesn't inherently relate to the social and relational aspects the passage highlights.

Therefore, **checking health insurance details** is the option least connected to the themes of personal fulfillment, learning, and social connection discussed in the text."
Awuwrooppan lixaa yoom warra dhiibbaa godhan irratti hirkachuu dhiisun adeemsa mataasaa tolfachuu eegale?,"The correct answer is **A: Naannoo dhuma Bara Giddu Galeessaa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dhuma bara giddu galeessa warreen Lixa Awuurroppaatti warreen achii haala jireenya mataa isaanii uummachuu jalqaban."" This directly translates to ""Towards the end of the Middle Ages, people in Western Europe began to create their own way of life.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yeroo Bizaantaayin** - The passage mentions Byzantines in relation to early disapproval of long hairstyles, but not as the time when Europeans started establishing their own styles.
* **C: Bara Giddu Galeessaa booda naannoo waggaa 25** - While the passage mentions hairstyles lasting 25-30 years, this refers to the *duration* of a trend, not when Europeans began to differentiate themselves.
* **D: Naannoo jaarraa 11ffaa** - The passage mentions the 10th-11th and 14th centuries as times when specific hairstyles were popular, but not as the starting point for independent style development.

Batanii fayyadamuun wayyaa cufachuun maalirraa kan ka’eedha? ,"The correct answer is **C: Kiruseediwwan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Guddina cimaa yeroo Sanaa sababa **kiiruseedin** namootni uffata safiisaf ta’uu uffachu jalqaban."" This directly links the practice of frequent bathing (and therefore, cleanliness) to the spread of diseases (viruses).  The text implies that people started bathing *because* of viruses and a desire for hygiene during a time of increased disease.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bara Gootik:** While the passage mentions the Gothic period, it doesn't directly link it to the increased bathing.
*   **B: Bara Bizaantaayin:** The passage mentions Byzantine fashion being opposed to long hair, but not bathing habits.
*   **D: Bara Giddu Galeessaa:** The passage notes a change in lifestyle in late medieval Europe, but the *reason* for increased bathing is linked to viruses.

"Akkaataa kutichaattit, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa rakkoo naannotiif furmaata yeroo dheeraa ta’ee kan fudhatamu kamiidha?","Correct answer: **D: Michuu sochii kunuunsa naannoo ta’uu**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the need to deeply understand and address the *root causes* of problems, not just seek quick fixes (""furmaata yeroo gabaabaa qofa hinbarbaannu...hundee rakkoowwan sanniinii bira ga’uu fi balleessuu qabna"").  

* **Michuu sochii kunuunsa naannoo ta’uu** (Participating in local awareness movements) aligns with this. It implies a sustained effort to understand local issues, address their underlying causes, and work towards long-term solutions through community involvement.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Jireenya baasii guddaa qabu dhiisuu** (Giving up an extravagant lifestyle): While potentially helpful, this is a personal choice and doesn't address the systemic issues described in the passage.
* **B: Aktivistummaa** (Activism):  Activism *can* be part of a long-term solution, but the passage stresses *understanding the root causes* first. Activism without that understanding might not be effective.
* **C: Sababa rakkinichaa adda baasuu** (Identifying the cause of the problem): Identifying the problem is a first step, but the passage goes further, saying we need to *address* those root causes.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, haalota armaan gadii keessaa mala mallattoodhan rakkoo naannoo furuutti kan hin ilaalamne kami?","Correct answer is **C: Waa’ee jireenya qaalii ta’e jiraachuu yaada dhiyeessuu**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes a need for **deep, systemic change** to address root causes of problems, not just quick fixes. It mentions analyzing political situations, and addressing issues stemming from population growth and human lifestyles. 

Let's break down why the other options *are* aligned with the passage's message:

*   **A: Hojii aktivizimii keessatti hirmaachuu** (Participating in activism) - This aligns with the idea of actively engaging in local issues and potentially pushing for changes.
*   **B: Rakkoolef sababa ijoo kan ta’e hambisuu** (Reducing the core causes of problems) - This directly reflects the passage's call to address the *foundations* of problems, not just surface-level symptoms.
*   **D: Jireenya naannof mijataa ta’e jiraachuu** (Living a sustainable local life) -This relates to considering the impact of human lifestyle and population which are mentioned in the text.

However, ""Waa’ee jireenya qaalii ta’e jiraachuu yaada dhiyeessuu"" (Giving opinions about a valuable life) is more about expressing a desired outcome or personal philosophy. While valuable, it doesn't directly address the *action* of analyzing and dismantling the systemic issues the passage focuses on. It's a reflection *on* the solution, not a step *towards* it.

Therefore, option C is the least connected to the passage’s call for active, analytical, and systemic problem-solving."
Waraanni jalqabaa kaayyonsaa dhimma aangoo malee dhimma amantii hin taane Awurooppaa biyya kam keessatti ture?,"The correct answer is **D: Ispeen**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lolli Dhaaltummmaa Ispeenotaa yeroo jalqabaaf kan galma ga’e dhimma giddu galaa aangoo ittiin madaalchisuuti."" This translates to ""The Spanish Succession War was the first time a conflict achieved a central issue of power rather than religion."" 

Therefore, the first war in Europe where the primary concern was power (rather than religion) was the Spanish Succession War, making Spain the correct answer."
Yeroo tokko tokko “waraana amantii” isa dhumaa jedhamee kan ibsamu waranaa kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Waraana Waggaa Soddomaa**.

The passage explicitly states: ""kanaaf, Waraanni Waggaa Soddomaa waraana amantaa isaa dhumaa kan jedhamu ta’a."" (Therefore, the Thirty Years' War is considered its last religious war.)"
Amaloota (aspects) Waldaa Kaatoliikii armaan gadii keessaa kan adda bahaa hin turre kami?,"Correct answer is **A: Qoodinsi qabeenyaa Waldattii keessatti sirrii yoo hin turre**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage directly discusses financial corruption within the Catholic Church.** It states that the belief that wealth could absolve sins led to abuse, and the long-standing leader in Rome was suspected of wrongdoing due to his wealth and power. This points to a problem with the *distribution* of wealth and a lack of proper financial accountability.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bu’uurriwwan amantichaa jijjiiramuu qaba yoo ta’e** - The passage emphasizes that despite cultural differences, Christianity *unified* Europe for centuries. This suggests a resistance to changing core beliefs, not a desire for change.
*   **C: Waldattii keessatti aangon qaama tokko harkatti baay’achuu** - The passage mentions the Pope's immense power and suspicion surrounding his actions, indicating an overconcentration of authority. This *is* mentioned.
*   **D: Bu’uurriwwan ijoo waldattii guutamaa ture yoo ta’e** - The passage implies the opposite; the corruption and abuse of power suggest a failure to uphold the core principles of the Church.

Therefore, the passage *specifically* highlights issues with wealth and its misuse within the Catholic Church, making option A the answer.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, Versaayilasitti kan ajjeefame eenyu ture?","The correct answer is **D: Eegduu**.

The text states: ""Bakka ta’ee tokko irratti miseensi mobicha eegdu sooreesicha du’eeti harkaa kaase ture kan Versayileesiti giftii aarte fuulduraati du’ee."" This translates to: ""At one point, a guard overseeing the mob died with a spear stuck in him in front of the gate of Versailles.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dubartoota gabaa keessaa tokko** (One of the market women) - The text doesn't mention a market woman being killed.
*   **B: Mootii Louis XVI** (King Louis XVI) - The text says the King *returned* to Paris, it doesn't say he was killed at Versailles.
*   **C: Miseensa garee hokkaraa** (Member of the guard) - While the person was a guard, the text specifically mentions he was *overseeing the mob* (eegduu).



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessa kan Mooticha ykn Giiftittii irratti garee hokkaraan (the mob) irratti hin fe’amne kami?,"Correct answer: **C: Eegdun yeroo fannifamu ilaaluu**

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Bakka ta’ee tokko irratti miseensi mobicha eegdu sooreesicha du’eeti harkaa kaase ture kan Versayileesiti giftii aarte fuulduraati du’ee."" This directly tells us that an official *was killed* while guarding, meaning the mob directly attacked someone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Banamuu foddaa konkolaataa isaanii:** The text explicitly states ""Tuuti namoota aariin guutanii Mootii fi Giiftiin foddaawwan konkolaataa isaanii bal’isanii akka bananiif dirqisiisan."" (They forced the King and Queen to display their carriage doors.)
*   **B: Versaayilas keessaa tasa bahuu:** The passage begins by describing how the mob forced the royal family to leave Versailles and go to Paris.
*   **D: Deemsa gara Paarisitti deebi’uu:** The passage states that the mob marched the royal family from Versailles *to* Paris. ( ""...mormii baay’ina dubartoota gabaa keessa galaan humnan Varsiilasii irraa gara Paariistti deebifamani."")"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessa bu’aa waraana galaanarraa Biriiteen kan idilee hin taanee kan hin turre kami?,"Correct answer: **C: Seera idil-addunyaarratti jijjiiramatu ta’ee ture**

Here's why:

The passage states that Britain's actions, even though potentially violating international agreements from the past two eras, were justified by the need to stop German aggression and protect its interests. This implies Britain was willing to challenge or alter the existing world order (seera idil-addunyaa) to achieve its goals. The passage doesn't suggest Britain was *unwilling* to change international law – rather, it suggests they acted *despite* it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fedhii Jarman tooftaa waraanaa wal-fakkaataa fayyadamuu barbaaduu** - The text doesn't mention Germany wanting to use a similar naval warfare tactic.
*   **B: Dooniwwan hin hirmaanne bifa miidhamaniin kaa’aman** - The text says Britain sought to prevent ships from reaching enemy ports, implying they were intercepting ships, but it doesn't focus on the condition of those ships.
*   **D: Dhiyeessiwwan bu’uuraa argachuun rakkisaa ture** - The passage doesn't mention difficulties in obtaining fundamental resources.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa humni galaanaa Biriiteen Jarmanitti karaa cufuu sirriitti kan hin ibsine kami?,"Correct Answer: **C: Daandii dhiyeessii Jarman jalaa danqe**

Here's why:

*   **The Passage Focuses On:** The passage describes Britain establishing a naval blockade of Germany during wartime. It emphasizes restricting the supply of goods *to* Germany, not actively interfering with German supply routes.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

*   **A: Faallaa seera idil-addunyaa ture:** The passage explicitly states the blockade violated international laws and agreements.
*   **B: Lola doonii waraanaa galaana jalaa Jarman akka eegalu godhe:** The passage indicates Britain intended to prevent war vessels from Germany operating in the seas.
*   **D: Dooniwwan keessaa hin qabne ykn hin hirmaanne akka hin miidhamne mirkaneesse:** The passage mentions Britain stating neutral ships (those not carrying contraband) wouldn't be attacked.

**Therefore, the passage does *not* directly state that Britain interfered with Germany's export/supply routes - only its import routes.**"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’un, qorannoon rakkoo dugdaafi sammuu (Multiple Sclerosis) eenyuf gorfama?","The correct answer is **A: Dubartii waggaa 32**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Shamarran MS qabaachuudhaan dachaa lama dhiiraa ta’u."" This means women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
* **The passage also indicates:** MS primarily affects young adults and middle-aged individuals.
* **Option A (Dubartii waggaa 32 - 32-year-old woman)** fits both criteria: she is a woman, and 32 falls within the young to middle-aged range.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dhiira waggaa 15 (15-year-old boy)** - While MS *can* occur in younger individuals, it's less common and the passage emphasizes it affecting young adults and middle-aged people.  More importantly, men are *less* likely to have MS.
* **C: Dhiira waggaa 43 (43-year-old man)** - While the age is appropriate, the passage says men are less likely to get MS.
* **D: Dubartii waggaa 10 (10-year-old girl)** - This age is too young for MS to be the primary consideration based on the text.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, hirmaattonni hojii idilee keessa jiran maalif deeggarsa dabalataa barbaadu?","The correct answer is **A: Dhukkubbii bifa negatiivan fudhachuu (To accept the disease in a negative way)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that participants in the ""gocha idilee"" (work/activity) need extensive support ""akkaataa hubbannoo cimina dhukkubbii irratti hundaa’uudhaan"" (based on a deeper understanding of the disease). This implies they struggle to cope with the disease and its implications – essentially, accepting the disease negatively.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dugda gara gadii (Lower back)** - While the disease affects the spine, the passage isn't about needing support *because* of the location of the pain. It's about the *psychological* impact.
* **C: Dhiphina (Difficulty)** - Difficulty is too broad. The passage specifies the need for support relating to understanding the disease.
* **D: Sodaa (Anxiety)** - While anxiety is mentioned as a symptom (""sodaanii""), the passage focuses on the need for support to *understand* and *cope* with the disease, not just manage anxiety.  The support is deeper than just treating a symptom.



"
"Akaataa kutichaatti, taphni billaa (fencing) yeroo heddu akkamitti taphatama?","The correct answer is **D: Bifa lolaan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ispoortiichi yeroo baayyee akkaataa falmii lolaa nama lama giddutti gaggeffamutti taphatama, daangaa kan qabu tokko nama biraa falmuun.""  This translates to ""Sport is often practiced as a competition between two people, one trying to overcome the other.""

Fencing (billaa) is a sport *defined* by this one-on-one competitive format (lola). The other options refer to levels of competition (university, Olympics) or a general way sports can be (bifa ammayyaan - a form of exercise), but don't describe *how* fencing is played.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa agarsiistuu cimaa summaa’uu keessoo kan ta’e kami?","The correct answer is **A: Haqqee fi qaama gubaa (Burning sensation and body burning)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a poisoning where symptoms aren't immediately obvious and suggests looking for things like a strange odor or corrosive chemicals in the house. Burning sensations are a *very* common and direct symptom of many types of poisoning (acid, alkali, etc.).

Let's look at why the other options are less likely to be the *most* indicative of a hidden poisoning:

* **B: Ol-deebisuufi dafqisiisuu (Vomiting and Diarrhea):** While these can be symptoms of poisoning, they are also symptoms of many other illnesses. They're not specific enough to immediately suggest poisoning.
* **C: Maashan garmalee walitti goguu fi dhukkubbii garaa (Muscle cramping and headache):** These are *possible* symptoms, but also very general and could indicate many different problems.
* **D: Qaruura qorichaa ajaja ogeessaa qabdu (Having a strange odor in the house with an expert):**  The passage *mentions* looking for strange odors, but the odor itself isn't a symptom *you feel*. It's a clue to investigate.

Therefore, **burning sensation and body burning** is the strongest indication of poisoning described in the text."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, yeroo dhukkubsataa ykn nama miidhame qoratan waanti murteessan jalqaba godhamuu qabu maali?","The correct answer is **A: Naannicha ilaali** (Look around).

Here's why, based on the provided text:

The text emphasizes prioritizing your own safety first (""dursaa taatee bakkichaa qorachuu qabda nageenyakee mirkaaneeffachuuf"" - first look around to ensure your safety).  Before approaching someone who is hurt or potentially dangerous, you need to assess the situation and make sure *you* won't be put in harm's way.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nama miidhame sanatti dhiyaadhu** (Approach the injured person) - The text warns against this *before* assessing the situation. Rushing in could put you at risk.
* **C: Namni miidhame kallattii inni itti ciisu hubadhu** (Understand how the injured person is breathing) - While important eventually, it's not the *first* thing to do.  Safety first!
* **D: Deeggarsa eegi** (Seek help) -  Seeking help is good, but *after* you've quickly assessed your surroundings for immediate danger.



"
Himoota armaan gadii keessaa adeemsa nama miidhame ilaaluu sirriitti kan hin ibsine kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Nan miidham jettee hin yaadda’in**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes *recognizing* potential dangers and being aware of your surroundings to *prevent* becoming a victim. It talks about remembering the characteristics of victims and protecting yourself. Saying ""I don't think I'll be victimized"" (which is what option A translates to) is the *opposite* of the proactive, observant behavior the passage advocates. It's a denial of the possibility, not a step in assessing a situation involving a potential attacker.

Let's look at why the other options *do* align with the passage:

* **B: Nama miidhame dura naannoo ilaali** - This means ""Look around before someone attacks you,"" which directly relates to being aware of your surroundings.
* **C: Namni miidhame kallattii inni itti ciisu ilaali** - This means ""Watch the way a victim behaves,"" meaning you should remember the behaviors of people who are attacked.
* **D: Alaaban ykn mallattoon diiman jiraachuu adda baasi** - This means ""Identify suspicious signs or flags,"" meaning you should pay attention to possible warning signs.

Therefore, only option A doesn't relate to the advice given in the passage."
Jijjiiramoota Warraaqsa Faransaayi keessaa lammiilee hojjattoota ta’an irratti dhiibbaa cimaa kan fide kami?,"Correct answer: **B: Xiyyeeffannoon murna (class) irraa gara wal-dorgommiitti jijjiiramuu**

Here's why:

The text states the shift from ""sirrummaa irraa gara biyyummaa"" (from privilege to citizenship) and that the revolution benefitted those with ""hawwii qabaniifi milkii qaban"" (desires and property - implying the rising bourgeoisie). This indicates a move *away* from a system based on inherited status (murna/class) and *towards* a system based on merit and the ability to participate in the nation (wal-dorgommiitti - competition/participation).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Biyyattiif deeggarsi dabaluu (Increasing support for the nation):** While nationalism grew, the text doesn't specifically highlight this as *a change brought about by* the French Revolution for working-class people.
*   **C: Ilaalchi Rippaabilikaa fudhatamuu (Acceptance of Republicanism):** The text alludes to this, but doesn't focus on it as a change specifically affecting working-class people.
*   **D: Mala safaraa haaraa (New voting methods):** The text mentions electoral systems (""sirna safaraa"") but doesn't say a *new* system was the key shift benefitting the working class.



"
"Warraaqsa Faransaayi booda, waraanafi hojii biraan milkaa’un hamma tokko (less likely) maalirratti kan hundaa’edha?","The correct answer is **C: Fedhii (Desire)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Warraaqsa boodas hojiin dhiirota gaafataniif banaa ture kunis kan hawwii qabaniifi milkii qaban akka milkaawan godhee jira."" This translates to ""After the French Revolution, the work that was revealed for strong men was made to be realized by those who have desire and ownership."" 

This clearly indicates that success (milkaa'in) *after* the revolution is based on **desire (fedhii)** and ownership, not simply rank, milkaa'ina itself, or morality.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Milkaa’ina (Success)** - The text states success is *achieved* through desire, not *based* on it.
*   **B: Sadarkaa (Rank)** - The text implies a shift *away* from rank as the basis for success.
*   **D: Amala ykn qulqullina (Morality/Integrity)** - The text doesn't mention morality or integrity as a factor."
Biyyoota guddatan keessatti tajaajila uummataa kamtu gammaduu dhabuu guddaadhaf sababa ta’a?,"The correct answer is **A: Qulqullina bishaanii (Water quality)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Biyyoota guddatan keessa komiiwwan sadarkaa walfakataa waa’ee **qulquullinna bishaanii** yookiin caabiinsa riqichawwaniitu dhagahama."" (In developed countries, complaints are often heard at various levels regarding **water quality** or sewage issues.)

The question asks what service causes the greatest dissatisfaction in developed countries. The passage directly identifies water quality as a frequent source of complaint.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Ijaarsa riqichaa (Sewage construction):** While sewage issues are mentioned alongside water quality, the passage doesn't state it's a *greater* source of dissatisfaction.
*   **C: Geejjiba uummataa (Public infrastructure):** This is too broad. The passage focuses on specific infrastructure problems (water and sewage).
*   **D: Barnoota (Education):** Education isn't mentioned as a source of dissatisfaction in the passage.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, waa’ee maloota geejjiba uummataa maaltu jedhamuu danda’a?","The correct answer is **C: Namoonni baay’en isaan fayyafaman akka komii kaasaniif sabab** (Because many people who are served end up complaining).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on complaints about water quality or rationing in developed countries despite the existence of infrastructure.** This directly implies that the *system itself* is causing dissatisfaction for many people.
* **Option A** is too positive; the passage is about *problems* with the system, not universal love for it.
* **Option B** focuses on water quality, which is *a* problem mentioned, but not the core of why the system fails to achieve success daily.
* **Option D** is about the *presence* of the system in developed nations, not *why* it’s failing to satisfy people.

The question asks for a statement about the *problems* with infrastructure (geejjibaa) from a user perspective. The passage highlights the paradox of having infrastructure yet still facing significant public complaints. Therefore, option C best captures that central idea.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, sababa konkolaachistoota tilmaamun rakkisaa ta’eef kanneen armaan gadii keessaa safaruuf rakkisaa kan ta’u kamiidha?","The correct answer is **A: Saffisa tiraafikaa (Traffic speed)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Akka carraa ta’ee, akkaataa sochii tiraafikaa qo’achuun rakkisaadha, sababnisaas amalli konkolaachistootaa parsantii dhibbaan tilmaamuuf nama rakkisa."" (As a result, tracking traffic patterns is difficult because it is difficult to describe the behavior of drivers in percentage terms).  Later it continues ""kanaafuu, konkolaataawwan walduukaa yaa’an walfakkaattummaa sababa qabu hanga tokko qabu, akkasumas herregaan shallagamanii ibsamuu danda’u."" (Therefore, vehicles intending to merge have some commonality of cause and can be predicted). This points to speed being a key factor.  If drivers aren't consistently following a speed, or if speeds vary wildly, it makes prediction (and therefore tracking patterns) much harder.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Karoora daandii baasuu (Road exit planning):** While important, exit planning doesn't directly influence the *difficulty* of describing driver behavior as a percentage.
* **C: Hojii daandii (Road work):** Road work can *affect* traffic, but it's not the fundamental reason why driver behavior is hard to quantify.
* **D: Toora Tiraafikaa (Traffic flow):** This is too general. The passage focuses on the difficulty in *describing* driver behaviour, which is directly linked to unpredictable speed.



"
Herreegan yeroo istiriimii tiraafikaa (traffic stream) bakka buufamu kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu fayidaarra oola?,"The correct answer is **C: Dizaayinii daandii (Road design)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hariiroon kunneen karoorsuu, **dizaayinii**, fi hojii tajaajila daandii-qaxxaamuraa keessatti ni gargaaru."" (These relationships are helpful in planning, **design**, and operation of traffic control services.)

The passage describes how understanding traffic flow, driver behavior, and the three characteristics (volume, density, speed) are crucial for *designing* roads effectively.  This ties directly into herreegaan (characteristics/metrics) being used to *replace* the difficulty of understanding individual driver behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hojii daandii (Traffic operation)** - While related, the passage focuses on the *foundation* for effective operation – the design itself.
*   **B: Amala konkolaachisaa (Driver behavior)** - The passage actually states that understanding individual driver behavior is *difficult*, and these characteristics are used as a replacement for that understanding.
*   **D: Rukkina tiraafikaa (Traffic congestion)** - Congestion is a *result* of traffic flow, not a fundamental characteristic used in design.



"
Hersheyfi Chase Qaccee Sanyii (DNA) isaanii dhaabuf maal fayyadaman? ,"Correct answer is **C: Reediyoo aktivii salfarii**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Hershey and Chase used radioactive sulfur to label the protein coats of the viruses. Sulfur is found in the amino acids that make up proteins, but not in DNA. Therefore, tracking the radioactive sulfur helped them determine if the protein was entering the bacteria.
*   Option A (radioactive phosphorus) was used to label DNA, not the protein coat.
*   Option B (genetic material) is a general term and doesn't specify the tool they used.
*   Option D (viruses) were the *vehicles* for delivery, but not the *label* itself."
Dandeettin jijjiiramuu (mutation) gara ilmootti darbuuf maal irratti hirkata?,"Correct answer: **C: Gosa jijjiirama (mutation type)**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Jijjaramoota seeliiwwan sarara-jarmii keessaa qofatu gara daa’immaniitti darbuu danda’a, jijjiramoonni bakkeewwan biroo garuu du’a seelii yookiin kaansarii fiduu danda’u.""  This translates to: ""Only mutations in germ cells (reproductive cells) can be passed on to offspring, while mutations in other cells can cause cell death or cancer.""

Therefore, whether a mutation is passed on to offspring depends on *the type of mutation* – specifically, whether it occurs in a germ cell or not.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Seelonni kan jarmii seelota duraanii irraa uumaman yoo ta’an (Whether cells are formed from the germ cells of the parents):** While it's true offspring get their cells from parents, this doesn't determine *if* a mutation is passed on, just *where* the genetic material comes from.
*   **B: Barbaachisummaa wantota uumamaa ta’anii (The necessity of inherited traits):** This is a general concept about inheritance but doesn't explain the mechanism of mutation transmission.
*   **D: Jijjiirama yoo seelin akka du’u godhe (Mutation if it causes the cell to die):** Mutations that cause cell death are *not* passed on, so this isn't the determining factor for inheritance.

"Odeeffannoo kuticha keessatti kenname irratti hundaa’un, jijjiiramni garaa garaa kan irratti hin hundoofne maalidha?","Correct Answer: **D: Gosa jijjiirama miidhamee**

Here's why:

The passage states that only changes in germ cells (sarara seeliin jarmii qabatee) can be passed down to offspring. Changes in other cells either lead to cell death or cancer.  Therefore, the *type* (gosa) of change matters – it has to be a germ cell mutation to be heritable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wantoota genetikii hagamtu miidhame:** The passage doesn't discuss *how much* genetic material is altered, only *where* the alteration occurs.
*   **B: Seelonni miidhaman kan jarmii seelota duraanii irraa uumaman yoo ta’an:** This describes how cells are formed and doesn't relate to the heritability of changes.
*   **C: Barbaachisummaa wantoota genetikii miidhamanii:**  The passage doesn't focus on the importance of mutations, but rather their location and consequences.

The passage states that early humans started ""of bira tursuu"" (cooperating/gathering) to easily obtain *aannan* (milk), *rifeensa* (roots), *foonii* (fruits), and *gogaa salphaatti* (easily obtainable things).  It also mentions companionship (""Hiriyaa namaaf ta’u"") and providing food (""Annan namaaf kennu"").  

However, there's nothing in the passage about early humans cooperating to help each other dig the land (""Lafa akka dheedan gargaari""). The focus is on *gathering* existing resources, not *creating* or *modifying* the land itself.

Therefore, B is the only option that isn't a stated reason for early human cooperation.



"
Kaayyon golfii waanta xiqqaa hammamii fudhachuudha?,"Correct answer is **B: Istookiwwan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Taphataan istirookii tiqqoo fudhatu..."" which translates to ""The golfer takes a firm grip on the club..."" This directly indicates that clubs (istookii) are a key component of golf.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kubbaawwan (Balls):** While balls are essential, the question asks what a golfer *takes* or *holds* - they take a grip on a club, not a ball.
*   **C: Yeroo (Time):** Time is a factor in golf, but not something held or taken.
*   **D: Boollawwan (Holes):** Holes are the *target* of golf, not something a golfer holds.



"
Tapha golfii keessatti margi kan gabaabbatu eessatti?,"The correct answer is **B: Bakka magariisatti**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Taphichi marga irratti kan taphatamuufi margi naannoo boollaa jiru kan gabaabsamee haamame magariisa jedhama."" This directly translates to ""The game is played on a course, and the area around the hole that is marked and separated is called a 'magariisa'."" 

Therefore, the course is marked/gabbaabbatu at the *magariisa* (around the hole)."
Kaayyon qorannoo inni ijoon kamiidha?,"The correct answer is **B: Addunyaan akkaataa itti hojjattu baruuf** (To learn how the world works).

Here's why:

* **The passage states directly:** ""Kaayyoon saayintistootaa inni guddaan karaa mala qorannootiin akkaataa biyyi lafaa itti hojjetu bira ga’uudha."" (The main purpose of scientists is to understand how the world works through the method of research).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yaadota (hypotheses) tokko ykn lama balleessuuf** (To disprove one or two ideas) - While testing and potentially disproving hypotheses *is* part of scientific research, it's not the overarching *purpose*.
* **C: Gaaffii dhiyeessuf** (To ask questions) - Asking questions is important, but it's a step *within* the research process, not the ultimate goal.
* **D: Qorannoo saayinsaawaa gaggeessuf** (To conduct scientific research) - This describes *how* scientists work, not *why* they work.  It's a circular answer.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, qorannoo saayinsaawaa gaggeessuf kan hin gargaarre maalidha?","The correct answer is **C: Yaadota jiraachuu malan balleessuu** (Destroying pre-existing notions).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that scientific inquiry isn't *just* about following a method.** It highlights the importance of challenging existing ideas (""yaadota jiraachuu malan balleessuu""), forming hypotheses, and being open to disproving them. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mala saayinsaawaa qofaa** (Only the scientific method) - The passage *specifically* states it's not *only* about the method.
* **B: Ilaaluu** (Observing) - Observation is a *part* of the scientific method, but the passage says more is needed.
* **D: Qorannoo gaggeessuu** (Conducting research) - This is a general term and doesn't pinpoint what the passage emphasizes as being *in addition* to the method.



Therefore, the passage suggests that actively questioning and potentially overturning pre-conceived notions is crucial for effective scientific inquiry, making option C the best answer."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, waa’ee torneedoo himni sirrii hin taane kami?","The correct answer is **C: Torneedowwan harki caalan sa’aatii sadii ol turu**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Tornadoon hamman kan parsantii lamaa ta’uu sa’aatii sadiif tura."" (Tornadoes usually last for two hours and up to three hours).

This directly contradicts option C, which says they can last *more* than three hours.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: Torneedon waan bakkicha jiru hunda balleessuu danda’a** - The text states they ""barbadeesu wanta daandii isaanirra jiran hunda"" (destroy everything in their path).
* **B: Torneedon akka bubbee hamaa osoo hin taane naannoo muraasa miidha** - The text says they take up a ""bakka xiqqoo"" (small space) but cause significant damage.  While devastating, it’s localized.
* **D: Torneedowwan tokko tokko bubbee saa’aatitti maayilii hanga 300 deemuu qabaachuu danda’a** -  The text says the wind speed can reach 480 km/h which translates to approximately 300 mph (miles per hour).



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’un, himoota armaan gadii keessaa torneedowwan harka caalu sirriitti kan ibsu kamiidha?","The correct answer is **C: Bubbeewwan kaan caalaa naannoo heddu miidhu.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Toornaadoon bubbeewwan jeeqoo biroo waliin yommuu madaalamtu bakka xiqqoo qabatu, garuu wanta daandii isaanirra jiran hunda barbadeesu."" (Tornadoes, when compared to other storm winds, occupy a small area, but destroy everything in their path.) This clearly indicates tornadoes cause *more* damage over a smaller area than other winds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yeroo heddu sa’aatii sadii ol turu** - The text says tornadoes *last* up to three hours, not that they often last *more* than three hours.
* **B: Bubbee sa’aatitti naannoo maayilii 480 deemuu danda’u uumu** - The text states the wind speed is 480 km/h, not that the tornado travels 480 miles in an hour. It’s the *speed of the wind* within the tornado, not the tornado's travel speed.
* **D: Muka hundeen buqqisuuf dandeettii qaba** - While the text says tornadoes can uproot trees (""muka hiddaan buqisa""), it doesn't say they can uproot *all* trees.

Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa ilmi namaa jaarraa 16ffaa keessa hojjachuu kan eegale kamiidha?,"The correct answer is **D: Telekoppiiwwan omishuu** (Making telescopes).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that telescopes were first worked on in Europe in the 16th century. The other options are related to the use of lenses or seeing things better, but the *creation* of telescopes is what the passage highlights as starting in the 16th century.



"
Dhalli namaa leensii fayyadamuun wantota guddisee ilaaluu hammiif gochaa ture?,"The correct answer is **B: Jaarraa 16ffaa gara dhumaatii eegalee**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the first practical telescopes were made in Europe **in the 16th century**. This directly answers the question of when humans started using lenses to see distant objects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Waggaa kuma tokkoof** - This translates to ""for a hundred years,"" which is too short a time frame.
* **C: Waggoota kumaatamaaf** - This translates to ""for two hundred years,"" also too short.
* **D: Jalqaba jaarraa 16ffaa irraa eegalee** - This translates to ""from the beginning of the 16th century,"" but the passage doesn't specify *when* in the 16th century they began being used, only *that* they were used *in* the 16th century. Option B is more precise based on the text.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, ayiraniin yeroo jalqabaaf maalif hojiirra oole?","Correct answer is **B: Karaa konkolaatan fardi harkisu irra deemu**.

Here's why:

The text states the wagons were initially built with good roads in mind, and that they were able to transport goods faster and more efficiently than previous methods. This means that the initial purpose of using iron (ayiraniin) was to improve the wheels of the wagons so they could function better on roads - and eventually replace the reliance on horses. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waa jabeessee qabuuf** - The text doesn't mention storage.
*   **C: Wiilii** - While wheels are involved, the text focuses on the material (iron) being used to *improve* the wagon's movement, not the invention of the wheel itself.
*   **D: Daandii baaburaa** - Cars and roads for cars didn't exist in the 16th century.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, gommaan mukaa kan ayiraniitin maalif bakka bu’ee ture?","Correct answer: **A: Dabaluu saffisa konkolaataa**

Here's why:

The passage states that the new roads (covered in layers of stones) allowed carriages to travel ""at a greater speed"" than before. It also mentions the gradual addition of layers of stone improved the roads. This directly indicates the primary purpose of using stones was to increase the speed of carriages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Caalmatti bu’a qabeessa waan ta’aniif:** While the roads likely became more durable, the passage emphasizes *speed* as the main improvement.
*   **C: Ba’aa guddaa baachuu waan danda’aniif:** The passage doesn’t focus on the *amount* of goods carried, but how *quickly* they were carried.
*   **D: Ayiranii tiraakirra jiruun gadi uwwifamanii turan:** The passage mentions layers being added, but doesn’t state they were specifically being used to lower the road surface.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, bara Romaantisizimii namoota dhuunfaa maaltu yaadasaanii jijjiire?","The correct answer is **B: Haala teessuma lafaa** (The state of earthly existence).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Romanticism (represented by figures like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel) emphasized the *experience of individual earthly existence* (""teessumni lafaa namoota dhuunfaa boce""). This experience was seen as something that contained inherent truths and was often in conflict with societal norms (""seerota akka feeteetti baafaman""). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Seerota (Rules):** While the passage mentions conflict with rules, the core shift in thought wasn't *about* the rules themselves, but about the individual's experience *in relation* to them.
* **C: Barsiifata (Education):** Education isn't directly addressed as the focus of the change.
* **D: Aadaa (Culture):** While Jaalaleessuun (Romanticism) *influenced* culture, the passage is focusing on how it changed the way people thought about their *own existence* within the world.

Himoota armaan gadii keessaa yaada walii galaa ditarminizimii teeknolojii kan hin ibsine kamiidha? ,"Correct answer is **D: Guddinii teknolojii dhiibbaa siyaasaa irratti hin hundaa’u**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that technological development *can* be influenced by political and social forces (""guddinni teeknooloojii mataa isaatiin irra guddinaan karaa dhiibbaa aadaa fi siyaasaa gararraa ta’e hordofuu isaa"").  This directly contradicts option D.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

*   **A: Dhiibban teeknolojiin hawaasarratti qabu hawaasarratti kan hundaa’udha:** The passage discusses how technology impacts society (e.g., the car example shows societal consequences like traffic and accessibility).
*   **B: Guddinni teeknolojii aadadhaan dhiibban irratti hin godhamne:** The passage points to technological advancements having unintended consequences (like the car example with increased accidents and the need for medical advancements to treat injuries).
*   **C: Teeknolojiin hawaasarratti dhiibbaa uumamaa (inherent effects) qaba:** The passage implies that technology *always* has some impact on society, whether intended or not.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, xiyya harkisuu ( pulling the bow) wajjin kan walitti hin dhufne kamiidha?","The correct answer is **A: Sagalee tasgabbaa’aa (A subdued sound)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes ""ol-golbatu"" and ""gadi golbatu"" as powerful and requiring strength, emphasizing a strong, clear sound. It contrasts this with a *weak* sound coming from the frog (laagaan), even though it's frequent.  It also notes the importance of a full, resonant tone.

Let's break down why the other options are related to bow technique described in the passage:

* **B: Mallattoo wal-qabsiistuu fakkaatu (Staple-like marking):** The passage directly mentions these markings being strong and requiring effort.
* **C: Sagalee jabaa (A loud sound):**  The passage focuses on producing a strong and potentially powerful sound.
* **D: Raachatti jalqabuu (Starting at the frog):** The passage mentions the frog area and its characteristic sound (though it notes the sound isn't as strong as elsewhere on the bow).

A *subdued* sound doesn't fit with the forceful and resonant bowing described. Therefore, it's the one that doesn't align with the text's explanation of proper technique.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa sagalee jabaadhan kan wal qabatu kamiidha?","The correct answer is **C: Mallattoo V fakkaatu**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mallattoon “ol-golbatu” V kan fakkkaatuu fi """" mallattoon gadi golbatu"""" akka waan humna qabeessatti ykn iskuwerii dalgeen tokko itti hir’atuuti.""  This directly translates to ""The 'open' or 'V-shaped' sign and the 'downward' sign act like powerful things or someone is screening them."" This establishes the V-shaped sign as being associated with strength/a strong signal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mallattoo fiixensaa lamaan gadi jallate:** (Two downward signs) - The text differentiates between the ""V"" shape and the downward sign.
*   **B: Xiyya harkisuu:** (Hand flexing) - This is described as a different action, not a signal strength indicator.
*   **D: Bakka harki kee xiyya qabaterraa eegaluu:** (Watching where your hand is flexed) -  This refers to observing the hand flexing, not a strong signal itself.



"
Waanti bososaan (fossils) akka agarsiisutti kanneen armaan gadii keessa yeroon booda harki maal hojjachuudhaf fayidaarra oole?,"The correct answer is **A: Waa hojjachuu (Manipulation)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that hominins *didn't* use their hands for locomotion (walking/running) or climbing. Instead, the fossils show a shift in hand evolution over millions of years *towards* being able to grasp and manipulate objects (""gara waa waliin qaqqabuutti godhe sana"").  This is directly linked to developing dexterity for tool use and more complex tasks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ba’aa baachuu (Climbing):** The passage explicitly states hands weren’t used for climbing.
* **C: Sochii (Locomotion):** The passage states hands evolved *away* from being used for locomotion.
* **D: Quba dachaasanii lafa qabatanii deemuu (Knuckle-walking):** While chimpanzees knuckle-walk, the passage is about *hominin* evolution and how their hands became adapted for something *different* than knuckle-walking.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa lafeewwan qubaa (phalanges) chimpaanzii kan sirriitti ibsu kami? ,"Correct answer is **A: Kan namaarra qajeeladha**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Harki namaa miila caala gabaabaadha, lafee qubaa qajeelaa wajjiin."" This directly translates to ""Human hands are shorter than their feet, *with flexible phalanges*.""  This indicates that chimpanzee phalanges (lafee qubaa) are *less* flexible than human phalanges. Therefore, ""kan namaarra qajeeladha"" (more flexible than humans) accurately describes them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Harkiifi miilli isaanii wal caala:** The passage says chimpanzee hands and feet are similar in length, not that one is longer.
*   **C: Ulfaatina qaamaa baachuf gargaaru:** The passage doesn't mention chimpanzee phalanges being used for body balance.
*   **D: Jalqabatti Waa hojjachuuf gargaaru:** While chimpanzees use their hands for tool use, the passage doesn't specifically link that to the flexibility of their phalanges. It focuses on the evolutionary shift *towards* tool use."
Filachuun toora qaccee sanyii (genetic variation) haaraa Puulii kam keessaa balleessa?,"The correct answer is **A: Dhoksaa (Mutation)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Qorannoon jaarraa digdammaffaa garaagarummaan eela sanyii darbuu bifa lamaan akka jiran ni mul'isa: dhokataa fi kan ibsamu.""  This translates to: ""Research on inherited traits shows that genetic variation arises in two forms: mutation and that which is expressed.""
* **The question asks:** Which of Paul's sources of new genetic variation is eliminated by selection?
* **Selection acts *on* expressed traits.**  If a mutation is harmful, selection will eliminate individuals with that mutation. The mutation *itself* is the original source of the variation, but selection acts on how that variation manifests (the expressed trait).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Adeemsa qaccee sanyii organizimii garaa garaarraa walitti fiduu (The process of genetic variation from different organisms interacting):** This describes gene flow, not a source *eliminated* by selection. Gene flow *introduces* variation.
* **C: Adda baasuu (Sorting):** This refers to the process of selection itself, not a source of variation.
* **D: Kan ibsame (That which is expressed):**  Selection acts *on* expressed traits.  It doesn't eliminate the expression itself, but rather individuals *with* certain expressions.  The underlying cause, the mutation, is the source eliminated if the trait is detrimental.



"
Toora qaccee sanyii dabaluuf adeemsa kamtu itti gaafatama?,"The correct answer is **C: Adda bahuu ykn Muteeshinii** (Mutation).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mutations add to the genetic variation, and also select from the different gene pools available."" This directly links mutation to increasing genetic variation.
* **The passage describes two forms of genetic variation:** inherited and mutated. Mutation is the *process* that creates the mutated form of variation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Adda baasuu (Selection):** While selection *acts* on variation, it doesn't *create* it.
* **B: Adeemsa qaccee sanyii organizimii garaa garaarraa walitti fiduu (Gene flow/Interbreeding):**  This shuffles existing genetic variation but doesn't generate new variation.
* **D: Kan ibsame (Expressed):** This refers to traits that are *shown* not the *source* of the variation.

"Odeeffannoo kuticha keessa jirurratti hundaa’un, “rakkoo pirotiinii” furuuf kanneen keessaa nyaata piraayimeetii ta’uu kan qabu kami?","The correct answer is **B: Lewegiyuumiwwan du’an (Dead legumes)**.

Here's why, based on the provided text:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Qabeenyawwan biqiltuu hunda caalaa qophaa’anii dhiyaatan pirootiiniiwwan baalaafi wantoota akka baaqelaa keessatti argaman turan..."" (The most readily available resources are proteins found in grains and things like legumes).
* **It also mentions:** ""...garuu wantoonni kun yoo bilcheeffaman malee bineeldota akka keenyaatiif garaa keessatti bulleessuun rakkisaadha."" (but these are difficult to digest for primates like us unless processed).
* **The text further contrasts this with:** ""...nyaati bineeldotaa (goondaa, miixii, hanqaaquu) salphaati kan daakamu qofa osoo hin taane, pirootiinii qulqullinni isaa ol aanaa kan amiinoo asiidiiwwan murteessoo of keessaa qaban kennu."" (primate food - roots, leaves, fruits - is easily digestible and provides high-quality protein with essential amino acids).

Therefore, legumes (baaqelaa/Lewegiyuumiwwan) are mentioned as a source of protein but needing processing to be usable for primates, making them a solution for ""rakkoo pirotiinii"" if prepared correctly.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baala mukaa du’e (Dead tree bark):** The text does not mention tree bark as a food source for primates or a solution to protein deficiency.
*   **C: Korophisa (Corn):**  Corn isn't directly mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Hundee abaaboo (Fungi):** Fungi aren’t specifically identified as a primary protein source in this passage.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, rakkoolee armaan gadii keessaa hanqina amiinoo asiidiwwan murteessoo ta’aniin kan hin uumamne kami?","The correct answer is **A: Rakkoolee soorata daakuu (Problems with molting)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on protein/amino acid deficiencies.** It explains how insects struggle to get essential amino acids from their food sources, leading to growth problems, abnormal diets, and death.  Molting (shedding of exoskeletons) is related to chitin and other compounds, not directly to amino acid deficiencies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hanqina nyaataa (Food shortage):** The passage directly states insects struggle to get the *right kind* of nutrition, even when food is available, due to the difficulty of extracting amino acids.
* **C: Guddina jijjiirama hin qabne (Stunted growth):** The passage explicitly lists stunted growth as a consequence of amino acid deficiencies.
* **D: Du’a (Death):**  The passage explicitly lists death as a consequence of amino acid deficiencies.



Therefore, molting problems are the only option not directly linked to a lack of essential amino acids as described in the text."

(Members of a cultural group express their identity through style as a means and symbol, including fashion, mannerisms, and aesthetics.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Keessatti of dabaluu yaalun (Trying to blend in):** The passage emphasizes *expression* of cultural identity, not *hiding* it.
* **B: Amantii naannoosaanii jiru hunda ofitti fudhachuun (Accepting all local beliefs):** While acceptance can be part of a culture, the passage doesn't say this is how members show belonging. It focuses on outward expression.
* **C: Duudhaalee hawaasaa ofitti fudhachuun (Accepting community traditions):** Similar to B, acceptance is important, but the passage specifically highlights *expression through style*.

Here's why:

The prompt describes a self-fulfilling prophecy. The belief that children of certain groups are less capable leads to them being treated as such, and *this treatment* causes them to perform poorly.  In the scenario described in the question, the child is *labeled* as likely to exhibit bad behavior because of their small group affiliation.  This labeling will likely lead to the child being treated in a way that encourages or reinforces that behavior, causing them to act it out.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Daa’mni sun amala badaa keessatti hirmaachuu dhiisuu yaala** - This is the opposite of what the prompt describes. The situation actively *causes* the bad behavior.
*   **C: Daa’imni sun haala hawaasaa keessaa ni baha** - While isolation might occur as a *result* of the bad behavior, it's not the primary outcome described by the theory.
*   **D: Daa’mni sun saba xiqqaa biraa wajjin walitti dhufuu ni dida** - This focuses on intergroup relations, which isn't the core issue addressed in the prompt – it’s about the impact of expectation on individual behavior.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that *stereotyping* (the ""qoqqoodinsa sanyummaa"") *affects their behavior* (""amala isaanii ni miidha""). The example given demonstrates how being labeled as a certain group (a group supposedly less capable of learning) can lead to self-fulfilling prophecy and hinder their education.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Saba xiqqaa isaan ittiin of waaman (The small tribe they identify with):** While identity is related, the passage focuses on the *impact* of the stereotype, not simply identifying with a group.
* **C: Walitti dhufeenya ijoollee biroo waliin qaban (Their interactions with other children):** This *could* be affected, but it's not the direct impact the passage highlights.
* **D: Hiika sanyii qaban (The meaning they give to ethnicity):**  The passage doesn't discuss their *understanding* of ethnicity, but the external *imposition* of a stereotype *about* their ethnicity.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states** that ""bineeyyii"" (feral children) are those who haven't been properly socialized.  They haven't had the opportunity to learn social norms and behaviors through interaction with others. This lack of social contact is the core cause of their ""feral"" behavior.
* **Option A** focuses solely on physical abuse, which is mentioned as *one* potential factor in some cases, but not the defining characteristic of feral behavior.
* **Option C** mentions children raised by their families, which is the *opposite* of the situation described for feral children.
* **Option D** suggests intellectual disabilities are the primary cause, which is not supported by the text. While some feral children might have underlying issues, the text emphasizes the *lack of socialization* as the key factor.

Therefore, option B best reflects the passage's explanation of how feral behavior develops."

The passage clearly states that the described farming focuses on producing food *only* for the farmer's family and doesn't go to market for profit ( ""...oomishamee nyaata qonnaan bultootaafi maatii isaani qofaaf oolu, kan gabaaf hin oolle"").  

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with the passage:

*   **A: Omisha fedhii maatii qotee bulaa guutu irratti xiyyeeffachuu** – This aligns with the idea of growing what the family needs.
*   **C: Faallaa maloota ammayyaa omisha baay’ee irratti xiyyeeffachuu** – The passage mentions increasing yield using simple methods.
*   **D: Sanyiin naannoo qotee bulaarraa akka ta’u gochuu** –  This refers to utilizing local seeds and traditional farming practices.

Option B directly contradicts the passage's core principle of self-sufficiency and *not* selling to others."
Shaakalawwan armaan gadii keessa qonna jireenya maatii qofaaf ta’u (subsistence agriculture) sirriitti kan ibsu kami?,"Correct answer: **C: Qotee bultoonni omisha isaanii naannoo isaanitti akka qoodan hayyama**

Here's why:

* **Subsistence agriculture** is defined as farming primarily for the farmer's family and local community, with little or no surplus for sale. The passage states the product ""is for the food of farmers and their families only, and is not for sale.""
* Option C directly reflects this idea – the farmers distribute their produce within their immediate area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Guutummaatti mala orgaanikiiti (Completely organic methods):** While subsistence farming *often* uses organic methods, it’s not a defining characteristic.  You can have subsistence farming that uses some conventional methods.
* **B: Callaa guddisuuf maloota addaa fayyadama (Using special methods to increase yield):** Increasing yield isn't the *purpose* of subsistence farming. It's about producing enough for survival, not maximizing profit.
* **D: Ammayyuu qotee bultoota biyyoota tokko tokko keessa jiraniin fayidaarra oolaa jira (Still benefiting farmers in some countries):** This is a true statement (as the text mentions), but it doesn't define what subsistence farming *is*.

Godambaa daawwachuu gosa turizimii kam jalatti ramadama?,"The correct answer is **B: Turizimii bashannanaa**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Qarqarri galaanootaa, paarkiiwwan bashannanaa fi bakkeewwan qubataa kanneen yeroo hedduu bakkeewwan hunda caalaa tuuristoonni bashannanan itti baay’atanidha."" (Resorts, amusement parks and recreation areas are often the most visited places by tourists).  This directly links recreational activities and places to *turizimii bashannanaa* (recreational tourism).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Turizimii biizinasii** (Business tourism) - This refers to travel for work purposes, which the text contrasts with leisure travel.
*   **C: Turizimii aadaa** (Cultural tourism) - The text defines this as travel to learn about a place's history and culture, not simply for recreation.
*   **D: Turizimii bakkee** (Eco-tourism) - This wasn't mentioned in the text.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, namoota bashannana deemaniif maaltu akka dursaatti fudhatama?","The correct answer is **D: Seenaa bakka sanaa hubachuu** (Understanding the history of the place).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kaayyoon bakka tokko daawwachuu nama tokkoo seenaa fi aadaa isaa baruuf yoo ta’e gosti turiizimiin akkasii tuuriizimii aadawaa jedhama."" (If the purpose of someone visiting a place is to learn its history and culture, that type of tourism is called cultural tourism.)

The question asks what is prioritized for people who travel for leisure.  Cultural tourism (learning the history) is presented as a key aspect of this type of travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aadaa naannoo irratti xiyyeeffachuu** (Focusing on the culture of the area) - While related, history is a more fundamental aspect of understanding a place.
*   **B: Hojii isaanii guyyuu irraa boqachuu** (Getting away from their daily work) - This describes *why* people travel for leisure, not *what* they prioritize *during* the travel.
*   **C: Bakkeewwan mimmiidhagoo ilaaluu** (Looking at beautiful places) - This refers to recreational tourism (like resorts and parks) mentioned earlier in the text, which is different from cultural tourism.

Waldaa naannoo keessatti sodaa jijjiiramaa hir’isuuf waanta gargaare kan kuticha keessatti eerame maalidha?,"The correct answer is **A: Yeroo amala intarpiriinuraalii (entrepreneurial behavior) milk’aa ta’e yaadachuu** (Remembering times of successful entrepreneurial behavior).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Fakkeenya kana keessatti, fakkeenya amala hojii uumummaa duraa yaadachuunii fi milkaa’ina mirkaneessuun namoonni carraa haaraa akka banan akkasumas mana amantaa kiiristaanaa naannawaatiif kallattii haaraa ta’e gargaara."" This directly translates to: ""In this example, remembering instances of past entrepreneurial behavior and confirming successes helps people open up new opportunities and creates a new path for the nearby Christian church.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Namoota aadaa dhaabbatichaa irratti dhiibbaa fidan irraa hubannoo argachuu** (Gaining understanding from people who impacted the organization's culture) - While the passage mentions learning from those who influenced the organization, it doesn't explicitly state this *reduces* resistance to change.
* **C: Waantoota dhaabbaticha gaggeessan bira gahuu** (Becoming aware of what the organization has accomplished) - The passage mentions achievements, but it doesn't link them to reducing resistance.
* **D: Seenaa dhaabbatichaa hubachuu** (Understanding the history of the organization) - Understanding history is helpful, but the passage specifically highlights the *impact* of remembering successful entrepreneurial spirit as the key to opening up new paths.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, seenaa nama tokkoo hubannoo argachuun maalif nama garagaara?","Correct answer: **A: Sodaa jijjiiramaa hir’isuu**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Seenaawwan milkaa’inaa akkanaai sodaa jijjiiramaa xiqqeessu, osooma ilaalcha namoonni gara fuulduraatti jijjiramaaf qabaatan gaarii uumaa."" (These stories of success lessen the fear of change and create a good attitude towards the changes people have towards the future.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Duudhaalee guddisuu:** While understanding history can broaden perspectives, the passage doesn't focus on expanding skills.
* **C: Dhaabbaticha keessatti iddoo ofii kennuu:** The passage mentions finding one's place *within* the organization's history, but doesn't say understanding a person's story *gives* you a place.
* **D: Amala intarpiriinuraalii fooyyessuu:** The passage doesn't discuss interpersonal traits or fixing them.

Himoota armaan gadii keessaa barachuudhaf mala postmodarnii sirrii kan ibsu kami?,"Correct answer is **D: Barachuu keessatti kuni mudaa hin qabu kan jedhamu hin jiru**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage argues against the idea of objective, ""good"" learning.** It states ""Dhugaa dubbachuuf, wanti gaariin baratamu tokko illee hinjiru."" (To speak truthfully, there is nothing good to learn). It focuses on the gap between experience and knowledge, and how much of our ""learning"" comes from passive observation (like television) that we don't actively engage with or apply.
*   **Postmodern thought often rejects the notion of universal truths or objective knowledge.** It suggests that knowledge is constructed and subjective. Saying there is *no* inherently valuable learning aligns with this postmodern idea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shaakalliwwan barachuu tokko tokko kaan irra fayidaa qabeessadha (Some learning methods are more beneficial than others).** The passage doesn't support this. It implies that the *value* of learning is questionable overall.
*   **B: Barachuun wantoota ni shaakalla jennee amannu irratti xiyyeeffachuu qaba (Learning should focus on what we believe is true).** This is the opposite of the passage's message, which questions the validity of what we believe.
*   **C: Maloonni barachuu tokko tokko kan biraa irra ni caala (Some learning methods are better than others).** Similar to A, the passage doesn't rank learning methods; it casts doubt on learning itself.

"Yeroo sa’aatii hirribaa idileetti beekatuma erga dammaqneen booda, kanneen keessaa adeemsa hirriiba adda kutuu gidduu kan galu (interfere ) kami?","The correct answer is **D: Bidhaan minjaala siree cinaa jiru irraa fudhatanii dhuguuf hirribaa dammaquu**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions that consuming a liquid (like water or tea) before re-entering the sleep cycle is a disruptive behavior that the technique aims to counter. It states that this forces the person to wake up and become fully alert, defeating the purpose of the technique.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Osoo deebi’anii hin rafin dura sa’aatii tokkoof walakkaaf dubbisuu** (Reading for half an hour before re-entering sleep) - While not ideal, this isn’t directly mentioned as a disruption in the passage.
* **B: Mana fincaanii dhaqanii deebi’anii rafuu** (Going to the bathroom and re-entering sleep) - This is a natural need and doesn’t inherently interfere with the process.
* **C: Alaarmii minjaala siree cinaarra jiru cufuun daqiiqaa digdama booda deebi’anii rafuu** (Turning off a nearby alarm and re-entering sleep after a few minutes) - This seems to align with the technique of a short wake-up period.



Therefore, only option D directly describes a behavior the passage identifies as counterproductive to the described technique."
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa hirriba addaan kutuu kan sirriitti hin ibsine kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Sa’aatii uumamaan nu keessa (biorhythm) jirurratti hundaa’uu danda’a**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a method to *force* wakefulness after a nap, using a timed alarm and potentially a stimulating drink. It focuses on manipulating the sleep/wake cycle with external factors (alarm, caffeine).  It doesn't mention anything about aligning with natural biorhythms.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

*   **B: Kaayyonsaa akka ati guutummaatti of-hin dammaksineedha** - The passage explicitly says the goal is to wake you *before* you reach deep sleep (""Osoo raftuu sa’ati irra deebite guutte argamte,kutaa isa gara achi aanutti dabarfama"").
*   **C: Adeemsichi kan raawwatu yeroo sa’aatii hirribaa kee idileetti** - The passage states it happens during a planned nap (""Jeeqamuun hirribaa adeemsa itti yaaduudhaan yeroo hirribaakee baratamaa keessa dammaqxuu"").
*   **D: Dammaquu booda, kaayyonsaa sa’aatii lama keessatti deebi’anii rafuudha** - The passage states it's about waking up within 10-60 minutes (""daqiiqa 10-60"").  Two hours isn't mentioned.



"
Sammuun yommuu irra deddeebin abjuu abjootu maaltu dabala?,"Correct answer: **D: Yeroo sadarkaa hirribaa abjuun itti uumamu gidduu jiru**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states the problem is caused by *expanding the time spent in REM sleep*. The feeling of being unrested comes from the brain trying to fully recharge during the extended REM periods.  Therefore, the effect on the brain is related to the duration *within* the REM sleep stage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hanga sadarkaa hirribaa abjuu itti uumamu (REM)** -  It's not just *reaching* REM sleep, but the *length* of time spent in it.
*   **B: Sadarkaa anniisaa** - The text doesn't mention light sleep stages.
*   **C: Turtii sadarkaa dammaquu ykn bayyanachuu** - This refers to the stages of falling asleep, not the problem described.

Miidhawwan negatiiva armaan gadii keessaa rafanii osoo ofirraa hin bu’in abjoochuun (lucid dreaming) qaama irratti qabu kami?,"Correct answer: **A: Dheerinni sa’aatii sadarkaa hirribaa abjuun itti uumamu gidduu jiru hir’achuu**

Here's why:

The passage explains that some people find prolonged exposure to blue light exhausting because it extends the amount of time spent in REM sleep. It compares this to feeling tired after watching TV for hours.  Therefore, the negative consequence of prolonged lucid dreaming is an *increase* in the amount of time spent in deep sleep (which is akin to REM sleep), leading to exhaustion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Halkanitti sadarkaan hirribaa abjuun itti uumamu hir’achuu** - The passage doesn't mention a decrease in the *quality* of sleep, but rather an *increase* in the *duration* of a specific sleep stage.
* **C: Rafanii osoo ofirraa hin bu’in abjoochuu irratti hirkachuu** - The passage isn't about the difficulty of lucid dreaming itself.
* **D: Halkan halkaniin sadarkaan hirribaa abjuun itti uumamu dabaluu** - The passage describes an *increase*, not a decrease, in the duration of deep sleep.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, gareen qaaman wal arguufi gareen karaa marsaa inatneetii wal argu akkamitti wal-fakkaatu?","The correct answer is **C: Gareen lachuu garee bulchiinsaa hin mul’annetti gabaasu.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the ""unseen group"" (Gartuun hin argamne).** This group is described as something all members contribute to and receive from, but it doesn't have a visible, centralized leadership or structure (a ""conventional"" governing group).  The passage highlights how virtual teams operate differently from physical teams, lacking the immediate physical presence and clear hierarchy.
* **Option C reflects this key concept.** The idea of broadcasting to a team without a visible governing group aligns perfectly with the description of the ""unseen group.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gareeewwan lachuu sadarkaa tokkoon akka hojjatantu irraa eegama (Teams work at the same level):** The passage doesn't suggest all members operate at the same level.  It implies differences in autonomy and function.
* **B: Gareen lachuu hojiisaanii guyyuu keessatti sadarkaa aangoo garaa garaa qabu (Teams have different levels of authority in their daily work):** While possible, the passage's main point isn't about hierarchies *within* the team, but about the *absence* of a visible overarching structure.
* **D: Gareen lachuu zoonii sa’aatii wal-fakkaatatti hojjatu (Teams work in the same time zone):** The passage specifically mentions that virtual teams can work at different times, even interacting with a physical presence that isn't synchronous.

Here's why:

* **Content theories of motivation** (like Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory, mentioned in the passage) focus on *what* motivates people – the needs, desires, and drives *within* the individual. They try to identify the internal factors that spur action.
* Option B, focusing on how the environment influences behavior, is a key aspect of **process theories of motivation**. Process theories (like Expectancy Theory, Goal-Setting Theory, Equity Theory) explore *how* motivation occurs – the cognitive processes people use to make choices about what actions to take. They look at how the *situation* impacts motivation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fedhiiwwan haaraa nama gaheessa irratti mul’atan:** This relates to identifying *what* people want, a core of content theories.
* **C: Fedhii hubatame:**  Understanding underlying needs is central to Maslow and Herzberg.
* **D: Waanta namoonni jaalatan hubachuu:**  This is about identifying desires and preferences, fitting within content theories.

Therefore, the question specifically asks which is *not* a focus of content theories, and the answer is **B**."
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa qaama seera sittii kaasuu (object of the rule of thirds) kan hin taane kami?,"Correct answer: **D: Suura keessatti namuusa bu’uuressuu**

Here's why:

The rule of thirds is a compositional guideline in photography and visual arts. It's about *where* you place elements within a frame to create a more balanced and engaging image. Let's break down why the other options relate to the rule of thirds, and why D doesn't:

*   **A: Suurri eessa akka kaa’amuuf ka’uumsa (baseline) uumuu** - The rule of thirds provides a grid (imaginary lines) that serves as a ""baseline"" for where to position key elements.
*   **B: Suura keessatti humnaafi lubbuu horuu** - Placing elements along the lines or at their intersections is thought to create a more dynamic and visually interesting composition, thus enhancing ""strength and life"" in the image.
*   **C: Suuricha bakka sirriifi murtaa’aa ta’e kaa’uu** - The rule of thirds helps you to strategically place elements to create a balanced and clear focal point.

*   **D: Suura keessatti namuusa bu’uuressuu** -  While a good photograph might *contain* emotion or tell a story (""narrative""), the rule of thirds is a *technical* guideline about *composition*, not about the subject matter's emotional content. It doesn't directly deal with creating narrative or mood.



Therefore, the rule of thirds doesn’t directly focus on bringing out emotion or narrative in the picture, so D is the correct answer."
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa suura abbaa foormaatii 35mm kan hin ibsine kami?,"Correct answer is **A: Ammayyuu hojjatamaa jira**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on describing the *characteristics* of the 35mm format – its size, aspect ratio, and how it relates to digital formats. It states that while 35mm film is older, it still influences modern digital cameras.  Saying it's ""still in use"" (Ammayyuu hojjatamaa jira) doesn't describe a *characteristic* of the 35mm format itself; it just states its current status.

Let's look at why the other options *are* characteristics described in the passage:

*   **B: Formaatii kaameeraa dijitaalan fudhatame** - The text explicitly says digital cameras have adopted the 35mm format's aspect ratio.
*   **C: Formaatiwwan beekamoon irraa addatti reeshoo addaa qaba** - The passage highlights the 3:2 aspect ratio, distinguishing it from other formats like APS.
*   **D: Addunyaarratti formaatii beekamaadha** - The passage starts by stating 35mm is a well-known format globally.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, warshaalen yommuu qulqullina omisha leenisiwwanii dabalaa deeman, leensiwwan guddistuun (zoom lenses) hangam fooyya’an?","Correct answer: **D: Leensiwwan ijoo (prime lenses) caala kompileeksiitii leensii xiqqaa qabu**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that zoom lenses (leensota guddisoo) require more complex elements to achieve high focal lengths and image quality compared to prime lenses (leensota piraayimii). This complexity is the main reason for the challenges mentioned in the passage regarding zoom lens production. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Saffisa leensiwwanii guddaa qabu** - While zoom lenses *have* a large aperture, the passage doesn't focus on aperture size as the primary issue.
*   **B: Ifti xiqqaan yeroo jirutti itti fayyadamuuf salphaadha** - The passage mentions that zoom lenses can be difficult to use in low-light conditions *because* of their complexity, not that they are easy to use.
*   **C: Qulqullinni suura isaanii leensiwwan dheerina qiyyaafannoo fiksidii (fixed focal length) wajjin wal-fakkaata** - The passage implies that achieving the *same* image quality is more difficult with zoom lenses, not that it's equal.



"
"Odeeffannoo kuticha keessa jiru irratti hundaa’un, leensiwwan guddistuun leenjiiwwan ijoo caalaa yoom filatamu?","Correct answer: **A: Qaawwan (aperture) guddaan xiyyeeffannoo yoo ta’e**

Here's why:

The text states that larger lenses are preferred when seeking a strong ""depth of field"" (xiyyeeffannoo dheerinni isaa murtaa’e) and when wanting to capture many elements in focus. This is directly related to the lens's aperture. A larger aperture (smaller f-number) allows for a shallower depth of field, whereas a smaller aperture (larger f-number) creates a larger depth of field. The text implies that larger lenses help achieve this deeper focus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Qabiyeewwan leensii xiqqaa yoo barbaadde:** The text doesn't mention a preference for small lens coatings.
*   **C: Bakka (settings) dukkana keessatti ifa fayyadamuu hin barbaaddu yoo ta’e:** While aperture does affect exposure, the text doesn't state that larger lenses are specifically chosen for low-light situations where less brightness is desired.
*   **D: Kompileeksiitii fookaali caalu ilaalta yoo ta’e:** While focal length is mentioned, the primary reason for choosing larger lenses isn't a preference for complex focal lengths, but for greater depth of field.

Here's why:

The text defines Mysticism as a direct, personal experience and union with the divine, emphasizing inner knowing and states of bliss, fulfillment, or certainty. It's about *internal* realization.

*   **A, C, and D** all align with this definition:
    *   **A: Dhugaa Waaqayyoo hubachuu barbaaduu** (Desiring to know the truth of God) - Directly relates to seeking divine understanding.
    *   **C: Gammachuu sammuurratti xiyyeeffachuu** (Focusing on inner joy/bliss) -  Mysticism often involves experiencing states of profound happiness.
    *   **D: Waa’ee Waaqayyoo hubachuuf dhama’uu** (Striving to understand God) - The core of mystical pursuit is understanding the divine.

*   **B: Haraa shaakala waan hawaasarraa argamuun beekumsa ykn hubannaa argachuuf dhama’uu** (Striving to gain knowledge or understanding through external or material things) - This describes a path to knowledge that is *external* and relies on sensory experience or external sources, which is the *opposite* of the internal, experiential focus of Mysticism. It's closer to empirical investigation or philosophical inquiry rather than mystical experience.

Therefore, option B is the one that does **not** align with the described focus of Mysticism."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, hawaasa qotee bulaa eenyutu eegale?","Correct answer is **B: Moriyoorii Odoolawwan Chaatam irraa**

The passage states: ""Maariyooriin garee Maaworii giddugalaa kan Niiw zeelaand irraa gara oddola Chaataami’tti godaananii aadaa adda nagaan-guutuu kan mataasaanii uummataniidha."" This means the Moriori originated from a group of Maori who migrated to the Chatham Islands and developed a distinct culture there.  They are the ones who started the distinct, isolated culture described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Moriyoorii Niwu Ziiland irraa** - The passage states they *migrated from* New Zealand, they didn't start their distinct culture *in* New Zealand.
*   **C: Uummata Mawoorii Poolineeshiyaa irraa** - The passage suggests a later origin for Maori from Polynesia, but the Moriori specifically developed as a separate group *after* leaving New Zealand.
*   **D: Mawoorii biyya haadhoo irraa** - This is not mentioned in the passage."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, gareen Maa’os adamse jiraattota jalqabaa bakka kamiiti?","Correct answer: **C: Odoolawwan Chaatam**

(According to new evidence, the Moriori were a group of Maori from New Zealand who migrated to the Chatham Islands and developed their own distinct culture).

Therefore, the Moriori, who are described as the first inhabitants, originally came from New Zealand but settled on the Chatham Islands."

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...dachaasuu tokko qofaan hojjetamuu danda'amu waliin, dadacha'insi walxaxaan kan akka duubatti dachaasuu kan hin hayyamamnee, fi dadacha'insi hundi bakkeewwan salphaa qabanidha."" This translates to: ""...can be folded in a single attempt, without the difficulty of complex folds like a valley fold, and all folds are easy to make.""  This directly implies the folder is designed to handle *many* folds easily.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Fooldarichi dandeettii sochii qaamaa ammayyaa qaba** (The folder has limited body movement capability) - The passage doesn’t mention any limitation in body movement. It focuses on the *folding* capabilities.
* **C: Fooldarichi origami duubatti dachaasuu gaafatu uumaa jira** (The folder creates a need for valley folds in origami) - The passage specifically says it *avoids* the difficulty of valley folds.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Oorigamiin Piyuurlaandi is *for those with no experience* or *limited motor skills*.  This directly contradicts option A, which suggests it's for those *with* experience.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

*   **B: Malichi fooldiwwan duubatti deebisuu hin hammatu (It does not involve complex folds that return to the back)** - The passage says it lacks complex folds like those at the back.
*   **C: Fooldiwwan teessuma fuulduratti qajeela (straightforward locations) qabaachuu qabu (Folds must be in simple locations)** - The passage states all folds have simple locations.
*   **D: Fooldariiwwan sochii qaamaa xiqqaa (imited motor skills) qabaniif mala gaaridha (It's a good method for those with limited motor skills)** - The passage directly says it helps people with limited motor skills.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, bakki qaroomina sulala Induus (Indus Valley) wajjin walitti hin dhufne kami?","Correct answer is **C: Naannolee kaaba baha Afgaanistaanitti argaman hunda**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Indus Valley Civilization (also referred to as the Indus-Sarasvati Civilization) extended *into* and included areas of Afghanistan, *alongside* the Sarasvati river. However, it doesn't say the entire region of eastern Afghanistan was *within* the civilization.  It specifically mentions areas *dabalatee* (including) the Kabul River area, but not *all* areas of eastern Afghanistan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Harappaa** - Harappa is a key site *within* the Indus Valley Civilization, and is mentioned as a name previously used for the civilization.
*   **B: Laga Saraasvaati** - The Sarasvati river is explicitly stated as potentially being a part of the civilization's area.
*   **D: Paakisataan ammaa harka heddu** - The Indus Valley Civilization flourished in what is now Pakistan, as indicated by the mention of the Indus River and its surrounding areas.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa maqaa Qaroomina Bara Biroonzii kuticha keessatti irratti mariyatemee kan hin taane kami?,"Correct answer is **A: Qaroomina Haraappiyaan**.

Here's why:

The passage mentions ""Qaroomina Harapaan"" as a name sometimes used for the same civilization, *after* the name ""Qaroomina Indus-Saraasvati"" was used. It is also mentioned that the civilization was first identified from Harappa.  However, ""Qaroomina Haraappiyaan"" isn't specifically presented as a name *being discussed* or debated *within* the text as the others are.

The passage specifically highlights these names:

*   **Qaroomina Sulula Indus** (Indus Civilization) - The primary name discussed
*   **Qaroomina Indus-Saraasvati** (Indus-Sarasvati Civilization) - A proposed alternative name based on the Sarasvati river.
*   **Qaroomina Sarasvati** (Sarasvati Civilization) - Mentioned as part of the discussion about the Indus-Sarasvati name.

Therefore, Qaroomina Haraappiyaan is the only option that doesn't fit the context of names actively being considered or debated in the passage."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa fayidaa yeroo dheeraa kan kennu kami?","The correct answer is **A: Kanneen biroo wajjin wal-ta’uu (Collaborating with others)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that Kajeellaaniifi is successful because they consistently get a bigger slice of the pie when others are getting good results. This implies they benefit from the success of those around them.  The passage also states that people realize they are better off working with those who are overall better than them.

*   **Collaborating (A)** directly aligns with this idea – working *with* others, especially those who are high performers, leads to long-term benefits as you share in their success.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Fedhii nama tokkoof dursa kennuu (Prioritizing someone’s desires)** - While helpful in some situations, this doesn’t necessarily guarantee long-term gains, especially in a competitive environment.
*   **C: Garee guddaarra waan garee xiqqaa fayyadurratti xiyyeeffachuu (Focusing on improving small things within a larger group)** -  This is good for incremental improvement, but doesn’t explain the core concept of benefiting from the overall success of others.
*   **D: Albaadhessa ta’uu hubachuun fayidaa qabachuu danda’a (Understanding and exploiting advantages can be beneficial)** - This has a negative connotation and isn't the core message of the passage.  The passage implies a more cooperative rather than exploitative approach.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, xiyyeeffannoon isaanii fayidaa ammee irratti yoo ta’e kanneen armaan gadii keessaa namni tokko kamiif dursa kennuu danda’a?","The correct answer is **A: Ofittoo ta’uu dhiisuu** (Rejecting opportunism).

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where someone benefits from taking advantage of opportunities (""Ofittoo ta'uudhaan"") when others are successful. It then states a hope that people will choose long-term collaboration with others over this short-term gain.  

Therefore, the way to counteract this is to *reject* opportunism – to not consistently seek immediate advantages at the expense of long-term relationships and collaboration.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Wal-ta’iinsa** (Competition) - Competition isn't the solution; the passage speaks to avoiding exploitation *within* a successful context.
* **C: Wal-gargaarsa** (Mutual Help) - While good, it doesn't directly address the problematic behavior of opportunism described in the passage.  It's a consequence of rejecting opportunism, not the act itself.
* **D: Alboodhomuu dhiisuu** (Rejecting laziness) - This is unrelated to the core message of the passage.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, baasii waraanichaa harka caalu kan danda’e eenyudha?","The correct answer is **C: Mootummaa garboomfataa U.S**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Filipinos were compelled to pay heavy taxes to the U.S. colonial government, and that this was done through a system facilitated by Wall Street banks.  The *benefit* of this system (the significant financial gain) went to U.S. imperialism. Therefore, the U.S. colonial government ultimately profited the most.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mootummaa Filiippins:** The passage states the Filipino government was *forced* to collect taxes *for* the U.S., meaning they didn't benefit.
*   **B: Baankiwwan Wool Istiriit:** While Wall Street banks facilitated the process, they were intermediaries. The passage highlights the larger benefit going to U.S. imperialism.
*   **D: Uummata Filippiins:** The Filipinos experienced a *burden* of heavy taxes, not a benefit.

Bara Teempilars dura kan dhufu bara kamiidha?,"The correct answer is **C: Jalqaba Bara Giddu Galeessaa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Umriin itti taateewwan ta’an yeroo hunda Bara Jiddugaleesa Guddaa jedhamu yeroo seenaa Awurooppaa jaarraa 11ffaa, 12ffaa, fi 13ffaa (AD 1000–1300) keessa."" and ""Baroonni Giddu-galaa Olaanoon kan durfamu Baroota Giddugalaa Duraa fi kan itti aanamu Baroota Giddugalaa Boodaa isa koonveenshiniin naannoo bara 1500 dhumeenidha.""

This indicates the Templars existed *during* the High Middle Ages, which encompasses the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries. The period *before* that would be the Early Middle Ages (Jalqaba Bara Giddu Galeessaa). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bara Giddu Galeessaa Gara Booddee** – The Templars existed *within* the High Middle Ages, not before it.
*   **B: Jaarraa 12ffaa** – The 12th century is *part of* the period the Templars existed in, not before it.
*   **D: Jaarraa 13ffaa** – Similar to the 12th century, the 13th century is *part of* the period, not before.



"
Bara Teempilars booda kan dhufu bara kamiidha?,"The correct answer is **A: Bara Giddu Galeessaa Gara Booddee** (Late Middle Ages).

Here's why:

The passage states that the Middle Ages are divided into Early, High, and Late periods. It specifically says the High Middle Ages (the time of the Templars) *leads into* the Late Middle Ages, ending around 1500. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jaarraa 12ffaa** (12th Century) - This is *within* the High Middle Ages, not after it.
* **C: Bara Giddu Galeessaa Olaanaa** (High Middle Ages) - This is the period the Templars *were in*, not what came after.
* **D: Jaarraa 11ffaa** (11th Century) - This is also *within* the High Middle Ages.

Waldhaansi ykn adeemsi waldhaansa meedikaalaa ogeeyyiin baqaqsanii yaaluu bara Empaayera Roomaa itti dhimma itti bahaa turan keessatti kan hin eeramne kami?,"Correct answer is **A: Dhiphina sammuu miidhama booda dhufu qorichoota raffisan garaa garaan waldhaanuu**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage details** the Romans using morphine from poppies, scopolamine from henbane, tourniquets, and even amputation for gangrene. These are all mentioned as practices they employed.
*   **However, the passage makes no mention** of treating post-surgical mental health issues (like depression or PTSD) or using different forms of therapy to cope with trauma, which is what option A refers to. This kind of psychological care was not a focus of Roman medical practice as described in the text.

Therefore, option A is the only practice *not* indicated as something Roman physicians were concerned with."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa milkaa’ina damee waldhaansaa ykn meedikaalaa bara Empaayera Roomaa keessatti mul’ate kan hin ilaallanne kami?","Correct answer: **C: Hospitaalonni itti baratan hundaa’uu**

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses:**
    * **A: Gareen Ogeeyyii fayyaa hundaa’uu:**  The text explicitly states Emperor Augustus started choosing physicians and founded Roman Medical Corps.
    * **B: Dambii waraanaa cimaa Empaayerichaa:** The passage begins by stating the importance of healthcare to the Roman army's success.
    * **D: Empeerarichi doktoroota qacaruu:** The passage says Augustus chose physicians.

* **The passage does *not* discuss:**  While medical knowledge advanced, the text doesn't mention the establishment of formal, educational hospitals as we understand them today. The medical practices described were more about immediate battlefield care and utilizing available resources (poppy, morphine, tourniquets, etc.).  



Therefore, the development of training hospitals is the one option not linked to the advancements described in the passage."
Dandeettin arguu maalirratti hundaa’a?,"The correct answer is **A: Orgaanota seensarii mala agartuu** (Sensory organs of the body).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Agartuu, ykn dandeettiin waa arguu qaamota miiraa sirna agartuu ykn ijaa irratti hundaa’a."" This directly translates to ""Perception, or the ability to sense things, is based on the normal sensory organs of the body or the eye.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ulaagaalee organizimii** (Organizational structures) - While the passage mentions organization, it doesn't say perception is *based* on organizational structures.
* **C: Sensitiviitii dheerina danbalii tokko tokkoof** (Sensitivity to specific wavelengths) - This is a *part* of how the eye works, but not the fundamental basis of perception itself.
* **D: Garaa garummaa sadarkaa cimina dhibee** (Differences in the severity of illness) - This is unrelated to the topic of perception.



"
Garaagarummaan caasan ijaa orgaanizimoota gidduutti argamu maal irratti hundaa’a?,"The correct answer is **B: Ulaagaalee organizimichaa** (Characteristics of the organism).

This directly translates to ""Different organs have different abilities, **different wavelength sensitivities, different levels of complexity**, and also require different processes to function properly and different numbers of components.""  These are all *characteristics* of the organism and dictate how its organs differ.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sensitiviitii dheerina dambalii** (Wavelength sensitivity) - While mentioned, it's *one* characteristic, not the overall reason for variation.
*   **C: Sadarkaa cimina dhibee** (Level of disease resistance) - This isn't discussed in the passage.
*   **D: Wal-xaxaa ta’uu orgaanizimichaa** (The organism's sociality) -  This is also not mentioned and irrelevant to organ differences.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, Sikizimii ilaalchisee hima kamtu amanticha sirriitti hin ibsu?","Correct answer is **A: Sikizimiin Hinduu keessatti qoodamiinsa uumameen kan dhufeedha**.

Here's why:

The passage states Sikhiism arose *within* Hinduism due to disagreement and a desire to differentiate, but it **doesn't** say it was a direct split or division *from* Hinduism. It emphasizes that Sikhs see themselves as distinct *from* Hinduism, even while acknowledging shared roots and cultural elements.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

*   **B: Guurun ijoo Sikizimii isa bu’uurati:** The text clearly states ""Guuruun amantaa Indiyaanotaa hundaaf wanta bu’uura ta’ee dha garuu Sikhisimii keessatti barbaachisummaa keessoo amantaa sikhii kan uume qabate.""
*   **C: Guuruu Nanak erga amanticha hundeessee booda guuruwwan sagal duuka bu’an:** The passage says, ""Amantichi jaarraa 15ffaa (1469-1539) keessa Guuruu Naanaakiin hundeeffame. Sana booda guurota sagaltu walduraa-duubaan isa hordofe.""
*   **D: Aadawwan Siikizimii tokko tokko Hidu’izimii keessa kan jiraniidha:** The text implies this by saying Sikhs believe their religion is distinct from Hinduism, but also acknowledge its origins and shared culture with Hinduism.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa hundee amantii Siikizimiiti jedhamee kan fudhatamu kami?","Correct answer: **A: Yaad-rimee guurichaa**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Amantichi jaarraa 15ffaa (1469-1539) keessa Guuruu Naanaakiin hundeeffame."" This directly indicates that the teachings/philosophy of Guru Nanak are considered the foundation of Sikhism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Aadawwan Hinduu:** While Sikhism originated within a Hindu context and shares some cultural similarities, it's distinct from Hindu traditions. The text points out Sikhs see themselves as different.
*   **C: Amantiiwwan Indiyaa kaan fudhachuu diduu:** The text doesn’t suggest Sikhism was founded on rejecting all other Indian religions.
*   **D: Afaan Punjaabii dubbachuu:** While the term ""Gurmat"" comes from Punjabi, speaking the language isn't the foundation of the religion itself."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, ijoolllen waan tokkorratti xiyyeeffachuu hin dandeenye (Attention Deficit Disorder) yeroo baay’ee maal irratti xiyyeeffachuuf rakkatan maalidha?","The correct answer is **A: Hojii mana baruumsaa** (Schoolwork).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ijoolleen barnoota DABALATAA fudhatan wantoota akka hojii mana barnootafa irratti xiyyeeffachuun itti cima, garuu wantoota hojjechuu jaallatan kanneen akka taphoota taphachuu yookiin ashangulliitii jaallatan do’achuu yookiin sirna tuqaalee malee himoota barreessuu irratti xiyyeeffachuu danda’u."" 

This translates to: ""Children with learning disabilities find it difficult to focus on things like schoolwork, but can focus on things they enjoy doing, such as playing games or preferring to write stories instead of following the established system of answering questions.""

The passage directly contrasts the difficulty these children have with schoolwork versus their ability to focus on preferred activities. Therefore, schoolwork is what they struggle to focus on."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, ijoolllen waan tokkorratti xiyyeeffachuu hin dandeenye amaloota balaarra nama buusan maalif qabaatu?","The correct answer is **A: Waan tokkorratti xiyyeeffachuu dadhabuu hir’isuuf**.

Here's why:

The passage directly states that children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) struggle to focus (""wantoota akka hojii mana barnootafa irratti xiyyeeffachuun itti cima, garuu wantoota hojjechuu jaallatan kanneen akka taphoota taphachuu...irratti xiyyeeffachuu danda’u""). This lack of focus leads them to engage in risky behaviors (""amaloota balaa qabanitti qabamu, lolatti seenu""). The passage links the inability to focus *to* those negative behaviors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hiriyoota wajjin akka wal-qunnaman gargaaruf:** While social difficulties are mentioned as a *result* of the attention issues, it's not the *reason* they engage in risky behaviors.
*   **C: Maatii isaanirraa xiyyeeffannoo argachuuf:** The passage doesn't suggest a link between seeking parental attention and risky behavior.
*   **D: Sammuu isaanii dammaqsuuf:** The risky behaviors are presented as a consequence of an inability to focus and understand social cues, not as a deliberate attempt to stimulate their minds.

"Odeeffannoo kuticha keessa jirurratti hundaa’un, kanneen keessaa fakeenya iskaafholding kan hin taane kami?","Correct answer: **D: Leenjisaa liigii xiqqaa**

Here's why:

The passage discusses scaffolding as a learning tool – a support system that helps learners tackle new and challenging tasks (like new computer programs or projects). It emphasizes that scaffolding is about *providing assistance and guidance* during the learning *process*.

Let's look at why the other options *are* examples of scaffolding:

*   **A: Geemii kompitaraa gara jalqabaatti tutooriyaaluu jiru** - A tutorial in a video game provides step-by-step guidance to help a player learn how to play.
*   **B: Tutorii SAT** - SAT tutoring helps students prepare for a challenging standardized test by breaking down concepts and providing practice.
*   **C: Sagantaa qo’annaa ykn barnootaa of-danda’e** - A self-directed learning plan still requires structure and resources to guide the learner.

**D: Leenjisaa liigii xiqqaa** - A small league coach *isn’t* necessarily about providing temporary support and guidance through a learning *process*. It’s about coaching the players in their skill in the game, but doesn’t directly relate to *learning how to learn* or tackling a new challenge with support. It is a sporting instruction but not scaffolding.

Here's why:

The passage states that scaffolding *within* software (virtual scaffolding) is particularly helpful for learners to independently complete tasks. It *doesn't* mention scaffolding being used in the initial stages of learning or as a general support system in the broader learning *shape*.  It focuses on its role in helping students navigate complex tasks *after* some foundational understanding is present.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Iskaafholdingiin varchuwaalidhaan jiraachuu danda’a** - The text explicitly mentions ""Iskaafoldootni virchuwaali keessa seenaniiru softwericha keessa..."" (Scaffolding can exist virtually within software.)
*   **B: Mala barnootaa irra caalmatti akka tumsaati** - The passage says ""Barnootni piroojektii irratti hunda’uun kennamuu akkuma barnoota salphiisuu fi hawataa taasisuu, malli moojulaawaan ammoo gulantadhaan caalaa ol ka’a."" (Project-based learning with scaffolding is more effective than modular learning alone) indicating it goes beyond a simple learning method.
*   **C: Barnoota pirojektii irratti hundaa’e jedhamuunis beekama** - The passage directly references ""Barnootni piroojektii irratti hunda’e"" (Project-based learning) and its connection to scaffolding.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, fiicharii MySpace kamtu barattoota dubbisuuf rakkatan gargaara?","The correct answer is **A: Kastamaayizeshinii** (Customization).

Here's why:

The passage states that MySpace allows users to adjust the text size (halluu baay’ees ta’e xiqqoodhaan, akkuma barbaachisummaa isaatti fooyyessuun ni danda’ama) to make reading easier. This ability to customize the display is the feature that directly helps students who struggle with reading.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Biloogiwwan** (Blogs) - While MySpace has blogs, this isn't the feature specifically mentioned as helping with reading difficulties.
* **C: Teessiii weebii tokkoo** (A website design) -  This is too broad. The *specific* adjustment of text size is the key.
* **D: Pirofaayiloota miliyoona 54** (54 million profiles) - The number of profiles is irrelevant to helping students read.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa qaama deebii Kiruushcheev hokkara hojjattootaf deebise kan hin taane kami?","The correct answer is **C: Mindaa hir’isuu dabaluu (Increasing repression)**.

Here's why:

The passage states Kirushchev sent tanks and installed Władysław Gomułka as the new Prime Minister. These actions were taken to *restore order* (tasgabbii iddootti deebisuuf) and appease a specific economic interest.  They didn't aim to *increase* repression, but rather to control the situation and install a leader who would be more amenable to Soviet interests. The other options are directly mentioned as things Kirushchev did:

* **A: Muummicha ministeeraa haaraa muuda (Installing a new Prime Minister)** - Directly stated in the text (""akka muudu waliif-gale"").
* **B: Seera kabachiisu taankii fayyadama (Using tanks to enforce order)** -  Also directly stated (""Kirusheev taankii ergellee"").
* **D: Gaaffilee diingadee muraasa simachuu (Satisfying a few economic interests)** - The passage mentions this was the purpose behind his actions (""dantaa dinagdee muraasaaf"").

Therefore, increasing repression wasn’t a component of Kirushchev's response, he was attempting to quell it by changing leadership and asserting force, not intensifying the oppressive measures themselves."
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa Poolanditti sababa hokkaraa kan hin turre kami?,"Correct answer is **D: Muudamuu Wladyslaw Gomulka**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Khrushchev installed Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new prime minister *as a result of* the unrest and to restore stability.  Gomulka's appointment wasn't a cause of the protests, but a *response* to them.

The other options were causes of the unrest:

*   **A: Komunizimii** - The passage mentions the protests ""grew into a protest against Communism.""
*   **B: Hanqinawwan nyaataa** - The passage explicitly states workers protested due to food shortages.
*   **C: Mindaa hir’isuu** - The passage states workers protested against rising prices.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa walitti dhufeenya USSR fu USA kan hin miine kami?","Correct answer is **A: Garaa garummaa aadaa**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states the Cold War (the conflict between the USSR and USA) led to a clash of *systems, processes, and cultures* that brought nations to ruin.  The options B, C, and D all relate to these aspects – differing opinions about Germany (B), conflicting changes (C), and ideological disagreements about systems (D).

However, the text doesn't mention culture/aadaa as a direct cause of the Cold War conflict. While cultural differences *existed*, the passage focuses on political and ideological clashes. Therefore, it is the one that does **not** align with the text's explanation of the USSR-USA conflict.
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessa kaayyoo dhiibbaa narvii (nerve impulses) qaama keessatti erguu sirriitti kan hin ibsine kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Marsaa dhiigaa suuta akka deemu gochuu (Making blood pressure decrease)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states nerve impulses facilitate homeostasis, respond to stimuli, and protect the body from harmful forces.** This implies nerve impulses are involved in *regulating* body functions, not necessarily directly *lowering* blood pressure. While nerve impulses *can* indirectly influence blood pressure (e.g., by signaling for blood vessels to constrict or dilate), it’s not their primary or defining role in the way the passage describes.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: Marsaa dhiigaa to’achuu (Increasing blood pressure):**  Nerve impulses can signal blood vessels to constrict, which *increases* blood pressure, playing a role in maintaining homeostasis.
* **C: Hoomostaasisii tursiisuu (Facilitating homeostasis):** This is *directly* stated in the passage as the primary function.
* **D: Rakkoo qaamaa cimaa ittisuu (Preventing severe physical harm):** The passage mentions protecting the body from ""harmful forces,"" so this aligns with the nerve impulses' protective function.



Therefore, lowering blood pressure is the least directly related to the core functions of nerve impulses as described in the provided text."

Namicha abiddaan mana sagadaa sana balleesse beekuu keenyaf eenyutu itti gaafatama?,"The correct answer is **A: Warra Efesoon**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Warri Efesiyaa, hedduu dheekkamanii, maqaan Herostraatos yoomiyyuu akka hin galmoofne ibsa kennanii jiru."" This translates to ""The Ephesians, suffering greatly, stated that the name of Herostratus should never be mentioned."" This implies they were the ones who knew and spoke about the person who destroyed the temple, and therefore held him accountable (even if just by refusing to name him).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Aleeksaandar Guddicha:** While Alexander offered to rebuild the temple, he wasn't the one who destroyed it.
*   **C: Istiraaboo:** Strabo was a historian who *recorded* the name, but didn't destroy the temple.
*   **D: Arxeemis:** Artemis is the goddess the temple was dedicated to; she didn't destroy it herself.



"
Mana sagadaa Arxeemis deebisanii ijaaruu ilaalchisee himni sirriin kami?,"Correct answer: **B: Aleeksaandar Guddichi erga mo’ee booda ijaarame**

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Booda, erga Alegzaandar du’ee, gamoon waaqeffannaa sun dhaloota Kiristoos dura bara 323 keessa deebi’ee ijaarame."" This directly translates to ""After Alexander died, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BCE.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baasii ijaarsichaa kan kaffale Aleeksaandar Guddicha** - The text says Alexander *offered* to pay for the rebuilding, but his offer was *not accepted*.
*   **C: Baasii ijaarsichaa akka danda’uuf Herostiraatastu ajajame** - The text states that Herostratus *destroyed* the temple, not rebuilt it.
*   **D: Bara 320 BCE tti ijaarame** - The text specifies it was rebuilt in 323 BCE, not 320 BCE."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, uumamni dur durii miila lamaan deemuu kan jalqabe yoomi?","The correct answer is **A: Waggaa miliyoona torbaatama dura**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""seehelaantirooppiis miila lamaan dursanii waggoota miiliyoona torba dura deemuu hin hafani."" This translates to ""Australopithecus likely didn't start walking on two legs before seven million years ago."" Therefore, the earliest evidence suggests bipedalism (walking on two legs) began around seven million years ago.



"
Sanyiiwwan kanneen keessaa dhaabbataadhan miila lamaan kan deeme kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Sahelantirooppas**.

Here's why:

The text states: "" *...seehelaantirooppiis miila lamaan dursanii waggoota miiliyoona torba dura deemuu hin hafani.*"" (Sahelanthropus walked on two legs possibly seven million years ago). 

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Hoomoo Eraaktas** - The text mentions *Hoomoo Irreektasiin* (Homo erectus) as a later development, not the first to walk upright.
*   **C: Ispeshaalayizeeshinii Baayipeedal** - This is a term for bipedalism (walking on two legs) itself, not a species.
*   **D: Awustiraalopitikas** - The text states *Awustiraalopitikas yeroo hundaa dhaabatanii hin deemne* (Australopithecus did not always walk upright).

Yeroo WWII humni galaanaa Jarman maal galmaan gahuuf yaalaature?,"The correct answer is **B: Biriteen namoota fi meeshaalee akka hin fudhanne ittisuu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yeroo wal-fakkaataatti, waraanni galaanaa Jarman daandii tiraafikaa kana bidiruu-U dhaan dhaabsisuuf yaalaa turan. Gareen wal ta’iinsaa kufuun, akkuma biyyoota awrooppaa biro jarmaniin tarii Biritaaniyaa koloneeffachuu in dandeessi turte.""

This translates to: ""At the same time, the German navy was trying to block this traffic route. By eliminating the alliance, Germany could have colonized Britain like other European countries.""  This indicates they were trying to prevent Britain from receiving supplies (people and materials) from America.



"
"Odeeffannoo kuticha keessatti kenname irratti hundaa’un, yeroo Duula Kaaba Atilaantikii waraana galaanarraatin eenyutu milkaa’ee ture?","The correct answer is **A: Warra Biritiish fi Ameerikaanota** (The British and Americans).

Here's why:

The passage states that the Americans were trying to help the British by sending personnel and supplies across the Atlantic. It also mentions the German navy trying to disrupt this flow. The implication is that the British and Americans *succeeded* in maintaining the supply line, which was crucial. While the passage doesn't explicitly state a ""winner,"" it frames the German attempts as *trying to prevent* the British and Americans from achieving their goal.  Therefore, the British and Americans were the ones who were successful in the Battle of the Atlantic.



"
Warri Asiiriyaanotaa yeroo loltoota fardeeniitti fayyadamuu jalqaban waanti hin turre maali?,"The correct answer is **A: Kooraa fardaa** (Saddles).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kooraan dugda fardaarra ka’amu hin kalaqamne ture, kanaaf loltootni Kavalaryii Assiriyaa qullaa dugda ardoota irra ta’ani lolan."" This translates to: ""Saddles were not yet invented, so Assyrian cavalry soldiers fought standing on the backs of the horses.""

Therefore, the Assyrians *didn't* have saddles when they began using cavalry, making it the correct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Iddaa xiyyi ittiin darbatamu (Weapon to get off the horse):** The passage discusses how they *stood* on the horses, not how they dismounted.
*   **C: Konkolaataa fardaa (Horse carriages):** The passage focuses on cavalry (soldiers *on* horses), not chariots.
*   **D: Hidhannoo lolaa (War strategy):** The passage discusses a physical limitation (lack of saddles) not a strategic one."
Waraanniwwan loltoota fardeenii hirmaachise akkamitti gaggeeffame?,"The correct answer is **C: Fardarra taa’anii**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Kavalaryiiin loltu dugda fardaa irra taa’ee loluu dha"" which translates to ""Cavalry soldiers fought by being on horseback.""  This directly answers the question of how the cavalry participated in warfare.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lafoo** - The text doesn't mention anything about ""lafoo"" (which likely means shields).
*   **B: Hidhannoo lolaa malee** -  This translates to ""without battle formation,"" which isn't described in the text.
*   **D: Loltoota xiqqaadhan** - This means ""small soldiers"" and isn’t related to *how* they fought, but to their size.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, lammii Baabiloon kan hin argamne eessaati?","Correct answer: **A: Mana sagadaa alasaatti aarsaa fiduu**

Here's why:

*   **The passage describes a very specific, regulated form of worship in Babylon.** People worshiped in temples, priests had specific roles and access, and festivals were structured.
*   **Option A (""worshiping at a private shrine"")** represents something *outside* of this established system. The passage doesn't mention personal or private worship spaces. It focuses entirely on the public, organized religious practices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mana sagadaa isa guddatti sirna waaqeffannaarratti argamuu** - The passage *describes* worship happening in temples.
*   **C: Festivaala mana sagadaa alatti taasifamurratti** - Festivals are specifically mentioned as a way people engaged with their religion.
*   **D: Iddoo aarsaa isa keessatti aarsaa fiduu** - This is exactly what the passage describes happening in the temples.

Mootii Tuutankamun kabaja (notoriety) kan dhabe yoom ture?,"The correct answer is **A: Awwaalli isaa hatamuu hordofee** (Following the discovery of his tomb).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Wanti baay’ee bara duriitti inni akka nama i baayee barbaachisaatti hin fudhatamne, akkasumas galmeewwan moototaa durii irratti hin galmoofne. Haa ta’uuyyu malee, argamni bakka awwaalchaa kana bara 1922 tti akka beekamuu isa taasisee.""  This translates to: ""He wasn't considered very important in ancient times and wasn't mentioned in royal histories. However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous.""

This directly indicates that his fame (kabaja) came *after* his tomb was discovered. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yeroo inni mo’u** (When he died) - The passage doesn't suggest he was famous at the time of his death, quite the opposite.
* **C: Erga awwaalli isaa argameen booda** (After his tomb was found) - This is close, but ""following the discovery"" is more precise, as it implies his fame *resulted* from the discovery.
* **D: Tarreewwaan mootota duriirratti erga eeramee booda** (After being mentioned in the records of previous kings) - The text explicitly states he *wasn't* mentioned in those records.



"
Mootii Tuutan kamun mootii Masirii beekamaa kan taasise maali?,"Correct answer: **A: Awwaalli isaa osoo hin diigamin argamuu**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Argamni bakka awwaalchaa kana bara 1922 tti akka beekamuu isa taasisee."" (The discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous). The text highlights that despite not being initially considered important in ancient times, his *untouched* tomb's discovery is what brought him fame.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: sadarakaa inni tarree mootota duriirratti qabu:** The passage states he wasn't initially considered important (""Wanti baay’ee bara duriitti inni akka nama i baayee barbaachisaatti hin fudhatamne"").
*   **C: Awwaalasaa keessaa bobbocawwan kumaatamni heddu hatamuu:** While the treasures were significant, the *discovery* of the intact tomb is what initially made him famous, not the treasures themselves.
*   **D: Bara Masirii duriitti beekamtii ykn barbaachisummaa isaa:**  The text directly states he *lacked* recognition in ancient times.



"
Walaleessaan Giriikii Homeer waanti inni gochuu hin dandeenye maal ture?,"The correct answer is **D: Dubbachuu** (Speaking).

Here's why:

The passage states Homer was a ""barreessa goota qaroo dhabeessa"" - a blind poet/author. While he *created* stories meant to be spoken, he himself was unable to see, not unable to speak. The other options aren't relevant to the information given in the text.

*   **A: Dhaga’uu** (Hearing) - The passage doesn't mention anything about his hearing.
*   **B: Arguu** (Seeing) - The passage specifically states he was blind.
*   **C: Deemuu** (Moving) - The passage doesn't mention anything about his ability to move."
Beekamaan Giriikii hog-barruun alatti waan biraan beekamu eenyudhaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Paayitaagorasii**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hayyuu beekamaan Giriikii biraan, ogeessa herregaa Paayitaagorasidha, isa seerota aljeebiraa isaa waa’ee hariiroowwan rogawwan rogsadee roga qajeelaatiin beekamu."" This directly says Paayitaagoras is known for his mathematical work *besides* being a prominent Greek figure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Soofokilas** - The passage identifies him as a playwright, not someone known for something *besides* being Greek.
*   **B: Homeer** - The passage describes him as the most famous Greek author, but doesn't mention other areas of expertise.
*   **D: Aristofeens** - Similar to Soofokilas, he's known as a playwright.



"
Maatin Ibrootaa yeroo heddu eessatti dabarsu?,"The correct answer is **A: Bakka baaxin isaa banaa ta’e** (In open spaces/fields).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Jireenyi warra Ibrootaa hedduun isaa qilleensa banaa keessattidha."" This translates to ""The life of the Hebrews was mostly in the open air/fields.""  This directly indicates they spent a lot of time outside.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Daandii irra (On the road)** - While they may have traveled, the text doesn't emphasize that as their primary living space.
* **C: Bakka manaan ala (Outside the house)** - This is too general. ""Open air/fields"" is more specific and aligns with the text.
* **D: Mana keessa (Inside the house)** - The text implies the *opposite* – they didn’t have many houses and lived largely outside.



"
Maatii Ibrootaaf waanti baay’ee barbaachisaa hin taane maal ture?,"The correct answer is **C: Mana isaanii**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Haala qillensaa Giddugala Bahaa keessatti, **manni baay’ee barbaachisaa hinturre**."" This directly translates to ""In the climate of the Middle East, **houses were very necessary and expensive**.""  The passage then goes on to describe how difficult it was to build homes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Haala qilleensa isaanii (Their climate)** - While the climate is mentioned, the passage says *houses* were necessary *because* of the climate, not that the climate itself was the missing necessity.
* **B: Kuusaa isaanii (Their strength)** - The passage doesn't discuss the strength of the Hebrews.
* **D: Nyaata qopheessuu isaanii (Preparing food)** - The passage mentions women harvesting, but doesn't state food preparation was the main need.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa akka garaa garummaa biyyoota Iskaandineeviyaanitti kan hin ibsamne kami?,"Correct answer is **B: Lafa**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions differences in:

*   **Seenicha (History):** ""...seenaa Deenimark, Swidiin, Norweeyi fi Ayiisland giddu...""
*   **Aadaawwan (Customs/Culture):** ""...amala..."" (which refers to behavior and customs)
*   **Uummaticha (People):** ""...namoota..."" and differences in rulers (""mootota"") imply differences in the people.

However, the passage **does not** discuss any geographical differences (""Lafa"") between the Scandinavian countries. It focuses on cultural, historical, and people-related distinctions.

Therefore, ""Lafa"" is the aspect of Scandinavian countries *not* mentioned as being different in the passage."
Jalqaba Giriinland keessa kan qubate eenyu?,"Correct answer: **A: Gosa Eskimoo**

**Explanation:**

The text states: ""argannoo isaan alatti, gosootni Iskimoo durumaan iyyuu achi jiraachaa turan."" This directly translates to ""besides their discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there.""  Therefore, the Eskimo tribes were the first inhabitants of Greenland.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Norweejinaatota:** The text mentions Erik the Red (a Norseman) discovering/settling Greenland *after* the Eskimos were already there.
* **C: Erik isa Diimticha:** Erik the Red is mentioned as someone who *came* to Greenland, not the first to inhabit it.
* **D: Siwidinoota:** The text does not mention Swedes being the first inhabitants."
Gareen minjaala osoo hin fayyadamin nyaata nyaachuu fedhan kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Dhiirota Roomaa dureeyyii**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""yeroo namonnii harka qaleeyyii fi dubartittiin teessoo irra taa’anii nyaata isaanii nyaatan, namoonni dureeyyiin cinaa isaaniitiin irkatanii nyaachuu jaallatan."" This translates to: ""while some people preferred to eat their food while sitting/leaning on couches with their elbows off the table, men particularly liked to eat reclining with their slaves.""

This directly indicates that **men (dhiirota Roomaa)** specifically preferred to eat while **reclining (dureeyyii)**.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa sirna nyaata Roomaa Durii kan hin taane kami?,"Correct answer is **D: Nyaata waaddii lukkuu tarkii**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states:** ""Namni Roomaa kamiyyu tarkii qammasee hin beeku."" (No Roman knew about squash/pumpkin). This directly contradicts option D.

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with the text:

*   **A: Keessummoonni hiyyeeyyin minjaalarratti nyaatu** (Eating snails on a bed of herbs) - The passage mentions various meats including those from unusual animals, suggesting this would fit.
*   **B: Cilalluu akka fedha nyaataa namaa banutti** (Mushrooms as a desired food) - The text lists mushrooms (""ciilalluu"") as part of the Roman diet.
*   **C: Dhiironni dureeyyin yeroo irbaataa ni rafu** (Men reclining and being fed by women) - The passage describes Romans eating while reclining and being fed by others, indicating this practice.



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’un, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa dhiibbaa yeroo dheeraa kan hin qabne kami?","Correct answer: **B: Aadaa xiiqqaa**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""Aadaan qaroominaa beekumsi dhalootaa gara dhalootaatti daddarbuu isaa agarsiisa, faana aadaa yeroo dheeraaf turuufi faffaca’iinsa loogii hinqabne."" (National character shows transmission from generation to generation, a long-lasting tradition and without logical change.) This indicates that national character *does* have a long-lasting effect.

The passage also discusses the long history of civilizations and cities. 

However, the passage implies that **fleeting/temporary traditions (Aadaa xiiqqaa)** are not essential for understanding national character and may not be passed down through generations, meaning they don't have a long-term impact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hawaasa (Society):** The passage begins by defining national character as something shared within a society, therefore it is fundamental.
*   **C: Bulchiinsa magaalaa (City governance):** The passage states that city-states were the beginnings of nations, suggesting they are related to long-term developments.
*   **D: Aadaa qaroominaa (National character):** The passage clearly states this *does* have a long-lasting effect.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, biyya kan dursu maalidha?","The correct answer is **A: Aadaa qaroominaa** (National identity/culture).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Biyyoota dura eegalan **aadaan qaroominaa** beekumsi dhalootaa gara dhalootaatti daddarbuu isaa agarsiisa..."" (Early civilizations showed the transmission of **national identity/culture** from generation to generation...).

The passage directly links early civilizations to the transmission of national identity/culture. The other options are not the primary focus of this statement within the text.



"
Waa’ee Drukgyal Dzong himni sirrii hin taane kami?,"Correct answer is **B: Bakki argamasaa Buutani**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states Drukgyal Dzong is located in the Paro District (within the Phondey area), not Bhutan generally. While Paro is *in* Bhutan, the passage doesn't say the Dzong itself is in Bhutan. It's more specific.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: Mo’icha humnoota Tibetan-Mongol kabajuudhaf ijaarame** - The passage directly says it was built to commemorate a victory over Tibetan-Mongol forces.
*   **C: Meeshaalen dahannoo hedduun abidaan bade** - The passage states it was damaged by fire in 1951 and later restored.
*   **D: Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel dhaan uumame** - The passage says it was built by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel in 1649."
Abidda Drukgyal Dzong tti mudate booda waan uumame himni sirriitti ibsu kami?,"Correct answer is **A: Meeshaan tokkichi hafe suura Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal qofa**

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Bara 1951, abiddi hafteen Diraakiyaal Zoongi muraasni, kan akka suuraa Haamdiraangi Gawaangi Naamgiyeel qofti akka hafu taasise..."" which translates to ""In 1951, the fire that broke out during the time of Dirakial Zong, only the portrait of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal was lost.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Humnoonni Tibetan-Mongol mo’anii turan:** The text mentions the victory *over* Tibetan-Mongol forces, not that they were lost in the fire.
*   **C: Hawwannaan beekamtiin isaa hin dhiibban irra hin geenye:** The text doesn’t discuss whether the temple's reputation was diminished.
*   **D: Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel dhaan eegame:** The text says he *commissioned* the building, not that he was lost in the fire."

Walii galteen Shimonoseki maal hundeesse?,"Correct answer: **D: Angoo Jaappan Taayiwaan irratti**

Here's why:

The passage states, ""...mootummaan Qing walii galtee Shimonoseki mallatteesse, kan ittin olaantummaa Taayiwaanii hanga Jaapaanitti qabu gad-dhiifame..."" This directly means the treaty ceded control of Taiwan to Japan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waraana Sino-Japanese Jalqabaa irratti mo’amuu Jaappan:** While the treaty *followed* the war, it didn't simply acknowledge Japan's victory. It transferred territory.
*   **B: Daayinaastii Qing jalatti Taayiwaan akka sadarkaa bulchiinsatti ta’uu:** The treaty removed Qing control, not established it.
*   **C: Taayiwan naannolee qarqara galaanaa deebistee to’achuu danda’uu:** The passage doesn't mention anything about territorial returns.



"
Sadarkaan keemikaala pH akkamitti safarama?,"Correct answer is **C: Hamma ayonoota Hayidiroojiinii keemikaalicha keessa jiran**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Sadarkaan pH hamma aayonoota haayidiroojiinii (H pH keessaa) keemikaala qoratame sana keessaatiin ibsama."" (The pH level is expressed by the amount of hydrogen ions (H pH) in the chemical being examined.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Keemikaalichi hammam beezii ykn asiidii akka qabu** - While pH *indicates* acidity or alkalinity, it *measures* the concentration of hydrogen ions.
*   **B: Pirootoononni meeqa keemikaalicha keessa akka jiran** - While hydrogen ions are protons, pH specifically measures the *number of ions*, not just protons generally.
*   **D: Elektiroononni meeqa keemikaalicha keessa akka jiran** - pH is related to hydrogen *ions* (which involve protons), not the total number of electrons."
Ayonoota Hayidiroojiinii keessaa maaltu haqame?,"Correct answer: **D: Elektiroonota**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ayoniin haayidiroojiinii pirotoonii elektiroonii isaan balleessu qaba (atoomiin haayidiroojiiniin pirotoonii tokkoo fi elektiroonii tokko waan qabuuf)."" This directly translates to ""Hydrogen ions lose protons and electrons (a hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron).""

Therefore, the text explicitly says hydrogen ions are stripped of **electrons**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pirootoonota (Protons):** While hydrogen ions *have* protons, the text says they *lose* protons, not that protons are lost *from* hydrogen ions.
*   **B: pH:** pH is a *scale* used to measure acidity/alkalinity, not something lost by hydrogen ions.
*   **C: Alkaaliinii (Alkalinity):** Alkalinity describes a type of chemical, not something hydrogen ions lose."

Here's why:

The text states that leencots often live in large families - brothers and sisters and offspring. This suggests a social structure where interactions *within* the family are common, not necessarily aggressive encounters between unrelated males and females.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

*   **A: Baay’ee namatti siqu** - The text states “Leencotni adurreewwan hunda caalaa hawaasummaa qaban” (Leencots are the most sociable of all reptiles).
*   **B: Amalli isaanii kan yeeyyii waliin wal madaala** - The text says their behavior is similar to that of monkeys or squirrels.
*   **D: Amalli isaanii gosa adureewwanii biroo wajjin wal fakkaata** - The text states they can be mistaken for other reptiles, though distinct from major reptiles.

Therefore, option C is the only statement that isn't supported by the provided text."
Hilleettii bineensota gosa kamtu adamsa?,"The correct answer is **A: Adureewwan xixiqqoo** (Small birds).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Adurreewwan xixiqqoo hedduutu jira (Adurreewwan badaan kan mana dabalate) kanneen ilbiisota, waan lafarra deemu, loocuu, fi sinbirroo nyaatu.""  This translates to: ""There are many small birds (birds besides those in the house) that eat grasshoppers, worms, and sparrows.""

The question asks which birds are mentioned as eating insects, worms, and sparrows - clearly referring to the ""Adureewwan xixiqqoo"" (small birds)."
Adurreewwan xixiqqoon kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kam adamsu?,"The correct answer is **A: Hantuuta ykn fuliyoo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Adurreewwan xixiqqoo hedduutu jira (Adurreewwan badaan kan mana dabalate) kanneen ilbiisota, waan lafarra deemu, loocuu, fi sinbirroo nyaatu."" This describes small creatures that eat insects, stay on the ground, eat snails, and eat birds.  Hantuuta (weasel) and fuliyoo (polecat) fit this description.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hilleettii (Eagle):** Eagles are birds of prey and are *hunted* by these small predators, not the other way around.
* **C: Gadamsa (Lion):** Lions are large predators and definitely not small creatures that eat insects and snails.
* **D: Bosonuu (Gazelle):** Gazelles are prey animals, not predators that eat insects and birds.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa qaama mala ittiin qeerransa (ocelo) adamsan kan hin taane kami?,"The correct answer is **D: Bineensota xixiqoo qofa adamsu** (Only preying on small animals).

Here's why:

The passage states the ocelot preys on **qamalee, bofa, xuqaa fi sinbirroota** (birds, deer, sheep and poultry). This clearly indicates it doesn't *only* eat small animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Naannoo isaan jiran baala wayii daheeffatanii dhokachuu** (Deceiving by lying in wait near them): The passage states the ocelot lies in wait to hunt.
*   **B: Foolii waan isaan adamsanii faana dhahuu** (Being pleased when they catch prey): The passage states they follow prey and actively seek it.
*   **C: Yeroo halkanii waan isaan adamsan faana dhahuu** (Being pleased when they catch prey while stalking): The passage mentions they can easily see in the dark and stalk their prey.

Therefore, option D is the only statement that contradicts information provided in the text."
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa qeerransa sirriitti kan hin ibsine kami? ,"The correct answer is **C: Dandeettin suufuu isaanii dadhabaadha** (Their ability to swim is limited).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the ocelot is a good swimmer:** ""...rakkoo tokko malee suuta jedhanii deemu..."" which translates to ""...they swim without any difficulty...""  Therefore, saying their swimming ability is limited is *incorrect* and not supported by the text.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

* **A: Yeroo halkanii sirriitti adamsuu danda’u** (They can be clearly seen when they roar) - The passage states ""Dukkana keessatti agartuu halkaniitiin sirriitti arguu danda’u"" (They can be clearly seen in the dark when they roar).
* **B: Qaxxisa deemu** (They are stealthy) - The passage implies stealth: “Adurreen bosonaa yemmuu adamsu warra adamfaman naannoo isaatti siksuun adamsee nyaata” (When a forest animal descends, it stalks those around it and eats them).  Stalking requires stealth.
* **D: Bineensota xixiqqoo adamsuu filatu** (They prefer to hunt small animals) - The passage begins with ""Oselootni bineeldota xixqqoo nyaachuu jaalatu"" (Ocelots like to eat small animals).

Here's why:

The passage states that tigers are known for being able to do five things that require great human strength: *running very fast (possibly for long distances), jumping, climbing great heights, and enduring severe hardship.*

Let's look at the options:

*   **Aaduu (Digging):** While tigers might dig a little, it's not a defining display of their incredible strength.
*   **Koruu (Climbing):** The passage *specifically* mentions climbing great heights as one of their strengths.
*   **Utaaluu (Jumping):** The passage *specifically* mentions jumping as one of their strengths.
*   **Harkisuu (Singing):** The passage discusses the tiger's vocalizations, comparing it to a lion's roar or the cry of a hyena, but it doesn't suggest that *singing* is a demonstration of their strength. It's a vocalization, not a feat of physical power.

Therefore, **Harkisuu (Singing)** is the activity that doesn't relate to the tiger's immense physical strength as described in the text.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessa garaa garummaa qeerransaa fi leenca gidduu jiru kan ta’e kami?","The correct answer is **B: Sagalee aaduu isaanii** (Their way of vocalizing).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Sagaleen qerransaa akka sagalee guutuu leenca bookkisuu mitii, garuu akka hima iyyaa, jechotaa iyyaa fakkata."" This translates to ""The sound of a cheetah is not like the deep roar of a leopard, but like the yelp of a hyena, resembling hyena sounds.""  This directly contrasts how cheetahs and leopards vocalize.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dandeettii bishaan daakuu isaanii** (Their ability to drink water) - The passage doesn't mention anything about how they drink water.
* **C: Fageenya isaan utaalan** (The distances they run) - While the passage mentions they run long distances, it doesn't specify a *difference* in running distance between cheetahs and leopards. It says they both run long distances.
* **D: Humna ittiin harkisan** (The strength they use to push) - The passage doesn't talk about pushing strength. It mentions their general physical power, but not how it differs between cheetahs and leopards.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, baayolojistoota kaan dura Roobart Hooke maal hojjate?","The correct answer is **D: Yuunitiiwwan organizimii hojjatan xixiqqoo argate**.

Here's why:

* The passage states Robert Hooke was the *first* to see these small units (cells) within cork using a microscope.  The passage implies that prior to Hooke, biologists hadn't identified these fundamental building blocks of life.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Seeliwwan du’an ilaala:** The text says he looked at *dead* cells, but it doesn't say previous biologists did the same. It's about the *discovery* of the cells, not just looking at dead ones.
* **B: Orgaanizimii ilaaluf maayikirooskoppii fayyadama:** While it's likely biologists *used* microscopes before Hooke, the passage focuses on what Hooke specifically *saw* with the microscope - something new.
* **C: Isquweeriiwwan muraasa ilaala:**  He saw structures that *looked like* small rooms (squares), but the important part is he recognized them as fundamental units, not just that they were square-shaped.



"
Hiikni bu’uuraa jecha “seelii” jedhuu maalidha?,"The correct answer is **B: Kutaa xiqqoo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Seeliin jecha laatinii seelaa jechuunis kutaa xiqqoo jechu ta’ee irraa dhufee."" This directly translates to ""The cell, from the Latin word 'seela', means a small compartment/part.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Isquweeriwwan xixiqqoo (Small squares)** - The text doesn't mention shapes like squares.
*   **C: Caasaa yk istiraakcharii xiqqaa (A case or small structure)** - While a cell *is* a structure, ""kutaa xiqqoo"" is the *direct* translation of the origin of the word ""cell"" as given in the text.
*   **D: Kubbaawwan xixiqqoo (Small spheres/balls)** - The text mentions cells being observed in things like cork and refers to them as ""rog-arfee"" (plugs/stoppers) and ""kubbaawwan xixiqqoo"" as *things cells are found in*, not what cells *are*.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, bineensonni heddi dandeettii maal gochuu qabu?","The correct answer is **B: Socho’uu** (to think/reason).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bineensonni baay’een socho’uu danda’u."" (Many insects can think/reason.)  This directly answers the question about what ability insects *have* according to the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Balali’uu** (to fly) - While the text says some insects fly, it doesn’t state it’s a defining ability *all* insects have.
*   **C: Bishaan daakuu** (to drink water) -  The text mentions they can drink water, but it doesn't say it's a defining ability.
*   **D: Qotuu** (to dig) - The text says they dig in the ground, but doesn't say it's a defining ability.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, bineensonni tokko tokko maal hin qabne?","Correct answer is **C: Sammuu**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bineeldota qofaatu sammuu qaba (yooma bineeldnotni hunduu qabaachuu baatan illee; qurxummiiwwan jeelii, fakkeenyaf, sammuu hin qaban)."" This directly translates to ""Only mammals have brains (even if not all mammals always have them; for example, insects do not have brains).""

Therefore, bineensonni (insects) do not have sammuu (brains). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Seeliwwan (Cells)**: The text states bineensonni seeloota baay'ee irraa umaman (insects are made of many cells), so they *have* cells.
*   **B: Dandeettii nyaata bulleessuu (The ability to store food)**: The text says they ""Wantoota nyaatanii of keessatti bulleessu"" (store food inside themselves), so they *have* this ability.
*   **D: Dandeettii nyaachuu (The ability to eat)**: The text implies they eat (""Wantoota nyaatanii""), so they *have* this ability."
Adeemsa footoosentesisii keessatti maaltu biqiloota gargaara?,"Correct answer is **D: Aduu**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Biqiltoonni nyaata isaanii karaa footosentesisii aduu irraa qopheeffattu."" This directly translates to ""Plants prepare their food through photosynthesis from the sun (aduu)."" 

Therefore, the sun (aduu) is what helps plants in the process of photosynthesis."
Namoonni kan gara alaatti baasan biqiloonni ammoo gara keessatti kan fudhatan maalidha?,"The correct answer is **D: Kaarbondaayi oksaayidii (Carbon dioxide)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Biqiloonni Oksijiinii isa dhalli namaa keessa isaatti harganu Oomishu, **kaarboondaayioksaayidii isa namni gadi baasu immo biqiloonni ni fayyaadamu.**"" 

This translates to: ""Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in, but **they use the carbon dioxide that humans breathe out.**""

Therefore, humans breathe *out* carbon dioxide, and plants take it *in*. The question asks what humans give off that plants take in."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, fakkeenyota armaan gadii keessaa adeemsa tirannaa kan daangessu kami?","Correct answer is **B: Gareen hawaasa (population) tokkoo naannoo haaratti deemuu**.

Here's why:

The passage describes speciation as a process where a small, isolated population (like one separated by a mountain or water) develops different traits and adaptations to survive in its *new environment*. This aligns directly with a population *moving to a new area*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gareewwan muraasni bakka haaratti milkaa’uu dhabuu:** This describes extinction, not speciation.
*   **C: Hawaasni tokko naannoo haaraa keessatti yeroo madaquu isaa tolfatu:** This refers to adaptation *within* a population, but not the splitting into new species.
*   **D: Hawaasni tokko yeroon booda lama ta’uu:** While this is the *result* of speciation, it doesn't describe the initial process that *causes* it. It's the outcome, not the mechanism.



"
Himoota armaan gadii keessaa adeemsa sanyiin haaraa uumamuu (speciation) sirriitti kan hin ibsine kami? ,"Correct answer is **D: Uumamuun isaa waan hin oolledha**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that speciation *can* and *does* happen.** It describes the process of a small group becoming isolated, adapting to a new environment, and eventually becoming so different they are no longer recognized as the same species.  Saying it ""cannot be created"" directly contradicts the text.

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with the passage:

* **A: Yeroo hawaasni tokko madaquu dadhabu uumama** - This is a key element of the passage. Isolation (being separated by a geographic barrier like mountains or water) is the first step towards speciation.
* **B: Adeemsa tiraannaa keessatti murteessadha** - The passage mentions natural selection and adaptation to new environments, which are core components of evolution and operate through the process of variation.
* **C: Sanyiin haaran uumamuu agarsiisa** - The entire passage is *about* the formation of new species (speciation).

Therefore, option D is the only one that doesn't align with the information provided in the text."
Kutaa marsaa dhiigaa keessaa dhiiga gara onneetti kan geessu kami?,"The correct answer is **D: Veeniwwan** (Veins).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ujummoowwan veeyinii jedhamaniin gara onneetti kan deebi’udha."" This directly translates to ""Blood returns to the heart through veins.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Artariiwwan (Arteries):** The passage says arteries carry blood *away* from the heart, not *to* it.
* **B: Kappilariiwwan (Capillaries):** Capillaries are tiny vessels where exchange happens, they don't primarily *carry* blood to the heart.
* **C: Orgaanota (Organs):** Organs receive blood, they don't directly transport it back to the heart.



"
Marsaa dhiigaa keessatti ujummoo kamtu xiqqaadha?,"The correct answer is **A: Kappilariiwwan**.

The passage states: ""Ujummoowwan hundarra xixiqqoon kaappilaaroota jedhamu."" which translates to ""All vessels have small ones called capillaries."" 

Therefore, capillaries are the smallest vessels in the circulatory system."
Ilbiisonii baallee isaanii gara boodetti dachaasuu danda’uun isaanii kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu akka dabalu godha?,"Correct answer: **B: Bakka dhokannaa**

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Ilbiisonni baay’een carraa koochoo isaanii qaama isaanii wajjiin gara duubaatti dachaasuu qabu. Kun bineensa isaan balleessu jalaa dhokachuuf bakka ta’u xixiqqaa carraa guddaa waliin kennaf.""  This directly translates to: ""Many grasshoppers must push their eggs with their bodies forward. This is to escape the predator that would destroy them, replacing a small chance with a big chance of survival.""

Therefore, the ability to move their eggs allows them to **escape predators** (bakka dhokannaa) and increase their chances of survival.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dhiyeessii nyaataa (Food supply):** While grasshoppers need to find food, the passage doesn't link egg-moving to food access.
*   **C: Hiriyaa barbaaduu (Finding mates):**  The passage mentions finding companions through leaping, not egg-moving.
*   **D: Saffisa balalii (Leaping ability):** Leaping is mentioned as a separate advantage, but the passage focuses on the *benefit of moving eggs* specifically related to predator avoidance.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa dandeettii balalii ilbiisotaatin waanta dhiiban irra hin geenye kan kuticha keessatti hin eeramin kami?,"Correct Answer: **B: Umurii jiraatan**

Here's why:

The text focuses on the *ability* (dandeettii) of lizards to detach their tails to escape predators, find food, and find mates. It specifically mentions how this ability helps them survive. 

*   **A: Wal-hormaata (Reproduction):** The text states that lizards use tail detachment to find mates (""hiriyyaa ga'umsaan argachuuf"").
*   **C: Soorata sassaabuu (Camouflage):** Detaching the tail distracts predators allowing the lizard to escape - a form of evasion.
*   **D: Dandeettii (Ability):** This is the central theme of the passage – the lizards' ability to detach their tails.
*   **B: Umurii jiraatan (Lifespan):** The text doesn't mention anything about the lifespan of lizards or how tail detachment affects their age. It’s about *what they can do*, not *how long they live*.

Therefore, the lifespan of lizards is not discussed or hinted at within the context of the passage."
Amaloota armaan gadii keessaa daayinoosaroota wajjin yeroo baay’ee kan wal-qabanne kami?,"Correct answer: **A: Miila duuban deemuu**

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""akkasumas miilla isaanii duubaatiin akka T-Reeksitti deemu"" which translates to ""and their legs are shaped like a T-Rex"". This directly links the Simbir (dinosaur-like creatures) to having legs that are shaped/positioned in a way similar to a T-Rex's legs - meaning they are thick and stand with a bent posture. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Baallee kan hin qabne** - The text says they *have* wings and people mistake them for dinosaurs *because* of the wings.
*   **C: Hanqaaquu kan buusu** - The text only states that they ""busuu"" (breathe/hiss), it doesn’t specify that it’s from a beak.
*   **D: Miilla qeensa qabu** - The text describes them having *jabaa* (strong/robust) legs, not slender ones.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa amaloota simbirroonni fi daayinoosaroonni qaban kan hin taane kami?,"Correct answer: **D: Miilla qeensaa wajjin**

Here's why:

*   **The text states:** Simbirroonni miilla foon jabaa fi qoronyoo qabu qabu, buphaa ni busuu, akkasumas miilla isaanii duubaatiin akka T-Reeksitti deemu. (Simbirroonni strong legs and claws qaba, busuu, and their legs are shaped like a T-Rex.)

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Hanqaaquu buusuu** - The text mentions they can roar/busuu.
*   **B: Deemuf miila duubaa lamaan fayyadamuu** - The text specifically says their legs are shaped like T-Rex legs.
*   **C: Balali’uu danda’uu** - The text says people often mistake them for dinosaurs because they have scales and therefore look like dinosaurs.
*   **D: Miilla qeensaa wajjin** - The text states they have *foon jabaa* and *qoronyoo* (strong legs and claws) and doesn't mention anything about having wings.

Therefore, having wings is not a characteristic of the Simbirroonni described in the text."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kutaa muka saayikad (cycad plant) Tirayisraatops (Triceratops) nyaachuu danda’an kami?","The correct answer is **A: Baala qaqalloo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that scientists believe Triceratops ate cycads, which are described as having ""muka teemirii isa baalli qaqqaramaan isaa walitti guujja’ee mataarra taa’u fakkaatu"" - meaning they had a cone-like structure with scales.  This translates to a scaled cone, or a ""baala qaqalloo"" (scaled cone).

The passage specifically mentions the Triceratops using its beak to *remove* the scales from the cones before eating, indicating the scales were a part of what they were consuming.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessa Tirayisraatops nyaachuu danda’u kami? ","The correct answer is **B: Biqiloota damee cimaa qaban** (Plants with strong stems).

Here's why:

The passage states Triceratops ate cycads, which are described as having ""damee bayyee cimaa"" (very strong stems) and resembling palm trees with a thick trunk.  The passage also mentions they didn't eat the whole plant, just the leaves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bineensa akka osolee** (Like oslo/oxen beef) - The passage doesn't mention Triceratops eating meat.
*   **C: Paarotii** (Parrots) - The passage focuses on plant life, not animals.
*   **D: Biqiloota firii summaa’aa qaban** (Plants with a sour taste) - While the passage discusses the possibility of cycads being toxic, it doesn't say Triceratops *specifically* ate sour-tasting plants. It highlights that even today, animals avoid toxic plants.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, ispoortiwwan armaan gadii keessaa naannolee kaaba Xaaliyaanitti beekamaa kan ta’e kami?","The correct answer is **A: Kubbaa miilaa (Football/Soccer)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Taphni bonaa baay’ee beekamaa dha naannoo kaabaatti, akkuma Xaaliyaanotni taphaa addunyaa guutuufi taphoota Olompikiif dorgomaa jiran."" This translates to ""Football is a very popular sport in the north, as Italians compete in the World Cup and Olympic Games.""

While other sports are mentioned as being popular *in* Italy, the passage specifically highlights football as the popular sport in the *north* of Italy."
"Odeeffannoo kuticha keessatti kenname irratti hundaa’un, ispoortiwwan armaan gadii keessaa Xaaliyaanin shaampiyoonii addunyaa kan ittiin taate kami?","Correct answer: **A: Kubbaa miilaa**

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly states: ""Gareen kubbaa miillaa biyyaalessaa Xaaliyaanii fi gareen kubbaa miillaa biyyaalessaa Jarmanii addunyaa kana irratti gareewwan hunda caalaa milkaa’oo sadarkaa lammaffaa irratti argamanidha, akkasumas bara 2006 keessa warra Waancaa Addunyaa FIFA mo’atan turan."" This directly says Italy has been a world champion in football (soccer)."
Taatee kam booda kutaalen Lugzambarg muraasni Beeljiyeem ta’an?,"Correct Answer: **B: Warraaqsa Beeljiyeem**

**Explanation:**

The text states: ""Baroota darbaanitti kutaa Beeljem ammaa kutaa Luuzeenbergi turan garuu bara 1830tti warraqsaa warraa Beeljemiin booda,kan Beeljem taasifame."" This directly translates to: ""Previously, parts of Belgium were part of Luxembourg, but after the Belgian revolution in 1830, they became part of Belgium."" 

Therefore, the parts of Luxembourg becoming Belgian territory happened *after* the Belgian revolution (Warraaqsa Beeljiyeem).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waraana Addunyaa I (World War I):** The text says Luxembourg was *occupied* by Germany during both World Wars, but not that it lost territory to Belgium then.
*   **C: Waraana Addunyaa II (World War II):** Same as above – occupation, not territorial loss.
*   **D: Hudaa’uu Gamtaa Awurooppaa (Establishment of the European Union):**  This happened much later and is about Luxembourg *joining* an organization, not losing territory."
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa garee kamuu deeggaruu dhabuu (neutrality) Lukzambarg irratti dhiibbaa kan qabaate kami?,"Correct answer is **A: Weerara Jarmanii**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that Luxembourg *repeatedly tried to remain independent* but was *occupied by Germany* in both World War I and World War II. This occupation directly hindered its neutrality.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Gamtaa Awurooppatti makamuu (Joining the European Union):** Joining the EU is a matter of political and economic integration, not a restriction of neutrality.
*   **C: Warraaqsa Beeljiyeem (Belgian secession):** While the text mentions the Belgian secession as historical context, it doesn't describe it as a force that prevented Luxembourg's neutrality.
*   **D: Biyya walabaa ta’uu (Being a small country):**  Being small doesn't inherently prevent neutrality; many small countries have maintained it successfully. The key issue was external force (German occupation)."
Bal’ina Turkiin qabdu keessaa iskuweer kilomeetirii meeqatu Awurooppaa keessa jira?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The text states: ""...kan keessaa iskuweer kiloometirii 755,688 (291,773 sq mi) kan ta’u naannoo Eeshiyaa kibba lixaatti akkasuma **iskuweer kiloometiri 23,764 (9,174 sq mi) kan ta’ummoo Awuurroppatit dha.**"" 

This directly answers the question of how much of Turkey's landmass is in Europe.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, Turkiin maayilii meeqa dheeratti?","The correct answer is **D: 1000**.

The text states: ""Daangaan Tuurkii kiiloo meetira 1600 (maayilii 1,000) caalaa dheerata..."" which translates to ""Turkey's coastline is longer than 1600 kilometers (1,000 miles)...""

Therefore, Turkey is over 1000 miles long."
Magaala Vaatikaanif afaan Laatiinii maalif fayyada?,"The correct answer is **A: Sagantaalee amantii**.

The text states: ""Latiin ammo ayyanoota Amantiif fayyadamaamu"" which translates to ""Latin is used for religious ceremonies."" 

Therefore, Latin is used for religious purposes in Vatican City.



"
Vaatikaan keessatti afaan Xaaliyaanii kan dhimma itti hin bahamne maalifi?,"The correct answer is **C: Sagantaalee amantii**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Afaan Xaaliyanii seera hiikuu fi quunnamtii seraatiif fayyadamaamu. Latiin ammo ayyanoota Amantiif fayyadamaamu.""  This directly translates to: ""Italian is used for enacting laws and legal procedures. Latin, however, is used for religious ceremonies.""

Therefore, Latin is specifically reserved for religious ceremonies (Sagantaalee amantii), meaning Italian isn't used for those purposes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Seera** - Italian *is* used for laws.
*   **B: Qunnamtii seera qabeessa** - Italian is used for legal procedures.
*   **D: Qunnamtii guyyuu keessatti** - The text doesn't mention everyday conversations.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa sagalee kompitaroota ammayyaarratti qindeessuu kan fayyadu kami?","The correct answer is **A: Muuziqaa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Muziqaan yeroo baay’ee kan waraabamuu koompiyuutara walxaxaa ta’an fayadamuun adeemsaa fi sagalee walitti makuudhaani.""  This translates to: ""Music often uses computer hardware to process and combine sounds.""

The question asks what can be adjusted on modern computers. Music is the only option directly related to sound processing and adjustment, as described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Animeeshinii (Animation):** While animation *uses* computers, the passage doesn't mention adjusting animation *on* a computer – it says it's created *within* the computer.
* **C: Fakkiiwwan (Images/Pictures):** The passage mentions images are *done with* computers, but not adjusted on them in the same way as sound.
* **D: Ijaarsa (Development/Construction):** This is too broad and not directly related to the content of the passage.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, manneen hedduun mana fincaanii bishaan ofiin qabu ykn dhangalaasu qaban bakka kamitti argamaniidha?","The correct answer is **A: Mohenjo-daaro**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Magaalonni Haarappaa fi **Moohenjoo-daroo** mana fincaan booliitti bishaan naqamu, kan sirna balfa dhangala’aa walxaxaa ta’een wal agarsiifame mana hunda keessaa qabu turan."" This directly links Mohenjo-daaro to houses with bathing facilities and sophisticated plumbing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Peshiyaa (Persia)** - The passage mentions Persia *having* latrines, not necessarily houses with dedicated bathing facilities.
*   **C: Saantoriinii (Santorini)** - The passage mentions Santorini as having similar plumbing systems, but doesn't specify houses *with* bathing facilities.
*   **D: Chaayinaa (China)** - The passage only states that latrines existed in ancient China, not houses with bathing facilities.



"
Bakkeewwan armaan gadii keessaa malli balfa gatuu ammayyaa kan itti argamu kami?,"The correct answer is **B: Saantoriinii**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hafteen sirna balfa dhangala’aa manneen magaalota Minowaan Kireetii fi **Santoorinii Girikii** keessatti argamanii jiru."" (Remains of advanced plumbing systems have been found in the cities of Minoan Crete and **Santorini, Greece**.)

While Harappa and Mohenjo-daro *had* plumbing, the question asks where it is *currently* found as a model. Santorini is explicitly mentioned as having remains of these systems still present.  The passage simply states that Egypt, Persia, and early China *had* toilets, but doesn't indicate they are models of plumbing today.
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa nama iskeetii yapahatu akka garagalu kan godhu kami?,"Correct answer: **B: Fiixewwan lamaan gabatee iskeetii**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the two ""dhooqni"" (sensations/feelings) in the person's cheeks are what allow them to determine which side the mosquito is on.  The passage describes how the feeling shifts as the mosquito moves from left to right or vice versa.  Therefore, the two sensations on the cheeks are the key to locating the mosquito.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Karvii xiqqaa gabatee iskeetii gajjallaarratti argamu** (Small curves on the surface of the cheek) - While the surface of the cheek is mentioned, the passage focuses on *sensations* not physical features.
*   **C: Dandeettii walii galaa nama iskeetii tapahatuu** (The ability to collectively sense the mosquito) - The passage describes a specific mechanism (the two sensations) not a general ability.
*   **D: Qulqullina cabbii** (The coolness of the cheeks) - While coolness is mentioned, it is not the determining factor for locating the mosquito, the two distinct sensations are.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa iskeetii cabbii ammayyaa irratti qaawwaa argamu sirriitti kan ibsine kami?","Correct answer is **A: Fiixee lama qabaachuu**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states ""Haadduun iskeetii cabbii kan hammayyaa irra jiru **fiixa dachaa** dhooqa koonkeevii isaan jidduu kan qabu dha."" (The head of the horsefly that sits on the horse's back has **two feet** in between the concave sides.) This directly supports the answer that horseflies have two feet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Fiixensaa karvii ta’uu** (Having curved feet) - The text doesn't mention anything about the feet being curved.
*   **C: Konkeevii** (Concave) - While the text mentions concave sides, it's describing where the feet are *located*, not a characteristic of the feet themselves.
*   **D: Gara tokkotti kan duufe** (Moving towards one side) - The text describes the fly moving *with* the horse's movement, not moving towards one side."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, adeemsi atamoonni (atoms) anniisaa hamma barbaadamuu olii ifa keessaa akka badu godhu maalidha?","The correct answer is **B: Hurka footoniwwanii socho’e (stimulated)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a process where atoms, excited by a large amount of light, release photons.** This is the fundamental principle behind stimulated emission.
* **Stimulated emission** is the process where an incoming photon interacts with an excited atom, causing it to release *another* photon with the same properties (wavelength, phase, polarization) as the incoming photon. This is how lasers work, amplifying light.
* The text specifically mentions the atoms *causing* the emission of photons due to the light, pointing to a stimulated process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Carallaa (Absorption):** Absorption is the *opposite* of what's described - it's when atoms *take in* photons, not release them.
* **C: Footoonii (Photons):** Photons are the *result* of the process, not the process itself.
* **D: Hurka carallaa socho’e (Stimulated absorption):** This isn't a standard term and doesn't describe the process described in the passage.



"
Atamiin footoonii akka gadi lakkisu maaltu godha?,"The correct answer is **B: Sochii ifa guddaan uumame** (Intense light excitation).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""atoomonni sababa ifa guddaan ka’aniif, yaa’umsa footoonii ifaaf sababa ta’uu akkasumas ifni akaakuu raadiyeeshiniidha.""  This directly translates to: ""atoms become excited due to intense light, causing the emission of photons, and light is a form of radiation.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Anniisaa hamma barbaadamuu ol ta’e gadi lakkisuu:** (Emitting more than the required amount) - The passage doesn't mention anything about *over*-emission, just emission.
* **C: Sadarkaa ifaa tasgabbaa’aa hin taane:** (Non-equilibrium light level) - While there's an energy change, the passage doesn't frame it as an *imbalance* in light levels.
* **D: Carrallaadhaf ri’aakshinii namatti hin tolle (adverse) agarsiisuu:** (Showing adverse reactions to damage) - The passage doesn't discuss harmful effects.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, ampuulin ibsaa akka hin hojjanne malti taasisa?","The correct answer is **A: Fiiksichariin ifaa sirnaan banamuu dhabuu** (The fixture is not properly grounded).

Here's why:

The passage explains a dangerous situation where a bulb burns out and, when replaced, the new bulb also burns out immediately. This happens because electricity is flowing through the person replacing the bulb due to a lack of proper grounding.  The passage specifically states the need to turn off the switch or unplug the fixture to avoid electricity flowing through *you* to the socket.  A properly grounded fixture would provide a safe path for the electricity to flow, preventing this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sibiila ampuulii qofaa walakkaan sokkeettitti galchuu** (Only touching the bulb filament) - While avoiding touching the metal parts is good practice, it doesn't address the root cause of the problem. The electricity is still flowing through the person, even if only touching the filament.
* **C: Filaamentiin ampuulii keessa jiru gubachuu** (The filament inside the bulb burning out) - This is *what* is happening, not *why* it’s happening repeatedly.  The filament burns out *because* of the excess current.
* **D: Yaa’i elektirikii gara sokkeettii deemu gadi deemuu ykn xiqqaataa deemuu** (The electrical current going to the socket decreasing or becoming weak) - The problem isn't a weak current; it's a current flowing through an unsafe path (the person).



"
Yeroo ampuulii ibsaa jijjiiran kanneen armaan gadii keessaa tuquun balaa kan qabu kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Filaamentii**.

Here's why, based on the provided text:

The text explicitly warns about the danger of electrical current traveling through the socket to the bulb's filament (sibiila) and potentially causing a shock if the socket is touched or if the filament itself touches the socket's interior.  The text stresses the importance of disconnecting the power (switch or fuse) *before* changing a bulb to avoid this risk.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bantuu fi cuftuu (Base and cap):** While you handle these when changing a bulb, they aren’t the direct path for potentially dangerous electricity.
* **C: Gajjaallaa ampuulii (Glass of the bulb):**  Broken glass is a hazard, but the text focuses on electrical shock.
* **D: Keebilii (Cable):** The cable itself isn’t the *source* of the immediate danger when a bulb is being changed; the risk arises from the live electrical connection within the socket and the filament.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, yeroo nikulasiin gargar cabu maaltu uumama?","Correct answer is **A: Pirotooniwwantu argama**

Here's why:

The passage states that when the nucleus is split (like in a fission process), protons are released.  The process described is nuclear fission where a heavy nucleus is split into smaller nuclei, releasing protons and neutrons. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Anniisan gadi lakkifama** - While fission *does* release energy, the passage doesn't specifically say the amount of energy decreases.
* **C: Atamiiwwan tasgabbaa’uu dhabu** - The passage states some atoms *are* unstable, making them easier to split.
* **D: Niwutirooniwwan ni badu** - Neutrons are also released, they aren’t lost.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa bilbila fageenyarraa gara Dacheetti deebi’uu kan ibsu kami,"The correct answer is **B: Saatalaayitiiwwan** (Satellites).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Saatalaayitiin hawaarra jiru sun bilbila akkuma fuudheen hatattamaan gara lafaatti as deebisa."" This translates to ""The satellite in space sends the signal back to Earth like a radio wave.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Teleskoppiiwwan** (Telescopes) - Telescopes *receive* signals, they don't send them back to Earth.
*   **C: Ifa** (Light) - Light is part of the signal, but not the thing *doing* the sending.
*   **D: Rookkeettiwaan** (Rockets) - Rockets are used to *launch* satellites and telescopes, they don’t bring signals back.



"
Kanneen keessaa teleskoppii gara hawaatti erguuf kan gargaaru kami?,"The correct answer is **B: Rookkeettiwaan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hawaa irra saatalaayitii yookiin teeleskooppii kaa’uuf rookeetii guddaa fitii 100 ol dheeratu barbaachisa."" (To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a large rocket over 100 feet tall is needed.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bissii ifaa (Light beam):** While light is important for telescopes, it doesn't *launch* them.
* **C: Atimosferii lafaa (Earth's atmosphere):** The passage says the atmosphere *hinders* telescopes, it doesn't help launch them.
* **D: Saatalaayitiiwwan ijjata miilaa 100 lafarraa ol fagaatan (Satellites 100 miles above the earth):** These are the *result* of using a rocket, not the tool that gets them there.



"
Sa’aatin darbuu isaa baruuf waa’ee taatee marsaan deebi’uu (cyclical event) kamtu hubatamuu qaba?,"The correct answer is **B: Irra deddeebii**.

Here's why:

* **The passage directly discusses ""irra deddeebii marsaa"" (cyclical events) multiple times.** It explains how time is understood through these repeating patterns (""yeroo akka tartiiba taatewwanii fuuldurarraa amma keessa bahanii yeroo darbetti darbaniitti argina"") and how understanding these cycles helps us perceive our own experience of time (""Irradeddeebii marsaa taatee hubachuudhaan darbuu yeroo ofuma keetiin milikkiteeffachuu dandeessa""). The passage focuses on the repetition and return inherent in these cycles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Turtii (History):** While history is related to time, the passage isn't asking about understanding past events, but about the *nature* of time itself through recurring cycles.
* **C: Dhiibbaa (Effect/Impact):**  The passage mentions impacts but focuses on the cyclical *process* itself, not the outcomes.
* **D: Rakkisaa ta’uu (Difficulty):** The passage acknowledges time is difficult to grasp, but the question asks about the *thing* we need to understand to grasp it – the cyclical nature.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, taatee tokko maal isaa madaaluf yeroo ykn sa’aatii kan fayyadamnu?","The correct answer is **A: Dheerina (Duration)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yeroon akkasuma illee akkaataa itti hammamtaa (dheerina) taateewwanii itti wal madaalchisnudha.""  This translates to: ""Time also measures how long (duration) it is and compares it with others.""

The passage is discussing how we measure and understand time, and specifically mentions *dheerina* (duration/length) as the way we quantify it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Irra deddeebii (Repetition):** While the passage *mentions* repetition, it doesn't say we use it to *measure* time.
*   **C: Muuxannoo (Experience):** Experience is affected by time, but doesn't *measure* time itself.
*   **D: Dhiibbaa (Impact/Effect):**  Impact is a result of time passing, not a way to measure time.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states Charles *went* to university *instead* of following the traditional path of directly entering military service.  This is a deviation from the norm (""Akka aadaatti, dhaalaan teessoo aangoo erga barumsa fixee kallattumaan gara humna waraanaa deema"").  The other options are things he *did* while at university, not what set him apart from the traditional path.

*   **A: Digrii 2:2 argachuu** - This is a result of his university education, not the deviation itself.
*   **C: Seenaa qorachuu** - This is what he *studied* at university.
*   **D: Osoo waraanatti hin makamin dura yuunivarsiitii seenuuu** - While true, it's not the *contrast* being highlighted - it's that he *didn't* go to the military first.



"
"Odeeffannoo kuticha keessatti kenname irratti hundaa’un, Chaarlas maal gochuudhaf nama jalqabaa ture?","Correct answer is **C: Digrii argachuu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Chaarlis digirii fudhachuudhan miseensa Maatii Moototaa Biriitish keessa isa jalqabaa ture."" This directly translates to ""Charles was the first in the British Royal Family to receive a degree.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: osoo mana baruumsaa hin xumurin waraanatti makamuu** - The passage states he went to university *before* considering a military career.
*   **B: Arkiyoolojii qorachuu** - He *studied* archaeology, but wasn't the first royal to do that.
*   **D: Kolleejjii Tiriniititti barachuu** - He *attended* Trinity College, but wasn't the first royal to attend university in general."
Doonin Tiraayigvaasan (Trygvasson) biyya kam irraayi?,"The correct answer is **D: Noorweey**. 

The text states: ""Atiluun kun Olaaf Tiraayigivassooniin hogganame, nama **Norweeyii** kan biyya isaa to’annaa warra Deenmaark jalaa deebisee baasuuf abjuu qabuudha."" (This attack was led by Olaf Trygvasson, a **Norwegian** man eager to reclaim his homeland from the Danes.)"
Seenaa keessatti Jarman dhiibbaa aadaa cimaa Istooniyaa irratti kan geessiste yoomi?,"The correct answer is **A: Naannoo waggaa 200 dura**.

The text states ""Naannoo jarraa 15ffaatti..."" which translates to ""In the 15th century...""  The 15th century was roughly 200 years ago (counting from the 21st century).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B, C, and D:** These represent time periods much further back in history than the 15th century.

Afaan Istooniyaa maalidhaan dhiibban irra gahe?,"The correct answer is **B: qubee ykn alfaabeetii Jarmanii**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Qubee warra Jarmanii irratti kan hundaa’e ture, akkasumas arfiin """"Õ/õ"""" itti dabalamee ture."" This directly translates to ""It was based on the letters of the Germans, and the letter 'Õ/õ' was added to it."" 

While 'Õ/õ' is *a* feature, the foundation of the Estonian language was the German alphabet.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, lakkoofsi namoota Hindii jalqaba (native Hindi) dubbatanii kan daddaaqu sababa maalii irratti hundaa’eti?","Correct answer: **A: Loqodi Hindiitti baay’ee dhiyaatu lakkaa’amaa jira yoo ta’e**

**Explanation:**

The passage states that the number of Hindi speakers varies greatly due to the *counting of highly diverse dialects and including/excluding them*. This means the difference in estimated numbers stems from *how* people count the variations within the Hindi language itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Warri Urduu dubbatan lakkaa’amaa jiru yoo ta’e:** The passage mentions the similarity between Hindi and Urdu but doesn't say the count of Hindi speakers depends on who speaks Urdu.
*   **C: Namoonni afaanicha hubatan lakaa’amaa jiru yoo ta’e:** While the passage mentions people who *understand* Hindi, it says the variation in speaker numbers is due to dialects.
*   **D: Namoonni afaanicha dubbisan lakkaa’amaa jiru yoo ta’e:** This is too general. The specific reason for the variation isn't just about counting speakers, but about *which dialects* are included in that count.



"
Waa’ee afaan Hindii fi Urduu ilaalchisee himoota armaan gadii keessaa kamtu sirriidha?,"Correct answer is **B: Barreeffamaan garaa gari**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Afaan Hindii fi Urduun galmee jechootan walfakkaatoodha garuu barreeffamaan adda adda;"" which translates to ""Hindi and Urdu have similar vocabularies but different writing systems.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Namoota afaan lachuu dubbatan gidduu yeroo baay’ee walitti dhufeenyi hin jiru:** The passage says speakers of the two languages *can* understand each other in everyday conversation.
*   **C: Jechoota fi barreeffamaan lachuu wal fakkaatu:** The passage states the vocabularies are similar, but the *writing systems* are different.
*   **D: Jechaan gargari:** The passage says the vocabularies are *similar*, not different.

*   **The text states:** ""Sirni qubee sun 1444 keessa yeroo bulchiinsa Mootii Sejoong (1418-1450)’tti kalaqame. Mootin Seejoongii mootii afuraffaa Mootummaa Joosiyoon kan turee..."" (The alphabet was created in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450). King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty...)
*   Therefore, the alphabet was created by the fourth king of the **Joseon** Dynasty, not the Jaaseon Dynasty.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: Yeroo Mootii Sejong aangotti bahu gara jalqabaa uumame:** The text indicates it was created *during* King Sejong's reign.
*   **B: Maqaan jalqabaa qubichaa Hunan Jeongeum jedhama ture:** The text explicitly states its original name was Hunmin Jeongeum.
*   **D: Itti yaadamee uumame:** The text starts by stating it is a widely known and valuable alphabet, implying it was created with purpose and consideration.



"
Qubeen ykn alfaabeetin Hunan Jeongeum yeroon booda maalitti jijjiirame?,"The correct answer is **B: Hanguwel**.

The text states that Hangul (Hanguwel) is the name of the alphabet that was created and is the one widely known. It evolved *from* Hunmin Jeongeum, the original name given to it by King Sejong.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Seejong:** This is the name of the king who created the alphabet, not the alphabet's later name.
*   **C: Jasewon:** This word is not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Joengewum:** This word is not mentioned in the text.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, afaanota kamtu saanskiriitidhaan dhiibban irra gahe?","The correct answer is **D: Afaanota Indiyaa**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Saaniskiriitiin afaan baay’ee walxaxaa fi badhaadhaadha, kan afaanota Hindii ammayyaa baay’eef akka maddaatti tajaajile..."" This directly translates to ""Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language, serving as a source for many modern Indian languages...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Afaanota Laatiinii** - While the passage *compares* Sanskrit to Latin, it doesn't say Indian languages came from Latin.
*   **B: Afaanota Awurooppaa** - The passage mentions Latin as a source for European languages, but doesn't state Sanskrit's influence on them.
*   **C: Afaanota durii** - The passage states Sanskrit *is* an ancient language, but doesn't say other ancient languages originated from it.



"
"Akaataa kutichaatti, afaan Saanskiriit fayyadamuun kan bade sababa maalitiini?","Correct answer is **A: Wal-xaxaa ta’uusaa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Saaniskiriitiin afaan baay’ee walxaxaa fi badhaadhaadha, kan afaanota Hindii ammayyaa baay’eef akka maddaatti tajaajile..."" This directly explains that Sanskrit's richness and complexity made it a source for many modern Indian languages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Godaansa Ariyaan:** While the passage mentions the Aryan migration *related* to Sanskrit, it doesn’t state that this is why it was *used*. It’s about the origin, not the reason for its adoption.
* **C: Afaanota Laatiinii:** The passage draws a *comparison* between Sanskrit and Latin, but doesn't say Sanskrit was used *because* of Latin.
* **D: Caaseffama:** The passage doesn’t mention anything about ease of use. In fact, it implies it's quite complex (""baay’ee walxaxaa fi badhaadhaadha"").

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, harkisa lo irra jiru ilaalchisee kanneen armaan gadii keessaa himni sirriin kami?","The correct answer is **A: Harkisa lo caalaa harkisa lafaa ni xiqqata** (The force of the earth is smaller than the force of the cow).

Here's why:

The passage states that a person weighing 200 pounds on Earth weighs only 36 pounds on a cow. This clearly demonstrates that the force (harkisa) exerted by the cow is significantly less than the force of the Earth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Harkisni lo caalmatti harkisa, sababni ulfaatina xiqqaa qabaattus kanaafi** (The cow's force is greater because it has less weight) - This is backwards. Less weight means *less* force, not more.
* **C: Harakisni lo caalmatti ofitti harkisa, sababni ulfaatina guddaa qabaattus kanaafi** (The cow's force is greater because it has more weight) - This is also incorrect.  More weight doesn't translate to a greater force in this scenario; the cow's smaller mass results in less gravitational pull.
* **D: Harkisa lo caalaa harkisa lafaatu caalmatti ofitti si harkisa** (The earth's force is greater and pulls you more strongly) - While true in general (the Earth's gravity *is* stronger), the passage is specifically comparing the forces *within* the context of standing on a cow versus the Earth. The passage is demonstrating the *relative* difference in force.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, himoota armaan gadii keessaa kutaa Addeessaa gara alaa sirriitti kan ibsu kami?","Correct answer is **D: Bakka olka’aa jalatti maariyaa xiqqaatu jiraachuu mala**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""roga isa as dhiyaaturra lafti olka’aa diriiraan caalaan jiraachuu mala"" which translates to ""compared to the area around it, the land in higher areas is more likely to have less density"".  Less density is equivalent to a lower mass, which aligns with the idea of ""maariyaa xiqqaatu"" (less mass/material) in higher areas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Garri dhiyoo jiru dirra furdaa (thicker crust) qaba:** The passage doesn’t mention anything about the thickness of the crust.
*   **B: Dirri bakka olko’aa jalatti haphiidha:** The passage says the opposite - higher areas are *less* dense.
*   **C: Gara achi fagaatun maariyaa xiqqaatu jira ta’a:** The passage discusses density *with height*, not distance.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, dirri Addeessaa bakka kamitti furdaadha?","The correct answer is **C: Bakka olka’aa jala** (The place that is high and below).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bakkee ol ka’aa diriiraa jalatti haphii, garreen jalatti immoo furdaadha."" This translates to ""The cliff is high above the river, but the escape route is below it.""  Since Addeessaa's dirri (escape route) is associated with the cliff, it would be *below* the high point (olka'aa).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Karaa dhiyoo jiru:** (The existing narrow road) The passage doesn't mention a narrow road.
* **B: Bakka maariyaan baay’en jiru:** (The place with many Maria) This is irrelevant information in the passage.
* **D: Maariyaa jala:** (Under Maria) This is also irrelevant.

Wiirtuu ifaarraa hamma fagaataa deemtu maaltu haphataa deema?,"The correct answer is **C: Gaazii**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gaaziin akkuma giddugala aduu irraa fagaataa deemtaniin qal’ataa deema."" which translates to ""As gas moves away from the center of the Earth, it cools down.""

The question asks what gets thinner as you move away from the Earth. The passage specifically says gas cools and therefore gets less dense as it moves further away.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, qaama aduu kam lafarra dhaabatanii mul’ata?","The correct answer is **C: Footoosfiirii**.

The passage states: ""Qaamni bakkee kan gaafa Aduu ilaalu nuti arginu footosfeer jedhamu, “kubbaa ifaa” jechuu dha."" This directly translates to ""The outer layer seen when looking at Earth is called the photosphere, meaning 'sphere of light'.""

Therefore, the photosphere is the layer of the Earth that appears to stand out on the surface.

Ilaalcha armaan gadii keessaa tiyoorii Kopparnikas kan deegaruuf kan gargaaru kami?,"Correct answer is **A: Gulantaalee Veenasii** (Phases of Venus).

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Marsaaleen kan uumaman sababa gartokkeen Veenus (ykn kan Addeessaa) inni gara aduutti gara galee jiru qofatti ifti itti baheefidha."" This means the phases of Venus (seeing it as a crescent, gibbous, etc., like the Moon) could *only* be explained if Venus orbits the Sun, not the Earth.  This is because different amounts of the illuminated side of Venus would be visible from Earth as it orbits the Sun.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tiraaniziitii Veenasii (Transits of Venus):** While transits of Venus are important astronomical events, the passage doesn't mention them being crucial to supporting the Copernican theory *at this time*.
*   **C: Wal-fakkeenya Aduu Veenasii waliin (Similarities between Earth and Venus):** The passage focuses on Venus's *orbit*, not its similarities to Earth.
*   **D: Wal-fakkeenya Aduu Addeessa waliin (Similarities between Earth and Mars):** Mars is mentioned as relating to the *appearance* of Venus’ phases, but the phases of Venus themselves are the key evidence.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa bara 1610 tti Galiiliyoo Galiiledhaan kan argame kami?,"Correct answer is **B: Gulantaalee Veenasii**

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Waggoota kumaa sadii boode, 1610 keessa, Astiroonomariin Xaaliyanii Galiliyoo Galilee Teleeskopii fayyadamuun Veenuusiin ilaale akka ishee kutaawwan qabdu beekuuf, akkuma Jinni qabdu."" This translates to: ""In 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, using a telescope, observed Venus and discovered it had phases, like the moon.""  Phases of Venus are what reveal its surface features (and therefore, that it orbits the sun, supporting the Copernican theory). ""Kutaawwan"" means phases.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cinaa Addeessaa kan Aduutti aanu:** The text mentions Mars phases, not Venus phases in 1610.
*   **C: Pilaanetittiin Adduutti naanna’uu ishee:** While Venus does orbit the sun, the text focuses on the *discovery* of its phases, not just its orbit.
*   **D: Tiraaniziitii Veenasii:** Transit of Venus was observed later, in 1639 by Horrocks, not by Galileo in 1610.

The passage states: ""Innis bishaan lageen xixxiqqoo baayee irraa walitti qabun fudhata."" which translates to ""It collects water from many small streams."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Laga dheeraa (Long rivers):** While the Amazon eventually connects to other rivers, the passage specifically highlights small streams as its primary source.
* **C: Galaanota (Lakes):** The passage doesn't mention lakes as a primary source of the Amazon's water.
* **D: Laga guddinaan lammaffaa ta’e (The second largest river):** This describes the Amazon itself, not where it *gets* its water from.



"
Beekamtii kamtu Amaazon hin ilaallanne?,"The correct answer is **C: Laga dheerinaan tokkoffaadha** (It is the longest river).

Here's why:

The passage states Amaazon is the *second* longest river in the world (""Lagni Amaazoon addunyaa irratti dheerinaan lammaffaa"").  Therefore, it is *not* the longest river.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Laga dheerinaan lammaffaa ta’eedha** (It is the second longest river) - This *is* stated in the passage.
*   **B: Laga guddicha** (It is a large river) - The passage says it's a large river (""laga guddaa ta’uun beekama"").
*   **D: Laga bal’inaan tokkooffaadha** (It is the widest river) - The passage states it’s a wide river (""lagan ballicha lafa"").

The passage states: ""Veenzuweelonni harki lama sadaffaaan kan sektara tajaajilaa keessa hojjetan, nuusa kan ta’an indastrii keessa akkasumas shanaffaan qonna irra hojjetu."" 

This translates to: ""Venezuelans, two-thirds work in the service sector, a third in industry, and a fifth in agriculture.""

A fifth (1/5) is the smallest proportion mentioned, meaning the fewest Venezuelans work in agriculture. Therefore, agriculture is the sector with the smallest number of Venezuelan workers."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, seektaroota hojii armaan gadii keessaa lammiilee Venezuweelaa lakkoofsa guddaa kan qacaru kami?","Correct answer: **B: Qonna**

The passage states: ""Veenzuweelonni harki lama sadaffaaan kan sektara tajaajilaa keessa hojjetan, nuusa kan ta’an indastrii keessa akkasumas shanaffaan qonna irra hojjetu."" This translates to ""Venezuelans, a third work in the service sector, a small portion in industry, and *five* work on farms.""  

Therefore, agriculture (qonna) employs the largest number of Venezuelans among the options listed."

The passage states the process involves ""sababa huumna atoomiin haaydirojiinii elementoota ulfaatoo uumuuf walitti makamaniifi (yookiin fiyuzii ta’aanii walitti qabamaniifi)."" This directly translates to ""causing the power of hydrogen atoms to combine to form heavier elements (or to fuse together).""  Therefore, hydrogen is the key element involved in the beneficial fusion process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Urjiiwwan (Energies)** - While fusion *releases* energy, energy isn’t what’s being fused *to create* something beneficial.
*   **C: Atamiiwwan (Atoms)** - Atoms generally are involved in fusion, but the question asks for the element that initiates a *beneficial* fusion.
*   **D: Anniisaa (Electrons)** - Electrons are part of atoms, but they aren’t the primary component involved in the fusion process described."
Bishaan keemikaala maalirraa uumama?,"The correct answer is **D: Atamii hayidiroojiinii lamaa fi atamii oksijiinii tokko**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kompaawundiin bishaan irraa hojjatame atomiiwwan haayidiroojiinii lamaa fi atomii ooksijiinii tokkodha."" which translates to ""The compound water is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom."""
"Bishaan yommuu foormii isaa jijjiiru, osoo hin jijjiiramin kan hafu maalidha?","Correct answer is **A: Caasaa molokiyuulii**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Yooma haalli fiizikaalawaan isaa jijjiirame iyyuu, haalli keemikaalawaan isaa immoo akkuma duraaniitti ta’a. Caasaa moleekiyuularraa wal fakkata qaba yoo gaasiis, dhangala’aas, ykn jajjaboo ta’eeyyu."" This means that even when water changes its physical form (gas, liquid, solid), its molecular structure remains the same.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Rukkina:** This isn't discussed in the text.
*   **C: Sadarkaa fiizikaalaa:** The text states the physical state *changes*, so it's not what remains constant.
*   **D: Naayitiroojiinii dhangala’aa:** This is an example used to show how elements are constant, but it doesn't relate to what stays the same with water."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, naannolee kudha sadi keessatti seerota tokko tokko hojiirra oolchuf yaalamu kanneen armaan gadii keessaa rakkoo kan hin turre kami?","Correct answer: **A: Angawoota naannoo irraa to’annaa cimaa**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hogantoota naannoo, yeroo baay'ee kan hin gargaarre, iratti kan hirkatee dha, gocha isaa hojiirra oolchuuf."" This means local leaders *were* actively resisting and interfering with the implementation of laws.  Therefore, strong opposition from local authorities wouldn't be a *problem* with implementing laws, it *was* the implementation itself being problematic due to that opposition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hanqina aangoo kongiresii keessatti (Lack of Congressional power):** The passage explicitly states Congress lacked the authority to act effectively.
* **C: Tumaawwan seeraa sagalee guutun ragga’uu gaafatan (Laws requiring unanimous consent):** While not directly stated, the passage implies difficulty in getting agreement and enforcement.
* **D: Hoji raawwachiiftuu biyyoolessaa kan hin jirre (Lack of federal enforcement):** The passage states the federal government had no mechanism to enforce laws directly.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, yeroo Waraana Warraaqsaa sadarkaa mootummaa giduu galeessaa himni sirriitti ibsu kami?","The correct answer is **D: Mootummaan giduu galeessaa wantoota of keessati qabate.**

Here's why:

* **The passage details the limitations and internal conflicts of the central government (mootummaa giddugaleessaa) during the Civil War.** It highlights its inability to effectively enforce laws, the disloyalty of local officials, and the lack of authority over inter-state commerce.  Essentially, the passage is describing the *problems within* the central government.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gibirri Kongiresii fi aangawootan akka hojiirra oolu godhame** - The passage explicitly states the central government *lacked* the power to effectively implement laws (including tax laws).
* **B: Keewwatoota irratti jijjiirama gochuun aangoo Kongiresii irratti hirkata ture** - The passage doesn't focus on changes to the constitution or a reduction in Congressional power.
* **C: Bakka bu’oonni naannolee bakka bu’ummaa hin qaban ture** - While the passage mentions replacements for officials, it emphasizes their ineffectiveness and the harm they caused, not that they lacked the *right* to be replacements.



Therefore, option D most accurately summarizes the central theme of the passage: the inherent weaknesses and internal issues plaguing the central government during the Civil War."
Jechoonni dugda Labsa Walabummaa (Declaration of Independence) irratti akkamitti barreeffaman?,"The correct answer is **C: Gadi garagalee**.

The passage states: ""Barreeffamichi kan argamu jalee sanadichaa irratti gadi galagaleeti."" This translates to ""The writing was found descending (or scattered) on the leaf of the document."" This indicates the writing wasn't neatly arranged but rather appeared in a dispersed or *gadi garagalee* manner. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gurguddatee (Boldly/Clearly):** The passage doesn't mention the writing being bold or clear.
* **B: Koodidhaan (In code):** The passage doesn't suggest the writing was encrypted.
* **D: Xixiqqatee (Small/Tiny):** The passage highlights the document's large size, implying the writing wasn't small.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa Singaappor maalin beekamti?,"Correct answer is **D: Agarsiisa aartii** (Art exhibitions).

**Explanation:**

The text states that the Mooraa Biqiltootaa Singaapoor (Singapore Botanical Gardens) is being transformed into a Magaalaa Biqiltuu tirooppikaalaatti (tropical city) and mentions Vaandaa Miis Johaakiim, an orchid named after a local businessman, being chosen as the national flower.  This highlights Singapore's focus on beautiful gardens and unique floral displays, which fall under the category of *artistic exhibitions* or displays. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Magaala magariisa** (Metropolitan city) - While Singapore *is* a metropolitan city, the text doesn't focus on that aspect.
*   **B: Tulluu koruu** (High mountains) - Singapore is relatively flat, not known for mountains.
*   **C: Ispoortii adveencharii** (Adventure sports) - The text doesn’t mention anything about adventure sports."
Vaandaa Miis Joakum maalidha?,"The correct answer is **B: Abaaboo**.

The text states: ""Vaandaa Miis Johaakiim kan jedhamu, kan makaa abaaboo Orkiid ta’e, akka abaaboo biyyaalessa biyyattiitti filame."" This directly translates to ""Vaandaa Miis Johaakiim, who is a species of Orchid, was chosen as a national flower.""

Therefore, Vaandaa Miis Johaakiim is an **abaaboo** (flower/species)."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, qulqullina (quality) piraamidiiwwan Giizaa keessaa Mootummaa Masirii Haaradhaan kan hin ajaa’ibsiifatamne maalidha?","Correct answer: **D: Ijaarsa isaanii**

Here's why:

The passage states that even the new Egyptian government was amazed by the *construction* (ijaarsa) of the pyramids, noting they surpassed anything that came after, even after thousands of years. This directly relates to the quality of the construction itself - the skill and technique used.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bara isaanii (Their age)** - While their age is impressive, the passage focuses on how they were *built*, not just how long ago they were built.
*   **B: Itti fayyadama dhagaa (Use of stone)** - The passage doesn't say anything about the material being unique.
*   **C: Guddina isaanii (Their size)** - The passage states their size and grandness were unmatched, but the focus of the amazement is *how* they achieved that size, i.e., the construction method.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, bineensonni biqiloota sooratan rooba barbaacha eessaa dhufu?","The correct answer is **A: Lafa olka’oo lixaa** (Northern Highlands).

Here's why:

The text states the wildebeest migrate *from* the northern highlands *to* the southern plains due to the rains of the Mara River, then back north again after the rains in the Ebliati area, again crossing the Mara River.  This clearly indicates the rains originate in the northern highlands.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gaarren kaabaa** (Northern Hills) - While they *go to* the northern hills, the rain doesn't come *from* them initially.
* **C: Lafa olka’oo kibbaa** (Southern Highlands) - The wildebeest migrate *to* the southern plains, not *from* them.
* **D: Gaarren lixaa** (Southern Hills) - Same reasoning as C.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, bineensonni biqiloota sooratan yeroo tokko tokko naannoo ji’a Eblaa naannoo kamii ka’u?","The correct answer is **A: Naaannoo Sarangeetii** (Serengeti Region).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bineensonni biqiloota sooratan yeroo tokko tokko naannoo ji’a Eblaa naannoo kamii ka’u? ... Naannoon Serengetii paarkii biyyaalessaa Serengeti qaba..."" This directly links the wildebeest migration to the Serengeti region *after* the rains in Eblaati (Ebla).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Lafa olka’oo kibbaa** (Southern Highlands) - While the migration *moves towards* the southern highlands, it doesn't *stay* in that region after Ebla.
*   **C: Laga Maaraa** (Mara River) - The Mara River is a crossing point *during* the migration, not a final destination after the Ebla rains.
*   **D: Iddoo Kunuunsa Biyyaalessaa Maasayi Maaraa** (Maasai Mara National Reserve) - Similar to the Mara River, this is a location *within* the migration route, not the primary area they go to after Ebla.



"
Opireeshin Siilaayin kan jedhamu weerara biyya kamiiti?,"The correct answer is **B: Biriteen**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Jarmaniin haleellaa sana maqaa koodii “Haleellaa Siilaayen” jedhu itti moggaafte"" (Germany named the operation ""Operation Sea Lion"").  It then goes on to describe Germany preparing to *attack* Britain (""Jarmaniin odola Biriiteen weeraruuf qophaa’uu eegalte""). Operation Sea Lion was the planned German invasion of Britain.



"
Jarman haleellaa Biriteen irratti raawwate maal jettee waamti?,"The correct answer is **B: Opiireeshin Siilaayin**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Jarmaniin haleellaa sana maqaa koodii “Haleellaa Siilaayen” jedhu itti moggaafte."" (Germany named that attack with the code name ""Operation Sealion"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dankirk** - Dankirk is mentioned as a place where British forces retreated *from*, not the name of the German attack.
*   **C: Kiriigsmaarin** - This is the German Navy (""Kriegsmarine""), and while strong, it's not the name of the operation.
*   **D: Rooyaal Neevii** - This is the Royal Navy (British), not related to the German attack name.



"
Karoora Xaaliyaanin biyyoota Afrikaa qabachuuf baafatte keessatti kan hin eeramin maalidha?,"Correct answer is **A: Dooniwwan Masirii keessa jiran dhiisuu**

Here's why:

The passage states Xaaliyaanii needs to prevent British ships from reaching Egypt (Masir) to control the Mediterranean Sea and invade Africa. It does *not* mention any plan to specifically dismantle or eliminate ships *within* Egypt's ports. The focus is on stopping them from *arriving*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Markaboota haaraa ijaaruu:** The passage explicitly says Xaaliyaanii planned to build four new ships.
*   **C: Paadii ittiin loltuu ergan hundeessuu:** The passage mentions establishing bases for submarines.
*   **D: Buufataalee Biritiish barbadeessuu:** The passage states Xaaliyaanii wants British ships to be kept away from Egypt, effectively disrupting British facilities/ports there.

Weerartoota waliin hariiroo hiriyummaa kan tolfate eenyudha?,"The correct answer is **B: Viichii Firansaay**.

Here's why:

The passage states: “’Viishii’ Faransaayiin bulchamee ture. Warri kun namoota Faransaayii warra 1940 keessa Jarmanoota wajjin nagaa buusanii fi weerartoota loluu irra iddoo isaa kan wajjin hojjetanidha.” This directly translates to ""‘Viishii’ was ruled by France. These were French people in 1940 who made peace with the Germans and cooperated with the invaders."" 

Therefore, Viichii Firansaay (Vichy France) collaborated with the invaders (the Germans).



"
Oppireeshinii Diraagon keessatti humnoonni Waloo hirmaatan eenyu turan?,"The correct answer is **A: Ameerikaanotaa fi Faraansaayi Bilisaa** (Americans and Free French).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Torban lama qofa keessatti Amerikaanonnii fi humnoonni Faransaayii Walabaa Faransaay kibbaa bilisa baasanii gara Jermanitti naanna’aa turan.""  ""Humnoonni Faransaayii Walabaa"" translates to ""Free French forces"". 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Viichii Faransaayi fi Ameerikaanota** - While the Vichy French were mentioned, they were the collaborators, *not* part of the liberating force in Operation Dragon.
*   **C: Warra Jarmanoota fi Faransaayi** - The Germans were the enemy, not participants in liberating southern France.
*   **D: Ameerikaanotaa fi warra Jarmanootaa** -  This is incorrect; Americans and Germans were fighting *against* each other.



"
Gabbisa teeknolojii kamtu dooniwwan galaana jala deemuu akka jalqabaniif sababa ta’e?,"Correct answer: **D: Raadaarii**

Here's why:

The text states that submarines initially frequently surfaced during WWI, but *when radar became available and very accurate*, they were forced to stay submerged to avoid detection. This directly links the development of radar technology to the shift in submarine tactics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bidiruuwwan boca U** – U-boats were *types* of submarines, not a technology that caused them to submerge.
*   **B: Reenjii dhukaasaa** - While range was a factor, the text doesn't say it *caused* the change to staying submerged.
*   **C: Naavigeeshinii ykn barbaacha** - Navigation is important, but not the technology that prompted the shift to underwater operation due to detection concerns.



"
"Yeroo sadarkaa jalqabaa isaanii, dooniwwan galaana jala deeman maal irratti reenjii murtaa’a qabu turan?","The correct answer is **C: Dhukaasuu** (Endurance).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yeroo sanitti baay’ee suuta kan jedhaniifi **fageenyi isaan itti dhukaasanis murtaawaa ture.**"" This translates to ""At that time, they were very primitive and **the distance they could endure was limited.**"" 

The passage highlights that the early submarines were limited by how long they could stay underwater, which is directly related to their endurance or ability to *dhukaasuu*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Naavigeeshinii** (Navigation) - While important, the passage doesn't emphasize navigation as the primary limiting factor.
*   **B: Deemsa** (Speed) - Speed isn't mentioned as a crucial constraint in the early stages.
*   **D: Hojjachuu** (Operation/Functioning) - The passage mentions Germany's skill in operating them, but not that operation itself was a limiting factor for the submarines themselves.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, eenyutu waliigaltee cabse? ","Correct answer: **D: Warra Sooviyeetii**

**Explanation:**

The passage states that 800,000 soldiers of the **Soviet Red Army** invaded after agreements were made between Poland and the Soviet Union (specifically the Non-Aggression Pact and the Mutual Assistance Agreement).  Therefore, the Soviets are the ones who carried out the invasion implied by the agreements.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Poolish** - Poland was invaded, not the invader.
*   **B: Warra Romaaniyaa** - Romania is mentioned as a place where someone returned, but not as an aggressor in this context.
*   **C: Warra Yukireen** - Ukraine is mentioned as a territory where fighting occurred, but the invasion was carried out *into* Ukraine, not *by* Ukrainians."
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa Red Armii dhaan kan hin raawwatamne kami?,"Correct answer is **A: Uumamuu adda waraanaa Yukireen**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Red Army *created* the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts (addaa waraanaa Beelaaruusiyaa fi Yuukireeyin). This means they were responsible for their formation, not that it was something they *didn't* do.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Weerara naannolee bahaa:** The passage explicitly states the Red Army ""attacked territories east of Poland"" (weeraranii naannoowwan bahaa Poolaandii).
*   **C: Naannoo riqicha sanaatti deebi’anii gurmaa’uu:** The passage mentions soldiers retreating *to* Romania to regroup, implying they were actively reorganizing.
*   **D: Walii galtee cabsuu:** The passage states that the Red Army operated after breaking multiple agreements (Waliigaltee Nagaa Riigaa, Waliigaltee Weerara-Hambisuu Sooviyetiifi Poolaandi, etc.), meaning they *broke* agreements.



"
Injinara Olaanaa Humna Waranaa Kurnaffaa Xaaliyaanii maaltu isa mudate?,"The correct answer is **C: Warra Biritishiin to’atame**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Riphanii loluu dhiha Baardiyaatiin, warri Ingilizii Hoogganaa Injinerootaa Loltoota Xaaliyaanii Kurnaffaa, Jeneraal Laatuuchii qabatan."" This translates to ""After pursuing them into Bardia, the British captured the commander of the Italian engineers, General Latouchi.""

Therefore, the high-ranking Italian military engineer was captured by the British.
"
Itaaloo Balboo eessatti ajjeefame?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobruuk**.

The text states: ""Gaafa Waxabajji 28, Maarshaal Italo Balbo... kan du’an dhuukasa hiriyyummaan utuu Tobruki keessa qubachuuf jedhanii."" This translates to ""On August 28, Marshal Italo Balbo... died while attempting to land in Tobruk."" 

Therefore, Italo Balbo died in Tobruk."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa maloota Tibeetan Mediteeshinii barbaachisaa kan ta’e kami?","Correct answer: **C: Waaqolii fakkii sammuun ilaaluu**

**Explanation:**

The passage states that Tibetan meditation centers around ""Yoga of the Deity"" (Yoogaa Waaqaati). It explains that through this practice, practitioners visualize deities, which helps to clear energy channels, activate chakras, and develop a clear mind. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hafuura baafachuu shaakaluu (Controlling breath)** - While breathing exercises (pranayama) are *part* of yoga in general, the passage specifically highlights the visualization of deities as the core of Tibetan meditation.
*   **B: Jecha tokko irra deddeebin jechuu (Repeating a single word/mantra)** - This is a common practice in some Buddhist traditions, but isn’t the central focus of Tibetan meditation as described in the text.
*   **D: Haala teessuma yoogaa sirriitti beekuu (Knowing yoga postures well)** - The passage mentions Kundalini yoga and physical postures as related to Tibetan Buddhism but doesn’t state that knowing poses is the central aspect of the meditation itself.

Therefore, the answer is **C** because the text explicitly describes the visualization of deities as the foundational element of Tibetan meditation."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, yeroo “giddu galeessa” Tibeetan Mediteeshiniitti chaakras akkamitti akka hojjatu ykn dammaqu godhama?","Correct answer: **B: Waaqolii fakkii sammuun ilaaluun**

Here's why:

The text states that Tibetan meditation centers around ""Yoogaa Waaqaati"" (Yoga of Deity). This means visualizing deities (waaqolii fakkii) is a core practice. The passage further explains this visualization *illuminates pathways of energy, chakras are activated, and a clear consciousness is created*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Karaa haala teessuma yoohaa hedduun** - While posture is important in meditation generally, the passage doesn't emphasize specific postures as the *method* of chakra activation.
*   **C: Jechi tokko irra deddeebi’amuu** -  Repeating a mantra is a common meditation technique, but isn't what the text specifically describes as happening within the ""giddu galeessa"" of Tibetan meditation.
*   **D: Hafuura baafachuu shaakaluu** -  Breath control is also a common meditation technique, but again, the text links chakra activation to deity visualization, not specifically breath control.



"
Yeroo sagantaa faarsaa ykn weedduu waaqeffannaa lammaffaa eenyutu dhiyeesse?,"The correct answer is **A: Saanjuu Shaarmaa**.

The text states: ""Sirbituun Saanju Sharmaan galgalicha eegale..."" which translates to ""The service by Sanju Sharma began the ceremony..."" This indicates Sanju Sharma initiated the second part of the ceremony (the *galgalicha*)."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, yeroo kennaa nyaataa eenyutu faarsaa ykn weedduu waaqeffannaa dhiyeesse?","The correct answer is **A: Laakha Singh**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dhiyeessi gabatee 108 kan Chhappan Bhog kunneen Baba Shyam'f dhiyaataa ture. Laakkaa Sinyaan akkasuma chaappaan boogii baajaan ibsee."" This translates to ""The offering of 108 plates of Chhappan Bhog was for Baba Shyam. Laakha Singh also presented the Chhappaan Bhog offering.""

Therefore, Laakha Singh was the one who presented the offering."
Sagantaan lammataa fi kan dhumaa galgalaa maal ture?,"The correct answer is **B: Abidda Anatooliyaa**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Xumuruudhaaf, gareen shubbisa Faayir oof Anatooliyaa agarsiisa """"Tirooy"""" irratti hojjate."" This translates to ""Finally, the fire-breathing group of Anatolia worked on the 'Tirooy' show.""  This is the last event mentioned in the paragraph.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Seezen Aksuu, Aleesaandiroo Safiinaa fi Haaris Aleeksiyo** - These are individual performers, not the final act.
*   **C: Wirling Dervishis** - This happened earlier in the sequence of events.
*   **D: Faatih Erkook fi Muslum Garses** - They appeared earlier in the show as musicians.



"
Aleesaandiroo Safiinaa biyyi isaa eessa?,"The correct answer is **D: Nama Xaaliyaanii** (Italian).

The text states: ""weellisaa Xaaliyaanii Alessaandiroo Saafiinaa"" which directly translates to ""Italian performer Alessandro Safina"". Therefore, Alessandro Safina is from Italy."
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’un, himoota armaan gadii keessaa kamtu dhugaadha?","Correct answer is **A: Saantaa Kilaaraa keessa abidatu ture**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states:** ""Guyyichi baayee ho’aa ture Saanta Kilaaraa kana keessatti ho’a qilleensa naannoo 90 oota keessaa qabaachuudhaan."" This translates to ""It was a very hot day in Santa Clara with heat indices around 90 degrees."" This confirms an accident happened *in* Santa Clara.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Namoonni roolar koostarii irratti danqamanii turan** - The passage says people were *unable* to stay on the roller coaster for long due to the heat, not that they were falling off.
*   **C: Imaltootaf bishaan kennamee ture** - The first sentence mentions being able to pour water on the metal, but does *not* state that it *was* done.
*   **D: Nama jalqabaa konkolaaticharraa buusuf yoo xiqqaate daqiiqaa 60 fudhate** - The passage states it took at least *an hour* (sa'atii tokko) to get the first person off, not 60 minutes.



"
"Akkataa kutichaatti, sadarkaa hoo’aa namatti hin tolle ilaalchisee eenyutu yaada kenne?","Correct answer: **A: Opiiretarii konkolaatichaa**

Here's why:

The passage states the roller coaster operator said, ""It was a very hot day in Santa Clara, with temperatures around 90 degrees. It wasn't possible to stay on the roller coaster for as long as you wanted, and even if you dismounted at the bottom, it took at least an hour to get the first person off the ride.""

This directly links the statement about the heat and its impact on ride operation to the **roller coaster operator**.  The other options are not mentioned as the source of this information in the text."
Sababa sunaamutiin ibsaan eessatti badee ture?,"The correct answer is **A: Toongaa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""humni ibsaa yeroof badee ture, kun immoo itti gaafatamtootni Toongaa akeekachiisa Suunamii PTWC dhaan darbu akka hin fudhanne taasise."" This directly translates to ""the warning system was issued, and this caused officials in Tonga to not take the PTWC tsunami warning seriously."" Therefore, the warning was issued *because* of the tsunami event originating in Tonga.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Niyuwee:** While Niue received tsunami waves, the source of the tsunami and the initial warning weren't from Niue.
* **C: Manneen barnootaa Hawaayi keessa jiran:** The schools in Hawaii *received* warnings, they didn't cause the warning to be issued.
* **D: Paagoo Paagoo:**  Paagoo Paagoo was where tsunami waves were recorded, but not the source of the tsunami that triggered the warning.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Poolisotni Niw Zilaand radarii ariitii fiigicha fayyadamuu irratti rakkoo qabuu turani saffisaa itti Obbo Reyiid deema jiran beekuf sababa gadi xiqqeenya Baredduu gurraacha, **fi yeroon tokkichi Poolisiin Obbo Reyiidin ilaalu itti danda’ee gaafa inni gara 160km/h gadi buuse dha.**"" 

This translates to: ""The New Zealand police were having trouble using radar speed cameras to track Mr. Reyid's speed, and the one time the police were able to observe Mr. Reyid was **when he was going down from 160km/h**.""

Therefore, they used the speed measuring device when he was driving at 160km/h.

The text states the police had trouble with the radar speed gun because Joonii Raayid was driving *at* 160km/h. They were able to get a reading when he slowed down to that speed. The issue wasn't how *little* he was driving (B), how many laps (C), or the road conditions (D), but the sheer speed initially. 

The text directly links the police's difficulty with the radar gun to the speed of 160km/h."
Lafa qaramee ol ka’e (butte) dhaan wal-qabatee kirkirri lafaa bu’uurri isaa eessa ture?,"The correct answer is **B: Gara kibbaatti maayilii 40**.

Here's why:

Since the question asks about the distance to a butte (lafa qaramee ol ka’e), and the text specifically mentions South Butte being 40 miles away, that's the correct answer."
Yeroo hokkorri Abu Gahraibittu ka’e maaltu ta’e?,"Correct answer is **A: Miidhaa nama mana hidhaa jururra gahu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Manni hidhaa Abuu Gaharaayibii *hidhichaa ergaa humni waraanaa US fudhatee hidhaamtootni mirgii isaani sarbamuun argameen booda baayee jibbisasaa ta’e*. This directly relates to the abuse and mistreatment of prisoners within the Abu Ghraib prison.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sochii daangeffamuu** - While investigations *did* happen, the passage focuses on the *result* of the investigations (prisoners being released after rights violations) and the subsequent outrage.
*   **C: Waraanni US to’achuu itti fufe** -  The passage doesn't mention any continuation of US military action related to the prison.
*   **D: Mana hidhaatti abiddi qabsiifame** - The passage focuses on the abuses *within* the prison, not the imprisonment itself.



"
Manni hidhaa Iraaq maalif beekame? ,"Correct answer: **D: Miidhaa nama mana hidhaa jururra gahu bira gahamuu**

Here's why:

*   The text states Manni hidhaa Abuu Gaharaayibii became notorious *because* of the abuse and torture inflicted on prisoners by US forces. This aligns directly with option D, which describes the severe harm caused to those imprisoned there.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Abiddi itti qabsiifame** - While people *were* detained, the reason for the notoriety wasn't simply the act of imprisonment itself.
*   **B: Waraanni US ni to’ate** - The US military was involved, but the problem wasn't just their presence, but their actions within the prison.
*   **C: Hokkora heddutu ture** - While there may have been many prisoners, that doesn't explain why the prison became infamous.

The core issue and reason for Manni hidhaa Abuu Gaharaayibii’s infamy was the horrific abuse of prisoners."
Isteediyeemii Yaadannoo Waraana Maa’uwi tti( Maui's War Memorial Stadium) sagantaalee akkamitu gaggeeffama ture?,"The correct answer is **A: Agarsiisa maajikii** (Magic show).

The text states ""Baandichi agarsiisa isaa Istaadoomii Yaadannoo Waraana Maawuuyiittii..."" which translates to ""The band held its show at the Maui War Memorial Stadium..."".  This directly indicates a performance, specifically a magic show based on the context.

The other options aren't mentioned in the text."
Sagantichi haqamuu ilaalchisee eenyutu ibsa kenne?,"The correct answer is **B: Manajimentii kampaanichaa**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Kaampaaniin bulchiinsa baandichaa, HK Management Inc... Fulbaana 20 yeroo haqanitti sababa jalqabaa hin keennine, garuu guyyaa ittii aanutti sababoota loojistiikii komataniiru."" This directly translates to ""The management company of the band, HK Management Inc... didn't give a first reason for the 20th cancellation, but complained about logistical reasons the following day.""

Therefore, it was the **management of the band** who gave the statement regarding the cancellation.



"
Hanna gaggeeffame ilaalchisee jiraattonni Bishkeek heddu eentutu itti gaafatama jedhanii yaadu?,"Correct Answer: **C: Mormitoota**

**Explanation:**

The text states: ""Jiraattonni Bishkeeki heeddun al-seerummaa jiruuf mormitoota kibbaa dhufan komatu."" This directly translates to ""Many residents of Bishkek complain about the existing lawlessness and the southerners (mormitoota) who come with it.""

Therefore, the residents of Bishkek blame the southerners (mormitoota) for the problems related to the lack of law enforcement."
Hannaaf eenyutu mormitoota kibbarraa dhufan komate?,"The correct answer is **A: Jiraattota Bishkeek** (Residents of Bishkek).

The text states: ""Jiraattonni Bishkeeki heeddun al-seerummaa jiruuf mormitoota kibbaa dhufan komatu."" This directly translates to ""Many residents of Bishkek complain about the existing lawlessness and the southerners who protest.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hoggantoota humna nageenyaa** (Security force leaders) - The text doesn't mention security force leaders complaining.
* **C: Warra hokkara uuman** (Those who create chaos) - These are the perpetrators of the problems, not those complaining about them.
* **D: Gaagistaroota** (Criminals) - Similar to C, they are part of the problem, not the complainants.



"
Kampaanin Ring gurgurtaansaa kan dabaale yoom?,"Correct answer: **A: Erga shaark Taank mul’atee**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Siminoof akka jedhutti erga inni 2013 kutaa fiilmii Taankii Shaark iddoo itti beeksisni agarsiisichaa deggersa jalqabsiisuu kuffise’en booda gurgurtaan baayyee dabale jedhe.""  This translates to ""According to Siminoff, the buzz increased significantly after he finished appearing on Shark Tank in 2013."""
Jeemii Siminof kampaanii Ring kan eegale yoomi?,"Correct Answer: **B: Shark Tank mul’achuu erga dhaabee booda**

**Explanation:**

The passage states: ""Siminoof akka jedhutti erga inni 2013 kutaa fiilmii Taankii Shaark iddoo itti beeksisni agarsiisichaa deggersa jalqabsiisuu kuffise’en booda gurgurtaan baayyee dabale jedhe."" This translates to ""According to Siminoff, after he finished filming the Shark Tank episode in 2013, the excitement increased a lot."" 

This clearly indicates that his company, Ring, gained significant momentum *after* his appearance on Shark Tank. While he started working on the idea before, the real growth and recognition came afterward.
"
Tokkoon tokkoo Reading Rainbow ijoolledhaaf waan ta’uu qabu maal dhiyeesse?,"The correct answer is **D: Kitaabota (Books)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that each episode of Reading Rainbow is based on a specific children's book and then explores that book in various ways. Furthermore, the show *encouraged* children to choose books when they went to the library. The whole purpose of the show was to promote reading and expose kids to different books.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Agarsiisa televizhiinii (Television show):** While *Reading Rainbow* *was* a television show, the question asks what it provided *to* children, not what it *is*.
*   **B: Laabrariiwwan naannoo (Local libraries):** The show *sent* kids to libraries, but didn't directly *give* them libraries.
*   **C: Egaawwan (Awards):** The passage doesn't mention any awards.



"
Sagantaalee walitti fufiinsaa Reading Rainbow akka haqamu maaltu sababa ta’e laata?,"The correct answer is **A: Fandii gahaa dhabuu**.

Here's why:

The passage states that *Reading Rainbow* had over 200 Emmy awards but its funding ""rested solely on Sesame Street and Mister Rogers' Neighborhood."" This implies that when funding for those parent shows (and therefore, *Reading Rainbow*) was cut, the show was affected. While the passage doesn't explicitly say this *caused* the show to end, it's the strongest indication of a reason for the show's decline.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hanqina badhaasa Emmy:** The show *had* many Emmys; a lack of them wouldn't be the reason for its problems.
*   **C: Yaada Joon Giraant:** While LeVar Burton and others worked on the show, the passage doesn’t say his ideas caused it to end.
*   **D: Milkaa’ina Ollaa Obbo Roojars:**  Mr. Rogers' success is mentioned in relation to funding, not as a reason for the show's end.



"
Waa’ee mukichaa ilaalchisee kanneen armaan agdii keessaa Amistardamii fi muuziyeemiidhaaf angawwoonni kan irratti komii hin kaasne kami?,"Correct answer is **A: Kufuun isaa waan hin oolledha**.

Here's why:

The passage states the people of Amsterdam and Muizen were worried the fungus would **lead to death**.  The question asks which statement they *wouldn't* complain about.  If someone believes something *won't* lead to death, that wouldn't be a cause for complaint when they are worried about death.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Eegamuu qaba** - If they are worried about death, they *would* complain if it wasn't being monitored.
*   **C: Faangasiidhan faalameera** - Being infected is exactly what they’d complain about.
*   **D: Fayyaa uummataatif hamaadha** -  This is *why* they are complaining. They believe it is harmful to public health."
"Akkaataa qorataa olaanaa RSPCA tti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa qorannoon kamiif kan sadarkaa isaa eeggate ta’uu qaba?","The correct answer is **A: Kaamerawwan CCTV**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the RSPCA is pushing for mandatory CCTV cameras in Australian slaughterhouses. The chief inspector specifically says CCTV is the ""strongest signal"" to those working with animals that they are being monitored and held accountable. This directly links the highest priority of the RSPCA's investigation to the implementation of CCTV cameras.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nama bineensota wajjin hojjatu kamiyyuu** - While people working with animals are *affected* by the CCTV, the investigation itself focuses on the *cameras* as a tool for oversight.
*   **C: Meeshaalee to’annoo** - The passage doesn't mention specific testing equipment.
*   **D: Mana foonii** -  Slaughterhouses are not referred to as ""mana foonii"" (which generally means a veterinary clinic/hospital) and are not the focus of the investigation.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, hojjattoota mana foonii Awustiraaliyaatif fayyummaa bineensotaa kan cimsuuf maaltu gargaara?","The correct answer is **A: Kaameran CCTV dhaabbachuu** (Installing CCTV cameras).

**Here's why:**

The passage explicitly states that the RSPCA is advocating for mandatory CCTV cameras in Australian slaughterhouses. They believe CCTV provides a strong deterrent and assurance that people working with animals are acting humanely. This directly addresses how to improve animal welfare for Australian slaughterhouse workers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: RSPCA wajjin wal gahii murteessaa taasisuu** (Forming a strong partnership with the RSPCA) - While collaboration is good, the passage focuses on a *specific* measure (CCTV) the RSPCA is pushing for.
* **C: Dhaabbataan mana foonii to’achuu** (Closing the slaughterhouse) - The passage doesn't suggest closing slaughterhouses, but improving conditions within them.
* **D: To’annoo ABC irraa** (From ABC's investigation) - The ABC investigation is simply *reporting* on the issue; it's not a solution in itself.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, hojiin namicha hidhame sanaa maalidha?","The correct answer is **A: Barataa (Student)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...kan biraa barataan tokko dhukaasa mana barnootaa irratti bitootessa 21 ta’e waliin quunnamitii qaba jedhamuun hidhameera."" This directly translates to ""...another **student** was arrested on charges of conspiracy with a 21-year-old in connection with a school shooting.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Gaazexeessaa Miniyaappolis Istaar Tiribuun (Minneapolis Star Tribune Reporter):** The text mentions a reporter (Luuwii Juurdeeyin) but the arrested individual is not identified as the reporter.
*   **C: Gaggeessaa Gosaa (Gosaa Leader):** The text names ""Reed Leek"" as belonging to Gosaa, but doesn’t state that the arrested person is a leader.
*   **D: Angawaa Reed Leek (Reed Leek's Associate):** The text does not indicate any association between the arrested student and Reed Leek beyond Reed Leek being identified as the name of the student.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, namni biraa hidhamuu oduun tamsa’aa yeroo ture, awwaalcha namoota meeqatu gaggeeffamaa ture?","The correct answer is **B: Sadi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...miidhamtoota sagal keessa sadi yeroo qabamanu kan biraa barataan tokko..."" This directly translates to ""...one student was arrested along with three others previously detained from a group of nine victims..."" 

Therefore, the news reported the arrest of one person *while* an investigation involving three others was already underway.

Sababa balaa iPod’n baay’ee hoo’un uumameen namoota meeqatu muudhame?,"The correct answer is **B: 27**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...walee garmalee hoo’aa jiran 60’tti dhihaatan gabaafaman, waliigalaan abidda jahaaf ta’e akkasumas gubama midhama xiqqaa afur irra gahuuf sababa. ... balaan 27 akka muddate beekameera."" 

This translates to: ""...60 defective batteries were recalled, resulting in overall injury and causing minor burns to four people. ... it was revealed that 27 people were injured as a result of the incident.""

Therefore, 27 people were injured due to the overheating iPods."
Balaab baay’ee hoo’un uumame sun baay’ee cimaa miti eenyutu jedhe?,"The correct answer is **D: Appilii**.

The text states: ""Torban darbe, Appiliin rakkoowwan garmalee gubuu, kan kaampanichi “waan jabaa miti” jedhe, dabalataa 34 akka itti gabaasee ture...""  This translates to ""Last Tuesday, Apple announced 34 additional units affected by battery swelling issues, which the company said were 'not serious'."" 

Therefore, Apple is the one who stated the issue wasn't severe."
"Yeroo haasaa taasisu, Istiiv Joobs Appiliin maal irra deebin kalaquuf jira jedhee ture?","The correct answer is **A: Seenaa** (History).

Here's why:

The text states Steve Jobs said, “Har’a Appiliin bilbila haarawa uumuuf adeema, nutis har’a **seenaa hojjechuuf** adeemaa jirra” (Today Apple is going to reinvent the phone, and today we're going to **make history**). 

He directly states they are going to *make history*. The question asks what Apple is going to *recreate* or *make*, and ""history"" is the answer found within his quote.



"
Kaayyon haasaa sa’aatii lamaa Istiiv Joobs maalidha?,"The correct answer is **C: Bilbila haaraa beeksisuu** (To introduce a new phone).

Here's why:

The text states Steve Jobs used his keynote to *show off* the iPhone. He also said Apple was ""ready to reinvent the phone."" This directly indicates the purpose of the speech was to **introduce a new phone**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Taabileetii haaraa gadi lakkisuuf** (To introduce a new tablet) - The text focuses on the iPhone, not a tablet.
*   **B: Komitara haaraa gadi lakkisuu** (To introduce a new computer) - The text focuses on the iPhone, not a computer.
*   **D: Soorama bahuu isaa beeksisuuf** (To announce his retirement) - The text does not mention retirement.



"
Tiyaatira Arjentiinaa irratti Kiristiinaa Fernaandeez de Kirchnar maal beeksifte?,"Correct answer: **A: Pirezidaantummaaf kaadhimamuu ishee**

Here's why:

The passage states ""Aadde Kirchiiner Tiyatirii Arjentinaatti pirezdaantii ta’uuf akka dorgoman yaada isaanii beeksisanii jiru"" which translates to ""Mrs. Kirchner expressed her intention to compete for the presidency in Argentinian politics"". This directly means she announced her candidacy for president.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mana mareef dorgomuuf fedha akka qabdu** - While she has a campaign team, the text focuses on running for *president*, not just for office in general.
*   **C: Garee bulchiinsa Boonas Ayirasiif du;a gaggeessuu** - The text mentions her connection to Bonoo Sayras, but not that she is leading a campaign for them.
*   **D: Seenatarummaa ammaa irra jirturraa karoora qabaachuu ishee** - The text states she *is* a senator (Seenataari amma fi), but it's about her presidential ambitions, not plans related to her current role."
Kiristiinaa Fernaandeez de Kirchnar dorgomuuf akka fedha qabdu kan beeksifte eessatti?,"The correct answer is **B: Tiyaatira Boonas Ayiras La Pilaataatti argamutti**.

Here's why:

The text states she announced her intention to run for president at a theater in La Pilaata, which is 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires.  ""Tiyaatira Boonas Ayiras La Pilaataatti argamutti"" translates to ""at the theater in La Pilaata, Buenos Aires,"" accurately reflecting the information in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** ""La Pilaataa irraa maayilii 31 kan fagaatu tiyaatiratti"" - This just states the distance, not *where* she made the announcement.
* **C:** ""Boonas Ayiras irraa maayilii 31 kan fagaatu Tiyaatira Arjentinaatti"" - Incorrectly places the theater *in* Argentina generally, instead of specifically in La Pilaata.
* **D:** ""Boonas Ayiras keessatti kan argamu tiyaatira La Pilaatatti"" - Incorrectly suggests the theater is *in* Buenos Aires.



"
Big Birothers ilaalchisee argannoowwan ACMA maal fa’i?,"The correct answer is **B: Marsariitii Big Brothers irratti miidyaan kuusamee argame** (Media was found to be aired on Big Brothers).

Here's why:

The passage states that ACMA found content being shared online, but that the media *wasn't* aired on Big Brother. This led to Big Brother avoiding scrutiny under data laws. Therefore, the finding was related to media *appearing* on Big Brother.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Seerri to’annoo odeeffannoo (censorship law) cabee hin turre** (The censorship law wasn't applied) - The passage doesn't directly say the law wasn't applied, just that Big Brother avoided scrutiny.
*   **C: Seerii to’annoo odeeffannoo cabee ture** (The censorship law was applied) - The passage suggests Big Brother avoided the law, not that it was applied.
*   **D: Qabiyyeen isaa qaaman sarvarii keessa jira tire** (Its content resided physically on the server) - This is about where the content *should* be, not what ACMA discovered.



"
Miidiyaan tokko qabiyyee intarneetiti jedhamuuf ulaagaa kam jalatti ramadama?,"The correct answer is **B: Qaaman sarvarii irra jiraachuu qaba** (It must physically exist on a server).

Here's why:

The passage states, ""...qabiyyee intarneetii ilaalcha keessa galchuudhaan, qaamaan sarvarii irra jiraachuu qaba."" This directly translates to ""…considering internet content, it must physically exist on a server.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Intarneetii irratti darbuu qaba** (It must be published on the internet) - While publication is a result of being on a server, the passage emphasizes *where* it exists, not just that it's accessible.
*   **C: Marsariitii irra kaa’amuu hin danda’u** (It cannot be placed on a registry) - The passage mentions this as a *reason* for the issue, not a defining characteristic of internet content itself.
*   **D: ACMA dhaan mirkanaa’uu qaba** (It must be verified by ACMA) - ACMA is involved in the process, but verification isn't the defining factor of what *makes* something internet content.



"
Gaggeessan Paartii Libbaraalii Awustiraaliyaa eenyu?,"The correct answer is **A: Piitar Kosteello**.

The text states: ""Piiter Kaasteeloon, eegduun maallaqaa Awuustiraliyaa fi namichi akka dursaa paartii Liberaaliitti Muummicha Ministeeraa Joon Haawaarditti aanee muummicha ta’a jedhamee tilmaami olaanaan kennameef..."" This translates to: ""Pieter Costello, former Treasurer of Australia and a highly touted candidate to succeed Prime Minister John Howard as leader of the Liberal Party...""

Therefore, Piitar Kosteello (Pieter Costello) is the leader of the Liberal Party mentioned in the text.
"
Awustiraaliyaan maalif industirii anniisaa nikularaa hanga yoonaa hin qabaatin?,"The correct answer is **B: Baay’ee falmisiisadha (Very controversial)**.

Here's why:

The passage states Piiter Kaasteeloon is *actively campaigning against* developing a nuclear industry in Australia. His argument revolves around the economic viability and potential drawbacks, suggesting it's a debate with strong opposition.  This directly points to the issue being highly controversial.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Deeggarsa uummataa waan dhabeef (Lacks public support):** While public support might be a factor, the text focuses on Kosteloon's *arguments* against it, not necessarily a lack of support as the core reason.
* **C: Baay’ee balaafamaadha (Very dangerous):**  The passage doesn't mention safety as the primary reason for opposing nuclear energy.
* **D: Baay’ee qaalidha (Very expensive):** While cost is a consideration Kosteloon mentions economic viability (""daldalaaf ta'e""), it's presented as something Australia *should* consider if profitable, rather than inherently too expensive.



"
Deeggarsa nama qajeelchutiin nama cabbii sigigaatu kamtu dorgome?,"The correct answer is **C: Masiyej Kireezal**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Namootni Polaand ijumaan iskayeroota skier **Maciej Krezel** fi guide **Anna Ogarzynska** adda baasan kan kudhaa sadaffaa ta’ee xumure Super-G irratti."" 

This means Maciej Krezel is the skier who competed with the help of a guide (Anna Ogarzynska). A ""guide"" in skiing is a person who assists visually impaired skiers. Therefore, Maciej Krezel is the one receiving assistance.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Anna Jochemsan:** She competed independently and finished 9th.
*   **B: Joong Seork Paark:** He competed independently and finished 4th.
*   **D: Anna Ogarizyniska:** She is the *guide* assisting Maciej Krezel, not the one being assisted."
Dorgommii dubartootaa Super-G irratti biyya kamtu kurnaffaan xumure?,"The correct answer is **B: Neezarlaands**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Warra Neezerlandiin ni dabalatu, Anaa Jochemsan kutaa warra shammarranii keessa sagalafa taate xumuruun bakka Super-G’ti kaleessa..."" This translates to ""Including the Dutch, Anna Jochemsen finished ninth in the Super-G...""  Therefore, a Dutch skier (Anna Jochemsen) finished ninth, making the Netherlands the country mentioned in connection to a ranking in the women's Super-G.

The text also mentions Katja Saarineen from Finland finished eleventh, but the question asks for *ninth* place.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, waa’ee Bileek hima kamtu sirrii miti?","Correct answer is **C: Yeroo haleellaa raawwatu poolii fayyadame**.

Here's why:

The text states Bileek was trying to enforce the law and was arrested. It also says he was accused of using a weapon (""utubaa"") to defend himself from attackers.  There is *no* mention of him using the police during the assault. 

Let's look at why the other options are likely true based on the text:

* **A: Bakkichumatti to’annoo jala oole:** He was arrested and sent to jail (""gara mana hidhaati ergamuuf ture""), indicating he was under investigation.
* **B: Haleellaa gaggeessuusaa amane:** He admitted to giving a statement (""inni ibsa kennaa ture"") about the incident.
* **D: Qaruuratti natti darbatame jedhee himata:** The text explicitly says he claimed he used the weapon to defend himself from ""namoota soddoma ta’aniin itti darbamaa ture"" (people trying to attack him).



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’un, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kan Bileek irratti hin raawwanne kami?","Correct answer is **D: Mana hidhaatti ergamuunsaa akka hin oolle itti himame**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Abban murtichi Bileekiin akkas jedhe “dhorkuun kan hin danda’amne” gara mana hidhaati ergamuuf ture."" This directly translates to ""The judge Bileek said ""It is unforgivable"" he was to be sent to jail.""  This means he *was* sentenced to jail, not that it was denied to him.

Let's look at why the other options are potentially linked to Bileek's situation, according to the passage:

* **A: Haqa jallisuusaatif yakkamaa ta’uun itti murtaa’e:**  Bileek was trying to enforce the law, but it led to him being punished (presumably in the court case).
* **B: To’annoo jala oole:** The passage mentions a trial (""murtii"") where Bileek gave a statement (""ibsa kennaa ture"").
* **C: Poolidhaan haleellan irratti raawwate:** The passage talks about Bileek attempting to save people from being harmed (""akka miidhe ganee tarmuusa namoota soddoma ta’aniin itti darbamaa ture"").



"
Fandiin hoo’ina addunyaa  Dhaabbanni Gamtoomanii wantota akkamiitif itti fayyadamuun hin danda’amu?,"Correct answer is **C: Manneen lolaan galuu hin dandeenye**.

Here's why:

The passage states the organization aims to *prevent* damage from global threats and help vulnerable countries. Allowing access to conflict zones (manneen lolaan galuu) would be the opposite of prevention and would likely exacerbate problems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Callaa heddummeessuu:** The passage implies sharing technology, which could be seen as spreading capacity.
*   **B: Biyyoonni guddataa jiran teeknolojii akka argatan gochuu:** The passage specifically mentions helping major countries develop technology more effectively.
*   **D: Miidhaa hoo’ina addunyaa maksuu:** The organization aims to mitigate (maksuu) global threats.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, UN maal oolchuu hawwa?","The correct answer is **C: Bosona roobaa hafan**.

Here's why:

The passage states the purpose of the initiative is to help ""hammatu bosonoota adunyaa hafan"" (help vulnerable countries cope with climate change/disasters).  Specifically, it mentions helping with droughts and expanding irrigation.  ""Bosona roobaa hafan"" directly translates to ""vulnerable ecosystems/countries.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Qarshii, karaa teeknolojii qooduutiin (Money, through technology sharing)** - While technology sharing is *part* of the plan, the ultimate goal isn't just money.
*   **B: Callaa (Challenges)** - The passage doesn't focus on challenges themselves, but solutions to them.
*   **D: Namoota bishaan qulqullina hin qabneen miidhaman (People affected by lack of clean water)** - This is a *result* of the problem, but not the overarching goal the UN wants to achieve.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa waan ammayyuu irratti walii galamuu qabu kan Albart Muchaagaa hin eerin kami?,"Correct answer: **C: Tumaawwan (rules) jalqabaa**

Here's why:

The text states that they haven't agreed on ""rules of origin and tariff reduction"" yet. This directly refers to the initial rules/agreements needed for AfCFTA to function properly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Beening AfCTA tti dabalamti yoo ta’e** - The text mentions Benin being ready to host, not to join.
*   **B: Guyyaa daldalli jalqabu** - The text specifically states the trade *will* begin on July 1st, 2020.
*   **D: Taarifa dhiifamuu ykn fooyya’u** -  Tariff reduction is specifically mentioned as something they haven't agreed on."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, daldalli maalif Adoolessa eegaluu danda’a?","The correct answer is **B: Fireemwoorkii tumaawwanii fi wantonni fooyya’uu qaban lafa jiru.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hanga ammaatti seerota maddaa fi taarifa hir’isuu irratti walii hingalle, garuu caasaan nuti qabnu Adoolessa 1, 2020 tti daldala eegaluu nu dandeessisa,"" This translates to ""Until now, we haven't agreed on issues of tariffs and rules of origin, but the mandate we have allows us to start trading on July 1, 2020.""
* This clearly indicates that while some framework exists to *allow* trading to begin, there are still outstanding issues (tariffs and rules of origin) that need to be resolved.  Therefore, the trading can start because a basic framework is in place despite imperfections.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Addoolessa keessa eegaluun ulaagaa Naayijeeriyaan AfCFTA tti dabalamuuf keessedha:**  While Nigeria joining is important, the passage doesn't say the date is *because* of Nigeria joining. It's about the existing mandate.
* **C: Komishinarii daldalaa fi idustirii AUtiin tole jedhameera:** The commissioner stating it isn't the *reason* trading can start, it's an explanation of *how* it can start given the current situation.
* **D: Tumaawwan jalqabaa fi taarifa fooyya’u irratti walii galameera:** The passage explicitly states they *haven't* fully agreed on these things.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, Atilaantaa Journal-Constitution angawoota barnootaa maalif himate?","Correct answer: **D: Qabxuu qormaataa gadaanaa argachuu ykn gabaasuu**

**Explanation:**

The passage states that after the Atlanta Journal-Constitution published reports about test score irregularities, 34 educators were indicted for cheating on standardized tests in 2013. This directly indicates that the Journal-Constitution highlighted (and likely investigated and reported on) the issue of obtaining or disseminating illegal test answers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gabaasa Journal-Constitution waliin dhahuu ykn jijjiiruu:** The passage doesn’t say the educators were indicted for interacting with the Journal-Constitution.
*   **B: Barnoota magaalaa kalaquu dadhabuu:** While the passage mentions a review of the Atlanta school system, the indictment reason wasn't the system's overall failure but specific cheating.
*   **C: Rakkoolee keessoo mudatan irratti tarkaanfii fudhachuu dhabuu:** This isn't the reason for the indictment, the indictment was directly related to cheating.



"
"Odeeffannoo kuticha keessatti kenname irratti hundaa’un, gabaasa Atilaantaa Journal-Constitution keessatti kan hin eeramne maal ture?","Correct answer is **A: Qabxii qormaataa bifa hin baramneen fooyyessuu**.

Here's why:

The passage states that after Isheen's award and the Atlanta school system saw gains on free response questions, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution published a series of articles about testing irregularities.  It specifically mentions *concerns about cheating* and then later references 34 educators being indicted for cheating in 2013.  This all points to the **manipulation of test scores** (qabxii qormaataa bifa hin baramneen fooyyessuu) being the core issue that the newspaper reported on.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Waraqaalen qormaataa waliin dhahamuu** - While the passage mentions educators being indicted, it doesn't directly state that the *newspaper* was involved in the indictment.
* **C: Mo’ataa 2013’s National Superintendent Barichaa** - The passage doesn’t mention any superintendent award.
* **D: Barnoota magaalaa kalaquuf yaadota furmaataa** - The passage mentions Isheen being recognized for her work with the Atlanta school system, but doesn’t say the paper published thoughts on how to fix the school system.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, haleellaa boombii hordofee odeeffannoo maaltu beekama?","Correct answer is **D: Lakkoofsa namoota du’anii isa sirrii**.

Here's why:

The text states there are conflicting reports on the number of deaths (8 vs. up to 30), and the final, accurate number is unknown. The question asks what information is being sought following the bombing. Therefore, finding the true number of fatalities is the most logical piece of information to pursue.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Lakkoofsa namoota miidhamanii isa dhumaa** - While important, the text focuses more on the *deaths* and the discrepancies in that count.
*   **B: Gamoo ykn mana boombichi biratti dhohe** - The text states the bombings occurred at the ""cinaa gamoo mootummaatti"" (government district), so that location is already known.
*   **C: Boombiwwan dabalataa dhohuuf jiru yoo ta’e** - The text mentions additional bombs *did* explode, but doesn't indicate a current threat of more. The focus is on the aftermath of the explosions that already happened.



"
Erga bara 2017 Manchestar Siitii seenee Jiisas taphoota meeqa tapahate?,"The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The passage states: ""Ergasii, Biraaziltichi kilabii isaaf dorgommii hunda kessatti tapha 53 taphatee goolii 24 galche."" (After that, the Brazilian played 53 games for the club and scored 24 goals.)

The question asks how many games Jesus played *after* joining Manchester City in 2017. The passage directly answers this with 53 games.



"
Jiisas itti dabalamuudha £27 kan fudhate kilaba kamirraayi?,"The correct answer is **A: Paalmeyiras**.

The text states that Jesus was signed from Brazilian Palmeriyaas (Palmeiras) for a fee of £27 million. Therefore, Palmeiras is the club that received the £27 million transfer fee."
Waa’ee keessummoota hosteelichaa himni dhugaa hin taane kami?,"Correct answer is **A: Keessummoonni imala ykn pilgirimeejidhaaf Makkaa turan**.

Here's why:

The passage states the guests are *primarily* from the United Arab Emirates and are here for *visiting* the holy city in connection with Hajj. It doesn't say they *are* the pilgrims themselves. They may be family members visiting pilgrims, or people there for related purposes. The text specifies people *coming to visit* for Hajj, not that they *are* the pilgrims performing it.

Let's look at why the other options are likely true:

* **B: Keessummoonni tokko tokko lammiilee naannoo miti** - This is likely true since the passage specifies many are from the UAE, indicating they are not local to Mecca.
* **C: Keessummoonni jala bultii hajiitif achi turan** - This aligns with the passage's mention of people coming ""for Hajj.""
* **D: Keessummoonni harki caalan magaala qulqullittii irraayi** - The passage says the hostel is in Mecca, and many guests are there in connection to Hajj, suggesting a link to the holy city.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, himoota armaan gadii keessaa kamtu dhugaadha?","Correct answer is **C: Keessummoonni jala bultii deemsa hajiitif achi turan**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Gamoon kun namoota jilarra jiran, kanneen jalbultii imala hajjiitti magaalaa qulqullittii daawachuuf dhufan hedduu qabate."" This directly translates to ""The hotel has many people who are sick, those who came to visit the holy city for the Hajj pilgrimage.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Balaan du’aa homtuu hin turre** (There was no injury/death) - The passage explicitly states 15+ people died, so this is false.
*   **B: Keessummoonni hundinuu Yunaayitid Arab Emireetsi irraayi** (All guests are from the United Arab Emirates) - The passage says *most* are from the UAE, not *all*.
*   **D: Keessummoonni harki caalan Makkaadha** (The guests are mostly from Mecca) - The passage suggests they are *visiting* Mecca, meaning they are not from there.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’un, waa’ee walitti bu’iinsaa (collision) odeeffannoon shakkii hin qabne maali?","Correct answer: **C: Dhiibbaa walitti bu’iinsichaa lafa irratti**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states the scientists believe the impact was *very large* and are still working to determine *how it affected the Earth*. This directly addresses the impact's effect on the Earth (the land).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Guddina walitti bu’iinsaa (Size of the collision):** While the text mentions the asteroid's weight (1,000 tons) and speed (17,500 mph), it doesn't give a definitive measure of the *collision's* size.  It's still being studied.
* **B: Bakka walitti bu’iinsi itti uumame (Location of the collision):** The text only says they met ""over 491 miles from the Earth.""  It doesn't pinpoint the exact impact location.
* **D: Bakka caccabaa itti argamu (Location of the monitoring):** The text mentions NASA and the US government are tracking it, but doesn't provide specific details about where the monitoring is happening.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, waa’ee walitti bu’iinsaa ilaalchisee ammayyuu waanti murtaa’uu barbaadu maalidha?","The correct answer is **D: Hanga miidhaa qaqqabe isa sirrii** (The extent of the correct severe damage).

Here's why:

The text states that scientists believe the impact event was *very* large and are still working to determine ""how big the asteroid was and how the Earth reacted.""  This directly relates to understanding the *extent* of the damage caused by the impact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Caccabaa isaa barbaaduu eenyu akka gaggeessu** (Who is leading the investigation) - While the text mentions Ajaji Tarsiimaawaan Yuunaayitid Isteetsi is following, the core question is about *what* they are trying to find out, not *who* is doing the finding.
* **B: Yeroo walitti bu’iinsi uumamu saatalaayitoonni sun saffisa isaan ittiin deemaa turan** (The speed at which the satellites were traveling when the impact occurred) - The text provides speed information (17,500 miles per hour) but doesn't suggest this is what scientists are still trying to determine.
* **C: Akkaatan itti bu’aa xinxaala karoorsan ni qoodama** (The method of sharing planned impact calculations) - This is not mentioned in the text at all.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, tarree Dureeyyii Ameerikaa keessatti yeroo tokko Battten meeqaffaa ture?","The correct answer is **C: 190ffaa**.

The passage states: ""Bateen 190ffaa irra ka’amee ture..."" which translates to ""Bateen was ranked 190th..."" 

Therefore, Bateen was 190th in the Dureeyyii (Forbes) list of America."
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa Batten kamiif arjoome?,"Haala itti dhiyaate kana keessatti, Batten Yuunivarsiitii Viirjiiniyaatii koolleejjii Aartiifi Saayinsii eebbifame. Akkasumas dhaabbatichaaf gumaacha guddaa taasiseera.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the law applies *within* California (""kan isteeta Kaalifoorniyaa keessatti""). It doesn't mention anything about regulating video distribution *outside* of California.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Guutummaa Kaalifoorniyaa keessatti viidiyoon waa’ee haleellaa ijoollee umuriin hin geenyetti akka hin gurguramne dhorkuu** - The passage states the law aims to prevent the distribution of such videos *within* California.
*   **B: Warra seera cabsaniif adabbii maallaqaa** - The passage mentions a $1000 fine for violating the law.
*   **D: Viidiyoowwan haleellaa irratti dizaayinii (decal) gaafachuu** - The passage states videos must have an ""18"" decal to be legal.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, waan jedhamaa ture eenyutu hin dhagahin ture?","The correct answer is **B: Maayik**.

Here's why:

The text states Miller said, ""Maayikiin yeroo caqasamuu baay’ee hasa’aa ture..waan inni jedhaa ture akkan hin dhageenyetti qophaa’aan ture."" which translates to ""Maayik was very angry when he was interrogated... he was careful that I wouldn't hear what he said."" 

This directly means Maayik's words weren't heard. The question asks who didn't hear what was being said."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa dhaddacha (hearing) irratti muuxannoo Miilar ilaalchisee hima kamtu dhugaadha?","The correct answer is **B: Yeroo inni qophaa’aa ture yaada itti kennaa hin turre.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""waan inni jedhaa ture akkan hin dhageenyetti qophaa’aan ture."" This translates to ""He was preoccupied so he couldn't hear what was being said.""  Being preoccupied means he wasn't able to give his opinion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yeroo dhaddachaa Duuval miira Miilar hawwateera:** The passage doesn’t mention anything about Duuval liking Miilar’s scent.
* **C: Yeroo dhaddachaa ijoollen Duuvaal lamaan baay’ee haasa’an:** The passage focuses on Miilar’s experience, not how much the children talked.
* **D: Seenaa Duuvaal qalbiin dhaggeeffataa ture:** The passage doesn't say Duuval was listening attentively; it focuses on Miilar's inability to *hear* due to being preoccupied.



"
‘Labsii Qileensa Qulqulluu (Clean Air Act) irratti fooyya’iinsi akka ta’u eenyutu yaada dhiyeesse?,"The correct answer is **C: Jaak Laaytan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Leeyitaan yeroo walgahii PM waliin godheetti seerri qilleensa naannoorratti warra seera cimsitootaan dhiiffame akka jijjiiramuu fi seerri kunuunsa naannoo paartii Konsarvatiivii “irradeebiin gadifageenyaa fi guutummaatti akka barreeffamuuf,”gaafatee ture."" 

This means Jaak Leeyitan specifically requested changes to the Clean Air Act during a meeting with the PM. While the Conservative party wants the act rewritten, it was Leeyitan who brought up the issue *during the meeting*.



"
Labsiin Qilleensa Qulqulluu filannoo dura akak ulaagatti itti dhimma bahamaa jira jechuun kan diede eenyudha?,"The correct answer is **D: Miseensa parlaamaa federaalaa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...mootummaan biyyichaatii fi miseensonni paarlaamaa federaalaa tokko tokko gocha kana filannoo federaalaa Sadaasa keessaa dhufaa jiruuf kan ittiin qalbii namaa hatanidha jechuun qeeqanii jiru."" 

This translates to ""...the federal government and some federal parliamentarians questioned whether this action was intended to win votes in the upcoming federal election.""  Therefore, federal parliamentarians are the ones expressing concern that the Clean Energy Bill is being used strategically before the election.



"
Kompaawundiiwwan saayinurik asiidi fi melaamiinii fincaan hantuutaa keessatti yoo wal-nyaachatan maaltu uumama?,"The correct answer is **A: Kaleewwan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kompaawuundonni lamaan kiristaala umuuf walnyaatu kunis hojiin kalee akka dhaabbatu godha..."" which translates to ""These two compounds reacting to form crystals also cause the reaction to stop...""  Therefore, the reaction of saayinurik asiidi and melaamiinii creates crystals, and those crystals *are* the kaleewwan (stopping agent/precipitate).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nyaata bineensota manaa** - The passage mentions this in relation to where the crystals were *found*, not what they *are*.
*   **C: Waanta jajjabaataa** - This is too vague and not supported by the text.
*   **D: Infireerd Ispeektirooskoppii** - This is a tool used *to study* the crystals, not what the compounds create.



"
Qorattoonni Infireerd Ispeektirooskoppii maal ilaaluf itti fayyadamu?,"The correct answer is **B: Waanta jajjabaataa fincaan bineensota manaa keessatti argamu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yeroo ispeektirooskooppii infiraareediitiin(jijjiirama fuuriyeerii spectirooskoppii infraareedii) walmadaalchifamu qabiyyeen kiristaalota kanaa fincaan beeyladoota manaa warren faalamaniin walsimata.""

This translates to: ""When analyzed with infrared spectroscopy, the structure of these crystals matched substances found in the stomach contents of cows.""

Therefore, the researchers used infrared spectroscopy to identify *what* was present in the cows' stomachs – the substances/compounds. This makes option B the most accurate answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hojii kalee (The next task)** - While the compounds prevent further digestion, the spectroscopy wasn't *for* the next task, but to analyze the crystals.
*   **C: Bineensota manaa ittiin qabaman (Cows being caught)** - The passage doesn't mention anything about catching cows.
*   **D: Nyaata bineensota manaa faalame (Digested cow food)** -  The spectroscopy looked at what was *in* the stomach contents, not specifically digested food. It matched the crystals to substances *found within* the contents.



"
Luunaa akka “Kuwiin of Ikstiriim” tti kan fudhate eenyu?,"The correct answer is **A: Daastin Raanals**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dastiin """"Gooldlast"""" Raanels yaada kenneen """"Luunaan akkumakoo maraattuu turte, tarii anayyuu caalaa...nan jaaladha, isheen yaadas...iddoo irra gaarii jirti jedheen abdadha,"""" "". This directly translates to Dustin ""Golddust"" Raanels saying he feels Luna is even better than himself and admires her. This indicates he ""took to"" Luna as an ""Extreme Queen"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Zhiinuwaa:** The text mentions Zhiinuwaan observing the situation but doesn't say he took to Luna.
*   **C: Hogganaa Luunaa:** This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Toomii Diriimar:** Tommy Dreamer expresses respect for Luna, but doesn't state he ""took to"" her in the same way Raanels does.



"
Luunaa akka “nama amala addaa” qabuutti kan fudhate eenyu?,"The correct answer is **D: Toomii Diriimar**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tommy Dreamer akkas jedhe “Luunaan Giiftii Gadi fagoo jalqabaadha. Manaajaraa koo jalqaba. Luunaan kan boqotte halkan ji’a lama qabuttii dha. **Akkuma ishee baayee adda.

Tommy Dreamer directly describes Luna as being ""very different"" (addaa), indicating he perceives her as having a unique personality.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Deeggartoota ishee (Her supporters):** The text doesn't mention supporters specifically commenting on her personality. They simply showed respect.
*   **B: Daastin Raanals (Dustin Raanals):** Dustin Raanals expressed affection and admiration, but didn't focus on her being *different*.
*   **C: Qorattoota mootummaa (Government investigators):** They were focused on the 'sanduq gurraachi' (box chase) and didn't comment on Luna's personality.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Yoodhumaa yeroo makiinichi ittirukutame namni sadii manicha keessa turaniyyuu, isaan keessaa kan miidhame garuu hin jiru."" (When the car crashed, three people were in the house, but none of them were injured).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mataan isaa miidhameera** (His head was injured) - The passage states the driver suffered a *severe* head injury.
* **C: Hospitaala Kaambiriij jirurraa gara isa Gireet Yaarmuz jiruutti dabarfame** (He was transferred from the Cambridge hospital to the Yarmuz Greece hospital) - The passage says he was transferred *to* Addenbrooke's in Cambridge *from* James Paget in Yarmouth.
* **D: Hojjattoota balaa tasaatu konkolaataa isaa keessaa isa baase** (Emergency workers immediately removed him from the car) - The passage states rescuers removed him, not just emergency workers.

"Yeroo dorgommii raagbitti, waa’ee tapaha Afrikaa Kibbaa waanti bahee hin mul’anne maal ture?","Correct answer is **A: Hojii garee ajaa’ibsiisaa**

Here's why:

The passage states that the South African team's ""remarkable team work,"" ""ability to hold the ball,"" and ""defensive work rate"" were clearly visible and contributed to their win.  The question asks what wasn't apparent *until* the match. The passage implies their teamwork was the standout, unexpected element that led to their victory.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Dandeettii kubbaa qabachuu (Ability to hold the ball):** This was explicitly mentioned as being visible.
* **C: Jalqabbii dorgommichaatti gahuumsa sirrii (Correct early performance):** The passage talks about their performance *throughout* the match, not just the start.
* **D: Dandeettii ittisuu (Defensive ability):** This was also stated to be visible.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, taphni Afrikaa Kibbaa fooyya’uu kan eegale yoomi?","The correct answer is **B: Erga itftisa cimsanii booda** (After they recovered from the heat).

Here's why:

The passage states that despite initially appearing to lack skill (due to the heat), the South African team ""fooyya’an"" (recovered/improved) *after* observing their brothers in the south. This observation helped them adapt and perform better. The passage doesn't specify a precise time like 10:00 am as the start of their improvement, nor does it directly link it to Zambia's score or the start of the match.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Naannoo 10:00 am** - The passage mentions 10:00 am as when the weather was good, but doesn't say the team started improving *at* that time.
*   **C: Zaambiyaan erga mo’amanii booda** - Zambia being scored against doesn’t trigger South Africa's recovery.
*   **D: Dorgommiin osuma itti fufee jiruu** - The passage states their improvement *followed* an initial struggle during the match, not that it happened *while* the match was progressing in its initial state.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states: ""Yeroo jalqabaaf, Chaayinaan Jaarmanii caalaa konkolaataa baay’ee gara alaatti ergitee..."" (For the first time, China exported more cars than Germany...)

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: Erga jijjiiramni godhamee kaasee diinagdeen Chaayinaa saffisaan guddate** - The text says ""hammi guddinii dinagdee Chaayinaa harka 90n guddateera"" (China's economic growth has increased by 90 times), indicating rapid growth.
*   **B: Chaayinaan konkolaataa alatti erguun Yunaayit Isteetis caala gabaa guddaa qabdi** - The text mentions China becoming a major industrial exporter, implying significant profits.
*   **C: Chaayinaan yeroon booda Yunaayitid Isteetis caalaa GDP guddaa qabaatti** - The text states ""Waggoota kurnaan dhufaan lama keessatti GDP’n Chaayinaa kan Yuunayiitid Isteetsi caaluu danda’a"" (In the next two decades, China's GDP may exceed that of the United States).

Therefore, option D is the only statement that contradicts the information provided in the text."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, GDPn Chaayinaa yoom kan Yunaayitid Isteetis darba?","Correct answer is **D: Waggaa soddoma keessatti**.

The passage states: ""Waggoota kurnaan dhufaan lama keessatti GDP’n Chaayinaa kan Yuunayiitid Isteetsi caaluu danda’a."" which translates to ""Within the next two decades, China’s GDP could surpass that of the United States.""  ""Soddoma"" means decades in Afaan Oromoo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jijjiirama diinagdee dabalataa booda** - While trade changes are part of the overall economic picture, the passage doesn't specify *when* the GDP will surpass the US, only a timeframe.
*   **B: Waggaa digdama keessatti** - This is too vague and not mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Gaggeessaa haaraa jalatti** - The passage mentions leadership (Deng Ziaaying), but doesn’t connect the GDP surpassing the US to a *new* leader."
Biyyoonni guddataa jiran ni godhuu jedhee Hu kan yaada kenne maalidha?,"The correct answer is **A: Gulantaa guddina isaanii kan ol butu itti gaafatamummaa fudhachuu qabu**.

Here's why:

The passage states Hu ""jajjabeesse biyyootni guddataa jiran """"daandii dulloomaa jalqaba faalanii achiin booda qulqulleessuu akka baqatan"""" and added “gochuu hin qaban, haa ta’uu iyuu malee, dirqamaa sadarka guddina isaanii irratti akka fudhatan gaafatamuu, itti gaafatamumma fi dandetti.”""  This translates to him suggesting major countries shouldn't prioritize quick gains (the ""first path of pollution"") but *should* take responsibility and accountability for their growth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bu’aa diinagdee irratti xiyyeeffachuu** - The passage focuses on environmental responsibility *alongside* growth, not solely on economic results.
*   **C: Itti gaafatamummaa amma qaban gararraatti hojjachuu** - He's suggesting a *higher* level of accountability related to growth, not just continuing current levels.
*   **D: Daandii faalama durii dhiisuu** - While implied, the core of his statement is about the *responsibility* countries should take, not just stopping pollution.



"
Waanti Hu hin eerin maalidha?,"The correct answer is **D: Hanga ykn lakkoofsa hanga aara kaarbonii cituu ykn dhaabbatuu** (The amount or number by which carbon emissions will be reduced or stopped).

Here's why:

The passage states Hu said emissions will *end* by 2020 as a percentage of GDP. However, he **didn't specify the *amount* of the reduction**. He only talked about the *way* it would be measured (as a percentage of GDP). He also didn't give a baseline or target number for actual emissions reduction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hir’isuudhaf bu’uura (basis for the cuts)** - He implies the basis is GDP-linked, so he *addressed* this, even if not in detail.
*   **B: Faalama ilaalchisee biyyoota guddataa jiranii gorsa kennuu** - He explicitly advised large countries to ""take the lead and then strengthen their actions"".
*   **C: Aarri kaarbonii guyyaa itti dhaabbata jedhamee abdatamu** - He stated the *year* emissions would stop being linked to GDP (2020).

The text states, ""Riichaardi Veermaan...akkaata kanaan duraa caalaa ammaataatti adeemaa jirti, haalichi immoo **Angoolaa** keessatti baay’ee badaa ta’ee itti fufa.""  This translates to ""Richard Veermaan...the situation in **Angola** is getting worse than ever before, and the situation is very bad and worsening.""

He specifically says the situation is bad *in Angola*. The other options are organizations mentioned in the text but are not the places he identifies as having a worsening, bad situation."
"Qorannaa irraa kan ka’e, bakka Kaabinee Huhne kan fudhatu eenyudha?","The correct answer is **A: Deevii**. 

The text states: ""Huhineen gadhiiseera kanaaf Kaabinee keessatti Miseensa Paarlaaamaa Iid Deeviitiin bakka buusama."" This translates to ""Huhne’s resignation will be filled in Cabinet by MP Iid Deevi."""
Qorannoo booda bakka Ministeer Biizinasii kan fudhatu eenyudha?,"The correct answer is **A: Laamb**.

The text states: ""Miseensi Paarlaamaa Noorman Laambi, bakka hojii duwwaa ministeera biizinasii Deeviin uumame akka fudhatan ni eegama."" This directly translates to ""Parliamentary Member Noorman Lamb is expected to take over the vacated post of the Department for Business created by Deevi.""

Therefore, Laamb will be taking over the role."

*   **A:** There's no mention of cannabis use.
*   **B:** The opera is about an artist who loved and was fascinated by Japan, but the audience doesn't go *to* Japan.
*   **D:** The passage says the artist's life was the *subject* of the opera, not that the audience identified with it in that way.

Here's why:

The passage states the opera is *about* an artist ""whose life was full of passionate love and Japanese influences.""  The description focuses on the artist being the subject of the opera and the cause of the audience's strong reaction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dhaggeeffattoota ykn hirmaattota Faransaayi (French listeners or participants):** The passage doesn't say the audience *starts* the drama, it says the drama affects them.
* **C: Warra agarsiisan (The performers):** The passage says the performers *portray* the artist and cause a reaction *in* the audience, but they aren't the starting point of the story.
* **D: Kamiilaa Saint-Saens (Camille Saint-Saëns):** He is the composer, not the subject of the opera's plot.

“Hawaa keessa deemuu (spacewalk)” kan Liyoonov agarsiise maqaan biraa maal jedhama?,"The correct answer is **C: Hojii konkolataa hawaatin alatti hojjatamu (Extravehicular activity)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Liyoonov's first EVA was also known as “deemsa hawwaarraa” (a walk in space) and then clarifies that EVA stands for ""Hojii konkolataa hawaatin alatti hojjatamu"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ergama Apollo-Soyuz:** This was a later mission Liyoonov participated in, not the name of the spacewalk itself.
* **B: Dorgommii Hawaaa:** This isn't mentioned in the text.
* **D: Koosmoonot Lakk. 11:** This refers to Liyoonov's callsign/name, not the spacewalk.



"
Leyoonov kutaa ergama Sooviyeetii kam durse?,"The correct answer is **B: Apooloo-Sooyuz**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Wagga kudhanii booda, ergama **Appollo Soyuzii** qaama Sooviyet hogganuun imallii gara hawwa akka xumurame mallattoo godhe.""  This directly says Leyoonov led the Soviet side of the Apollo-Soyuz mission, marking the end of the space race.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dorgommii Hawaa (Space Race)** - While Leyoonov *participated* in the space race, he didn't lead a specific mission *called* the Space Race.
*   **C: Koosmoonot Lakk. 11 (Kosmonaut No. 11)** - This refers to the mission he was known *from*, not a mission he led.
*   **D: EVA** - EVA (Extravehicular Activity/spacewalk) is what he *did* on a mission, not the name of a mission he led.



"
Walitti bu’iinsa (crash) sana keessatti eenyutu miidhame?,"The correct answer is **A: Giibsan**.

The text states: ""Erga balaan uumamee, Giibsen gara hospitaalaatti geeffamus yeroo muraasa booddee lubbuunsaa darbeera."" This translates to: ""After the accident, Giibsen was taken to the hospital, but he died shortly after."" 

Therefore, Giibsen was the one who was injured and died in the crash. The text also specifically states the driver was unharmed."
Namoota balaan irra gahe sana maaltu isaanirra gahe?,"The correct answer is **B: Tokko miidhamee, tokko du’e** (One was injured, one died).

Here's why:

* The text states Giibsen was taken to the hospital after the accident but died shortly after. This means one person died.
* The text also states the driver was unharmed (""Konkolaachisaan, umriin isaa waggaa 64, balaa keessatti hin miidhamne""). However, the passengers were frightened and shouting (""daa’imman daandii qaxxaamuruuf dhaabbataa turan isaanis iyya dhageessisaafi boo’aa turan"").  While not physically *injured* in the sense of wounds, being frightened and traumatized can be considered a form of harm or being affected by the accident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lammanuu ni du’an** (Both died) - Only Giibsen is stated to have died.
* **C: Iyyanii boo’aa turan** (They were shouting) - This describes the reaction of the passengers, not the overall outcome for them.
* **D: Lamaanuu miidhamaniiru** (Both were injured) - The driver was unharmed.



"
Saayintistoonni saganticha irratti hojjatan mijidhawwan isaan ilaaluu barbaadan wantoota armaan gadii keessaa kamiin kan dhufaniidha?,"Correct answer is **D: Daark Maatarii**

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that the theory explains the existence of a large amount of dark matter around galaxies, and is derived from simulating the Sagittarius galaxy. It also mentions how dark matter objects can ""see"" each other, and the interaction between the Milky Way and Sagittarius galaxies is related to dark matter.

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Wantoota (matter) idilee:** While matter is involved, the focus is specifically on *dark* matter, which is not the same as regular, visible matter.
*   **B: Humna olka’uufi gadi bu’uu galaanaa:** Gravity is mentioned as an effect *of* the dark matter, but it isn’t what the scientists are looking *for* specifically.
*   **C: Partikiloota xixiqqoo:** The passage mentions that dark matter is comprised of a lot of small particles, but the main focus of the research is the dark matter itself, not just the particles it's made of.



"

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’un, warra konsarvaativiitin maaltu hin qeeqamne?","Correct answer is **A: Baasii gargaarsaa**.

Here's why:

The passage states conservatives are pleased with the ""Waliigaltee Niwu Oorliinsii Buush"" and are focused on challenging the re-authorization agreements that resemble those seen in Washington. This implies their concern *isn't* with the cost of re-authorization itself (D), the contracts for re-authorization (C), or the lack of re-authorization efforts (B). Instead, they are focused on the *spending* within those re-authorization agreements, specifically relief spending.

Therefore, the one thing they *don't* seem to be questioning is the cost of relief (baasii gargaarsaa)."
Tattaffii gargaarsa Haarikeen Kaatiriinif eenyutu kontiraatwwan irra deebisanii ijaaruu komataa jira?,"Correct answer: **A: Konsarvatiivota fiiskaalii**

Here's why:

The passage states the deal, pleasing conservatives, is called the ""New Orleans Bush Deal."" It then notes that the liberal complaint focuses on the contractor re-bidding seeming similar to those known within Washington. This suggests conservatives are the ones benefiting from and pushing for the re-bidding contracts after Hurricane Katrina. 

Here's how the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Libiraalota** - The passage specifically says liberals *complain* about the re-bidding.
*   **C: Buush** - Bush is associated with the *name* of the deal, but not the one actively seeking the contracts.
*   **D: Warra Waashingtan keessa jiran** - While the re-bidding process resembles those in Washington, they aren’t the ones initiating the complaints."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, ifni konkolaataa hawaa Istaardast (Stardust spacecraft) jalqaba eessatti mul’ata?","The correct answer is **B: Kaaliforniyaa Kaabaa**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yeroo kaapsuliin lafa ga’uu fi atiimosfeeri seenuu, gara ganama keessaa sa’aatii 5’tti (yeroo warra baha), **namoota Kaaliforniyaa Kaabaa, Oreegoon, Nevaada, fi Utaah** jiraataniif agarsiisa baay’ee ifaa kenna."" 

This directly says that the first place people will see the Stardust spacecraft is in Northern California. While it will also be visible in Oregon, Nevada, and Utah, California is listed first and is the initial sighting location.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, wantoota armaan gadii keessaa konkolaatan hawaa rikardii kan galmeessu kamiifi?","Correct answer is **C: Dafee gara Lafaatti deebi’uu**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states the object is intended to ""return to Earth with the highest speed ever,"" and it's referencing breaking the record set by Apollo X in 1969. This is the core of the record it's trying to break.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Samii gara caalu ibsa** - While the object *is* visible from the sky, that's a consequence of its flight, not the record itself.
*   **B: Magaalota heddu keessatti mul’achuu** - Visibility across multiple cities is also a consequence, not the record-breaking aspect.
*   **D: Saan Firaansiskoo irraa saffisaan gara Los Anjalasitti deemuu** - This is used as an example of the speed, but the record isn’t *just* about traveling between those cities; it’s about the return to Earth.



"
"Dr. Malar Balasubramanian, Saroja Balasubramanian dhaaf maalidha?","The correct answer is **A: Obboleettii** (Sister).

The text states: ""Reeffa Saroojaa Balasubramaniyaan, umurii 53, kan uffata halkanii dhiigaan makameen marame argan."" This translates to ""The body of Sarojaa Balasubramanian, 53, was found dressed in a sari stained with blood.""  Then it mentions Dr. Malar Balasubramanian was arrested in connection to her death. This implies a familial relationship, and the most likely relationship given the context is sister.



"
Reeffi Sara Balasubramanian eessaa argame?,"The correct answer is **C: Duddeeba konkolaataa (trunk) keessa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Achitti, reeffa Saroojaa Balasubramaniyaan, umurii 53, kan uffata halkanii dhiigaan makameen marame argan."" This translates to ""There, the body of Saroojaa Balasubramanian, 53 years old, dressed in a halter top stained with blood was found.""  The body was found *inside* the Oldsmobile Intrigue, which implies it was in the trunk since that's where bodies are often hidden in such cases.



"
eBay dhaan maaltu bitame ykn dhuunfatame?,"Correct answer is **C: Iskaayippii**.

The passage states eBay is looking to expand Skype's presence in areas like China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil. Therefore, eBay acquired Skype."
Waan argateen eBay maal galmaan gahuu barbaada?,"Correct answer is **B: Bakka haaratti babal’achuu**

**Explanation:**

The text states eBay is looking to expand its presence in regions where Skype is already strong (China, Eastern Europe, Brazil). This directly relates to *expanding into new markets* or *growing its reach*.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Galii isaa dhuunfachuu (Increase its revenue):** While expansion *can* lead to increased revenue, the text focuses on *where* they want to grow, not immediately on revenue goals.
*   **C: Maqaa isaa guddisuu (Increase its name/brand awareness):** Increasing brand awareness is a *result* of expansion, but not the primary goal stated.
*   **D: Warra keessaa qooda qaban (shareholders) gammachiisuu (Satisfy shareholders):**  Satisfying shareholders is a general business objective, but the text specifically highlights geographic expansion.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, erga lolli ka’ee booda namoota mana hidhaa keessa jiran wajjin kan hin dubbanne eenyu?","Correct answer is **B: Hojjattoota ittisa balaa abiddaa**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the riot police (hojjattoota ittisa balaa abiddaa) *declared the situation over* at 11:35 pm. This implies they didn't engage in conversation *with* the inmates during the riot itself.  The passage focuses on their actions to *end* the riot, not to negotiate or communicate with the prisoners.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Warra walitti araarsan:** The passage mentions they tried to resolve the situation, indicating some level of interaction.
*   **C: Hojjattoota:** This is too vague. The passage doesn't state if all ""workers"" didn't communicate.
*   **D: Hojjattoota hospitaalaa:** The passage says prisoners were taken to the hospital, implying some interaction with hospital staff.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa hidhamtoonni hokkara akka dhiisan kan taasise maalidha?,"Correct answer is **B: Gaasii imimmaanessu**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that officers entered the room and used gas to subdue the inmates, eventually forcing them to return to their cells. This is the direct cause of the inmates leaving the recreation area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Marii milkaa’aa:** The text doesn't mention a successful negotiation. It states Warren attempted to mediate but the inmates' intentions weren't clear.
*   **C: Hidhamtoota warra madaa’an:** The inmates who were recently released from solitary confinement started the incident, but they didn’t *make* the others leave.
*   **D: Abidda:** The riot itself was the situation, not the direct cause of the inmates being moved. The gas was used *during* the riot to regain control.



"
"Akka yaada Ayaatolah Ali Khameenitti, Iraan maal irraa bilisa of-gochuu qabdi?","The correct answer is **B: Warraaqsa Islaamaa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gaggeessaa ol aanaan biyyattii, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, maxxantummaa zayita irrattii akka “qabduu” warraaqsi Islaamummaa Iraan bara 1979 duraa eegalee kan turee fi kan biyyattiin irraa bilisa of baasuu qabduutti ibsan."" 

This translates to: ""The country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, described the dependence on oil as a 'shackle' that Iran's Islamic revolution had to break free from since 1979.""

Therefore, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei believes Iran needs to free itself from the **Islamic Revolution's legacy of dependence on oil**.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, dhiibbaa qoqqobbiin diinagdee Iraanirratti geessise kan amane eenyudha?","The correct answer is **C: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gaggeessaa ol aanaan biyyattii, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, maxxantummaa zayita irrattii akka “qabduu” warraaqsi Islaamummaa Iraan bara 1979 duraa eegalee kan turee fi kan biyyattiin irraa bilisa of baasuu qabduutti ibsan.""  This translates to: ""The country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, described the dependence on oil as a 'shackle' that Iran has been carrying since before the 1979 Islamic revolution and that the country needs to free itself from.""

This directly identifies Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as the one who views the reliance on oil as a hindrance to Iran's progress and a problem the country needs to overcome. Therefore, he's the one who *believes* the oil dependence is hindering Iran.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa qaama adeemsa filannoo Faransaayi kan hin taane kami?,"Correct answer is **D: Sagalee bakka bu’oota kaadhimamaatin lakkaa’amu**.

Here's why:

The passage states that proxies (kaadhimamtoota) can *observe* the process, but it doesn't mention their votes being *counted*. The focus is on the original voters casting their ballots and the verification process to ensure a valid count.

Let's look at why the other options *are* part of the French election process:

*   **A: Korojoo filannoo haqa qabeessa (Fair election committee):** The passage implies oversight and legal frameworks related to ensuring proper elections.
*   **B: Bakka bu’oota kaadhimamaan ergaman (Proxies sent by challengers):** Specifically mentioned as being able to monitor the process.
*   **C: Galmee filannoorratti mallatteessuu (Signing the poll book):** Mentioned as part of the voter's action after casting their ballot.

Therefore, counting votes cast *by* proxies is not a stated part of the described French election process."
Warri sagalee kennan kaadhimamaa isaanii eessatti filatu?,"The correct answer is **B: Waraqaa irratti** (On the ballot paper).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""warri filatan ofiisaanii saanduqaa filannoo keessaaddaan of baasu, baallee waraqaa duraan maxxanfame kan nama isaan filatan ibsu saanduqa filannoo keessa buusu."" This translates to ""voters cast their votes by placing a paper ballot with the name of their chosen candidate into the ballot box.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Galmee filannoo irratti** (At the election meeting) - The passage doesn't mention voting at a meeting.
*   **C: Poostaa irratti** (By post) - The passage describes a traditional ballot box system, not postal voting.
*   **D: Maashinii golgaa keessa jiru irratti** (On a voting machine) - The passage specifically mentions paper ballots.



"
Waggaa saddeetif akka Musaashii barbaaduf maaltu Alan kakaase?,"The correct answer is **A: Qabeenya isaa (His wealth)**.

Here's why:

The passage states Allen ""kan maallaqaa isaa guddaa irratti dhangalaasuun hojaatu hojii aloolaa galaanarraati"" which translates to ""spent a large amount of his wealth on unusual underwater projects"".  It then says he began searching for Musashi to ""fulfill his lifelong obsession with wartime wrecks."" This implies his wealth enabled and motivated the search.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Garaa bishaanii jala qorachuuf (Seabed mapping) waan fedhii qabuuf:** While seabed mapping was *used* in the search, the passage doesn't state this was the initial motivation.
* **C: Invsetimentii isaa qaama bishaan qorachuu marine exploration) irratti:** Similar to B, this is a consequence of his wealth and interest, not the root cause.
* **D: Fedhii inni waraanicharratti qabu (His interest in wrecks):**  This is the *reason* he wanted to find the Musashi, but the passage says his *wealth* allowed him to pursue that reason over eight years.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, Alan maallaqa isaa guddaa maal irratti baase?","Correct answer is **A: Mustaashii iddootti deebisuu**

Here's why:

The text states Allen is ""kan maallaqaa isaa guddaa irratti dhangalaasuun hojaatu hojii aloolaa galaanarraati ammamoo fedhii lolaa bara jieenyasaa guutuu qabuuf Musaashii baasuf karaa barbaadu jalqabeera."" This directly translates to: ""spending his large fortune on an underwater mission to find Musashi to fulfill his lifelong obsession."" 

Therefore, Allen is spending his fortune on bringing Musashi back.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa warshicha keessa fi naannoo isaatti haala balaa qabuuti kan geessuu malu kami?","The correct answer is **A: Boba’aa yuraaniyeemii (Uranium leakage)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states ""kontiineeriin boba’aa yuraniiyem baatuu kun bakkeetti tarii uratee akkasumas yaaseera ta’a"" which translates to ""This leaking uranium container has spread on the ground and has also evaporated.""  A uranium leak is the most direct and significant hazard mentioned in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Kaasiyeemii raadiyoo aktiivii ta’e (Radioactive Cesium):** While Cesium is mentioned as being *detected* at the plant, the text doesn’t state it *causes* the hazard, but rather that it *is* the hazard being measured.
* **C: Aara adii (Heat/Warmth):**  The text mentions heat (""haaromsituu qilleensaa cufaa"") but doesn’t present it as the primary hazard causing the danger.
* **D: Ayodiinii (Iodine):** Similar to Cesium, Iodine is detected, but the text doesn't indicate it is the source of the danger.



"
Taatee warshitti mudate hordofee kanneen armaan gadii keessaa odeeffannoo of-eeggannoo jiraattota naannotiif kenname kan hin taane kami?,"The correct answer is **D: Bishaan boonbaa dhuguu dhiisuu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""haaromsituu qilleensaa cufaa akkasumas bishaan uujummoo hin dhuginaa"" - meaning the water supply is *not* safe/reliable.  Therefore, a warning *would* be given *not* to drink the water.

Let's look at why the other options are warnings found *in* the passage:

* **A: Yuunitiiwwan qilleensa galchuuf oolan itti fayyadamuu dhiisuu** - While not directly stated, the mention of ""haaromsituu qilleensaa cufaa"" (contaminated air) implies a warning to avoid air filtration units that might spread the contamination.
* **B: Mana keessa turuu** - The passage says officials urged residents to ""mana akka turan akeekkachisan"" (stay indoors).
* **C: Aara adii gara keessatti fudhachuu dhiisuu** - The passage starts by mentioning the television broadcasting a warning about the radiation leak (""Gabaasaaleen Televiziyoonii aarri adiin ijaarsicha keessaa dhufaa akka jiru argisiisu"").



Therefore, the only option *not* represented as a warning in the text is avoiding drinking the water."
"Akkaataa Dr. Moolitti, waa’ee XDR-TB waanti baay’ee yaaddessaan maalidha?","Correct answer: **C: Namni qabame tokko lakkoofsa namoota inni qabsiisuu danda’uu**

Here's why:

The passage states Dr. Mool is concerned about the ""new strain… highly infectious and frightening, due to the rapid rate of mortality."" He then goes on to explain that one infected person can infect 10-15 people within a year. This clearly indicates his primary concern is the *infectiousness* and *spread* of the XDR-TB, specifically how many people one infected person can infect.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vaayirantii hospitaala keessatti nama qabaa jiru** - While the hospital workers being infected is mentioned, it's a *result* of the concern, not the concern itself.
*   **B: Vaayirantichi qoricha baruu isaa** - The passage says it's a new strain, but doesn't focus on *how* it became resistant.
*   **D: Hanga inni ajjeesu** - The high mortality rate is mentioned, but the speed of spread is highlighted as the more frightening aspect.



"
Namoota dhibicha ykn vaayiraantidhaan qabaman keessaa meeqaa isaanitu ogeeyyii fayyaati?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Dr. Mool akka yaadaniti, fi yoo xiqqaate lamaan isaanii hojjetoota fayyaa Hospitaala turani."" which translates to ""...Dr. Mool believes, and at least two of them were hospital healthcare workers."" 

Therefore, at least two of the infected individuals were healthcare workers."
Sistamni NextGen teeknolojii akkamii fayyadama?,"The correct answer is **A: Teeknolojii saatalaayitii irratti hundaa’e** (Technology based on satellite).

The passage explicitly states: ""Teekinolojii Sataalayitii irratti hunda’u fayyadamaa..."" (It uses technology based on satellites...). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Teeknolojii baay’ee ammayyaa (precision technology)** - While NextGen likely *is* precise, the passage doesn't highlight precision as its foundational technology.
* **C: Teeknolojii raadarii lafarra jirurratti hundaa’e (Technology based on land radar)** - The passage contrasts NextGen with older ""teekinoolojii lafa irra radarii"" (land radar technology), indicating it *doesn't* rely on that.
* **D: Teeknolojii karban emishinii (Carbon emission technology)** - The passage mentions carbon emissions as a *result* of current aviation, not as the basis of NextGen's technology.



"
NextGen akkamitti kanneen geejjiba qilleensarraa to’atan gargaara?,"The correct answer is **B: Bakka argama balalii baay’ee sirrii ta’e** (Very accurate aircraft location).

Here's why:

The passage states that NextGen uses satellite technology to ""sirritti bakka xiyyaarri jiran sirritti himu"" - accurately determine aircraft locations. This is crucial for air traffic controllers to guide planes, especially during challenging weather conditions.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Daandiwwan balalii gabaabaa (Shorter flight paths)** – While NextGen *aims* to enable shorter paths, the passage doesn't state it *directly* helps with weather avoidance. It's a consequence of better technology.
* **C: Kaarban emishinii gadi bu’e (Reduced carbon emissions)** – The passage mentions reduced emissions as a *result* of NextGen, but not as a way it helps with weather.
* **D: Boba’aa xiqqaa (Less delay)** –  Again, this is a potential benefit, but not how it specifically addresses weather.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, FBI irratti xiyyeeffachuu dhiisuusaaf kan qorattoonni seenaa qeeqan maalidha?","The correct answer is **B: Yakkoota salphaatti dhorkamuu danda’aniif bajata ramaduu**.

Here's why:

The passage states that historians believe the FBI focuses on easier cases (""dhimmoota salphaati furamuu danda’aniif"") to justify funding and increase the agency’s success rate (""yaada milkaa’ina ejansiicha ol kaasuf""). This aligns directly with option B – allocating budget to easily solved crimes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hanga milkaa’ina isaanii guddisuu** - While increasing success is *a result* of focusing on easier cases, it's not the *reason* historians believe they do it.
*   **C: Dhimmoota fiilmiwwan saal-qunnamtii irratti xiyyeeffannoo guddaa kennuu** - The passage mentions ""ga’eessotaatiif"" (criminals) but doesn't say they focus specifically on film-related crimes.
*   **D: Dhimmoota konkolaataa hatamanii** - This is mentioned as an example of the types of cases, but not the overall reason for the FBI's approach.



"
Inisheetiivin waanta safuu gatee FBI maal akka godhu dirqisiisa?,"The correct answer is **A: Dhimmoota konkolaataa hatamaniif risoorsii ykn bajata heddu ramaduu** (Allocate more resources or budget to stolen vehicle cases).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kanneen seenaa beekan qeeqaniiru seerotaa FBI qabeenya irratti xiyyeeffachu isaaniif, keessumaa waa’ee makiinawwan haatamanii..."" This directly translates to ""Those who know the history are questioning the FBI’s focus on property crimes, especially regarding stolen vehicles...""
* **The passage also says:** ""Koongireesiin bara bajataa 2005 keessa hojii safuun keessa hinjirrerratti maallaqa dhangalaasuu eegale..."" This means Congress started urging the FBI to spend money on vehicle theft cases.

Therefore, the initiative compels the FBI to dedicate more resources (funding) to stolen vehicle cases.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hanga milkaa’ina ejansichaa guddisuu** (To increase the agency's success) - While the FBI *wants* to increase its success, this isn't what the initiative directly *requires* them to do.
* **C: Yakkoota salphaatti furaman irratti xiyyeeffachuu** (Focus on easily solvable cases) - The passage actually suggests the opposite - vehicle theft cases are *not* necessarily easy to solve.
* **D: Ejantoonni dhimmoota fiilmii saal-qunnamtii irratti dhimmanii akka hojjatan gochuu** (To have agents work on movie-style crimes) - This is not mentioned in the passage. The focus is specifically on vehicle theft.

* **The passage states:** ""Gripen JAS 39C karaa ka’uumsa bira naannoo sa’aatii biyya keessaa ganama keessaa 9.30(0230 UTC) tti kufee dhohe...""  This directly translates to ""The Gripen JAS 39C crashed near...""

    * **B: Ni garagale** (It was understood) - Doesn't relate to the event described.
    * **D: Boba’aa fixate** (The problem was fixed) - This implies a successful resolution, but the passage indicates a crash.

Therefore, the passage clearly states the JAS 39C Gripen *crashed* (dhohe)."
"JAS 39C Girpin caccabuu hordofee, buufanni xayyaarichaa kamiif cufaa ta’e?","The correct answer is **A: Balalii daldalaa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""buufata xiyyaarichaas **balalii daladalaa’tti cufan**."" This directly translates to ""the aircraft's fuselage was covered in **commercial debris**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Konkolaattota ittisa balaa abiddaa:** The text mentions *konkolaattota* (groups) but specifies they were responding to the incident, not what the plane was covered in.
* **C: Miidiyaa naannoo:** The text mentions local media *reporting* on the event, not being the debris covering the plane.
* **D: Gaggeessitoota iskuwaadiroonii:** The text identifies the pilot, but doesn't say they were what the plane was covered in.

The text states: ""Akka NSA’ti, Kartariin gargaare adeemsa waraaqsa Iraan, kan gara qabiinsa Iraanitti kaas, 1979;"" This translates to ""As NSA, Carter assisted the process of the Iranian hostage crisis, which led to the Iranian capture, 1979."" 

Therefore, Carter was involved in the process leading up to the Iran hostage crisis. The question asks who supported or guided the Iranian hostage crisis, and the text clearly states it was Carter.



"
Haaga bara 1977 tti aangoo Gorsaa Nageenya Biyyaalessaa eenyutu qabatee ture?,"The correct answer is **C: Kaartar**.

The text states: ""akka Gorsaa Nageenya Biyyoolessaatti (NSA) 1977 hanga 1981 tti Heenrii Kiisiinjeriin bakka bu’uudhaan tajaajile."" This means Carter held the position of National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981, before being replaced by Henry Kissinger.

Therefore, the answer is Carter."
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa turtii Boobek Partizan Beelgireed waliin qabu sirriitti kan hin ibsine kami?,"Correct answer is **A: Yeroo garichaaf taphatu galchii 468 ol lakkoofsiseera**.

Here's why:

The passage states Boobeek scored *403* goals in 468 appearances, not more than 468. The other options are all directly supported by the text:

*   **B:** The text states ""Eenyuyyuu Boobeekii alatti gonkumaa Dandeetti jabaa yookaan goolii bayyee kilabichaaf hin galmeesisne"" (No one besides Boobeek scored as many goals for the club).
*   **C:** The text explicitly states he was chosen as the best player in Partizan's history in 1995.
*   **D:** While not directly stating he played the *most* games, 468 appearances is a significant number, suggesting he participated in many matches."
Seenaa Boobek kilaba Paartizan Beelgireed wajjin qabu ilaalchisee hima kamtu dhugaadha?,"Lakkoofsa A kan dhugaadha. Kana booda ibsa keessatti, ""Inni bara 1945 isaanitti makamee hanga 1958 achi ture"" jechuun ibsanii jiru.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, amala kamtu Hesperonikas velooseraptar irraa adda godha?","The correct answer is **A: Miila lama qaba** (It has two legs).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""kan dhiigi isaa kunakka veelookiraaptorii ol jedhee **miilla lamaan deemaa ture** jedhamee amanama."" This directly translates to ""it was believed to walk on **two legs** like Velociraptor.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Qeensa lammaffaa guddaa qaba** (Has a large second claw) - The passage mentions a large second claw (Heesperooniikas - ""Second Claw""), but this isn't what *distinguishes* it from Velociraptor, as Velociraptors also had a prominent second claw.
* **C: Qaama guutummaatti rifeensan haguugame qaba** (Has a fully feathered body) - The passage mentions it was fully covered in feathers, but this doesn't highlight a difference from Velociraptor (many paleontologists believe Velociraptors also had feathers).
* **D: Dhiigni ykn teempireechara qaamaa hoo’aa qaba (warm blooded)** (Has warm blood) - The passage doesn't discuss whether it was warm-blooded.



"
Hiikni jecha “Hesperonikas” qaama gosa bineensotaa kam irraa dhufe?,"The correct answer is **D: Ilkaan (beak)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""maqaa Heesperooniikas jedhu kan, hiiki isaa “Qoronyoo lixaa” ta’e kennuufiidhaan."" This translates to ""the name Hesperonikas, its meaning being given as 'six crowns' (referring to its beak)."" 

Therefore, the meaning of ""Hesperonikas"" comes from its beak, specifically the idea of it having six crown-like structures.



"
Waa’ee dhukaasichaa ilaalchisee himoota armaan gadii keessa kamtu dhugaadha?,"Correct answer: **C: Abbaan warraafi haati warraa waggaa tokko dura Bufaalotti wal fuudhan**

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Cimdootni sun wagga tokko dura Teeksaas keessatti wal fuudhanii hiriyootaa fi firoottan isaanii wajjin ayyaaneffachuf gara Baafaloo dhufan."" (The victims met in Texas a year ago and came to Buffalo to celebrate with friends and family).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Abbbaan warraafi haati warraa lamaan isaanituu Teeksas irraayi** - The text doesn’t say both parents were from Texas, only that the victims met in Texas.
*   **B: Namoota shantu miidhame** - The text mentions four people were killed.
*   **D: Dhukaasi Bufaalotti mudate** - The text says the victims came *to* Buffalo, it doesn't state the shooting happened there. It only mentions the father was born in Buffalo."
Waa’ee taatee bakka dhukaasi itti raawwatee ilaalchisee himni sirriin kami?,"Lakkoofsa A kan sirrii dha. Maqaan dubbii keessatti, sagantaan kabaja ayyaana waggaa Bufaaloo keessatti mudate jedhame kan ibsame.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, waa’ee Luno ilaalchisee aangawoota gidduutti shakkiin ykn yaaddon jalqabaa maal ture?","Correct answer is **B: Dambaliifi bubbee guddaa**.

Here's why:

The text states Lunaan was dropped into the water with a ""qilleensa guddaafi dambaliidhaan"" (large damage and debris). The initial concern of the divers was whether they could *reduce* this debris from the boat.  This indicates their first thought was the significant damage and debris surrounding Luna.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hanqina kaargoo xaa’oo (Lack of cargo leak):** The text mentions a desire to avoid leaks, but it wasn't the initial concern.
*   **C: Dhangala’uu boba’aa (Bobbing volume):** While the volume (120-160 cubic meters) is mentioned, it wasn’t the first thought of the divers.
*   **D: Miidhama miseensota garee irra gahe (Damage to the helicopter crew):** The text only states the helicopter had a team and one member was injured; it doesn’t imply this was the *initial* concern regarding Luna.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, himoota armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee cabuu Luno ilaalchisee kan dhugaa hin taane kami?","The correct answer is **B: Yeroo cabu markabichi boba’aa meetira 100 qabatee ture.**

Here's why:

The passage states the ship had a volume of 120-160 cubic meters, *not* 100 meters. It mentions a 100-meter distance from the shore, but that’s about the ship’s location relative to the shore, not its size.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the text:

*   **A: Cabuun kan mudate osoo kaargoo hin kaasin dura** - The passage implies the ship sunk before it could be emptied (it was filled with a large amount of material).
*   **C: Miseensota garichaa kudha lama keesaa tokkotu miidhame** - The passage explicitly says, ""isaan keessaa miidhaan qaqabee caba funyaanii qofa"" which means one of the two groups of divers was lost.
*   **D: Markabichi gara qarqara bishaanitti dhiibame** - The passage states it was sunk into the lake (""gara ittisa bishaanii keessatti dhiibame"").



"
Aljeeriyaan jaarraa meeqaffaa keessa walabummaa argatte?,"The correct answer is **C: 1960 oota**.

The text states: ""Bara 1960moota keessa gara biyya haaraa bilisummaa argatte Aljeeriyaatti deebi’e..."" which translates to ""In the 1960s, he returned to newly independent Algeria..."""
Sirna awwaalchatiif iskiriiniin televizhiinii eessatti hin kaa’amin?,"The correct answer is **D: Adda babahii St. Piitar (St. Peter's Square)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that due to the large number of people, *nobody* could get close to the first Mass *at St. Peter's Square* (Addababayii Qulqulluu Pheexiroos). Large screens were set up *in rooms* to allow people to watch. This implies the Mass itself wasn't broadcast *on* screens *in* St. Peter's Square, but *viewed on screens elsewhere* because people couldn't physically be there.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Guutummaa Room (All of Rome):** Screens were set up *in rooms* within Rome, but not the entire city was without access.
*   **B: Magaalota Xaaliyaanee heddu keessa (In many Italian cities):** Similar events happened in other Italian cities and internationally, but the passage specifically mentions the difficulty of access *to the first Mass*.
*   **C: Pooland keessa bakkeewwan muraasa (In some places in Poland):** While similar gatherings happened in Poland, the passage doesn't link a screen ban to Poland.



"
Sirni awwaalchaa eessatti gaggeeffame?,"The correct answer is **D: Jalqaba Room keessatti, sana booda magaalota Xaaliyaanii biroo keessatti**.

Here's why:

* The text states the initial event was in Rome (""Addababayii Qulqulluu Pheexiroositti"").
* It then mentions similar demonstrations happened in other Italian cities (""Magaalota Xaaliyaanii kan biroo hedduu kessattii"") and even internationally (""addunyaa hafte irrattis, keessattuu Poolaandii keessa""). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Guutummaa Room bakkeewwan heddutti:** While it happened in many places in Rome, it wasn't *only* in Rome.
* **B: Pooland keessatti:** Poland was mentioned, but as a location where it *also* happened, not where it started.
* **C: Adda babahii St. Piitar:** While likely near there, the text doesn't specify the event was *only* at St. Peter's Basilica.



"
"Dhohiinsa hordofee, miidhamni cimaan mudatee eenyutu yaalame?","The correct answer is **A: Yoo xiqqaate namoota shan** (At least five people).

Here's why:

The text states: ""garuu yoo xiqqaate namootni shan yeroo dho’iinsaatti achi turan mallattoo ofwallaalanii-kufuutiif wal’aanamaniru."" This directly translates to ""however, at least five people who were there at the time of the collapse were found showing signs of suffocation.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Homtinuu** (Nobody) - The text clearly states at least five people were affected.
*   **C: Angawaa kampanii boba’aa** (The company's owner) - The text doesn't mention the owner being injured.
*   **D: Ollaa** (The gas company's leader) - The text mentions the leader gave statements *before* the collapse, not that they were injured *because* of it.



"
Dhangala’uu gaazii ykn boba’aa eenyutu gabaase?,"The correct answer is **C: Ogeessa kampanii boba’ichaa** (The company’s gas expert).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hoogganaan kaampaanii gaasii erga ollaan waa’ee mul’annoo yaa’uu gaasii bilibilan booda taatee sana gabaasaa ture."" (The company’s leader reported it after the gas expert had noticed the gas leak.) This directly indicates the gas expert discovered and reported the gas leak.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ollaa gamicha keessa jiru** (People in the building) - They were *affected* by the leak, not the ones who reported it.
*   **B: Nama apaartimenticha keessa jiraaatu** (Residents of the apartment) - They weren’t the ones who initially discovered the leak.
*   **D: Hogganaa gamoo sanaa** (The building's manager) - They reported *after* being informed by the gas expert.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, haleellichaan namoota meeqatu du’e?","The correct answer is **A: 4**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kanneen du’an Nikoolaas Aalden, 25, fi Zaakarii Cuddeback, 21."" (Nikolaas Aalden, 25, and Zakari Cuddeback, 21 died).  It also mentions Edgar Veguye and Kristoffer Schneider were *attempted* to be murdered, but not confirmed dead. Finally, it mentions a fifth person's mind was accessed, but not stated they died.

Therefore, only two people are explicitly stated as having died in the text. However, the text later states that the attacker was attempting to kill Kristoffer Schneider in addition to the two already mentioned, as well as another victim, totaling four intended victims. Since the question asks about *those who died* and the text mentions the attacker attempted to kill two more, the answer is four.



"
Yeroo haleellan gaggeeffamu sana meeshaa eenyutu dhukaasuu dide?,"The correct answer is **C: Shinaayidar**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Meeshaan waraanaa Yuukaa wayita sammuu nama shanaffaatti aggaamametti argachuu hin dandeenye."" (The war machine of Yukon was not found in the fifth person's brain).  It then says, ""Shiinayideer...toora viidiyootiin seenuun waayee USAF biyya dhalootaasaa taa’uun dhugaa bawumsa laateera."" (Shinaayider...revealed the truth about being a USAF native through video footage).

This implies Shinaayider had access to and revealed information about the war machine (Yukon), and therefore would be the one refusing to disclose it during questioning (""yeroo haleellan gaggeeffamu sana meeshaa eenyutu dhukaasuu dide?"" - ""Who refused to reveal the machine during interrogation?"").



"
Gosa ispoortii armaan gadii keessaa sagantaa Olompikii keessaa akka bahu godhame kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Iskuwaashii**.

The passage states: ""Iskuwaashiin, kaaraateenii fi rooleriin ispoortota akkuma beezboolii fi sooftibooli sagantaa Oolompikii keessa galuuf yaalaa turanii filannoodhaan Taphoora Olompiikii 2005 tii ala akka ta’an taasifamanidha"" which translates to ""Squash, karate and rollersports, like baseball and softball, were trying to enter the Olympic program but were decided to be excluded from the 2005 Olympic Games.""

Therefore, squash was decided to be excluded."
Ispoortiwwan armaan gadii keessaa Koreen Olompikii Idila-addunyaa taphicha keessatti akka hammatamu kan godhe kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Raagbii yuuniyeenii**.

The text states: ""Ragbii, keessumaa yuuniyeniin ragbii, akkasumaaas golfiin taphoota biroo shankeessaa akka ispoortii Oolompikiitti dabalamaniif filataman."" (Rugby, especially union rugby, as well as golf and other sports were selected to be added as Olympic sports.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Roolarispoortii (Roller sports)** - The text says roller sports were *not* selected for inclusion.
*   **B: Kubbaa kachoo (Baseball)** - The text says baseball and softball were trying to get *into* the Olympics but were rejected.
*   **D: Sooftboolii (Softball)** -  Same as baseball, it was rejected.



"
Artar Giinas St Jeems Geet Biriwarii jalqaba waggaa meeqaf liizii godhe?,"The correct answer is **C: 1759**.

The text states ""Fulbaana 24, 1759, Artar Giinas Ayerlaandi, Daabliinitti Biiraa Geetsi St Jamsiif sanada waggaa 9,000 mallatteessan."" This means Arthur Guinness signed a 9,000 year lease for the St. James's Gate brewery in 1759.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 250** - This refers to the number of years *after* 1759 that Guinness became a global business.
*   **B: 10** - This refers to Guinness's current worth in billions of Euros.
*   **D: 9000** - This is the length of the lease, not the year it was signed.



"
Giinas waggaa waggaan dolaara biiliyoona hangam ta’u fida ykn galcha?,"The correct answer is **D: 10**.

The passage states that Guinness will be worth €10 billion (US$14.7 billion) *annually* (waggaa waggaan) after 250 years. The question asks how many *billion dollars* Guinness will make or earn annually. The passage directly states $14.7 billion, which is closest to 10 (representing the €10 billion)."
Vaayirasiin H5N1 biyyoota Gamtaa Awurrooppaa meeqa keessatti mul’ate?,"The correct answer is **C: Torba**.

The text states: ""Faransaay vaayirasii kanaan rakkachuudhaaf Gamtaa Awurooppaa keessaa biyya torbaffaadha; Oostiriyaa, Jarmanii, Silooveeniyaa, Bulgaariiyaa, Giriikii fi Xaaliyaaniitti aantee."" This translates to: ""France is the seventh country in Europe affected by this virus; it has spread to Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Italy.""

Therefore, including France, the virus has appeared in seven European countries."
Keezin H5N1 inni dhiyeenyaa eessatti argame?,"The correct answer is **A: Faransaayi** (France).

The text states: ""...gaafa Wiixataa caffee Liyoonitti dhiyoo Faransaay bahaa keessaa keessatti argame..."" which translates to ""...was found in a cafe in Lyon, eastern France..."". This clearly indicates the origin of the H5N1 case is France.



"
Osoo loltoonni nagaa eegdotaa hin daddabarsin dura Haaitin yeroo dhumaaf yoom dhibichi keessatti argame?,"The correct answer is **A: 1800 oota**.

The text states: ""Osoo loltootni hin ga’iin dura, Haayitiim rakkootu mudatee dhukkubaa waliin wal qabachuun ergaa bara 1800 tii."" This translates to ""Before the cholera was brought by the peacekeepers, Haiti had last experienced an outbreak of the disease dating back to the 1800s."" 

Therefore, the last time Haiti experienced the disease before the peacekeepers was in the 1800s.



"
Bakka kam gara lixaatti argamutu dhibichi akka babal’atuuf gumaache?,"The correct answer is **A: Laga Artibonaayit**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""akka himata seeraatti, balfii kaampii mootumoota gamtoomanii irraa sirriitti hin qulqulloofne, Laga Aartiboonii laga guddaa haayitti keessa isa tokko kan ta’e yaa’utti akka baakteeriyaan seenuf sababa ta’eera."" (According to the report, untreated wastewater from UN peacekeeping camps was believed to have been discharged into the Artibonite River, one of Haiti's largest rivers, introducing bacteria.)

This directly links the Artibonite River to the spread of the cholera outbreak.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kaampii Mootummoota Gamtoomanii:** While the camps were the *source* of the contamination, the river was the *vehicle* for its spread.
*   **C: Bakka kirkirri lafaa 2010 itti mudate:** The earthquake created a humanitarian crisis, but the river is what allowed the bacteria to spread widely.
*   **D: Inistitiyuutii Haqaa fi Dimokiraasii Haayitii:** This organization conducted research, it didn't cause the spread of the disease.



"
Mootummaan Ayirish maal hojjachuuf karoorsaa jira?,"The correct answer is **C: Hayyamamuu qoricha sammuu adoochuu ilaalchisee seerota laaffisuu**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Irish government is considering amending the law regarding ""wantoota sammuu adoochan keessatti hirmaatanii fi amanamummaa qoricha waliin walqabtan"" (things related to drug use and trustworthiness concerning a conviction). The Minister of Health expressed a position after recent changes to the law. This strongly suggests they are reviewing and potentially *changing* the laws around drug use.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Warreen yakka qoricha sammuu adoochun shakkamanitti murtii dabarsuu** - The text doesn't mention dismissing cases, only reviewing laws.
*   **B: Qorichi sammuu adoochu hayyamamuu ilaalchisee seerota caalmatti cimoo ta’an baasuu** - The passage suggests *changing* laws, not making them stricter.
*   **D: Qoricha sammuu adoochu yakkarraa bilisa gochuu** - The text focuses on legal changes and doesn't mention decriminalization.



"
Ayarlaand keessatti maaltu yerodhaaf hayyamamaadha?,"The correct answer is **D: Qoricha sammuu adoochu** (Using performance-enhancing drugs).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Miniisteerri fayyaa nagenyummaa namoota bu'aa yeroo seeraa fudhatani wantoota sammuu adoochan keessatti hirmaatanii fi amanamummaa qoricha waliin walqabtan fi qabataman erga jijjiiramootni haaraan heeraa-alaa bahee booda ta'aniif yaaddoo isaa mul'isee jira.""  This translates to: ""The Ministry of Health has expressed its concern regarding the participation of athletes in performance-enhancing drugs and the associated issues of integrity and doping after recent legal changes.""

Therefore, the topic being discussed and potentially legislated on in Ireland is the use of performance-enhancing drugs.



"
Namni yakkaan shakkame maal irratti qorannoon irratti gaggeeffamaa jira?,"The correct answer is **A: Seera cabsuu (Breaking the law)**.

Here's why:

The text states Kiristoofer Garshiyaa was arrested ""sababa gidduu seeneef"" which translates to ""for a reason in between,"" but the context clearly indicates he's being investigated for a crime. The rest of the description focuses on his identification (marks on his body) and how he's being identified - not *what* he's accused of.  The overarching situation points to a legal issue and breaking the law.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Miidhaa qaamaa (Physical harm):** The text says his body isn't physically harmed (""Mallattoon isaa qaamaan hin miidhaamne""), so this is incorrect.
*   **C: Mancaasuu (Robbery):** There's no mention of theft or robbery.
*   **D: Hanna (Killing):** There's no mention of murder or killing.



"
"Yeroo mallatttoo jijjiiru (altering the sign), shakkamaan maal gochuu hin qabu ture?","The correct answer is **A: Qubeewwan isaa keessaa tokko jijjiiruu** (Changing one of its letters).

Here's why:

The text states the sign was altered by changing a small ""e"" to an ""O"" using roofing material. This directly implies that *a letter* within the sign was changed. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mallattoo nagaa (peace sign) dhaan bakka buusuu** (Replacing it with a peace sign) - The text doesn't mention replacing the sign, just altering it.
* **C: Miidhaa irraan gahuu** (To be physically damaged) - The text specifically states the sign wasn't physically damaged.
* **D: Haaressuuf waan akka sharaa (tarpaulins) fayyadamuu** (Using things like tarpaulins for covering) - This refers to *how* the alteration was done (using roofing material), not what the alteration *was*.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa barsiisan Ingiliffaa Koornon kan hin himatamneef kami?","The correct answer is **A: Mirga koppii raayitii hatuu (The right to hold copyright)**.

Here's why:

The passage details several accusations against the professor:

*   **C: Beeksisa hayyama hin qabne maxxansuu (Publishing unauthorized notices):** The passage states the school requested he stop ""maxing a significant influence on expenses"" without authorization.
*   **D: Daree keessatti jechoota safuu cabsan dubbachuu (Using offensive language in the classroom):** The passage specifically says he ""used derogatory language in lectures"" and ""spoke only in a defined tribal language in lectures.""
*   **B: Barataa kaadhimmachuu (Favoring students):** The passage hints at this with the large number of students (9,000) and the observation that his concerns were viewed ""as pedagogical"" and his language use was ""justified.""

However, there is *no mention* of him being accused of copyright infringement or improperly holding copyright. Therefore, **A** is the correct answer."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, Rolaandoo Mendoozadhaan kan uggurmane eenyu ture?","The correct answer is **A: Tursitoota** (Tourists).

The passage clearly states: ""Rolando Mendoza kan ta’ee qawwee isaa gara Tuuristiiti dhukaase."" This translates to ""Rolando Mendoza, fired his gun at the tourists."" 

Therefore, Rolando Mendoza targeted and harmed the tourists."
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’un, namoota ugguraman keessaa kanneen dursaniii bahuunsaanii kan hin mirkanoofne kami?","Correct answer is **B: Warra jaarrolee**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states deaths have been *confirmed* for some, but the exact number is not yet known. It also mentions:

*   **Tourists** were taken hostage.
*   **Those taking photos** (suura kaasan) were used as bargaining chips, and a photographer was shot.
*   **Children** were among those being used as bargaining chips.

However, the text *does not* mention any injuries or deaths among the police (warra jaarrolee). Therefore, we cannot confirm any injuries/deaths to them based on the given passage."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, Biraazil keessatti gaa’illi saala wal-fakkaata seera qabeessa akka ta’u deeggaruuf eenyutu mallattoo walitti qabaa jira?","The correct answer is **A: Mormitoota (The protesters)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that protesters have collected 1.2 million signatures to petition Congress to legalize same-sex civil unions. This clearly indicates they are the ones actively pushing for the legal recognition of same-sex relationships in Brazil.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Robeertoo Jefersan (Roberto Jafersan):** He is currently reviewing the bill, but not actively advocating for it.
*   **C: Waldaa Rooman Kaatolikii (The Roman Catholic Church):** The passage states the church *opposed* legalization.
*   **D: Maartaa Saplisii (Marta Saplisii):** She prepared the initial draft of the bill long ago, but isn't currently driving the effort.



"
Mormitoonni iyyata isaanii eenyutti kennu?,"The correct answer is **B: Robeertoo Jefersan**.

Here's why:

The passage states the revised law is currently ""in the hands of Roberto Jafersan."" The protesters are hoping to submit a petition with 1.2 million signatures to Congress, but the *law itself* is with Roberto Jafersan. Therefore, they are directing their complaint/protest regarding the law *to him*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waldaa Rooman Kaatolikii (The Roman Catholic Church):** While the church's previous stance is mentioned, the current issue is with the law and the person handling it.
*   **C: Mana Maree Biyyaalessaa Biraazil (Brazilian Congress):** The protesters *intend* to submit a petition to Congress, but they aren't currently directing their complaint *to* Congress regarding the law’s current status.
*   **D: Kantiibaa Saa’o Pooloo (Sao Paulo's Draft):** This refers to the original draft of the law, not the current holder of the revised version.

"Akkaataa ragaa Armand Versaasitti, osoo namoonni walitti qabaman haala qilleensatti miira isaanii hin agarsiisin dura kallattiidhan maaltu mudate?","The correct answer is **A: Cabbii buusuu eegale**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*sana booda roobni dhufe, garuu baayee cimaa fi baayee guddaa kan gogaa kee raasu, Sana booda cabbiin samii irraa bu’ee, namootni wal lolaan akkasuma iyyaa walirra figaan.*""

This translates to: ""...then rain came, very heavy and large enough to soak you, then lightning started falling from the sky, and people started fighting and injuring each other.""

The text explicitly states that lightning (cabbii) began *after* the heavy rain, and *before* the people started fighting. Therefore, the lightning is what happened immediately before the chaos began.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Agarsiisichi daqiiqaa shan boodatti hafee gaggeeffamaa ture** - This refers to the initial speed increase but isn't related to the events leading up to the fighting.
*   **C: Bubbee cimaatu ture** - While the rain was heavy, the *lightning* is the event directly preceding the fighting.
*   **D: Bakka miseensi maatii jiran dhabe** - This refers to his sister and friend being lost, not something that triggered the chaos.

"Akka versaasitti, bubbee cimaan yoom eegale?","The correct answer is **B: Rooba booda**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...sana booda roobni dhufe, garuu baayee cimaa fi baayee guddaa kan gogaa kee raasu..."" This directly translates to ""...then rain came, but very strong and very big to ruin your mood...""  Therefore, the strong rain (bubbee cimaa) started *after* the rain began.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Agarsiisichi eegalee daqiiqaa muraasa booda** - The text mentions something happening after a few minutes, but doesn't connect that to the rain.
*   **C: Obboleettii isaa erga dhabee booda** - While he mentions losing his sister, the text doesn't link that to the rain.
*   **D: Osoo cabbiin hin bu’in dura** - The text states the rain came *before* the chaos (""cabbiin samii irraa bu'ee, namootni wal lolaan..."")"
"Fireed dura, bubbeewwan ciccimaa meeqatu baha 35°W tti galmaa’e?","The correct answer is **D: Tokko**.

The text states: ""Fireed obomboleettii tirooppikaalaa cimaa durarraa gara kibbaatti galmaa’eedha akkasumas Atilaantik bahaa keessatti jalqabuu suuraa saatalaayitii irraa eegalee, fi **sadarkaa sadaffaarra kan jiru Heerikeen qofaatu** gara bahaatti 35°W galmeesse.""

This means only one storm (the hurricane) has reached 35°W.
"
"Yeroo Fireed dhiyeenya oddoola Keep Vardeetti argame, kallattii kamitti deemaa ture?","The correct answer is **B: Kibb**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Fireed obomboleettii tirooppikaalaa cimaa durarraa gara **kibbaatti** galmaa’eedha..."" (Fireed moved from the strong tropical cyclone towards the **south**...).

Therefore, when Fireed was identified near the Keep Verdetti oil platform, it was moving south.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kan isa duraa caalaa saffisa caalu kan qabu kami?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that 802.11n has a higher speed than 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g (""Saffisawwan 802.11n kan isaan dura turan, kanneen saffisi isaanii ol-aanaan sekoondiitti meeggaabiitii 600 ta’e caalaa saffisa guddaa qabu."").  The other options are either repetitions of 802.11n or are slower standards (802.11a).



"
802.11b wajjin duubatti deebi’ee kan wal-faana deemu ta’uuf 802.11n dhaaf maaltu murteessadha?,"Correct answer is **D: Duwaal raadiyoo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that 802.11n ""provides dual-band radio capability, allowing it to operate on both the 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz bands"" and that it is backwards compatible with older standards like 802.11b.  This ability to operate on both frequencies and still work with older devices is due to the **dual radio** design. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Saffisa cimaa (Higher Speed)** - While 802.11n *has* higher speed, this isn't what makes it backward compatible. Compatibility is about being able to *talk* to older devices, not just being faster.
*   **B: 802.11b dandeettii 5.0Ghz irratti hojjachuuf qabu (802.11b's ability to operate on 5.0Ghz)** - 802.11b *cannot* operate on 5.0Ghz. 802.11n allows communication *with* 802.11b devices despite that limitation.
*   **C: 600Mbit/s tti hanga odeeffannoo (Data up to 600Mbit/s)** - This refers to the *speed* of 802.11n, not its compatibility with older standards.



"
Dorgommiiwwan Komonweelz irratti namni dorgommii Olompikii irratti warqee mo’ate sagantaalee (events) meeqa bishaan daakuu qaba ture?,"The correct answer is **B: Sadi**.

Here's why:

The passage states the athlete was preparing to compete in the 100m and 200m swimming events at the Olympics and Commonwealth Games. That's two events explicitly mentioned. The question asks about *swimming* events at the Commonwealth Games for an Olympic medalist. A typical Commonwealth Games swimming program includes a 100m, 200m, *and* another event (like a 50m freestyle or a medley) for a swimmer of that caliber. Therefore, the most logical answer is three.
"
Namni dorgommii Olompikii irratti warqee mo’ate sun maalif dhukkubbii itti dhagahamuuf qoricha hin fudhanne?,"The correct answer is **A: Dhukkubbii hin qabu ture**.

Here's why:

The passage states the athlete was prevented from competing in the Olympics *because* of questions about his physical fitness due to a complaint. It also says he couldn't take the necessary tests to prove his fitness because he was excluded from the Games. This implies he wasn't actually sick; the issue was about *proving* he was fit to compete despite the complaint.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dhukkubbiin akka itti dhagamu godhe:** The passage doesn't say he *caused* a sickness.
* **C: Dandeettii qaama (fitness) isaarratti dhiibbaa negatiiva ta’e qabaata jedhee yaadda’ee ture:** This is speculation and isn't supported by the text. The issue was about *proving* his fitness, not his belief about it.
* **D: Dorgommiiwwan Komanweelz irratti hin hayyamamu:** The passage focuses on the Olympics, not Commonwealth Games.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, waa’ee kirikira lafaa maaltu burjaajif nama saaxilee ture?","The correct answer is **A: Duumessi gurraachi mul’achuu** (The appearance of smoke).

Here's why:

* The passage states ""Duumessa dukkana kan voolkaanoo waliin walitti hidhata hin qabne akka waan bu’uuraa gaaraatti gabaafame. Duumessichi dhoohiinsi sirriin raawwatee turuu fi dhiisuu isaatiif shakkiin akka inni uumamu taasise."" This directly translates to ""Dark smoke was reported as coming from the ground. The smoke created uncertainty about whether emissions were continuing or stopping."" 

The passage indicates the smoke (duumessi) was the thing that alerted people and caused concern. The other options aren't the direct cause of the alert:

* **B:** While the Meteorological Office (Biiroo Meetiroolojii) issued a statement, it was *because* of the smoke, not the statement itself, that people were concerned.
* **C:** The maps didn't show activity, so they weren't the source of the alarm.
* **D:** Reports from local areas (taatewwan naannolee) would likely *include* observations of the smoke.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, jijjiirran sadarkaa yoom mudate?","The correct answer is **A: Bitootessa 10 dura**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sochiin inni guddaan kirkira lafaa kan sadarkaa jijjiiruu taasise Bitooteessa 10 kaaba bahaa bantii volkaanoo kaalderaa irratti ta’e.""  This translates to ""The major seismic activity that caused a change in level occurred on November 10th on the caldera volcano rim.""  ""Dura"" means ""before"" in Oromo, so it happened *before* November 10th.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sa’aatii 48 darbe keessatti** - This refers to the period where no activity was detected around Heekla, not the change in level.
* **C: Bitootessa gaafa 10** - The text says it happened *on* November 10th, not *at* November 10th. Also, it refers to it happening *before* November 10th.
* **D: Torbee isa duraa keessa** - The text mentions this timeframe in relation to a previous mapping, but not the change in level.



"
Waa’ee konkolaataa hawaa Chandrayaan-1’s ilaalchisee himoota armaan gadii keessaa kamtu dhugaa miti?,"The correct answer is **A: Orbitarri konklaataa hawaa (probe) nama of keessaa qaba ture** (The spacecraft's orbiter had a human inside it).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""mankuraakuriin ji’a qorattu sun fakkii alaabaa biyyaalessaa Indiyaa, kan kallattiiwwan hundaan itti dibame illee ofirraa qabdi."" This means the orbiter took pictures *from* orbit and was unmanned (ofirraa qabdi = it held itself/was self-contained, implying no humans).

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the passage:

* **B: Konkolaatichi meeshaa murteessaa ta’uu ittuma fufe** (The spacecraft carried important instruments) - The passage says it carried three important scientific instruments.
* **C: Konkolaatichi yeroo furguggifamu milkaa’aa ture** (The spacecraft was successful when launched) - The passage states it successfully reached lunar orbit and the south pole.
* **D: Konkolaatichi gam lamaanuu halluu dibamaa qaba** (The spacecraft had two-dimensional imaging capabilities) - The passage mentions it took pictures (""fakkii"") implying imaging.



"
Himoota armaan gadii keessaa konkolaataa hawaa (lunar probe) sirriitti kan ibsu kami?,"Correct answer is **C: Orbitarii nama baatu irraa furguggifame ykn adda bahe**.

Here's why:

The passage states the probe was launched into orbit around the moon ( ""Kan hin maqnee orbiitin ji’aa Chandrayaan-1...""). It also indicates it successfully reached the lunar south pole region. This implies it wasn't a lander (ruling out B), it's not described as a satellite with a specific feature like a flag (ruling out A), and it carried *three* scientific instruments (""Meeshaalee saayinsaawaa barbaachisoo sadii baachuun""), not two (ruling out D). Therefore, the most accurate description is that it's an orbiter that separated from a manned spacecraft.



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’un, tarkaanfii dhibee ittisuuf taasifamu keessaa dhumarratti hojiirra kan oolu kami?","The correct answer is **C: Talaallii dhukkuba sammuu ykn ensafilaayitas (Encephalitis vaccination)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Karoorri talaallii dhukkubaa bakka akka seenaatti midhamaniif raabsuubara kana rakkoo hanqina qarshiitiifi dhukkuboota kaaniif dursa kennu dhabuuti."" (The vaccination plan for the disease is being delayed due to lack of funds and the inability to prioritize it over other diseases.)

This clearly indicates that vaccination is the intended, though currently delayed, final step in the disease control effort.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Farra ilbiisotaa (Raising awareness):** While mentioned as something the government will do, it's a preliminary step, not the final one.
*   **B: Kiyyoo ittiin booyyee qaban (Pig catchers):** This is a measure to control the source of the disease (pigs), but not the final preventative action for humans.
*   **D: Golgaa bookee (Quarantine of pigs):** Similar to pig catchers, it controls the source, but isn't the direct human preventative measure.



"
Dhibichi akkamitti namatti daddarba?,"The correct answer is **B: Farra ilbiisotaa** (Mosquitoes).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Weerarichi mootummaa Indiyaa ... farra ilbiisotaa biifuu akka fudhatuuf kakaase."" (The Indian government's response... includes fumigating mosquitoes). This directly indicates that mosquitoes are the vector spreading the disease to people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bookeewwan** (Flies) - The text doesn't mention flies as a carrier.
*   **C: Booyyeewwan** (Animals) - The disease originates from animals, but is transmitted *to* humans, not directly *by* them.
*   **D: Kiyyoo ittiin booyyee qaban** (Animal waste) - Animal waste is mentioned as a source of the disease, but not the direct method of transmission."
Himni lammaffaa yoo hin milkoofne maal geessisa?,"The correct answer is **B: Mirga yuuniyeenii sivilii jaalattoota saala wal-fakkaataa gara fuulduraa** (The right of civil unions for same-sex couples going forward).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kufaatiin hima lamaffaa, kan saalli wal fakkaatan akka hin tokkoomnee yaada dhorku dhiyeessu, gara fuulduraatti tokkummaa saala walfakkiitiif balbala banuufi danda’a.""  This translates to: ""The failure of the second bill, which presented the idea that same-sex couples should not be treated as one, could open the door to same-sex civil unions in the future."" 

This directly links the failure of the bill to the *possibility* of progress towards rights for same-sex couples.  The other options are not supported by the text.

* **A: HJR-3 hatattamaan xiinxaluu** (Immediate consideration of HJR-3) - HJR-3 is mentioned later in the context of *review*, not immediate consideration *because* the second bill failed.
* **C: Walgahii hatattamaa seeraa tumtuu** (Emergency legislative session) - The text doesn't suggest an emergency session.
* **D: Yuuniyeenii jaalattoota saala wal-fakkaataa dhorkame** (Blocked same-sex civil unions) - The failure of the bill doesn't *block* them, it *opens the possibility* of them.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, himni lammaffaan yoom haqame?","The correct answer is **C: Gaafa Wiixataa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...himni lamaffaan yeroo jalqabaa mana-maree baka bu’oota ummataatiin haqamuu itti aansee Wiixata gara mana mareetti haala walfakaatuun darbe.""  This translates to ""...the second claim was first upheld by a public court, followed by Wiixata going to court in a similar manner.""

Therefore, the second claim was upheld *when Wiixata went to court*.



"
“Panaamaa Peepars” eenyuutti dhoksaan kenname?,"The correct answer is **A: Dhaabbata Moosak Fonseka**.

Here's why:

The text states the ""Panama Papers"" came from files obtained from the law firm **Mosaak Fonseka** in Panama. The papers revealed how this firm helped clients evade taxes and hide wealth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pireesii** - Not mentioned in the text.
* **C: Baankii Deutsche** - While banks are implicated in *using* the services, the papers originated from the law firm.
* **D: Hoggantoota mootummaa Ayisland** - The text states leaders of Iceland and Pakistan *resigned* due to the revelations, but weren't the source of the leak or the ones doing the concealing.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, Pireesin Biriitish dhaabbilee qabeenya heddu dhuunfatan hoogganaa ture jechuun eenyu himatan?","The correct answer is **A: Maamiloota dureeyyii baankilee hedduu** (Many wealthy bank clients).

Here's why:

The text states the Panama Papers revealed that four banks helped clients evade taxes and hide assets worth billions of dollars. This implies the clients themselves, the wealthy individuals using these banks, were the ones engaging in the practices described. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dhaabbata seeraa Panaamaa** (Panama Law Firm): While the papers *came from* the law firm Mossack Fonseca, they didn't lead the wealth-hiding; they were the source of the information *about* those doing it.
*   **C: Baankii Deutsche** (Deutsche Bank): While the text mentions banks generally, it doesn't specifically point to Deutsche Bank as the leader.
*   **D: Mootummaa Paakistaan** (Pakistan Government): The text states leaders of Iceland and Pakistan *resigned* as a result of the papers, but they weren’t the ones leading the wealth-hiding.



"
Balaawwan xayyaaraa armaan gadii keessaa kan namoonni heddu itti du’an kami?,"Correct answer is **A: Xayyaara osoo Iraan irraa gara Armiiniyaa imaluu kufee caccabe**.

The text states that the plane that crashed while attempting to go from Iran to Armenia killed 168 people, which is the highest number of fatalities mentioned in the passage. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Helikoptara poolisii caccabe** - Killed 3 people and injured 3, a much smaller number.
*   **C: Xayyaara osoo Armiiniyaa irraa gara Iraan imaluu kufee caccabe** - This scenario is not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Xayyaara Mashhaaditti caccabe** - Killed 7 people, less than the Armenia-bound plane.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa balaa xayyaaraa heddu Iraanitti mudatuuf sababa kan hin taane kami?,"Correct answer: **C: Qoqqobbii xayyaarota haaraa akka hin binne dhokru**

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the *consequences* of old, poorly maintained aircraft and the inability to acquire new ones due to sanctions. It highlights accidents caused by:

*   **Old aircraft:** The initial incident with the helicopter and the later plane crash both involved aging aircraft.
*   **Sanctions:** The text explicitly states that the country's financial restrictions prevent it from purchasing new aircraft (""Uggurri biyyaalessaa hiiki inni qabu xayyaarri haaraan bitamu hin danda’aniidha"" - ""The country's financial restrictions prevent it from purchasing new aircraft"").

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Xayyaarota siviliifi waraanaa durii (Old civil and military aircraft):** This *is* a cause – the passage details accidents with aging planes.
*   **B: Xayyaarota haaraa bituuf hanqina bajataa (Lack of budget to buy new aircraft):** This *is* a cause – directly stated as a result of sanctions.
*   **C: Qoqqobbii xayyaarota haaraa akka hin binne dhokru (Fear of preventing new aircraft from entering):** This is not mentioned or implied in the text. There's no suggestion that there's a deliberate policy to *stop* new planes from coming in, only that they *can't* be purchased.
*   **D: Xayyaarota sirnaan qabuu dhiisuu (Not maintaining aircraft properly):**  This is strongly implied – old planes crashing suggest a maintenance issue.

Therefore, option C is the only one not supported by the information in the passage."
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa gabaasa Garee Qorannoo Iraaq keessatti kan hin hammatamin hafe kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Seera pirezidaantii qeequu** (Calling for presidential elections).

Here's why:

*   **The passage focuses on:** Security concerns, potential for conflict, the need for dialogue, diplomatic efforts, and the transition of Iraqi forces. It discusses a report outlining risks and a call to prevent escalation.
*   **Options B, C, and D are all touched upon in the passage:**
    *   **B:** The passage mentions the report being “very detailed” and suggesting a change in approach, implying a way to address the growing problems in Iraq.
    *   **C:**  The passage specifically mentions accelerating the departure of Iraqi forces from the border, which is a thought towards a solution for the Iraqi problem.
    *   **D:** The passage states that the report will be discussed within the UN Security Council, which implies seeking international involvement and potentially holding the US accountable (depending on the council's actions).
*   **Option A (calling for presidential elections) is not mentioned anywhere in the provided text.** The report's concerns are about *existing* security and political dynamics, not about changing the leadership through elections.

Therefore, the answer is **A**."
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa gabaasa Garee Qorannoo Iraaq keessatti akka ta’u kan hin gaafatamne kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Rakkina dabalaa jiru dhaabsisuuf wabii kennuu labsuu** (Offering a solution to resolve the increasing difficulties).

Here's why:

* **The passage states the report focuses on:**
    *  The impossibility of taking any position in Iraq.
    *  Stopping sectarian conflicts.
    *  Addressing police issues and a review within the UN headquarters.
    *  Rapidly evacuating Iraqi citizens before the end of the year.
    *  Activating new diplomatic initiatives.

* **Option A** – offering a solution to the difficulties – isn't mentioned as part of the report’s focus. The report *describes* difficulties and outlines actions related to them (evacuation, diplomacy, conflict prevention), but doesn't state it *offers a solution* to them.

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned in the passage:

* **B: Qajeelfama irratti hatattamaan jijjiirama gochuu** (Making urgent changes to the policy) –  The passage says the report could lead to ""significant change in the current approach.""
* **C: Falmii banaa ta’e fayyadamuu** (Utilizing exposed conflicts) – The report mentions addressing ""open conflicts"" (wal falmii banaa).
* **D: Inisheetivii dippilomaasii haaraa hundeessuu** (Establishing new diplomatic initiatives) - The report directly mentions initiating 78 new diplomatic efforts.



"
"Akkaataa poolisiitti, nama harka mirgaa Pirovenzaanoo jedhamee kan ilaalamu eenyu ture?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Pikooloo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Akka poolisiin jedhetti Loo Pikkooloon harka ol aanaa qaba sababnisaas inni Paalermotti harka mirgaa Piroovenzaanoos ture...""  This directly translates to: ""According to the police, Lo Pikooloo had a right hand man, as he was Pirovenzano's right hand in Palermo...""

Therefore, according to the police, Lo Pikooloo was considered Pirovenzano's right-hand man.



"
"Odeeffannoo kuticha keessatti kenname irratti hundaa’un, sababni du’a Faalkon maal ture?","The correct answer is **A: Yeroo waraana Riina dhaan ka’e du’e** (He died during the war initiated by Riina).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Yeroo inni lola Riinaan walqabateen biyya lubbuuwwan loltoota amantaa Maafiyaa Ji’oovaannii Faalkoonii fi Pa’oolo Boorseliinoo bara 1992 keessa galaafatte lola xumurarraan ga’e ajajoonni kunniin Piroovenzaanoodhaan ittifaman.” 

This translates to: ""When he entered the war related to Riina, which took the lives of Mafia believers Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992, the war ended with the completion of the orders given by Pirovenzano.”  

This indicates Falcone died *during* the conflict started by Riina. The text doesn't mention he was killed by police (B), ordered killed by Lo Piccolo (C), or killed by Borsellino (D)."
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa badhaasa Hitooshii Saa’itoo kan hin taane kami?,"The correct answer is **D: Beekaa juudoo** (Judo instructor).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** Hiitooshii Saayitoo was a Judo *athlete* and won two Olympic gold medals. It doesn't mention him being a Judo *instructor* (beekaa).
* **The text *does* state:**
    * **A: Shaampiyoonaa Addunyaa si’a lama** (Two-time World Champion) - He was a World Champion.
    * **B: Gaggeessaa Koree Federeeshinii Juudoo Jaappan Hunda** (Head of the All Japan Judo Federation’s coaching staff) - He was a head coach.
    * **C: Olompikii irratti si’a lama warqee argate** (Won two gold medals at the Olympics) - He won two Olympic gold medals.

Therefore, being a Judo instructor is the only option not mentioned in the provided text about Hitooshii Saayitoo."
Iwaasaakin eessatti waadaa ykn kakuu seene?,"The correct answer is **A: Jaappan**.

Here's why:

The text states Iwaasaki was captured *after* fleeing to Nepal and then being captured in India. It also mentions he was ""hattoota bishaan irraadhaan hatame, kan miidhamees saree nama ciinintun"" - which describes a situation where he was a pirate captured by Japanese authorities (likely relating to ship hijacking). This implies the initial wrongdoing/agreement/capture happened in Japan.

Therefore, Iwaasaki likely made a deal or committed a crime in **Jaappan**.



"
Eenyutu Iwaasaakii rukute?,"The correct answer is **B: Hattoota galaanarraa** (Smugglers).

Here's why:

The text states Iwaasaki was repeatedly caught by **hattoota bishaan irraadhaan** (smugglers/those who smuggle by water). He escaped from them, then was caught in India by authorities (not mentioned in the options). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Haadha warraa isaa** (His wife) - The text doesn't mention his wife.
*   **C: Saree** (A thief/someone who steals) - While the text says he was robbed by a thief, it doesn't say the thief *caught* him.
*   **D: Poolisii** (Police) - He was caught by police *after* escaping the smugglers in Nepal and going to India, not by them initially.



"
Alloonson yoom dorgommii isaa raawwate?,"Correct answer: **A: Shumaachar gommaa isaa fuulduraa erga jalaa miidhee booda**

Here's why:

The text states Michael Schumacher stopped his race ""when Alonso stopped,"" and the reason Schumacher stopped was ""because he got physical damage to his body at different times."" This implies Alonso stopped *before* Schumacher, and specifically after a tire issue for Schumacher (""yeroo garaagaraatti miidhaa buusaa qaama isaa irra waan ga’eefiidha"" refers to tire problems causing damage).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Fischellaan konkolaataa isaa to’achuu dadhabe** - While true, this doesn't relate to *when* Alonso raced.
*   **C: Shumaachar dorgommii isaa erga xumureen booda** - The text says Alonso stopped *before* Schumacher.
*   **D: Osoo dursuu hin eegalin dura** - The text doesn't mention anything about Alonso waiting to start."
Shumaachar dafee dorgommii akka addaan kutu maaltu taasise?,"The correct answer is **D: Sibiila gommaa wajjin walitti qabatu (car’s suspension) miidhamuu** (The car's suspension was damaged).

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Michael Schumacher dorgommii isaa kan dhaabe yeroo Alonson dhaabe irraa fagoo hin turre, **sababiin isaas yeroo garaagaraatti miidhaa buusaa qaama isaa irra waan ga’eefiidha.**"" This directly translates to: ""Michael Schumacher stopped the race not long after Alonso, **because he had damage to his body/car at various times.**"" While the passage doesn’t specify *what* part of the car was damaged, option D (the suspension) is the most logical interpretation of ""miidhaa buusaa qaama isaa irra.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Konkolaataa isaa to’achuu dadhabe** (Couldn't control his car) - This refers to Fisichella, not Schumacher.
*   **B: Alloosnoo wajjin walitti bu’uu** (Colliding with Alonso) - The passage doesn't mention a collision between them.
*   **C: Miidhaa gommaa Fiischellan irraan gahe** (Damage that happened to Fisichella's tires) - This concerns Fisichella, not Schumacher, and is unrelated to why Schumacher stopped.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, namoota hidhamaniif wabii qindeessun hojii eenyuti?","The correct answer is **D: Komishinara mana murtii (Court Commissioner)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the commissioner has the power to ensure a fair process if the complaints are valid and thoroughly investigated, and that the complaints are entered into the court's computer system. This directly relates to overseeing the release and handling of those detained.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Angawaa hidhaa raawwate (The one who carried out the arrest):** They initiated the arrest, but aren't responsible for reviewing the detention or release.
*   **B: Abbaa murtii Giliyan (Judge Giliyan):** While the judge gave the directive, the *commissioner* is the one implementing it and responsible for the process.
*   **C: Bakka Iddoo Qabannaa Giddi Galeessaa (Central Booking facility):** This is where people are held, but they don't have the authority to decide on releases.



"
"Akkaataa ajaja nama tokko yeroof to’annoo jala tursiisuu kuticha keessatti eerameetti, namoonni hidhaman sa’aatii 24 ol to’annoo seeraa jala turuuf maal akka qabaatantu hayyamamaaf?","The correct answer is **A: Wabii**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Commissioner can ensure fairness if they have the **right to issue warrants** (wabii) and thoroughly investigate complaints. It directly links having the warrant power to being able to conduct proper investigations and ensure a fair trial.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hogganaa hidhaa raawwate wajjin wal-arguu (Meeting with the person who carried out the arrest):** The passage doesn't mention this as a requirement for being detained for over 24 hours.
* **C: Himannaa idilee abbaa murtii Giliyaanin irratti dhiyaatu (Complaints filed against Judge Gilaayini):** While complaints about the judge are mentioned, they aren't directly related to the length of detention.
* **D: Dhaddacha (Pain):** This is irrelevant to the legal process of detention.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, sababni kamtu filannoo haqame ibsuuf itti hin fayyadamne?","The correct answer is **A: Balaa nageenyaa (Security threats)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that leaders are looking for ways to postpone the election due to ""security threats"" (balaa nageenyaa). While other issues are mentioned (like concerns about the constitution), the primary reason given for considering postponement is the unstable security situation. The passage specifically states they are trying to escape the ""security and peace challenges"" facing the election.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Heera mootummaa faallessuu (Violating the constitution):** The diplomats *argue* postponing the election would be unconstitutional, but this isn’t the *reason* leaders are considering it.
* **C: Baasii olaanaa (High cost):**  Cost isn't mentioned as a factor.
* **D: Heerri mootummaa hiika garaa garaa qabaachuu (The constitution having different interpretations):** While the diplomats raise this point, it isn't the core reason for wanting to postpone.



"
Filannoon maaliif dippilomaatota biratti akka hin barbaachifnetti ilaalame?,"The correct answer is **C: Heera mootummaa irratti shakkiin hiikaa nii jira ture** (There was doubt about the legitimacy of the constitution).

Here's why:

The passage states that diplomats believed the Afghan constitution was seen as ""waa ga’aa ta’ee argaaniruu akka baqaannan dhabatuuf"" (as not being able to be seen as legitimate). This directly translates to doubts about the constitution's legitimacy, making option C the most accurate answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Heera mootummaa kan mormu ta’ee argame** (The constitution was seen as controversial) - While it might be controversial, the core issue is legitimacy, not just controversy.
* **B: Balaan nageenyaa nii jira ture** (There was a security threat) - The passage mentions security threats, but this isn't *why* the election was deemed unnecessary by the diplomats.  It's a factor related to the situation, not the reason for their stance.
* **D: Filannoon baay’ee qaalii ture** (The election was very expensive) -  Cost isn't mentioned as a reason for the diplomats' concerns.



"
Tajaajila seeraa warra FATA f eenyu dhiyeessa?,"The correct answer is **A: Mootummaa Paakistaani** (The Pakistani Government).

Here's why:

The passage states that the political agents (Bakka-buutota Siyaasaa) are responsible for upholding the law and providing government services as outlined in 247 articles of Pakistani law. This directly implies the Pakistani government is ultimately responsible for law enforcement in FATA.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ejensoota Siyaasaa (Political Agents):** While they *carry out* the services, they are *directed by* the government, not the source of the responsibility.
* **C: Pirezidantii Paakistaani (The President of Pakistan):** The President doesn't directly provide these services; the government does.
* **D: Mootummaa Biritish (British Government):** The passage mentions British rule *ended* in 1947, meaning they are no longer responsible.



"
Himoota armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee “Ejensoota Siyaasaa” FATA dhugaa kan hin taane kami?,"The correct answer is **B: Pirezidantii Paakistaanidhaan filataman**.

Here's why:

The passage states the ""Political Agents"" in FATA are *moved into* the area by the President of Pakistan. It doesn't say they are *selected* or *appointed* by the President. They are existing officials being repositioned.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

*   **A: Tajaajila seeraa ni dhiyeessu:** The passage says they are responsible for maintaining law and order.
*   **C: Heera mootummaa Paakistaanitti kan qabamani dha:**  The passage mentions they are mentioned in Article 247 of the Pakistan constitution.
*   **D: Naannolee murtaa’oo irratti to’annoo guutuu qabu:** The passage implies they have authority in specific areas.



"
Ema Istoni badhaasa kamiif kaadhimamte?,"The correct answer is **C: Taatuu Cimtuu**.

The text states: ""Gooslingi fi istoon niin kadhima,tummaa Taatoo Cimaa fi **Taatuu Cimtuu** walduraadubaan fudhatan."" This translates to ""Gosling and Stone won awards for Best Actor and **Best Actress** respectively.""

Therefore, Emma Stone won an award for Best Actress (Taatuu Cimtuu)."
Fiilmichi badhaasa isa kamiif hin kaadhimamne?,"The correct answer is **C: Qinqoomina Sagalee Baay’ee gaarii** (Best Sound Mixing).

Here's why:

The text lists all the categories the film *was* nominated for, including:

*   Suuraa Filatamoo (Cinematography)
*   Qindeessaa (Directing)
*   Siinimaatogiraafii (Film Editing)
*   Dizaayinara Filannoo Uffannaa (Costume Design)
*   Gulaalaa Filmii (Film Score)
*   Tuqaa Ganamaa (Makeup)
*   Dizaayinii Piroodakshinii (Production Design)
*   Gulaallii Sagalee (Sound Editing)
*   Sagalee Waliin Makuu (Sound Mixing)
*   Fooda irratti kan jalqaba mul’atu (Original Song)

It does *not* mention a nomination for ""Best Sound"" (Qinqoomina Sagalee Baay’ee gaarii). Therefore, it's the one the film didn't receive a nomination for."
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kirkirri lafaa erga tahee booda kamtu hojii itti fufe?,"Correct answer is **A: Riiyaaktaroota warshaa Hokurikuu Shika keessatti argaman hunda**.

**Explanation:**

The text states: ""warshaan niiwukileerii walnyaachisu lakkoofsa 1fi2 Shiikaa keessa jiran garuu cufamanii turani."" This means the nuclear reactors at the Hokuriku Shika plant were shut down *after* the earthquake. The other options are either directly impacted by the earthquake (roads, Ishikawa airport) or a location not directly mentioned in relation to action taken *after* the earthquake (Niigata dam)."
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa sababa kirkira lafaatiin miidhaan kan irra gahe isaan kami?","The correct answer is **A: Manneen jireenyaa muraasa (Some houses)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Manneen jireenyaa 9400 ta’an akka bishaan hin qabne gabaasame,tilaamaan 100 kan ta’animmoo faayidaa Elektriiksiitii hin qaban."" (9400 houses were reported without water, and 100 were without electricity.) This directly links the houses to the damage caused by the earthquake.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Riiyaaktaroota warshaa Shika lama (Two Shika plant reactors):** The text states these were *shut down* as a precaution, not damaged.
*   **C: Daandilee muraasa (Some roads):** The text says roads were damaged, but doesn't specify this damage was *caused by* the earthquake itself, just that they were damaged.
*   **D: Buufata xiyyaaraa Noto (Noto Airport):** The text states the airport was shut down, not damaged.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, dhimmoota armaan gadii keessaa kamtu sanada keessatti hin hammatamne?","Correct answer is **A: Iyerusaalem fuula duraa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions Jerusalem but focuses on its significance to two religions and its inclusion *within* the West Bank (as part of the Jordan River issue). It doesn't discuss the status of ""frontline Jerusalem"" or its immediate, direct issues.
*   The passage explicitly states the **cause of the 1967 war** (the desire of Fatah for a complete withdrawal from occupied territories).
*   The passage directly discusses **the presence of militants in the West Bank** as a condition Israel is seeking.
*   The passage discusses **territorial disputes** as a core issue leading to the conflict.

Therefore, ""frontline Jerusalem"" is the only topic *not* mentioned in the provided text."
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa fedha Filisxeemin kan hin taane kami?,"Correct answer is **A: Haalota waraana duraa kanneen waa’ee daangaa irratti bu’ureffataman**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Filisxeem's desire is based on the *current* situation regarding the borders and the 1967 war.  It doesn't say their desire stems from *past* war situations.

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with Filisxeem's desires as stated in the text:

*   **B: Itti fufiinsaan sulula Yoordaanosi keessatti argamuu loltootaa:** The text mentions Filisxeem wants the existing settlers in the Jordan Valley to remain there.
*   **C: Deebilee waa’ee Yerusaalem fuula duraan wal qabatan:** The text states Yerusalem is holy to both peoples and a matter for discussion.
*   **D: Waggaa shaniif sulula Yoordaanosi keessatti argamuu loltootaa:** The text clearly states Filisxeem wants a five-year transition period for settlers in the Jordan Valley.



"
Ma biyya kamitti barumsa Seeraa barate?,"The correct answer is **A: Yuunaayitid Isteet Ameerikaa**.

Here's why:

The text states Ma'n barate Yuuniversitii Niiwu Yoorkiti fi mana barumsa seera Harvarditi, both of which are in the United States of America. While Ma'n inni dhalate Hong Kongiti, the question asks *where they studied law*.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, biyya kamtu injifannoo filannoo Ma’f gargaarteetti jedhamee dubbatama?","The correct answer is **D: Chaayinaa**.

Here's why:

The passage states Ma'n ""won a major victory to advance a platform closely aligned with the mainland Chinese side."" This directly indicates that the mainland Chinese side (Chaayinaa) helped Ma'n win the election.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yuunaayitid Isteet Ameerikaa (United States of America):** While Ma'n has connections to the US (studied there, had a green card), the passage doesn't say the US helped him win.
*   **B: Hongi Kongi:** The passage mentions Ma'n was born in Hong Kong, but doesn't indicate Hong Kong helped him win.
*   **C: Yuunaayitid Kingidam (United Kingdom):** The passage doesn't mention the UK at all.



"
"Akka kutaa kana keessatti ibsametti, Carolyn Wilson osoo magaalaa gadhiisee hin deemin eenyuuf hojjechaa ture?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""maatiin baayeen yerooma sana Carolyn Wilson inni OHA akka kuufamaa dhoksaa isaanii duraa hate biyyaa ba’e yaadatan."" 

This translates to: ""Many families at that time remembered Carolyn Wilson as having left the country before the OHA defrauded them.""

This clearly indicates Carolyn Wilson was associated with OHA before leaving the country. Therefore, she was working for OHA."
"Bara dorgommii kanaaf dorgommiiwwan afur hafe keessatti, Shaampiyoonii Konkolaachiftootaatiin eenyutu sadarkaa afuraffaa irra jira?","The correct answer is **B: Kahne**.

Here's how we can determine that from the text:

* **Shaanpiyoonshiippii konkolaachiftootaa ta’uun hafeera:** Dorgommicha hordofuun, Keseelowiskiin qabxii 2,250n Shaanpiyoonshiippii konkolaachiftootaa ta’uun hafeera. (Keselowski is 1st)
* **Sadaffaa keessatti, Hamliin qabxii digdama duubatti haftee jirti...** (Hamlin is 3rd)
* **Kahne fi Truex Jr. walduraaduubaan qabxii 2,220 fi 2,207 n shanaffaa fi jahaffaadha.** (Kahne is 5th)

Therefore, Kahne is in 4th place based on the information provided."
Dorgommii kutaa keessatti ibsame hordofuun Kahne Shaampiyoonaa Konkolaachiftootaa irratti qabxii meeqa qaba?,"The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kahne...qabxii 2,220 n shanaffaaadha."" (Kahne...has a score of 2,220 and is in 5th place). The question asks for Kahne's score. Therefore, the answer is 2220."
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, namoonni yeroo meeqa meeteorayitti kufanii boodarra madda Maarsii ta’uu isaanii mirkaneessanii jiru?","The correct answer is **C: Yeroo kudha shan**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Adoolessa darbe dhagootni kudha shan kunneen amala dhiqama meeteorayitii waliin wal qabatan."" This translates to ""Last year, only five stones were confirmed to be from Mars after being found among the 24,000 stones on Earth."" 

Therefore, people have confirmed the Martian origin of stones **five** times after finding them after meteor events."
"Akka kutaa kana keessatti eerametti, dhagaawwan ka’umsi isaanii maarsii ta’uun isaanii argame maal isaatu dhugaadha?","Correct answer: **D: Baay’inaan 34 isaaniitu jira**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Cabaa dhagoota tilmaamaan 24,000 ta’an kanneen Lafarra bu’an keessatti naannoo 34 qofaatu Maarsi irraa dhufuun isaanii mirkaneffame."" This directly translates to ""Of the approximately 24,000 meteorites that have fallen to Earth, only about 34 have been confirmed to be from Mars.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hundi isaanii gaafa roobaa meeteorayitii ji'a Adoolessa keessa argaman** - While some were found during the November meteor shower, the passage doesn't say *all* were.
*   **B: Isaan keessaa 24,000 ta'u** -  24,000 is the *total* number of meteorites, not the number confirmed to be from Mars.
*   **C: $11,000 warqii caalaatti gatii baasu** - The passage mentions the price per gram but doesn't state this is true for all of them.



"
Isichumaacher yoom sooruma bahe?,"The correct answer is **A: Erga Filiippee Maasaa kufee booda**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Schumacher retired *after* Felipe Massa was injured. This means his retirement was directly linked to stepping in to replace Massa.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dorgommii torbaffaa isaa erga mo’atee booda** - The passage mentions an accident at the Hungarian Grand Prix (which would be a race), but doesn't state it was his seventh race.
* **C: Erga Filiippee Maasaa bakka buusee booda** - He retired *after* Massa was injured, not after replacing him.  He retired *to* replace him.
* **D: Dhuma bara dorgommii 2009** - The passage suggests he *could* have stayed until 2009, but doesn't state he retired at the end of 2009.



"
Maasaan yoom miidhame?,"The correct answer is **A: Yeroo Giraand Piriksi** (At the time of the Grand Prix).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Biraazilichi balaa mataa guddaaf yeroo dorgoommii Giraand Piriksii Hangarii 2009 irratti saaxilame."" This directly translates to ""The Brazilian was hit by a big head injury during the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix."" This is when Massa was injured and replaced by Schumacher.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Erga dorgommii Formula 1 injifatee booda** (After winning the Formula 1 race) - The text doesn't say he won a race.
* **C: Osoo Shuumeeker sooruma hin bahin dura** (Before Schumacher retired) - This is related to the context but doesn't pinpoint *when* Massa was replaced.
* **D: Bara dorgommii 2009 dursa** (Before the 2009 race season) - The injury happened *during* the 2009 season, specifically at the Hungarian Grand Prix.



"
"Akkaataa kutaa kanaatti, qophiin kun AOL irratti dhiibbaa akkamii qabaata?","Correct answer is **C: Lakkoobsi fayyadamtoota AOL fayyadamtoota Yahoo fi Microsoft dhaan akka dorgoman ta’a**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the number of AOL users will be *compared* to the combined number of Yahoo and Microsoft users. This implies a competitive situation where AOL's user base will be measured against those of its rivals. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lakkoobsi fayyadamtoota AOL dabaluu danda’a** - The passage doesn’t explicitly state the number of AOL users will *increase*, only that it will be compared.
*   **B: AOL dhaabbata dhuunfaan gabaa IM uume ta’a** - While this might be true generally, it’s not a direct consequence of the information in this passage.
*   **D: AOL kana booda Yuunayitid Isteeti keessatti akka hin fayyadamne ta’a** - The passage doesn’t suggest AOL will stop being used in the United States. It just notes its significant use there.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu qophiin haaraa akka goolabamu gochuu danda’a?,"Correct answer: **C: Bilisummaa AOLn yeroo mataa isaatti gabaa guddisuu**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that AOL was able to *grow its IM base and move forward* because of its significant use in the United States. This implies that AOL's **independence in growing its own platform (gabaa IM)** was the key factor allowing it to compete.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Guddina Intarneetaa bal’inaan Yuunayitid Isteetii keessatti mul’ate:** While internet growth is a backdrop, the passage focuses on *AOL's response* to that growth, not the growth itself.
*   **B: Fayyadama gabaa IM:**  The passage states usage *enabled* the growth, but it wasn’t the new strategy.
*   **D: Walta’iinsa Yahoo fi Microsoft:** The passage mentions Yahoo and Microsoft as competitors (their numbers are compared to AOL’s), not as partners AOL worked with to improve.



"
Bakka poolisooti hin jirretti namoota meeqatu haleellaa kanaan ajjeeffame?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The text states ""kaleessa ganama dhuka’e poolisoota lama ajjeese"" which translates to ""killed two police officers in the morning."" The question asks how many people were killed *where police were not present*. Since the two police officers were killed, and the text doesn't mention any other deaths in a location without police, the answer is 2.



"
Haleellaa kana keessatti namoota shakkaman eenyutu gabaase?,"The correct answer is **A: Poolisii**.

The text states: ""Poolisiin akka jedhetti miidhaa gaheef milishoota Daa’eshii (mootummaa isilaamummaa Iraaqii fi Leevaant) shakku."" This translates to ""According to the police, they suspect ISIS militants of the attack.""  Therefore, the police are the ones who reported the suspects."
"Akkaataa haala Filooriidaan kan mo’ate naannolee hundaa akka fudhatu, Mitt Romney maal badhaafame?","The correct answer is **B: Kaadhimamtoota Paartii Rippabilikaa**

Here's why:

The text states ""Filooriidaan kaadhimamtoota shantama Roomniif badhaaste"" which translates to ""Florida awarded 50 delegates to Romney"".  This means Romney gained the support of 50 Republican delegates due to his win in Florida.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bakka buutota naannoo 32** - The text mentions Gingrich receiving 32% of the vote, not 32 delegates.
*   **C: Bakka buutota naannoo hunda** - The text only specifies 50 delegates were awarded, not all of them.
*   **D: Filannoo keessaa dhibbantaa 46** - This refers to the percentage of votes Romney won, not what he *gained* as a result.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, filannoo jalqabaa irratti Giingirich sagalee dhibbentaa meeqa argate?","The correct answer is **B: Dhibbentaa 32**.

The text states: ""Dubbi himaan Mana Maree Yuunayitid Isteetsii duraanii Niwuut Giingirich dhibbentaa 32n lammaffaa ta’aniiru."" (The speech of the former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich was second with 32 points.)
"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, eenyutu bu'aa koree irraa argame waliin fiiguu itti hin fufne?","The correct answer is **A: Giingirich**.

Here's why:

The text states that Gingrich ""jaja jecha jabaa qaba ture"" (had a strong reason) to leave Iowa, and that he plans to return to Texas to assess the results of the caucus, and potentially drop out of the race if a viable path forward doesn't exist. This implies he wasn't satisfied with his performance and wasn't confident in continuing.

The other options are incorrect:

* **Baachmaan:** The text says she decided to drop out *because* of the poor results.
* **Perii:** He is quoted expressing his plans based on the caucus results, showing he *is* dealing with the outcome.
* **Rominii:** He benefited from Gingrich leaving, and the text highlights his success in Iowa.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, bu'aa koree hordofuun waa’ee kaadhimamaa biraa gara caalu kan dubbate eenyu?","The correct answer is **D: Perii**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Peeriin akkas jechuun yaadasaa ibse ”Teeksaasitti deebi’uun qaba bu’aa walgayii galgala kanaa madaaluuf..."". This directly translates to ""Peeriin expressed his thoughts saying 'I have to return to Texas to evaluate the results of the election...'"" 

This shows Peeriin is the one discussing potentially dropping out of the race based on the election results, making him the one speaking most about a potential change in direction (a follow-up move).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **Baachmaan:** The passage states she *decided to suspend her campaign*, but doesn't mention her discussing future moves beyond that.
*   **Giingirich:** The passage says he ""became very agitated"" and Romney replaced him, but doesn't quote him discussing further plans.
*   **Romnii:** The passage says he replaced Gingrich but doesn't say he discussed anything about potential further moves.



"
Bara 2015 dura bakki agarsiisni kun qofti itti agarsiifame eessa ture?,"The correct answer is **A: Raadiyoo ToogiiNeet**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Guyyota duraa keessa, agarsiisichi yeroo dheeraan addatti intarneetiin darbu Raadiyoo ToogiiNeet irratti darbe..."" This translates to ""Previously, the show aired for a long time on Raadiyoo ToogiiNeet...""

It explicitly says the show first aired on Raadiyoo ToogiiNeet *before* any other mentioned location.  While AstroNet became a distributor later in 2015, it wasn't the original location. Teeksaas Baha is where the voice actors came from, not where the show aired."
Buufatni kunis agarsiisni kun akkamiin akka dhiyeeffamu ibsa?,"The correct answer is **C: Haala durii fakkaatuun kan dhiyaate** (Presented in a theatrical/drama-like manner).

Here's why:

* The passage states the show is described as ""a theatrical radio school, with dramatic action and very exciting content."" This directly points to a dramatic presentation style.
* The passage mentions ""taatota sagalee amaaterii"" (amateur voice actors), which suggests a performance-based format, not a realistic or documentary-style one.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Amaaterii (Amateur):** While it uses amateur voice actors, this doesn't describe *how* the show is presented.
* **B: Xiinxala sammu olaanaa kanneen qaban (Those with high intelligence):** The passage doesn't mention anything about the intelligence of the characters or audience.
* **D: Haala naannoo kan fakkaatu (Locally-based):** The show originates from the Texas Bay area, but this doesn't describe its presentation style.



"
Deeviid Heedlii gartuu loltootaa kan deeggare meeshaa dhukaasa akkamii walitti qabuuni?,"The correct answer is **B: Boombii**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Basaasii fi odeeffannoo funaansi Deeviid Heedlii dalagichi hidhattoota milishaa garee Paakistaanii Laaskihaar-e-Taayibaa 10niin akka raawwatuuf gargaaree ture."" and earlier mentions that the attacks involved ""boombilee fi meeshaalee awutomaatikii"".  Therefore, Deeviid Headley assisted the attackers with **bombs** (boombii) and other equipment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Odeeffannoo (Information):** While Headley provided information, the question asks about *what* he helped acquire/support, not just what he provided.
*   **C: Namoota dhukaasan (Injured people):** Headley did not support the injured people.
*   **D: Meeshaalee Atomaatikaa (Automatic weapons):** While automatic weapons were used, the text specifically mentions bombs in relation to Headley's assistance."
Gartuun loltootaa gara Mumbaayitti imaluuf geejjiba gosa kami fayyadaman?,"Correct answer is **A: Daandii baabura**

The text states the attacks happened at locations accessible ""karaa baaburaa Chaatraappaatii Shivaajii Terminas"" which translates to ""by road via Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus."" This indicates the attackers used roads/vehicles to reach Mumbai."
Ibsi bu’aa tapha Naadaal fi Ra’oonikiin Biriisbeeen kutaa kana keessatti caqafame sirritti argisiisu isa kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Naadaal Ra’oonikiin injifate**.

Here's why:

* The passage states ""Riikardiin Nadaal mata mataattii warreen Kaanadaa waliin 7-2 dha."" This clearly indicates Nadal won the match against Raonic with a score of 7-2.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ra’oonikiin Naadaaliin ijifate** - While Nadal won, the passage doesn't explicitly say Raonic was *defeated* just that Nadal won.
* **B: Ra’oonikiin qabxii walii galaa % 88 argate** - This refers to Nadal's first serve percentage, not Raonic's overall performance.
* **D: Ra’oonikiin qabxii 76 argate** - This refers to the number of points Nadal won, not a score attributed to Raonic.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, tapha jalqabaa booda ejjennoon Naadaalii fi Ra’oonikiin maal ture?","Correct answer: **A: Ra’oonikiin qabxii walii galaa % 88 argate**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Naadaal servii jalqabaa tuqaa 76 ittiin tapha mo’e keessatti tuqaa saaphanaa 88% galche."" This directly translates to ""Naadal won the first set 76, achieving an 88% first serve success rate."" This means Raonic *received* 88% of Nadal's first serves *in* the first set.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Naadaal qabxii 76 injifate** - While Nadal *won* the first set 7-6, the question asks about the *exchange* (what happened between them), not just Nadal's win.
*   **C: Qabxiin 7-2 ture** - 7-2 is the overall match score, not the first set result.
*   **D: Ra’oonikiin Naadaaliin ijifate** - The text doesn't say Raonic won anything. It states Nadal won the first set.



"
Sagantaa qooqa kamiitu tamsaasa Oduu Qullaa haaraa sadan keessatti hin hammatamne?,"The correct answer is **C: Afaan Jaappaan**.

Here's why:

The text states that the World Broadcasting Corporation *already* broadcast in English and Japanese. It is *beginning* to broadcast in Spanish, Italian, and Korean. Therefore, Japanese is not a *new* language being added in the three new broadcasts.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, tamsaasi Oduu Qullaa haaraa eessatti hin argamu?","The correct answer is **C: Tiyaatira**.

Here's why:

The passage states Oduun Qullaan is expanding its broadcasts to television, radio, and mobile platforms in Spanish, Italian, and Korean, *in addition* to existing broadcasts in English and Japanese. It doesn't mention anything about releasing news through theaters (Tiyaatira).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bilbila Harkaa (Radio):** The passage specifically mentions radio as a platform.
*   **B: Intarneeta (Internet):** While not explicitly stated, modern news organizations almost always have an online presence. It's highly likely Oduun Qullaan would also be available online.
*   **D: Televizhiinii (Television):** The passage directly states television is a platform for the expansion.



"
Dorgomtoota meeqatu Silaalom Guddicha hin xumurre?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Atleetota 117 keessaa 45 dirree waldorgommii Giyaanti Silaalom irratti qabxii galmeesisuu hin dandeenye.""  This translates to ""Out of 117 athletes, 45 were unable to complete the Giant Slalom course.""  Since Silaalom Guddicha is Giant Slalom, 45 athletes did not finish.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 36** - This refers to the number of athletes with similar finishing times in the first Slalom race, not those who didn't finish the Giant Slalom.
*   **B: 117** - This is the total number of athletes, not the number who didn't finish the Giant Slalom.
*   **C: 4** - This refers to the number of female athletes who didn't finish *any* race, not specifically the Giant Slalom."

This translates to: ""Her second event, Giant Slalom, she finished in 8th place, surpassing Australian Klaudia Loyesic by 2:11.60 minutes and finishing 1:09.02 minutes ahead of Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The text says 45 skiers didn't *qualify* for Giant Slalom, not finish.
*   **C:** The text doesn't provide information to compare completion rates between the two slalom events.
*   **D:** The text says Kaarpanedon finished 8th in Giant Slalom, not Slalom.

Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa NBA eenyuun addan kuchisiisuuf murteesse?,"The correct answer is **B: Taphataa Utaah Jaaz keessa taphatu** (Players on the Utah Jazz).

Here's why:

The passage states the NBA suspended the season *after* a Utah Jazz player tested positive for COVID-19. This means the NBA specifically reacted to players *on* the Utah Jazz team.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bara taphaa kubba kaachoo** (Basketball season) - The season was suspended, but it wasn't *because* of the season itself.
*   **C: Taphataa kamiyyuu qorannoo COVID-19n poozatiiva ta’e** (Any player who tested positive for COVID-19) - While this is related, the passage specifically says it started with a Utah Jazz player.
*   **D: Gartuu kubbaa kaachoo Uttaah Jaaz** (Utah Jazz basketball team) - The team is involved, but the suspension was triggered by a *player* on the team testing positive.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, waa’ee vaayirasichaa ilaalchisee maaltu NBA yaaddoo keessa galche?","The correct answer is **A: MIseensi NBA qoranichaan poozatiiva ta’aniiru** (An NBA player was tested positive).

Here's why:

The passage states the NBA suspended the season *after* a Utah Jazz player tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.  This means the positive test of a player is what triggered the league's response.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage doesn't say *many* players tested positive on the Utah Jazz, just one.
* **C:** The passage doesn't mention players showing symptoms or decreased performance.
* **D:** While similar to A, it focuses specifically on the Utah Jazz player. The important point is that *a* player in the NBA tested positive, which led to the suspension.



"
Tapha Waashingitan Kaapitaal Atilaanta Tiresharsii waliin taphatan irratti enyutu galchii injifannoo galche?,"The correct answer is **D: Aleeksi Oovechkiin**. 

Here's why:

The passage states Oovechkiin scored 2 goals and had 2 assists *leading* Washington to a 5-3 win against Atlanta. While Niklas Backstrom scored the goal assisted by Oovechkiin, Oovechkiin was the key player driving the win with his performance. The passage highlights his achievement of being the first player in over 25 years to reach 60 goals.



"
Tapha Kaapitaalii fi Tiraasher taphatan irratti galchii isaa 60 ffaa kan baranaa kan galche eenyu dha?,"The correct answer is **C: Aleeksi Oovechkiin**.

The passage states: ""...gooliin isaa lammaffaan inni galgala kanaa isa kan waqtichaa 60ffaadha, kan erga bara 1995-96 yeroo Jaaroomir Jaagir fi Maariyoo Leemiyaaksi lamaansaanii fageenya kana qaqqabanii booda taphataa jalqabaa gooliiwwan 60 yookaan isaa ol galche ta’uudhaan."" 

This means Oovechkin was the first player to score 60 goals in a season *after* Jagr and Leemieux did it in 1995-96. Therefore, he scored the 60th goal in the game.



"
Baankiin Noorizern Rook mootummaa irraa yoom deeggarsa barbaade?,"The correct answer is **D: Yeroo rakkoo liqa manaa** (When facing mortgage problems).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kasaara kaffaltii mana jireenya warra liqaa deebisuu hindandeenyee kan bara 2007 keessaatiif waan saaxilamteef Noorzerni Rook gargaarsa isii barbaachise."" This directly translates to ""Because it was unable to return mortgage payments in 2007, Noorzerni Rook needed help."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baankii biyyoolessaa erga tahee booda** (After becoming a nationalized bank) - The text says it became nationalized *after* receiving help, not before.
*   **B: Yeroo baankichi dhaabbata bulchiinsa qabeenyaa irraa adda bahu** (When the bank separated from the asset management firm) - This happened later in the timeline.
*   **C: Erga gartuun Verjin baankicha bitanii booda** (After Verjin bought the bank) - Verjin attempted to buy the bank *before* government intervention, not after.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, ibsa armaan gadii keessaa kamtu sirriitti walii galtee gartuun Verjin Noorizern Rook waliin taasise agarsiisa?","Correct answer is **C: Gartuun Verjin baankichaaf yeroo rakkoo hatattamaa liqa manaatti deegarsa taasiseeraafi**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Gareen ‘Verjin’ Sir Riichaardi Biraansan osoo baankichi harka mootummaa hin seenin dura, baankii tufameef gatii bittaa dhiyeessee ture."" This directly translates to Verjin providing financial support (gatii bittaa dhiyeessee) to the bank *before* it was nationalized (harka mootummaa hin seenin dura), during a time of crisis (baankii tufameef).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Garteen Verjin dabalataan dhaabbata bulchiinsa qabeenya Noorizern Rook biteera** - The text states Verjin *isn't* a wealth management company (""Norzerni Rook (To’ataa Qabeenyaa). Veerjin ‘baankii gaarii’ Rook Kaabaa qofa bite, kaampaanii bulchiinsa qabeenyaa miti."")
*   **B: Gartuun Verjin baankichi erga kan biyyoolessaa tahee booda bite** - The text explicitly states Verjin acted *before* nationalization.
*   **D: Gartuun Virjiin caalbaasii isaa kan jalqabaa kan taasise erga baankichi kan biyyoolessaa ta’ee booda dha** - Again, the text indicates Verjin's support came *before* nationalization.

"Akka kutaa kana keessatti ibsametti, biyya kamtu waliigaltee haala qilleensaa Kiyootoo mallatteessuun miidhama?","Correct answer is **C: Awustiraaliyaa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mootummaa koonsarvatiiviin Awustraaliyaa duraanii Kiyootoo fudhachuu didan, alergii dhagaa cileerratti garmalee hundaa’uu isaa irraa kan ka’e dinagdee miidha jedhanii..."" This directly translates to ""The former conservative government of Australia refused to accept Kyoto, stating that it would harm the economy due to the potential for increased costs related to ear allergies..."" 

Therefore, Australia is the country identified as suffering economic damage due to refusing to ratify the Kyoto protocol."
Mootummaan Awustiraaliyaa duraanii Kiyootoo raggaasisuun maal irratti miidhaa geessisa jedhee yaade?,"Haala kana keessatti deebiin sirriin **B: Diinagdee biyyattii** dha.

Dhukaastoonni harkisa keessa jiran sagantaa kamiif bobbaafaman?,"Correct answer: **D: Sagantaa Sportingii Adamsitoota Waldaa Dhukaastootaa**

Here's why:

The text specifically states ""sagantaa adamsuu Waldaa Sportingii Dhukasaa Awustiraaliyaa jalatti"" which translates to ""the Australian Sporting Shooting Association's accreditation scheme.""  This directly links the shooters to a scheme run by the Australian Sporting Shooting Association.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sagantaa Waldaa Dhukaastoota Ispoortii Awustiraaliyaa** - This is too broad. The text refers to a *specific* scheme within the association, not the association itself.
* **B: Sagantaa Eegumsa Hambaalee fi Paarkii** - The text mentions NPWS (National Parks and Wildlife Service) involvement, but the shooters are participating in an *accreditation scheme*.
* **C: Sagantaa NPWS** - NPWS is involved in oversight, but not the scheme the shooters are enrolled in.



"
Ibsi yaalii to’annoo ilbiisotaa sirritti hin calaqqisiisne isa kami?,"Correct answer is **A: Yaalii sagantichaa isa jalqabaa ta’uu isaa irraan kan ka’e, hin madaalamne**.

Here's why:

The passage states the operation was ""well-planned and executed,"" and involved thorough briefings. Option A suggests a lack of clarity about the operation being the first of its kind, implying a lack of complete planning or briefing. This is the only option that points to a potential flaw in the operation's execution or planning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dhukaastonni qajeelfama shaakalichaa fudhataniiru** - The passage explicitly states the divers *did* agree to the safety protocols.
*   **C: Dhukaastonni reenjarootaan hoogganamu** - The passage says the operation was led by experienced guides (instructors), implying direction.
*   **D: Dhukaastota afurtu filatame** - The passage confirms four divers were selected."
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, gargar baahuun eessatti argame?","The correct answer is **A: Riift Vaalii keessatti** (In the Rift Valley).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...qorataan garee **Tajaajila Qorannoo Riift Vaalii Itoophiyaa** keessaa..."" (researcher from the **Rift Valley Research Service of Ethiopia**...).  The passage discusses research *conducted* within the Rift Valley.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hambaa lafee irratti** (On the human body) - The text doesn't specify the location of the discovery as being *on* the body. It mentions molecular evidence, but not where it was *found*.
*   **C: Ragaa moolikularaa keessatti** (In molecular evidence) - Molecular evidence is the *type* of evidence used, not the location of the finding.
*   **D: Itoophiyaa Keessatti** (In Ethiopia) - While the research is *based* in Ethiopia, the specific location mentioned is the Rift Valley *within* Ethiopia.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, maaltu yeroo eegamee duratti uumame?","The correct answer is **C: Xiinxala ragaa moolekularaa** (Molecular evidence analysis).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Akka Haftee-lafee kanaatti, kana jechuun addabaan kan ragaa moolekularraatiin eegame baay’ee dursa."" This translates to ""According to this study, this means it was very early detected by molecular evidence.""  

The passage explicitly says molecular evidence was used and was *very early* in the detection process. The other options aren't directly stated as being the first thing to occur.



"
Yeroo tapha viidiyootti taphataan sochii goyyomsuu taasisuuf maal gochuu qaba?,"The correct answer is **C: Seensaroota televiiziyooniitti dhiyessanii kaa’uu**.

Here's why:

The passage states the new Nintendo Revolution allows players to ""use the television to find their place from a dark space,"" and that it ""helps with the act and process of being immersed in a video game."" This clearly refers to using the sensors to translate the player's movement in front of the TV into movement within the game.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Seensaroonni to’atan koonsoliitti dhiyaatanii jiraachuu mirkaneeffachuu** - The passage doesn't mention sensors needing to be on the console.
*   **B: Bakka teessuma isaanii rog sadeen kaa’uu** - This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **D: To’attoota qilleensa irra sochoosuu** - This is a bit of a distractor, referencing being ""immersed"" but doesn't explain *how* to move within the game.



"
Riimoota televiziyoonii fakkaatee kan kalaqame maali?,"The correct answer is **A: Seensaroota to’atan lamaan** (Two controllers).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Fakkii riimoota televiiziyoonaa fakkaatee, ajajaan kun seensaroota lama bukkee televiiziyoona fayyadamtootaa kan kaahame bakka duwwaa keessaa iddoo isaa argachuuf fayyadu."" This translates to: ""Resembling television remotes, this device has two controllers that allow television users to find their place from a distance.""

Therefore, the thing resembling television remotes is the two controllers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: To’attoota Naayinteendoo Riivoluushinii** (Nintendo Revolution controllers) - While the controllers *are* for the Nintendo Revolution, the question asks what *resembles* television remotes.
*   **C: Dhiyeessa Ijoo dubbii** (Press Release) - This is the *source* of the information, not what's being described.
*   **D: Koonsoolii Naayinteendoo Riivoluushinii** (Nintendo Revolution console) - The console itself doesn't resemble a TV remote.



"
Gabaasa yeroo dhiyoo Ejensii oduu Jiinuwaan baase keessatti maaltu hin ibsamne?,"Correct answer is **A: Xiyyaarichi doorsifamni boombii akka isa mudate**.

Here's why:

The passage states the *later* reports mentioned the plane being shot down by a bomb and diverted to Kandahar. The *initial* report only said it ""disappeared"" after taking off from Urumqi and was headed to Afghanistan.  The initial report did **not** mention the bombing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Xiyyaarichi Yuurumqii akka qubate** - The passage states it took off from Urumqi, implying it didn't crash *in* Urumqi.
*   **C: Xiyyaarichi imala isaa gara Afgaanistaanitti akka jijjiire** - Both the initial and later reports mention it was heading towards Afghanistan.
*   **D: Xiyyaarichi Kandahar akka qubate** - This information was in the *later* reports, not the initial one.



"
Gabaasa dhiheenyaa Ejensii Oduu Jiinuwaan baase keessatti kan hin eeramne maali?,"Correct answer is **B: Xiyyaarichi hatattamaan lafa qubachuu akka dhorkame**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the plane *did* crash in Yurumqii (Xiyyaarichi qubannaan muddamaa Yuurumqii haqame) and was then diverted to Kandahar (gara Afgaanistaanitti jijjiirsifamuudhaan Kaandahaar qubachuu isaa dubbatan). It doesn’t say anything about attempts to *prevent* the crash.
*   The other options are directly mentioned in the text:
    *   A: Xiyyaarichi ukkaamsamee jira (The plane was hijacked)
    *   C: Xiyyaarichi deebi’ee gara Afgaanistaanitti aka deebi’u taasifame (The plane was rerouted to Afghanistan)
    *   D: Xiyyaarichi doorsifamni boombii akka isa mudate (The hijacking involved a bomb threat)"
Yeroo sagantaa raadiyootti Saaraa Danuis maaltu balballoome?,"The correct answer is **D: Koreen Bob Daylaniin waliin qunnamtii uumuuf tattaaffii taasifamu ni dhaaba** (The committee stopped trying to establish contact with Bob Dylan).

Here's why:

The passage states that Sara Danius did ""everything she could"" to reach Bob Dylan regarding the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature, but ""at this point, nothing is happening."" She also mentions receiving many replies to her attempts to contact him. This indicates they *stopped* trying after initial efforts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mo’ataa badhaasa Noobeelii kan aartii** (The artist Nobel Prize winner) - While relevant to the overall topic, the passage doesn't say this was *revealed* during the radio program.
*   **B: Koreen kun tumsitoota irraa deebii kamuu hin arganne** (The committee did not receive any response from the nominees) - The passage states they *did* receive responses, particularly to their attempts to contact Dylan.
*   **C: Kaadhimamtoota badhaasa Noobeelii aartii kan bara 2016** (The nominees for the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature) - The passage focuses on Dylan, the *winner*, not the nominees.



"
Eenyuun quunnamuuf hin danda’amne?,"The correct answer is **D: Boobi Diyilani**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Sara Danius, the permanent secretary of the Nobel committee, ""could not, despite everything, support Bob Dylan"" regarding the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature. This means she was unable to endorse or approve of him receiving the prize.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tumsitoota Boobi Diyilanitti hedduu dhiyaatan** - This translates to ""Many supporters of Bob Dylan"". The passage says *she* couldn't support him, not his supporters.
*   **B: Saaraa Danius** - The passage explicitly states she *tried* to support him, even though she ultimately couldn't.
*   **C: Akkaadaamii warra Siwiidiin** - This translates to ""The Swedish Academy"". The passage focuses on Sara Danius's individual struggle, not the entire Academy's decision.



"
Waadaa seenuun “tarkaanfii guddaa” ta’uu isaa irratti eenyutu yaada kenne?,"The correct answer is **C: Goorden Joondirooyin**.

The text states that Goorden Joondirooyin *requested* Bush to ""remember"" that the agreement should encourage the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. This implies Joondirooyin believes the agreement is a significant (""tarkaanfii guddaa"") tool to achieve that goal.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Warra Pireesii:** The text doesn't mention any opinion from the press.
* **B: Joorji W. Buush:** The text says Bush was *requested* to remember something, not that he expressed an opinion about the agreement being a significant step.
* **D: Dubbi himaa Kooriyaa Kaabaa:** The text doesn't mention any statement from North Korea's spokesperson.



"
Silaaniya biyyoota garaa garaaf chaappaa meeqa qopheesse?,"The correct answer is **D: 1000 oli** (more than 1000).

The text states: ""Siwiidiniifi biyyoota 28 biroof chaappaa 1,000 ol qopheesse"" which translates to ""He prepared more than 1,000 prints for Sweden and 28 other countries.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 2000 oli:** The text doesn't mention a number that high.
*   **B: 1000:** The text specifically says *more than* 1000.
*   **C: 2000 kan tahu:**  Again, the text doesn't give this number.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, sababni itti fufiinsa dhangala’aa qilleensaa taankarii irraa dhufuuf ta’uu danda’u maali?","The correct answer is **C: Babal’iinsa ho’aanii** (The increase in heat).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Babaldhina ho’aa taankii keessattii irra kanka’e amma Roobiii sa’a boodaatti ujummoon taankii dhimmisaa turani.."" which translates to ""The increased heat within the tank was reported to be reducing the tank's volume after a few hours.""

This directly links the increase in heat to the expansion and subsequent leak/potential for leak from the tank. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Qabiyyeen lammaffaa hanga qabachuu danda’uutti guutuu** (The second compartment being filled to capacity): While the passage mentions capacity, it doesn't state the filling of the second compartment *caused* the leak.
*   **B: Qorannoo idilee sirna ajaja ibiddaa** (Investigation of the pumping system): The passage mentions an investigation but doesn't imply it's the *cause* of the leak. It’s a response *to* the leak.
*   **D: Ibidda karaa buufata paampii Foortii Gireelii** (Leak from the Fort Greely pump station): The leak is explicitly stated to be coming from the tank itself, not the pump station.



"
Maaliif vaalviin gadhiisaa baname?,"The correct answer is **A: Taankaricha keessa babal’iinsi sababa ho’a irraa ka’ee waan jiruuf** (Because there was pressure buildup inside the tank due to heat).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Babaldhina ho’aa taankii keessattii irra kanka’e amma Roobiii sa’a boodaatti ujummoon taankii dhimmisaa turani..""  This directly translates to ""The increased pressure inside the tank caused the tank to be vented after about three hours."" This explains the valve was opened to release the pressure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Qorannoo sirnichaa taasifame booda adda dhaabachuun humna ibsaa tureera** (After the pipeline was inspected, the power was cut off) - The passage does not mention any inspection or power cut.
*   **C: Taankaroonni hanga qabaachuu qabaniitti guutanii turani** (The tanks were full to their capacity) - While the tanks had capacity, the issue was *pressure*, not just fullness.
*   **D: Naannoon qabiyyee lammaffaa baarmeelii hanga qabachuu qabu qabachuu hin dandeenye** (The second containment area couldn’t hold the amount of oil it was supposed to) - This refers to a separate containment area and doesn’t explain the valve opening.



"
"Yeroo ammaatti, bishaanni Naayinz Waard keessaa ol ka’iinsi isaa hangami?","The correct answer is **C: hanga mudhiitti**.

Here's why:

The text states ""bishaan mudhii-ga’u olka’eera akkuma afaan galaanaa guutee irra yaa’e"" which translates to ""the water has risen to the point of overflowing like it filled its mouth."" This implies the water is rising continuously and has already exceeded any specific measurement like 20 feet or 100 feet.  It's risen *until* it's overflowing.



"
Yeroo obomboleettii Katriinaatti Naayinz Waard keessatti maaltu uumame?,"The correct answer is **C: Bishaan lolaa ol dheerinni isaa fiitii 20 ture**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Naayinz Waard, kan yeroo obomboleettii Katriinaa lolaa haga faana 20 olka’ee arge..."" This translates to ""Nainz Ward, who saw the flood during Hurricane Katrina rise over 20 feet...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text says the current flooding is 100 feet, not during Katrina.
*   **B:** While the text mentions overflowing, it doesn't specify the water reached a muddy level during Katrina.
*   **D:** This refers to the current rainfall, not the Katrina flooding.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa Haamiltaniin kan hin mirkanoofne kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Adeemsi sirriin kan kordofame ta’uuf dhiisuu isaa** (Its failure to follow proper procedures).

Here's why:

The passage states Hamilton Hospital *did* follow a procedure: ""innis dhukkubsata kanneen biroorraa qofaatti baasuu, warri hafan akka hin faalamneef."" (it only discharged patients to others, ensuring those who recovered did not spread it). This means it *did* have a procedure, and wasn't failing to follow one.

Let's look at why the other options *are* confirmed by the text:

*   **A: Bakka dhukkubsatoonni itti imalan** (Where patients were coming from) - The text states the patient came from Nigeria.
*   **B: Carraa dhukkubsatoonni biroon vaayirasichaan qabamuu qaban** (The chance other patients would contract the virus) - The hospital's procedure was designed to *prevent* this. The text focuses on controlling the spread.
*   **D: Haala dhukkubsataa kan yeroo ammaa** (The current condition of the patient) - The passage states the patient is in a critical condition: “dhukubsataa haala tasgabba’aa keessa akka ciibsan mirkaneessee jira.” (confirmed the patient was deteriorating in critical condition).



"
Wanta saayintistootni qorataniii adda baafachuu barbaadan maali?,"The correct answer is **D: Lafti akkamiin akka uumamte** (How the planet formed).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Saayintistoonni akkaata pilaanetiin itti uumamte hubachuuf abdii qabu,keesumaayyuu akkaata itti lafti uumamte."" (Scientists are hopeful to understand how the planet was formed, especially how the land was formed).

This directly indicates that the scientists are trying to figure out *how the planet/land was formed*.  The other options are related to the contents *on* the planet (proteins, organic matter), but the core focus of the research described is the planet's origin.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, cufiinsa kana irratti poolisiin naannoo gahee akkamii qabu?","The correct answer is **C: Kanneen mootora oofani gara kallattii biraatti akka adeemaniif ajejaniiru** (They were directing motorists to alternative routes).

Here's why:

* The passage states ""konkolaachistoonni karaa akka irraa jal’ifataniif ajajuuf ammoo gargaarsi poolisoota 80 qophii ture"" which translates to ""80 police officers were prepared to help direct drivers to alternative routes"". This directly indicates their role in managing traffic and guiding drivers away from the area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: FBI dhimma kana akka cufuuf gaafataniiru** (They requested the FBI to handle the case) - While the FBI was contacted, the police were actively involved in traffic control.
* **B: Dhimma kana ofiin cufuuf murteessanii jiru** (They decided to handle the case themselves) - The passage doesn't say they *decided* to handle it themselves, just that they provided support. The FBI is the primary investigating agency.
* **D: Karaa jijjiiramaa irratti harkifannaan tiraafikaa akka jiru gabaasan** (They announced that there was traffic congestion on alternative routes) - The passage states they *directed* traffic to alternative routes, not that they announced congestion.



"
Yeroo cufiinsaatti seensa ujummoo irratti maaltu uumame?,"The correct answer is **B: Karaa irraa akka jal’ataniif fayyadaniiru** (They were helped to move off the road).

Here's why:

The text states: ""konkolaachistoonni karaa akka irraa jal’ifataniif ajajuuf ammoo gargaarsi poolisoota 80 qophii ture"" which directly translates to ""80 police officers were prepared to help the drivers move off the road.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ittifamaniii turani** (They were being caught) - The text doesn't mention people being caught *on* the road, but rather helped *off* it.
* **C: Kanneen mootora oofaniif banaa turani** (They were open for motor vehicles) - This isn't mentioned in the text.
* **D: Tiraafika cimaatti kan geessu ture** (It led to heavy traffic) - The traffic jam was a *result* of the situation, not what happened *during* the arrest.

The passage states: ""Poolisichi karaa hin qaxxamuriin fi itti hin fufin, Karaa guddicha Kaaliforniyaa irratti akka ifti Tiraafikaa si’aa lamaa akka inni karaa cehuu isaa godhee."" This directly means the highway patrol directed the photographer to pull over and return to the road.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage says he *tried* to take photos near Sepulveda Boulevard, but doesn't say he stopped his car there.
*   **C:** The passage doesn't mention the photographer taking pictures of police.
*   **D:** The photographer was trying to get pictures of Bieber, but there's no indication he *succeeded* in getting any.



"
Osoo konkolaataan hin rukutamin dura ogeessi suurichaa maal hojjechuuf yaalaa ture?,"The correct answer is **A: Sepuulveda Boulevarditti konkolaataa dhaabeera** (He was trying to stop the car on Sepuulveda Boulevard).

Here's why:

The text states: ""MarsariitiiN Oduu bashannanaa TMZ akka namichi suuraa kaasuu makiina dhaabe ni hubata bakka fallaa Sepuulveda Boulevarditi"" - which translates to ""TMZ news reported that the person taking pictures stopped the car on Sepuulveda Boulevard."" This clearly indicates the individual was trying to stop the car *before* the accident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The text doesn't mention the person attempting to take pictures of the police.
*   **C:** There's no mention of the individual trying to flee or drive onto a major freeway.
*   **D:** The text doesn't say he was trying to convince the police to let him take pictures.

The text explicitly states: ""haalli pirezidaantichaa **tasgabbaa’aadha**"" which translates to ""the president's condition is **stable**."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fayyummaan itti hin dhaga’amu** (Hearing is impaired) - The text doesn't mention anything about the president's hearing.
* **B: Dhukkubbii qoonqoo qaba** (Has a cold) - The text mentions a cold and cough *alongside* a stable condition, but doesn't state the cold *is* the condition.
* **D: Dhaqna gubaa qaba** (Has a fever) - The text mentions a cough and cold, but not a fever specifically.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee pirezidantichaa dhugaan isa kami?","The correct answer is **C: Quunnamtii bilbilaa taasisuu ni danda’a** (He can conduct meetings over the phone).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Dhukuba busaafi qufaa qoonqoon ala, yeroo kana haala gaarirran jira hojii koos bilbilaan mana taa’ee dalaguu nan danda’a."" which translates to ""Apart from fever and cough, in this special situation I can continue my work from home by phone.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dhaqna gubaa hin qabu** (He doesn't have a fever) - The passage mentions fever *alongside* cough, implying he *did* have a fever, but it's now better.
* **B: Torbanoota muraasaaf manuma kan turu dha** (He has been home for a few days) - The passage states ""Guyyoota hedduuf manatti adda kan of baasan ta’us"" (He has been isolating at home for many days), not necessarily a *few* days. While true, C is a more direct statement from the text about his current ability.
* **D: Waa’ee vaayirasichaa irratti dhimma muraasa ni qaba** (He has some concerns about the virus) - While he *has* the virus, the text doesn't mention *concerns* about it, only that it was detected and his condition is stable.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, Tirooppikaal Saayikiloon Goonun akka salphatu yoomitti eegama?","The correct answer is **B: Yeroo saffisi bubbee 83 km/h tti gadi bu’u**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the cyclone is weakening as the wind speed is described as *decreasing* to 83km/h and is *expected to continue decreasing*.  Weakening is synonymous with becoming less strong, or becoming safer. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Osoo Maaldivsiin hin qaqqabin** (Before the Maldives are hit) - While this might be *when* people would *hope* it weakens, the text doesn’t say this is *when* it will weaken.
*   **C: Osoo tuqaa olaanaa hin dhaqqabin** (Before the heavy rainfall stops) - Rainfall isn't directly linked to the cyclone weakening in the passage.
*   **D: Osoo bubbeen sa’aatiidhaan maayilii 149 hin dhaqqabin** (Before the wind speed drops below 149 mph) - The passage states the wind is *decreasing* *to* 83km/h, not staying above 149 mph.



"
Saffisi bubbee olaanaa Tirooppikaal Saayikiloon Goonu meeqa?,"The correct answer is **D: sa’aatiidhaan kiloomeetira 83** (83 kilometers per hour).

The passage states: ""Har’a gara ganamaatti, saffisni bubbee 83km/h dha tilmaaman..."" which translates to ""Today in the morning, the cyclone's speed is reported to be 83km/h...""

The question asks for the maximum speed of Tropical Cyclone Goon, and the text directly provides that as 83 km/h. The other options refer to the overall distance traveled or speed in miles, not the maximum speed."
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa akka amala Kariiniya bireevisitti kan hin ilaalamne kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Gosa saphaphuu keessaa dha** (It is a type of shellfish).

Here's why:

* **The passage states Kariiniya bireevis is an organism found in water.** It's described as a single-celled organism. It *produces* a neurotoxin that *affects* shellfish, but it *isn't* a shellfish itself.
* **B: Narvii namootaa hojii dhaabsisuu danda’a** (It can disrupt human nerve function) - This is true, as the passage states it produces a neurotoxin.
* **C: Seelii danuu dha** (It is a single-celled organism) - This is directly stated in the passage.
* **D: Uumamaan kan mudatu dha** (It is caused by living organisms) - The passage says it's a living organism itself.

Therefore, stating it *is* a type of shellfish is the only option that contradicts the information provided in the passage."
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa Kariiniya bireevisin gochuu kan hin dandeenye kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Bishaan miidhuu danda’a** (Can pollute water).

Here's why:

The passage states *Kariiniya bireevis* is found in freshwater and is a single-celled organism. It *causes* problems when it overpopulates, producing neurotoxins that affect nerves and cause paralysis, ultimately leading to death often from water poisoning.  It doesn't *actively* pollute the water; it *thrives* in the water and *its overgrowth* leads to the water becoming toxic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Narvoota qurxummii keessaa hojii dhaabsisuu danda’a** (Can paralyze nerves) - The passage explicitly states it produces neurotoxins that cause paralysis.
*   **B: Haala kam keessattuu saffisaan lakkoobsaan dabaluu danda’a** (Can rapidly increase in number in certain conditions) -  The passage says it can rapidly proliferate.
*   **D: Summii niyuroonii oomisha** (Produces neurotoxins) - This is directly stated in the passage.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu sababa Haariikeenii Feliishiyaatiin hin uumamu?","The correct answer is **A: Kuufama faayidaa qabeessa (Beneficial flooding)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that despite the hurricane, ""no damage or loss of life has been reported."" It also mentions a ""beneficial"" 6.34-inch rain in Oohuu.  This indicates the flooding, while significant, wasn't *destructive* flooding, but rather considered helpful (likely for water resources).

The other options *are* consequences of a hurricane:

*   **B: Rooba bakakkaa of keessaa qabu (Containing flood waters):** Hurricanes bring heavy rainfall which leads to flooding, and efforts are often made to contain it.
*   **C: Balaqqisa irraa deebii (Recovery from damage):** While the passage says there's *no* damage yet, recovery is a common phase *after* a hurricane.
*   **D: Lolaa karaa irraa (Road closures):** Hurricanes often cause flooding and debris that lead to road closures.



Therefore, ""beneficial flooding"" is the only option that doesn't align with the typical negative consequences associated with a hurricane."
Waa’ee Haariikeenii Feliishiyaa ibsa kamtu soba dha?,"The correct answer is **B: Jalqabatti gara obomboleettii gosa 4tti osoo hin jijjiiramne dura akka bubbee tiroopikaalaatti ramadame**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Feliishiyaa, Sadarkeessa Haariikeenii Saafir-Siimpsan irratti inni aal tokko qilleensa jabaa Garee 4ffaa ture, Kibxata utuu hinbadin dura humni isaa dadhabee gara bubbee tirooppikaalaatti gale."" This directly translates to: ""Felicia, a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, weakened before Saturday and became a tropical depression.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bu’aan rooba roobe Oohuu fayyade** (The rain from Oahu was beneficial): The text mentions 6.34 inches of rain on Oahu being called ""beneficial,"" but this isn't the *main* point about Hurricane Felicia.
* **C: Odolawwan hedduun kuufama kan argatan dha** (Many streams experienced flooding): The text mentions shower activity but *states no damage or disasters have been reported*.
* **D: Roobi muraasi balaqqisa of keessaa qabu** (The rain carries potential harm): The text actually says the rain *should* exacerbate the existing drought and is surprisingly happening despite that.

Ibsi waa’ee bu’aa Piriiksi Guddaa Hangaariyaanii kan 2009 sirriitti agarsiisuu kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Pikuweet Jr. ergasii ari’ameera** (Piquet Jr. was fired afterward).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Piikuweer Jr. kan ari’ame bara 2009 Piriiksii guddaaHaangaariin booda."" (Piquet Jr. was fired after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fernaando Aloonsoo balaa mudate keessatti hirmaateera** (Fernando Alonso was involved in the crash) - The passage focuses on Piquet Jr.'s actions *leading* to Alonso being in a difficult position, not Alonso being in the crash itself.
* **B: Pikuweet Jr. injifannoo argateera** (Piquet Jr. won) - The passage doesn't mention Piquet Jr. winning anything.
* **D: Balaa mudate keessatti warri nageenya konkolaataa hirmaataniiru** (Safety car personnel were involved in the crash) -  The passage states Piquet Jr. helped bring out the safety car, but doesn't say the safety car personnel themselves were involved in a crash.



"
Balaan kuni yoom mudate?,"The correct answer is **B: Yeroo konkolaattonni biroon boba’aa guuttatan** (When other cars were filling the pit lane).

Here's why:

The passage states Pikuweet Jr. went to the pit lane *to let Alonso fill up with fuel*. This happened after Alonso stopped on the track and before Pikuweet Jr. was penalized.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Battala Aloonsoon boolla keessatti dhaabate** (When Alonso stopped on the track) - This is when the *situation* started, but the action of Pikuweet Jr. going to the pit lane happened *after* Alonso stopped.
*   **C: Osoo warri nageenya konkolaataa hin dhufin** (Before the safety car arrived) - The passage says he went to the pit lane *after* letting Alonso through, implying the safety car hadn’t yet affected the situation.
*   **D: Erga Pikuweet boba’aaf ba’ee** (After Pikuweet pitted) - The passage clearly states he went to the pit lane *before* being penalized.

"Akka kutaa kanaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu yeroo qorattoonni jalqaba amanan caalaa xiqqaa fudhate?","Correct answer is **A: Uumama sanyii**.

Here's why:

The passage states the researchers initially believed new species formation took a *longer time* (over two generations) than previously thought.  This directly relates to how long it takes for a *new species* to arise. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gabaasa waa’ee sanyii (Reporting on species):** The passage is *about* a report on species, but doesn't say the researchers changed their estimate of how much reporting happens.
* **C: Hormaata sanyii gara garaa gidduu (Evolution between different species):** While the passage discusses evolution between finches, it doesn't say the researchers changed their view of the *rate* of evolution itself, just the time to complete speciation.
* **D: Jijjiirama tirannaa sanyii (Changes in population size):** The passage doesn't mention anything about population size.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa qorattootaan kan hin gabaafamne kami?,"Correct answer is **C: Maqaa sanyii haaraa**.

Here's why:

The passage states the research *reported on the emergence of a new hybrid finch* in the Galapagos Islands. It details the parent species involved (Geopiza fortes and Geospiza conirostris), the timeframe (two generations), and the driving force (natural selection).

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned:

*   **A: Sanyiin haaraan eessatti akka uumaman** - The passage states the new finch emerged in the Galapagos Islands (Eessatti).
*   **B: Dheerina adeemsa jijjiirama tirannaa** - The passage mentions the process takes a long time, spanning two generations.
*   **D: Simbirroota hormaata keessatti hirmaatan** - The passage specifically names the two finch species involved in the hybridization.

However, the passage **does not mention the *name* of the new hybrid finch**. It only refers to it as a ""new hybrid finch.""

"
Agarsiisi siidaa loonii eessatti taasifame?,"The correct answer is **B: Magaalaa Buchaaresti keessatti**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Magaalittiin kibbabaha Awurooppaa keessaa Agarsiisa loonii qopheesuun ishee jalqabaa taati..."" This directly translates to ""It was the first city in Eastern Europe to host a balloon festival..."" and implies it happened *in* Bucharest.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Magaalota Romaaniyaa hedduu keessatti** - The text doesn't say it happened in multiple Romanian cities, only that Bucharest was the first.
*   **C: Guutummaa Kibbabaha Awurooppaa** - The text specifies it was *in* Bucharest, within Eastern Europe, not all of Europe.
*   **D: Magaalota gurguddoo Awurooppaa hedduu keessatti** - Similar to C, the text is specific to Bucharest.



"
Ibsa armaan gadii keessaa sirriitti agarsiisa siidaa loonii kan mul’isu kami?,"Correct answer is **C: Taatee agarsiisa aartii yeroo gannaatti guutummaa kibbabaha Awurooppaatti ta’e dha**

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Magaalittiin kibbabaha Awurooppaa keessaa Agarsiisa loonii qopheesuun ishee jalqabaa taati, taatee aartii uummataa kan addunyaa isa guddaati, waggaa kana Waxabajjii fi Hagayya jidduu.""  This directly points to Bucharest being the first to host a large-scale balloon festival within Europe during the summer months.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Magaalota kanneen “kalaqaan” beekaman keessatti qofaa taasifame** - While the text mentions Bucharest having a ""kalaqa"" (historic) vibe, it doesn't say the festival is *only* held in historically significant cities.
*   **B: Galma magaalaa Buchaarestiin kalaqame** - This is too narrow. The text doesn't focus on the festival *being about* the historical center, but rather *taking place in* the city.
*   **D: Akka addunyaatti taatee agarsiisa aartii hawwaasaa isa guddaa dha** - The festival is described as a large-scale event, but it is specifically highlighted as the first in Europe, not worldwide."
Sababa Raashiyaan fayyadama II-76s akka dhorkitu taasise maalidha?,"The correct answer is **B: Balaa mudate**.

Here's why:

The text states that the Il-76 experienced a ""balaa ulfaataa"" (a terrible disaster) and that Russia grounded the Il-76s ""erga balaan sun qaqqabeen booda"" (after the disaster happened). This directly links the grounding to the accident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Loltoota biyya keessaa** - While the text mentions the plane was used for military purposes and potentially by paratroopers (""loltoota""), the grounding isn't *caused* by them.
*   **C: Loltoota Sooviyeet** - Similar to A, this isn't the reason for the grounding.
*   **D: Qorannoo geggeeffamaa jiru** - While an investigation is likely happening *because* of the crash, the crash itself is the direct reason for grounding the planes, not the investigation.



"
II-76 maali dha?,"The correct answer is **C: Xiyyaara** (Airplane).

The text explicitly states: ""Xiyyaarri gara Irkuutiskiitti qajeelee ture..."" (The airplane was heading to Irkutsk...) and later refers to ""Ruusiyaan Il-76s yeroof lafa tursiiste"" (Russia grounded Il-76s...). This clearly indicates that II-76 is an airplane.
"
Ze Siimpsansiif gartuu barreessitootaa eenyu qacare?,"The correct answer is **D: Girooyiningi**.

The text states: ""...bara 1989 tti inni The Simpisans uumee **Biruuksi fi Girooyiningi** waliin ta’uun..."" This means he created The Simpsons *with* Brooke and Groening. 

Therefore, Groening is the co-creator Ze Simpsons worked with."
"Akka Filiyuuki jettetti, yaada gaarii fi kaka’umsa kennuuf eenyutu ergaafi?","The correct answer is **D: Namoota dhuunfaa dhiiraa fi durbaa**.

Here's why:

The passage states Filiyuuk wants to create a space where both men and women can openly discuss the health challenges women face, and where ""yaadoota gaarii jiran irra kaateeti fi yaada kakaasa isheeti ergameeni durba fi dhiira dhuunfaa lamaniini"" (good ideas and her own suggestions are sent by both men and women).  This directly indicates she wants input from individuals – both male and female.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Doktaroota (Doctors):** While doctors are important, the passage doesn't specifically mention them as the source of ideas and suggestions.
*   **B: Aktivistoota fayyaa shamarranii (Health activists):** Activists are also important, but the passage emphasizes broader participation beyond just activists.
*   **C: Dhiirota (Men):** The passage explicitly includes women as contributors of ideas, not just men.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, namoonni muraasni warri durbaa ol kaasanii akka hin dubbanne kan barbaadan maali?","The correct answer is **A: Dhiirota dhuunfaa** (Male doctors).

Here's why:

The passage states Filiyuuk wants the *qorichi ulfa dhorku akka qoricha barbaachisuti akka fudhatamuufi* - which translates to wanting male doctors to be accepted as necessary doctors. She feels this is needed because her good thoughts were lost and she desires this access.  The passage is about her preference for male doctors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Gatii kaffaltii fayyaa** (Healthcare costs) - The passage doesn't mention cost.
*   **C: Fayyummaa durbootaa** (Women's health) - While the overall context is women's health, the specific request is about *who* provides the healthcare, not health itself.
*   **D: Filiyuuki** (Filiyuuk) - The question is asking what *others* want, not what Filiyuuk herself wants.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, kutaan pilaaneetii baay’ee jijjiiramu isa kami?","The correct answer is **A: Lafa**.

The passage states: ""Hamma nuti beeknuti, Taayitaan caalaa kan qaama pilaanetii kana ibsuu danda’u tokko qofatu jira, maqaan isaas Lafa dha,” which translates to ""As far as we know, there is only one that can represent the body of this planet better than Titan, and its name is Lafa.""

This directly indicates that Lafa is the highly changeable part of the planet being discussed.



"
Lagoonnii fi harri dhangala’oo ifa of keessa dabarsan qaban kutaa pilaaneetii isa kam keessatti argamu?,"The correct answer is **B: Taayitaan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hamma nuti beeknuti, Taayitaan caalaa kan qaama pilaanetii kana ibsuu danda’u tokko qofatu jira, maqaan isaas Lafa dha.” (As far as we know, there is only one that can represent the body of this planet better than Titan, and its name is Earth.)  The passage is *about* Titan and describes features found *on* Titan – lagoons and shining icebergs.

Therefore, the lagoons and shining icebergs are located on **Titan**.



"
Argannoowwan kana keessaa bu’aa argannoo baalle kan hin taane maali?,"The correct answer is **B: Hubannoo baalleen lola keessatti kan hin fayyadamne ta’uu**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage focuses on the characteristics and analysis of dinosaur bones, their growth, and what they reveal about dinosaur physiology and evolution.** It discusses things like the structure of bone tissue, growth rings, and how bones can indicate age and potentially evolutionary relationships.
*   **Option B (""Understanding that bones are not used in warfare"") is completely outside the scope of the passage.** The text doesn't mention any uses of bones in conflict or any limitations thereof.

Let's look at why the other options are discussed in the passage:

*   **A: Halluu baallee mataa bineeldotaa (The marrow of dinosaur bones):** The passage explicitly mentions that bones can extend from the core of the bone to the marrow (halluu) or periosteum (qindoominni).
*   **C: Xiyyeeffannoo jijjiirama tirataa gara baalleettii (Focus on changes in structure to bones):** The passage discusses how bone structure changes over time and how these changes (like growth rings) are studied.
*   **D: Mirkaneeffannoo daayinoosaroonni baay’een akka baallee qaban (Confirmation that many dinosaurs had bones):** The entire passage is based on the premise that dinosaurs had bones and that studying these bones provides information.



"
Baallen daayinoosarootaa maal hin qabu?,"The correct answer is **B: Raachiis**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Baalleen daayinoosarii qoochoo sirnaan guddate, kan **reeykiis** jedhamu waan hin qabaneef..."" 

""Reeykiis"" translates to ""Raachiis"" in English. The passage explicitly says that daayinoosarii baallee doesn't have reeykiis/raachiis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baarbulees:** The text mentions baarbisii and baarbiyuulsii (which sound like ""barbules"" and ""barbiels""), but doesn't say daayinoosarii baallee *lacks* them. In fact, it states they *have* them.
*   **C: Qoochoo ga’eessotaa:** The text states they *have* qoochoo sirnaan guddate (grow systematically).
*   **D: Cina gara gadiin haalluu diimaa:** This option is not mentioned in the text.



"
Ibsa armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee ZMapp sirrii kan hin taane kami?,"Correct answer is **C: Yaalii PALM keessatti akka to’attootaatti fayyada**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ZMapp was used as a **guide** (eegdootti tajaajile) in the PSLM trials, not as a tool for direct treatment (to’attootaatti fayyada). Scientists used it as a basis for comparison during the three rounds of analysis.
*   The other options are supported by the text:
    *   **A: Farra qaamaa irraa hojjetame** - The passage explicitly states it is a ""cuunfaan farra-qaamaa tokko"" (a type of antibody).
    *   **B: Bakka kanaan dura hubame yaaluuf ni danda’a garuu du’a irraa hin oolchu** - The text says it initially showed promise but later studies showed it was less effective at preventing death than previously thought.
    *   **D: Akka qorannoon agarsiisutti faayidaan inni kennu kan dura yaadamee gadi dha** - This is directly stated: ""qorannooleen seera-qabeessi kan argisiisan, inni du’a ittisuuf amma yaadamee caalaa faayidaa gad-aanaa akka qabuudha.""

Therefore, option C is the only statement not supported by the information in the passage."
