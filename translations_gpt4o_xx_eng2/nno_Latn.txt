While an experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce Ebola death rates, there are no medicines that have so far proven suitable for treating existing infections.
An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially seemed promising in the field, but formal studies indicated that it was less advantageous than expected in preventing death.
In the PALM study, ZMapp served as a control, which means that researchers used it as a starting point and compared the three other treatments against it.
USA Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee's letter and acknowledges the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with USOC's statement that our athletes, clubs, and their sports' interests may benefit more from pursuing meaningful changes within the organization rather than decertification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can shed light on how abuse of this magnitude, so courageously described by the survivors of Larry Nassar, could go undetected for so long and embraces all necessary and appropriate changes.

This confirmed not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as colors and three-dimensional arrangements.
Researchers say that this animal's plumage was chestnut brown on the upper part with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but had other characteristics of feathers — barbs and barbules — the researchers assumed that the rachis was most likely a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggested that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the samples show adult plumage and not down from a fledgling.
The researchers suggested that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the samples show adult plumage and not down from a chick.
A car bomb that detonated at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than 20 other people.

They found that the sun operated on the same basic principle as other stars: It was discovered that the activity of all the stars in the system was driven by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number is, the less active the star is when it comes to magnetic reversal.

It warns that no one can guarantee that any sequence of events will stop the sectarian war in Iraq, increasing violence, or a path toward chaos.
The report opens with a plea for an open debate and the formation of a consensus in the USA about their policy towards the Middle East.
The report is very critical of almost every single aspect of the current policy of the executive towards Iraq and it calls for an immediate change of direction.
The first of the 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative should be taken before the end of this year to secure Iraq's borders against hostile incursions and to re-establish diplomatic relations with their neighbors.
The current senator, and Argentina's First Lady, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, announced her presidential candidacy last night in La Plata, a city 50 kilometers away from Buenos Aires.
Kirchner announced her intention to run for president at the Argentine theater, the same place she used to start her campaign for the senate as a member of the delegation in the province of Buenos Aires in 2005.
The debate was triggered as a result of controversy over the spending on emergency aid and reconstruction, following Hurricane Katrina; which some fiscally conservative individuals comically called the “Bush's New Orleans deal.”
Liberal criticism of the reconstruction effort has been directed at the profits the reconstruction contracts have given to the relevant insiders in Washington.

The work that was done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was after would have been a result of tidal forces between the galaxy and the Milky Way's dark matter.
In the same way that the moon exerts a gravitational force on the Earth that causes tides, the Milky Way exerts a gravitational force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The researchers were able to conclude that dark matter affected other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of halo and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "highly disturbing and alarming because of the high mortality rate."
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have been infected with the virus at the hospital, and that at least two were healthcare personnel at the hospital.
In the course of a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close people.
Nevertheless, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis still appears to be low; 6,000 of the total 330,000 people infected, at any given time in South Africa.

"Their thermal behavior is not as even as large holes on Earth, which often maintain a relatively consistent temperature, but this is consistent with these being deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing from the US Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology team from Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed paper slip indicating their choice of candidate in an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting form.
The French electoral law codifies the treatment relatively strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the voting procedure and that no envelopes are added except for those from carefully counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under close observation and by following specific procedures.

After Wednesday's event, Carpanedo has competed in two individual races in the championships.
Her first was slalom where she received a ‘did not finish’ in her first run. 36 of 116 competitors had the same result in that race.
In her second race, giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's sitting group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the winner Claudia Loesch from Austria, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth place Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's sitting group failed to complete their run, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the giant slalom failed to rank in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Assistant police inspector general D K Arya said, “We have arrested five individuals who raped the Swiss woman and have recovered her laptop and mobile phone.”
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chief Inspector of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki has said that the accused had appeared in court with covered faces.
Even though three people were inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
The driver in the car still sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the spacious Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later he was moved to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with killing her son in Edinburgh's sheriff court.
She is in custody awaiting arraignment and trial, but evidence from eyewitnesses may have been manipulated as pictures of her have been widely published.
This is common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but Scotland's legal system operates differently and the court has deemed the publication of the image as potentially prejudicial.
Professor at the University of Dundee, Pamela Ferguson, said, "Journalists seem to be taking a dangerous direction if they publish images and the like of suspects."
The Prosecution Authority, which holds the overall responsibility for prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be given at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute, which Pakistan wants based on the borders before the Middle East war in 1967.
Other topics that were covered, according to reports, include the future of the state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the conflict over the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands an ongoing military presence in the valley for ten years after an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian authorities agree to such a presence for only five years.
Shooters in the supplemental pest control trial project were to be closely monitored by inspectors while the effectiveness of the trial project was evaluated and observed.
In a partnership with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters' Association's hunting program.
According to the acting director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the Service for National Parks and Wildlife, the first four selected shooters for the initial shooting operation received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new provisional electoral council (CEP) with nine members yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth provisional electoral council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the previous provisional election council's departure as part of a package of measures to guide the country toward new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to a widespread anti-regime protest that began in October.
The occasionally violent protest was triggered because no elections had been held, some dating back to 2011.
There have been reported approximately 60 cases of iPods overheating, which has led to a total of six fires and four people experiencing minor burn injuries.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan said it had been aware of 27 accidents related to the units.
Last week, the Ministry of Trade and Industry announced that Apple had informed them of 34 more cases of overheating that the company called "non-serious."
The department responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "very regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the agency for crisis management in the Northern Mariana Islands, no damage was reported in the commonwealth.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former policeman from the Philippines took Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza used an M16 rifle when he shot at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, but it is confirmed that at least six people have died so far.
Six hostages, the children and the oldest ones, were released at an early stage, and so were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly lady who had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While he worked at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it could accelerate the maturation of the fetus's lungs.
Xinhua reported on Wednesday that government investigators had found the two 'black boxes' with the flight's audio recordings.
Other athletes also honored Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna died on a night with two moons. Quite unique, just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin "Gullstøv" Runnels commented that "Luna was as crazy as me...maybe even more...love her and will miss her...hopefully she is in a better place."
Based on a poll of 1,400 people before the federal election in 2010, it emerged that the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those who participated in the poll shared this view and wished that Queen Elizabeth would become Australia's last monarch.
At most, 29 percent of those surveyed believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent thought that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, there are questions about his form.
He has not been able to take the necessary medications to overcome the pain, as they are illegal in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery by using various hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Thursday.
Comets may possibly have been a source of deliveries of water to Earth, along with organic material that can form proteins and support life.
Researchers hope to understand how planets take shape, especially how Earth took shape since comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his position as governor earlier this month and signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He referred to the rumors as "political talk and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run as a presidential candidate in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the American air traffic control claims can allow planes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It utilizes satellite-based technology instead of older ground radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with better precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There has been no additional transport service introduced, and above-ground trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and park-and-ride are not available on site.
Fear of a lack of transport has hinted at the possibility that the matches will take place behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study that was published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new bird species developed after only two generations, even though it was believed this process took much longer, as a result of breeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, the medium ground finch, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any formation. It can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be spun into thin thread that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered and rolled out into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metal. It can be made so thin that it sometimes can be used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called a chemical's pH. You can make an indicator by using juice from red cabbage.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of electrons (since a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix together the two dry powders, then press them into a ball with clean wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo had a flush toilet in almost every house, which was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants from the sewage system have been found in the houses from the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were present together.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite that is in space receives the signal to then reflect it back down, almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Researchers use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
It requires a large rocket that is over 100 feet tall to send a satellite or a telescope out into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to provide much easier and faster opportunities for transport.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Under them, there are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from hares to antelope and deer.
In the end, there are many small cats (including stray pet cats) that eat a much more varied selection of small prey like insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, a special job each cat has that keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live together in large groups called prides.
Prides are formed by one to three adult male lions, along with as many as thirty lionesses and their cubs.
The lionesses are usually related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave very much like a wolf pack or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
As an extremely flexible athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit not so well), swim, run long distances, and drag with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that roar.
The tiger's roar is not as powerful as the lion's, but more like a sentence of growling, bellowing words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They often catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than these.
Researchers believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by using smell, sniffing out where they have been on the ground.
They have a night vision that allows them to see very well at night, and they also move very gracefully. Ocelots hunt by camouflaging themselves in their surroundings while stalking their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population they came from (for example, if they move over a mountain range or a river or if they move to a new island so that it's difficult for them to return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than the one they came from.
This new environment has different resources and other competitors, which means that the new population will need other traits or adaptations to become a strong competitor compared to what they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, the new population has begun to adapt to their new environment, which causes them to become more and more different from the other population.
In the end, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide that humans exhale (in other words, exhaling).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not have survived.
Mosasaurus was in its time a top predator, so it feared nothing – except other mosasaurs.
The long jaws of the male were surrounded by more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, with an extra set in the palate. In other words, there was no way out for those who crossed paths.
We do not know for certain, but he may have had a split tongue. The diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs. He may even have been a cannibal.
He attacked everything that ended up in the water – even gigantic dinosaurs, such as the Tyrannosaurus rex, were no match for him.
While most of their food would have been familiar to us, the Romans still had some unusual dishes for their feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormice.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate their meals sitting, the rich men liked to have banquets together while lying on their sides when they ate their meals.
Antique Roman meals could not have included food that came to Europe or America from Asia in later centuries.
They did not have, for example, corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered their home.
People brought offerings to the gods, and the priests tried to take care of the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests had access to.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not particularly important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
The women carried out the cooking in the farmyard; shops were just open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland became sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Even though he made this discovery, there were already Eskimo tribes living there at that time.
Even though each of the countries was ‘Scandinavian’, there were great differences between the people, kings, customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
This is nevertheless not correct. Even though something is written on the back, there is no treasure map.
Written on the back of the declaration of independence are the words "original declaration of independence dated July 4, 1776." The text is at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one can say for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up early in its lifespan for storage.
It is therefore likely that the note was simply added as a marking.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles had liberated the northern part of France, but the southern part was still not liberated.
It was governed by the French Vichy regime. These were Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and independent French forces had liberated the southern part of France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture shared by a group of people of significant size who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and in a way also defines the size of the society.
City-states are the drivers of nations. A civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge across multiple generations, a lingering cultural imprint, and fair communication.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and fail to become known as proper civilizations.
Through the revolutionary war, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—with Congress as its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked any power to impose taxes, and since there was no executive or judiciary branch, it relied on state authorities, who often were uncooperative, to enforce all its decisions.
It also did not have the authority to override tax law and tariffs between states.
The decisions required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, together with Germany's national football team, are the second most successful football teams in the world and were FIFA World Cup winners in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
As a result of the clusters/groups of islands Japan has, Japan is often referred to, from a geological perspective, as an "archipelago".
The beginnings of Taiwan date all the way back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, which initiated a transformation of the indigenous people's grain production practices and employed Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces from the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which transferred sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the country until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main constructions, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been reconstructed and the rebuilding process continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog era.
It is still produced today, but even more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by the sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to achieve the simplest complete ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are similar to, or approximately the same as, this aspect ratio.
The much criticized and often ridiculed rule that thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a degree of order in the image.
It states that the most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines, which divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had bound together European states, despite differences in language and customs.
It had an all-encompassing power that affected everyone from king to common citizen.
One of the most important Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are there for exactly this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being met.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, the United Kingdom initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective as it cut off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated the generally accepted international laws, codified by several small international agreements over the last two decades.
Great Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent all ships from sailing into entire sea areas and caused damage to even neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Throughout the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most residents were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the hardships and heartlessness of war during the First World War, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the USA to take a job at the Edison company in the city of New York.
He came to the USA with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous manager in his former job) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each step of China and each family that was in power became a distinctive dynasty.
Also, between each dynasty, there was an unstable age of divided provinces. The best-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which took place over 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
Throughout these periods, there was terrible warfare among many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, thousands of people died while fighting to sit on the highest seat in the great palace in Xi’an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism and republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not a single ruler.
After the revolution, positions were also open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applied to the military as ranks were now based on skills instead of class, as they had been before.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people, from oppressed working classes in other countries, to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters beyond his everyday life. He often used a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The mine itself, which survived through time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual decline.
The mine sits on top of the mountains north of Mecca, and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
She is actually not easy to find at all, even though one knows she exists. When one is inside the mine, one is completely isolated.
Nothing else can be seen but clear, beautiful sky above, and the many mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the mine.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE and is one of the many pyramid structures that were built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was made to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
"The 'up-bow' mark looks like a V and the 'down-bow mark' appears as if a pin or square is missing on its underside."
Up means that you should start at the top and push the bow, and down means that you should start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and draw the bow.
An up-bow usually produces a softer sound, while a down-bow is stronger and more defined.
Feel free to make your own marks, but remember that the markings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob of people shouting and threatening the king and queen.
The mob of people forced the king and queen to have the windows on the carriage completely open.
At one point, a member of the mob held up the head of a royal guard, who was killed in Versailles, in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses, and the interest on bonds flowed in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking.
The superprofit derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would, of course, constitute the fundamental achievements of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that facilitated the formation of the order.
The era when these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period in European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas, from technological advancement or the technological imperative, to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on society that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
One can, for example, say that the automobile will necessarily lead to the development of roads.
A nationwide road network is nevertheless not economically viable to serve only a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
Public car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the healthcare system discovering new techniques for treating injured persons.
Romanticism had a significant element of cultural determinism, drawn from authors like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and culture related to this geography emerged, and these, which were in harmony with the place of the society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around the year 400 AD and lasted until around the year 1100 AD.
This status was reduced during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were valued higher than what Byzantine markets could offer.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of fashion capital, from Constantinople to Paris, occurred.
Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th - 11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
Due to slow communication channels, the styles in the west could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop their own style. One of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is agriculture practiced for the production of enough food to only meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses stored seeds from the eco-region combined with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in agriculture for subsistence and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
A member of a subculture often signals their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, behavior, and argot.
One of the most common methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to highlight the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accident, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Such children are called "wild" or feral. Some wild children have been isolated by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment of children was due to the parents' rejection of a child’s serious intellectual or physical difficulties.
Wild children may have experienced child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others have been claimed to be raised by animals; some are believed to have lived alone in the wild.
When completely raised by non-human animals, wild children exhibit behavior (within physical limitations) almost entirely similar to their caregiving animals, such as fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, constructivist design takes learning a step further.
Constructive design is not a teaching method, but rather a tool that provides support to individuals who are engaged in a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software and is intended to question, guide, and clarify procedures that could have been too demanding for the student to handle independently.
Children are placed in foster homes for a wide range of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even to blackmail.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they do.
We view the child welfare regulation as a safety zone for these children.
Our child welfare regulation is intended to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, and stable education, in addition to a reliable healthcare system.
Foster homes are meant to meet all the needs that were lacking in the home they were taken away from.
The Internet combines elements from both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the internet led to several dimensions regarding the approach to use and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations for online use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationship" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
It is particularly claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay The President's Speech, indicated how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are still able to correctly assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such skills to interpret human behavior might be shared by pets like dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two reserves of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the reservoir of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination move the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
Out on the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to meet its need for amino acids from the available plant resources.
Moreover, it has serious consequences if one fails in this: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most accessible sources of protein would have been the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest.
In contrast, not only is animal food (ants, termites, eggs) digestible, but they provide a high amount of protein that contains all the necessary amino acids.
Considering all of this, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as the chimpanzees on the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of waking up intentionally during your normal sleep period and falling asleep again shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a silent alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you completely.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, which forces you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives involve drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, known diuretic fluids) before sleep, which will force one to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of tension in one's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
The Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path to all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (the enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantra, and visualization.
The center for Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through visualization of various gods, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightenment consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the USA. At the end of the war, the opposing systems, processes, and cultures led to the countries not getting along.
Two years after the end of the war, the two allies had become enemies and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and was fought for real, by replacement forces, on battlefields from America to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken down, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgeheads.
These plans nevertheless became obsolete overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is clearly the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the sea.
The job of the marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to transport people and goods, while at the same time, preventing your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans tried to move men and material across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy tried to stop this traffic, mainly by using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have managed to conquer the United Kingdom in addition to the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
They started animal husbandry in ancient cultures to have easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skins.
Tame goats were normally kept in flocks that grazed on fields in the heights or other grazing areas, often herded by shepherds who were often children or young people—a form of shepherd boys. These methods of herding are still used today.
Railway tracks made of wood were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though these tracks only consisted of parallel wooden planks, they made it possible for the horses pulling the wagons to achieve higher speeds and pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads that existed at the time.
Sleepers were relatively early introduced to hold the rails in place. But gradually it was realized that the rails became more effective if they had a bit of iron added on top.
This thus became common, but the iron led to greater wear on the wooden wheels of the carts.
Finally, the three-wheeled vehicles were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first tracks made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation is walking. Humans, that is to say Homo erectus (the upright human), began walking upright two million years ago.
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not regularly walk upright.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start being kinder to the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future burdens to some extent.
This is in many cases the same as treating symptoms. But if we do not only want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and solve them in that way.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity. And problems have become larger due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people.
After the Congress adopted the declaration on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the president of the Congress, John Hancock, and the secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing house of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were printed, now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in front of Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read the document to the troops in New York on July 9. On August 10, a copy arrived in London.
The 25 "Dunlap broadsides" we still know to exist are the oldest copies of the document that have survived. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are living today. We call them birds.
Many don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But the birds have many similarities with dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs just like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits – or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning is not always easy to detect. The symptoms (for example, vomiting) can be so diffuse that it is not possible to give a diagnosis immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning is an open pill bottle or toxic household chemicals that are left out.
Check the label to find out what kind of first aid you should give for the specific substance.
In a formal sense, entomologists use the term "insect" for this group of insects.
This term originates from ancient knowledge of bed bugs, which are insects that are very well adapted to being parasites on humans.
Both assassin bugs and bedbugs are nidicolae animals, which are adapted to live in the nest or house of the host.
In the USA, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which means the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
According to research, women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not the best for them, or the best for the child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to give the baby up for adoption.
In adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works, through the scientific method. This method serves as a guideline for most scientific research.
But not only this. Experimentation is also used. An experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses by asking questions and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially the Bible, in Latin.
Aristotle's view on everything related to science was what was accepted, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek diminished, the West was torn away from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only responses to external periodic signals, are documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue with periods of free-running cycles, even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading theories that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments where they either labeled the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, how important the affected genetic material is, and whether the affected cells are germ line cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other places can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to see the beautiful landscape, including plant and wildlife.
Examples of activities are hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, as well as visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
Another example is to visit, photograph, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people take their cars and leave small suburbs to go to work, while others pass them on their way to work at the place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation back and forth, everyone is in a way connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
Research now suggests that this massive CO2 economy has disrupted the biosphere from the stable state that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transport system. Almost everyone complains about the transport system.
In industrialized countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems provoke so many complaints, and why do they fail daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental behind it?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interaction between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow as one cannot predict driver behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably stable range. Traffic flows are thus often relatively stable and can be represented roughly mathematically.
A relationship has been established between the three main characteristics to better represent traffic flow: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These conditions are useful when planning, designing, and using road facilities.
Insects were the first animals that began to fly. The ability to fly made it easier for them to avoid enemies, and they found food and mates more quickly.
Most insects have an advantage in that they can fold their wings backward along their bodies.
This means that they have several small places to choose from when they need to hide from predators.
The only insects today that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Many thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some believed him, but many believed the exact opposite, that it was the solar system that moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and all other stars).
It's not so surprising, because it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. It holds more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, at some places 9.5 km wide.
A full 20 percent of all the water that flows out of all the rivers on Earth and into the sea comes from the Amazon River.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6387 km long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Even though pyramid building in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, no one ever managed to surpass the pyramids in Giza in terms of size and the excellent technical execution.
Old Egyptians in the New Kingdom wondered about the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City has a population of around 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world with the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used during religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as all of these exist in natural form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These four elements were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. Even though he also created a theory that they change into new substances and form what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. And of course, we also have the metals silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that consist of small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe consists of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so extremely small that there is room for many billions of them in the period at the end of this sentence.
The pencil was therefore a good friend to many when it was invented.
Unfortunately, the pencil has been downgraded to a lower status and used less as newer writing methods have been introduced.
People now write messages on computer screens and never need a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new appears.
The atomic bomb operates on the principle that it requires energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
A bit like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. When the core is then split again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to fall apart with little or no influence.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. We call the outer layer of the moon the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the farthest side.
She is thinner under the mares (the dark areas) and thicker under the bright areas.
There may be more seas on the nearest side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around finding out what motivates people, or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as we grow up.
The theories examine what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they want, and what it is in their environment that makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can occur when leaders start to lead colleagues with whom they were previously on the same level. At one end of the spectrum, you have the leader who tries to continue being "one of the gang".
This type of leader has problems with making unpopular decisions, reprimanding employees, conducting evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you have the leader who becomes someone unrecognizable, and who feels that he or she must change everything the group has been doing and make it their own.
Ultimately, it is the leader who is responsible for both the ups and downs in the group.
This behavior often results in conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual groups maintain the same superior standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual group members often function as a point of contact for the nearest physical group.
They often govern themselves more independently than conventional group members because their groups usually meet across different time zones, which may not be understood by the local management.
The fact that the group is truly "invisible" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual group.
The "invisible group" is the leadership group to which each of the members reports. The invisible group sets the standards for each individual member.
Why should an organization go through such a time-consuming process as establishing a learning organization? One of the goals one wants to achieve by putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in all the functional departments of an organization, creativity and inventiveness can flourish.
One result of this process with an organization collaborating to tackle an obstacle is that it leads to a new innovative process to fulfill the customer's need.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must establish a culture of innovation in addition to shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The research area is thus narrowed down and much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports the researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
New technologies allow us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that can help us understand processes in the brain.
Even though "science fiction" strongly evokes associations with artificial intelligence (AI), AI constitutes a very important part of computer science when it comes to dealing with functionality, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Example of this can be control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and questions from customers, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice, and face.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now often used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and is embedded in several PC applications and video game applications.
Excursions are a big part of all teaching. There are quite often times when a teacher would like to take the students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual excursions. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while they sit in the classroom.
Sharing an excursion virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
Every year, for example, students from the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about the trip to the largest city in the state. Every year they rebuild the website, but keep old versions online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even though students often start blogging with poor grammar and spelling, this usually changes when they gain an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts to strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also makes "students forced to understand the world around them better." The need to satisfy the audience inspires students to become smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to learn something beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to material on the internet, students can define their positions in the context of others' texts as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming capital of Canada where they speak two languages. Here you will also find a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's history and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and the northern part includes, among other things, the untapped and scenic Muskoka.
All this and more highlights Ontario as what foreigners see as the most typically Canadian.
Large areas further north have rather scattered settlements, and some areas are almost deserted wilderness.
Here is a comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the USA than there are inhabitants in Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its own continent when it comes to animal and plant life.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury holiday destinations with beautiful beaches.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, and it had a great influence on the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape route from Europe to India.
In the north, the regions are bound together by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is advised that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when you reject men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 9th century BCE and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and the city was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trade bazaars there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, including tagine, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of trinkets, but everything is for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in Congo located far east near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, and most of the city streets, especially in the center, were covered with lava.
It is relatively safe in Goma, but if you travel outside of Goma, you must carefully investigate to find out how the situation is in the North Kivu province regarding the ongoing conflict there.
The city is also used as a base camp for those who want to climb Mount Nyiragongo, and it is also the starting point for those who wish to undertake one of the most affordable tours in Africa to see mountain gorillas.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with the fact that it is relatively difficult to access, "Timbuktu" is often used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a city with a lot of poverty, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, the city was added to the World Heritage List of endangered sites due to the threat posed by desert sand.
It was one of the major stops in Henry Louis Gates' program, Wonders of the African World, which aired on the PBS channel.
The city stands in stark contrast to the cities in the rest of the country, as it is more Arabic than African in style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) lies in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, and to the south, the Crocodile River forms the border.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each with distinct animal and plant life.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa, and it is considered the flagship of South African national parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park has conservation fees and entrance fees.
It may also be wise to purchase a Wild Card, which provides free entry to either selected parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place many tourists see as the main destination of their visit.
The parade of buildings that make up the silhouette of Hong Kong has been compared to a shimmering bar chart revealed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
You get the best view of Hong Kong if you leave the island and take a trip to the Kowloon shoreline on the other side.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the plains along the northern coastline.
This was the place the British colonizers claimed as their own, so if you want to see evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest tidal forest in the world, stretching 80 km inland in Bangladesh and India from the coast.
Sundarbans is on UNESCO's World Heritage List. The part of the forest that is located in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps. They include some of the last remaining stands of the vast jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², and about one-third is covered with water/swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife and plant reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses run from the bus station (on the other side of the river) all day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, run between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since these buses between the districts are often full, it is wise to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts have small Japanese Coaster buses that are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters tall, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011 and did not open for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017. Then it is expected that the Brazilian customs inspections will be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important ethnic group living in what is now called Eastern Paraguay. There, they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in agriculture for their livelihood.
In the Chaco region, one also found other indigenous groups such as the guaycurú and payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 1500s, Paraguay, previously called "The Giant Province of Indies," emerged as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous native groups.
The Spanish initiated a period of colonization that lasted three hundred years.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of the uniqueness and identity of the indigenous people.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place at the polo fields in Las Cañitas in December.
At other times of the year, one can see tournaments and matches on a smaller scale.
Contact the Asociación Argentina de Polo to learn more about tournaments and where you can buy tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP) with a fixed exchange rate to the British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money in the only bank on the islands, in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are usually accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are often accepted as well.
On the outer islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted. Contact the owners in advance to find out what is an approved method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland pounds outside the islands, so you should do this before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region, and during the summer months, temperatures over +30 °C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold. The temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and high humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no specific "rainy" or "dry" seasons. There is roughly the same amount of rain throughout the year.
Even though many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild, and one should not feed or disturb the animals.
The park service asks you to stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may seem, both bison, deer, moose, bears, and most large animals can attack.
Every year, many visitors are injured because they have not kept a good enough distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them the space they need.
In addition, you must be aware that smells attract bears and other animals. Therefore, you should avoid bringing or making food that smells, and the camp must be kept clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, a peculiar situation arose at the harbor when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave it.
All the ships sank, with the exception of a British sailing warship. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of the leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Due to Auckland stretching between two harbors, there are many beaches there. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
North coastal beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located by the Pacific Ocean, and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches with safe conditions for swimming, and most also have shade from Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located by Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are occasionally crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The local beer is called "Number One" and is not a complex beer, but good and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to get, but New Zealand and Australian wines will probably be a better choice.
Water from the tap is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to obtain if you want to be on the safe side.
A "flat white" will be unfamiliar to an Australian. A small black coffee is espresso, a cappuccino is served with lots of whipped cream (not milk foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate typically meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but good.
There are many tours to the reef organized throughout the year, and it is rare that damage to the reef occurs as a result of this.
Nevertheless, it is wise to follow advice from the authorities and heed all signs and warnings.
One can find box jellyfish near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of the small town of 1770. Sometimes, they can also be found at other times of the year.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean. Their primary habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, travelers can be assured that they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it may be possible to book other forms of accommodation, for example at a campsite, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer package tours that include breakfast and transport to and from the airport, and sometimes with combined flight and hotel packages.
It is also possible to keep the reservation if you need time to consider the offer or arrange other documents for the destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests should be sent to the travel agency first, not directly to the hotel.
At certain music festivals, most participants choose to camp at the festival, and most participants believe this is an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to arrive early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stage has ended, there may be other places at the festival where music is played late into the night.
Some festivals have their own camping areas for families with small children.
If you are going to cross the Baltic Sea in winter, you should check where the cabin is located. Some people will hear it particularly well when the vessel passes through the ice. It makes a lot of noise.
A cruise to Saint Petersburg gives you some time in the city. There is no visa requirement for cruise passengers (check the terms).
Casinos do what they can to ensure that guests spend as much time and money there as possible. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and it can be difficult to find the way out.
There are often special prices on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and staying longer.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks, but as is well known, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Everyone who is going to drive at higher latitudes or over mountain passes must know that they may encounter snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, the friction is low, and you cannot drive the same way as on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a short time that you can get stuck.
Visibility can also worsen due to the snow that falls or blows on the window, or when it fogs up or forms ice on the car windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic generally flows uninterrupted throughout the year.
A safari is perhaps the biggest travel attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to land journeys to see the magnificent African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to go near the cars, and standard equipment will provide a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes a bit shy, and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "footing") includes hikes that can last for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics are being held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in different locations across various parts of Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, as they also hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the games were postponed, it can be difficult.
The rules for cancellation vary, but from the end of March most cancellation policies based on the coronavirus do not apply until July 2020, when the Olympics were planned.
It is expected that most tickets will cost between 2500 JPY and 130,000 JPY, with the most common tickets costing around 7000 JPY.
Damp clothes can become drier if you iron them. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards for loan, even if you do not always find this in the room.
If you can't borrow an iron, or if you don't want to use ironed socks, you could possibly try using a hairdryer.
Be careful so that the fabric does not get too hot (which can cause the fabric to shrink or, in the worst case, make scorch marks in it).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it suffices to boil the water for one minute, while in others, it must be boiled for several minutes.
The filter efficiency varies, and if you don't feel completely safe, you might consider buying bottled water with a seal from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that they are not familiar with from home.
Pests can destroy food, be an irritation, or in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases in themselves, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill humans with force, do not normally qualify as pests.
In duty-free trade, one can buy goods exempt from duties and taxes at certain places.
Travelers who are on their way to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers very challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, and one often has to drive through desolate forest areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, you must keep a cool head when you encounter steep inclines, narrow roadways, and sharp turns, which are typical for this stretch.
The speed limits are noticeably lower than on previous and later road sections, usually 56–64 km/h (35–40 mph), and it is even more important than usual to follow them.
Strangely enough, the mobile coverage is much better here than along many other stretches of the route, e.g., Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are quite rich and varied, in the same way as with the neighbor to the south, Austria.
Pastries with fruit are common, where apples are added to pastries year-round, while cherries and plums are used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Such popular cakes often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but mighty pastry, you can try what, depending on the area you are in, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry dishes are based on herbs and spices that are mixed with either meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can either be "dry" or "wet," depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry dishes. In South India and certain other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that covers a range of regional dishes found throughout the country.
But if one uses it without further qualifications, the term usually refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago and can offer a variety of simple spicy dishes. The most dominant flavors that the Javanese like best are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups provide support for the rider's feet, which hang down on each side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but this can be a safety risk because the feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but their foot is stuck in the stirrup, they may be dragged behind if the horse runs off. A number of safety measures can help minimize this risk.
For the first point, most riders use riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Certain saddles, especially English saddles, also have a safety mechanism that allows a stirrup to detach from the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a rider who is about to fall off.
Cochamó Valley – the foremost climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer a fantastic view. Climbers from large parts of the world continuously make new routes on the walls, which offer endless possibilities.
Alpine skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports where one slides down snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan their entire vacation around skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing/ski-riding is very old. Cave paintings illustrating skiers are dated back to 5000 BC!
Slalåm as a sport dates all the way back to the 1600s, and in 1861 the first ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This is also called wilderness ski tours, cross-country tours, or mountain ski tours.
The activity is related to, but normally does not involve ski touring on high mountain or peak tours in steep terrain, which requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail you will go through as if it were a long hike on foot.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover greater distances than if you were walking, but it very rarely goes as fast as cross-country skiing on groomed trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but has many independent states. Usually, when one travels through several countries, one must go through visa applications and passport controls multiple times.
But the Schengen Area functions almost like one country in this context.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross borders without going through multiple passport controls.
If you have a Schengen visa, it works the same way. You do not need to apply for a visa to each of the Schengen countries separately, thereby saving you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured goods are antiques. Some tax authorities define goods that are older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, and the age limit can be lower in, for example, North America compared to Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many with other professions.
Traditionally, not all Sámi people have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but have lived by fishing, hunting, and the like, and they have mostly used reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, i.e., the Sámi land.
Even though it is commonly used, especially by people other than the Romani people, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Romani people.
If there are travel advisories established for the country you are going to visit, this may affect the health insurance or cancellation insurance.
It may also be wise to check what advice is available from other authorities than your own, but remember that their advice is intended for their citizens.
American citizens in the Middle East, for example, may encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is just a brief summary of the political situation in the country.
What is presented here is often clear, general, and simplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the generic term for all dangerous weather phenomena that can lead to damage, serious social consequences, or loss of human life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind, hail, extreme precipitation, and fire are forms of and effects of extreme weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena include heavy snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers should also stay informed about the risk of bad weather affecting the area, as this can impact their travel plans.
Everyone planning a visit to a country that might be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
By searching the Internet for "Hostile environment course" or "conflict management course," you will likely find the address of a local company.
A course normally covers the situations that are discussed here, in greater detail, and usually with practical exercises.
A course normally lasts 2–5 days and involves role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
There are several books and magazines about how to survive in the wilderness, but there are few publications about war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo gender confirmation surgeries abroad must ensure they have valid documents for their return journey.
It varies how willing the authorities are to issue passports without a specified gender (X) or documents that are updated to match the desired name and gender.
In addition, the willingness of authorities abroad to accept these documents varies.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the time after September 11, 2001.
Before the operation, trans people probably cannot expect to get through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Outgoing currents are currents of water from waves that have broken against the shore, and that pull back, often by reefs and similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the return current is concentrated in a few deeper corridors, and here a fast current can form out towards deeper waters.
Most die from exhaustion while trying to swim back against the current, something that can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, it's no harder to swim back than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be caught by the current again. Alternatively, depending on what you can manage, and if someone has spotted you, it might be wise to wait for someone to rescue you.
Reverse culture shock can come faster than culture shock (fewer honeymoon days), and this can last longer and be more intense.
Those who have traveled abroad and have found it easy to adapt to the new culture may have found it especially difficult when they have to readjust to their own culture again.
When they come home after living abroad, they have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits they had before.
When they traveled abroad, people were probably patient and accommodating at first, since it takes some time for travelers to adapt to a new country.
Not everyone may be equally patient and welcoming when the travelers return home, but this is just as important.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most exciting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in the silence before the show starts.
Usually, you hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of the sound and the light is like a history book.
The Sphinx forms a backdrop and stands as the narrator of a long history.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations. They have the most stations, with sixteen of them being active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular and natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the area south of the peninsula and borders the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains on this side of the peninsula merge into the plateau, but reappear later to form a 360 km long mountain range in the form of the Ellsworth Mountains, where the Minnesota Glacier divides between.
The northern part, Sentinel Range, has the highest mountain in Antarctica, Vinson Massif, which has a peak rising 4,892 meters above sea level.
In remote locations where there is no mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is usually not a good replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors and have a clear line of sight to the satellite in order to make a call.
The service is often used in shipping, including leisure vessels, and during expeditions that require external data and voice services.
The local provider of telephone services should be able to give you more information about how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among students who have completed a course of study and can take a gap year before starting university, without it affecting their education.
In many cases, a course abroad during the gap year can give you better chances to pursue higher education in your home country.
Usually, one has to pay a tuition fee to enroll in such educational programs.
Finland is a great boating destination. “The land of a thousand lakes” also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and the coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes, you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Even though the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are definitely big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak for a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seventh or eighth person.
This is similar to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g., in the Netherlands, the number is one in forty).
Most regular cruises in the Baltic have a longer stop in St. Petersburg in Russia.
It means that you can visit the historic city for two whole days, but you return and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore when you are on excursions arranged during the trip, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin in Germany in the brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
It can be scary to travel by plane for people of all ages and with different backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced something traumatic.
There is nothing to be ashamed of. It is not so different from fear and aversion to other things, which very many people have.
For some, understanding more about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear based on the unknown or on not having control.
Courier companies get well paid for delivering things quickly. Time generally matters a lot when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On certain routes, the large companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, this was a problem.
If they shipped things by air freight, it could have taken several days for unloading and customs on certain routes.
The only thing that worked to get them through faster was to send them as checked luggage. The airline's regulations do not allow sending luggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
You just have to cough up a stack of notes (or preferably get your company to do it for you) if you want to fly first class or business class.
This is not cheap, and as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times more than the usual economy class price for business class, and eleven times more for first class.
Generally, there is no point in searching for cheap tickets for business class or first class on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know that there is a specific group of air passengers who are willing to pay a lot to be able to travel somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic where there have been many ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the self-proclaimed Transnistria Republic in eastern Moldova being established with its own government and currency. However, it is not recognized by any of the UN member countries.
Economic cooperation has been restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure in the political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of around 3.7 million. The city has the second largest port after Istanbul and is a very good transportation hub.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial city center that surrounds a large bay and is surrounded by mountains.
The wide streets, glass buildings, and modern shopping centers have traditional red roof tiles, a square from the 18th century, and old mosques and churches, even though the atmosphere in the city is more influenced by Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík has a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusually octagonal church.
In the cemetery, one can see interesting marble sculptures of doves over certain gravestones.
It is worth strolling around the captivating village for half an hour.
To the north and within easy reach lies the romantic and fascinating village of Sintra. The town became known to foreigners when Lord Byron so brilliantly conveyed how magnificent it was here.
Scotturb bus number 403 runs regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, you can visit the great sanctuary Our Lady of Fatima (holy place), where Mary appeared several times, stories that are known all over the world.
Remember that you are simply visiting a mass grave and a place that means immensely much to a large part of the population in the world.
There are still many men and women living today who survived the time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked themselves to death here, both Jews and others.
The place deserves to be shown dignity, reverence, and respect. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Please do not damage the place by drawing or writing on the structures.
The official languages in Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, almost everyone understands it, and virtually everyone can speak Spanish.
Most of the signs are nevertheless only in Catalan, because according to the law, it is the official primary language.
But Spanish is also widely used in connection with public transport and other services.
Regular announcements on the metro are only made in Catalan, while unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a range of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Even though it is often a misperceived stereotype, one will do best in Paris by behaving in the best possible way, like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). Then it will be much easier to get around.
An apparently brusque exterior quickly disappears in Parisians if you are fundamentally polite.
Plitvice Lakes National Park contains a lot of forest, mainly beech, spruce, and coniferous trees, and has a mixture of alpine vegetation and Mediterranean vegetation.
He has a particularly broad range of plant communities due to the spectrum of microclimates, different soil types, and varying elevation levels.
In the area, one also finds an extremely large variety of animal and bird species.
Here one finds rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie, along with many more common species.
Women visiting the monasteries must wear skirts that cover the knees, and the shoulders must also be covered.
Most of the monasteries lend shawls to women who haven't thought of this. But if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men must wear trousers that cover the knees.
It is also possible to borrow this from the collection at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable using them. The sizes fit all men!
The Mallorcan cuisine, in the same way as in similar areas in the Mediterranean, uses a lot of bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) in addition to olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli. This is bread with olive oil, tomato, and available flavorings like cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns in addition to the word Sie (De) always start with a capital letter, even if it is in the middle of a sentence.
In that way, one can more easily distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It also makes reading easier, even though writing is somewhat complicated because one must figure out if a verb or adjective is used in a nominal form.
The pronunciation is relatively simple in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, since the pronunciation varies based on the vowel that follows.
Also, make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: Caro means dear, while carro means cart.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, this introduction to grammar can teach you a lot about Persian grammar and how you can understand sentences better.
If you know a Romance language, it will naturally be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
But it is easy for those who know a little Spanish to quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that one does not need to study it separately.
Observatories built before modern times are largely obsolete today and remain as museums or educational buildings.
Since light pollution was not a problem at that time, we usually find them in cities or on university campuses where they are more accessible than those built in modern times.
Today's modern research telescopes are often enormous facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the preferred flowers.
In Japan, the first celebrations of the cherry blossom were organized by the emperor, and they were only for him and other members of the aristocracy in the emperor's court.
Plants look best when they are in a natural environment, so don't fall for the temptation to "just take one" specimen.
If you are visiting a formal garden, "taking a specimen" will definitely be grounds for being shown out.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to stay, and it is easy to get around. You can also get almost anything once you arrive.
But when you live in a tropical climate just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with both heat (continuously) and strong sun (when it's cloudless, which is more rare).
There are also some buses going north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you want to take goes all the way to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Waterways inland can be a nice foundation for a holiday trip.
For example, you can visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, take a cruise to interesting places on the Danube, or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They are also the starting point for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians worldwide have adopted many of the traditions of the holiday.
It is a tradition to stay awake on Easter night and watch the sunrise out in the open.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could just as well be a spring and fertility ritual with roots dating back to pre-Christian times.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, where the congregation often breaks into celebration at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All animals that originally came to the islands, came swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, the mammals were unable to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived at the Galapagos, several mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, where the sun does not rise above the horizon.
Then there are good conditions to see the northern lights, since the sky is more or less dark all day.
Since the population is spread across the areas and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to look at the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what people from the West are accustomed to.
A suit is the standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by surname or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, and emphasis is placed on group effort instead of praise for individual achievements.
The employees often have to get approval from their superiors for all decisions to be made, and they are expected to follow instructions from their superiors without question.
