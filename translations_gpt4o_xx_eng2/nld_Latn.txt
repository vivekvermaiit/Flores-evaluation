At the end of 2017, Siminoff was seen on the teleshopping channel QVC.
Ring also reached a settlement in a lawsuit with ADT Corporation. That is a competing security company.
One experimental vaccine seems capable of reducing Ebola mortality, but so far no drugs have proven clearly suitable for the treatment of existing infections.
A cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, initially showed a lot of promise in the field. However, official studies showed that it had fewer benefits than desired in preventing people from dying.
ZMapp was a control in the PALM trial, so scientists used it as a baseline and compared the three other treatment methods to it.
The American Olympic Committee has the support of USA Gymnastics and understands that it is necessary for the Olympic family to promote a safe place for all athletes.
We align with the USOC's statement that it is best for our athletes and clubs, and their sport, to implement meaningful changes within our organization rather than removing certifications.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can provide more clarity about how abuse on this scale, so courageously described by the victims of Larry Nassar, could go unnoticed for so long, and embraces all necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal: to ensure that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment by making gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible.
During the 1960s, Brzezinski worked as an advisor for John F. Kennedy and later for the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson.

This not only proves the already widespread theory that at least certain dinosaurs had feathers, but also offers more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional placement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
The researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development, as dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, or rachis, but do possess other feather characteristics – such as barbs.
The structure of the feathers seems to indicate that they were not used for flying, but for regulating temperature or for appearance. The researchers suggested that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but that this specimen actually shows mature feathers and therefore not the down of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen had the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.

This showed that the sun follows the same basic principles as other stars: all stellar activity in the system is solely based on the brightness and rotation of the stars.
The brightness and rotation are used to determine the Rossby number of a star. This is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the number of Rossby waves, the less active the star is when it comes to magnetic reversals.

The Commons administrator Adam Cuerden expressed his frustrations about the deletion during his interview with Wikinews last month.
'He [Wales] basically lied to us from the very beginning. First by pretending it was for legal reasons. Secondly by pretending to listen to us, until he removed the art.'
The frustrations within the community resulted in the current attempts to draft a policy regarding the sexual content of the site that hosts millions of pieces of media content with an open license.
The completed work was primarily theoretical in nature, but the program is written for the simulation of observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The team was looking for the effect that would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the universe and that of the Milky Way.
Comparable to how the moon exerts force on the earth, leading to tides, the Milky Way exerts force on the galaxy Sagittarius.
The researchers concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, the majority of the dark matter in a galaxy is located around it, in a sort of ring, and consists of a large quantity of smaller particles.

XDR-TB (Extremely Drug Resistant Tuberculosis) was discovered by Dr. Tony Moll in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa.
He stated in an interview that the new variant 'is very disturbing and concerning because of the very high mortality rate'.
Doctor Moll thinks that some patients contracted the disease in the hospital, including two healthcare workers from the hospital.
An infected person can potentially infect 10 to 15 close contacts in a year.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB among all tuberculosis patients still seems to be low: 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 infected people at any given time in South Africa.

Infrared images show that the temperature differs at night and during the day and indicate that they are likely caves.
During the day, they are cooler than the surrounding surface, and at night, they are warmer.
"The thermal behavior of this is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature. What is consistent is that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, traditionally, hardly any technology is needed for voting: voters enter a booth and place a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope that indicates which candidate they are voting for.
Officials first verify the identity of the voter. Then the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and then signs the electoral roll.
The process is relatively strictly defined in the electoral law of France.
Ballot boxes have had to be transparent since 1988, so that both voters and observers can see that at the start of the voting there are no envelopes in them and that no envelopes are added other than those of registered and authorized voters.
The candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. Volunteers count the votes in the evening under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

Her first was the Slalom, where she received a Did Not Finish on her first run. 36 out of 116 participants received the same result in that race.
In the other race she participated in, the sitting Giant Slalom, she finished tenth among the women, with a combined time of 4:41:30. That is 2:11:60 minutes slower than the Austrian winner Claudia Loesch, and 1:09:02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who finished ninth.
Four skiers from the women's seated slalom group could not complete their runs, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to qualify during the race.
The stolen laptop and mobile phone have been recovered by the Madhya Pradesh police.
According to Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya, five of the rapists of the Swedish woman have been arrested, and they have found her mobile phone and laptop.
Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar are the suspects.
According to police commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the suspects had covered their faces when they appeared in court.
There were three people in the house when the car hit it, but none of them were injured.
The driver, however, did sustain serious head injuries.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed while emergency services attempted to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to Great Yarmouth, in the James Paget Hospital.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been convicted in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court for the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting the charges and the trial, but the eyewitness account may be tainted because her story has been widely published.
This is common practice in the rest of the UK, but the justice system in Scotland works differently and courts have deemed the publication of photos as potentially detrimental.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that 'journalists are playing a dangerous game when they publish photos and similar materials of suspects.'
The Crown Office has overall responsibility for prosecutions and has informed journalists that no further statements will be made, at least until charges are brought.
According to sources, the document refers to a dispute settlement, something the Palestinians wanted based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other topics discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, a city that is holy to both peoples, and issues in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that there is a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of an agreement. However, the PA is only willing to accept a presence of five years.
Shooters in the supplementary trial for pest control had to be closely monitored by forest rangers. The trial was indeed followed, and its effectiveness was assessed.
In a collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director for park conservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four chosen shooters for the first shooting operation have undergone extensive safety and training instruction.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
With this, Martelly has achieved a CEP five times in the past four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the dismissal of the previous National Electoral Council. This is part of a package of measures to ensure new elections are held in the country.
The commission was established by Martelly in response to the widespread protests against the government that have taken place since October.
The sometimes violent protests arose because of the lack of elections, some of which should have taken place as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases have been reported of defective iPods overheating. In total, this led to six fires and four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of the 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents that the company described as 'not serious.'
"Very regrettable," was the ministry's response to the fact that Apple has delayed the report.
Mariana was hit by the earthquake at 07:19 local time (Friday 21:19 GMT).
The Commonwealth Bureau of Emergency Management reported that no damage has been reported nationwide.
Additionally, the National Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning in effect.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer from the Philippines took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle, Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists.
Several hostages have been brought to safety and so far at least six fatalities have been confirmed.
Six hostages were released earlier, including the children and elderly, and the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers returned in exchange for an older woman who needed to use the bathroom. Ultimately, Mendoza was shot.
Liggins went to work in medicine, following the example of his father.
Trained as a midwife, he started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he was working in the hospital, Liggins conducted research on preterm birth in his free time.
His research showed that the maturation of fetal lung development in babies was accelerated by the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua has reported that government investigators found two 'black boxes' with flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first 'Queen of Extreme.' My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. Just as unique as she was. A strong woman.'
Dustin 'Goldust' Runnels stated that 'Luna was just as weird as I am... maybe even weirder... I love her and will miss her... hopefully, she is in a better place'.
Of the 1400 people surveyed for the federal election of 2010, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the campaign for the 2010 federal elections that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of the participants in this survey supported this position. They want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
29 percent of respondents thought that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while at the other end, 31 percent said that should never happen.
The Olympic gold medalist swam the 100 and 200 meter freestyle and three relay races during the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was called into question due to his complaints.
He could not take the medication he needed to alleviate his pain because they are banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on January 25 the currently largest known prime number.
Several people confirmed the discovery at the beginning of February using different hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source that brought water to Earth, along with organic material that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to gain insight into the way planets form. They especially want to know how the Earth was formed, given the fact that it has been a very long time since comets collided with the Earth.
Cuomo (53) was inaugurated as governor earlier this year and last month signed a law legalizing same-sex marriages.
He called the rumors 'political nonsense and chatter'.
It is speculated that he wants to run for the presidency in 2016.
With the NextGen system, airplanes could take shorter routes according to the FAA, potentially saving millions of tons of fuel annually for a lower carbon output.
It uses satellite-based technology, in contrast to older technologies with ground radars, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft much better and providing pilots with clearer information.
No additional transport will be provided and no overground trains will stop at Wembley; furthermore, the parking spaces and the P&R are not accessible on the site.
A possible lack of transport increased the likelihood that the match would be played behind closed doors and without supporters.
A study published Tuesday in the scientific journal Science was about the formation of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within two generations. It was thought that this process took much longer because the crossing of a native Darwin's finch, the Medium Ground Finch, with an immigrant Cactus Ground Finch, the Española Ground Finch, took longer.
Gold can be fashioned into many shapes. It can be rolled into small forms.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can also be forged or rolled into sheets.
After it is made very thin, it can be applied to another metal. It can even be made so thin that it was sometimes used for the decoration of hand-painted illustrations in books that were called 'illuminated manuscripts.'
This is called the pH value of a chemical substance. You are already making an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Then the color of the cabbage juice changes based on the acidity (from acidic to basic or alkaline) of the chemical substance.
Based on the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance that was tested, the pH value is indicated.
Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron, and hydrogen ions are protons without electrons.
Mix both dry powders together, wet and clean your hands, and form a ball.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of casing.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to an advanced sewer system.
Sewer remains have been found in houses in the Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
Furthermore, there were already toilets in China, Egypt, and Persia in ancient times. For example, toilets in the era of the Romans were often part of a public bathhouse, where both ladies and gentlemen would come together in a mixed group.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
As soon as the space satellite receives the call, it is immediately sent back.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and images.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, you must have a massive rocket that is more than 30 meters long.
The wheel has changed the world incredibly. The most important thing the wheel has given us is easier and faster transport.
The train, the car, and many other means of transportation are the result of this here.
There are medium-sized felines that eat medium-sized prey, from hares to antelopes and deer.
Moreover, there are many small cats (such as stray cats kept as pets) that hunt large numbers of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their success is based on the idea of a niche, a special role that each cat has, preventing them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called prides.
Troops consist of one to three adult males that are related to each other and also have up to thirty females and cubs.
The women are usually closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A troop of lions behaves almost the same as a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that surprisingly resemble lions (but not other big cats) and are very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (although not well), swim, leap long distances, and has five times the pulling strength of a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger does not roar at full power like a lion. It's more like he growls an entire sentence.
The favorite meal of ocelots is small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. The ocelot hunts almost exclusively for animals that are much smaller than itself.
Scholars suspect that ocelots use their sense of smell to hunt small animals (their prey) by sniffing the ground where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and move very inconspicuously. Ocelots hunt prey by blending into the surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the larger population from which they originate (for example, by moving across a mountain range or river, or by being relocated to another island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, different resources and different enemies are present, so the new population must adopt a different approach or adapt to be able to face the competition.
Because they still need the same adjustments as before, the original population has not changed at all.
As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they also began to resemble the other population less and less.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different in appearance that you can no longer call them the same species.
This process is called speciation and simply involves the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide that people exhale.
By means of photosynthesis, the plants obtain their nutrients from the sun. They also provide shade.
Our houses and clothing are made from plants. We mainly eat plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain of that time. He had nothing to fear from anyone, except other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an extra set in the palate, meaning that nothing and no one could escape him.
It is not certain, but possibly its tongue was forked. It ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and possibly even its own kind.
In bodies of water, nothing was safe from the attacks; even gigantic dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex were no match for him.
Although the majority of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent known as a dormouse.
Additionally, there was another difference; poor people and women sat on chairs while eating, but wealthy men liked to hold a banquet together where they lounged on their sides during the meal.
Meals from the Roman antiquity did not include food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa. Moreover, no ancient Roman ever ate a turkey.
The Babylonians made a primary temple for all their gods. This temple was seen as the personal house of that god.
Offerings were made to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods by organizing ceremonies and feasts.
Every temple had a public courtyard and a rear hall that was accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, as part of the temples, towers in the form of pyramids were built, called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
Houses were not of great importance in the warm climate of the Middle East.
The daily life of the Hebrew family mostly took place outside.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were nothing more than a counter along the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, and therefore wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland still had few inhabitants. According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, found Greenland on his way west, and gave it its name.
He made this discovery, but there were already Eskimo tribes living there at that time.
Although they were all 'Scandinavian' countries, the people, the royal family, customs, and history of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark, and Norway were very different from each other.
Perhaps you think after the movie National Treasure that there is a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is based on a misconception. There is something written on the back, but it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the American Declaration of Independence, the words 'Original Declaration of Independence, dated 4th July 1776' are written. The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is certain that the large parchment (29¾ inches by 24½ inches) used to be rolled up for storage.
It seems that the designation has simply been added as a kind of label.
Thanks to the D-Day landings and the battles that followed, the north of France was liberated. However, the south remained occupied.
It was governed by Vichy France. These were French people who sided with the Germans in 1940 and thus collaborated with the enemy instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France with Operation Dragoon.
The Americans and the Free French had liberated southern France within just two weeks. Then they set out for Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a society.
From the Latin civilis, which means civil, comes the term civilization, related to the Latin civis, which stands for citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state; and that also defines in a certain way the scale of society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilization with a culture suggests that knowledge is passed down over multiple generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and balanced distribution.
When minority cultures disappear, they often leave no relevant historical evidence behind. Consequently, they are not officially recognized as civilizations.
During the revolution, thirteen states formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, consisting only of a congress.
The Congress lacked the power to levy taxes, as there was no national executive or judiciary, and it relied on state authorities to implement all decisions, who often were unwilling to cooperate.
Nor did it have the authority to disregard tax laws and rates between states.
First, all states had to unanimously agree to the articles before they could be amended, but the states did not take the national government very seriously, which often resulted in their representatives being absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German team, is the second most successful team worldwide and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports are soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motorcycle racing.
Winter sports are especially popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (with the largest island being Honshu). This makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often geographically referred to as a 'peninsula'.
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when sailors from Europe sailed past the island and named it Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch VOC established itself in the southwest of Taiwan as a base of operations, where the VOC addressed the indigenous grain production processes and employed Chinese workers on rice and sugar plantations.
In the year 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan were conquered by troops of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), after which Taiwan was incorporated as a province of the Qing Empire in the year 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, transferring sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Comprised of three large structures, Machu Picchu consists of the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists can get a better idea of how they used to look.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored. The renovation is still ongoing.
For example, worldwide the most common photo format for still images is 35 mm, which was the usual film format at the end of the analog film era.
These are still produced to this day, although it is primarily the aspect ratio of the image that the digital camera's image sensor adopted.
Strangely enough, 35 mm film is actually 36 mm wide, with a height of 24 mm.
The aspect ratio of this size (divide by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) would in that case be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as APS-like formats) are equal to or a close approximation of this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often misused and considered ridiculous by many, is a simple guideline that makes the image dynamic, yet also orderly.
The most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines. This way, you divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in the history of Europe, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was under fire.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity united European states, despite language differences and differences in customs.
From the king to the common citizen, his all-pervasive power influenced everyone.
One of the key principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to combat suffering and poverty, and for this reason, the church has financial resources.
The church had been the central authority in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this relationship of power and money led many people to begin questioning whether this principle was being upheld.
Great Britain imposed a naval blockade against Germany shortly after hostilities broke out.
The strategy proved effective, as it was no longer possible to supply vital provisions to military personnel and civilians. However, this blockade did violate the widely accepted international law established over the past two centuries in various international agreements.
Great Britain laid mines in international waters, so that ships could no longer sail in entire parts of the ocean, which was dangerous even for neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the country's unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations had an attitude of pacifism and isolation.
After the First World War, states wanted to prevent such horrors from ever happening again.
In 1884, Tesla emigrated to the United States of America to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the United States, he had only 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous boss) to Thomas Edison with him.
The ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each phase of China or each ruling family had a distinctive dynasty.
Also, between the different dynasties, there was an unstable period in which the provinces were divided. The most well-known was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which took place in the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasty.
During that time, fierce wars took place between different nobles who fought for the throne.
In the history of ancient China, the era of the Three Kingdoms is recorded as one of the bloodiest. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest position in the great palace in Xi'an.
The Revolution had major social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolute monarchy to republicanism, nationalism, and the notion that the country belongs to its citizens rather than a single leader.
For all male applicants, positions became available after the revolution, so that the most ambitious and suitable candidates could succeed.
The same applies to the army. Military ranks are no longer based on someone's class but on the caliber of the person.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class in other countries to revolt.
Mohammed was intensely involved with supernatural matters. He often went for reflection to a cave that later became known as the Cave of Hira in the Mountain of Noor.
The cave itself, which has withstood the test of time, provides a very vivid depiction of the spirituality of Mohammed.
The cave is located on one of the mountain peaks on the north side of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Even if it was known that the cave existed, it was not easy to find at all. Once inside the cave, there is total isolation.
The only things visible are the bright, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. There is very little of this world to see or hear from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world still standing.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of the many large pyramid structures in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or 'pyramids of Giza' in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), multiple small tombs, a number of temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu. Many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed as tributes to the women and family members of Khufu.
The up-bow sign looks like a V and the down-bow sign looks like a staple or a small square with the bottom missing.
Above means that you should start at the tip and push the bow away. Below means that you should start at the frog (the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upward movement usually produces a softer sound, while a downward movement produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
Take the liberty to sketch your personal markings, but do not forget that the printed bowings are there for a musical reason, which means they usually have to be respected.
A group of market women was behind the departure of the terrified Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, and their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They drove back to the French capital in a carriage, surrounded by jeering and threatening mobs that menaced the Royal couple.
Due to the actions of the crowd, the king and queen were forced to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At a certain moment, someone in the crowd held up the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles before the eyes of a frightened queen.
The costs of the war of U.S. imperialism concerning the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the population of the Philippines.
They were imposed by the American colonial regime to pay taxes to finance a large part of the costs, and the interest on bonds was issued through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
The American imperialism relied largely on the enormous profits from the long-term exploitation of the Philippines.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that led to the founding of the order.
The era in which this occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
After the early Middle Ages came the High Middle Ages. These were then followed by the Late Middle Ages, which typically end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term for a wide range of ideas in practice: from technological supply or technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism adhere to these two general views: the development of technology follows a path that largely extends beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has 'effects' on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, some will say that the arrival of the car automatically leads to the construction of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically feasible for just a few cars. Therefore, new production methods are being developed so that the costs of car ownership can be reduced.
The massive car ownership also leads to a greater number of road accidents, and this results in the development of new techniques in healthcare to restore the human body.
In Romanticism, a large component of cultural determinism was incorporated, which originated from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In Romanticism, geography shaped the individual, and over time, customs and cultures emerged as a result of this geography. These formed a harmonious society and were considered better than the arbitrarily imposed laws.
Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, just as Paris is the current fashion capital.
It was known as an epicenter of luxury from around 400 AD to around 1100 AD.
The status of the empire declined in the 12th century, mainly because the crusaders returned with silk and spices that were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
Around this time, Paris also took over the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the 10th, 11th, and 14th centuries.
Clothing was initially strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture from the east.
However, due to the slow communication channels, styles in the west lagged 25 to 30 years behind.
At the end of the Middle Ages, a unique style began to develop in Western Europe. One of the greatest developments was the result of the Crusades: people began to use buttons to fasten their clothing.
Subsistence farming is farming where enough food is produced to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system that is usually organic. It uses stored seeds originating from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to optimize yield.
In the past, most farmers worked in subsistence agriculture. In many developing countries, this is still the case.
Subcultures ensure that like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms are brought together, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, social class, location, and/or gender of their members.
A subculture can be characterized by the following types of qualities: linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of one or more of these factors.
Members of a subculture often show which group they belong to through a certain symbolic style in what they wear, how they behave, and the jargon they speak.
One of the most common methods for illustrating the importance of socialization were the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, adversity, or willful abuse, were not socialized by adults during their upbringing.
They are called 'wolf children' or 'wild children'. Some wolf children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); sometimes this child was abandoned because the parents did not want to accept the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Unmanageable children may have experienced serious child abuse or severe trauma before they were abandoned or before they ran away.
It is claimed of some that they were raised by animals, and of others that they lived alone in the wilderness.
A feral child that has not been raised by humans may exhibit behavior similar to that of the animal that cared for the child (within physical limits), such as fear of or indifference toward humans.
Learning on a project basis should simplify and make education more interesting, but scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a tool to support individuals dealing with a new learning experience, such as a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real. For example, a teacher is a form of support, but the Microsoft Office paperclip guy is as well.
There is virtual scaffolding built into the software that asks questions, provides reminders, and explains procedures that might be difficult for students to understand without assistance.
There are various reasons why children end up in foster care, such as neglect, abuse, and exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not well cared for, where no one cares about them, and where they cannot develop, but still, this happens.
We consider the foster care system to be a safe zone for these children.
The intention is for foster care to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
In foster care, all needs that were neglected in the previous home must be met.
On the internet, elements of interpersonal and mass communication are combined.
The different characters of the internet lead to new dimensions regarding the application of the Uses & Gratifications theory.
'Learning' and 'socialization' are, for example, presented as important reasons for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivational aspects such as 'personal involvement' and 'enduring relationships' when they examined audiences' responses to websites.
The use of video recordings led to remarkable findings in interpreting micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
It is particularly stated that no one can recognize a lie by only paying attention to micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks described in his essay The President's Speech how it is possible that people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess its sincerity.
He even suggested that other animal species, such as domestic dogs, also have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
By mutation, new genetic variation is added; by selection, this variation is eliminated from the pool of expressed variation.
For each generation, variation between the two groups occurs through separation and recombination.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans can hardly obtain the necessary amino acids from the plant sources found on the savanna.
Beyond that, failure to take it into account can have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately even death.
The easiest to find plant-based sources are the proteins in leaves and legumes, but unless they are cooked, they are difficult to digest for primates like us.
Not only is animal food (ants, termites, eggs) easily digestible, but it also contains a lot of proteins that include all essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their 'protein problem' in the same way that chimpanzees on the savanna solve this problem today.
Sleep interruption means that you wake up for a reason during your normal sleep period and fall asleep again within a short time (10-60 minutes).
This is quite easy by using a relatively gentle alarm clock that brings you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you turn off your clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room. This way, you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on the biorhythm are, for example, drinking a lot of fluids before going to sleep (particularly water or tea, a well-known diuretic). This will make you have to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is in contrast to the amount of stress someone carries in their body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the present life force. Every person is capable of achieving contentment and complete peace.
Everyone can enlighten his or her mind. Only your own stress and negativity stand in the way of this goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha. However, this form of Buddhism has been expanded with the Mahayana path of love and a large number of techniques from Indian yoga.
The Tibetan Buddhism consists of a relatively simple core of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and a pursuit of universal love.
Through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualized images, the energy of Kundalini yoga (enlightenment energy) is awakened.
The core of Tibetan meditation is yoga with a deity as the focus. Using the visualization of different deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated, and consciousness is brought to an enlightened state.
Because Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, a collaboration between the USSR and the USA was established. When the war ended, the conflicts between system, process, and culture caused the countries to quarrel with each other.
The former allies were standing directly against each other two years after the end of the war; this was the beginning of the Cold War.
The war would last 40 years, and battles with proxy armies took place on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
The Polish defense forces held out only until September 17, 1939, after which they had to withdraw and reorganize along the bridgehead in Romania.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete overnight when 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded and formed the Latvian and Ukrainian fronts, after occupying the eastern parts of Poland. This was in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international peace treaties that were both bilateral and multilateral.
Transportation of goods by ship is the most efficient way to carry large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, it is the navy's task to ensure that a country retains the ability to transport people and goods, while the enemy's ability to transport people and goods is hindered.
The US tried to get troops and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to the British, and with this North Atlantic campaign of WWII, this is one of the most remarkable recent examples.
The German navy simultaneously tried to intercept this traffic mainly using U-boats.
Just like the rest of Europe, Great Britain would probably have fallen into German hands if the Allies had failed.
It seems that the goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Iranian Zagros Mountains.
In ancient times, cultures and tribes began to keep them so that they could always easily access their hair, meat, milk, and hides.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds on a hill or other grazing area. They were then guarded by goat herders, just like the more well-known shepherd, often a child or youth. Nowadays, herding is still done in the same way.
As early as the 16th century, horse railways were built in England.
Although horse railways consisted only of plank tracks, the horses had to run increasingly faster and pull larger loads than on the slightly difficult-to-navigate roads of that time.
Crossbeams were used relatively early to hold the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that rails would be more efficient if there were an iron tip on the top.
This quickly became the common practice, but the iron resulted in more wear on the wooden carriage wheels.
Iron wheels eventually replaced the wooden variants. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were laid.
The first form of transport that we know of is walking. Humans began to walk upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus emerged (which means upright man).
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, walked upright less often.
In fossils of the Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, bipedal specializations are found. By the way, the Sahelanthropus may have also walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly, join an environmental movement, or even take action to somewhat alleviate future suffering.
In many cases, it is something like a symptomatic treatment. But if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to identify the cause of the problems and eliminate it.
The scientific and technological developments of human society have clearly and profoundly changed the Earth. Moreover, overpopulation and the extravagant human lifestyle have exacerbated the problems.
After the Declaration of Independence was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent to the printing office of John Dunlap a few streets away. This draft was signed by the President of the Continental Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night. These are now better known as 'Dunlap broadsides.'
John Nixon gave the public reading of the document for the first time on July 8th in the garden of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6 and read to his troops in New York on July 9. Another copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe that a species of dinosaur still exists today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still remind one of a dinosaur.
On their legs are claws and scales, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs, just like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Manipulating data that is encoded in binary digits forms the basis for almost all computers used today.
A binary number can only have two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits (and in computer language 'bits').
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The presence of open boxes of medicines or toxic household chemicals is the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
This group of insects is formally called 'bugs' by entomologists.
This term originates from an age-old agreement with bed bugs, which are insects that are very good at parasitizing humans.
Both red assassin bugs and bed bugs are nest-bound; they have adapted to living in the nest or home of their host.
In the US, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disorder among adults of both younger and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system. This includes the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their interest, or that of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples may choose to put their baby up for adoption.
In an adoption, the parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
Discovering how the world works through the scientific method is the main goal of science. This method is the guideline for most scientific research.
However, it is about more than just experiments; an experiment is a test to exclude one or more potential assumptions, to question and to make observations, as a guide for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and particularly on the Bible in Latin.
The views of Aristotle regarding science, including psychology, were accepted.
The West understood Greek philosophy and science less and less because the knowledge of Greek declined.
In physiological and behavioral observations of rhythms, there is often a strong dependence on endogenous processes and production via the biological clock.
Most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, live according to periodic rhythms. These are not merely reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that undergo a cycle for a specific period of time, even when no external signals are provided for this.
The experiment by Hershey and Chase was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were conducted. In one experiment, the DNA in the phage was labeled with radioactive phosphorus, and in the other experiment, the protein of the phage was labeled with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells are hereditary. Other mutations can cause cells to die or lead to cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who enjoy visiting natural areas because they want to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
On site, one can hunt, fish, take photographs, observe birds, go to parks, and study the ecosystem, among other things.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people from small villages drive to their workplaces and pass people whose workplaces are located in the village they just came from.
Everyone in this dynamic transport shuttle is somehow connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science indicates that due to this enormous carbon economy, the biosphere is no longer in the stable state that allowed human evolution to occur over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about them.
In developed countries, issues with water quality or collapsing bridges rarely occur by comparison.
Why are there so many complaints about transport systems, why do things go wrong daily? Are transport technicians simply incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
In a traffic flow, the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between the individuals are examined.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the traffic flow because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave fairly predictably. This means that traffic flows exhibit some degree of consistency and that there is something to be said about this in mathematical terms.
Connections have been made between the three core characteristics to better represent traffic flow: (1) intensity, (2) density, and (3) speed.
Using these relationships, the planning, designing, and operating of road construction facilities is facilitated.
Insects were the first animals to start flying. Thanks to their ability to fly, they could more easily escape enemies and find food and mating partners more efficiently.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along their bodies.
This allows them to hide from predators in a larger number of small places.
Currently, only dragonflies and mayflies cannot fold their wings.
A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
There were indeed people who thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, and the Sun too (and other stars).
This sounds fairly logical, because you don't feel the earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the world's largest and second longest river, carrying more than 8 times the amount of water as the second largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth and is six miles wide in some places.
At least 20% of all water that flows into the sea via rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. The water comes from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remain unsurpassed in terms of size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monument of their predecessors, which was already more than a thousand years old at that time.
Approximately 800 people live in Vatican City. It is the smallest independent country in the whole world and also the country with the lowest population.
Italian is the official language for communication and laws of Vatican City.
Italian is the language most spoken by the people who work there, while Latin is often used during religious ceremonies.
Everyone who lives in Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People have known the most basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, since ancient times because all of these can be found in nature and it is fairly easy to mine them with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle speculated that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This resembled more what we know from the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also theorized that they transition into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are simply put a combination of at least metals. As you probably know, the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium fall under metals. There are, of course, also metals like silver and gold.
Alloys can also contain a small amount of non-metal elements, for example, carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter consists of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion atoms can fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
That is why the pencil was a faithful friend for many people when it was launched.
The pen has unfortunately been reduced in status as newer writing methods have emerged and is used much less.
Nowadays, people write messages on a computer screen without ever needing a pencil sharpener.
You may wonder what will happen to the keyboard once something new hits the market.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. When the core is split again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means that they fall apart at the slightest disturbance.
The surface of the moon is characterized by dust and rock. The crust is the outermost layer of the moon.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the other side.
The crust is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There are possibly more mares on the side, because the crust is thinner there. Lava could reach the surface more easily there.
Content theories aim to discover what motivates people and what appeals to them.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as they grow up.
With these theories, they want to investigate the reasons why certain people want to have certain things and which environmental factors influence them to do certain things or not.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's Motivation-Hygiene theory.
In general, two courses of action emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. With one course of action, they try to present themselves as equals.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions and take disciplinary measures, conduct evaluation interviews, delegate, and hold people accountable for their responsibilities.
On the other end of the spectrum, this person transforms into an unrecognizable individual. He or she feels the need to change everything the team has done so far and wants to make everything their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to a gap between the leaders and the team members.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards of excellence as normal teams, although there are small differences.
In most cases, virtual team members are the first point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They are often more independent than traditional team members. This is because their teams can meet across different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The idea of a truly 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, pp 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to whom each member reports. The invisible team also sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organization want to embark on the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One of the goals of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and resourcefulness come to light when all available resources are effectively utilized within the functional departments of an organization.
The result of this is that the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
To enable innovation in an organization, management must foster a culture that emphasizes innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
According to Angel (2006), organizations can perform better with an approach based on the continuum model.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating cognition. This allows the research area to be narrowed down and more accurate data to be collected.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injuries, traumas, wounds, and tumors can affect behavior and lead to changes in mental capacity.
Because there are more and more new technologies, we are learning more and more about the structures and processes in the brain.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to develop simulation models that give us more insight into the processes of our mind.
AI immediately makes most people think of science fiction, but it is also an essential part of computer science. It is used in research into machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Developing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior falls under AI research.
Some examples include management, planning, the ability to answer diagnoses and customer questions, and the recognition of handwriting, voice, and face.
These have become separate disciplines for finding solutions to real-life problems.
Nowadays, this artificial intelligence system is frequently used in economic, medical, technical, and military fields, such as in various software applications for PCs and video games.
For each class, many excursions are planned. Often a teacher would take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Thanks to technological developments, virtual excursions are now possible. With these, students can view artifacts in a museum, look inside an aquarium, or see beautiful artworks from the classroom.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a fantastic way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, which is redesigned annually, and previous versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students to write better. Often their grammar and spelling are still poor at the beginning, but this quickly changes because they have an audience.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve the writing and thus avoid criticism.
By blogging, 'students are also forced to learn more about the world around them'. The need to keep the audience interested inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
With proper use, blogs can help students develop analytically and think critically; by actively engaging in discussions on the internet, students can find their own place in the context of others' material and at the same time determine their own stance on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
The bilingual capital of Canada is the charming Ottawa, full of art galleries and museums where Canada is showcased in the past and the future.
Further south, you will find the Niagara Falls. In the north, you will find the beautiful untouched Muskoka and more.
This kind of things makes Ontario appear typically Canadian in the eyes of outsiders.
Further north, vast areas are quite sparsely populated, and some parts of these areas are even virtually uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that will surprise many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than the total population of Canada.
The East African islands are located along the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and in terms of fauna, it is almost a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or are connected with France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought the Islamic faith with them, after which it spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India, marking the beginning of European influence and colonization in the 15th century.
The region borders the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west and the Sahel region to the north.
Women: female travelers are advised to say that they are married, whether it is true or not.
It also helps to wear rings (not ones that look too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to behavior that they perceive as intimidating and that it is common to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be clear when you reject a man and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences don't excuse this!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen. The city was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids and was known by the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the port and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca. After an earthquake in 1755, they left the city again.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and named it Daru l-Bayad. The Spanish traders who established their trading base here gave it the name Casablanca.
In Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Around the old Medina, you will find many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan items, such as tagines, pots, leather goods, water pipes, and other knick-knacks, but it is purely aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The city is located near Rwanda, in the far east.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed when the Nyiragongo volcano spewed lava, burying most of the city's streets, particularly the city center.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, you should check the situation regarding the ongoing fights in the North Kivu province for visits outside Goma.
In addition, the city serves as the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and offers some of the most affordable trips for Mountain Gorilla tracking in Africa.
With a boda-boda (a motorcycle taxi), you can get around in Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese Francs for the short ride.
'Timbuktu' is relatively difficult to access and is nowadays used as a metaphor for exotic, distant countries.
Nowadays, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites due to desert storms.
It was one of the main stops of the PBS exhibition Special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city differs from the other cities in the country, because it has a more Arabic appearance than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and runs east along the border with Mozambique, north along the border with Zimbabwe, and the southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park is 19,500 square kilometers in size, divided into 14 different eco-zones, where various wild animal species are kept.
As a major attraction in South Africa, this park is the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, daily conservation fees and entrance fees apply.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card. These offer access to certain parts of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The entire territory of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, which is considered the main attraction by many tourists.
The large number of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has already been compared to a glittering bar chart revealed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the waterfront of Kowloon across the way.
The vast majority of the population of Hong Kong Island lives very close together on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where the British settlers established themselves, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, you can start well here.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forests in the entire world and stretch 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast into the interior of India and Bangladesh.
The Sundarbans are now officially included on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part within the Indian borders is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are more than just mangrove swamps — they also contain some of the last mighty patches of jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which one third is peat and marshland.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and the area is now estimated to contain 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 axis deer.
During the day, buses depart from the station on the border of the districts (opposite the river). Most leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM, mainly heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang.
It is wise to buy a ticket a few days in advance, because the regional buses are often fully booked.
In most neighborhoods, small Japanese Coaster buses operate, which are comfortable and robust.
With shared taxis, one can travel quickly and comfortably to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and the French Guianese city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters. The building has a length of 378 meters and has two passages with a width of 3.50 meters.
The clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. In August 2011, the construction of the bridge was completed, but it only opened for traffic in March 2017.
According to the schedule, the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017. The Brazilian customs posts are expected to be ready for use by then.
The Guaraní were the most prominent indigenous group. They lived in the area that is now eastern Paraguay, lived as semi-nomadic hunters, and also practiced self-sufficient agriculture.
In the province of Chaco, other indigenous tribes lived, including the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who found their food by hunting, fishing, and gathering.
Paraguay, formerly also known as 'the great province of India', emerged in the 16th century when Spanish colonizers encountered the indigenous population.
A three-century-long period of colonization under the Spaniards followed.
Asunción was founded in 1537 and since then Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Here, smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen at other times of the year.
Check the Asociación Argentina de Polo for more information about tournaments and purchasing tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP). Its value is approximately equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
On the islands, there is only one bank, namely in Stanley opposite the FIC West store. Here you can exchange money.
In general, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley you can often also pay with credit cards and US dollars.
On the remote islands, you probably cannot pay with a credit card, but you probably can with British and American currency. Ask the owners in advance how you can pay.
Exchange your money before you leave the islands because Falkland currency is very difficult to exchange elsewhere.
Montevideo is located below the equator, so when it is summer there, it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. During the summer months, temperatures higher than +30°C can easily occur.
The winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature almost never goes below zero, but the wind combined with the humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
The rainfall level remains approximately the same throughout the entire year, without recognizable 'wet' and 'dry' periods.
Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but wild animals are ultimately still just wild. Therefore, they should not be fed or disturbed.
Maintain at least 100 meters distance from bears and wolves in the park, and 25 meters from all other wild animals.
Moose, bison, reindeer, bears, and nearly all other large animals can attack you, no matter how tame they appear.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Moreover, you should be aware that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid wearing or cooking fragrant food and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia and the city with nearly 40,000 inhabitants is located on the island of Upolu.
Around the year 1850, Apia was founded and it has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain did not want to leave the harbor. This later became known as the notorious stalemate.
With the exception of a British battleship, all ships were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle by the Mau movement, the highest leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, died at a non-violent meeting that got out of hand in the city.
There are many beaches, primarily because of the two harbors of Auckland. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore in the North Harbour district stretch from north to south along the Pacific Ocean, from Long Bay to Devonport.
These are almost all sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and most have pohutukawa trees providing shade.
At Waitemata's harbor, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, located in Central Auckland, you will find the Tamaki Drive beaches.
These family beaches are sometimes crowded and have a good range of shops along the coast. Swimming is not unsafe.
'Number One' is the most important local beer that is not complex, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to be found, but the New Zealand and Australian wines might be better suited for travel.
The local drinking water is safe to drink, but bottled water is also easy to find if you don't trust it.
A 'flat white' is a strange concept for Australians. Black coffee is 'espresso', cappuccino has a lot of milk (without foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality. Fruit juices are expensive, but great.
There are tours to the reef throughout the year, and injuries resulting from these reef tours are rare.
Nevertheless, seek expert advice and follow all signs and safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear from October to April near beaches and river mouths north of the Town of 1770. Sometimes, they also appear outside this period.
Sharks do indeed exist, but they rarely attack people. The majority of sharks are afraid of humans and would actually swim away.
The primary habitat of saltwater crocodiles is located in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton, and they do not normally live in the ocean.
Booking in advance provides peace of mind for the traveler, knowing that he has a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with certain hotels, although you can usually also book other types of accommodation, such as a camping spot, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages with breakfast and transport to and from the airport and sometimes even packages with flight and hotel.
They can also hold your reservation if you want to think about the offer a bit longer or if you need to obtain documents for your destination (e.g., visa).
However, if you have a request or want to make a change, you must do so via the travel agency instead of the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of attendees at music festivals choose to camp on-site, and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to arrive early to secure a camping spot near the music.
And remember the following: even when the music on the main stages has ended, music may still be played in other parts of the festival grounds until the late hours.
For families with young children, some festivals have special camping areas.
Pay close attention to where your cabin is when crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, because the journey through the ice makes an enormous noise if you sit too close.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time to explore the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos generally strive to make the most out of the time and money that guests spend. Windows and clocks are typically not present, and the exit can sometimes be hard to find.
They normally have special offers in the area of food, drink, and entertainment to keep them in a good mood and to prevent them from leaving.
Some locations offer free alcoholic beverages. However, when people are drunk, it affects their judgment, and all seasoned gamblers know that it is extremely important to stay sober.
If you go high into the mountains or drive over mountain passes, you must take into account that there may be snow or ice and the temperature can be incredibly low.
On icy and snowy roads, there is little friction and it drives differently than on asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to get stuck.
Visibility can also be obstructed by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries and do not hinder traffic there.
The biggest tourist attraction in Africa is safaris, which for many visitors are the highlight of their trip.
The term safari, in popular use, refers to traveling overland to observe the beautiful African wildlife, particularly on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars, and standard equipment allows for a good view.
If you want to see lions, cheetahs, and leopards, you need binoculars. Otherwise, the chance of seeing them is small.
A walking safari (also known as a 'bush walk' or 'walking safari') involves walking for several hours or days in a row.
The Paralympics are from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events are held at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Olympic Games twice. The first time was in 1964.
If you have already booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policy varies, but from the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies were no longer valid until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
According to expectations, most tickets for events will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000. Regular tickets will cost around ¥7,000.
You can dry damp clothes by ironing them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available. You can often borrow these items even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can also use a hairdryer, if available.
Make sure that the fabric does not get too hot (this may cause the fabric to shrink or, in extreme cases, scorch).
You can purify water in various ways. Some methods are effective in countering specific risks.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil water for one minute, while in other areas, water must be boiled for several minutes.
Not every filter is equally effective. In case of doubt, it is best to drink water from a sealed bottle from a reliable company.
Travelers may encounter animal infestations that do not exist in their own country.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Normally, infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that injure or kill humans violently, are not considered pests.
Tax-free shopping means that you can purchase goods at certain locations that are exempt from taxes and duties.
Travelers going to countries with high excise duties can sometimes save a considerable amount of money when it comes to products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
Point Marion and Fairmont are connected by the highway from Buffalo to Pittsburgh, and you often drive through desolate backcountry, making this route one big challenge.
Aren't you used to driving on country roads? Then pay attention. You will encounter many steep hills, narrow streets, and sharp turns.
The imposed speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and successive areas — usually around 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and it is even more important to adhere to them here than elsewhere.
Surprisingly, you have much more coverage here than in other corners of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries taste great and in Bavaria the pastries are quite rich and varied, just like the pastries of the southern neighbor, Austria.
You see many fruit tarts there. Throughout the year, the tarts contain apples, and during the summer months, they also include cherries and plums.
Many popular German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and taste great with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but mighty pastries, try some that are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen in the region.
To make a curry, you need spicy and hot ingredients, combined with vegetables or meat.
Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry can be 'dry' or 'wet'.
In the interior of North India and also of Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used instead.
The Indonesian cuisine encompasses dishes from 17,000 islands and is an overarching term for a variety of regional cuisines from across the country.
But without additional information, the term refers to the food that originally comes from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine is now available throughout the archipelago and offers various simply spiced dishes. The most common Javanese flavorings are nuts, peppers, sugar (mainly Javanese coconut sugar), and various fragrant herbs.
Stirrups support the rider's feet and hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but they can also bring safety issues as the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but remains caught with their foot in the stirrup, they can be dragged along with the horse. To reduce the risk, a number of safety measures have been taken.
Most riders first of all wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Some saddles, particularly English saddles, are equipped with safety stirrups. This allows a stirrup leather to detach from the saddle if it is pulled backwards when a rider falls off the horse.
Cochamó Valley - This is Chile's most popular climbing destination. It is known as the Yosemite of South America and has many different large granite walls and rocks.
The mountain peaks offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all parts of the world are constantly discovering new routes on the rock faces, which seem to have endless potential.
Winter sports that involve descending, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular. You glide down a snow-covered slope with skis or a snowboard on your feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, who are sometimes also called 'ski bums', who plan entire holidays around skiing at a particular location.
Skiing has existed for a very long time: there are cave paintings of skiers dating back to 5000 BC!
The beginning of skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational ski resort in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Backpacking with skis: this activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It's not entirely the same, but it's similar to alpine skiing or mountain climbing, which are often done on steep terrain. For this, you need much stiffer skis and boots.
You can see the ski route as a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover greater distances than by walking, but it rarely happens that you reach the speed of cross-country skiing on prepared tracks without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, travelers between different countries have to apply for a visa multiple times and undergo passport controls.
However, the Schengen Area functions in this regard almost as one country.
As long as you remain in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to undergo a passport check again.
When you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that indicates which produced items are considered antiques. Some tax offices define goods that are over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition may vary by location. In North America, for example, the age limit is lower than in Europe.
It is possible to classify artisanal products as antiques, even though they are newer than comparable mass-produced items.
Among the Sámi, reindeer herding is an important form of livelihood. Additionally, the culture surrounding trade is very important for many with other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding. They sustained themselves with fishing, hunting, and similar activities. In this context, reindeer were usually used as draft animals.
Many Sámi today work in modern professions. In Sápmi, the Sámi region, tourism is an important source of income.
The word 'gypsy' is mainly used by non-Roma. However, it is also often considered offensive due to associations with negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions of the Roma.
If a travel advisory is in effect for the country you wish to visit, this may have consequences for your travel health insurance or your cancellation insurance.
You can consult the advice of other governments in addition to the advice of your own government. However, their advice is specifically aimed at their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be confronted with different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Advice includes only a brief summary of the political situation in a single country.
They often provide a fleeting, general, and extremely simplistic view compared to other, more detailed sources.
Extreme weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can lead to damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur all over the world. There are different types of weather conditions, which vary based on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Phenomena and consequences of severe weather include strong winds, hail, large amounts of precipitation, and wildfires, but also thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and hurricanes.
Snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms are among other examples of regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks that severe weather conditions in their area may entail, as these can also affect some travel plans.
Anyone who wants to visit a country that is considered a war zone should receive professional training.
A search for 'course in hostile environments' on the internet will likely provide the address of a local company.
In a course, all issues outlined here are usually dealt with in more detail, often in combination with practical experience.
A course normally lasts 2 to 5 days and consists of role plays, a lot of first aid, and occasionally weapons training.
There are many books and magazines with articles about surviving in the wilderness. However, there are only a few publications about war zones.
Travelers who have planned gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have the correct documentation for their return journey.
It varies greatly whether governments are willing to issue passports that do not specify a gender (X), or to update a name or gender on documents.
There is just as much difference in the willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents.
Searches at security checkpoints have moreover become much more extensive since September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery can assume that they will not go through this scan with intact privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves that break over a reef or something similar and flow onto the beach.
Due to the underwater topology, the return current is located in some deeper parts, where a rapid flow to deep water can occur.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue because they try to swim against the current. This could easily be impossible.
Once you have escaped the strong current, swimming back is a breeze.
Try to focus on a place where you won't be grabbed again. Depending on your skills and whether you have been noticed, you can also wait for help.
The shock of returning is worse than the culture shock (you have less of a 'honeymoon feeling'), it lasts longer, and it can be more intense.
Travelers who easily adapt to new cultures sometimes actually have difficulty readapting to their own culture.
If you have lived abroad and then return, you have adapted to the new culture and in the process lost some habits from your own culture.
In the past, when you went abroad, you noticed that people were patient and understanding because they understood that travelers had to adapt to a new country.
Usually, patience and understanding are not expected for travelers returning home.
For children, the pyramid show with light and sound is among the most interesting activities in the area.
You see the pyramids in the dark and you see them in complete silence before the show begins.
The sound of vendors and tourists is often always audible here. The story of the light and sound is similar to that of a book.
The Sphinx forms the background and is the narrator of a long story.
The scenes appear as a projection on the pyramids and the rest of the pyramids is highlighted.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819 and have since been claimed by various countries. They have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island and Deception. Here you will find the flooded crater of an active volcano that serves as a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth is located on the southern side of the peninsula, near the border with the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula transition into the plateau, after which they reappear to form the 360 km long Mount Ellsworth range, which is traversed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, also known as the Sentinel Range, includes the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif. Mount Vinson is the highest mountain at 4,892 meters.
A satellite phone may be your only option in remote locations where there is no mobile phone reception.
A satellite phone is not really a replacement for a mobile phone, since you have to stand outside with a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
This service is often used by the shipping industry, including pleasure craft, and for expeditions where there is a need for external data and communication.
Your local phone provider can give you more information on how to connect to this service.
It is becoming increasingly popular for people planning a gap year to travel and learn.
Especially school leavers make use of this to take a gap year before university without adverse effects on their education.
Often, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year can increase your chances of returning to higher education in your own country.
Normally, tuition fees must be paid for enrollment in these educational programs.
Finland is a fantastic destination for sailing. The 'Land of a Thousand Lakes' also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelagos off the coast.
A yacht is not necessary for the archipelagos or lakes.
The archipelagos along the coast and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, but with smaller boats or even a kayak, you get a completely different experience.
In Finland, so many people sail in their free time that the ratio of boats to people is one to seven or eight.
The number is equal to the number in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand. Furthermore, it is quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the number is one in forty).
For most Baltic cruises, a long stay in Saint Petersburg (Russia) is included.
This way you can spend several full days in the historic location and stay overnight on the ship.
Since 2009, you do not need a separate visa if you only go ashore during a boat excursion.
For some cruises, a visit to the German capital Berlin is included, but as you can see on the map, Berlin is not close to the sea. A visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be scary for people of all backgrounds and ages, especially if they have never flown before or if they have had a traumatic experience.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from many fears that other people also have.
If you know how airplanes work, this can help alleviate a fear that stems from the unknown or from the fact that you have no control over the airplane.
Courier companies receive a generous compensation to deliver items quickly. For business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for a necessary repair, time often plays a very important role.
Larger companies could deploy their own aircraft for certain routes, but for other routes and smaller companies, it became more difficult.
If they send things by air transport, it can take days on some routes before they are unloaded and clear customs.
Only as checked baggage could this be processed more quickly. According to airline regulations, there must be a corresponding passenger, and that would be you.
The most obvious way to fly in first or business class is to fork over a wad of cash for this privilege (or better yet, have your employer do it).
However, this is not cheap: the rule of thumb is that you pay about four times the economy class for business, and about eleven times for first class.
It generally makes no sense to look for discounts on business class or first-class tickets for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot of money to fly somewhere quickly and comfortably, and the companies charge corresponding costs for this.
Chişinău is the Moldovan capital. The Romanian language is mainly spoken here, but the Russian language is also common.
As a multi-ethnic republic, Moldova was burdened by an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in the east of Moldova. This republic has its own government and currency but is not recognized by the members of the UN.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey with approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the largest port next to Istanbul, and a good transportation hub.
The once ancient city of İzmir is now a modern, developed, and busy commercial center on a bay and is surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the glass buildings, and the modern shopping centers covered with red roof tiles, the 18th-century markets, the old mosques and churches, yet the city feels more like a Mediterranean, European city than traditionally Turkish.
In the village of Haldarsvík, you can enjoy views of the nearby island of Eysturoy, as well as a unique church with eight sides.
On a number of graves near the church, there are fascinating marble dove sculptures.
If you have half an hour, you should definitely take a look around this village.
In the north you will find the easily accessible, romantic, and fascinating place of Sintra. Sintra became famous among foreigners after Lord Byron spoke with praise about the beautiful monuments there.
Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, with a stopover in Cabo da Roca.
Also go north and visit the beautiful Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (a temple complex), where internationally renowned Marian apparitions have taken place.
Remember that you are basically visiting a mass grave, but also a place that holds an almost immeasurable significance for a large part of the world's population.
Many men and women who survived their time here are still alive, and many of them have loved ones who were murdered or worked to death there, both Jews and non-Jews.
During your visit, show all applicable respect, solemnity, and dignity. Do not trivialize the Holocaust or Nazism.
Do not damage the site by applying markings or graffiti to the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the residents prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority can understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most of the signs are in Catalan, because that is the first official language according to the law.
In public transportation and other facilities, Spanish is frequently spoken.
Regular announcements in the metro are only made in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are done by an automated system in several languages, including French, Arabic, Spanish, English, and also in Japanese.
The inhabitants of Paris are known as selfish, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is usually just an incorrect stereotype, it doesn't hurt to put your best foot forward in Paris and behave as someone who is 'bien élevé' (well-mannered). This will make exploring Paris much easier.
The hard exterior of Parisians quickly disappears when you show that you are familiar with their way of doing things.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, and this wooded area mainly consists of beech, fir, and pine, and includes a combination of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
There are an exceptionally large number of different plant communities, due to the different microclimates, the various soil types, and the varying altitude differences.
This area is also the habitat of a very wide range of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat, and the capercaillie can be found, alongside various more common species.
When women visit a monastery, they are required to wear a skirt that extends below the knees and their shoulders must be covered.
Usually you will get a shawl as a woman if you arrive at a monastery unprepared, but if you bring your own version with you, with nicely loud colors, the monk or nun standing at the entrance will smile at you kindly.
On the other hand, men must wear trousers that cover at least down to the knees.
You can also borrow one from the stock at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed every time afterward, so you might not feel comfortable with that. One size fits all for men!
Just like many other Mediterranean regions, Mallorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (particularly pork) and makes extensive use of olive oil.
A simple and popular dish for dinner, especially during the summer months, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and whatever seasonings are available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Nouns, just like Sie which means you, always have a capital letter at the beginning, even if they are in the middle of the sentence.
In this manner, you make a significant distinction between a number of verbs and objects.
It probably also makes reading easier. Nevertheless, writing is more complicated, because you have to figure out whether a verb or adjective should be used as a noun.
Most Italian words are written exactly as they are pronounced, so pronunciation generally poses few problems.
You should pay the most attention to the c and the g. Their pronunciation depends on the vowel that follows them.
You must also pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means darling, while carro means car.
The Persian language has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Reading this introduction to the grammar will already teach you a lot about Persian grammar and help you to understand sentences.
It is quite logical that if you know a Romance language, it is easier for you to learn Portuguese.
But people who speak a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is so similar that you don't need to learn it separately.
Premodern observatories are now obsolete and serve as museums or educational attractions.
Light pollution was not such a big problem back then as it is today, so they were often built in cities or on campuses, more accessible than those of today.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities that are built in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami is the viewing of cherry blossoms and has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
In China, plum blossoms were the favorite flowers, and the concept originated from there.
The first cherry blossom festivals in Japan were organized by the emperor and were intended only for himself and other aristocrats at the imperial court.
Plants look best in a natural environment, so you must resist the urge to remove even 'just one' species.
When you collect samples during a visit to a landscaped garden, you will be immediately and without discussion denied access to the garden.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to stay, very easy to navigate, and virtually everything is available upon arrival.
But if you find yourself in the 'high tropics', just a few degrees north of the equator, you experience both heat (always) and a powerful sun (when the sky is clear, which occurs less often).
There are also some buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the Biblical patriarchs Isaac, Jacob, Abraham, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you are taking actually goes into Hebron and does not just go to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Domestic waterways can be a good vacation destination.
You can, for example, visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, book a cruise to the interesting cities along the Danube, or take a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also indicate popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
People in Christian countries who do not believe, as well as non-Christians around the world, have also adopted many traditions associated with the holiday.
There is a tradition where you stay up all Easter night until you can see the sunrise at a certain point.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could just as well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
In traditional churches, an Easter vigil is often held on the Saturday evening of the Easter weekend, during which congregations often celebrate a feast at the stroke of midnight in honor of the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived at the islands came here by swimming, flying, or drifting.
Due to the long distance from the continent, it was not possible for mammals to make the journey. As a result, the giant tortoise became the most common grazing mammal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans set foot on the Galapagos, various mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
During the winter, the polar night occurs in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, meaning that the sun does not actually rise.
There is a good chance that you can see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be more or less dark day and night.
The areas are sparsely populated, and therefore light pollution is not often a problem. That means you can also enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese work environment is more structured and formal in nature than in the Western world.
Suits are standard work attire, and colleagues address each other by their last name or job title.
Consensus in the workplace is of crucial importance. The focus is on group performance instead of praising individual work achievements.
Employees often need to get approval from their supervisors before they can make a decision, and they are expected to follow the supervisors' instructions unthinkingly.
