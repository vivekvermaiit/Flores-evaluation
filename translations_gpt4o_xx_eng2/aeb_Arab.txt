This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a common theory, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and 3D arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on top and its underside was dark or carotenoid-colored.
The discovery also provides a greater understanding of feather evolution in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed bony series, called the "spine," but they have other features for the feathers - like ridges and small protrusions. Researchers discovered that the spine was mostly an evolutionary development that came later than these other features.
The structure of the wings suggests they were not used for flying but for regulating temperature or display. Researchers propose that although this tail belongs to a small dinosaur, the specimen shows feathers of a large one, not a young chick.
The researchers said that although this is a small dinosaur tail, the integuments show the feathers of an adult bird, not chick feathers.

Scientists have been able to deduce that dark matter affects other dark matter in exactly the same way that natural matter does.
This theory explains that most of the dark matter surrounding a particular galaxy exists in the form of a halo, consisting of many small objects.

Sir Keir Starmer QC, Director of Public Prosecutions, made a statement this morning announcing the trial of Hooney and Bryce.
He resigned and will be replaced in the cabinet by MP Ed Davey. It is expected that MP Norman Lamb will take over the business minister position that Davey will vacate.
Houyeh and Bryce have agreed on an appointment to attend Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16.
The deceased were Nicolas Alden, twenty-five years old, and Zachary Cuddeback, twenty-one years old, with Cuddeback being the one driving.
Edgar Figuela got injured in his hand and mouth, but Christopher Schneider needed reconstructive surgery for his face.
"Sneijder" suffers from continuous pain, one of his eyes became blind, he lost a bit of his skull, and his face was rebuilt with titanium. All of this happened when the "Oka" weapon failed while it was aimed at the head of a fifth man.
Schneider gave his testimony in a video link from an American Air Force base in his country.
After what happened on Wednesday, Carbanedo competes in two individual races in the championship.
Her first race was the slalom race, and she got a "did not finish" result in her first round. 36 out of 116 competitors had the same result in this race.
In her last race - the giant slalom race - she finished in tenth place in the women sitting category with a total running time of 4:41.30, which is 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place Hungarian Gyongyi Dani.
Four skiers from the disabled team failed to complete their rounds, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom race failed to get a ranking in the race.
Police in Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen computer and mobile phone.
The Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjhar, Botha Kanja, Rambro Kanjhar, Gaza Kanjhar, and Vishnu Kanjhar.
Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants attacked the courthouse with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car drove in, they were not hit.
But the driver got a big hit on the head.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed, and emergency services extracted the driver from a red Audi TT.
They first took him to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, they transferred him to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the sheriff's court in Edinburgh accused of killing her son.
She is now suspended awaiting indictment and trial, but any evidence from an eyewitness might be questionable because her photo has been published everywhere.
This is a very common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice operates differently, and the courts have considered that publishing the pictures could be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee says, "I think journalists are heading in a dangerous direction if they publish pictures or anything related to any suspect."
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for the claims, told reporters there would be no further comments until at least an indictment.
The document will show, according to the leak, the dispute over the borders that Palestine wants to be based on the pre-1967 Middle Eastern war boundaries.
Other topics they say were discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which we consider an important issue for both peoples, along with the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands to maintain the military presence in the valley for ten years immediately after the agreement is signed, but the Palestinian Authority agrees to maintain this presence for only five years.
The inspectors needed to increase the close supervision over those who launched the supplementary pest control experiment; the experiment was under observation and they are currently evaluating its effectiveness.
In a partnership between the "National Parks and Wildlife Service" and the "Sporting Shooters Association of Australia," qualified volunteers were selected as part of the association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service's Heritage and Conservation Organization, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation were given safety instructions and comprehensive training.
Yesterday, Martili took the oath in a new temporary electoral council consisting of nine members.
This is the fifth temporary electoral council for Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the temporary electoral council as part of a set of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee was a response to Martelly's wide opposition protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, which sometimes become violent, began because they failed to hold the elections that were supposed to be conducted since 2011.
They reported approximately 60 cases of excessive temperature malfunction in the "iPod" device, resulting in a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last Friday, METI announced that Apple informed them of 34 additional incidents of phones overheating, and the company categorized them as "not serious."
The ministry responded to Apple's postponement request for the report by saying it is "truly unfortunate."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 in the morning local time (Friday 09:19 at night GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office stated that they were not informed of any damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there are no indicators of a possible tsunami wave occurring.
A former Filipino policeman hijacked a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took two tourists as hostages from Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 weapon at the tourists.
Many hostages were rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages were released early, including children and elderly people, along with the Filipino photographers.
Then the photographers took the old woman's spot because she needed to go to the bathroom. And they shot Mendoza.
Legris followed his father and worked as a doctor.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
He started "Legins" investigating premature births in his free time, while he was working at the hospital.
The research showed that administering a hormone accelerates the maturation of the fetus's lungs.
Xinhua said that government investigators found the flight recorders called the "black box" on Wednesday.
The wrestler colleagues spoke well of Louna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first extreme queen. My first manager, Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. A very strong woman, one of a kind."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said: "Luna was eccentric like me... and maybe more than me... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Among 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the proportion of those opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those surveyed agree with this viewpoint and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Regarding the two conflicting opinions in the poll, 29% of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The fitness of the Olympic gold medalist has become questionable due to his complaints, and he was required to swim 100 m and 200 m freestyle in three stages at the Commonwealth Games.
He can't take the necessary medication to reduce the pain because its use is banned in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Many people verified the discovery using various devices and software at the beginning of February and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water delivery to Earth along with organic materials that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists want to understand how planets formed, particularly how Earth formed from the time comets collided with Earth long ago.
Komo, who is 53 years old, began his term at the start of this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He said about the rumors that they are "political gossip and nonsense."
He might run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration says will allow planes to fly shorter routes, save millions of liters of kerosene each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-linked technology, unlike the old technology that uses ground radar, allowing air traffic controllers to pinpoint the airplane's location more accurately and provide pilots with more specific information.
There are no additional transportation means, and the underground trains will not stop at Wembley, and there are also no parking spaces, parking facilities, or transport stations.
The fear of a lack of transport options raised the possibility that the match might be held without spectators.
A study released on Thursday in the journal "Science" mentioned the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in America and Uppsala University in Sweden said that the evolution of new species took just two generations, although they believed this process would take much longer, due to the interbreeding between the endemic Darwin finch, the medium ground finch, the cactus finch migrant, and the large ground finch.
Gold can be shaped into many forms. It can be turned into small shapes.
It can also be drawn into a thin thread that can be twisted and braided, or it can be hammered or shaped into sheets.
You can make it very thin, and attach it to another metal. It can be so thin that it was used at times to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
The chemical substance's pH number is referred to, and you can make an indicator for this number with red cabbage juice.
The color of red cabbage juice changes according to the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical substance.
The pH level is measured by the number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance you want to test.
Hydrogen ions are protons stripped of electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the dry powders together and squeeze them with clean, wet hands until they form into a ball.
The moisture on your hands interacts with the outer layers, giving you a strange feeling and forming a sort of covering.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with a drainage system in almost every house, connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems were found in the homes of Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths that both men and women attended together.
When you communicate with someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it almost instantly.
The satellite is sent to space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and vision.
The task requires a giant rocket more than 100 feet tall to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel changed the shape of the world in an impressive way; however, providing an easier and faster means of transportation remains the most important contribution it made to us.
She brought us the train, the car, and many other transportation devices.
Below them, there are other medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging between rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
There are many small cats (including stray house cats) that prey on smaller animals that are more numerous, like insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of status, a special role for each cat that prevents it from competing with others.
Black cats are the most social cats and live in large groups called prides.
The lion family consists of one male to three adult males, with females and cubs bringing their number to thirty.
Usually, females are closer to each other because they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
The pride of lions behaves like a pack of wolves or dogs, and surprisingly these animals resemble a lion (but not other big cats) in behavior and kill their prey.
Being a comprehensive athlete, the tiger can climb (even if not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with a strength five times that of a human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-throated roar of the lion; it's closer to shouting with angry words.
The dwarf leopard likes to eat small animals and hunts monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if it can. Almost all the animals hunted by the dwarf leopard are smaller than it.
Scientists believe that desert cats track and hunt animals by smell; they can even detect where they were on the ground.
You can see well in the dark with night vision capability, and it also moves stealthily. The small tiger hunts its prey by hiding in its environment and pouncing on them.
When we separate a small group of organisms (a small number of individuals) from the main population they belong to (for example, if they moved across a mountain range or a river, or moved to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
Given that this new environment contains different resources and competitors, the newly established group needs different characteristics or adaptation methods to become a stronger competitor compared to its previous strength requirements.
There has been no change at all for the indigenous people, and they still need the same adaptation methods as we have always known them.
Over time, as new residents begin to adapt to their new environment, they gradually become less similar to other residents.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups become so different that we can no longer say they are of the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is considered an inevitable result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans emit (i.e., exhalation).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat also comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaur was the dominant predator of its time, which is why it wasn't afraid of anything, except other mosasaurs.
The long jaws it had were studded with more than 70 blade-like teeth, along with another set on the roof of the mouth, which means that there was nothing in its way that could escape from it.
We don't know exactly, but maybe it had a forked tongue. Its diet includes turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and it might have been carnivorous.
And everything that goes into water was attacked; even a giant dinosaur like T. Rex couldn't handle it.
Despite the fact that most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans have their share of unusual or extraordinary festive elements, such as wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their meals seated on chairs, the rich men liked to hold feasts together and would recline on their sides when they ate.
Ancient Roman meals did not include the foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have beans, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and the ancient Romans didn't eat turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
People used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to serve the gods during festivals and holidays.
Every temple has an open courtyard leading to a sanctuary that only priests can enter.
Unique tower structures shaped like pyramids called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a safe haven for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house did not have great importance.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
The women used to cook in the courtyard of the house, the shops were just counters open to the street. And they used stone to build the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, that's why wood was expensive.
Humans settled Greenland in scattered groups. The Norse sagas tell how Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland on charges of murder, and how he traveled west, found a land, and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes used to live there previously.
There were significant differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history in the countries of "Denmark," "Sweden," "Norway," and "Iceland," although they were all "Scandinavian."
If you've watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was depicted on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Although there is something written on the back of the paper, it's not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence is the phrase "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text appears upside down at the bottom of the page.
Although the author of this part of the text is not specifically known, we do know that the large manuscript (measuring 29¾ inches × 24½ inches) was initially stored folded.
So, it's likely that the code was simply added as a label.
The landing operations on the fateful day and the battles that followed led to the liberation of northern France, but the south had not been liberated at that time.
France was ruled by "Vichy." It was the French people themselves who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and they named the invasion operation "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans had liberated the French Free Forces in southern France, and they were heading to Germany.
Civilization is a shared individual culture among a large group of people who live and work cooperatively and together.
The origin of the word "civilization" is from the Latin "civilis," which means "civil," and is related to the Latin "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning "city" or "city-state," which also determines the way of the social structure.
Self-governing cities are akin to the ancestors of nations. Civilizational culture means the transfer of knowledge across many generations with a lasting cultural imprint and the dissemination of knowledge in a fair manner.
Many small cultures fade away without leaving actual historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government, and there was only the Congress under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the state authorities, which were mostly uncooperative, to enforce all the laws.
Moreover, he did not have the authority to override the tax laws and tariffs imposed between the states.
The materials required unanimous approval among all the states before they were amended, and the states mocked the central government to the extent that their representatives were always absent.
The Italian national team, along with the German national team, are the second most successful teams in the world in football and were the world champions in football in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, and the Italians have been competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has around 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu Island), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that Japan possesses, it is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical perspective.
Taiwan began to make its return in the fifteenth century, and European sailors who passed by it called it Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began altering indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) dominated the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War from 1894 to 1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu city consists of three main buildings, which are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the House of the Three Windows.
Most of the existing buildings have been reconstructed on the edges of the complex to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
In 1976, they recovered thirty percent of Machu Picchu, and restoration work has continued to this day.
For example, the format for shooting still images known worldwide is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
Its production is still ongoing to this day, but most importantly, the image sensors in digital cameras have the same aspect ratio.
The 35 mm model is actually a bit confusing, with a width of 36 mm and a height of 24 mm.
The aspect ratio of this image (when we divide by 12 to get the simplest whole number ratio) is 3:2.
This aspect ratio corresponds to or approximates many common formats (like the set of advanced image formats).
The misuse of triangulation, which is often mocked, forms a simple guiding principle that creates dynamics while maintaining a degree of order in a clear picture.
The most impactful place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three vertically and horizontally (see the example).
The Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, underwent scrutiny during this period of European history.
The Christian religion connected European countries with each other for more than a thousand years despite differences in language and customs.
The overall power that she possessed impacted everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds exist specifically for this reason.
The central authority was for the church in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money raised questions for many people about the fulfillment of the faith's requirements.
Britain quickly began blockading Germany by sea after the skirmishes started.
The strategy has proven its effectiveness; cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violates the international law generally in force, which has been recorded and coordinated in several international agreements in the past two centuries.
The UK mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire sectors of the oceans, which even threatened neutral ships.
And because the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the twenties of the last century, the prevailing attitudes among most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the countries wanted to avoid this situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America to work with Edison's company in New York City.
He arrived in America with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his previous manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each dynasty or ruling family was of a different kind.
Additionally, between every ruling dynasty, there was an unstable era of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these times, a fierce war broke out between many nobles to seize the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, and thousands of people died in wars to seize the highest positions in the grand palace in Xian.
There are many social and political impacts such as the use of the metric system, the transition from autocracy to a republican system, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not just the ruler alone.
After the revolution, professions were open to all male applicants and those with more ambition were allowed to succeed more than others.
And the same thing applies to the army, because the army's classifications, instead of being based on class, are now based on calibers.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to ignite their own revolutions.
Mohamed was very interested in matters that transcend this worldly life, and he got used to visiting a cave that would later be called "Hira" on Mount "Al-Nour" to meditate.
This cave, which has endured through the ages, gives us a clear and vivid picture of Prophet Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the summit of a mountain in the north of Mecca, and it is very isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, finding it wasn't easy even if you knew it existed. And once you enter the cave, you become completely isolated.
You can only see the clear beautiful sky above the mountains in the place. And you can neither hear nor see except a few things from this world inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid in the "Giza" Governorate is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands to this day.
It was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC. The Great Pyramid is also one of the large pyramids built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead has many pyramids (the Great Pyramid is the largest one), small tombs, temples, and the Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up-bow" symbol resembles the letter V, and the "down-bow" symbol resembles a stapler or a square without the bottom side.
An upper sign means you have to start from the ends and push the bow, while a lower sign means you have to start from the end of the bow (meaning you hold the bow with your hands) and pull it.
The upper bow usually produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger.
Don't hesitate to draw your marks with a pencil, but don't forget that the printed crooked marks are there for a musical reason, that's why you usually need to respect them.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their young children (Marie Thérèse, who was 11 years old, and Louis Charles, who was four years old), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, found themselves forced to return from Versailles to Paris amidst a crowd of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by many people shouting and calling out against the king and queen.
A group of fans succeeded in forcing the king and queen to open their palace gates.
One of the gang members at a certain time threw the head of a killed member of the royal guard in Versailles in front of the shocked queen.
The Filipino people are the ones who bore the costs of America's imperial war when it invaded the Philippines.
These people were forced to pay taxes to the American colonizer to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government on Wall Street.
And of course, the very large profits that come from exploiting the Filipino people for a long period will be the main gain for American imperialism.
We need to understand the context that allowed the organization to exist, so we can comprehend the Knights Templar.
The era in which those events took place was called the High Middle Ages, which is a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages came before the Early Middle Ages and after them the Late Middle Ages, which all ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological drive or necessity to the certain feeling that there is an essential logic related to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology that controls the fate of humanity.
There are two common general ideas in the majority of explanations of technological determinism: that the development of technology itself follows a path that largely surpasses cultural or political influence, and that this technology also has "effects" on established societies, not related to the society.
For example, there are those who say that the car engine will lead us to the development of roads.
However, building a network of roads for the whole country for just a few cars does not bring economic profit, which is why new roads are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The collective ownership of cars also increases the rate of road accidents, and this generates new techniques in healthcare to treat injured bodies.
Romanticism had a significant influence on the cultural determinism brought by writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of the romantic movement, geography is what brought people together, and over time, the customs and culture related to that geography emerged, and these were, as they were in harmony with the place of society, better than the laws imposed by force.
Paris is also famous for being the fashion capital of the contemporary world, while Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It began to be renowned as a center of luxury in the year 400 AD and remained so until the year 1100 AD.
Its value fell in the twelfth century due to the return of the Crusades, which brought back their goods like silk and spices that had more value than what was available in the Byzantine markets.
At that time, Paris was named the fashion capital in place of Constantinople.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 14th centuries.
At first, Byzantine culture in the East had a significant influence on things.
And despite that, due to the slowness in communication channels, trends in the West can be delayed by about 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments at that time was the use of locks by the Crusades as people began to use locks to secure their belongings.
Subsistence farming is the type of farming that is done to produce enough food to sustain the farmer and their family only.
Subsistence farming - which is mostly organic - is a simple system where stored seeds that match the area's climate are used, along with crop rotation or other easy techniques to increase production.
Most of the farmers worked early in subsistence farming, and this situation still exists in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who think alike and feel neglected by societal norms, allowing them to develop their sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, race, class, location, and/or the gender of the members.
The characteristics that define the uniqueness of a subculture might be language, appearance, religion, politics, gender, geography, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures express their membership through their clothing, behavior, and the language they speak.
Among the well-known methods that are often used to demonstrate the importance of socialization, they rely on some chronic cases of children who suffered when they were neglected or had unfortunate circumstances, or were intentionally harmed, and who were not socially connected with adults during their upbringing.
These children are called "wild" or feral. Some people have taken in some of these lost children (usually their parents); in some cases, the neglect of the children was due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Wild children may have been subjected to bad treatment or severe trauma during their childhood before being neglected or running away.
And there are others who say that they were raised by animals; and a few others say that they lived alone in the forest.
When raised by non-human animals, the wild child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) exactly resembling those of the foster animal, such as fear of humans or ignoring them.
Although project-based learning is supposed to make the learning process easier and more significant, support goes beyond this.
Interactive learning is not a method of learning, but rather a supportive tool that provides assistance to individuals who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Interactive learning can be both virtual and in-person; in other words, the teacher is a form of interactive learning, as is the paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Interactive learning is supported internally in the program and aims to ask questions, motivate, and explain procedures that may be difficult for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons ranging from neglect and abuse to exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment that doesn't focus on upbringing, care, and education, but they are growing up like that.
He knows that the foster care system is considered a safe zone for children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care must provide all the necessities that were missing in the homes they left before.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and personal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage approaches and methods of satisfaction.
For example, some suggest "learning" and "socialization" as important motivations for using the Internet (James and others, 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were identified as new motivational aspects by Amy and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries in the field of interpreting micro-expressions of the face, which are facial movements that last for a few fractions of a second.
And they say especially that one can discover if a person is lying when they interpret small expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks indicated in his paper that the president's speech suggests that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage can accurately assess honesty.
Additionally, he touched on the idea that these abilities in analyzing human behavior are shared with some animals, like domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown the existence of two groups of genetic variations: a hidden group and an apparent one.
Mutations introduce new genetic variations, and selection eliminates them from the pool of expressive differences.
Recombination and segregation make the variation randomly shuffle between the two groups with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for primates with a digestive system similar to humans to meet their amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Failure in this will lead to severe consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The plant resources that are easily accessible in abundance are proteins that can be obtained from leaves and legumes, but these proteins are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, animal foods (ants, termites, and eggs) are not as easy to digest, but they provide high amounts of proteins and contain all essential amino acids.
When you take everything into consideration, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors somehow solved the "protein problem" like chimpanzees in the savanna.
Waking interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your natural sleep period and sleeping again after a short period (from 10 to 60 minutes).
You can do this easily if you use a gentle alarm that will bring you back to your senses without waking you up all at once.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm while you're sleeping, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options, based on biological systems, include drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, one of the well-known diuretics) before bed, so the person will wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The less tension, the more positivity the force of life gives. Everyone has the inherent ability to find complete peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that prevents it is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has extended through the Mahayana path of love and other techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and a path of love that embraces everyone.
The "Kundalini" energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, chanting, and visualizations with "Kundalini Yoga."
Tibetan meditation center is the deity yoga. By visualizing the different deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the enlightenment consciousness is generated.
Germany represented a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. However, by the end of the war, the clash of systems, policies, and cultures led to the outbreak of the conflict between the two states.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies now, and the Cold War began.
The war was supposed to last forty years ahead, with the battlefields being contested by proxy armies, in arenas extending from Africa to Asia, including Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense fell and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Roman bridge.
Nevertheless, these plans became obsolete overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of cargo ships is considered the most efficient way to transport many people and goods across the oceans.
Traditionally, the mission of the naval forces is to ensure your country's ability to transport its people and goods, while at the same time disrupting your enemy's ability to transport their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II, where the Americans tried to transport people and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to assist Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to counter this invasion by using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, most likely Germany would have entered Britain like it did with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated nearly 10,000 years ago in the Iranian Zagros Mountains.
Ancient cultures and tribes started raising them because they easily provide milk, hair, meat, and skins.
The nanny goats were generally raised in herds grazing on hills or other pastures, often shepherded by goat herders who were mostly children or teenagers, like the well-known ordinary shepherd. These grazing methods are still in use today.
The maps were made in England in the 16th century.
Although the old railway carriages were made of parallel planks, they allowed horses to pull them faster and carry heavier loads compared to the tracks that were considered very difficult at that time.
They invented the iron for train tracks a bit early to fix the tracks, but it later turned out over time that placing an iron line above the track made it more efficient.
What became a common tradition is that the steel sticks of the caravans were all eaten.
In the end, they replaced the wooden wheels with iron wheels. In 1767, they used the first fully iron bars.
Walking was the first means of transportation; humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning "upright man").
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not walk upright consistently.
They found legged species in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus might have walked on its legs seven million years ago.
We can start living in a way that is more in harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be active in order to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is exactly like treating the symptoms in many cases. And with that, if we don't just want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems, and we need to put an end to it.
It is very clear that the world has changed a lot due to scientific and technological advancement for humanity, and the problems have increased due to overpopulation and the luxurious nature of human life.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft corrected by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the nearby John Dunlap's printing press.
In the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on the eighth of July.
One of them was sent to George Washington on the sixth of July, and he read it to his forces in New York on the ninth of July. A copy of it reached London on the tenth of August.
The Dunlap broadsides, totaling twenty-five, represent the oldest surviving copies of the American Declaration of Independence document, but the original handwritten version did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today, which we call birds.
Many don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many things about birds that show up like dinosaurs.
It has legs with outer protective layers and claws, lays eggs, and walks on consecutive legs like a Tyrannosaurus.
All computers used today virtually rely on processing encoded information in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, which are 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary numbers - or bits, if we used computer terminology.
Internal poisoning symptoms might not appear immediately. An immediate diagnosis cannot be made when symptoms like vomiting, which are generally common enough, appear.
The best indicator of internal poisoning could be the presence of a bag of dissolved medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Look at the poster to learn about the first aid instructions for the specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "bugs" in its official sense to refer to this group of insects.
This word comes from the ancient knowledge of bed bugs, which are insects that have significantly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both the "kissing bug" and "bed bug" are known for their long incubation period and adapt to living in their host's nest or dwelling.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most widespread neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that the likelihood of females developing multiple sclerosis is twice that of males.
A couple might decide that it's not in their best interest or their child's best interest to raise a baby.
These couples may choose to develop an adoption plan for their children.
In the adoption process, the original parents terminate their parental rights so that two other spouses can take care of the child.
The main goal of science is to understand the way the world works through a scientific method. This approach actually guides most scientific research.
Although it is not unique in this regard, experimentation and testing are considered a means to refute one or more of the possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, particularly on the Bible in Latin.
I accepted Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology.
At the time when knowledge declined among the Greeks, the West found itself isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend on autonomous cycles, produced by biological clocks.
The periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue for periods of successive cycles even when there are no external influences.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to introduce their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to label either the phage nucleic acid using radioactive phosphorus or its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells or not.
Mutations in germ line cells can only be transmitted to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas who want to enjoy the scenery, including plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of activities that can be done at the fishing site include fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
Example of visiting, photographing, and learning information about this type of monkey (orangutan) in Borneo.
People leave small towns in their cars every morning to go to work, and they are met on the road by other workers in the place they just left.
In this vibrant mode of transport, everyone somehow supports and is connected to a transportation system based on private cars.
Current science points out that this massive carbon-dependent economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transportation systems. Everyone complains about the transportation systems.
It is rare to hear in developed countries such levels of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers not competent? Or is there something more fundamental happening?
Traffic movement is the study of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic movement is difficult because you cannot predict the driver's behavior one hundred percent.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable pattern; that's why traffic enjoys a reasonable pattern and can be mathematically approximated.
To better clarify the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
The insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape from enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are characterized by their ability to fold their wings back along their bodies.
And this gives them a larger range of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that can't fold their wings today are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some saw that he was right, but many people thought the opposite; that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This thing seems logical, because you don't feel the earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest river in the world. It has more than eight times the water of the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, reaching a width of 9.66 km in some places.
20% of the water that flows into the oceans from the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Despite the fact that the construction of the pyramids with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom of Egypt, the pyramids in Giza were unmatched in terms of size and artistic distinction in construction.
The Egyptians of the Modern Kingdom were amazed by the ancestors’ monuments, which remained for over a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world with the least population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of daily life used by most of the state's workers, while Latin is usually used in religious ceremonies.
All the residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, where all these elements can be found in nature in their native form and can be extracted relatively easily using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle hypothesized that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it assumes that they transform into new materials to form what we observe.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered minerals. And there are naturally occurring minerals like silver and gold as well.
You can also obtain alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything created in the universe is made of matter. All materials are made from small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them can fit into the space of the dot at the end of this sentence.
The pencil was a good friend to many people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing tools, the use of the pencil has decreased, and its status has diminished.
People now write messages on PCs without using pens.
The person wonders what the keyboard will become when something newer comes out.
The fragmentation bomb works on the basis that it gathers energy to form a nucleus filled with protons and neutrons.
Like rolling a heavy cart over a hill. The core splits again, releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to disintegrate with slight movement or without it.
The surface of the moon is composed of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 kilometers wide on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
Lower the display under Maria and display under the heights.
There may still be lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface.
You search the content theories for something that grabs or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that emerge on their own as they reach maturity.
These theories explore what makes some people like the things they do and the factors in their surrounding environment that make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories about content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when managers start leading their former colleagues, one of which is trying to remain like the others.
This type of managers faces difficulty in making poor decisions, implementing disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding individuals accountable.
On the other hand, a person turns into someone you no longer recognize, feeling that they need to change everything the team was doing and owned.
In the end, the leader is the main person responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team members.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of the virtual team often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical groups.
Most of the time, they had greater independence than traditional team members, where their teams could be spread across different time zones that might not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "hidden team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is described as a unique component of a virtual team.
Every member submits their reports to the management team "the invisible team" where the "invisible team" sets the criteria for each member.
Why does a certain organization want to establish an educational organization in a process that takes a long time? Innovation is one of the goals of applying the concepts of institutional learning.
When all available resources are efficiently utilized across the organization’s departments, we can see creativity and skill.
And as a result, this can enhance synergy within the organization to overcome obstacles in implementing new innovative measures that meet the clients' needs.
Before an organization can innovate, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuity method as a way used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neuroscience-related data provides tangible evidence for the theoretical approach in epistemological research. This helps to narrow down the research area and make it much more precise.
The researchers are supported in their studies of the connection between neuropathology and behavior.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The new technologies allow us to see and explore brain structures and processes in a way we haven't known before.
This provides us with a lot of information and resources to create simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Despite the fact that artificial intelligence has a strong connotation of science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
Research in artificial intelligence involves creating machines to perform tasks that require intelligent behavior automatically.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnostics and questions, and additionally, it recognizes handwriting, voice, and face.
These things have become separate fields focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is now used in the economy, medicine, engineering, and the military, just as they use it to make many applications on the home PC or video games.
Field trips are considered a significant part of any department. Many times, the teacher would like to take her students to places, but traveling there by bus is not an option at all.
Technology provides a solution through virtual field trips. Students can see the artifacts in the museum, visit the aquarium, or enjoy beautiful art while sitting with their classmates in the classroom.
Increasingly, taking a virtual field trip is a great way to remember a specific trip and exchange experiences with the upcoming classes.
For example, students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website each year for their trip to the state capital, and this site is redesigned every year, but they keep the old versions online to serve as a register.
Blogs can also contribute to improving the students' writing. When students usually start their blogging experience with incorrect grammar and spelling, having an audience generally makes a difference.
And since students are mostly the audience that criticizes, the blogger starts looking to improve their writing to avoid being criticized.
The blogs compel students to become smarter than their surroundings. The need to capture the audience's attention inspires students to be skillful and useful. (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that facilitates collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can "enable students to become more capable in analysis and criticism; and by effectively responding to what is online, students can determine their positions regarding what others write, as well as form their own opinions on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the enchanting capital of Canada, with two languages and a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
The Niagara Falls can be found in the far south, and in the north, we find the beautiful nature house that is not utilized in Maskuka and beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as what is considered the Canadian thing to foreigners.
The large areas in the north are regions that are somewhat sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited.
For the sake of comparison that astonishes many: The population of African Americans residing in the United States is greater than the number of Canadian citizens.
The East African islands in the Indian Ocean are located off the eastern coast of Africa.
The island of Madagascar is the largest, and it is an independent continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent countries, or linked to France, and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the country and spread it widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence and European colonization began in the fifteenth century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a route from Europe to India via the Cape.
From the north, the African coast borders the area, and it is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean from the south and west.
Regardless of their marital status, women who are traveling must declare that they are married.
Wearing a ring is very beneficial (but not the one that is very expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to what is considered harassment, and that they are used to being stared at or grabbed by the arm, and more.
Stay firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to hold steadfast in your opinion (don't let cultural differences be something acceptable!).
The Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids used the new city of Casablanca as a strategic port called "Anfa," after its establishment on the Berber sailors' route in the 10th century BC.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it, naming it "Casablanca," to flee from it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city, naming it "Dar Al-Badia," and the Spanish traders called it "Casablanca" as they established trading posts there.
Casablanca is considered one of the places in Morocco where people shop the least.
It is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods throughout the old city, like tagines, pottery, leather, hookahs, and all kinds of cheap goods, but all of it is aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from Mount Nyiragongo destroyed Goma, covering most of the city's streets, especially the downtown area.
Any trip outside of Goma requires research to understand the ongoing war situation in North Kivu province, while Goma itself is relatively safe.
The city is considered a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and some of the cheapest routes to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can take a boda boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma, and the usual fare (locally) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Apart from the fact that it's a bit difficult to reach, "Timbuktu" has come to be used when talking about strange and distant lands.
The city of Timbuktu is now considered a poor city, despite its reputation making it a tourist attraction, and it also has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger because of the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops for Henry Louis Gates in the PBS series on the special wonders of the African world.
The city contrasts sharply with the rest of the country's cities because it has a more Arab character than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park area is 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each with its own unique wildlife.
It is considered one of the attractive places in South Africa, and its park is also considered one of the main national parks in South Africa (South African National Parks).
There are daily permits to maintain the park and enter it, like all national parks in South Africa.
It might be useful for you to buy a Wild Card, as it grants you access to a select group of South African parks or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the Hong Kong region its name and is the place that is considered the destination for many tourists.
The stacked buildings depicting the Hong Kong skyline resemble a dazzling chart appearing above the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonizers made as their own, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the area, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is considered the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) in the remote areas of Bangladesh and India's coast.
It was announced that Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps; they contain some of the last remaining dense jungle evidence that once covered the Ganges River plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 square kilometers, about one-third of which is covered by water/swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the region.
The intercity buses leave the station (across the river) at noon, although most of them, especially those headed east and to Jacar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses between the neighborhoods are often full, it's advisable to buy the tickets in advance a few days before.
Most areas are served by small Japanese "Coaster" buses, which are comfortable and strong.
The shared taxi is a fast and comfortable means of transportation to nearby places, like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the city of Oiapoque in Brazil with Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The height of the tower is 83 meters, and its length is 378 meters, with two lanes each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, and it only opened to traffic in March 2017.
It is decided that the bridge will start operating at full capacity in September 2017, at the same time the Brazilian customs points are expected to be completed.
The "Guarani" were the most important indigenous group living in what is known today as Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes like the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting animals, gathering plants, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, which was previously known as "the Giant Province of the Indies," emerged as a result of the confrontation between Spanish settlers and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonial era that lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competitions of the year are held in December at the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Moreover, you can watch the smaller leagues and matches here at other times of the year.
To get news of tournaments and places to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged at the same value as the British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley on the other side of the FIC West shop.
The British pound is generally accepted almost everywhere on the islands, as are Stanley's credit card and the US dollar in many instances.
In remote islands, there might be a chance they won't accept credit cards, although they may accept British and American currency; check with the owners beforehand to know how to pay.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, which is why the money must be exchanged before leaving the islands.
And since Montevideo is located south of the equator, the summer there will be like the winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical regions; it's normal for temperatures to exceed 30 degrees Celsius during the summer months.
Winter can be cold at times: it's rare for temperatures to fall below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make the weather feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
The amount of rainfall remains almost constant throughout the year, with no distinct "rainy" or "dry" seasons.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wildlife is ultimately wild, and you should not feed or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may appear, bison, deer, moose, and bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Dozens of visitors get injured every year because they don't maintain a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and considered dangerous, which is why you need to give them their own space.
Additionally, be careful because the smells attract bears and other wild animals, so don't carry or cook fragrant food and keep the campsite clean.
The city of Apia is the capital of Samoa, and it is located on the island of Upolu, with a population of slightly less than 40,000 people.
Apia was established in the 1950s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was a place of bad naval confrontations in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships sank except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German people drowned.
During the struggle organized by the Mao Movement for independence, a peaceful assembly in the town resulted in the killing of the supreme leader, Tupou Tamasesi Liloafe III.
Due to the presence of "Auckland" between two bays, there are many beaches, the most popular are located in three places.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are located on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and swimming there is safe, and most of them are shaded by pine trees.
Tamaki Drive is located on a headland between the bays of Mission and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These family beaches can be crowded at times and have a nice variety of shops lined up along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The basic popular beer is known as "Number One," it's not a complex drink, but it brings pleasure and refreshment. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many types of French wine, but New Zealand and Australian wine are much better.
Local tap water is drinkable, but it's easy to find bottles of water if you're concerned.
For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is strange. The small black coffee is an "espresso", while the cappuccino has a layer of cream on top, not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets the Belgian standards. The fruit juices are excellent although they are expensive.
Many trips go out to the coral reefs throughout the year, and the coral reefs are rarely affected for any of these reasons.
Despite this, seek advice from the authorities, follow all the signals, and pay close attention to the safety warnings.
The Atlantic bonito is found near the coasts and river mouths from October to April north of 1770. It can occasionally be found outside these times.
The rokan exists, but it rarely attacks humans. Most rokan are afraid of humans and run away if they see one.
Saltwater crocodiles do not usually live in the ocean; their primary habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
The reservation reassures the traveler that they will have a place to sleep as soon as they reach their destination.
Although you might find that you can reserve other forms of accommodation, like camping spots, through a travel agent, travel agents often have deals with specific hotels.
It is customary for travel agents to offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even bundled packages with flights and accommodation.
Just like they can keep your reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to get other documents for your destination (like the visa).
Nevertheless, you must send any changes or requests through the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, most attendees at music festivals decide to camp at the site and consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to get close to the events, you need to arrive early to get a camping spot near the music.
Remember that although the music may have ended on the podium, there are festival parties that continue the music until late at night.
Some festivals include camping areas specifically for families with young children.
When crossing the northern Baltic Sea region in winter, it's necessary to check the cabin's location, as ice passage causes high sensitivity especially for those more affected and alone.
St. Petersburg cruises include spending some time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa entry requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually work hard to increase the time and money guests spend. There are usually no windows or clocks, and you might find it difficult to locate doors leading outside.
They have a tradition of special meals, drinks, and entertainment shows to keep the good guests satisfied and draw them inside.
Some places offer free drinks, but intoxication greatly impairs proper judgment, and all true gamblers know the importance of gambling while sober.
Anyone driving their car at high altitudes or over mountain passes must consider the possibility of snowfall, ice, or subzero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there isn't much friction, and you can't drive on a slippery road.
During snowstorms, a quantity of snow can fall that stops you for a short time.
Snow, hailstorms, or ice that accumulates on car windows can reduce visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and circulation usually continues throughout the year without stopping.
Safari trips might be the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most prominent for many visitors.
The term safari is usually used to refer to travel within the country to see the amazing wildlife in Africa, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, get very close to cars and standard equipment allows you to watch them well.
Lions, leopards, and tigers sometimes feel shy, and you may see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as "jungle tour" or "walking tour" or "the tour") consists of hiking, either for a few hours or many days.
The Paralympic Games will be organized from August 24 to September 5, 2021, and some events of the games will be held in different places in various regions of Japan.
