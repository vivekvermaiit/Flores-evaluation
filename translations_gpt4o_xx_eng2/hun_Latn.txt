This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, as that theory had already spread earlier, but also sheds light on details that fossils are generally unable to reveal - such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was chestnut brown on top, with light or orangish shades on the sides.
The discovery might also provide insights into the evolution of birds' plumage.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have well-developed shafts, which are called quills, but possess other characteristics of feathers—such as barbs and down—the researchers concluded that quills are likely a result of later evolutionary development compared to these features.
The structure of the feather suggests that it was used not for flight, but for thermoregulation or display. Researchers determined that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample indicates adult plumage, rather than chick plumage.
The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen implies adult plumage rather than chick plumage.

The work carried out was fundamentally theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations conducted on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The professional group attempted to prove the existence of an interaction between the tidal phenomenon of dark matter in the galaxy and the tidal phenomenon of dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way similarly affects the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter throughout the galaxy is present as a kind of halo around galaxies and consists of many small particles.

Traditionally, elections in France are conducted with little technology: voters sit in a booth and place a pre-printed sheet indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.

Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes in them before the voting, and that only properly registered and eligible voters can insert envelopes into them.
Candidates may send representatives to observe all steps of the process. The votes are counted in the evening by volunteers under strict supervision, following well-defined procedures.

Besides the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo also competed in two individual events in this championship.
The first was the slalom, which in the first round was completed with a "Did Not Finish" result. Out of 116 competitors, 36 completed this race with the same result.
In another competition, the Giant Slalom, she achieved tenth place in the women's sitting group, with a total run time of 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 slower than the first-place Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 slower than the ninth-place Hungarian Dani Gyöngyi.
Four of the women skiers from the sitting group could not finish the race, and out of the 117 skiers, 45 did not place in the giant slalom.
The Madhya Pradesh police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Chief Inspector D. K. Arya stated: "We have arrested five individuals who raped the Swiss woman, and we have recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with covered faces.
Although there were three people in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed while the emergency rescuers freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
First, they were treated at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged by the Edinburgh Sheriff Court for the murder of her son.
He is in custody until the indictment and the commencement of the trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be compromised as his portrait has been widely published.
This is common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system works differently and the courts may consider the publication of photographs to be potentially prejudicial.
According to Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, "journalists are on a dangerous path if they publish photos or similar materials of suspects."
The Crown Office responsible for criminal proceedings indicated to journalists that they would no longer speak about the case before charges were filed.
According to the leaked information, the document pertains to the territorial claim that Palestine wants based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East war.
Supposedly, among the other topics discussed was the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PA is only willing to accept such a presence for five years.
In the supplementary pest control experiment, the shooters and rangers were kept under strict supervision, as the experiment was observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
The NPWS and the Australian Shooters Association (NSW) jointly recruited skilled volunteers as part of the Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the executive director of the NPWS Park Conservation and Heritage office, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have received comprehensive safety and practical training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday before a new, nine-member interim electoral council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures aimed at leading the country towards new elections.
The committee was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests starting in October.
The occasionally violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been due since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases were reported where malfunctioning iPods overheated, causing a total of six fires and injuring four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple reported 34 additional overheating cases, which the company described as "not serious."
In its response, the ministry called the postponement of Apple's announcement "sincerely regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (19:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the emergency management office of the Northern Mariana Islands, no damage has been reported in the country.
At the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, they also reported that there are no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman hijacked their bus and took Hong Kong tourists hostage in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired at the tourists with his M16 weapon.
Several hostages were rescued, but the deaths of at least six others were confirmed.
Earlier, they released six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly lady, as the lady had to go to the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While Liggins was working at the hospital, he began researching premature birth in his free time.
Her research showed that administering a hormone could accelerate the development of the baby's fetal lungs.
According to the Xinhua report, government investigators found two black boxes on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a two moon night. She was very unique, just like herself. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels remarked, "Luna was at least as eccentric as I was... maybe even more so... I love her and will miss her... I hope she is in a better place now."
Prior to the 2010 federal election, the proportion of the 1,400 people surveyed who opposed Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
The acting Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of voters share the opinion that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
According to the extreme values of the public opinion poll, 29% of respondents think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist swimmer would have competed in the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to complaints, doubts arose about their fitness.
He could not take the medications needed to overcome the pain because they are banned from games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Several people checked the discovery at the beginning of February using various hardware and software, which was then announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were the largest water carriers to Earth, along with the organic materials that form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand the formation of planets, particularly the creation of Earth, after comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a law to legalize same-sex marriages.
He labeled the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
According to some, he will run for the presidency in 2016.
The NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would enable airplanes to take shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel every year and reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to the older ground-based radar technology, to enable air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the position of aircraft and provide pilots with more precise information.
There will be no additional transport options, the trains running on the surface will not stop at Wembley, and parking and park and ride facilities will not be available.
The fears regarding the lack of transportation have raised the possibility that the game will be obligatorily held behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported the emergence of a new bird species on Ecuador's Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported the appearance of a new species, which emerged from the crossbreeding of the native medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis) and an immigrant species, the large cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris). Although it was previously believed that this process would take much longer, the new species developed in just two generations.
Gold can be shaped into any form and can be worked even into small sizes.
It can be drawn into thin, easily bendable and twistable wire. It also allows forging or rolling into sheets.
It can be formed very thin and adheres to other metals. It can be so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images of "enlightened manuscripts".
This is called chemical pH. An indicator can be made from the juice of red cabbage.
The color of the cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemical substance.
The hydrogen ions that are formed by electron donation are protons (since a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders, then press them into balls with clean, damp hands.
The moisture on our hands reacts with the outer layers, creating a strange sensation and forming a kind of crust.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of drainage systems were found in the houses of Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were also toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and sends it back to Earth almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use astronomical telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and visibility.
A giant rocket over 100 feet tall is necessary to send a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has brought incredible changes to the world. The greatest thing we can thank the wheel for is much easier and faster transportation.
This brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats, which consume medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small-sized cats (including the domestic cat) also eat much more small-sized prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the niche concept, a special activity that every cat adheres to, preventing them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called prides.
The packs consist of one to three males that are related to each other, and up to thirty females and offspring.
Females generally bond more closely with each other, being in a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides surprisingly behave very similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals that are similar in behavior to lions (but not like other big cats), and they are also very deadly to their prey.
As a balanced athlete, the tiger is capable of climbing trees (though not very well), swimming, leaping long distances, and pulling with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger (Genus Panthera) belongs to the same group as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four big cat species are the only ones whose individuals are capable of roaring.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full-power roar of a lion; it's more like a sentence composed of words that are snarled out.
Ocelots are happy to consume small animals. If they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds too. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots find them by following the scent of animals (prey), sniffing along the ground.
They can see very well in the dark because they have night vision and move stealthily. The leopard cat hunts its prey by blending into the environment and then pouncing on its victim.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originate (for example, if they cross a mountain or a river, or if they move to a new island and cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment different from the previous one.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs to have different characteristics or adapt to be a stronger competitor than it previously needed to be.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it will increasingly bear less resemblance to the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will differ so much from each other that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants are capable of producing oxygen, which people inhale, and they take in carbon dioxide, which people exhale.
Plants obtain their food from the sun through photosynthesis. In addition, they also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and we also make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is also plant-based. Without plants, animals would not survive either.
The Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing, except for another Mosasaurus.
Its long jaws are lined with more than seventy razor-sharp teeth, and there is another row on the roof of its mouth, so nothing that crosses its path can escape.
We don't know for sure, but it might have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it might even have been a cannibal.
At the same time, it attacked anything that entered the water; even a gigantic dinosaur like T. rex could not match it.
Although much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their own strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent, the edible dormouse.
The other difference was that while poor people and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, wealthy men liked to organize feasts together, where they nibbled on food while conversing next to each other.
Ancient Roman dishes could not include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and the ancient Romans never tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which they considered the home of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods and their priests, and tried to satisfy the needs of the gods with ceremonies and celebrations.
Every temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes they built special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, as part of the temples.
The top of the tower served as a special sanctuary for the deity.
Due to the warm climate of the Middle East, the house did not hold as much significance.
A significant part of Hebrew families' lives took place outdoors.
Cooking was done by women in the courtyard; the shops were only open counters facing the street. Stone was used for building the houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, therefore wood was considered an extremely precious treasure.
Greenland was sparsely populated. According to Norwegian sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was "Scandinavian," the Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, and Icelandic people, kings, customs, and histories differed in many ways.
If you have seen the movie titled National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was recorded on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is still not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776" were written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although the identity of its author is uncertain, it is known that shortly after its completion, the large parchment document (29 and a quarter inches long and 24 and a half inches wide) was stored rolled up.
So it is likely that the nomination was simply added as a label.
The Normandy landing and the subsequent battles liberated the northern part of France, but the southern part remained unfree.
This was controlled by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies occupied Southern France, and the invasion was named "Operation Dragoon."
In just under two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces liberated Southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is the unique culture that is shared among a larger group of people who live and work together in a society.
The origin of the word civilization comes from the Latin words civilis, civis, and civitas, which mean citizen, citizen of a state, and city or city-state, respectively, with the latter to some extent defining the size of the society as well.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. Civilized culture encompasses the transmission of knowledge through a few generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and equitable distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence behind, and therefore they cannot be recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the 13 states initially created a weak central government—with Congress being its sole component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, nor was there a national executive or judiciary, so it often relied on reluctant state authorities to enforce its laws.
He had no authority to override the tax laws and interstate tariffs either.
To amend the constitution, the unanimous consent of all the states was required, but the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives often stayed away from the meetings.
The Italian national football team, alongside the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, and in 2006 they won the FIFA World Cup.
Among the popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest among them being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the clustering/grouping of the islands, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical perspective.
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the name of the island - Ilha Formosa - meaning Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan, reformed the grain production methods of the indigenous people, and employed Chinese workers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the army of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took over control of the western part of Taiwan and the northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, who ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main parts: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
At the edges of the complex, most of the buildings have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work is still ongoing today.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was a defining film size at the twilight of the analog film era.
Its production is still ongoing today, but the essential thing is that its scale has been taken over by the digital camera's image sensor format.
The 35 mm format actually, somewhat confusingly, means a width of 36 mm and a height of 24 mm.
The aspect ratio of this format (after division by 12 to achieve the simplest whole number ratio) can thus be set to 3:2.
Several common formats (such as the APS format family) match or approximate this image aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, often misused and frequently the subject of ridicule, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a degree of order in an image.
He claims that the most effective place for the main subject is the intersection of the lines dividing the picture into thirds vertically and horizontally (see the example).
During this period of European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church came under scrutiny.
The Christian religion united the European states for over a thousand years, despite linguistic and customary differences.
The king’s all-encompassing power influenced everyone from the royalty to the common people.
One of the main Christian teachings is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds should specifically serve this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and seeing this concentration of power and money, many questioned whether its fundamental teachings were being fulfilled.
Not long after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, blocking vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated general international rights articulated in several international agreements from the previous two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire oceanic areas, thereby endangering even neutral ships.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to unrestricted submarine warfare as well.
During the 1920s, the prevailing behavior of citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
Having experienced the horrors and cruelties caused by World War I, the nations will avoid similar situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job in New York City at the Edison Company.
When he arrived in the United States, he had nothing but a book of poems and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his former boss).
Ancient China had a unique way of presenting different eras: every era and every ruling family in China's history was a distinctive dynasty.
A period of uncertainty between the divided provinces took place among the different dynasties. Among these periods, the most well-known was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, several nobles fighting for the throne engaged in fierce battles with each other.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, where thousands of people died fighting for the highest seat in the Xi’an palace.
The decimal system has a plethora of social and political impacts, representing a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single sovereign ruler.
After the revolution, the occupations were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to prevail.
The same applies to the military as well, because instead of the class determining the army's hierarchy, it is now based on merit.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class members in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohamed showed a deep interest in matters beyond secular life. He regularly visited a cave located on the "Noor" (light) mountain, which became known as "Hira" as a place of meditation.
He himself is the cave that has weathered the ages and gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca is completely isolated from the outside world.
What's more, it is not easy to find even if one knows of its existence. Once we enter the cave, the isolation is complete.
Nothing else can be seen, only the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains. This world is scarcely visible or audible from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of many large pyramids that were constructed in honor of deceased pharaohs.
On the Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis," in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, there are several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), as well as many small tombs, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, while several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "pull upwards" sign is V-shaped, while the "pull downwards" sign resembles a staple or a square missing its bottom side.
The upwards means you have to start at the mountain and press the bow, the downwards means you have to start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Pulling "up" usually produces a softer sound, while pulling "down" is stronger and more pronounced.
Feel free to mark your comments with a pencil, just remember that the printed bow markings are there for musical reasons, so they generally need to be respected.
The terrified Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women on October 6, 1789.
They traveled back to Paris in a car, surrounded by a mob shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to fully open the windows of their carriage.
Suddenly, before the terrified eyes of the queen, a member of the crowd was shaking the head of a member of the royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The US imperialism's war expenditures for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
In order to cover a large part of the costs, they had to pay taxes to the American colonial rule, and the bonds drifted to Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Naturally, the superprofits originated from the protracted exploitation of the Filipino people, constituting the fundamental gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the circumstances that led to the creation of the order.
The period of events is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000 - 1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism, in practice, encompasses a wide range of ideas, with the advocacy of technology or technological imperative strictly suggesting that human destiny is governed by the underlying logic of scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself largely follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that on the other hand, technology has "effects" on societies, which are intrinsic rather than socially conditioned.
For example, there is also an opinion that vehicles necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable with few cars, so new manufacturing methods have been developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
At the same time, mass car ownership also leads to high numbers of road accidents, which encourages the invention of new techniques in healthcare aimed at healing injured bodies.
A significant part of Romanticism was composed of cultural determinism, drawing from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture tied to a specific geographical location developed, which, being in harmony with the community's place, proved to be better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as the epicenter of luxury began around A.D. 400 and lasted until about A.D. 1100.
Its situation deteriorated in the 12th century, primarily because the crusader knights rejected suspicious gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more highly than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
During this time, Paris won the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
The Gothic style's peak period lasted from the 10th-11th century to the 14th century.
The clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine, Eastern culture in the beginning.
However, due to the slow communication methods, styles might have lagged 25-30 years behind in the west.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments as a result of the Crusades was that people began to fasten their clothes using buttons.
Subsistence farming is agriculture conducted to produce only enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that uses preserved seeds widespread in the ecoregion and crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Throughout history, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries today.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms and allow the development of self-esteem in them.
Subcultures can be characterized by the age, ethnicity, social class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics defining a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical differences, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership with a recognizable system of symbols style, which includes fashion, behavior patterns, and the use of slang.
One of the most frequently used methods aimed at demonstrating the importance of socialization is to draw attention to the examples of those few unfortunate children who, due to negligence, misfortune, or premeditated abuse, could not be socialized in an adult environment during their maturation into adulthood.
We call such children wild or unmanageable. Some wild children were separated from people (often their own parents), sometimes the abandonment of the child was due to parental rejection because of the child's severe intellectual or physical impairment.
The feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Allegedly, some were raised among animals; it is said that some lived alone in the wild.
If they are raised entirely by non-human animals, in the wild, a child living within physical constraints almost entirely adopts the behavioral patterns of the animals caring for them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step beyond this.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, rather it is assistance that provides support to those who are participating in a new learning experience, such as learning to use new software or embarking on a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a kind of "scaffold" as well, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolds were integrated into the software, with the aim of interrogating, insightfully questioning, and explaining those procedures that would have challenged the student when completing the task independently.
Children are placed in orphanages for various reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to even extortion.
A child should never be allowed to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, yet it still happens.
We consider foster care to be a safe zone for these children.
Our goal in foster care is a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and a reliable healthcare system.
Orphanages must provide for all the needs that are missing from the previous home from which they were taken.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the internet lead to further opportunities from the perspective of the uses and gratifications model.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"The \"personal involvement\" and \"continuing relationships\" were also considered new motivational factors in the study by Eighmey and McCord (1998), which focused on the audience's reactions to internet sites."
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
Especially if they claim that some people can correctly determine from certain facial expressions if someone is lying.
In his essay on the presidential speech (The President's Speech), Oliver Sacks pointed out that people who have suffered brain damage and are unable to interpret speech can very accurately perceive sincerity.
He also claims that the ability to interpret human behavior can be found in animals, such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two variations of genetic diversity: hidden and expressed.
The mutation offers an opportunity for new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the set of expressed variations.
Mixing of segregation and recombination, the forward-backward variation between the two funds in every generation.
Out on the savanna, it is difficult for primates with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet their amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Moreover, there are serious consequences if this is not met: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, foods of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide a large amount of protein containing all essential amino acids.
Taking everything into account, it would not be surprising if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a similar way to how today's chimpanzees do on the savannah.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of intentionally waking up from a regular sleep cycle and falling back asleep within a short period (10-60 minutes).
This can be done quite easily with a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring about a state of alertness without fully waking you up.
If you reset the clock in your sleep, place it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed and turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to consume a lot of fluids (especially water and tea, which is a well-known diuretic) before sleep, which forces a person to urinate at night.
The degree of inner peace possessed by a person is in contrast with the degree of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Every person has the opportunity to find perfect peace and contentment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. Only our own tension and negativity can prevent us from achieving this goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is built on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded with the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga origin.
In theory, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of the path of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and all-encompassing love.
With the help of Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
At the center of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through the visualization of numerous deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated, and consciousness is enlightened.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the USA. At the end of the war, as a result of differences in systems, methods, and cultures, the countries came into conflict.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
For the next 40 years, proxy armies clashed in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other locations.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already broken, and the only hope was retreating and reorganizing through the Romanian bridgehead.
At the same time, these plans were declared obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after overrunning the eastern part of Poland, thus violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international bilateral and multilateral agreements.
The use of cargo ships is by far the most efficient method to transport a large number of people and a significant amount of goods across the oceans.
The work of navies has traditionally been to ensure that the country is able to move people and goods while hindering the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most memorable and recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to cross the Atlantic Ocean with people and raw materials to help the British.
At the same time, the German navy attempted, primarily with submarines, to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany likely would have been able to conquer Britain as it did with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them for the easily accessible source of milk, as well as for their fur, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were traditionally kept in herds that roamed on hills or other pastures under the supervision of child or adolescent goatherds, similar to the more widely known shepherds. These grazing methods are still used today.
Tracks were already being built in England in the 16th century.
Although the tracks consisted only of planks laid parallel to each other, they allowed horses to pull loads faster and heavier on them than on the relatively few bumpy roads of the era.
The connecting elements were used quite quickly to keep the track in place. At the same time, they slowly realized that it would be more efficient if they placed a piece of iron on it.
This became a daily practice, but the iron put more strain on the wooden wheels of the wagon.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first completely iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transportation was walking. Humans began walking on two legs two million years ago, coinciding with the appearance of Homo Erectus (upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not habitually walk upright.
Bipedal speciation is found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as far back as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more eco-friendly way, join the environmental movement, and even become activists to somewhat reduce the suffering of the future.
This is often like symptomatic treatment. However, if we want more than just a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and eliminate it.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, and problems have become bigger due to overpopulation and the luxurious lifestyle of humanity.
After its introduction on July 4 at Congress, the handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary of State Charles Thomson was sent to the printing press of John Dunlap, located a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are today referred to as "Dunlap broadsides."
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. The copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap sides, which are still considered today, are regarded as the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived, namely the birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they are feathered and capable of flying.
The birds still look similar to the dinosaurs in many ways.
They have scaly and clawed feet, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs, like a T-Rex.
Practically every computer in use today operates based on the handling of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one value out of two, 0 or 1, which are called binary digits or bits in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning is not necessarily immediately apparent. Symptoms like vomiting are too general to establish an immediate diagnosis.
The surest sign of internal poisoning may be an open container of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions specific to the poison.
Entomologists use the term bug in the official sense for this group of insects.
The term originates from the ancient knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects excellently adapted to parasitize humans.
The robber bugs and bed bugs are also nest builders, meaning they are suitable for nest making or they use the host organism.
In the United States, approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known, making it the leading neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple might decide that it is not in their interest or their child's interest to raise a baby.
These couples may decide to create an adoption plan for their baby.
At adoption, biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to determine how the world works using scientific methods. This method is essentially the foundation of most scientific research.
However, this does not consist solely of this. Experimentation, and an experiment is a test that serves to exclude one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions and to observe, which also aid scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, with particular attention to the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in every field of science, including psychology.
With the decline of the knowledge of Greek, the West cut itself off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
In most cases, the rhythms detectable in the field of physiology and human behavior largely depend on the occurrence of endogenous cycles and their production during the biological cycle.
Periodic rhythms can be observed in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, which are not merely reactions to external periodic signals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that continues free-running cycles even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence for the theory that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were conducted in which the phage DNA was labeled with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects depending on the nature of the mutation, the significance of the genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be inherited by children, while mutations occurring elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in natural sites and enjoy the scenery, including the plant and animal life.
The on-site programs include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits, and studying information related to the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about Bornean orangutans.
Every morning people drive from rural small towns to go to their workplaces, passing by those whose job location is the place they have recently left.
In this dynamic commuting network, everyone is somehow connected to everyone else, supporting a transportation system based on the use of private cars.
Science suggests that this massive carbon dioxide emission has disrupted the biosphere from its stable state, which supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone has complaints about them.
In developed countries, one rarely hears similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do the shipping systems give rise to such complaints, why do they fail daily? Are the logistics engineers simply incompetent? Or is there some fundamental flaw?
The flow of traffic is the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally tend to behave within a reasonable range; thus, traffic processes usually have reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically to a reasonable extent.
To better illustrate the flow of traffic, a correlation was found among the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections help in the planning, design, and operation of roadside facilities.
The insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid predators more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantageous trait of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
This offers them more places to hide from predators.
Today only dragonflies and mayflies cannot fold their hind wings.
Millennia ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moves around the Sun.
Some believed he was right, but many thought the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems reasonable because you don't feel the Earth spinning, do you?
The Amazon is the largest and second longest river on Earth. Its discharge is more than eight times that of the river with the second largest discharge.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, spanning up to 6 miles in certain places.
20 percent of the river water flowing into the oceans originates from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, they never surpassed the size and structural excellence of the Pyramids of Giza.
Ancient Egyptians living during the New Kingdom were fascinated by the monuments built by their predecessors, which by then were well over a millennium old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, both in size and population.
The Vatican uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is the everyday language used by the majority of state employees, while Latin is mostly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People as early as ancient times knew basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper, as each of these can be found in nature in raw form and can be relatively easily mined with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, thought that everything was composed of a mixture of one or more members of the four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more about the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he thought that they would become new materials visible to us.
The alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more types of metals. It should be noted that there are many chemical elements in the periodic table.
Calcium, potassium, and similar elements are considered metals. Naturally, there are other metals as well, such as silver and gold.
Some alloys may contain non-metallic elements in small quantities, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter. Every piece of matter is built from tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions could fit in the period at the end of the sentence.
Thus, the pencil was of good service to many people upon its appearance.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods have developed, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and is used less frequently.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens and never come near a sharpener.
We can only guess what the keyboard will be like if they come up with some newer development.
The fissile bomb operates on the principle that colliding the atomic nucleus with many protons and neutrons requires energy.
It is as if we are pushing a heavy cart uphill. The fission of the atomic nucleus releases a portion of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that sometimes they split apart due to slight influences or spontaneously.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
The crust is thinner under the mare regions and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there is more black rock in its nearby area because the crust is thinner. It is easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on what drives people or what piques their interest.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized during the process of growing up.
These theories examine what makes certain people want to do the things they do, and what in their environment prompts them to do those things or not.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, it can be said that two behaviors can develop when leaders start to manage their former peers. One end of the spectrum is when they try to "remain one of the guys" (or gals).
For such a leader, it is difficult to make unpopular decisions, conduct disciplinary procedures, perform performance evaluations, define areas of responsibility, and hold people accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, someone transforms into an unrecognizable person who feels that everything created by the group must be changed and made their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for their team's success or failure.
This behavior often creates conflict between the leaders and the rest of the group.
The performance indicators of virtual teams are measured by the same standards as those of traditional teams, but there are some slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as liaisons for the immediate physical group.
They often have more independence than traditional team members because their teams can meet across different time zones, which local management may not necessarily understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique characteristic of the virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the leadership team to whom the members report. The invisible team sets the standard for the members.
Why would an organization go through the time-consuming process of becoming a learning organization? One of the aims of implementing learning concepts in organizations is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process of cooperation in overcoming barriers within the organization leads to an innovative process that serves to meet the needs of customers.
Before an organization becomes innovative, the leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum principle as a method that can help organizations achieve greater performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the study of cognition, therefore narrowing the research field and making it much more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior supports the observations of scientists.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, wounds, and tumors can affect behavior and also induce changes in certain mental abilities.
The rise of new technologies allows for the observation of brain structures and processes never before seen.
This provides us with a wealth of information and materials, with the help of which we can build simulation models to understand what processes are taking place in our minds.
Despite the fact that AI has a strong science fiction connotation, it is actually a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
The research of artificial intelligence includes the creation of machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
For example, control, planning and scheduling, response capability to customer diagnoses and queries, as well as handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
Such matters have developed into independent fields of science, focusing on solving real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now frequently used in economic, medical, technical, and military fields, as well as being integrated into the software of many home computers and video games.
Class trips are a significant part of every classroom. Teachers often and gladly take their students to places where bus trips are not possible.
Technology enables virtual excursions. Students can view museum artworks, visit an aquarium, or admire any kind of artistic creation while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing the experience of a class trip with others virtually is also a great way to reminisce about the trip and to share experiences with future classes.
For example, the students of Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their visit to the state capital, and although the website is redesigned every year, the old versions are kept as a yearbook in an online accessible form.
Blogs can also assist in improving students' writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the appearance of an audience usually changes this.
Since the most critical audience often comes from the ranks of the students, the blogger considers the development of writing skills to be of key importance to avoid criticism.
At the same time, blogging "forces students to better understand the world around them." Keeping the audience's interest encourages students to be witty and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to significantly extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs "can prepare students to become more analytical and critical; actively responding to online materials can help students define their stance towards others' writings" and their own perspectives on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the enchanting, bilingual capital of Canada, showcasing numerous art exhibits and museums that present the past and present of Canada.
Further south is Niagara Falls, while to the north lies the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka.
These, along with many other things, portray Ontario in an unadulterated Canadian light in the eyes of foreigners.
Northward, there are vast, sparsely populated areas and sometimes almost completely uninhabited wilderness.
A population fact that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean near the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest land area, and in itself could be considered a continent regarding wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are associated with France, and they are famous as coastal luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the regions, and it gained significant ground in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The northern part of the region is bordered by the Sahel, and the western and southern parts are bordered by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that female travelers say they are married regardless of their marital status.
It's useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks very expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can result in something they may interpret as harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences aside, it is still not acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used as a strategic port under the name Anfa by the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the Marinids.
The Portuguese demolished it, then rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it in 1755 due to an earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city under the name Daru l-Badya, and the Spanish traders named it Casablanca and established their trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco for shopping.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and all kinds of trinkets, but everything here is aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, one should inquire about the situation of ongoing fighting in North Kivu province before visiting areas outside of Goma.
The city is the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, and it is also one of the cheapest places in Africa for mountain gorilla watching.
For transportation within Gomán, boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) can be used. The usual fare for a shorter trip is around 500 Congolese francs.
Coupled with its relative isolation, "Timbuktu" is also used as a metaphor to describe exotic, remote places.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although due to its reputation, it is a tourist attraction and also has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to the encroaching desert sands.
This was one of the main stops in Henry Louis Gates' PBS series "Wonders of the African World."
The city is in stark contrast to the other cities in the country, as it exudes more of an Arab vibe than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, and it is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each home to a distinct wildlife.
This constitutes one of South Africa's main attractions, and is considered the flagship of the national parks of the Republic of South Africa.
As in all South African national parks, here too you have to pay a conservation and entry daily fee.
"It can also be useful to purchase a 'Wild Card', which allows you entry to either selected South African parks or all South African national parks."
The name of Hong Kong comes from Hong Kong Island, and this place is the focus of attention for many tourists.
The parade of buildings forming Hong Kong's skyline resembles a glittering bar chart, further accentuated by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
The urban part of Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated largely on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that the English colonizers occupied, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove region, extending 80 km inland from the coast into the hinterlands of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans became a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest located in India is known as Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests do not consist solely of mangrove swamps—here also lie some of the last strongholds of the vast jungle that once covered the entire Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which about one-third is covered by water/swampy areas.
The Sundarbans region has served as a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart all day from the inter-district bus station (across the river), but most of them, especially those heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses often fill up, it is recommended to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
In most districts, small Japanese party buses operate, which are comfortable and have high load capacity.
The shared taxi is a fast and convenient solution for visiting nearby places - such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the city of Oiapoque in Brazil with the city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two traffic lanes that are 3.5 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was only opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, by which time the completion of the Brazilian customs points is anticipated.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group living as semi-nomadic hunters in what is today Eastern Paraguay, and they also maintained subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to groups of other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua tribes, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay in the 16th century, previously known as "The Great Province of the Indians," was established as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish initiated the colonization phase, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain significant parts of its indigenous traits and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the world's best water polo teams and players.
The biggest competition series of the year will be in December at the Las Cañitas polo field.
During other times of the year, less prestigious competitions and matches can also be viewed here.
For news related to the championships and for purchasing tickets to the polo matches, visit the website of the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to the British pound (GBP).
Currency exchange is only possible at the island's sole bank, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West shop.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere on the islands and surrounding areas, and it is often possible to pay with a Stanley bank card or US dollars as well.
On the more remote islands, credit cards are likely not accepted, though they might still take British and American currency. It's worth checking in advance with the owner to see what payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity together make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly rainy and dry seasons: the amount of rain is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to encountering people, wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authority, keep a distance of at least 100 meters from bears and wolves, and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not maintain the proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so you must leave them their space to move.
Additionally, it is important to know that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so make sure not to cook or bring strongly scented foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu, and its population is slightly under 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1850 and became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships sank except for a single British battleship. About 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was killed at a peaceful gathering in the town.
There are many beaches as Auckland is enclosed by two harbors. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of the northern shore (in the North Harbour district) are located along the Pacific Ocean and stretch from the northern Long Bay all the way to the southern Devonport.
It is safe to swim at almost all sandy beaches, and most provide shade from the pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located at the Waitemata Harbour, in the expensive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the central part of Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches lined with various shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One'. It is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can find plenty of French wine, but New Zealand and Australian wines better withstand the journey.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're concerned, bottled water is easily available.
For Australians, the concept of 'flat white' coffee is unfamiliar. The short black is called 'espresso', lots of cream (not foam) is piled on the cappuccino, and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian expectations. The fruit juices are expensive but of excellent quality.
Throughout the year, many visitors arrive at the reef, and injuries resulting from this rarely occur.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, adhere to the instructions on the signs, and pay close attention to the safety warnings.
Since 1770, box jellyfish have been present near beaches and river mouths between October and April. Occasionally, they can also be found elsewhere during these times.
Sharks can be found, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and prefer to move away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the ocean; their primary habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advanced booking provides the traveler with the peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have special deals with certain hotels, although it is possible to book other types of accommodation through a travel agent as well, such as camping.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and accommodation packages.
They might even hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents needed for the destination (such as a visa).
Please send any modifications or requests to the travel agent first, not directly to the hotel.
At certain music festivals, the vast majority of participants choose to camp on-site; moreover, most consider this an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to arrive early to get a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even though the concert on the main stage has ended, there may be areas of the festival where music continues late into the night.
Some festivals have separate camping areas for families with small children.
If you sail across the northern Baltic Sea in winter, pay attention to the location of the cabin, as navigating through the ice can be terribly noisy for those who are too close.
Part of the city tour are the St. Petersburg round trips. The passengers of the ships are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos usually make numerous efforts to maximize the time guests spend and the money they spend. Windows and clocks are generally absent, and exits are difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drink, and entertainment offers to keep guests in a good mood and keep them in the venue.
In certain places, alcoholic drinks are also offered on the house. At the same time, drunkenness impairs one's judgment, and every good gambler knows how important it is to remain sober.
Any driver at high altitudes or mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low, and you cannot drive on them like on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short time to cause disruptions.
The visibility can also be limited by snowfall or snowdrift, condensation, or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic is uninterrupted throughout the year.
African safaris are perhaps the most attractive tourist attractions and provide an outstanding experience for visitors.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to land journeys aimed at viewing the impressive wildlife of the African wilderness, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, like giraffes and elephants, venture close to the cars, so they can be observed well even with average equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
The walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "trekking safari," or "footing") consists of a few hours or several days of hiking.
The Paralympics will be held between August 24 and September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having been the host for the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you might find yourself in a strange situation.
The cancellation conditions vary, but since the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
According to expectations, event tickets will generally cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with ticket prices typically around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes helps with drying. In several hotels, you can find an iron and ironing board, which you can use even if there isn't one in your room.
If there is no iron, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if you have one.
Caution, do not allow the fabric to overheat (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are several ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling the water for one minute is sufficient, while elsewhere more time is needed for this.
The effectiveness of the filters is variable, and if you are concerned, consider buying water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pest animals that they might not have come across at home before.
Pests can ruin food, cause irritation or, in worse cases, allergic reactions, as well as spread poison or infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people, are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping means the tax- and duty-free purchase of products at certain locations.
Travelers to countries with heavy taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, particularly on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the biggest challenge in terms of driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often passes through remote, isolated areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep your eyes open: the road is characterized by steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp bends.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the preceding and following sections — generally 35–40 mph (56–64 km/h) — and strict adherence to them is of utmost importance.
It is interesting, however, that the signal strength is much stronger here than in other parts of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds area.
German bakery products are very good; in Bavaria, they are made quite richly and variably, similar to their southern neighbors, Austria.
Fruit cakes are common: apples are typically baked into pastries year-round, while cherries and plums are used in summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The more popular pastries are often well paired with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but hearty pastries, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
The curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, prepared with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "saucy" depending on how much liquid it contains.
In Northern India and inland Pakistan, yogurt is often used to make curry, while in Southern India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is generally used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a comprehensive term that covers the vast range of regional kitchens found in the country.
However, when used without other qualifications, the term mostly refers to dishes originating from the central and eastern parts of Java's main island.
Javanese cuisine, widely present throughout the entire archipelago, offers various simply seasoned dishes in which the flavors of Java are dominated by peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups hanging down on either side of the saddle support the rider's feet.
They provide greater stability for the rider, however, their use raises safety concerns, as the rider's foot may get caught.
If the horse throws the rider but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, the horse may drag them along if it continues to gallop. To minimize this risk, we can take several safety precautions.
First of all, most competitors wear riding boots with heels, smooth, narrow soles.
Afterwards, some saddles, particularly English saddles, are equipped with safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to fall from the saddle if the rider pulls back while falling.
The Cochamó Valley is a prominent climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with various large granite walls and crevices.
From the peaks of the mountaintops, a breathtaking view opens up. Mountaineers from all over the world constantly create new routes on the walls that offer endless possibilities.
The downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports, involving descending snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with a significant fan base, whose enthusiasts are sometimes called "lovers of skiing," and entire vacations are planned around skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave drawings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.!
The origin of skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backpack skiing: also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It is associated with, but usually does not involve an alpine-style ski tour or mountaineering, the latter happen on steep terrain and with much tighter skis and boots.
Interpret the ski route as if it were a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, one can travel a greater distance than by walking—but rarely can they reach the speed necessary for cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on maintained trails.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling across several countries would mean going through visa applications and passport controls multiple times.
However, in this regard, the Schengen Area operates somewhat like a single country.
As long as you stay in this zone, it is generally not necessary to go through additional passport control points when crossing borders.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to obtain a separate visa for each Schengen member state, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universally defined rule for which produced items are considered antiques. According to the definition of some tax offices, antiques are items over 100 years old.
The definition varies by geographical location; in some places, this age limit is shorter than in Europe, such as in North America.
We could define handmade products as antique items, although they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer husbandry has been an important source of livelihood for the Sámi people - and still is today - and the culture surrounding the industry is important to many people engaged in other occupations.
Even traditionally, not all Sámi participated in large-scale reindeer herding; instead, they lived from fishing, hunting, and similar activities, mostly using the reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sámi region's city of Sápmi.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you wish to visit is the subject of a travel warning, it may affect travel health insurance or insurance related to trip cancellation.
Furthermore, they may seek the advice of other governments, but these governments have tailored their advice to their own citizens.
As an example, Middle Eastern American citizens may receive different treatment from Europeans and Arabs.
The briefings are merely short summaries of a country's political situation.
The views presented are often brief, general, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is a collective term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social disruptions, or even loss of lives.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are several types depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
The strong wind, hail, excessive precipitation, and wildfires are forms of appearance and consequences of extreme weather, along with thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
The regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena include blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
We strongly advise travelers to inform themselves about the severe weather risks affecting the area, as these may impact their travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country classified as a war zone would benefit from undergoing professional training beforehand.
If we search the words 'Hostile Environment Course' on the internet, we will probably get the address of a local company.
The course generally covers all the issues discussed here in much greater detail, in most cases combined with practical experience.
A course usually lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training as well.
Books and magazines themed around wilderness survival are common, whereas publications about war zones are rare.
Passengers who are planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documents for the return journey.
The attitude of individual governments differs in whether they are willing to issue a passport where the gender is not marked (X), or to issue a document containing the new name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents is just as variable.
The screenings conducted at security checkpoints became much more intrusive in the period following September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals awaiting surgery cannot expect their privacy and dignity to remain intact when passing through a body scanner.
The returning currents are the backward flows of waves breaking away from the shore, often at a reef or something similar.
The effect of the underwater topology compresses the returning current in some deeper sections, and a swift flow may develop there in the deep water.
Most deaths occur due to fatigue when they try to swim against the current, which is nearly impossible.
As soon as you get out of the flow, swimming back to the shore becomes no harder than normally.
Try to aim for a place where the current won't carry you away again, or - depending on your abilities and whether you've been noticed - it might be worth waiting for the rescue.
Reverse cultural shock occurs much sooner than cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can also be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapted to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their own original culture.
Upon returning home after spending time abroad, you adapt to the new culture and abandon some habits from your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding with you, and they were aware that travelers visiting an unfamiliar country need to adapt.
People probably don't think that returning travelers need patience and understanding.
The sound and light show of the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions in the area for children.
We can see the pyramids in the dark and quiet even before the show begins.
Usually, you can always hear the voices of tourists and vendors here. The story told by sound and light is just like a storybook.
The sphinx provides the background and is the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by numerous countries and this area has the most bases, of which sixteen were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others, this includes Livingston Island and Deception Island, the latter of which features a submerged caldera of an active volcano that forms a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is an area bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea, located south of the peninsula.
The mountains of the peninsula merge with the plateau, then emerge again, forming the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part or the Sentinel Range lies Antarctica's highest mountain mass, the Vinson Massif, culminating at Mount Vinson, with a height of 4,892 meters.
In remote places where there is no mobile signal, a satellite phone may be the only solution.
A satellite phone generally does not replace mobile phones because you need to be outdoors with an unobstructed view of the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used in shipping, including recreational boating, as well as those expeditions where data and voice telecommunications are required.
The local telephone service provider can give you more information about connecting to the service.
An increasingly popular option is taking a so-called gap year for travel and study.
This is particularly popular among graduates, allowing them to take a year off before university without jeopardizing their studies.
In many cases, a course completed abroad during the gap year can actually increase the chances of being admitted to higher education upon returning to one's home country.
Participation in these educational programs is usually subject to tuition fees.
Finland is a great boating destination. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of small islands in the area of the lakes and the coastal archipelago.
In the archipelago and on the lakes, a yacht is not necessarily required.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are big enough for yachting, with smaller boats or even kayaks, we can also have a different kind of experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, and every seventh or eighth person owns a boat.
This is also the case for Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands this ratio is one to forty).
Most featured Baltic Sea cruises offer a long stop in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that for a couple of days, you can visit the historic city while spending the night on the ship.
Since 2009, if you only disembark with boat excursions, you do not need a separate visa.
In the brochures of some cruises, Berlin, Germany is also included in the offerings. As can be seen on the map above, Berlin is not at all near the sea, and visiting the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be terrifying for individuals of any age and background, especially if they have never flown before or have gone through a traumatic experience.
There’s no need to be ashamed of it: it’s just like personal fears, or like when we don’t like something - many people feel this way.
For some individuals, a partial understanding of the operation of aircraft and events occurring during flight may help in overcoming the fear that is rooted in a lack of knowledge or control.
Courier companies pay well for fast delivery. Time is crucial for business documents, goods, or urgent repairs in the case of parts.
Some routes have airplanes owned by larger companies, but on other routes and with smaller companies, there have been problems.
If items are sent by air freight, on some routes it may have happened that days passed before the goods were unloaded and cleared customs.
For faster transit, we checked it in as luggage. The airline's rules do not allow sending a package without a passenger, this is where you come into the picture.
Flying first class or business class is a straightforward way if you fork out a thick wad of cash for the privilege (or better yet, get your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: you can generally expect to pay four times the usual fare in business class and eleven times in first class!
Generally speaking, it makes no sense to look for discounts on business or first-class seats between points A and B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay large amounts for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, so they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a republic made up of multiple nationalities, suffering from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the unilateral declaration of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in Eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency; however, no UN member country recognizes the state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of Moldova were restored.
In Moldova, Eastern Orthodoxy is the main religion.
With a population of about 3.7 million, Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
The former city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, located in a large, mountain-surrounded bay.
Wide boulevards, glass-walled buildings, and modern shopping centers are interspersed with traditional red tile roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than a traditional Turkish one.
The village of Haldarsvík offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, marble statues depicting interesting doves can be seen over some graves.
It is worth taking a half-hour walk in the captivating little village.
To the north, easily accessible, lies Sintra, the romantic and fascinating city that became famous among foreigners after Lord Byron's notes on its splendors.
The Scotturb bus number 403 frequently departs for Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, also visit the Great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, which is a site of a Marian apparition famous worldwide.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave site that holds almost immeasurable value for a portion of the world's population.
There are still numerous men and women who have survived their time there, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death there, whether they were Jewish or not.
Please treat the place with the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not distort the site by drawing graffiti or scratching structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, the majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the nominations are only in Catalan, because according to the law, it is the first official language.
Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the subway are only heard in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions can be heard through an automated system in several languages, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The Parisians are known as egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
While this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to succeed in Paris is still to behave our best: like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will significantly ease our way.
The Parisians' raw behavior quickly disappears if a few basic courtesy formulas are observed.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is a very wooded area, mostly comprising beech trees, spruces, conifers, and a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a particularly diverse range of plant communities, thanks to the microclimate range, the different soil types, and the various altitude levels.
The area also provides a home to a remarkably diverse range of animal and bird species.
A rare wildlife can be found here, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie, as well as many other more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover the knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide scarves for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially a brightly colored one, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Following the same principle, men must wear trousers that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the supply at the entrance, but the clothing is not washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
The cuisine of Mallorca, similar to other Mediterranean regions, primarily uses bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and olive oil for everything.
A simple popular dinner, especially in the summertime, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and available seasonings, be it cheese, tuna, or anything else.
All nouns, alongside the word Sie (you), always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish certain verbs and their objects.
They claim that it makes reading easier, although writing becomes somewhat more complicated because it is necessary to figure out whether a verb or adjective is used in its nominalized form.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively easy because most words have to be pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation depends on the following vowel.
Additionally, attention should be paid to the different pronunciation of r and rr: caro means expensive, while carro means cart.
Persian grammar is relatively easy and mostly regular.
Therefore, by reading this grammar primer, we can learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand the expressions.
It goes without saying that anyone who knows a Romance language can learn Portuguese more easily.
Nevertheless, those people who know a little Spanish hastily conclude that the Portuguese language is close enough that it does not need to be learned separately.
Observatories from before modernization have become outdated today and are turning into museums or educational sites.
In their heyday, light pollution was not such a significant problem, so they are mostly found in cities or university areas, in more easily accessible locations than their modern counterparts.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous devices located in isolated areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Watching the cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originates from China, where plum blossoms were the most popular flowers.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing parties were held by the ruler for himself and the aristocratic members of the imperial court.
Plants are the most beautiful in their natural habitat, so resist the temptation to remove “just one” specimen.
If you are caught "collecting samples" in an ornately arranged garden, you will be thrown out without argument.
Singapore is generally a particularly safe place where it is easy to navigate, and almost everything can be obtained after arrival.
However, since the area slightly north of the equator belongs to the "very hot zone," one must account for the heat (always) and the intense sunshine (when the sky is clear, less frequently).
There are some buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs - Abraham, Isaac, Jacob - and their wives.
Check if the bus you want to travel with actually goes into Hebron and not just to the nearby Kiryat Arba Jewish settlement.
Inland waterways could be a good theme on which to base our vacation.
For example, a visit to the castles of the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, or a cruise along the Danube touching on the more interesting cities, or perhaps boating along the Erie Canal.
Furthermore, they also define popular hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, when the birth of Jesus is celebrated.
Many traditions related to the holiday have been adopted by the non-religious members of Christian countries as well as by non-Christian countries.
There is a tradition where Easter night is spent awake in some open place to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition as well, but it is likely that it is a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
The more traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Holy Saturday night, and the congregations often break out in celebration at midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands got here by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, so the giant tortoise became the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the arrival of humans, numerous mammals have been introduced to the Galapagos Islands, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in the winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to view the northern lights, as the sky will be dark nearly all day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution rarely causes problems, you can also enjoy stargazing.
The Japanese work culture is more formal and hierarchical than what Westerners might be accustomed to.
A suit is standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their last names or job titles.
Workplace harmony plays a crucial role, therefore it is important to focus on group efforts rather than highlighting individual achievements.
Employees must seek approval from their superiors before making any decisions, and they are also expected to carry out their superiors' instructions without question.
