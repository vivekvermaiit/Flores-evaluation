This does not confirm only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already well established, but it also offers details that fossils usually cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on top with a lighter underside or with carotenoid pigments.
The study also offers information regarding the evolution of plumage in birds.
Since the feathers of the dinosaurs did not have a well-developed central shaft, called rachis, but have other characteristics of feathers (hooks and barbules), researchers have deduced that the rachis most likely developed later in the evolution of these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but to regulate temperature or for display. The researchers have suggested that, even though the tail belongs to a young dinosaur, the specimen shows the plumage of an adult and not the down of a young bird.
The researchers have suggested that, even if the tail is of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxies.
The effect that the team was looking for might have been caused by the tidal forces within the dark matter of the galaxy and that of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth, thus determining the tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter has an effect on other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory claims that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in the form of a halo and is made of many small particles.

"Their thermal behavior is not consistent like on the bigger craters on Earth, which maintain a more or less constant temperature, but it is compatible with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground," declared Glen Cushing from the astrogeological team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and from the Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France voting is traditionally a technology-based experience: voters isolate themselves inside a booth and put the pre-printed paper with the marked candidate they have chosen into an envelope.
Once the officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope into the ballot box for counting and signs the electoral list.
The French electoral law codifies the procedure in a very precise way.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes for the counting must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes slipped into the opening of the ballot and that no envelopes are added, doing the same for those of the voters counted and authorized in an appropriate manner.
The candidates can send representatives to attend every phase of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to very precise procedures.

According to the law, violent video games sold in the state of California must have a label with "18" written on it, and their sale to minors can be penalized with a fine of 1000 dollars per offense.
Director of Public Prosecutions, lawyer Kier Starmer, made a statement this morning announcing the judicial proceedings against Huhne and Pryce.
Hunhe resigned and will be replaced by Deputy Ed Davey in the government. In Davey's place, at the Ministry of Labor, will be Deputy Norman Lamb.
Huhne and Pryce would have to appear before the Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16.
The victims were Nicholas Alden (25 years old) and Zachary Cuddeback (21 years old). Cuddeback was at his position off duty.
Edgar Veguilla injured an arm and the jaw, and Kristoffe Schneider needed reconstructive surgery on his face.
Uka's arm froze when it was aimed at the head of a certain man. Schneider suffers from chronic pain, dizziness in one eye, no longer has a piece of skull, and has a face reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via a video from a distance while located at a USAF base in his homeland.
Regarding the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo also took part in two individual races in the Championships.
Her first race was the slalom, which she did not finish on the first run. 36 of the 116 competitors had the same result in that race.
In other competitions, the giant slalom, she came tenth among the seated skiers with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first arrival, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth, the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four skiers from the seated skiers group did not finish the race, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the giant slalom did not place in the rankings.
The police of Madhya Pradesh have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The deputy inspector general D K Arya announced: "We have arrested five people who assaulted the Swiss woman and recovered her cellphone and her laptop."
The suspects have been identified as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Superintendent of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki announced that the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
English sentence: Even though there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were hurt.
The driver, however, was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed while emergency services were extracting the driver from his red Audi TT.
Initially he was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya at that time finds herself in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court, accused of having killed her son.
She is in custody awaiting the charge and the trial, but the testimonies of the eyewitnesses may be falsified, since her photograph has been published almost everywhere.
This practice is common throughout the rest of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish judicial system operates differently, and therefore after the court, the publication of photographs is potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee has pointed out that "the journalists really seem to want to cross a dangerous line by publishing photographs and other things of the suspects."
The Public Prosecutor's Office, which is responsible for judicial processes, has declared to the journalists that it will not make further comments at least until an indictment is made.
According to the news sources, the document will concern the issue of borders that Palestine wants to be based on the borders that existed before the Middle East War of 1967.
It has been reported that other topics covered concern the future status of Jerusalem, sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requests a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, whereas Palestine approves a presence of only five years.
The shooters in the integrated control experiment for invasive species had to be closely monitored by forest guards, while the experiment was evaluated and its effectiveness assessed.
In cooperation between the NPWS and the Australian Sporting Shooters Association (NSW Inc), qualified volunteers have been selected within the framework of the association's shooters' hunting program.
According to Mick O’Flynn, the deputy director of conservation and heritage of NPWS parks, the four shooters selected for the initial hunting operation were trained and have completed full safety protocol training.
Yesterday, Martelly established a new provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
He is Martelly's CEP account in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the CEP chief as part of a package of measures to bring the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the large protests against the regime that started in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were caused by the lack of elections that, in part, were supposed to be held since 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunction due to overheating on iPods have been reported, with a total of six that caught fire causing minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has reported being aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of another 34 overheating incidents, which the company had described as "not serious."
The Ministry responded by defining the communication delay from Apple as "quite regrettable."
The earthquake struck Marianis at 7:19 in the morning local time (Friday at 9:19 in the evening GMT).
The Northern Marian Emergency Management Office said no damage was reported in the state.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman took a group of tourists from Hong Kong hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Various items have been secured and it has been confirmed that for now at least six people have lost their lives.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, had been released earlier, as well as the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers took the place of an elderly lady who needed the restroom. Mendoza was executed.
Liggin went to follow in his father's footsteps and started a career in medicine.
He studied as a midwife and in 1959 he started working in the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While he was working in the hospital, Liggins began to study preterm births in his free time.
Her research showed that the administration of a hormone accelerated the fetal lung maturation of the child.
According to Xinhua, Wednesday the government investigators found two 'black boxes' with flight recorders.
Other wrestling fighters have also honored Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a Monday night, something unique just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was strange like me... maybe even more... I love her dearly and I will miss her... I hope she is in a better place than this."
Of the 1,400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal elections, those who were against Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent compared to 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those interviewed have the same opinion and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
According to the survey results, 29 percent of respondents want Australia to become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent do not want Australia to ever become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal would have had to swim the 100 meters and the 200 meters in freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his disorders, his physical condition was in doubt.
He was not able to get the medicines he needed to relieve the pain because they are prohibited by the doping regulations.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number in history.
More people have verified the discovery using various hardware and software in early February, and the discovery was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of water for Earth and also of organic matter that can form proteins and thus support life.
The scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how the Earth was formed, considering that comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo (53 years old) became governor at the beginning of the year and last month he signed a law for the legalization of same-sex marriages.
He said that the voices were "political absurdities and stupidities".
It is said that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, will help planes fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses technology based on satellites, in contrast to older technology based on ground radar, to allow air traffic controllers to track aircraft with greater precision and provide more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transfers will be added and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parks or park-and-ride facilities there are not available.
The fear of lack of transports has led to the hypothesis that the match will have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
According to researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden, the species developed in just two generations, even though it was believed this process would take much longer, due to the reproduction between a Darwin's finch (endemic species), Geospiza fortis, and the cactus finch (immigrant species), Geospiza conirostris.
The gold can be worked to give it all sorts of shapes and it can also be shaped into small forms.
You can pull it by making it become a thread until it can be twisted and stretched. You can hit or flatten it into sheets.
You can make it very fine and you can stick it onto other surfaces. You can make it so fine that sometimes it was used to decorate manuscripts made by hand called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called chemical pH. An indicator can be created through the cabbage juice extract.
The hood's fabric changes color on too acidic or basic (alkaline) substances, which are the chemical substances.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemical substances.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms are made of a proton and an electron).
The two dry powders need to be mixed together and then, with clean and wet hands, you have to form a ball.
The moisture of your hands reacts with the external layers, this will give a strange sensation and form a sort of coating.
Almost all the houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with a drainage system connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
They have been found traces of sewage systems in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, in Persia, and in China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes also found in public baths, which were open both to men and to women.
When someone who is far away calls one of my phones, a satellite is used.
The space satellite receives the call and then reflects it down almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by means of a missile. Scientists use space telescopes because Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and vision.
To send a satellite or a telescope into space, a gigantic missile is required, taller than 100 feet.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest advantage that the wheel has given us is that transportation has become much faster and easier.
We brought the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Under these, there are also medium-sized felines that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there also exist many smaller felines (like house cats) that eat much smaller and more numerous prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special skill that every feline has, which prevents them from being in competition with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called prides.
In the prides, there are usually one to three adult males and up to thirty females and young ones.
Men usually are closely related, as it is a large family of brothers and sons.
The prides of lions behave in a manner similar to wolf packs or dogs, animals that surprisingly resemble lions in behavior (but not other big cats) and are driven by the females.
A true athlete, the tiger can climb (although not very well), swim, jump a great distance, and pull with a strength five times greater than that of a strong man.
The tiger is part of the same group (or Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as full as that of the lion, but it sounds more like a growl, like when it barks.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and if they manage, even birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find their prey (or their food) through their sense of smell, by sniffing the ground where the prey has been.
They can see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and also move in a very stealthy manner. Ocelots catch prey by camouflaging with the environment and then jumping onto the prey.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) becomes separated from the main population of origin (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they go to a new island from which it is difficult to return), they find themselves in an environment different from where they were before.
This new environment has diverse resources and various challenges, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to become a good competitor compared to what was required of them before.
The original population hasn't changed at all and still needs the same adjustments as before.
With time, as the new population starts to adapt to the new environment, it begins to resemble less and less the other population.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will have an appearance so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and an important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (that is to say, they release it through breathing).
Friulian sentence: The plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
Men build houses and clothes using plants. Most of the men's food is plants, and without plants, the animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, so it was not afraid of anything, except other mosasaurs.
Her long jaws were tempestuous with more than seventy sharp teeth, aligned with another row of teeth in the mouth's sky, so there was no escape for whatever or whoever stood before it.
It is not known for certain, but it might have had a double-pointed tongue. Its diet included ammonites, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it might have also been cannibalistic.
He would also attack anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex wouldn't have been able to compete with him.
Even though most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans had their share of unusual or strange things to eat, such as wild boar, peacock, dormice, and a type of rodent called glir.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the women ate their food sitting on chairs, the men of higher status liked to dine in company reclining on their side while they ate.
The diets of the ancient Romans could not include foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever looked for turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was regarded as the house of the god.
The people brought sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to take care of the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then a sanctuary inside where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes towers in the shape of pyramids, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The priest of Thor was the special sanctuary of the god.
In the harsh climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the lives of Jewish families turned to the open.
The women used to eat in the courtyard; the shops were just open counters that faced the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
The Greenland was colonized in a scattered way. The northern sagas say that Erik the Red had been exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further West, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
The tribes of Eskimos already lived there at that time.
Even though every nation was 'Scandinavian', there were a lot of differences between the peoples, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the film National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map has been painted on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Of course, here's the translation: "Anyway, it's not true. Even if something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map."
Written on the back of the declaration of independence are the words “Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th of July 1776.” The text appears on the bottom of the document, underneath.
Even if no one knows for sure who wrote them, it is known that at the beginning of its life, the large parchment of the document (which measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) had been made to be discarded.
Therefore, it is likely that the notation was added just to label.
The landing in Normandy and the subsequent battles had liberated the North of France, but the South was not yet free.
He was governed by the French of "Vichy". These were the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon."
In just two weeks, the American and French forces had liberated Southern France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large enough group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The word "civiltât" derives from the Latin "civilis," which means "civil," related to the Latin "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," which means "city" or "city-state," and in some way also defines the dimension of a society.
The city-states were the precursors of nations. A civilized culture implies the passage of knowledge across different generations, a cultural imprint that persists and an equitable diffusion.
Minor cultures are slowly disappearing without leaving evident historical marks and are not recognized as actual civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War period, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with the congress as the sole component - under the articles of confederation.
At the congress, there was no power to impose taxes, and, since it was not an executive or national magistrature, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
He did not even have the authority to prevail over the fiscal laws and the tariffs between the states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be sent, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national soccer team, together with the German national soccer team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
The most popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, swimming, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the seventh-largest island nation in the world!
Due to the group of islands that Japan has, from a geographic point of view Japan is often called an "archipelago".
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 17th century when European sailors passing by recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established its base in the southwest of Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the native practices of grain production by employing Chinese workers to work in the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the army of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western part of Taiwan and its northern territories and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration is still ongoing today.
For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant size of film at the end of the analog film era.
And it is still produced today, but more importantly, the relationship has been inherited from the formats of digital image sensors.
The 35 mm format is a bit inaccurate, in fact it is 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the easiest ratio in whole numbers) is therefore called 3:2.
Several common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are companions of this relationship or go quite closely together.
The rule of thirds, often overused and sometimes ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism by maintaining a sense of order in an image.
It establishes that the most effective position for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, ended up under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion had united the states of Europe despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power influenced everyone from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds should be used specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and wealth led to many questions about whether this principle had been respected.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, the United Kingdom imposed a naval embargo on Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even if this embargo violated international law generally accepted and codified by many international agreements of the past two centuries.
The United Kingdom has driven international agreements to prevent any ship from entering certain sections of the ocean, causing danger even for neutral ships.
Since there had been a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response for its unrestricted submarine warfare.
At the beginning of the 20th century, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, the nations wished to guard against these situations in the future.
In 1884 Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison company in the city of New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different periods of time; each phase of China or each ruling family was a characteristic dynasty.
With more rain, within every dynasty and afterwards there was an unstable era of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms Era, which lasted for 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin.
In those times, there were bitter disputes among a series of nobles who fought for the throne.
That of the three realms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting to sit on the highest throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
They are a lot of social and political effects like the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
With more opportunities, after the revolution, the positions were open to all male candidates, allowing the more ambitious and skilled to succeed.
That is valid for the military because military rankings, instead of being based on class, were now based on ability.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other nations to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that go beyond the life of this world. He often visited a place known as “Hira” on the mountain of “Noor” (light) to meditate.
The same Koran, which has survived through time, gives a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Placed on the peak of one of the mountains north of Meche, the thief is completely isolated from the rest of the mountain.
In the underworld it is not easy even to find it even if one knows that it exists. Once inside the labyrinth, there is complete isolation.
There is nothing to be seen except the clear, beautiful sky above and all the mountains surrounding it. One can see or hear very little of the world outside from within this gorge.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still remains intact today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the great pyramid is part of the many large pyramid structures made to honor the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (and the Great Pyramid is the largest), many small tombs, several temples, and the great sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the other smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected to honor the women and family members of Khufu.
The symbol of the "arc up" looks like a V and the "arc down" symbol resembles a bracket or a square without the bottom part.
Up means starting at the bridge and pushing the bow, down means starting from the frog (where the hand is holding the bow) and pulling the bow.
An "up bow" usually creates a softer sound, whereas a "down bow" is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to mark your signs with a pencil, but note that the markings for passing through the arch are printed there for a musical reason, so they should be respected.
King Louis XVI, terrified, Queen Marie Antoinette and their young children (Marie Thérèse aged 11 and Louis Charles aged four) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, on October 6, 1789, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting and voicing threats against the king and the queen.
The children forced the king and the queen to fling open the carriage windows.
At a certain point, one of the kids kicked the head of one of the royal guards killed at Versailles into the lap of the terrified queen.
The costs of wars of imperialism by the United States in the conquest of the Philippines will be paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to support a large part of the expenses and the interest on the bonds was changed in the name of the Philippine government in the midst of Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly, the big profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic advantages of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The High Middle Ages is when the events unfold and is usually called the High Middle Age, the period of European history in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around the year 1500.
The term "technological determinism" encompasses a range of ideas, from technological pushes or technological imperatives to a strict sense that the fate of humans is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: that the development of technology follows an independent path regardless of cultural and political influences, and that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one can say that the automobile inevitably leads to road development.
In any case, a national road network is not economically accessible only for a large number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce costs for those who want to be car owners.
Mass motorization also leads to more road incidents, a fact that leads to the development of new medical techniques to treat damaged bodies.
The Romanticism had a great element of cultural determinism, as portrayed by writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures associated with that geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than the arbitrary laws imposed.
Just as Paris, which today is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation for being a center of light began in 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
Its status declined around the 12th century, mainly because the crusaders returned bringing goods like silks and spices that were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was in that period that the title of fashion capital moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak during the period between the 11th - early 12th century and the 14th century.
At the beginning, the clothing was quite influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
In any case, due to the slowness of the communication channels, the people in the West could remain behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments of that time as a result of the Crusades was that people started using buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is a type of farming carried on to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple and often organic system that uses locally adapted seeds native to the ecological region, combined with crop rotation or other fairly simple techniques to maximize yield.
In history, most of the farmers were employed in subsistence agriculture, and it is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar mindsets who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive for the age, ethnicity, class, position, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging with the distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is that of examining the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, have not been socialized by the adults around them during their upbringing.
These children were called "fierce" or wild. Some wild children were kept locked up (usually by the parents); in some cases the child's abandonment was due to the parents' rejection of a child with a severe physical or intellectual disability.
The wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others think that they were raised by animals; some say that he lived wild on his own.
When they are completely raised by non-human animals, wild children exhibit behaviors almost entirely similar (within physical limits) to those of the particular animal that raised them, such as their fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but rather a support that aids individuals who are experiencing a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffold can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold but it can also be the little paperclip guy from Microsoft Office.
Virtual frameworks are incorporated into the software and are designed to make inquiries, assist, and explain procedures that may be too difficult to manage for the user alone.
The children are given into care for a variety of reasons that range from abandonment to abuse and even to extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not caring, affectionate, and educational, but it happens.
We perceive the foster system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide secure homes, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The foster care arrangement is designed to provide for all the needs that were lacking in the home where the children were taken from.
Internet brings together elements typical of mass communication and those of interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the internet have brought an additional dimension to the uses and gratifications theory.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are suggested as important motivations for the use of the internet (James and others, 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" were identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated the audience's reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro expressions, muscle movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can perceive if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article “The President’s Speech,” indicated that people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that these abilities in interpreting human behavior can be shared by animals like domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variations: latent and apparent.
The mutation adds new genetic varieties, and selection removes them from the set of manifest variations.
Segregation and recombination turn forward and backward the variety between the two sets with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet the demand for amino acids with the available plant resources.
With more, the failure in the field leads to serious consequences: slowed growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins from leaves and fruits, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us if they are not cooked.
Instead of eating animals (ants, termites, eggs), not only is it easy to digest, but it also provides a large amount of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
Considering all things, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" more or less in the same way that savannah chimpanzees do today.
Interruption of sleep is the process of waking up outside the normal sleep period and returning to sleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily using a sufficiently quiet alarm that brings you into consciousness without fully waking you.
If the alarm clock is placed across the room, one is forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking a lot of fluids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before going to sleep, forcing oneself to wake up to urinate.
The amount of peace that a person has inside is inversely related to the amount of tension in the body and in the spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the present vital force. Every person has the potential to find total peace and harmony.
Everybody can attain enlightenment. The only thing that prevents reaching the goal is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by several Indian yoga techniques.
At the beginning, Tibetan Buddhism is quite easy. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love that embraces everything.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The heart of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of divinity. Through the visualization of a variety of deities, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, the clash of systems, processes, and cultures led to disagreements between these nations.
After two years since the end of the war, the allies of once were now enemies and the Cold War was beginning.
And it would have lasted for the following 40 years and would have been truly fought by armies by proxy, on battlefields in Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup on the Romanian bridgehead.
All these plans had been rendered almost obsolete overnight when 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga peace treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is one of the most efficient ways to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
By tradition, the work of mariners was to ensure that their own nation maintained the ability to move people and goods, and at the same time, to interfere with the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans tried to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help the United Kingdom.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have managed to conquer the United Kingdom as it had done with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
English sentence: Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that grazed on hills or other pasture areas, often tended by shepherds who were often children or young people, in a manner similar to the more well-known sheep shepherds. These methods of leading the animals to pasture are still used today.
The iron wheels for carts were already being made in England in the 16th century.
Even if the rails for the carts consisted only of parallel wooden beams, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and carry larger loads than those on the slightly rougher roads of that time.
The railroads were introduced quite late to keep the tracks in place. Sometimes, however, it was understood that the tracks would have been more efficient if they had strips of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but iron was used more for the wooden wheels of the carts.
In the end, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron wheel was introduced.
The first means of transport known is walking; humans began to walk around two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright habitually.
Biped specializations are found in australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
You can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, you can join environmental movements, and you can also become activists to partially reduce future suffering.
This is exactly like symptomatic treatment in many cases. In any case, if you do not want just a temporary solution, then you should find the root of the problems and disable it.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological developments of humanity, and the problems have become bigger due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by the congress on July 4, a handwritten copy signed by the president of the congress, John Hancock, and the secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent to a few distant places to be printed by John Dunlap's printing presses.
The night before last they printed between 150 and 200 copies, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on the 8th of July.
A letter was sent, on July 6th, to George Washington who received it in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of that document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
A number of paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are a lot of things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have feathers with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on two legs behind like a T-Rex.
In practice, all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits – or bits, using computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are quite generic and may not allow for an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open container of medications or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term "pudiese" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term is based on an ancient familiarity with lice, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Sit the bedbugs, sit the fleas that are nocturnal insects, adapted to live in the nest or in the host's dwelling.
In the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young people and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Research has discovered that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple can then decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the interest of their child, to raise a child.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their children.
In an adoption, the natural parents end their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to discover how the world works through scientific methods. This method is indeed the basis for most scientific research.
It is not by itself, however, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, also to ask questions and make observations to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's opinions on all scientific arguments, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from the Greek sources of philosophy and science.
Many have observed rhythms in physiology, and behavior often crucially depends on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only responses to external periodic signals, have been documented in most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that carry forward a period of cyclicity of free running even without external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to inject their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments by marking the DNA in the bacteriophages with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the bacteriophages with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells were germline cells.
Only the mutations in the germline cells can be passed on to the children, whereas mutations in other cell types can lead to cell death or cancer.
Tourism based on nature attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plants and wild animals.
Examples of outdoor activities include mowing, fishing, photographing, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information regarding the ecosystem.
An example is to visit, photograph, and learn something about the behavior of orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country villages by car to go to work, crossing paths with those whose work destination is the place they have just left.
In this system of dynamic transport, everyone in some way supports and is connected with a transport system based on private automobiles.
Scientific evidence now indicates that this large-scale carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
All participate in society and use the transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed nations, such high levels of complaints regarding water quality or falling bridges are rarely heard.
Why do the transportation systems generate these complaints, why do they fail every other day? Are the transport engineers really incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
The flow of traffic is the study of the movement of cars and individual vehicles between two bridges and the interaction they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, the drivers tend to behave within a fairly constant range; thus, traffic currents tend to have a certain consistency and can be represented in an approximately mathematical way.
To better represent the flow of traffic, the relationships have been established among three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These reports help in the planning, design, and management of road infrastructures.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings down along their body.
This gives them a better choice of small places to hide from predators.
Today the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus asserted that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Someone believed that he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even those other stars).
This seems sensible, because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with its width reaching up to six miles.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It draws water from a thousand smaller rivers.
Even though the construction of stone pyramids went on until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza have never been surpassed in terms of dimensions and technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which at that time were thousands of years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent nation in the world and the nation with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
The Italian is also the language used by most of those who work in that state where Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as these can be found in nature in native form and are quite easy to extract with primitive techniques.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of four elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, even though he had also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
At their core, compounds are the mixture of two or more parts. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Friulian sentence: I elements come il calci e il potassi a son considerâts metai. Clâr che a son ancje metai come l’arint e l’aur. English sentence: Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Clearly, there are also metals like silver and gold.
They can also have laws that include small quantities of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit on the full stop at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend for many people when it came out.
It's a shame that, since new writing methods have emerged, the pencil has been relegated to a minor position and use.
Now people write messages on computer screens without ever having to approach a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb operates on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus containing several protons and neutrons.
More or less like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Splitting the nucleus once more released some of that energy at that moment.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus and this means that they are prone to split with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the closest side and 100 km thick on the farthest side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the plateaus.
There could be more seas on the closer side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise up to the surface.
The theories of content are focused on finding what pleases or displeases people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized during their maturation toward adulthood.
These theories look at how certain people act so that they desire the things they want and which things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when managers start to express their opinions openly. On one end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or gals).
This kind of administrator has difficulty making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, assessing performance, delegating responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she has to change everything that the group was doing and make it their own.
In the end, the leader is essentially responsible for the success or failure of the group.
This behavior often results in conflicts between the leader and the rest of the group.
Virtual groups are treated with the same level of excellence as conventional groups, but there are subtle differences.
Members of the virtual group often function as a bridge of contact for their immediate physical group.
Later, the members of the conventional group will have more autonomy since their group can meet according to various time zones that might not be understood by local management.
Even the presence of a true “invisible group” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is a unique component of a virtual group.
The "invisible group" is the management group to which every member reports. The invisible group sets the criteria for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through a time-consuming process to create a learning organization? One purpose of putting the concepts of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
When all the available resources are used efficiently in all the operational departments of an organization, creativity and innovation can be revealed.
As a result, the process of an organization that works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the needs of the customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as a shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous methodologies as methods used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence of a theoretical method in cognitive investigation. Therefore, they narrow the research area and make it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that the different types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and cancers affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The birth of new technologies allows us to see and investigate the structures and processes of the brain never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes of our mind.
Even though AI has strong connotations of science fiction, AI forms a very important field of computer science, which manages behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI leads to creating machines for automatic functions that require intelligent behavior.
The examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer requests, as well as handwriting, voice and music recognition.
These matters have become separate disciplines, which focus on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is often used today in the fields of economy, medicine, engineering, and in the military field, as it has been incorporated into many home computers and software applications for video games.
Goats are an important part of every village. Sometimes a teacher would very much like to take their students to places where the bus ride is not possible.
Technology offers a solution with virtual tours. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful piece of art while they are seated in class.
Sharing a virtual trip is also a way to reflect on a journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of the Bennet school in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; each year the website is newly modeled, but the old versions are kept online to serve as diaries.
Blogs can also improve the way students write. Usually, students start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, but the presence of an audience usually changes them.
Since the students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to commit to improving the writing and avoiding criticism.
With more, write a blog that "compels students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to foster public interest inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Writing a blog is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning well beyond traditional school days.
A suitable use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by responding actively to internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' writings as well as outline their points of view on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the bilingual capital city of Canada and offers an assortment of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and the north is the homeland of natural beauty in the Muskoka area and beyond.
All these things and others still highlight Ontario as what is considered quintessentially Canadian by foreigners.
Larger areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some are wild nature and almost uninhabited.
To make a population comparison that surprises many people: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is a beautiful large piece, and a continent by itself when referring to its wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or connected to France, and are famous as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it was well received in the Comoros and in Mayotte.
The influence and European colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the route from the Cape of Europe to India.
In the North the region is bounded by the Sahel, and in the South and West by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that any traveler say they are married, regardless of their actual civil status.
He also considers having a ring (but not one that seems too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they consider annoyances, and it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, and led on.
You have to be firm in refusing men, and don't be afraid to maintain your position (cultural differences or not, it doesn't mean that it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by a Berber fisherman in the 10th century AD, and it was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese had destroyed it and rebuilt it anew under the name of Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt it as Daru I-Badya and the name Casablanca was given by the Spanish merchants who had established their trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco to buy.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find stalls that sell traditional Moroccan goods, like tagine, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a lot of trinkets, but it is all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the streets, especially in the city center.
Even though Goma is quite safe, for all visits outside of Goma, it is necessary to investigate to understand the situation of the conflicts occurring in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, along with some of the more affordable itineraries to see mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (a motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) fare is about 500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, “Timbuktu” has ended up being used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today Timbuktu is a diminished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of desert encroachment.
It was one of the longest broadcasts ever of the PBS special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is in sharp contrast with the rest of the nation's cities because it has a style more Arab than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and to the south, the border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a diverse wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered a diamond bridge among the national parks of South Africa. (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily conservation fees and park entry fees.
It could be beneficial to buy a Wild Card, which provides entry to either a selection of South African parks or all the national parks of South Africa.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider the main center.
The row of buildings that create the profile of Hong Kong has been compared to a bar graph that shines, evidencing the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To have the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
The vast majority of urban development on the island of Hong Kong is built on the reclaimed land stretching along its northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonizers appropriated, so if you seek evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into the interiors of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not only mangrove swamps: they include some of the last areas of trees of the immense jungle that once covered the plain of the Ganges.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which one third is covered by water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (beyond the river) throughout the day, although most, particularly those heading towards East and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since the interdistrict buses are often full, it is better to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese minibuses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a fast and common means of transportation for traveling to nearby places, like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a suspension bridge with cables. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes each 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, and it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be fully operational by September 2017, when the works on the Brazilian customs will be finished.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The region of Chaco was the territory of other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was born, initially called "The Giant Province of the Indies", as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the period of colonization which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its indigenous character and identity.
The Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December in the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Here they can watch small tournaments and matches also during other times of the year.
For news about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), and its value is set equivalent to that of a British pound (GBP).
The currency can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is in Stanley on the other side of the FIC West Store.
The British pound is generally accepted throughout the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the more remote islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, even if they can take English and American currencies; check with the owners first to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland currency outside of the islands, so exchange the currency before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer here when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is subtropical; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
The winter can be insidiously cold: the temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the combination of air and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particular "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains more or less the same throughout the year.
Even if some of the park's animals are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild, and one should not feed or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, you must stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
It doesn’t matter how many mosquitos can add up, bison, wapiti, elk, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Each year dozens of visitors get hurt because they did not respect the adequate distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
With the rain, be careful that the smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying around or cooking strong-smelling food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sent under, with the exception of a single English cruiser. Almost 200 American and German lives are considered lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the shooting of the sovereign chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are a lot of beaches, thanks to the fact that Auckland is situated between two harbors. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches of Cueste Nord (in the district of North Harbour) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the North to Devonport in the South.
There are almost all swimming spots where swimming is safe and most of them have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive neighborhoods of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are places for families, sometimes full of people, with a good variety of shops along the street. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number one', it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are a lot of French wines to try, but New Zealand and Australian wines travel better.
The local tap water is very safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're cautious.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign. An espresso is called 'neri curt', a cappuccino comes full of milk cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The chocolate waffles are at the Belgian level. The apple strudels are expensive but excellent.
A lot of trips to the coral barrier are made throughout the year, and accidents for one of these reasons on the coral barrier are rare.
With all that, listen to the advice of the authorities, obey all the signs, and pay close attention to the safety warnings.
The box jellyfish are found near the beaches and estuaries of rivers from October to April north of 1770. They can also occasionally be found outside of this period.
Sharks do exist, but it is rare for them to attack humans. Most sharks are scared of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean; their main habitat is the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the mental peace of having a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, although a travel agent can also book other types of accommodations, like camping.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also block the booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (for example, the visa).
Any changes or requests, however, must first go through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
For other festivals, most of those who participate in music festivals choose to camp on site, and most of the participants consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to stay close to the action, you will have to arrive early to find a place to stay close to the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stage may be finished, there can be other sections of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night.
Some events have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the Northern Baltic in winter, check the position of the cabin, because crossing the ice can cause a rather terrible sound for those most affected.
The cruises in Saint Petersburg include some time in the city. The cruise passengers are exempt from the need for a visa (check the conditions).
Casinos usually strive to maximize the time and money that guests spend. Windows and clocks are typically absent, and exits are difficult to find.
Usually, they have special offers for food, drink, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and to keep them in the venue.
Some venues offer complimentary alcoholic beverages. However, being intoxicated impairs judgment, and every good player knows the importance of staying sober.
All those who want to travel at high altitudes or above mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or below-freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you can't drive as you do on dry asphalt.
