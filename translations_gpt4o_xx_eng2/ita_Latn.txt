USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and acknowledges the absolute necessity for the Olympic community to strive to create a safe environment for all its athletes.
We agree with what has been stated by the USOC, namely that the interests of our athletes and our clubs, and their sport, can be better served by pursuing significant change within our organization, and not by decertification.
USA Gymnastics has launched an independent investigation to understand how an abuse of the magnitude described so courageously by those who survived Larry Nassar could have remained hidden for so long, and is willing to implement any necessary or appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible, so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a reliable, positive, and empowering environment.
During the 1960s, Brzezinski was an advisor to John F. Kennedy and later to the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely accepted, but provides more details than fossils do, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on the upper part, with a pale or carotenoid coloring on the lower part.
The discovery also provides detailed information regarding the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the dinosaur's plumage does not have the basic structure, the so-called rachis, but instead possesses other features typical of feathers, such as barbs and barbules, researchers have concluded that the rachis is probably the result of an evolutionary development following these characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship. The researchers hypothesize that, although it is a young dinosaur's tail, the specimen shows adult plumage rather than chick down.
According to researchers' hypotheses, although the tail belongs to a young dinosaur, the specimen reveals adult plumage and not that of a chick.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two officers and injuring over twenty people.

They have discovered that the functioning of the Sun is based on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the solar system is determined by nothing other than their luminosity and rotation.
The brightness is used together with rotation to define the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic reversals.

The activity carried out was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the surveys conducted on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect sought by the team had to be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational pull on Earth that generates tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to deduce that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same effects that "normal" matter has.
This theory holds that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is gathered in a sort of halo, formed by a multitude of small particles.
Television reports show the white smoke coming out of the plant.

Dr. Tony Moll identified extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.
According to a statement released in an interview, this new variant was "highly concerning and alarming, due to the high mortality rate".
According to Dr. Moll, some patients may have contracted the microbe inside the hospital, and at least two of them were hospital healthcare workers.
Over the course of a year, an infected person can end up infecting between 10 and 15 close contacts.

Infrared images show thermal oscillations between day and night, indicating that they are probably caves.
During the day they are cooler than the surrounding surface and at night they are warmer.
Glen Cushing of the team of astrogeologists from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona, stated: "Their thermal behavior is not as constant as that of large terrestrial caves, which often maintain a relatively stable temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground."
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters enter an isolated booth and place a pre-printed ballot indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the verification of their identity by the officials, the voter deposits the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral register.
The French electoral law codifies the procedures in a rather rigorous manner.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that at the start of voting there are no envelopes present and that no others are inserted besides those of the voters, duly counted and authorized.
Candidates may send their representatives to attend every stage of the process. In the evening, the volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, in accordance with specific procedures.

Huhne has resigned and will be replaced in the government by Ed Davey MP. Norman Lamb MP is expected to take on the role of Minister for Business left vacant by Davey.
The appearance of Huhne and Pryce at the Westminster Magistrates' Court is scheduled for February 16.
The victims were Nicholas Alden, 25, and the driver, Zachary Cuddeback, 21.
Edgar Veguilla sustained injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider will have to undergo facial reconstructive surgery.
Uka's weapon did not explode when it was aimed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider is in constant pain, is blind in one eye, is missing a section of his skull, and his face has been reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via videoconference from a U.S. Air Force base in his country.
In addition to Wednesday's event, Carpanedo participated in two individual races of the Championships.
The first in the slalom, where in the first run she recorded a DNF. Another 36 competitors out of 116 in the same race did not finish the event.
The other race she participated in, the giant slalom, saw her place tenth in the women's "sitting" category, with a combined run time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first place finisher, Austria's Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Hungary's Gyöngyi Dani, who finished ninth.
Four female skiers from the women's group did not finish their descents, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom did not qualify in the race.
The police of Madhya Pradesh managed to recover the laptop and the cell phone that had been stolen.
Deputy Inspector General, DK Arya, announced: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman. We have also recovered her cell phone and her laptop."
The names of the defendants are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the car crash were injured.
Nevertheless, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The street where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since that moment, Adekoya has been at the Edinburgh sheriff court charged with killing her own son.
She is detained awaiting indictment and trial, but any testimony given by an eyewitness could be tainted, as her image has been widely published.
It is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice has different standards. In fact, Scottish courts have deemed the publication of the photos potentially prejudicial.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, "journalists who publish photos or other materials of suspicious subjects are walking on a minefield."
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for legal proceedings, informed journalists that no new comments will be released at least until the formal act of accusation.
According to what has been leaked, the subject of the document will be the dispute over borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders existing before the Middle East War of 1967.
According to what is said, the other issues addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to forsake such presence for only five years.
The shooters within the experimental program for controlling harmful animals had to be closely monitored by the rangers, as the experiment was being watched and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of the association's hunting program, the NPWS, in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., has recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of Park Conservation and Heritage of the NPWS, the four marksmen for the first shooting operation received comprehensive training and safety instructions.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn into a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
It is the fifth provisional Electoral Council of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed a package of measures aimed at pushing the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The commission constituted Martelly's response to widespread protests, which began in October and contest the regime.
The occasionally violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which were scheduled as far back as 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating malfunctioning iPods have been reported, which have caused a total of six fires and resulted in minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 more incidents related to overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
In its response, the ministry called Apple's postponement of the report "absolutely reprehensible."
The earthquake tremor in the Marianas was felt at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the emergency management office of the Northern Mariana Islands, no damage has been reported in the nation.
Furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no signs of an ongoing tsunami.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle, Rolando Mendoza opened fire on the tourists.
Many of the hostages have been rescued, at least six have died.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were immediately freed along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
After completing her training in obstetrics, in 1959 she began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While serving at the hospital, in his spare time Liggins began to study cases of premature labor.
Her research showed that the administration of a hormone would have accelerated the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two 'black boxes' with flight recordings.
Even her wrestling teammates wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like her. A strong woman."
"Luna was weird like me… Maybe even more… I love her and I will miss her… Hopefully, she is in a better place," was Dustin "Goldust" Runnels' comment.
According to the survey conducted on 1,400 people before the 2010 federal elections, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the campaign for the 2010 federal elections, the interim Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, stated that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Elizabeth II.
This opinion is shared by 34% of survey participants, who believe that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
At the ends of the survey, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% are of the opinion that it should never become one.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but faced several ailments that raised doubts about their physical condition.
He couldn't take the necessary medication to overcome the pain because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets might have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter to Earth, that is, the matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form and in particular how Earth was formed, having collided with comets a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage.
According to him, the speculations are nothing but "chatter and political nonsense."
A candidacy for the presidency in 2016 is hypothesized.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow planes to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology instead of obsolete ground-based radar, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being arranged and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while on-site car parks or park-and-ride facilities are not available.
Concerns related to the lack of transportation options have raised the possibility of having the match played behind closed doors, without the support of the team's fans.
According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of birds may have emerged on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that the time required for this process was much longer; this was due to the mating between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any type of shape. It can be rolled to create tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, suitable for twisting and braiding. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. Sometimes it has been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts" precisely because of the ability to be made so thin.
It is the so-called pH of the substance. Using red cabbage juice, it is possible to create a pH indicator.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the analyzed chemical substance is determined by the quantity of hydrogen ions present (the letter H in pH).
By hydrogen ions, we mean protons from which the electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, shape them into a ball.
Between the moisture present on one's hands and the outer layers, a reaction will be triggered that will cause a strange sensation and form a sort of shell.
Almost all the houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water connected to an advanced sewage system.
In Greece, remains of sewer systems have been discovered in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini.
Toilets in ancient times also existed in Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, they were sometimes included in public baths, attended by a mixed audience of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, a satellite is used.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The launch of the satellite into space was carried out with a rocket. Scientists resort to space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts the light and the view.
To transport a satellite or a telescope into space, a rocket more than 100 feet tall is needed.
The wheel has enormously changed the world. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important is that it has provided us with simpler and faster transportation.
Thanks to his invention, the train, the automobile, and several other means of transportation made their appearance.
Below them are other medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including free-roaming domestic cats) that feed on smaller, much more numerous prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The concept of a niche constitutes the secret of their success, a particular goal that each feline has which allows them not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called prides.
The packs are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and cubs that can reach up to 30.
Usually the females are closely related to one another, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The pride of lions acts in a way very similar to a pack of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is surprisingly analogous to that of the lions (but not to that of other big felines), even in terms of deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is capable of climbing (albeit not too well), swimming, making very long jumps, and exerting a pulling strength five times greater than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar. These four felines are the only ones that roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but it resembles more a phrase of shouted and angry words.
Ocelots love to feed on small animals. If possible, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the prey they catch are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) thanks to their sense of smell, sniffing the ground where they have been.
Thanks to night vision, they are able to see very well in the dark, in addition to being able to move stealthily. To hunt their prey, ocelots camouflage themselves with the surroundings before pouncing on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (for example, if it moves beyond a mountain range or a river, or moves to a new island, thus making a return difficult), it will likely find itself in an environment different from the one it was in before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so, to position itself as a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations compared to those needed previously.
The native population has not changed at all; it continues to need the same adaptations as before.
As time passes and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it resembles the other population less and less.
At a certain point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists of the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that is breathed by humans and absorb the carbon dioxide expelled by them (through exhalation).
The plants produce their own nourishment with the sun through photosynthesis. Additionally, they provide shade.
We build our houses starting from plants and produce clothes from plants. Much of the food we eat is made of plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the superpredator of its era and for this reason feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
From its long jaws protruded more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an additional row located on the palate, so for anyone who crossed its path there was no escape.
We do not know for sure, but it is possible that it had a forked tongue. Its diet consisted of turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it is also possible that it was a cannibal.
It attacked anything that entered the water; even a gigantic dinosaur like the T-Rex could not have competed with it.
Although much of their food would appear familiar to us, Roman banquets also included several strange or unusual courses, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, wealthy men enjoyed feasting together while lying on their side as they consumed their meal.
Naturally, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include various foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each deity, which was considered the dwelling of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to the priests.
Sometimes, particular pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
Much of the Jewish family's life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard, while the shops were simple open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red gave it its name, having encountered Greenland during his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of his discovery, at that time the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Even though they are all "Scandinavian" countries, the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you have seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Anyway, this is false. Even if there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, there is the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776." The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is well-known that at the beginning of its existence the large parchment document (measuring 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up for storage.
Probably, therefore, the annotation was added just as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing battles had led to the liberation of the north of France, but the south was still occupied.
It was governed by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French people who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and had allied with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive action was named "Operation Dragoon".
The American forces and those of the Free French had liberated the south of France in just two weeks and were heading toward Germany.
A civilization is understood as a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, forming a society.
The word civilization derives from the Latin "civilis", which means civil; the term is in turn connected with "civis", that is citizen, and "civitas", that is city or city-state, and in a certain way thus also defines the dimensions of society.
City-states are the first entities to anticipate the idea of a nation. Culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge across multiple generations, leaving an indelible cultural imprint through equitable dissemination.
Lesser cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces, thus not being recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed for the first time a weak central government, and Congress was its only component, according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes and, given the absence of an executive or judicial power at the national level, relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, for the enforcement of its acts.
He didn't even have the authority to bypass tax laws and duties between states.
To amend the articles, the unanimous consent of all the states was necessary. For their part, they had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German team, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are: soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are mostly popular in the northern regions, and Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu) are part of Japan, making it the seventh-largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical point of view, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago," considering the presence of groups of islands that compose it.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century when European sailors, who were passing through, shortly recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or marvelous island.
The Dutch East India Company in 1624 established a base in the southwest part of Taiwan, initiating a transformation regarding the indigenous people's grain production systems and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of the Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, thus ceding the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan; the island would remain under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
A large part of the peripheral buildings has been rebuilt to give tourists a more precise idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of the Machu Picchu site had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The most common format worldwide for still image photography, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the most used film at the end of the analog photography era.
It is still produced today and, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strangely, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of whole numbers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (for example, the APS format family) are equal to or very close to this value.
The much-exploited and often mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point to place the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage of European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, found itself under scrutiny.
The Christian religion had acted as a glue between the European states for over a thousand years, despite linguistic and cultural differences.
His omnipresent power has influenced everyone, from the king to the common citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the monetary reserves of the church exist precisely for this reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years, and this convergence of power and money has led many to wonder whether this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Great Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective: it involved halting any essential military and civilian supply, despite this blockade violating international law usually embraced and codified by multiple international treaties over the last two centuries.
The United Kingdom mined international waters to prevent any vessel from accessing entire sections of the ocean, putting even neutral ships at risk.
Since this tactic had elicited a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its campaign of indiscriminate submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer at the Edison Company in New York City, and this led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job) addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, the different periods of time were indicated in a very unique way: each period of China or each ruling family constituted a specific dynasty.
The intervals between the individual dynasties were also characterized by periods of instability and division among the provinces. The most well-known was the so-called Three Kingdoms period, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
In these times, among many nobles fighting for the throne, fierce wars broke out.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent eras in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to earn a place of honor in the imposing palace of Xi'an.
The social and political effects are numerous, among these one can cite the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to a republic, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and is not the property of a single sovereign.
Moreover, after the Revolution, professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same applies to the military, since army rankings, instead of being based on class, are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers in various countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad harbored a deep interest in matters beyond earthly life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, provides a very clear picture of Muhammad's spirituality in itself.
The cave rests on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
Actually, it is not at all easy to find, even if its existence was known. Once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
Nothing else can be seen but a wonderful clear sky and a great number of mountains around. From inside the cave, one can see or hear very little of the surrounding world.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has survived to the present day not in ruins.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures erected in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, is home to numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), various smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the pharaoh's wives and family members.
The indication "arcata in su" looks like a V, and the indication "arcata in giù" resembles a paperclip or a square missing the bottom side.
Upward means that you should start from the tip and push the bow, and downward means that you should start from the frog (which is where the hand supports the bow) and pull the bow towards yourself.
An ascending bow usually produces a softer sound, while a descending bow results in a stronger and more decisive sound.
You can choose to add your personalized indications in pencil, but keep in mind that the printed markings you find have musical significance, so they should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of market women forced King Louis XVI, in a state of terror, to leave Versailles to return to Paris, along with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Maria Teresa, 11 years old, and Louis Charles, 4 years old) and Elisabeth, the king's sister.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and yelling threats against the sovereigns.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At a certain point, someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The war expenses of U.S. imperialism incurred to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the United States colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses, and the interest on the bonds fluctuated in the name of the Filipino government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly, the enormous profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people were the basis of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history that covers the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or the technological imperative to the strict sense in which the fate of man is driven by an underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
A large part of the interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the automobile necessarily entails the development of the road network.
However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically sustainable, therefore new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs associated with car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher percentage of road accidents, and consequently the invention of new rescue techniques for the care of injured people.
The Romanticism was characterized by a significant component of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the framework of Romanticism, geography has influenced individuals, and over time, customs and culture linked to such geography have arisen, which, being in harmony with the context of society, have proven more effective than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Similarly to Paris, known today as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital in feudal Europe.
Its renown as a nerve center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued approximately until 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century, its prestige decreased, mainly due to the fact that the crusaders returned bringing gifts like silk and spices, which were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of Gothic style was reached during the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by the Eastern Byzantine culture.
But the slowness of communication routes means that the spread of styles in the West can be delayed by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the era, as a result of the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons for fastening clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence farming when it is practiced solely to produce enough to meet the food needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, usually organic, that uses seeds preserved from the ecological region in association with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at maximizing yields.
Historically, a large number of farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries, it is still so.
Subcultures bring together individuals with the same opinions, who do not feel represented by society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished based on the age, ethnicity, social class, position, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Often members of a subculture indicate their belonging through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners, and argot.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, misfortunes, or intentional abuse, have grown up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some of them have been secluded by people (often their own parents): in certain cases, the abandonment is motivated by the parents' rejection of a severe intellectual or physical disability.
Feral children may have experienced severe violence or trauma before abandonment or escape.
Other children might have been raised by animals; others still seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral child is completely raised by non-human animals, they exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular animal that took care of them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning should make learning itself simpler and more interesting, while the scaffolding goes a bit further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help for those embarking on a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding," but so is the small paperclip assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to question, prompt, and explain the procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, and even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not provide them with nourishment, care, and education, but that happens to them.
We believe that foster care represents a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The foster care is supposed to meet all the unmet needs of the home from which they were removed.
The Internet brings together elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the uses and gratifications theory.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord's (1998) study on public reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships."
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that it is possible to discover if a person is lying by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
In his essay "The President’s Speech," Oliver Sacks illustrated how people unable to understand spoken language due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even claims that such skills in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research demonstrated the existence of two pools of genetic variability, namely hidden variability and expressed variability.
With mutation, a new genetic variability is added, and with selection, it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variability.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to meet its amino acid requirements with the plant resources available in the savannah.
Moreover, the failure to carry out such activities has serious consequences: slowed growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, even death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, they are difficult to digest unless cooked.
Animal foods, on the other hand (such as ants, termites, eggs), are not only easy to digest but also provide a high amount of protein, containing all essential amino acids.
In light of all this, it should not be surprising that our very ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way similar to how savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional waking that occurs during the normal sleep period, followed by a resumption of sleep (10–60 minutes later).
This process can be easily put into practice using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to a state of consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you should decide to reset the clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you'll be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-focused options include consuming plenty of liquids before sleeping (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force you to get out of bed to urinate.
A person enjoys inner peace in proportion to the opposite tension existing in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the existing life force is. Each of us has the potential capacity to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. This goal is hindered only by our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been enriched by the path of love of the Mahayana rite and various techniques of Indian yoga.
Generally speaking, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is based on Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and a path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini Yoga activates Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) through the use of yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the core of Tibetan meditation. Through the depiction of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is developed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to collaboration between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, systemic, procedural, and cultural conflicts caused a rift between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies had become enemies; thus began the Cold War.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be truly fought by mercenary armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other countries.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been breached; the only option was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans immediately proved obsolete when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral treaties.
Using ships for transporting goods is definitely the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of navies has always been to ensure the country's ability to move people and goods, while at the same time countering the same ability of enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the recent examples supporting this theory and most noteworthy is represented by the Battle of the Atlantic during the Second World War. During the battle, the Americans attempted to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using submarines, attempted to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have had the opportunity to conquer Great Britain, just as it had done in the rest of Europe.
As it seems, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains, in Iran.
They began to be raised by the cultures and tribes of antiquity to have easy access to milk, fleece, meat, and hide.
Domestic goats were usually raised in herds that were allowed to roam freely on the hills or in other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds (similar to shepherds) who were often children or teenagers. These pastoral methods are still used today.
Already in the 16th century in England, wagonways were constructed.
Despite being formed simply by parallel wooden planks, the wagonways, when compared to the slightly rougher roads of the period, allowed the horses that traveled them to reach higher speeds and move heavier loads.
The sleepers were introduced relatively early to keep the tracks in position. Gradually, however, it was understood that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
It became a common practice, even though the iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first fully iron rails made their appearance.
The first means of transport that humans knew was their legs. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means "upright man").
Its predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not habitually walk upright.
Signs of specialization for bipedal walking are present in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate future suffering to some extent, we can start adopting more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmental movement, and also engage in activism.
In many cases, this works only as a symptomatic treatment. If, on the other hand, we do not want just a temporary solution, we should find the root cause of the problems and eliminate it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot due to humanity's scientific and technological advances, while problems have increased because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After the Congress adopted it on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the President of the Congress John Hancock and the secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to the print shop of John Dunlap a few blocks away.
In the night, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, today known as the "Dunlap Broadsides."
The document was publicly read for the first time on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall, and the task was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops stationed in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides still known are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
According to many of today's paleontologists, a category of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are what we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of the feathers and their ability to fly.
And yet birds have many characteristics in common with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they have scaly feet with claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all computers currently in use.
A binary number can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and in technical computer language, these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning might not be immediately evident. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very generic, making an immediate diagnosis impossible.
The primary indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the house of an open container of medication or harmful chemicals.
Check if the label contains first aid instructions related to that specific poison.
The term mite is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the familiarity in ancient times with bedbugs, insects that have strongly adapted to becoming human parasites.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, meaning they are adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (MS) accounts for approximately 400,000 known cases, ranking first among neurological diseases that affect young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a condition that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The research has highlighted that the probability of developing MS among females is double that of males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their interest, or in the interest of their child.
These couples have the possibility to choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method in fact guides most scientific investigation.
But it is not just about experimentation, given that an experiment is a test used to exclude one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also allows for the guidance of scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, particularly on the Latin version of the Bible.
The opinions of Aristotle on various fields of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West was isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior depend significantly on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not just reactions to external periodic signals, in relation to most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, which are viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments highlighting the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells belong to the germline.
Mutations that can be passed on to children are only those at the level of germ cells; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including the wild flora and fauna.
Among the examples of activities to do on site are hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, park visits, and studying information regarding the ecosystem.
For example, by visiting, photographing, and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small country towns to drive to work, crossing paths with others whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic hustle and bustle, everyone is somehow linked to a transportation system based on private cars, which they simultaneously support.
Today, science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere out of one of its stability conditions that has allowed human evolution for the last two million years.
Every person participates in social life and uses transportation systems, about which almost everyone complains.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints regarding the quality of water or bridges falling into disrepair.
Why do transportation systems attract so many complaints, why are they rejected every day? Are the engineers who design them incompetent, or are there deeper reasons?
"Traffic Flow" (or "traffic flow") is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so in turn, traffic flows tend to show reasonable consistency and can be generically represented mathematically.
To obtain a more accurate representation of traffic flow, the three main variables have been correlated: (1) flow rate, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for planning, designing, and managing road infrastructures.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. The ability to fly allowed them to escape from enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
A large part of insects benefits from the ability to fold their wings along their bodies.
This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small crevices to hide from predators.
Among all the insects that exist today, the only ones that are unable to fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the Sun.
For some, he was right, but many others believed the opposite, namely that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and even the other stars), moved around the Earth.
Which makes sense, because we don't have the feeling that the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth. It carries a volume of water equal to 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with a width that reaches up to six miles in some places.
20% of the total water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. Into it flow the waters of thousands of smaller tributaries.
Stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of their size and technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained enchanted, admiring the monuments of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City consists of about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the smallest population.
The official language of Vatican City for legislation and official communications is Italian.
Italian is also the daily language spoken by most of the people working within the State, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In Vatican City, all citizens are Roman Catholic.
The man began to know the basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper already in antiquity: these elements can be found in nature in native form and can be extracted quite simply with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is composed of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These in fact are more like the four states of matter, that is (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma. However, he also theorized that they transform into new substances, forming what we see.
The alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Obviously, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There can also be alloys composed of minimal quantities of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter and all matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly tiny, so much so that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
After its invention, the pencil therefore proved to be a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to an inferior status and to increasingly less frequent use.
Today everyone writes messages on computer screens and never needs to get close to a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what fate the keyboard will have when something newer arrives.
The principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis for the operation of the fission bomb.
English sentence: Essentially, it's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. Then, by further splitting the core, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no push.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the nearer side and 100 km on the farther side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under mountainous areas.
The maria might be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner. This has made it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Theories about content are focused on finding what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what unites certain people and drives them to want to do what they do, and what are the contextual factors in which they live that push them to do or not do certain things.
Among the most widespread content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, when managers start to lead their former colleagues, two behaviors can emerge. On one hand, there are those who try to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
The manager of this kind finds it complicated to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary actions, evaluate performances, define, and assign responsibilities.
At the other extreme, the manager turns into a completely different person, feeling the need to change the entire team's work and make it their own.
In the end, the leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often generates disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence for virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some small differences.
The members of the virtual team often serve as the point of contact for their next physical group.
They often have greater autonomy compared to members of conventional teams, as meetings can take place according to various time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is defined as the management team to which each member refers, and it is the one that sets the standards for each member.
For what reason should an organization have the willingness to face the long process that leads to building a learning organization? A good reason to implement the concepts of organizational learning can be innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the path of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer's needs.
In order for an organization to be considered innovative, it is necessary for the leaders to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates the continuum theory as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological results have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The research area becomes more focused and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is the foundation of scientists' research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors can affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never observed before.
This offers us a large amount of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite having a strong science fiction connotation, AI represents a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research on AI includes creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of application are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These things have become distinct disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is often used today in economic, medical, engineering, and military fields, as well as being integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are a fundamental part of the educational curriculum. Often, teachers would like to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual tours. Students can see artifacts from museums, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great excuse to share travel experiences and reflections with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website about their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. In fact, their first experiences with blogs are often marked by poor grammar and spelling, but generally the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative judgments, the blog author strives to improve the writing.
Blogs also "force students to become more aware of the moment that surrounds them." The need to feed the public's interest motivates students to be resourceful and engaging (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop student learning well beyond the normal school day.
The correct use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their own position within the writings of others, in addition to outlining their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the picturesque and bilingual capital of Canada, rich in art galleries and museums that tell the past and present of the country.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north, one can admire the natural and unspoiled beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian according to the opinions of foreigners.
The large areas further north are sparsely populated, among them are some almost uninhabited wilderness areas.
If a comparison of the population is made, the result may be surprising for many: in the United States, the number of African American citizens is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
Almost all the smaller islands, known as luxurious beach resorts, are mostly independent nations or associated with France.
In the lands, the Arabs also brought Islam, which embarked on a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape Route, which goes from Europe to India, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama paved the way for European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
For women travelers: it is recommended that everyone declare they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
It is appropriate for women to realize that cultural differences can give rise to what they consider harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Have the firmness to reject men, and do not be afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; known as Anfa, it was a strategically important port used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it under the name of Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city called Daru l-Badya, later named Casablanca by Spanish traders who chose these places for their trading bases.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
In the surroundings of the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagine, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and plenty of trinkets, but all this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying much of the city's streets, especially those in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is advisable to thoroughly research before making any visits outside of Goma, in order to carefully assess the state of ongoing conflicts still present in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, as well as one of the least expensive opportunities to see Africa's mountain gorillas.
It is possible to use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Also as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has ended up becoming a metaphor for an exotic and distant land.
Today Timbuktu is a fallen city, but due to its reputation it remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990, it was included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage sites that are in danger due to the threat posed by desert sands.
In the PBS special by Henry Louis Gates "Wonders of the African World," it was one of the main stops.
With its touch more Arabian than African, the city stands out markedly from the others in the country.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and stretches east along the border with Mozambique, to the north it borders Zimbabwe, and its southern boundary is defined by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 km², the park encompasses 14 different ecozones, each of which sustains a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of the South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, daily conservation and entrance fees are required.
Also, purchasing a Wild Card could be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all the South African national parks.
English sentence: Hong Kong Island, which gives its name to the entire territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings that form the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a shimmering bar chart, even more striking because it is framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island has been concentrated on the reclaimed land of the densely populated northern coast.
This is the place the English colonists chose for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of this land's colonial past, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world. It extends for 80 km (50 mi) from the coast inland into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in Indian territory is named Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only made up of mangrove swamps: they also contain what remains of the majestic jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about one third consists of swampy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wildlife; it is estimated that there are 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses leave from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang) depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses operating between different districts are often full, it would be a good idea to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are served by comfortable and sturdy small Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast means to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque in Brazil to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two pylons are 83 meters high, it is 378 meters long, and it has two lanes each 3.50 meters wide.
Under the bridge, the vertical clearance is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it was opened to traffic only in March 2017.
In September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully operational.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in present-day eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The region of the Chaco was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Great Province of the Indies," was born in the 16th century from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spaniards initiated a period that lasted three centuries, the era of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its identity and indigenous peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best polo teams and the best polo players in the world.
In December, in the polo fields of Las Cañitas, the most important tournament of the year takes place.
Here you can watch minor tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
To receive information about tournaments and purchasing tickets for polo matches, you should contact the Argentine Polo Association.
The Falklands have their official currency, the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value is equivalent to that of the British pound (GBP).
The only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store, offers currency exchange services.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands. In Stanley, you can often also pay with credit cards and US dollars.
It's likely that on the outlying islands they do not accept credit cards, although British and US currencies may be accepted. Check in advance with the owners to decide on an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so change your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months, temperatures over 30°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the sensation of a temperature lower than that indicated by the thermometer.
There are no defined "dry" and "rainy" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year.
Even though many of the park's animals are accustomed to the sight of humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park authorities recommend keeping a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife.
No matter how docile they may seem: bison, moose, deer, bears, practically all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors sustain injuries for not maintaining an adequate distance. It is necessary to give these animals adequate space because they are large, wild, and potentially dangerous animals.
Also keep in mind that smells can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing with you or cooking foods with very strong odors, and try to keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoa islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population is just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port occurred the infamously known naval standoff of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme leader.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is located between two harbors. The most popular ones are spread across three areas.
The beaches facing the Pacific Ocean on the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
It is mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the Waitemata Harbour.
These are family-friendly beaches that are sometimes a bit crowded, surrounded by a wide choice of shops. You can swim safely.
The most well-known local beer is a non-complex, pleasant, and refreshing beer called "Number One." The other local beer is called "Manta."
One can have many French wines, but the Australian and New Zealand ones might better withstand the journey.
The tap water of the place is completely safe to drink, but if one is worried, bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, the 'flat white' coffee originates from a foreign idea. The 'espresso' is the short black coffee, the cappuccino is topped with cream (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is on the same level as the Belgian one. The fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year, many excursions are made to the coral reef, and injuries from one of these causes on the coral reef are rare.
Always seek advice from the authorities, follow the guidelines, and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear from October to April near the beaches and river estuaries north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside of this period, they can only be found occasionally.
Sharks are present but rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and tend to keep their distance.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles consists mainly of river estuaries north of Rockhampton, as they do not actively live in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveler has the peace of mind of having a place to sleep upon reaching their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers or even flight+hotel combined packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents necessary for your destination (e.g., the visa).
However, any changes or requests must be made first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
During some music festivals, most participants decide to camp on site, considering this aspect a crucial part of the experience.
To be close to the center of the action, it is necessary to arrive early and secure a spot near the music.
Remember that once the music is over on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival where music continues late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin location, as crossing the ice causes rather annoying noises for those who are more exposed to it.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time to explore the city. Cruise passengers are granted visa exemption (check conditions).
Generally, casinos do everything they can to maximize the time and money spent by their guests. Usually, there are neither windows nor clocks, and the exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer food, drinks, and exclusive entertainment to keep the guests' spirits high and ensure they stay longer.
In some venues, alcoholic beverages are offered by the house. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and every good gambler knows how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or temperatures near zero.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is reduced, and it is not possible to drive as when one is on clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you may become trapped.
Precipitation and snow gusts, or the formation of ice or condensation on the vehicle's windows, can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost uninterruptedly throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa's biggest tourist attraction and the centerpiece of many visitors' vacations.
In its popular use, the term safari refers to trips carried out on land, particularly in the savannah, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so standard equipment is sufficient to get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes timid, and for this reason, it is better to observe them with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "on-foot safari") is an excursion that can last a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2012, and some of the events will take place in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games. The first Olympics were held in 1964.
If your booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you might find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary among themselves, however, most of the cancellation policies related to the coronavirus, as of the end of March 2020, do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
The cost of most event tickets is expected to be between 2,500 ¥ and 130,000 ¥, while regular tickets will cost approximately 7,000 ¥.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels offer the use of an iron and ironing board, even if they are not available in the room.
If you do not have an iron, or if you do not like to wear ironed socks, you can try with a hairdryer, if you have one available.
Be careful not to expose the fabrics to excessively high temperatures, to avoid shrinkage or, in the worst case, burns.
There are various ways to sanitize water and some of these turn out to be more effective against specific risks.
In some areas it is sufficient to boil the water for one minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of filters is variable, which is why in case of doubt, it is advisable to consider purchasing bottled water in sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travelers may come into contact with animal parasites that are not prevalent in their regions of origin.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritations, or, in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, as well as transmit poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with force are not usually classified as harmful animals.
Duty Free shopping is an opportunity to buy tax and excise duty-free products in certain locations.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions, as it often passes through isolated areas amid vegetation.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, it is advisable to keep your eyes wide open, as steep slopes, narrow roads, and tight curves are prevalent.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than those applied in the preceding and following sections (typically 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Strict adherence to them is extremely important.
Strangely, however, in this area the level of mobile phone service coverage is much higher compared to that present in other parts of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German desserts are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are rather tasty and varied, similar to those of neighboring Austria further south.
Fruit desserts are a timeless classic, from those with apples available year-round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German baked desserts also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The most popular cakes often go very well with a cup of strong coffee.
Anyone who wishes to taste small but flavorful pastries can opt for those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet," depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
In Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used for curries in inland regions; in Southern India and in some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
Considering the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found in the country.
However, when used without further specifications, the term generally refers to foods originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island, Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a series of dishes that are simple to prepare; its predominant flavors come from the use of peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet and are found hanging on both sides of the saddle.
They guarantee greater stability to the rider but may present safety issues due to the possibility that the rider's feet could get stuck in them.
If a jockey is thrown off a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged by the runaway horse. To minimize this risk, there are some safety measures that can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots equipped with a heel and a smooth and rather thin sole.
Subsequently, some saddles, especially English ones, introduced safety bars, which ensure that a leather stirrup detaches from the saddle when the rider pulls it back in case of a fall.
Cochamó Valley: the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, where there is a large number of huge granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks of the summits include breathtaking views. Climbers from every part of the world are continuously charting new routes on its potentially endless walls.
Downhill snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular and involve sliding on the snow using skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts numerous enthusiasts, sometimes even referred to as "ski bums," who dedicate entire vacation periods to skiing in a particular resort.
The principle behind skiing is very ancient: the earliest cave paintings depicting humans skiing date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins at least in the 17th century; in 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Ski touring: the activity is also called off-piste, ski mountaineering, or ski trekking.
It is connected, even though they are not usually included, to ski touring or skimo, which are practiced on steep terrains and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a path similar to a hiking trail.
If the conditions are good, you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than those covered by walking, but only very rarely will you reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but is made up of many independent countries. Normally, to travel through multiple countries, one would need to apply for a visa and go through passport control multiple times.
However, regarding this aspect, the Schengen area functions rather like a single country.
If you stay within this area, it is normally possible to go from one border to another without having to go through passport control again.
In the same way, if you have a Schengen visa, it is not necessary to apply for visas for individual member countries, thus saving time, money, and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes a manufactured item an antique. Some tax agencies consider an object to be so if it is at least 100 years old.
The definition presents geographical differences with respect to the age limit which may be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Craft objects could be defined as antiques, even if more recent than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture on which this trade is based also underpins many other professions.
English sentence: Even over time, not all Sámi have always been involved in large-scale reindeer herding; some lived by fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer primarily as working animals.
Today, many Sámi engage in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the territory of the Sámi.

If a travel advisory is issued for the destination you will be visiting, there could be consequences for your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance.
You might also be interested in the opinions of governments other than your own, but keep in mind that such opinions are aimed at the citizens of those governments.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East might encounter different situations compared to Europeans or Arabs.
Notices simply constitute a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The reported opinions are often superficial, generic, and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Adverse weather conditions" is the general expression used to refer to any dangerous meteorological phenomenon that can cause damage, severe social disruption, or loss of human life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur in every part of the world, and there are different types, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind gusts, hail, above-normal precipitation, and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similar to thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Among the high-intensity regional and seasonal meteorological phenomena are blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are advised to inquire about adverse weather conditions affecting their area, as these could impact travel planning.
Anyone planning to visit a country potentially considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
By searching on the Internet for 'Hostile Environment Course' it is likely to find the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually making use of practical experience.
A course normally lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, as well as many first aid training activities and sometimes weapons.
Books and magazines about survival in nature are widespread, while there are few publications that deal with war zones.
Travelers who are scheduled for gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documents for the return journey.
The intention of governments to issue passports without indications regarding sex (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
Equally variable is the willingness of foreign governments to accept such documents.
Even the inspections at security checks have become much more thorough in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to pass through controls without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
Rip currents are formed by the backflow of waves breaking on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formations.
Considering the underwater topology, the rip current concentrates in some deeper sections where a strong current towards the open sea can form.
Most deaths occur because of exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which can prove impossible.
As soon as you leave the current, swimming back will be no more difficult than usual.
Try to find an area where you aren't at risk of being trapped again, or consider waiting for rescue, depending on your abilities and whether you have been spotted.
Reverse culture shock manifests in a shorter time compared to culture shock (as there is a shorter "honeymoon" phase), lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Travelers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes have difficulty readjusting to the culture of their home country.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the customs of your original culture.
In the first experience abroad, it is likely to have met patient and understanding people, aware of the fact that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not imagine that patience and awareness were necessary even for those returning to their homeland.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is the most interesting thing in the area for children.
Before the start of the show, it will be possible to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Normally, you always hear the noise caused by tourists and vendors. The display of sounds and lights is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx becomes the backdrop and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by various countries, the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the highest number of bases, of which sixteen were active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands are Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the caldera of a still-active volcano filled with water gives rise to a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region located south of the peninsula and faces the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula blend into the plateau, only to reemerge and form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360 km chain split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Range, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4,892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a mobile phone, because to make a call you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite.
The service is often used by recreational vessels, including pleasure boats, as well as by missions that require remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information regarding the connection to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options among those planning to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly common among recent graduates, as they can take a year off before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year can actually increase the chances of resuming higher education upon returning to one's home country.
Usually, enrollment in these educational programs requires the payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love sailing. In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" there are also thousands of islands, within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht for archipelagos and lakes.
Even though the coastal archipelagos and the larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime of Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This also happens in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but in general, it is a rather unusual fact (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
A large part of the various Baltic cruises includes a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that it is possible to visit the historic town for two whole days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
For the landing on the ground, a separate visa will not be necessary (starting from 2009) when using the onboard excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises to Berlin, Germany. As can be seen from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea; moreover, the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can scare people of all ages and conditions, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not dissimilar to the fears and personal aversions that many people exhibit towards other things.
For certain people, understanding a bit about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can prove useful in overcoming a fear based on the unknown or on not having control.
Couriers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Timing is often very important in the case of business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some routes, the larger companies use their own planes, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies, problems arose.
On some routes, air shipments would have taken days for unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to get it there faster would be to send it as checked luggage. And that's where you come in, since airline regulations don't allow sending luggage without a passenger.
To fly in first class or business class, the most obvious way is to shell out a hefty sum for the privilege (or, even better, convince your company to do it).
However, the cost to pay is high: you can expect to fork out up to four times the normal economy fare for Business trips and up to eleven times the fare for those in first class!
In general, on direct flights from A to B, it's not even worth looking for discounts on first class or business class seats.
Airlines know well that there is a category of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably at their destination, and consequently apply certain fares.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău and the local language is Romanian. However, Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that in the past was the scene of an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, equipped with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member countries.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two areas of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is Christian Orthodox.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million inhabitants; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna develops around a vast bay, is surrounded by mountains, and currently constitutes a modern, evolved, and active commercial center.
Although in the city there is an atmosphere more similar to that of Mediterranean Europe than to that of traditional Turkey, the wide avenues, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers are dotted with characteristic red tile roofs, the 18th-century market, and ancient mosques and churches.

In the churchyard, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
Half an hour is enough to walk around the enchanting village.
To the north lies the romantic and enchanting city of Sintra, easily accessible. It became famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant account of its splendors written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 bus line regularly connects to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Always to the north, visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (a place of worship), a site of Marian apparitions famous worldwide.
Remember that the site you are visiting is fundamentally a mass grave, and it has an almost incalculable significance for a significant part of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women who survived these places, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or worked to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Avoid jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Avoid defacing these places by marking or painting graffiti on the structures.
In the city of Barcelona, the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority are able to understand it; Spanish is known by practically everyone.
However, most of the signs are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transport and other services.
In the subway, regular announcements are only in Catalan. Any unscheduled service disruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
Parisians are known for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Even though it often involves just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to enjoy yourself in Paris remains to behave at your best, interacting like a "bien élevé" (well-mannered) person. This will certainly make getting around easier.
The rough exterior appearance of Parisians will quickly vanish if you display some basic good manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in forests, predominantly of beech, spruce, and fir trees, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a multiplicity of microclimates, soils, and different altitude levels, it offers a great variety of plant communities.
The area also hosts a very wide variety of animal species and birds.
In these places live rare species such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the capercaillie, alongside several other more widespread animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and to cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide shawls for women who arrive unprepared, but if you already have one, especially in bright colors, you will earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long pants down to below the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance; however, the garments are not washed after each user, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. For the men, one size fits all!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
The Pa amb Oli is a simple, popular dinner, typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato, and all available toppings, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, in addition to the pronoun "Sie" used for the formal form which stands for "Lei," always start with a capital letter, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This represents an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or an adjective is used in a nominalized form makes writing rather complex.
The pronunciation of Italian is relatively simple since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, since their pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows.
Also make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: caro means beloved, while carro means carriage.
The Persian language has a relatively simple and often regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could greatly help you with Persian grammar and in understanding sentences.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with a minimal knowledge of the Spanish language might quickly conclude that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore does not need to be studied separately.
Nowadays, premodern observatories are usually obsolete and serve as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution during their heyday was not a problem like it is today, they are usually located in cities or campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge structures in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
The admiration of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where the blooming of plum trees was preferred.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor only for himself and for other members of the aristocracy close to the imperial court.
Plants thrive when they are in their natural habitat, so resist the temptation to take even "just" one specimen.
If you visit an Italian garden, even picking some plant specimens will result in your removal from the place, without discussion.
In general, Singapore is a very safe city and easy to get around; you can buy practically anything once you arrive.
However, being in the "high tropics," only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with the heat (always) and the strong sun (more rarely, when the sky is clear).

Christmas represents one of the most important holidays of Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
A large part of the traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
A tradition involves spending Easter night staying awake in an outdoor location to admire the sunrise.
Naturally, there are Christian theological explanations underlying this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In the more traditional Churches, an Easter vigil is frequently held on the night of Saturday of the Easter weekend, with congregations often starting the ceremony at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came by swimming, flying, or floating.
Since the distance from the continent was considerable, the mammals could not make the journey. This resulted in the giant tortoise becoming the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs, and cats were introduced to the Galapagos after the arrival of humans.
If you visit the territories of the Arctic or the Antarctic during winter, it will be possible to experience the polar night, when the sun stays below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the possibility to witness the Northern Lights because the sky remains dark almost all day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem, and you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the work culture is more hierarchical and formal compared to what Westerners tend to be accustomed to.
Office attire normally consists of a suit and tie or a tailored suit, and colleagues are addressed by their surname or professional title.
The harmony of the workplace is of crucial importance, as it emphasizes the commitment of the group rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often need to receive approval from their superiors regarding every decision, and they are expected to adhere to instructions without asking questions.
