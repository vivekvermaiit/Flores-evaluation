This not only confirms the fact that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, but it provides us with details that fossils generally cannot give, such as their colors and their three-dimensional arrangements.
The scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown on top with a straw-colored or carotenoid lower part.
The discovery also provides a first look at the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur's feathers do not have a very developed structure, called a rachis, but instead have other feather features—barbs and barbules—the researchers deduced that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not that of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the fragment shows adult plumage and not chick fluff.
A car that exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than twenty other people.

They found that the Sun operated according to the same basic principles as the other stars: It was discovered that the activity of all the stars in the system was conditioned by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
The brightness and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is linked to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number is, the less active the star is in relation to magnetic reversals.

The work done was essentially theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal force between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Exactly as the moon exerts an attraction on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way similarly exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located in a kind of halo around the galaxy and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
During an interview, he stated that the new variant was "extremely concerning and alarming because of the very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have contracted the virus at the hospital, thinks Dr. Moll, and at least two of them were hospital healthcare workers.
Over the course of a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the whole group of people with tuberculosis still seems low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 infected people at any given time in South Africa.

The infrared images show that the temperature variations from night to day indicate the probable presence of caves.
They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as constant as in the large caves of the Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep pits in the ground," said Glen Cushing, of the astrogeology team at the American Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, place a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the candidate they have chosen into an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the list of voters.
The French electoral law rather strictly codifies the procedures.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that no envelope was present at the start of the voting and that no envelope was added except those from duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness the procedure. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under heavy supervision, following specific procedures.

Uka's weapon failed just as he was aiming at the head of a fifth person. Schneider has persistent pain, blindness in one eye, a missing section of the skull, and a face reconstructed from titanium.
Schneider testified via videolink from a USAF base in his home country.
After Wednesday's competition, Carpanedo participated in two individual races of the championships.
His first was the slalom, where he got a Did Not Finish in his first race. 36 out of 116 competitors got the same result in that race.
In her other race, the giant slalom, she finished in tenth position in the women's group with a combined race time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Loesch who finished in first place and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Hungary's Gyöngyi Dani who finished in ninth place.
Four female skiers from the women's group failed to finish their races, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify in the race.
The police of Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The deputy inspector general D K Arya stated, "We have arrested five people who assaulted the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Even though three people were inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has appeared at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with the murder of her son.
She is held pending her indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony may be compromised by the fact that her image has been widely published.
It is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice operates differently, and the courts have seen the publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes, "journalists truly seem to be walking a dangerous line if they publish photos etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which generally handles judicial proceedings, has informed journalists that no additional comment will be made at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the dispute over the borders, which Palestine wants to be based on those before the Middle East War of 1967.
Other topics that would have been addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to allow such a presence for only five years.
The shooters of the additional trial for controlling harmful populations had to be closely monitored by the guards, as the trial was supervised and its effectiveness assessed.
Within the framework of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers have been recruited for the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the interim director of conservation and heritage of the park with the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation were given complete safety instructions and training.
Martelly was sworn in before a new provisional electoral council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures that will lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating defective iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Minister of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) of Japan said he had been informed of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by describing the postponement of Apple's report as "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 in the morning local time (9:19 in the evening GMT on Friday).
The emergency management office of the Northern Marianas declared that no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six of them have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman who needed to go to the restroom. Mendoza was dismayed.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He did obstetrician training and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began studying premature labor during his free time.
Her research demonstrated that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the fetal lung of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight 'black boxes' on Wednesday.
The wrestler colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed on the night of the two moons. She is truly unique just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as troubled as I was... maybe even more... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Of the 1400 people who were surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, those who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those in the survey share this point of view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent of them believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100 and 200 meters freestyle categories and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition has been called into question.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome his pain since they were banned for the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number so far on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using computer equipment and software from the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may possibly have been the source of water delivery to Earth together with organic material that can form proteins and sustain life.
The scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, particularly how Earth was formed, since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his term as governor at the beginning of the year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political blah blah and stupidity."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that according to the FAA would allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to determine the position of an aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is provided and surface trains will not stop at Wembley; parking and park-and-ride facilities are unavailable on the ground.
The fear of lack of transport raised the possibility that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species on the equatorial islands of the Galápagos.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new bird species had evolved in just two generations, even though this process was thought to take longer, due to the reproduction between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked to create all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into very small forms.
It can be drawn to become a thin thread, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very fine, and embedded into another metal. It can be made so fine that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
It is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The juice of cabbages changes color depending on the degree of acidity or alkalinity (basicity) of the chemical product.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical product tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed from them (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix both dry powders together and then, with clean and moist hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The humidity on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will give you a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had bathrooms with water in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of toilet systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were together in mixed company.
As soon as you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back to Earth almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A giant rocket more than 100 feet tall is needed to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The most important thing the wheel has done for us is to provide us with a much easier and faster means of transportation.
The train, the car, and many other means of transport have brought us.
Beneath them are medium-sized felines that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including roaming domestic cats) that eat the much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the little cape, a special task that each cat has and that prevents them from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social felines, living in large groups called prides.
The groups of lions are composed of one to three adult males from the same family, together with as many as thirty females and cubs.
The females are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
The groups of lions act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other felines) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-trained athlete, the tiger can climb (although not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-throated roar of the lion, but more like a phrase of reborn and howled words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) by their smell, sniffing where they have passed on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision and also move very stealthily. The ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with the environment.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population they came from (such as across a mountain range or a river, or if they move towards a new island in such a way that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and rivals, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it starts to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, both populations will appear so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
The plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
The plants draw their nourishment from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants and we make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the most important predator of its time, and therefore feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Her long jaws were lined with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of her mouth, which meant that there was no way out for anything that crossed her path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a strong tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it is possible that it was even a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex would not have stood a chance against it.
Even if most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual celebratory elements, which included boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they would recline on their sides while eating their meals.
The meals of the ancient Romans could not have included foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had neither corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cacao, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple that was considered as the house of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open temple court and then an inner sanctuary where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes there were special pyramidal towers, called ziggurats, built to be a part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not that important.
Most of the life of the Jewish family took place outdoors.
The women were cooking in the courtyard; the shops were merely open stalls opening onto the street. The stone was used to build the houses.
There were no significant forests in the land of Canaan, and thus wood was extremely expensive there.
Greenland was sparsely colonized. It is recounted in the Norse sagas that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland because of a murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But beyond its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Even if each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences among the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the film National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, it is not true. Even if there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text appears at the bottom of the document, on the back.
Even though no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its life, this large document and parchment (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be kept.
And so, it is probable that the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings, and the subsequent battles, had liberated the north of France, but the south was not free yet.
It was governed by the French from "Vichy". They were French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders rather than fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the south of France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the American and French forces had liberated the south of France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, a relative of the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning town or city-state, and which also in a certain way defines the dimension of society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge over various generations, a persistent cultural weight, and equitable diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as distinct civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states for the first time formed a weak central government—which had Congress as its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, which were often uncooperative, to implement all its decisions.
English sentence: Nor did he have any authority to override tax laws and tariffs between the states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, together with the Germany national football team, is the second team that has been the most successful in the entire world and were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), which makes Japan the seventh largest island country in the world.
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often called, from a geographic point of view, an "archipelago."
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the production practices of indigenous grains and employing Chinese workers to work in their rice paddies and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal regions of the west and north of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, with which it cedes sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governs the island until 1945.
The Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings around the complex have been rebuilt in order to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
Around 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for still image photography in the entire world is 35mm, which was the dominant film format at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, in a somewhat surprising way, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often overused and ridiculed, is a simple guide that creates dynamism while also preserving a measure of order within an image.
He claims that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During that period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was subjected to a meticulous examination.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion had bound together the European states despite the differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone from the king to the peasant.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds are specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and that concentration of power and money made many people wonder if this principle was being respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain launched a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated the generally accepted international law codified by various international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mined the international waters to prevent all vessels from entering entire sections of the ocean, causing danger even to neutral vessels.
Since there was a limited response to that tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, the nations desired to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in the city of New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of describing different periods of time; each stage of China or each family that was in power represented a distinct dynasty.
There was also between each dynasty an unstable period of divided provinces. The most well-known of those periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During those periods, a fierce war took place among many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying in the fight to sit on the highest throne in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a change from absolutism to republicanism, to nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
Also, after the Revolution, the professions were open to all male candidates, which allowed the most ambitious and brilliant to succeed.
It is the same for the military because instead of having army rankings based on class, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people from repressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
The English translation is: Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (the light) for contemplation.
The very cave, which survived time, gives a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Perched on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find, even if one knew it existed. Once inside the cave, it is total isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the clear and beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. Not much of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that is still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians during the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures constructed to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, various temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "high arc" mark looks like a V and the "low arc" mark looks like a bracket or a square missing its bottom.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A high bow generally produces a softer sound, while a low bow is stronger and more assertive.
You should feel free to make your own marks with a pencil, but remember that the printed marks are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were sent back from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789, by a crowd of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and yelled threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to have the windows of their carriage fully open.
At one moment a member of the mob shook the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were obliged to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to repay a large part of the expenses and the interests of the bonds issued in the name of the Filipino government through Wall Street banks.
Certainly, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipinos would constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period during which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the beginning of the Middle Ages and followed by the end of the Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be stated that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a network of national roads is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, and therefore new methods of production are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The mass possession of cars also leads to a greater incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new care techniques to repair bodily damages.
Romanticism had an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time the customs and culture linked to that geography emerged, and those, being in harmony with the place in society, were better than the laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Their status declined during the 12th century mainly because the Crusaders had returned bearing gifts such as silks and spices that were of greater value than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at that moment that the transfer of the title of fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.
The Gothic style reached its peak during the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of the slow communication channels, styles in the west could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major advancements of that era was that as a result of the crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is an agriculture that is carried out for the production of sufficient food to just meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, using seeds kept native to the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, many peasants were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in several developing nations.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar ideas who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as being distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which can include fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most frequent methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from the unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, accident, or deliberate mistreatment, were not socialized by adults during their formative years.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some wild children have been confined by people (usually the parents themselves); in some cases, this abandonment of children was due to the parents' rejection of a severe intellectual or physical deficiency of a child.
It is possible that the wild children had suffered violence or severe trauma during their childhood before being abandoned or having run away.
Some others are supposedly raised by animals; it is said that some lived in the wild alone.
When completely raised by non-human animals, the wild child exhibits behaviors (within their physical limits) almost completely similar to those of the particular adopting animal, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
Even though project-based learning should be the easiest and most interesting learning, the stage goes a step further.
The Empont is not a learning method but rather a support that provides assistance to individuals experiencing a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Stages can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of stage but it is also the case with the trombone man from Microsoft Office.
Virtual Bridges are internalized within the software and function to question, prompt, and explain procedures that may have been too complex for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of important reasons ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they do.
We perceive the Foster Care system as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster family system is supposed to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The host families are expected to provide all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and gratifications.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are suggested as important motivations for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to detect if a person is lying by interpreting their microexpressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who were unable to understand a speech due to brain damage were nonetheless capable of accurately assessing sincerity.
It suggests moreover that such capacities for interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation in both directions between both pools in each generation.
In the savanna, it is hard for a primate with a digestive system like humans to meet its amino acid needs from the resources available in plants.
Moreover, not doing so has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
On the other hand, animal foods (ants, grubs, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide proteins in large quantities that contain all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our very ancestors resolved their "protein problem" in a certain way similarly to how chimpanzees do it in the savannah today.
The interruption of sleep is the process that consists of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a little later (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively discreet alarm clock to bring you toward consciousness without waking you completely.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, which will require you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on the biorhythm involve drinking plenty of liquids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleeping, which forces you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in the body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha but was spread through the Mahayana path of love and by powerful Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is quite simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. From the end of the war, the confrontations of systems, processes, and culture led to a rupture between these countries.
After two years since the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and would be fought for real, with proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already shattered, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts following the invasion of the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional role of navies has been to ensure that your country maintains its ability to move its people and goods, while simultaneously interfering with the enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples of this is the campaign in the North Atlantic during the Second World War. The Americans were trying to move men and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which mainly used U-boats, was trying to stop this movement.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain as it had done with the rest of Europe.
The goats were apparently first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
The ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often overseen by goat herders who were frequently children or adolescents, similar to the more commonly known shepherds. These pastoral methods are still used today.
The rail tracks for horse-drawn carriages were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though the railroads consisted simply of parallel wooden posts, they allowed the horses that pulled to reach higher speeds and to haul heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of that time.
The sleepers were introduced quite early to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they had a strip of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first entirely iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of transport was walking; humans began to walk upright two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more respectfully towards the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
It is only like a symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and we should deactivate them.
It is quite evident that the world has changed greatly because of the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and the problems have become larger due to overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to the printing office of John Dunlap.
During the whole night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 sheets of Dunlap that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe today that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are many traits of birds that still resemble those of dinosaurs.
Year of feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, for example 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, if we use computer jargon.
It is possible that internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning might be the presence of an open medication container or toxic household chemicals.
You need to check the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Bedbugs and assassin bugs are both nidicolous, adapted to live in a nest or the dwelling of their host.
Across the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple can decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the interest of their child, to raise a baby.
Those couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
However, it is not only that; experimentation and an experience is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations that also guide scientific research.
The naturalists and the philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's opinions were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
Since the knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been documented in the majority of living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a free-running cycle period even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments by labeling either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit, photograph, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small countryside towns in cars to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose work destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, each person is in one way or another connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
Science indicates that this massive carbon economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Nearly everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why don't they work properly on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental happening?
The flow of traffic is the study of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and the interactions they create with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult since driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have a certain consistency and can be represented mathematically in an approximate manner.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operations of road facilities.
The insects were the first animals to take flight. Their ability to fly helped them escape from their enemies more easily and find food and partners more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right but many others believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other celestial bodies).
That seems sensible, because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest in the world. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
Amazonas is also the widest river in the world, sometimes six kilometers wide.
A 20 percent of the water flowing from the planet's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Even though the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were in awe of the monuments of their predecessors, which were more than a thousand years older.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the entire world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
The Italian language is also the everyday language for most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known the basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since Antiquity, as they can all be found in nature in their native forms and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made from a mixture of one or more of the four elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, even though it was also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. You must not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
It might also contain alloys that have small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit inside the period at the end of this sentence.
And so, the pencil was a good friend for many people when it appeared.
It is sad, but with the advent of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lesser status and uses.
People now write messages on computers or on computer screens, without ever having to approach a typewriter.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer arrives.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to bring together a nucleus and force protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. Splitting the nucleus again then releases a part of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with a small push or even less.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the opposite side.
It's deeper under the sea and denser beneath the highlands.
It can have more seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Theories of content focus on what people choose or what interests them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized from the time they matured into adulthood.
These theories examine what there is about certain people that makes them want to do the things they do and what aspects in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when managers start to lead their former colleagues. One extreme of the spectrum is to try to remain "one of the guys" (or the women).
This type of manager has difficulties making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, another turned into a hard-to-recognize individual who feels that he or she must change everything the team has done and claim it as their own.
Ultimately, the leader is the ultimate responsible for the success and the failure of his team.
This behavior often results in rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members since their teams can meet according to variable time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team establishes the norms for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the laborious process of building a learning organization? Innovation is one of the goals when implementing organizational learning concepts.
When all available resources are effectively utilized across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the procedure of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the client's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to research on cognition. Therefore, it limits the research area and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior validates the researchers' findings.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain injury, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind.
Even though artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction connotation, AI is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer inquiries and diagnostics, as well as handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
Such matters have come from separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to the real problems of everyday life.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, since it has been built into various computer applications and home video games.
Field trips are an important part of all classes. Quite often a teacher would like to take their students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual tours. Students can look at artifacts from a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while seated with their class.
Sharing an outing virtually on the terrain is also an excellent way to plan an excursion and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year the website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often start their blogging experience with neglected grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Given that students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to make significant efforts to improve their writings and avoid criticism.
At the same time, blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to nurture public interest inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Using a blog is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond traditional school days.
The proper use of blogs "can encourage students to become more analytical and critical; through active responses to online material, students can define their positions in the context of others' writings as well as highlight their own perspectives on particular topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the pleasant bilingual capital of Canada and features a fine array of art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
The Niagara Falls are located much further south and the north is the region of the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more enhance Ontario in what is regarded as the quintessence of the Canadian by outsiders.
The larger areas further north are rather sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness regions.
To make a population comparison that surprises many people: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent on its own in terms of wild animals.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France, and known as luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the territories, and it established itself significantly in Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence and European colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the route from the Cape of Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their true marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what they might consider as harassment and it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
You must be firm when rejecting men, and do not be afraid to defend your territory (cultural differences or not, that is not normal!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1775.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and Spanish merchants who had established trade bases there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather items, hookahs, and a whole range of knick-knacks, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near the Rwandan border.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, particularly the city center.
Even though Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside of Goma should be examined to understand the state of ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
The town is also the base for ascending Mount Nyiragongo, along with some of the least expensive mountain gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
It is possible to use a boda-boda (a motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, even if its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of the desert sands.
It was one of the major stages during the special broadcast Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates on PBS.
The city is in stark contrast with the rest of the towns in the country because it has a more Arabic than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River is the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting various wild animals.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the emblematic brand of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
As with all the national parks in South Africa, preservation and entry fees must be paid daily for the park.
It can also be advantageous for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which provides entry to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all the national parks of South Africa.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider as their main interest.
The display of buildings that make Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a brilliant bar graph, made apparent by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, you need to leave the island and head towards the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
The vast majority of urban development on the island of Hong Kong is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonizers took as if it were theirs, and therefore if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, it's a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland from the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only mangrove swamps however — they include some of the last remaining patches of the mighty jungles that in the past covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about a third is covered with water or marshes.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, particularly those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Its construction was completed in August 2011, but it wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017 when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as seminomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The region of Chaco was the home of other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
During the 16th century, Paraguay, which was formerly known as "the Giant Province of the Indies," emerged as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the native indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began the period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain a large part of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the entire world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
To get news about tournaments and find out where to buy tickets for polo matches, visit Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to a British pound (GBP).
You can change money at the only bank in the islands which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West shop.
The British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere on the islands, and inside Stanley credit cards and American dollars are also often accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, although British and American currency may be taken; check with the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical regions; during the summer months, temperatures above 30°C are frequent.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost the same throughout the year.
Even though many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is nevertheless wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, it is necessary to stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
It's not important if they seem docile, the bison, the elk, the moose, the bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not maintain an adequate distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Moreover, you need to be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking smelly foods and keep a clean camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded during the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the fight for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the town resulted in the death of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is situated between two harbors. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the district of North Harbour) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch to Long Bay in the north and to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches where you can swim safely, and most have shaded areas provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the luxurious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
They are family-friendly beaches sometimes very crowded that have a good range of shops lined along the coast. Swimming there is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One', it is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to have, but the wines from New Zealand and Australia might travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you have any concerns.
For Australians, the concept of 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A short black coffee is an 'espresso', the cappuccino comes with plenty of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reefs are made all year round, and accidents due to some of these causes on the reefs are rare.
However, you need to follow the advice of the authorities, respect all the signs, and pay close attention to the safety warnings.
The box jellyfish appear near the beaches and near the river estuaries from October to April to the north of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside of those times.
Sharks really exist, however they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their main habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives peace of mind to the traveler who will have a place to sleep as soon as they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, and it may also be possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping grounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to and from the airport, or even some packages that combine flights with the hotel.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the proposal or to obtain other documents for your destination (for example, the visa).
Any kind of modification or request should therefore be notified through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
In some festivals, the majority of music festival participants decide to camp on-site, and most participants consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will need to get up early to secure a campsite near the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages may have ended, there might be sections of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the Northern Baltic in winter, you need to check the cabin location because crossing the ice causes quite a terrifying noise for the most sensitive people.
The cruises to Saint Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (check the conditions).
Casinos typically make several efforts to maximize the time and money spent by clients. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and the exits can be hard to find.
They usually have special foods and drinks and entertainment offerings to keep customers in a good mood and keep them on the spot.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages on-site. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know it's important to stay sober.
Those who are about to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During the blizzards, enough snow to immobilize you can fall in very little time.
Visibility can also be reduced by falling snow or snow carried by the wind, by condensation, or by ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, the conditions under ice and snow are normal in many countries, and traffic flows almost uninterruptedly throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the most important tourist attraction in Africa and are the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular use refers to overland trips to observe the magnificent African wildlife, particularly the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach the cars and standard equipment will allow them to be observed well.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk," "safari excursion," or "footing") involves walking, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, after hosting the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you might be in a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets for the competitions are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available to be borrowed, even if they are not present in the room.
If an iron is not available or if you do not feel like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
You must be careful not to let the fabric become too hot (which can cause shrinking, or in extreme cases, severe burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, in others several minutes are necessary.
The filters vary in effectiveness, and in case of doubt, you should then consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers can encounter harmless animals with which they are not familiar in their regions of origin.
Innocuous animals can spoil food, cause irritations or, in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Even infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, do not fall into the category of harmful things.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to buy products exempt from taxes and special fees in certain places.
Travelers heading towards countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, particularly on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, frequently passing through isolated backwoods areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep a calm mind: steep slopes, narrow roads, and tight turns prevail.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the preceding and following sections — frequently from 35 to 40 miles per hour (56 to 64 km/h) — and strict adherence to them is even more important than otherwise.
Curiously, however, the mobile phone service is much stronger here than in many other parts of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are very good, and in Bavaria, they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
The fruits in the bakery are common, with baked apples in cakes all year round, and cherries and plums that make their appearance during the summer.
Many baked German products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes are particularly well paired with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try what, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on aromatic herbs and spices, accompanied by either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the proportion of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, it is coconut milk that is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian gastronomy is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the nation.
But, when used without any other qualifiers, the term tends to mean the food that is originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, with the predominant flavors favored by the Javanese being peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (particularly coconut palm sugar), and a variety of aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on each side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider but can create safety concerns because the rider's feet might get caught.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a good number of safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a soft, fairly narrow sole.
Subsequently, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup leather to come off the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley - The premier climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and domes.
The peaks include impressive views from the summits. Climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes among its infinite potential of walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding on a snowy terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has numerous enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations centered around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very ancient — paintings in caves depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century and, in 1861, the first recreational skiing club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Going on ski hikes: this activity is also called backcountry skiing, touring skiing, or ski touring.
It's a relative, but usually does not understand alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter done on steep terrain and requiring much more rigid skis and boots.
You need to think of the ski itinerary as a similar hiking itinerary.
Under good conditions, you might travel relatively greater distances than by walking – but only very rarely will you reach cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy pack on groomed tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling across multiple countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport controls multiple times.
The Schengen Area, however, functions to a certain extent like a country in this case.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross the borders without going through passport control points again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen member countries separately, and thus you save time, money, and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition on which manufactured objects are antiques. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
This definition is subject to geographical variations, as the age limit could be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Artisanal products could be defined as ancient, even though they are more recent than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important source of resources for the Sami, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many who have other professions.
And even traditionally, not all Sami people have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but have lived by fishing, hunting, and other similar activities, mainly keeping reindeer as draft animals.
Today many Sámi work in modern businesses. Tourism is an important income in Sápmi, the Sami country.
Even though it is commonly used, particularly among non-Roma, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because of its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to travel advisories, your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also wish to consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Travel advice is simply a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Inclement weather is the generic term for all kinds of meteorological phenomena that have the potential to cause damage, serious social disruptions, or the loss of human lives.
Inclement weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and forest fires are forms and effects of inclement weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal violent meteorological phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of all the severe weather risks that might affect their area as it could impact all their travel plans.
Those who plan to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
An Internet search for 'course for hostile environment' will probably provide the address of a local company.
A course should normally cover all the subjects discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will usually last between 2 to 5 days and will include role-playing games, many first aid elements, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines that deal with survival in wild regions are common, but publications that deal with war zones are scarce.
Travelers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they carry valid documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with the gender not specified (X) or to update documents to match a desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is simply variable everywhere.
The security checkpoint searches also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Pre-operative transgender individuals should not expect to go through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
The rip currents are the backflow of the waves that detach from the beach, often to a reef or something nearby.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deep sections, and a rapid current towards the deep waters can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of the fatigue from trying to swim to the shore against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, getting back to swimming is no more difficult than usual.
Try to head somewhere where you won't be caught again or, depending on your abilities and if you have been noticed, you might want to wait for help.
The return shock comes sooner than the culture shock (there is less than a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to their new culture sometimes have particularly difficult moments readjusting to their culture of origin.
When you come back home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits of your original culture.
When you went abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
It is possible that people do not anticipate that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and you can see them in silence before the start of the show.
Usually, you constantly hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of sounds and lights is simply like a book of tales.
The Sphinx serves as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by various nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the village of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, and then re-emerge to form the Ellsworth Mountains range, divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which peaks at 4892 m at Mount Vinson.
In remote areas without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that need data and voices.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about the connection to this service.
A more popular option for those planning to take a sabbatical year is to travel to learn.
It is something particularly popular for those who finish school, as it allows them to take a gap year before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in studies abroad during a gap year can actually improve your chances of entering higher education once you return to your home country.
There will generally be tuition fees to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and the lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Even though the coastal archipelagos and the larger lakes are indeed quite large for all kinds of yachts, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This coincides with Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the number is one in forty).
Most of the different Baltic Cruises include a long stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days and return to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only go ashore as part of the ship's excursions you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin, in Germany, in the brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have not flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's not something we should be ashamed of: it's no different from the fears and personal aversions to other things that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how a plane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on being unable to control anything.
Courier companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Often, time is very important for business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the major companies have their own planes, but for other routes and the smaller firms, there was a problem.
If they had sent the items by air freight, on some routes, it is possible it could have taken days to go through unloading stages and customs.
The only way to make it go faster was to send it as luggage in the hold. Airline regulations will not allow luggage to be sent without a passenger, which is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to shell out a good amount of money for this privilege (or, even better, have your company do it for you).
However, it's not cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay at least four times the normal price in economy class for business class and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no point in looking for discounts on business class or first-class seats on direct flights from point A to B.
The airline companies know well that there is a certain core group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of dollars for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and are charged accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language there is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, that conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the east of Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any of the UN member countries.
Economic ties have been reestablished between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The most important religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the second-largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
Before, the ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and busy commercial operations center, situated around a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the buildings with glass facades, and the modern shopping centers are interspersed with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and the ancient mosques and churches, even if the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighboring island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting sculptures of marble doves on some tombs.
It is worth a half-hour walk in this strange village.
To the north and easily accessible is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which was made famous to foreigners after an enthusiastic account of its splendors was documented by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, you should also visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (a holy place), a site of world-famous Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are visiting primarily a place of mass graves and also a site that holds almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to their deaths here, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make any jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not damage the site by writing or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, a vast majority understand it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are indicated only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have the reputation of being self-centered, discourteous, and arrogant.
Even if it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is still to demonstrate your best behavior, by acting like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make it considerably easier for you to get along.
The abrupt exteriors of Parisians will quickly evaporate if you demonstrate a few basic courtesies.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
To a notably wide variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils, and varying altitude levels.
The area also hosts an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
A rare fauna can be found such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the wild peacock, as well as many other more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are asked to wear skirts that cover the knees and to have their shoulders covered as well.
Most monasteries provide shawls to women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, particularly one with bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
In the same way, men were asked to wear pants that covered the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the reserve at the entrance, but that outfit is not washed after each user, so you may feel uncomfortable wearing those gowns. One size fits all men!
The Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (generally pork), and uses olive oil everywhere.
A simple popular dinner, especially during the summer, is pa amb oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and all kinds of available accompaniments like cheese, tuna, etc.
All names, along with the word Sie for you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
Without a doubt, it makes reading easier, even if the writing is somewhat complicated due to the need to figure out whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantivized form.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most of the words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also, make sure to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means car, while carro means cart.
Persian has a relatively easy and generally regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introduction to grammar would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand the sentences.
It's useless to say that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it does not need to be studied separately.
Premodern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution at its peak was not the type of problem it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to reach than those that were built during the modern era.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
To see the blooming of cherry trees, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where the plum blossoms were the chosen flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were hosted by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants have a better appearance when they are in a natural environment, so you must resist the temptation to pick "just one" specimen.
If you visit a garden arranged in a formal way, picking some "specimens" will also get you thrown out, without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to go and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything as soon as you get there.
But since it is located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with both the heat (continuously) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, though more rarely).
There are also some buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
You need to check that the bus you plan to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
The inland waterways can be a good basis for a vacation.
For example, visit the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or go on a cruise to interesting sites on the Danube or go boating on the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular walks and cycle paths.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
More than one of the traditions surrounding the festivities has also been adopted by non-believers in both Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake at some exposed point to see the sunrise.
There are certainly Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on the night of Saturday during the Easter weekend, with congregations often beginning the celebration right at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that arrived first on the islands did so either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, the mammals were unable to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the main grazing animal of the Galápagos.
Since the arrival of humans to the Galápagos, many mammals have been introduced there, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, since the sky will be dark more or less continually.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are accustomed to.
The customs are standard work attire and colleagues address each other by their last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing group effort rather than praising individual performances.
Workers often have to obtain approval from their superiors for all the decisions they make, and are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without any questioning.
