This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely popular, but also provides details that fossils generally do not provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the feathers of this animal were chestnut-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The find also provides an opportunity to delve into the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called rachis, but possess other feather characteristics — barbs and hooks — the researchers conclude that the rachis is likely a later evolutionary development compared to the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used during flight, but rather for thermoregulation or display. According to the researchers, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage rather than chick down.
Researchers suggest that although this might be the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage of an adult, not the down of a young individual.

"They are cooler than the adjacent surface during the day and warmer at night."
"Their thermal state is not as stable as that of the large caves on Earth, which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
Traditionally in France, voting is low-tech: voters isolate themselves in a booth, mark their chosen candidate on a pre-printed piece of paper, and place it in an envelope.
Once the officials verify the identity of the voter, he or she places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral roll.
The French electoral law quite strictly defines the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the beginning of the voting and that no envelopes are being cast other than those of duly registered and eligible voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

At the next competition, the Giant Slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting group with a combined running time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Lösch, who finished first, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who finished in ninth place.
Four women from the sit-ski group did not finish their rounds, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the competition.
The police in Madhya Pradesh have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Chief Inspector D. K. Arya stated that they have arrested the five men who raped the Swiss woman and have returned her mobile phone and laptop.
Grandmother Kanjhar, Butha Kanjhar, Rampro Kanjhar, Gaza Kanjhar, and Vishnu Kanjhar are the names of the accused.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the police chief, stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver has sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred is temporarily closed so that emergency services can extract the driver from the red Audi TT.
First, he was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoja has since been at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court, accused of the murder of her son.
She is in custody, awaiting an indictment and trial, but any testimony could be tainted because her image has been widely publicized.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice works differently, and courts view the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that "it seems journalists are treading a dangerous line if they circulate pictures etc. of suspects."
The Royal Prosecution, responsible for criminal prosecution, indicated to journalists that no further comments would be made until charges are brought.
According to the leaked information, the document will pertain to the dispute over the borders that Palestine wants based on the pre-war Middle East borders of 1967.
The other discussed topics are assumed to concern the future state of Jerusalem, sacred to both parties, as well as the issue of the Jordan Valley.
After the signing of the agreement, Israel required a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years, while Pennsylvania agreed to implement such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the additional pest control test had to be closely supervised by rangers, as the test was being observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia, qualified volunteers were engaged in partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of "Conservation and Heritage" at the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), the four shooters selected for the first shooting received detailed safety instructions and training.
Marteli swore in front of the newly formed temporary electoral council consisting of nine members yesterday.
This is Martelli's fifth interim electoral council in four years.
Last month, a commission to the president recommended the resignation of the previous electoral commission (CEP) as part of a package of measures for the country to move towards new elections.
Martelli's response to the widespread protests against the regime, which began in October, was the commission.
The violent protests were sometimes triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been expected since 2011.
Reports indicate about 60 cases of malfunctioning iPod devices. Overheating is reported to have caused a total of six fires and caused minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 incidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company described as "insignificant."
The ministry responded, calling the delay of Apple's report "a future real regret."
Mariana was shaken by an earthquake at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The office for emergency situations in the Northern Mariana Islands reported that no damage has been inflicted in the country.
Also, from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in the Pacific, they said that there are no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman took tourists hostage in Hong Kong by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and as of now, there are at least six confirmed fatalities.
Six hostages, including children and adults, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released earlier.
Later, the photographers took the place of an elderly lady who needed a restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a medical career.
She trained as a midwife and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm birth in his spare time.
His research shows that if a hormone is applied, it will accelerate the fetal lung development of the baby.
Government investigators have found two flight data recorders "black boxes" on Wednesday, Xinhua reported.
Tributes were paid to Luna by fellow wrestlers as well.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. Quite unique, like her. She was a strong woman."
"Luna is strange like me... maybe even more... I love her and I will miss her... let's hope she's in a better place," commented Dustin "Goldust" Runnels.
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the federal elections in 2010, those who oppose the idea of turning Australia into a republic have increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that in her opinion, Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
This opinion is shared by 34% of those surveyed, who want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Ultimately, 29% of the respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while according to 31%, Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and participate in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical fitness is in doubt.
He couldn't take the medications he needed to manage the pain, since they are banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different software and hardware before the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water to Earth, along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets were formed, especially how Earth was formed, after comets collided with Earth many years ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense."
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that NextGen is a system that will allow aircraft to fly shorter distances, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
She uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to the older ground-based radar technology, to enable flight controllers to provide pilots with more accurate information and to determine the precise location of aircraft.
No additional transport is provided and the ground trains will not stop at Wembley, and there is no parking or drop-off parking available on site.
The fear of lack of transport raised the possibility that the game might have to be held behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal "Science" reports the emergence of a new species of birds on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that new species evolved in just two generations, despite it being thought that this process takes much longer, due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, the medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis), and the non-native cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into any shape. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be braided and twisted, then forged or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and adhered to another metal. So thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books known as "illuminated manuscripts."
This is the pH of a chemical substance. By using red cabbage juice, you can make an indicator.
Depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is, the cabbage juice changes its color.
The quantity of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the tested chemical indicates the pH level.
The hydrogen ions are protons from which the electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powdered substances and then shape them into a ball with clean wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, you'll feel it a bit strange, and something like a shell will form.
The cities Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had flush toilets in nearly every house, connected to a complex sewerage system.
In the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, remnants of sewer systems were discovered.
There were toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women in mixed company would gather together.
You use a satellite when you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away.
The satellite in space receives the call and almost instantly reflects it back.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
To place a satellite or telescope in space, a giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest thing we have thanks to the wheel is much easier and faster transportation.
Gave us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Under them are medium-sized cats, feeding on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
And lastly, there are many small cats (including domestic cats at large) feeding on a much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the niche concept, a special role that each cat occupies, which keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
Packs consist of one to three adult males with blood relation, along with up to thirty females and young ones.
Females are usually closely related, a large family of sisters and daughters.
Prides behave very much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behavior, and just as deadly to their prey.
The tiger, like a well-rounded athlete, can climb (albeit not well), swim, make huge leaps, and pull with the strength of five strong men.
In the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, the tiger is also included. These four cats are the only ones known for their roar.
The roar of the tiger does not completely resemble the lion's roar, but rather sounds more like the utterance of growling, screaming words.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. If they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) through their sense of smell, by sniffing where they have been on the ground.
With their night vision, they can see very well in the dark and move very silently. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into the environment and pouncing on their victim.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it crosses a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island, making return difficult), it often finds itself in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different functions or adaptations than before to be a strong competitor.
The indigenous population has not changed at all; it still requires the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it starts to resemble the remaining population less and less.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will differ so much that they cannot be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and take in carbon dioxide, which humans release (i.e. exhale).
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants, as well as make clothes from them. Most edible foods are plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional set in the top of his mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but he might have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he might even have been a cannibal.
It attacked everything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like T. Rex could compete with it.
Although most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans also had quite strange or unusual delicacies, including boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called dormice.
The other difference was that while the poor people and the women ate sitting on chairs, the wealthy men liked to hold banquets together, reclining to the side while they ate.
It is not possible that ancient Roman dishes included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, potatoes, tomatoes, cocoa, and not a single ancient Roman had tried turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet their needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, into which only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes special pyramid towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower represented a special sanctuary of the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not of such significance.
Most of the life of the Jewish family takes place outdoors.
The women were cooking in the yard; the shops were just shelves facing the street. The houses were built of stone.
In the land of Canaan, there are no vast forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Eric the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and traveling west, he discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
But regardless of his discovery, at that time Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Despite each of the countries being "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the peoples, the kings, the customs, and the history of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland.
You might think the treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence if you have watched the movie "National Treasure".
However, this is not true. This is not a treasure map, although there is something written on the back of the document.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776" are written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text is displayed at the bottom of the document upside down.
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning, after it was created, the large parchment (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be preserved.
The most likely case is that the notation was added only as a label.
With the landings on D-Day and the subsequent battles, northern France was liberated, but the south was still not free.
It was governed by the French from Vichy. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
The Allies entered Southern France on August 15, 1940, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
Within just two weeks, the American and French forces liberated Southern France and headed towards Germany.
Civilization represents a culture shared by a significant and large group of people working and living together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis," which means "civil," related to the Latin "civis" or "citizen" and "civitas," which means "city" or "city-state," and this somehow also defines the size of the society.
City-states were the predecessors of nations. Culture in the context of civilization implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and natural dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving corresponding historical evidence of their existence, and therefore fail to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government, with Congress being its sole component according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national judiciary or executive power, it relied on state authorities, who often refused to cooperate, to enforce all its acts.
It also has no authority to reject tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The clauses required unanimous agreement of all states to be amended, and the states regarded the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Along with the German national football team, the national football team of Italy is the second most successful team in the world. They were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, volleyball, basketball, cycling, water polo, fencing, rugby, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
The most popular in the northern regions are winter sports, with Italians competing both in international competitions and in the Olympic Games.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, as a geographical concept, it is often called an "archipelago."
Taiwan traces its origins back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the name of the island as "Ilha Formosa" or "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing changes to local grain production customs and hiring Chinese workers to labor on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the troops of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the northern and western coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the loss of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main structures, namely the Temple of the Sun, the Intihuatana, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of how they appeared.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues today.
The most common format for still photography in the world, for example, is 35 mm. This was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced today, but more importantly, its image format has been inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm tall.
The ratio of the sides of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole number denominator) is therefore 3:2.
The ratios equal or very close to this are very common formats (for example, a group of APS formats).
The much-abused and often mocked rule of thirds is simply a rule that creates dynamics while maintaining a measure of order in the image.
It states that the most suitable place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the picture into thirds vertically and horizontally (See the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had already become wealthy and powerful, was subjected to criticism.
The Christian religion has united the European countries for more than a thousand years, despite the linguistic differences and various customs.
His all-encompassing power affected everyone—from the king to the common man.
A fundamental Christian principle is that wealth should be used to reduce suffering and poverty and that the monetary funds of the church exist precisely for this reason.
The central authority of the church continued in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle had been upheld.
The United Kingdom begins a naval blockade of Germany soon after the outbreak of hostilities.
Despite the fact that this blockade violated established international law, codified in several international treaties over the past two centuries, the strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies.
The United Kingdom is mining international waters to prevent ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
Since the response to this tactic is limited, Germany expects a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, an attitude of pacifism and isolation prevailed among most citizens and nations.
The nations wanted to avoid a military situation again in the future after witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War.
To accept a job at the Edison company in New York, Tesla moved to the United States in 1884.
He arrives in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a collection of poetry, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job).
In Ancient China, there was a unique way of representing different periods of time; for each stage of history or for each ruling family, there was a separate dynasty.
Between every two dynasties, there has also been an unstable time of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods is the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods, there was a fierce war among many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China. Struggling to sit on the highest seat in the grand Xian Palace, thousands of people perished.
There are many social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not just to one ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, classes were opened to all male candidates, which allowed the most ambitious and successful ones to succeed.
The same applies to the military because instead of the unit in the army being based on class, it is now based on caliber.
The French Revolution is also an inspiration for many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was highly interested in things beyond this worldly life. To contemplate, he often visited a cave, which became known as "Hira" on the mountain Nur (light).
The cave itself, having survived through time, conveys a very vivid picture of the spiritual inclinations of Mohammed.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is entirely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. Once you enter the cave, the isolation is complete.
Nothing else can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky above us and the many surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, very little of this world can be seen.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists today.
Erected by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures constructed to honor the deceased pharaoh.
In the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, on the Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," there are several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid is in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, while many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples are in honor of his wives and family members.
The "up bow" sign resembles a V, while the "down bow" sign looks like a staple or a square without a bottom.
Up means you need to start from the tip and push the bow, and down means you need to start from the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and then pull it.
The upward-pointing bow usually produces a softer sound, while the downward-pointing bow is stronger and more confident.
Feel free to put your own markings, but remember that the printed bowings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), as well as the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, are forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
They returned to Paris by carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and yelling threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
At one point, someone from the crowd waved the head of a royal guard, killed in Versailles, in front of the horrified queen.
The Filipinos themselves paid the military expenses of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines.
The colonial regime of the USA forced them to pay taxes to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses.
The superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people are, of course, fundamental gains of American imperialism.
To understand the meaning of Templarism, the context that prompted the creation of the order must be clear.
The period during which the events took place is usually called the Late Middle Ages - the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages are preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally end around 1500 AD.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice - from technological push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is guided by logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Two general ideas are shared among most interpretations of technological determinism: the development of technology itself follows a path that far exceeds cultural or political influence, or the technology itself affects societies that are inherent rather than socially determined.
For example, one could say that motor vehicles inevitably lead to the development of roads.
However, a national road network will not be economically viable for just a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars also led to a higher frequency of road accidents, necessitating the invention of new healthcare techniques for the recovery of damaged bodies.
Romanticism contains a significant element of cultural determinism, initiated by writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shapes individuals, and over time customs and culture associated with this geography emerge, and they, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the way Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury dates back to around 400 BC and continues until about 1100 BC.
Her status declined in the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that the crusaders returned with gifts such as spices and silk, which were more valued than those offered by Byzantine markets.
At that time, the title "Fashion Capital" was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th–11th century and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication, Western styles can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. As a result of the Crusades, people started to use buttons to fasten their clothes, which was one of the greatest developments of that time.
Agriculture as a means of livelihood is the type of farming that is carried out to produce enough food solely for the needs of the farmer and his family.
Market-based agriculture is a simple, often organic system, frequently using preserved seeds from the same ecological area, combined with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques for maximum yield.
Historically, most farmers have engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this still holds true for many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel neglected by societal standards. They allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can vary by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The signs that define a given subculture as independent can be of a linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical nature, or a combination of factors.
Members of a given subculture often signal their membership through the characteristic and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the most commonly used means to illustrate the importance of socialization is the example of several unfortunate cases involving children who, due to neglect, poor treatment, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth period.
These children are called "untamed" or wild. Some untamed children have been kept confined by people (usually their own parents); sometimes the abandonment of such children was due to the parents' rejection of severe intellectual or physical disabilities of the child.
Wild children, before being abandoned or running away, may have been severely abused or traumatized.
Others are believed to have been raised by animals; for some, it is said that they lived alone in the wilderness.
When it is completely raised by animals, the feral child demonstrates behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely resembling that of the specific caregiving animal, as well as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
The construction of scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather an aid that provides support to individuals undergoing new training, such as a new computer program or the start of a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a type of scaffold, as well as the little paperclip person in Microsoft Office.
The software includes built-in virtual skeletons designed to ask questions, prompt, and explain procedures that may have been too difficult for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster families for many different reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not encouraging, nurturing, and educational, but it happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, as well as reliable healthcare.
Foster care is supposed to provide everything that was lacking in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and individual communication.
The special characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions regarding the use of the satisfaction approach.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are identified as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eimee and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
It is specifically claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his work "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks points out how, despite the fact that people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are still able to perceive sincere attitudes.
He even suggests that similar abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century showed that there are two groups of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the group of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the variations back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to fulfill its need for amino acids through the available plant resources.
Moreover, the consequences of failure are serious: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins from the leaves and seeds of legumes, but they are difficult for us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal-derived foods (termites, ants, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a large amount of proteins containing all essential amino acids.
Considering all this, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that the chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
The interruption of sleep is the process of deliberately waking up during your usual sleep time and falling asleep a little later (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily with a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without waking you completely.
If you find yourself turning off the clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythm include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known as a diuretic) before bedtime, which forces a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The less the tension, the more positive the life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute calm and satisfaction.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. Our own tension and negativity are the only things standing in our way of achieving this goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but is continued by many techniques from Indian yoga and the Mahayana "path of love."
Tibetan Buddhism is built on a very simple principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy for enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, visualizations, and mantras.
At the center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. Through visualization of different deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and enlightenment of consciousness is achieved.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, differences in the system, process, and culture led to conflict between these countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were already enemies and the Cold War had begun.
She continued through the next 40 years and a true battle was fought with mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Cuba, Afghanistan, and in many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already shattered, and the only hope was to withdraw along the Romanian bridgehead and reconsider its organization.
However, these plans became invalid almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after capturing the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral agreements.
The use of ships for transporting goods is the most efficient way to carry a large number of people and cargo across the oceans.
The traditional task of the naval fleets is to ensure your country's ability to move your people and goods, while simultaneously interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German naval forces are trying to stop this traffic, mainly with the help of submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Great Britain, like the rest of Europe.
Goats were likely domesticated for the first time around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountain ranges in Iran.
The ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them to have easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually raised in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often accompanied by goatherds who were typically children or adolescents, similar to the more widely known shepherd. These herding methods are still used today.
Railway lines were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the rail tracks consisted merely of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to achieve greater speed and pull larger loads than on the rougher roads characteristic of that time.
The sleepers were introduced relatively early to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the rails would be more effective with an iron strap on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Gradually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first entirely iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of transportation was walking, as people began to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of homo erectus (or the upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, generally did not walk upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2–3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living with more care for the environment, join an ecological movement, and even become activists to somewhat reduce negative impacts in the future.
In many cases, this is just like symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, then we must find the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is obvious that the world has changed significantly due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, and the problems have become greater due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people.
After being passed by Congress on July 4th and signed by the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, the handwritten copy was sent to the printing house of John Dunlap, located a few blocks away.
"Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night, now known as 'Dunlap broadsides.'"
The document was read publicly for the first time by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his soldiers on July 9 in New York. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadside copies that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived.
Nowadays, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. We call them birds.
Because they have feathers and can fly, many people do not think of them as dinosaurs.
But for the birds that still resemble dinosaurs, there are many things.
They have legs with claws and scales, walk on their two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex, and lay eggs.
Almost all computers used today operate based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, with these digits being called binary digits - or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning does not always manifest immediately. Symptoms such as vomiting are very common, making it difficult to diagnose immediately.
The presence of an open container with medicine or toxic household chemicals may be the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this poison.
The term bug is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term originates from the long-standing acquaintance with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Like flying bedbugs, ordinary bedbugs are also colorless, living in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young people and middle-aged individuals.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies show that the likelihood of having MS is twice as high in women as in men.
A given couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their interest or the interest of their child.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
Upon adoption, the parental rights of the biological parents are terminated, after which the other couple can become the parents of the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world functions through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides most scientific research.
It is not only experimentation, although experiments are also used to eliminate some of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and using guides also accompany scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers work more with classical texts, and particularly with the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of the knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from its Greek scientific and philosophical roots.
In physiology and behavior, many of the observed rhythms often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are more than just reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to perform the cycle of free movement, even if there are no external signals.
One of the leading hypotheses that DNA is genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells, mutations can have various effects.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is attractive to people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plant and animal species.
Activities that can be carried out here include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, as well as studying information about the ecosystem.
The visit, photographing, and studying of orangutans in Borneo are examples of this.
Every morning, to get to their workplace, people travel from small provincial towns by car, passing by others whose work destination is the place the former have just left.
In this dynamic transport system, everyone is to some extent connected with and supports the transport system through private cars.
That this massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has sustained human evolution for the past two million years, is now being demonstrated by science.
Every person is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, there are rarely so many complaints about water quality or deteriorating bridges.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they break down daily? Are the transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more important happening?
The traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Since the behavior of drivers unfortunately cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty, studying traffic flow is difficult.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range; thus, traffic flows have some logical consistency and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better illustrate the traffic flow, the relationships between the three main characteristics have been determined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections assist in the planning, design, and ultimately the operation of road facilities.
Insects are the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly has helped them to more easily avoid their enemies and to find food and mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings back along their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects today that cannot fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
Some people think that he is right, but many hold the opposite opinion - that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems reasonable because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the largest and second-longest river on Earth. It carries over 8 times more water than the second-largest river.
Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at some places it is 6 miles wide.
The Amazon provides a full 20 percent of the water that rivers on the planet pour into the oceans.
The main river Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. Thousands of smaller rivers flow into it.
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remain unsurpassed in size and technical construction excellence.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which by then were well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the state with the smallest population and the smallest independent country in the world.
The Vatican uses the Italian language in its legislation and for official communication.
While Latin is often used in religious ceremonies, Italian is the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state.
All citizens of Vatican City are Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as all of them can be found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is composed of one or more of the four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, though he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Alloys also exist that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
The universe is made of matter, which in turn is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So, when it appeared, the pencil was a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerged, the pencil was reduced to a lower status and usage.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens and do not need to touch pencil sharpeners.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer emerges.
The nuclear-plutonium bomb operates on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Something like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. After that, the splitting of the nucleus releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which makes them prone to decay with little or no push.
The lunar surface is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There may be more seas on the near side because the crust is thinner there. It has been easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Theories of happiness are focused on discovering what makes people respond or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires, which have been internalized by the time they reach adulthood.
These theories examine what makes certain people want the things they do and which things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Maslow's "Hierarchy of Needs" and Herzberg's "Two-Factor Theory of Motivation" are the two popular content theories.
Generally speaking, once managers start leading their former colleagues, two behaviors can emerge. On one hand, there are those who try to remain "I'm one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of managers encounter difficulties in implementing disciplinary measures, making unpopular decisions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
A person turns, at the other end of the spectrum, into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the team has done and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's successes and failures.
Such behavior often leads to a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as the normal ones, but there are subtle differences.
Members of the virtual team often serve as a point of contact with their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
"The Invisible Team" is the management team to which each member reports. This team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of creating a learning organization? Innovation, in practice, is one of the objectives of applying the concepts of organizational learning.
When all available resources in the functional departments of an organization are used efficiently, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the organization's process of overcoming obstacles can lead to a new innovative process in the service of the client's needs.
Before an organization becomes innovative, its leaders must create a culture of innovation, as well as organizational learning and shared knowledge.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher results.
The physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the study of knowledge is provided by neurobiological data. This narrows the field of study and makes it much more precise.
The link between pathology and brain behavior supports scientists' research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, injuries, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and change some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that were previously unseen.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although artificial intelligence is of great significance in science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with learning, behavior, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence involves the creation of machines that automatically perform tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Some of the examples that can be listed are control, planning and scheduling, ability to respond to diagnoses and client inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
Similar problems have become separate disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The artificial intelligence system, which is integrated into several home computer and software applications for video games, is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military.
Excursions are a big part of school education. Very often, a teacher would like to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The technology offers a solution through virtual tours. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire the beauty of art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a trip in practice is also a great way to document a journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennett School in North Carolina create a webpage for their trip to the state capital; each year this page is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a sketchbook.
Blogs can be helpful in improving students' writing. While students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, having an audience usually changes that fact.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger has started striving to improve his writing in order to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "forces students to be more aware of the world around them." The need to nurture the audience's interest inspires students to be interesting and smart (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the regular school day.
Through the appropriate use of blogs, "students can be enabled to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet materials in the context of other people's writings, students can define their positions, and also outline their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is a charming and bilingual capital of Canada, where there are a number of art galleries and museums where you can see the past and present of Canada.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and to the north are the unspoiled natural beauties of Muskoka and the surrounding lands.
All these things cement Ontario as a model of the typical Canadian according to foreigners.
The large areas in the north are quite sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabitable deserts.
A comparison of the population that has surprised many: the number of African Americans in the USA is larger than that of Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean near the African east coast.
Madagascar is the largest and is in itself a separate continent in terms of wildlife.
Most small islands are independent nations or are associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it had a great influence on the Comoros Islands and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the route "Cape of Good Hope," the sea route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the west and south, it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is advisable for every traveling woman to claim that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It is nice to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can create situations considered by them as harassment, where they are often followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Be firm when you refuse men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name "Casa Branca," but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan restored the city as Dar el-Beida, and it received the name Casablanca from Spanish traders who established their trading posts there.
Across all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping.
It is easy to find places around the old Medina where traditional Moroccan goods are sold, such as tagines, ceramics, leather products, hookahs, and a whole range of trinkets, but all of this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which flooded most of the city's streets, especially the downtown area.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside of Goma should be researched to understand the fighting conditions that continue in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the cheapest ways to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a "boda-boda" (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
"Timbuktu," in conjunction with its relative inaccessibility, has gained use as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today Timbuktu is a poor city, although it has been turned into a tourist attraction due to its reputation and has an airport.
It was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites in 1990 due to the threat of desert sands.
This was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS show, "The Wonders of the African World."
The city sharply differs from the other cities in the country, because it has a more Arab appearance rather than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and stretches eastward along the border with Mozambique, to the north is Zimbabwe, and the Crocodile River is its southern boundary.
The park covers 19,500 km², divided into 14 separate ecozones, each with different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the leading one of the National Parks of South Africa (SANParks).
Usually, all South African national parks require daily fees for entry and park conservation.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to either selected parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider worth visiting.
The row of buildings that shape the skyline of Hong Kong is likened to a glittering bar chart that stands out against the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To best explore Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Most of the developed part of Hong Kong Island is densely situated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that British colonizers appropriated and if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this territory, it's a good idea to start here.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This part of the forest, which is located on Indian territory, is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not only mangrove swamps — they include some of the last remnants of the great jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², with almost one-third of this territory covered by water and swamps.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses depart throughout the day from the interregional bus station (across the river), although most of them, especially those heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance, as intercity buses are often full.
Most neighborhoods are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient means of travel for short distances, such as to Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two masts rise to 83 meters, the length is 378 meters, with 2 sails each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous tribe whose members inhabited what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced agriculture for sustenance.
The Chaco region is home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who have survived through hunting, gathering fruits, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of India," was born in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and local groups.
The Spaniards began the colonization period, which lasted for three centuries.
Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its unique character and identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and individual polo players in the world.
The largest annual tournament is held in December at the polo field in Las Canitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be watched here at another time of the year.
Check the Asociacion Argentina de Polo for news about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP) with a value equal to one British pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at a bank located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store, which is the only one on the islands.
British pounds are usually accepted everywhere on the islands, and US dollars are also often accepted through Stanley credit cards.
On the outer islands, they are unlikely to accept credit cards, but British and American currency can be used; speak with the hosts beforehand to find out what the acceptable method of payment is.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical region; during the summer months, temperatures above +30 °C are normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the combined wind and humidity lead to a feeling of it being colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no special "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Despite the fact that many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals still remain wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they appear, bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they did not maintain the necessary distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so do not invade their personal space.
In addition, keep in mind that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of almost 40,000 people.
Apia, which has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959, was founded in the 1750s.
At the port in 1889, a scandalous sea collision occurred when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and the UK refused to leave it.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the "Mau" movement, a peaceful gathering in the city ends with the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Since Auckland spans two harbors, there are many beaches. The most popular ones are in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are patrolled sandy bathing beaches, and most have shade under the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are by the Waitemata Harbour, on the outskirts of the expensive areas of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One." It is not a heavy beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. "Manta" is the name of the other local beer.
There are many French wines to try, but New Zealand and Australian ones may go down better.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easily available if you're afraid.
The idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign to Australians. The short black is "espresso," the cappuccino is topped to the brim with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets the standard for Belgian. The fruit juices are a bit pricey, but wonderful.
Many of the trips to the reef take place year-round, and accidents on the reef caused by any of these reasons are rare.
Nevertheless, pay attention to the advice of the authorities, follow all the signs, and pay special attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of the town of 1770. They can sometimes be encountered outside this period as well.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is along the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance provides peace of mind for the traveler that there will be a place to stay upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agents often have arrangements with certain hotels, although you can find other accommodations like campsites through a travel agent.
Tourist agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g., visa).
However, any changes or requests should first be directed to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, a vast majority of the participants decide to camp on the festival grounds, and most participants consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the event, you will need to go earlier to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages might be over, there may be festival stages where it will continue to play late into the night.
Some festivals offer special camping spots for families with young children.
If you cross the North Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, as for those most affected, the crossing over ice causes quite a terrible sound.
The cruises to Saint Petersburg also include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Usually, casinos make a lot of effort for guests to spend as much time and money as possible. Generally, there are no windows and clocks, and the exits can be hard to find.
To keep the guests in good spirits and to retain them in the venue, they usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment deals.
In some places, free alcoholic drinks are offered. However, intoxication affects judgment, and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who will be driving at high altitudes or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or below freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is weak, and you cannot drive as you would on clean asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short time for you to get stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or blizzard, as well as by condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, ice and snowfall are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are arguably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and are the ultimate destination for many visitors.
The term "safari" in its popular use refers to an overland journey to observe the astounding African wildlife, specifically in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to the cars, and a good view can be achieved with standard equipment.
Sometimes lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy and are better observed with binoculars.
The walking safari (also called "wilderness walk," "tourist safari," or "walking") is a hike lasting several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held between August 24 and September 5, 2021. Some of the events will take place in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the season's postponement was announced, you might find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies are not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
Expectations are that most tickets will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with regular ones costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available, even if there aren't any in the room.
If there is no iron or you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if there is one.
Do not allow the fabric to become too hot (which can cause shrinking or, in extreme cases, scorching).
Water can be purified in different ways, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, bringing water to a boil for a minute is sufficient, while in others, several minutes are necessary.
Filters have varying effectiveness, and if you are concerned, you should consider purchasing water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pest animals that are unfamiliar to them from their native places.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals by themselves, which can harm or kill people with force, are generally not classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods without taxes and excises at certain places.
Travelers going to countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The distance between Point Marion and Fairmont represents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated remote areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be alert: there are steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp bends.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the preceding or following sections, where they are usually 35–40 mph (56–64 km/h), and strictly adhering to them is more important than in other places.
What's curious, however, is that mobile phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as the Pennsylvanian wilderness.
German pastries are exceptionally good, and the Bavarian ones are quite lavish and diverse, similar to those prepared in their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruity desserts are often made, with apples being used in pastries year-round, while cherries and plums are used in the summer.
Many German baked goods include almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small yet rich pastries, try these, which, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
The curry is a dish of meat or vegetables with herbs and spices.
Depending on the amount of liquid, the curry can be "dry" or "wet".
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is most commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella encompassing a wide variety of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the country.
However, if used without additional definitions, the term usually refers to dishes originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Nowadays widely spread across the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes a multitude of simply seasoned dishes, and the predominant flavors that the Javanese prefer are chili peppers, peanuts, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), as well as a variety of aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports hanging from both sides of the saddle for the rider's feet.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but safety concerns may arise due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
In the event that a rider is thrown from a horse and their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they will be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First and foremost, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, narrow sole.
Later, some saddles, especially the English ones, have safety bars allowing the stirrup leather to come off the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley - the best destination for climbers in Chile, known as the South American Yosemite, with an abundance of large granite walls and boulders.

The snow descents, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving descending a snowy terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity with many enthusiasts, more commonly known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations centered around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.!
Skiing dates as a sport at least from the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians founded the first sports ski club in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski tourism.
They are similar, but usually do not include alpine-style ski tours or mountaineering, as the latter take place on steeper terrain and require much sturdier skis and boots.
Look at the ski route as similar to a hiking one.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than if you were walking – but you will very rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on maintained tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean going through multiple visa applications and passport controls.
However, the Schengen Area functions somewhat like a single country in this regard.
While you are in the territory of this zone, in general, you can cross the borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
In the same way, if you hold a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for separate visas for each of the Schengen member states, thereby saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define items over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft items can be accepted as antiques, even though they are not as old as the mass-produced ancient goods.
Raising reindeer is an important livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding this livelihood is important to many others with different occupations.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi have engaged in large-scale reindeer herding but have subsisted through fishing, hunting, and similar activities, with reindeer primarily being draft animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern professions. Tourism is a profitable industry in Sampi, one of the regions where the Sami live.

The opinions presented are often superficial, general, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information that is available elsewhere.
Bad weather is the main term for any dangerous meteorological phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social problems, or loss of human life.
Anywhere in the world can have severe weather, and its manifestations are very different and can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are all forms and impacts of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, floods, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather conditions include blizzards, snow, ice, and sandstorms.
Travelers need to be aware of any risk of severe weather conditions affecting their area, as these can influence any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that might be designated as a war zone should receive professional training.

The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, many first aid activities, and sometimes weapons handling training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but there are few publications addressing military zones.
Passengers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they carry valid documents for their return.
The willingness of governments to issue passports to individuals with an unspecified gender (X) or to update documents to reflect the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to comply with these documents is also a variable quantity.
Searches at checkpoints have also become much more thorough in the period following September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals who are about to undergo surgery should not expect to pass through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the returning flow from the waves that break on the shore, often at a reef or something similar.
The return flow, due to the underwater topology, is concentrated in several deeper sections, and a rapid current towards deep water can form there.
Most deaths are due to exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which is likely impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to aim somewhere you won't get caught again, or you might want to wait for rescue, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted.
The shock of returning occurs faster than culture shock (has a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have found it relatively easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their own culture.
When you return home after living abroad, where you have adapted to the new culture there, you have lost some of your habits from the culture at home.
At first, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that newcomers to a new country need to adapt.
People may not expect that returning home travelers also need patience and understanding.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.

The Sphinx serves as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are presented on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
Several nations claim the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, and they have the most bases, with sixteen of them active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest island.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, which has a spectacular natural harbor due to the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then rise again to form a 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, cleaved by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, or the Sentinel Range, is the highest mountain in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson reaching 4892 meters.
In remote locations without mobile phone coverage, your only option might be a satellite phone.
The satellite phone generally does not replace the mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors with a direct line of sight to the satellite in order to make a phone call.
The service is often used by shipping, including recreational vessels, as well as by expeditions that require remote data and voice data.
More information on connecting with this service can be provided by your local telephone service provider.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular among school graduates, as it gives them a year off before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year would improve your chances of gaining admission to higher education in your home country.
There is usually a "tuition" fee in order to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a wonderful destination for boating. "The Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands located in the lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes, it is not mandatory to have a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually large enough for yachts, smaller boats and kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
The number is the same in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands, the figure is from 1 to 40).
Most reputable Baltic cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you will be able to visit the historic city for a whole two days, returning and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you go ashore using the excursions organized by the ship, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Berlin, Germany is featured in some of the cruise brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea at all, and the cruise price does not include a visit to the city.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have experienced a traumatic event or have never flown before.
This is not something we should be ashamed of: it is no different from personal fears and hatred towards other things that a large number of people have.
For some people, understanding how aircraft operate and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or a lack of control.
Courier companies are paid well to deliver things quickly. Often, timing is very important for business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and for smaller companies, this has been a problem.
If they have sent items by air transport, on some routes unloading and customs clearance can take days.
The only way for it to go faster was to send it as checked luggage. Airline rules do not allow sending luggage without a passenger, which is your case.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to shell out a fat stack of cash for this privilege (or even better, to have your company do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: in general, you can expect to pay up to four times more than the normal economy fare for business and eleven times more for first class!
Overall, there is no point in even looking for business or first-class discounts for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay a significantly higher price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and accordingly, they are charged for it.
Chișinău is the capital of Moldova. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic suffering from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the separation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Moldovan Republic, which, despite having its own government and currency, is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, the economic ties between these two parts of Moldova were restored.
Eastern Orthodoxy is the main religion in Moldova.

Rare species of fauna can be seen there, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie, along with many other common species.
During their visit to the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts below the knees, and their shoulders must also be covered.
Most monasteries provide cloaks for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially in bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
By the same logic, men should wear trousers that cover their knees.
The clothing can be borrowed from the available ones at the entrance, but it's not washed after each user, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
Like in similar regions in the Mediterranean, Majorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil everywhere.

These observatories, before the modern ones today, are generally outdated and are now used as museums or educational facilities.
Since light pollution, even at its peak, was not as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or campuses, and are more accessible than those built nowadays.
Most modern survey telescopes are large facilities located in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
The observation of cherry blossom, known as "hanami," has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.

All animals that initially arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying, or sailing.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were not able to make the journey, which turned the giant tortoise into the first herbivorous animal on the Galapagos.
After the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals such as goats, cows, horses, rats, cats, and dogs have been introduced there.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in the winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the Sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark almost around the clock.
