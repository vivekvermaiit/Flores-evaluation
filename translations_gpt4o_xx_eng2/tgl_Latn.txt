Not only does it confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely accepted theory, but it also provides details that are usually not provided by fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangements.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers are chestnut brown on top with a pale or carotenoid color on the underside.
The discovery also provided insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a strong shaft, called a rachis, but have other feather characteristics such as "barbs and barbules," researchers thought that the rachis is likely a more recent evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers proposed that even though it is a tail of a young dinosaur, the example shows that it is the feather of an adult dinosaur and not the downy and thin feathers of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not chick feathers.

In France, voting has long been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, place a pre-printed piece of paper indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter will drop the envelope into the ballot box and sign the list of qualified voters.

Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Uka's gun failed while aimed at the fifth man's head. Schneider has persistent pain, blindness in one eye, a missing part of the skull, and a face reconstructed from titanium.
Schneider testified via a video link from a USAF base in his hometown.
Aside from the competition last Wednesday, Carpanedo competed in two individual races at the Championship.
His first was the Slalom, where he received a Did Not Finish in his first run. 36 out of 116 competitors had a similar result in that race.
In her other race, the Giant Slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting group with a combined run time of 4:41.30, slower by 2:11.60 minutes than the first-place winner, an Austrian named Claudia Loesch, and slower by 1:09.02 minutes than the ninth-place winner, Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four skiers in the group of women sitting failed to finish their race, and 45 out of 117 skiers failed to place in the Giant Slalom race.
The police of Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
According to Deputy Inspector General D K Aray, "We have arrested the five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile and laptop."
The accused were named as Baba Kanjar, Bhuta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Even though three people were inside the house when it was hit by a car, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The street where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while members of the emergency group were extracting the driver from the red Audi TT vehicle.
He was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred again to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with killing her child.
He is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any witness testimony may be tainted because his image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but the administration of justice in Scotland is different, and the courts have viewed the publication of images as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted that "journalists seem to be walking on the brink of disaster when publishing images and so forth of suspects."
The Crown Office, which oversees all prosecutions, indicated to journalists that there would be no further comment at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the revelation, refers to the border dispute, where Palestine desires it based on the pre-1967 Middle East War boundaries.
Other topics are estimated to include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is requesting the retention of a military presence in the valley for ten years after an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to the retention of such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplementary pest control test will be carefully supervised by the rangers, as the test is monitored and its effectiveness is evaluated.
In a collaboration between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the association’s hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage of NPWS Park, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
The new Provisional Council (CEP) composed of nine members was sworn in by Martelly yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the CEP as part of preparations to bring the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-administration protests that began in October.
The protests, which were sometimes violent, were sparked by frustration over the failure to hold elections, some of which should have taken place as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating due to defective iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan stated that they have long been aware of the 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake occurred in Mariana at local time 07:19 a.m. (09:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The office for emergency management of the Northern Marianas said that no damages were reported in the country.
Similarly, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there is no indication of a Tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists using his M16 rifle.
Many hostages were rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and adults, were released early, as well as Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and worked in the field of medicine.
He studied as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating early childbirth discomfort during his free time.
His research shows that when a hormone is given, it accelerates the maturation of the baby's lungs in the womb.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Likewise, Luna was honored by his fellow wrestlers.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of a blue moon. Truly unique like her. A brave woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels expressed that "Luna is as peculiar as I am... perhaps even more... I love her and I'm excited for her... I hope she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the federal election in 2010, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed have this view, wishing that Queen Elizabeth II would be the last queen of Australia.
On either end of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The swimmer who won a gold medal at the Olympics is scheduled to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, the strength of his body is being doubted.
He cannot take the drugs needed to alleviate the pain he feels because they are banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Some people proved the discovery using various hardware and software at the beginning of February and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the possible source of delivering water to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists wish to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his tenure as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
He is suspected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow airplanes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
This uses satellite-based technology as opposed to the old land-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to identify aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transportation is provided and the overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available in the area.
Concerns about transportation shortages raised the possibility that the match might be forced to take place behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species in the Ecuadorean Galapagos Islands.
The researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species underwent evolution in just two generations, even though this process was believed to persist longer, due to breeding between a native Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be molded into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn out into thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It can be made extremely thin, which is why it was once used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of the chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The juice of cabbage changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity (base) of the chemical.
The pH level indicates the amount of Hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical analyzed.
Hydrogen atoms are composed of only one proton separate from its electron, and the separated hydrogen ion is commonly called a proton.
Mix the two dry powders together in a circular motion, and then, using clean wet hands, squeeze them until they form a ball shape.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, creating a strange sensation and forming a skin-like layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro once had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
The ruins of sewer systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, the toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women were together.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space will receive the call and almost immediately send it back down.
The satellite in space is sent through a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere causes some distortion in our light and vision.
A large rocket with a height of 100 feet is necessary to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in extraordinary ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to provide us with easier and faster transportation.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Following them were many more cats that were of considerable size, devouring animals that they had hunted, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including stray pet cats) eat more and more small prey such as insects, rats, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is having the appropriate task or a special activity to avoid competition among each cat.
Lions are the friendliest cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides are composed of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and cubs.
The women often have close relationships with each other, like one large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that strangely resemble lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also extremely fierce to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (although not very well), swim, leap long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones capable of roaring.
The roar of a tiger is not like the strength of a lion's roar, but more like a sentence of shouted, screaming words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will hunt monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that an ocelot seeks are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and hunt their prey through smell, sniffing where they are on the ground.
They can see clearly in the dark through night vision and can also move stealthily. Ocelots catch their prey by adapting to their environment and then pouncing on their prey.
If a small group of living things (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population from which they originated (such as if they go to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a place that is different from where they came from.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will require different traits or adaptations in order to be stronger competitors than they previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all; they still need the same adaptation as before.
As time passes, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, their appearance starts to change more and more compared to another population.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be classified as the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen which is inhaled by humans, and they take in the carbon dioxide exhaled by humans.
Plants make their food from sunlight using photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Almost all of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws have 70 sharp teeth, including an extra row at the top of its mouth, meaning no one can escape once they encounter it.
We are not certain, but it might have evolved a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it might even have been cannibalistic.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even giant dinosaurs like T. rex would not prevail here.
Although we are familiar with many of their foods, the Romans also had their astonishing or extraordinary dishes prepared at feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of mouse called dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and the women eat seated on chairs, wealthy men prefer to have banquets together where they will sit reclining while eating.
The foods of Ancient Rome may not have included those that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cacao, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was recognized as the house of the god.
People will bring offerings for the gods and the priests will try to attend to the needs of the gods through ceremonies and feasts.
Every temple has an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests can enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, are built to be part of temples.
The pinnacle of the tower is a unique sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house did not become very important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family happened outside.
The women cook in the yard; the stores are just open counters facing the street. Stone was used in the construction of the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the value of wood was very expensive.
Few settled in Greenland. In the long sagas of the Norse, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for the crime of murder, and while journeying further west, he saw Greenland and named it Greenland.
But whatever he discovered, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
English sentence: Although each country is 'Scandinavian', there are many differences among the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have already watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text is at the bottom part of the document, upside down.
Even though no one is certain who the author is, it is known that early in its life, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
That's why, perhaps the brief note was placed just to serve as a marker.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles liberated Northern France, but the south was still not free.
It is under the control of the French "Vichy". These are people from France who agreed with the Germans in 1940 and became collaborators with the occupiers rather than their enemies.
On August 15, 1940, the allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the American and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a vast group of people who live and support each other, a society.
The word civilization originates from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and it also somehow indicates the size of society.
City-states are the origin of nations. Civilization culture signifies the transmission of knowledge through many generations, a lasting footprint of culture and equitable dissemination.
Secondary cultures often vanish without leaving significant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as deserving civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—the Congress as its singular part—under the Articles of Confederation.
The congress has no power to impose taxes, and, because there is no national executive or judiciary, it relies on the state authorities, who often do not cooperate, to enforce all its laws.
It also does not have the power to nullify tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles require unanimous consent from all states before they can be amended, and the states did not take the central government seriously, so their representatives were often absent.
The national football team of Italy, as well as the national football team of Germany, are the second most successful teams in the world and became champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Included among the popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are most well-known in the Northern regions, and Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan holds almost 7,000 islands (with the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands of Japan, Japan is often called an "archipelago" because of its geographical location.
The origin of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when passing European sailors recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating the transformation of indigenous grain production practices and providing jobs for Chinese workers in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) dominated the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three primary structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
In the year 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photography format in the world for capturing stills is 35 mm, which became the primary film size at the end of the analog film era.
This is still being done today, but more importantly, the image sensor formats of digital cameras have inherited its aspect ratio.
The 35 mm format is actually, seemingly confusing, 36mm wide and 24mm tall.
The aspect ratio of this format (divide by twelve to get the simplest whole-number ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are approximately or equivalent to this aspect ratio.
The overly-abused and often-ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guide that creates excitement while maintaining a level of order in a picture.
This states that the most effective place for the main subject is usually at the intersections of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, underwent scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian faith has united the states of Europe despite differences in language and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to the common person.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's financial funds are there for that particular purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle is being upheld.
Not long after the outbreak of the battles, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy was proven effective, cutting off crucial supplies for the military and civilians, although this blockade violated the commonly accepted international law that had been established as a system through several international agreements in the past two centuries.
The United Kingdom mined international waters to prevent the entry of any ships throughout the ocean areas, causing risks even to neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted warfare through submarines.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations desired to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different eras; each stage of China or each family that possessed power was a specific dynasty.
Between each dynasty was also the tumultuous period of divided provinces. The most well-known among these is the period of the Three Kingdoms, which occurred over 60 years between the Han and the Jin Dynasty.
In these times, a fierce war occurred among many nobles who were fighting to ascend the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China, with thousands of people perishing as they vied for the highest position in the luxurious palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Likewise, after the Revolution, jobs opened up to all male applicants, giving the most ambitious and successful the opportunity to succeed.
This can also be said about the military because instead of the army ranks being based on class, they are now based on excellence in warfare.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad developed a deep interest in matters beyond this worldly life. He often visited the cave known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) for his contemplation.
The very cave, which has withstood the ages, provides a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Found at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is really not easy to find it even if someone knows it exists. Once inside the cave, it is truly isolated.
There is nothing to see but the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Only a tiny part of this world can be seen or heard inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still remains today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the large pyramid structures constructed to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, has many pyramids (with the Great Pyramid being the largest), numerous smaller tombs, many temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "uphill slash" mark looks like a V and the "downhill slash" mark resembles a staple or a square without the bottom part.
Upward means you should start at the end and push the chisel, and downward means you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the chisel) and pull the chisel.
The upward strike usually creates a softer sound, while the downward strike is louder and more assertive.
Do not hesitate to write your own marks using a pencil, but remember that the printed marks for the movement of the sharpener are there for musical reasons, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced by a crowd of market women to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and yelling threats against the King and Queen.
The King and Queen were forced to fully open the windows of their carriage because of the unruly crowd.
On one occasion, a member of the crowd waved the head of the king's guard leader who was killed at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The expenses of the war of imperialist United States in its occupation of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S. to fund a large part of the expenses and the interest on the bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government through banks on Wall Street.
Of course, the excess profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people will form the primary benefit of United States imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that prompted the formation of the order.
The period during which these events took place is often called the High Middle Ages, a stage in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that covers a wide range of ideas in practice, from the push of technology or extreme technological necessity to the precise understanding that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the advancement of technology itself follows a path that transcends cultural or political power, and that this technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than conditioned by society.
For example, it can be said that cars drive the construction of roads.
However, the national network of roads would not be a profitable business if it were only for a few vehicles, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Owning many cars leads to a higher number of road accidents, which has resulted in the invention of new healthcare techniques for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism contains significant elements of cultural determinism, originating from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, the customs and culture related to that geography emerged, and these, being in accord with the place of society, are even better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its recognition as a center of luxury began in 400 A.D. and lasted until 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the twelfth century due to the fact that the Christian conquerors or Crusaders returned with gifts like silks and spices that were valued more than what the Byzantine market could offer.
This is the time when the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was at the height of its popularity between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slowness of the communication channels, the modes in the west could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop their own style. One of the greatest advancements during that time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses locally adapted seeds natural to the eco-region along with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to increase yield.
According to history, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite people with similar mindsets who feel marginalized by societal norms and allow them to form a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, status, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as unique can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often express their membership through the unique and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, practices, and slang language.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to base it on a few undesirable conditions of children who were not taught good manners by adults as they grew up due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have previously been confined by humans (often their own parents); in other cases, this abandonment of the child is due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Children who have limited interaction with people from a young age may have first experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Some are believed to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived in the forest by themselves.
When fully raised by animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (according to physical limitations) that are almost like those shown by the animal caretaker, such as fear or a cold demeanor towards humans.
Although project-based learning should facilitate and make learning interesting, structuring support achieves more than that.
Providing components for studying or scaffolding is not a method of learning but rather a support that gives aid to individuals undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolds can be both virtual and real. This means that a teacher is a form of scaffold as well as Clippy from Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolding frameworks are embedded in the software and aim to question, suggest, and explain methods that may have been difficult for the student to tackle alone.
Children are placed in orphanages for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, and even to exploitation.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, compassionate, and educational, yet they are there.
We consider orphanages to be safe places for these children.
The system of our orphanage should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, continuous education, and reliable healthcare.
The orphanage should provide all the needs that were not met by the former home they were taken from.
The Internet unified the elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet pave the way for additional forms concerning the uses and gratifications approach.
For example, "study" and "interaction" are suggested as important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"The personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated listeners' reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in interpreting micro expressions, facial movements that occur within just a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that a person can determine if someone is lying by correctly interpreting their small expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, indicated how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still correctly assess sincerity.
He even suggested that such abilities in interpreting human behavior might be the same in animals like domesticated dogs.
Research in the twentieth century showed that there are two groups of genetic diversity: latent and manifest.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of variations that are actually usable.
Separation and recombination shuffle variation back and forth between the two pools each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its required amino acids from plant sources.
Moreover, the failure to do this has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The easiest resources to obtain from plants would have been the proteins in the leaves and legumes, but it is difficult for primates like us to digest them unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they also provide a lot of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as the monkeys on the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your usual sleep period and going back to sleep after a short period (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring back your consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself changing the time on your sleep clock, it could be placed on the other side of your room, so you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biological rhythm require drinking plenty of fluids (specifically water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleeping, causing one to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
If the tension is lower, the force of life that exists will be more positive. Every person has the potential to find complete peace and tranquility.
Each person can attain enlightenment. The only things that hinder this goal are our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it is expanded by the path of mahayana love and in the numerous techniques derived from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all who love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the energy of Kundalini (energy of consciousness) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Deities. By visualizing various deities in the mind, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany became an enemy of all during World War 2, which led to cooperation between the USSR and USA. At the end of the war, the conflicts in systems, processes, and cultures became the cause of disagreements among the countries.
Within two years after the end of the war, the former allies had become adversaries, and the Cold War began.
It will last for the next 40 years and will truly be fought by proxy armies in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was shattered, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union attacked and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, whether bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for the delivery of products is the best method of all for the transportation of large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional role of naval forces is to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and products, while simultaneously hindering your opponent's ability to move their people and products.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII (World War II). The Americans were then attempting to transport men and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
Simultaneously, the German navy, primarily using U-boats, was trying to obstruct this traffic.
If the Allies had happened to fail, Germany would likely have conquered Britain as it had already done with most of mainland Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated almost 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to tend to them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
The domesticated goats are often placed in flocks that roam the mountains or other pastures, usually tended by shepherds who are often children or young people, similar to the more well-known shepherds. The method of tending the flock is still used today.
The wagon ways were made in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though the carts are made up of aligned wooden planks, it allows horses to pull them faster and to haul larger loads than on somewhat rougher roads.
The trusses were used early to keep the rails fixed. However, it was gradually realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had a narrow strip of steel on top.
This activity became widespread, but the steel caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with steel wheels. In 1767, the first all-steel rails were introduced.
The earliest known form of transportation was walking, where people began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
The ones before them, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as is commonly practiced.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a way that is less harmful to our environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering in some way.
It is similar to treating symptoms in many cases. However, if we don't want only a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and stop them from functioning.
It is evident that the world has significantly changed due to the advancements in science and technology of humankind, and the problems have become more severe due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people.
After it was ratified by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the print shop of John Dunlap, a few blocks away.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon at the yard of the Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his soldiers in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to still exist are the oldest remaining copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not believe that they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are still many things about birds that are similar to dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk using their two hind feet like a T-Rex.
Almost all of the computers currently in use are based on controlling information encoded through binary numbers.
The binary number can only have one of two values, for example, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, when used in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms like vomiting are generally sufficient, which is why immediate examination is not conducted.
The best indication of internal poisoning might be the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic chemicals in the house.
Check the label for specific instructions for first aid for that specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term is derived from the ancient knowledge of the complete understanding of bedbugs, which are insects well-adapted to infest humans.
The Assassin-bugs and Bed-bugs both depend for a long time on their parents after being born, adapted to living in the nest or burrow of their host.
Throughout the entire United States of America, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and it is considered the primary neurological disorder among young adults and those in middle adulthood.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to develop MS than men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not beneficial for them or for the welfare of their child.
The couple may decide to put their baby up for adoption.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple may raise the child.
The primary aim of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method, in fact, guides most scientific research.
It's not alone, experimenting, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions, and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, are accepted.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West found itself distanced from its Greek philosophical and scientific origins.
Many of the observed rhythms in body structure and behavior are highly dependent on the processes occurring within their bodies and their production through the biological clock.
Seasonal rhythms, which are not just responses to external seasonal cues, have been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that continue the period of free-running cycles even without external cues.
The experiment by Hershey and Chase is one of the leading proposals that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments marking either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are cells for sexual reproduction.
Only mutations in the cells of the germline can be passed on to offspring, while mutations anywhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural sites for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including plants and wildlife in the forest.
Examples of actual activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the environment.
One example is visiting, taking photos, and studying about orangutans in Borneo.
Every day, people leave the small towns of the country in cars to get to their workplaces, passing others whose workplace is the place they came from.
In the dynamic movement of this transportation, all people are in some way connected to, and support, a transportation system based on private vehicles.
Science today suggests that this extensive carbon economy has removed the ecological system (biosphere) from its stable state that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you will rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why are these complaints happening with transportation systems, why do they fail every day? Are the transportation engineers really incapable? Or is there something more important going on?
The Flow of Traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Sadly, analyzing traffic flow is not easy because driver behavior cannot be estimated with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a stable range; therefore, the flow of traffic also remains unchanged and can be estimated using mathematics.
To better describe the flow of traffic, connections have been made between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing, and managing road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them to more easily conquer their enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings alongside their bodies.
It gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Now, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
How many people believed that he was correct, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems significant, because it does not feel like the world is moving, does it not?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times the volume of water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes six miles wide.
The entire 20 percent of the water flowing from rivers on the planet to the seas comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids using stone did not cease until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical skill of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Italian is also the daily language used by most of the people working in the state, while Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the main chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all of these can be found in nature in their native form and are easily mined using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, assumed that all things are composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
More like this are the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also assumed that these become new things to form what we see.
Alloys are usually mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table and some of them are also metals (such as calcium and potassium) and can be mixed with other metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are metals like silver and gold as well.
You can also have alloys with a small mixture of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny things called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly tiny that trillions of them can fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil became a good friend to many people when it came out.
Sadly, as new methods of writing emerged, the pencil was placed in a lower status and uses.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, which will never need to be sharpened.
A person will only know what might happen to the keyboard when something newer arrives.
The fission bomb operates on the principle that energy must combine the nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Perhaps it is like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Thus, the splitting of the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms are those with an imbalance in the number of protons and neutrons, which means they are likely to disappear when there is little or no matching number of protons and neutrons.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crustal part is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker beneath the highlands.
There might be more maria in the visible parts of the world because the crust is thinner. It's easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on identifying what can motivate people or capture their attention.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they embrace as they age.
These theories are about what drives some people to desire what they do and what factors in their environment prompt them to do or not do certain things.
Two well-known content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Overall, two behaviors may emerge as managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager finds it difficult to make decisions that many will not like, to discipline, to assess performance, to assign responsibilities, and to hold people accountable.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, a person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the group is already doing and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often results in misunderstandings between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams are also held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of the virtual team often serve as the point of contact for their own physical group.
Often, they have more autonomy than members of the usual group because their groups can meet according to different time zones that their local administration may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a distinctive part of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the team that manages where each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of building a learning organization? One goal for actively implementing the concepts of organizational learning is innovation.
If all resources are effectively utilized throughout an organization's active departments, creativity and intelligence will be expressed.
As a result, the process of an organization's collaborative effort to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to serve the customer's needs.
Before establishing an organization of innovative ideas, the leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and learning as an organization.
In 2006, Anghel explains Continuum as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
The neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical method of investigating learning ability. Therefore, it limits the field of research and makes it more precise.
Scientists in their research are advocating the connection between brain pathology and behavior.
It has been known for a very long time that various types of brain injuries, traumatic experiences, wounds, and unusual tumors affect behavior and can alter certain mental functions.
The increase in new technology has paved the way for us to see and examine the structures and processes of the brain that have not been seen before.
It provides us with a wealth of information and material to develop simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, it forms a very important branch of computer science, concerning the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Research in AI involves creating machines that automatically perform tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Included in the tasks of AI are control, planning and time allocation, the ability to answer reviews and customer questions, as well as recognizing human handwriting, voice, and face.
These kinds of things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is often used today in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, similar to what has been done in software applications for many home computers and video games.
The field trip is a major part of every classroom. Often, the teacher loves to take their students to places where traveling by bus is not an option.
Technology offers solutions through virtual educational tours. Students can look at artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing educational journeys virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year the students of Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, redesigning the website each year, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, this usually changes with having readers.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer began to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging "forces students to be smarter about the world around them." The need to capture the audience's interest incites students to be shrewd and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Writing a blog is a way that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning beyond the traditional school day.
The correct use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to materials on the Internet, students can identify their positions in the context of what others have written as well as formulate their own views on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming capital of Canada, bilingual and featuring many art galleries and museums showcasing the past and present of Canada.
In the far south is Niagara Falls, and to the north lies the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and many more feature Ontario as what can be considered Canadian by outsiders.
The vast areas in the north are sparsely populated, and some are almost deserted with no inhabitants.
For a comparison of population that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are citizens of Canada.
The islands in East Africa are in the Indian Ocean on the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest and can be considered a continent when discussing wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it became very important in Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence and colonialism of Europe began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The Sahel is at the border of the region to the north, and to the south and west is the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any women traveling say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It can also help to wear a ring (as long as it doesn't look too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences may result in what they consider as harassment and that it may be common to be followed, touched on the arm, etc.
Be strong in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand up (whether there are cultural differences or not, it is still unacceptable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The sultan from Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the places in the whole of Morocco that is not interesting to visit for shopping.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan items, such as tagines, clayware, leather goods, hookahs, and all kinds of trinkets, but all of these are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo located in its far east, adjacent to Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the town's roads, particularly in the town center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside Goma should be researched to understand the ongoing conflict situation in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo along with some of the most affordable mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The typical (local) fare is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
Included in its being difficult to reach, "Timbuktu" is now used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Currently, Timbuktu is an impoverished village, although its reputation is the reason for its popularity as a tourist destination, and it has an airfield.
In 1990, it was placed on the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat of desert sands.
This is one of the main destinations visited by Henry Louis Gates in his PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city is very different from all other cities in the country, as it is more Arab in style than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting diverse wildlife.
This is one of the main attractions of South Africa and it is considered the pride of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Just like all the National Parks of South Africa, there is a fee for daily conservation and park entry.
It may also be beneficial for a person to purchase a Wild Card, which will allow entry to selected parks in South Africa or to all of the National Parks of South Africa.
The island of Hong Kong is what gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place recognized by many tourists as the main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up the skyscraper view of Hong Kong has been likened to a glowing bar chart visible due to the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Most of the development of the cities of Hong Kong Island is on the reclaimed land on the northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonizers claimed as theirs, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world along the coastline, extending 80 km (50 mi) into the provinces of Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps — they include some of the last remaining hopes of the mighty forests that once covered the Ganga plains.
The Sundarbans cover 3,850 km², of which one-third is submerged in water/marshland areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wild animals, and it is estimated that there are now 409 Royal Bengal tigers and nearly 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses leave the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it's better to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are convenient and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (NU 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, it has a length of 378 meters and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The height of the space under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, once the construction of the Brazilian customs inspection stations is completed.
The Guaraní are the most important indigenous group living in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as somewhat nomadic hunters who also practiced agriculture for their livelihood.
The Chaco region became home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycura and Payagua, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies," was born as a result of the conflict between Spanish conquerors and groups of indigenous peoples.
The Spaniards began the period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain many of its indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is well-known for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
Smaller competitions and battles can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are commonly accepted anywhere on the islands, and credit cards are also frequently accepted in Stanley, as well as United States dollars.
In remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, even British and United States currency might be taken; check in advance with the owners to know what is a good method of payment.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a subtropical area; during the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can have deceptively chilly weather: temperatures rarely dip below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There is no specific "rainy season" and "dry season": the amount of rainfall remains almost the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, the wild animals, however, are fierce and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park managers said to stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how gentle they look, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, many visitors get injured because they fail to maintain the proper distance. These animals are large, fierce, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, it should be known that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking fragrant foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was established in the 1850s and became the official capital of Samoa starting in 1959.
The port is the famous site of a naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships sank, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the struggle for freedom organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in town resulted in the killing of the most important chief, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is situated between two harbors. The most popular ones are in three locations.
The beaches on the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and they stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of it is a sandy beach where it is safe to go into the water, with most of it shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded beaches visited by families and have a nice array of shops along the shore. It is safe to swim in the sea.
The primary local beer is 'Numero Uno', it is not a complicated beer, but rather pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that can be bought, but the wines from New Zealand and Australia may maintain good condition better during travel.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're afraid.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign. The short black is 'espresso', the cappuccino comes with a tall mound of cream (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is according to Belgian standards. The drinks made from fruit extract are expensive but very delicious.
English sentence: Many trips to the sea reef occur throughout the year, and damage caused by any reason related to the reef is rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, adhere to all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be seen outside these periods.
There are indeed sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively reside in the ocean; their primary habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind knowing that they have a place to sleep as soon as they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although it's possible for you to book a different type of accommodation, such as a campsite, through the travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, arranging transportation to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also keep the reservation for you if you need time to study the offer or handle other paperwork for your destination (e.g., visa).
Any changes or requests should be channeled through the travel agency representative and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of attendees at music festivals choose to camp on site, and most attendees consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, go early to secure accommodation near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages has ended, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music until the late hours of the night.
Some festivals have designated camping areas for families with young children.
When going to the Northern Baltic during winter, check the location of the sleeping area, as traveling on ice can cause quite a serious noise for those intentionally affected.
Sea voyages to Saint Petersburg require spending time in the city. Travelers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms).
Casinos typically make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by visitors. Windows and clocks are often absent, and exits may be difficult to find.
Usually, they have special offers for food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests feeling good and to keep them in the place.
Some places offer free alcohol. However, intoxication impairs decision-making ability, and every good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who will be driving at high altitudes or on mountain roads should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there isn't much traction and you can't drive as if you were just on asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow to stop you can fall in a very short time.
The ability to see falling or blowing snow or condensation or ice on the vehicle windows may also be limited.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic is not disrupted throughout the year.
The observation of animals or safaris is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to a journey overland to view the spectacular wildlife of Africa, particularly in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to cars, and ordinary equipment can provide a good viewing experience.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you will see them more often using binoculars.
The walking safari (also called "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "barefooting") involves hiking, which can last for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in different locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, having already hosted the games in 1964.
If you have already booked a flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
The event tickets are expected to range from ¥2,500 to ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help dry them. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board available, even if they are not in the room.
If there is no iron available, or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you have one.

The stretch of road between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, frequently passing through remote wooded areas.
If you are not used to driving on provincial roads, stay alert: the roads can be steep, narrow, and have sudden turns.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower compared to before and subsequent sections — usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and strict adherence to them is more important than not.
Surprisingly, however, mobile phone service here is stronger than along many other routes, e.g., the Forests of Pennsylvania.

With 17,000 island choices, Indonesian cuisine is a unifying term that encompasses a wide diversity of regional dishes found throughout the country.
However, when used without additional adjectives, the term usually refers to food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.

The stirrups on either side of the horse serve as support for the rider's feet.
These provide greater stability for the rider but may pose safety concerns due to the possibility that the rider's feet could get caught in them.
If a horseback rider is thrown off the horse but has one foot caught in the stirrup, they may get dragged if the horse runs. To reduce the risk, some precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with heels and smooth, narrow soles.
Next, some saddles, particularly the English ones, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to fall from the saddle if pulled backward by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - the top climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with various large granite walls and slopes.

Skiing is a major activity when traveling that many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," plan entire vacations centered around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old — cave paintings showing skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The sport of downhill skiing began around the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking through skiing: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
This is related but usually does not use alpine styles of touring or mountaineering with skis, because the latter are done on steep terrain and require stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the skiing route as a route similar to hiking.
Under good conditions, you can reach slightly farther distances than walking – but it is very rare to achieve the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on a groomed trail.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to many countries means having to go through visa applications and passport control several times.
The Schengen zone, however, operates in this aspect like a single country.
While you remain in this zone, you can cross borders without having to go through checkpoints for passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen member country, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no global definition of which made items are antiques. Some tax agencies define products over 100 years old as antiques.

Handmade products can be interpreted as antiques, even if they are newer than similar products made in bulk.
The care of reindeer is an important livelihood among the Sámi and the culture related to this occupation is also significant for many who have other jobs.

The strong waves are the backflow from the waves breaking on the shore, often on a rocky sea or reef or the like.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in some deeper parts, and a rapid flow of water can form there.
Most deaths occur from exhaustion while attempting to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back will not be any harder than normal.
Strive to reach a place where you are no longer carried away again or, depending on your abilities and if you have already been noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.

Sometimes travelers who easily adapt to a new culture find it even more difficult to readjust to their own native culture.
When returning to your own country after living abroad, you have gotten used to the new culture and some of your habits from your native culture have been lost.
When you first went to another country, people were likely patient and understanding because they knew that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.

The local telephone service provider is expected to provide additional information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular travel option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
It is extremely popular among school leavers, allowing them to take a gap year before college without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year course abroad can actually improve your chances of transferring to higher education in your own country.
Typically, there will be tuition fees to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a very beautiful destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, which are in the lakes and archipelagos along the coast.
In archipelagos and lakes, you won't always need a yacht.
Although the archipelagos near the mainland's coast and the largest lakes are truly large enough for any yacht, the small boats or even the kayak offer a unique experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
It is matched by Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but other than this it is truly exceptional (e.g., in the Netherlands, the number is one to forty).
Almost all of the exotic Baltic Cruises feature an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.

Delivery companies are paid well for the fast delivery of items. Often, time is crucial for business documents, goods, or parts needed for urgent repairs.
On other routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but on some routes and for smaller companies, there is a problem.
If they send the goods by air vehicles, it may take a few more days on another route before overcoming the unloading and taxation.
The only way for this to get through faster is by sending it as checked-in baggage. Airline regulations will not allow these to be sent without a passenger, and this is where you come in.
The easiest way to fly first class or business class is to pay a thick wad of cash for the privilege (or, even better, have your company do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: by standard estimates, expect to pay up to four times the usual economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no reason to look for discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines know very well that there are specific groups of travelers willing to pay top dollar for the privilege of reaching a place quickly and conveniently, and charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
