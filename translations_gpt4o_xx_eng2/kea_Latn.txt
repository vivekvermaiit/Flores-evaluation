This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that has already spread, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brown above with a pale underside or carotenoid-colored.
Discoveries also provide a vision on the evolution of wings.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a very developed shaft, called rachis, but have other feather characteristics — barbs and barbules — researchers deduce that the rachis was likely an evolutionary development subsequent to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather in temperature regulation or display. Investigators suggest that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not that of a juvenile.
Researchers suggest that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, it shows adult plumage and not that of a chick.

The completed work was mostly theoretical, but a program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
That effect that the team was looking for might be caused by tidal forces between dark matter in the galaxy and matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have managed to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory suggests that the majority of dark matter around a galaxy is located around a kind of halo, and it is made of many tiny particles.

Madhya Pradesh police recover stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya stated: "We have already arrested five individuals who assaulted the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Superintendent of police Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with a covered face.
Despite three people being inside the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been in custody since then at Edinburgh Sheriff Court accused of killing her son.
He is in custody awaiting accusation and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be tainted because his image has been widely published.
That is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice functions differently, and the court has considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, from the University of Dundee, observes, "it seems that journalists are walking a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc., of suspects."
Crown Office, which is generally responsible for judicial processes, told journalists that no further comments would be made, at least until an accusation is made.
Document, according to the information leak, refers to the border disputes, which Palestine claims based on the pre-1967 Middle East War borders.
Other topics allegedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan River border issue.
Israel will demand a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years when an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to allow this presence for only five years.
Shooters in the supplementary pest control trial should be closely supervised by forest guards, as the trial is accompanied and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited within the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Interim Director of Conservation and Heritage of the Park with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received detailed instructions and safety training.
Martelly yesterday installed a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
He was Martelly’s CEP for four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to lead the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protest that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were triggered due to the non-realization of elections, some of which were scheduled since 2011.
About 60 cases of defective iPods have been reported, which caused a total of six fires and left four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) stated that it had knowledge of 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported more than 34 overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responds calling the postponement of Apple's report "truly regrettable."
Earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
Emergency management office of the Northern Mariana Islands stated that no damage was reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there was no indication of a Tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shoots his M16 rifle at tourists.
Many hostages have already been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Several hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, along with those Filipino photographers.
Later, photographers took the place of an elderly lady, since she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was hit.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
He graduated as an obstetrician and started working at Auckland Maternity in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature birth during his free time.
If research shows that if given a hormone, it speeds up the fetal lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reports that government investigators recovered two flight recorders "black boxes" on Wednesday.
Fellow freedom fighters also pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said to me: “Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on a night with a full moon. Very unique like her. Strong woman.”
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels commented that “Luna was as exquisite as me...maybe even more...I love her and I miss her...I hope she is in a better place.”
Of the 1,400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal election, those who are against Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of participants in the survey share their opinion, but they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
According to the results of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
Olympic gold medalist should swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three Commonwealth Games settings, but due to complaints, their aptitude is in doubt.
He is not able to take the medicines he needs for his pain to go away, because those are forbidden in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and a computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number until now on January 25.
Many people verified that discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets could possibly have been a source of water supply to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists have hopes of understanding how planets form, especially how Earth formed, considering that comets have collided with Earth many times.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his governorship at the start of the decade and signed a law last month to legalize marriage between people of the same sex.
He referred to those rumors as "gossip and political nonsense."
It is speculated that he/she could run for presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to travel on shorter routes and save millions of liters of fuel per year and reduce carbon emissions.
He uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older land-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There are no other means of transport besides buses that go to Wembley and parking and stops are not available on the ground.
The risk of lack of transportation raises the possibility of the game being forced to take place behind closed doors without team supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reports the formation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in America and Uppsala University in Sweden report that a new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process had taken much longer, due to reproduction between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in all types of ways. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be stretched to make a thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled to make sheets.
It can be made very fine, and attached to another metal. It can be made so fine that sometimes it was used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
That is called the pH of a chemical product. It is possible to make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or basic the product is.
pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical substance.
Hydrogen ions are protons that lose their electron (since hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Wrap those two pieces together and then, with clean and damp hands, squeeze them into a ball.
That moisture in your hand reacts with the outside heat, which seems a bit strange and forms a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There was also sanitation in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, sanitation sometimes was part of public bathhouses where men and women would be together in the same place.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call and then it reflects it down again, almost immediately.
A satellite is sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use a telescope in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A giant rocket with more than 100 feet in height is needed to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has already changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is make transportation much easier and faster.
Bring us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Their diet consists mainly of medium-sized mammals, ranging from hares to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small feline predators (including feral domestic cats) that eat much smaller prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special job that each cat must prevent it from competing with others.
The lion is the most social feline that lives in large groups called prides.
The pack has one to three adult male family members, along with about thirty females and young.
Normally, women are closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and female offspring.
Packs of lions act a lot like packs of wolves or dogs, they are surprisingly similar to lions (but not like other big felines) in behavior, and also quite deadly to their prey.
Like a well-prepared athlete, a tiger can crawl (but not in a straight line), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times more strength than a strong human being.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not a full-bodied roar like that of a lion; it is more like a sentence of words growled and shouted.
Jaguars like to eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost every animal that a jaguar hunts is much smaller than it.
Scientists find that ocelots track and locate animals to eat (prey) through scent, from sniffing where they were on the ground.
They can see very well at dusk and at night, and move very stealthily, too. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their environment and then jumping on their prey.
Over time, when a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they came (like if they go to the top of a mountain range or a river, or if they go to a new island thus making it difficult for them to return), they often find themselves in a different environment from what they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than those that existed before.
Original population does not change at all, nor does it need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, they start to resemble other populations less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations have such a different appearance that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, expel).
Plants make their food in the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses with plants and we make our clothes with plants. The majority of the foods we eat are plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it was not afraid of anything, except other mosasaurs.
If the purchased jaw was equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with a rare combination in the roof of its mouth, it meant that nothing that passed through its path could escape.
We are not sure, but it might have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it might have been a cannibal.
Also, it attacks anything that enters the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex could not compete with it.
Although most of their food seems familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor people and that woman ate food sitting on a chair, the rich men liked to have a banquet together where they would recline while having their meals.
The ancient Roman diet could not have included food that came from America or Asia to Europe in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had tasted turkey.
Babylonians constructed one of their gods' temples which is considered the home of gods.
People used to make sacrifices for the gods and priests would try to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then a sanctuary inside that only priests could enter.
Ziggurats, sometimes specially shaped like a pyramid, are constructed to be part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for that god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, that house was not very important.
Most of the life of a Hebrew family happens outdoors.
Women used to cook in the yard; stores were just counters facing the street. Stone was used for building houses.
There are no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was colonized very little. In Norse sagas, they say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for homicide, and upon traveling west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, the Taino tribes were already living there at that time.
Although all the countries were "Scandinavian," there were many differences among the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have already seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Despite there being something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written in the original Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". That text appears at the bottom part of the document, from top to bottom.
Despite no one knowing for sure who wrote it, it's known that, at the beginning of its life, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that the note was simply created as a label.
Disembarkations of D-Day and subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was governed by the French "Vichy". These were the French who had made peace with Germany in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of waging war against them.
On August 15, 1944, the Allies invaded the south of France, that invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and French Free forces liberated southern France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a large significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and which also defines, in some way, the dimension of society.
Cities-States are precursors of nations. A civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge through various generations, a comprehensive cultural heritage, and a fair dissemination.
Cultures often disappear many times without leaving historically relevant evidence and they cannot be recognized as an adequate civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed their first central government—a confederation with Congress as its sole component—according to the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, as there was no national executive or judiciary, it depended on the state authorities, which often did not cooperate, to enforce all its actions.
Also, he had no authority to annul laws and fiscal tariffs within the state.
These Articles require unanimous consent of all the States before they can be amended and the states do not establish a central government in such a way that their representatives were almost always absent.
Italian national football, together with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and they were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water volleyball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motorcycle racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago."
The origin of Taiwan began from the 15th century, where European sailors passing by the island recorded its name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southeast of Taiwan, initiating a transformation in indigenous cereal production practices and employing Chinese workers in their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal areas of the west and north of Taiwan and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, where it ceded the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three great structures, namely Intihuatana, Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edge of the complex were reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and that restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common fixed image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
Even today it is produced, but, more importantly still, its aspect relation was inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
That 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusing, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
Ratio of aspect of this format (divided by twelve to achieve the simplest integer ratio) is, therefore, referred to as 3:2.
Formatted mountain like (APS family of formats, for example) is the same or very close to the aspect ratio.
That often abused and ridiculed rule of thirds is just a simple guideline that creates dynamism, and at the same time maintains a measure of order in an image.
He claims that the most effective place for the main subject is the intersection of the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had already become rich and powerful, became subject to control.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion united European countries despite differences in language and customs.
If the omnipresent power can affect everyone, from king to commoner.
One of the main principles of Christ is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money leads many people to question whether these principles were being fulfilled.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proves to be effective, cutting vital military and civilian supplies, despite these blockades violating generally accepted international law, codified by many international agreements of the last two centuries.
Great Britain mines international waters to prevent the entry of any ships in all sections of the ocean, and ends up putting even neutral ships in danger.
As a response to this limited tactic, Germany was expecting a similar answer to build its submarines without restrictions.
During the 1920s, the predominant attitude of most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations desired to avoid a situation of that kind again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in America with 4 cents on him, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different periods of time; each stage of China or each ruling family was a different dynasty.
Also, within each dynasty, there was one that was unstable with divided provinces. The most known of this period was the time of the Three Kingdoms, which occurred during 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During this period, there were violent wars among many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China, thousands of people died fighting to sit in the highest place of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a change from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, positions were open to all male candidates to allow the most ambitious and successful ones to succeed.
The same applies to troops because instead of troop ranks being based on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the worldly life. He would frequently visit a cave known as "Hira" on the "Noor" (light) Mountain for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived for a long time, gives a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
Situated on one of the northern mountains of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In truth, finding it is not easy, even knowing that it exists. Once you are inside the cave, it is total isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the clear and beautiful sky from above and the surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Constructed for the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramidal structures built to honor deceased Pharaohs.
Giza Plateau, or “Necropolis of Giza” in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, has many pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), many small tombs, many temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Khufu's wife and family members.
The "upward arc" sign looks like a V and the "downward arc" sign looks like a staple or a square without its bottom side.
On the up means you should start at the end and pull the bow, and on the down means you should start in the middle (where your hand holds the bow) and draw the bow.
An upward bow generally produces a softer sound, while a downward bow is stronger and more assertive.
You are free to add your marks with a pencil, but remember that the printed score markings are there for a musical reason, so generally they should be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, four years old), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, all in fear, were forced by a mob of market women back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
In carriages, they travel back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and threatening against the King and Queen.
Many people force the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage open.
In a certain moment, a member of the crowd waved the head of a dead royal guard in Versailles, in front of the terrified queen.
Parts of the war of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the expenses and interest on floating obligations in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
It is clear, these superprofits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constitute basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
That period when those events occurred is generally called the High Middle Ages, that period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 A.D.).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological impetus or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and the manifestation of technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, for its part, has “effects” on society that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that automobiles necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable with only a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The increase in cars and also driving leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which results in the invention of new techniques in healthcare for the repair of damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes individuals, and over time customs and culture arise related to this geography, and those, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital in the contemporary world, Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
If its status declined during the 12th century, it was mainly because the Crusades brought back goods like silks and spices, which were more valued than what the Byzantine markets were offering.
It was at that time that the title of Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak during the period between the 10th - 11th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, clothing was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of the communication channels, styles in the West may fall behind by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments of the era, as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture practiced to produce sufficient food to meet only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, that uses native seeds from the region stored together with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, the majority of farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with the same mindset who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be different because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subculture often signal themselves through a distinct and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and color.
One of the most common methods used to describe the importance of socialization is to take advantage of the few unfortunate cases of children who, through negligence, misfortune, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults while they were growing up.
These types of children are called "feral" or "wild." Some feral children have been confined by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of these children happens due to the parents’ rejection of the severity of the child's intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may have suffered abuse or serious traumas before being abandoned or running away.
Others are allegedly raised for animals; some say they live in the wild on their own account.
When a place is completely created for non-human animals, wild children exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of a particular pet, such as their fear or indifference towards living beings.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, assistance is taking a step forward.
Assistance is not a learning method, but rather a support that provides help to individuals who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a software program or starting a new project.
Assistance can be both virtual and real, meaning a professor is a form of assistance, but that paperclip guy in Microsoft Office is as well.
The Virtual Assistant is embedded in the software and serves to ask, suggest, and explain procedures that might have been a challenge for a student to deal with on their own.
Children can be placed in Foster Care for many reasons, ranging from neglect, abuse, and even abandonment.
Children do not get lost, they must be raised in an environment that is welcoming, caring, and educational, but they do grow up.
We realize that Family Reception Systems are a safe zone for these children.
Our family foster systems must provide a secure home, loving care, stable education, and reliable health care.
Family foster care should meet all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they came.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
Distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to more dimensions in terms of uses and approaches to gratification.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and continuity of relationship were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reasons for websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to know if someone is lying through correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech," indicates how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nonetheless able to evaluate sincerity and emotional tone.
He even suggests that these abilities in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals like domestic dogs.
Studies of the 20th century have already shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: recessive and expressed.
Mutation increases new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the expressed variation pool.
Segregation and recombination hinder variation back and forth between those two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to humans to satisfy its amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
Translate that, if it is not achieved, it has grave consequences: lack of growth, malnutrition, and even death.
Vegetable resources more easily accessible tend to serve accessible proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they also provide high amounts of protein that contain all essential amino acids.
When everything ends, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their “protein problem” in the same way savannah chimpanzees do today.
Interruption of sleep is the process of waking up intentionally during your normal sleep period and going back to sleep a short time afterward (10-60 minutes).
That can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to make you aware without completely waking you up.
If you realize that you tend to reset your alarm clock during sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get up and turn it off.
Other options based on the biorhythm include drinking plenty of liquids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleeping, which forces someone to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positively vital force appears. Everyone has the potential to find peace and absolute contentment.
Every person can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has expanded to the Mahayana path of love and to many techniques of Indian Yoga.
The basic principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of complete love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The Tibetan mediation center is the Yoga of Divinity. Through the visualization of many divinities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and awareness of light is created.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and America. With the end of the war, system, process, and cultural confrontations led to the decline of countries.
With the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last 40 years and be fought seriously, for the representation of success, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
Around September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already destroyed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, this plan became almost obsolete overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for transporting goods is undoubtedly the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
Work of the Navy has always been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, it interferes with the ability of your enemy to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. Americans were trying to transport men and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was using more U-shaped boats, trying to stop this movement.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have managed to conquer Great Britain as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to create paths to facilitate access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept on farms that would go into the mountains and other grazing areas, often herded by goat herders who were often children or adolescents, like those more well-known cattle herders. These livestock raising methods are still used today.
Carriages built in England came in the early 16th century.
Although those carriages were made only of wooden planks side by side, the horses managed to pull them to reach higher speeds and pull much heavier loads than on roads slightly rougher than today.
Roundabouts were introduced quite early to maintain trails in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that tracks would serve more efficiently if they had an iron framework on top.
That has become common practice, but iron causes more discomfort in the set of wagon wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first complete iron carts were introduced.
The first known form of transportation was walking, humans started walking about two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestor, Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Specialization of two legs is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists, to reduce future suffering to a certain extent.
That is exactly like a symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we do not just want a temporary solution, then we should look for the root of the problem and deactivate them.
It is quite obvious that the world has already changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity, and problems have become more numerous due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten proposal signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to the printing office of John Dunlap, just a few quarters of a distance away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as “Borda largu”.
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
An order for George Washington on July 6th, which he sent to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 copies of Dunlap broadsides that are still known are the earliest surviving copies of that document. The original manuscript copy no longer survives.
Today, paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they fly.
There are still many things about birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Practically all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number has only one of two values, that is, 0 or 1, and this number is referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are generally not sufficient for an immediate diagnosis to be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of something like an open medicine container or toxic domestic chemical products.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this specific poison.
That term "insetu" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both of them, I perceive Assassin as I perceive Kama, they are hummingbirds, adapted to living in nests or in the houses of whomever they court.
In America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which makes it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Investigations have already discovered that females are twice as likely to have MS than males.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or that of their children, to raise a baby.
They can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can take care of the child.
The principal objective of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method of fact-finding guides most scientific investigations.
But it is not just that, experimentation and an experience is a test that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and also make observations to guide scientific investigation.
Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts and, in particular, the Bible in Latin.
He accepted all of Aristotle's opinions on all matters of science, including psychology.
When the knowledge of Greek fell, the West became isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
The observed rhythmic patterns in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic suggestions, have been documented in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that continues a period of free-running operation, even in the presence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments marking the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected pieces of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of appreciating landscapes, including fauna and flora.
Additional activities on the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks to study and learn about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, taking photos, and learning about orangutans in Borno.
Every morning, people leave the outskirts by car to go to their workplaces and they pass by other people whose work destination is where they just came from.
In this coming and going of dynamic transport, everyone is in some way connected to a transport system based on private cars, which supports them.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has already displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you almost do not hear similar levels of complaints about the quality of water or bridges collapsing.
Because transportation systems generate these types of complaints, because they fail every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of vehicle drivers between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, I can't assist with that request.
Ultimately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be more or less represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships are established among the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, concession, and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helps them escape predators more quickly and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back over their bodies.
That gives them a greater variety of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many others believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems to make sense, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes with more than six miles in width.
A complete percentage of 20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers to the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids with stone continued until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their dimensions and the technical excellence of their construction.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were over a thousand years old at the time.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also a language commonly used by most of those who work for the State, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they can all be found in nature in their native form and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
That was more like these four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it also theorizes that they transform into new substances to form things that we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. And of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit on the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, a pencil was a good friend to many people when it came.
Initially, as new writing methods emerged, pencils have been relegated to status and lower uses.
People now write messages on the computer screen without ever having to get close to a desk.
We can only ask what will happen to the keyboard when something newer emerges.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It is like rolling a crushed car up a mountain. Split the nucleus again, and then release part of this energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they tend to decay with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
He is slimmer below a maria and bigger on high land.
There can be more seaweed on the closer side because the crust is thinner. It was easier to wash onto the surface.
Theories of content are focused on discovering what makes people awakened or attracted to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories analyze what must make someone want to do the things they want and what things in their environment make it possible or not possible to do certain things.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge as managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is to try to continue as "one of those friends."
This type of manager has difficulties in making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, and assigning responsibility to people.
On the other side of the spectrum, someone transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that they must change everything that has been done and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often results in conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are maintained to the same standard of excellence as conventional teams, but there is a slight difference.
Members of the virtual team often function as a point of contact for your immediate physical group.
They have much more autonomy than the conventional team members, since their teams can meet according to flexible schedules that may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"Invisible team" is the management team to which each member is accountable. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why does an organization want to go through the prolonged process of creating a learning organization? One of the objectives of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized through the functional departments of an organization, creativity and commitment can emerge.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome obstacles can lead to a new innovative process to serve the needs of clients.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, and also share knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006), explains the Continuum approach as a method that is being used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data presents physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research. Therefore, it reduces the area of research and makes it more focused.
Correlation between cerebral pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
Already known for a long time that different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause alterations in some mental functions.
The rise of new technology allows us to see and investigate structures and processes that have never been seen before.
That provides us with a lot of informational material to construct simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Despite AI having a strong scientific connotation, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science that deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
Investigation about AI involves figuring out how machines automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Izénplus includes control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer inquiries, and also handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These things have already become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now being used extensively in areas of the economy, medicine, engineering, and military, as it has become available in many home computers and video game software.
A study visit is a large part of any class. Many times a teacher would like to take their students to a place where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers solutions with virtual study visits. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art as if they were sitting with their class.
Sharing a study visit is also an excellent way to reflect on a trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, every year that website is remodeled, but previous versions are kept online to serve as a memory album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students start their blogging experience with dyslexic grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are almost always the most critical audience, the blog writer began to strive to improve their writing in order to avoid criticisms.
Also, blogging "forces students to have more knowledge about the world around them." The need to feed public interest inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs “can empower students to be more analytical and critical; through active responses to online material, students can define their positions in the context of others' writings, as well as outline their own perspectives on particular issues” (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming and bilingual capital of Canada and presents a variety of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and to the north is the unexplored natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things stand out Ontario as something that is considered purely Canadian by people from outside.
Large areas further to the north are very sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited deserts.
For a population comparison, that surprises many people: There are more African Americans living in America than Canadian citizens.
Those islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest distant land, and a continent only when it comes to avoiding wild affairs.
Most of those smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as luxury beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it had a great influence on Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Woman: It is recommended for any traveling woman to say that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It helps a lot to also use a ring (but not the one that seems too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they may consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Stand firm in saying no, and don't be afraid to keep firm (cultural differences or not, that doesn't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century A.D., and it was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city like Daru al-Baida and named it Casablanca for the Spanish merchants who established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
The old Medina's vicinity makes it easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, like tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and all types of trinkets, but all that is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano that covered most of the city's streets, particularly the city center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma should be researched to understand the ongoing war situation in the North Kivu province.
That city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, along with some of the cheapest trackers of mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal local price is about 500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Together with its relative inaccessibility, “Timbuktu” comes to be used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS Special Wonders of the African World.
That city is in strong contrast with the rest of the cities in the country because it has a more Arabic touch than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends to the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
That park has 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different wildlife.
He is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered a flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all National Parks of South Africa, there are daily conservation and park entrance fees.
It can also be good to buy a Passport Ticket, which allows entrance either into a selection of parks in South Africa or into all National Parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is a place where many tourists consider as the main focus.
The skyline of Hong Kong's buildings has been compared to a bar graph of twinkling lights that is reflected by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely populated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
That is the place where the British colonizers took as their own, and if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, that is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) into the Indian interior from the coast.
Sundarbans has already been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not just mangrove swamps — they include some of the last settlements remaining from the great jungles that once covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which about one third is covered by water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave the interstate bus terminal during the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Interdistrict buses are almost always full, so it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable means of traveling to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges in French Guiana.
These two towers stand at a height of 83 meters, have a length of 378 meters, and two lanes 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance below the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was only opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, but it is expected for the Brazilian customs checkpoint to be completed.
Guarani was the most significant indigenous group that lived in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once called the "Giant Province of the Indies", emerged as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since its foundation as Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known because it has one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will take place in December at the Las Cañitas Polo Field.
Tournaments and smaller games can also be seen here in other seasons of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo games, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), its value is equivalent to a British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands which is located in Stanley, in front of the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and Stanley credit cards and American dollars are also usually accepted.
In the peripheral islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, although they may take British and American currency; check with the owners beforehand to know which method of payment is accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the island.
Montevideo is located south of the Equator, where it is summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make you feel colder than what the thermometer shows.
There is no specific "rainy" season and "dry" season: the amount of rain remains the same throughout the whole year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wildlife is, nonetheless, wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters from any other wild animal!
No matter how tame they seem, bison, deer, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they do not maintain an adequate distance. This animal is large, fierce, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Beyond that, remember that aroma attracts bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
That port was the site of a terrible naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, America, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships sank except that one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the MAU movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the death of supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because of the location of two harbors in Auckland. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
Beaches of the sea on the north coast (in the district of North Harbour) are located in the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay, in the north, to Devonport, in the south.
They are mostly sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the high-quality suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in the center of Auckland.
Those there are sometimes beach of sea of families crowded with a good variety of shops lined on the edge. Nothing is certain.
The main local beer is "Number One," it's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines to drink, but wines from New Zealand and Australia can travel better.
Tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you have concerns.
To Australians, the idea of "white coffee" is foreign. A short black is "espresso," cappuccino comes full of cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
That dark chocolate is in line with Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
They make many trips to Recife throughout the whole year, and the reason for any of these trips to Recife is rare.
Still, accept advice from authorities, obey all signals, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Jellyfish occur near the sea and river estuaries, from October to April in the north of 1770. They can sometimes be found outside these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and they swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their main habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance reservation gives travelers the peace of mind of having a place to sleep when they reach their destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with some hotels, although it is also possible to book other types of accommodation, like camping spots, through a travel agency.
Travel agents generally offer packages that include breakfast, airport transport arrangements, or even flight and hotel packages all together.
They can also keep your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to find other documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any changes or requests should first be directed through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the large number of participants who go to the music festival decide to camp at the venue, and most participants consider it a vital part of their experience.
If you want to be close to the stage, you have to arrive earlier to get a spot close to the music.
Although the music on the main stages may be over, there may be festival sessions that continue playing music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are going to cross the North Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, because crossing ice makes a terrible noise for those most affected.
Cruises in Saint Petersburg include a stay in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see terms).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by visitors. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
Normally, they have special offers of food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and keep them at the establishment.
Some places offer alcoholic drinks on the house. However, being drunk impairs judgment, and every good player knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive at high altitudes or pass over mountains should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, traction is low and you can't drive like you do on normal asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall to trap you for a short time.
Visibility can also be limited by snowfall or snow drift or by condensation or frost on car windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and transit continues almost always without interruption throughout the entire year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and stand out to many visitors.
That term "safari" in popular use refers to a land journey to see the stunning African wildlife, particularly in the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach close to the vehicle and equipment, allowing for good visualization.
Lions, hyenas and leopards are sometimes shy and you observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "walking safari," or "going on foot") consists of walks that can last for a few hours or many days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other places throughout Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you reserved your plane tickets and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could find yourself in a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies are expected to remain in place until July 2020, when the Olympic Games are scheduled.
I expect that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Liza's wrinkled clothes can help iron out. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board ready to lend, even if they are not present in the room.
If an iron isn't available, or if you don't like using ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer, if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burns).
There are different forms of water purification, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, in others several minutes are necessary.
Filters vary according to effectiveness, and if there are any concerns, then you should consider buying your sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in their region of origin.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in extreme cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Actually, those infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can harm or kill someone by force are usually not classified as pests.
Purchasing duty-free goods is an opportunity to buy goods without taxes and special consumption taxes in a specific place.
Travelers heading to countries with heavy taxes can sometimes save a good amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
Road between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which passes through many isolated forest areas.
If you are not used to driving on the roads abroad, be careful: there are many steep descents, narrow lanes, and tight curves.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to these is even more important than otherwise.
Curiously, however, mobile service is much stronger here than in many parts of the road, for example, Pennsylvania Wilds.
The pastry shop Alemon is very good, and in Bavaria, it is very rich and varied, like that of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit desserts are common, like apple pie throughout the year, and cherry and plum tarts appearing during the summer.

With 17,000 islands to explore, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But, if used without more qualifiers, that term tends to mean food originally from the central part of the main island, Java.
Now available for all homes throughout the archipelago, the Javanese cuisine presents a variety of simply seasoned dishes, where the predominant flavors preferred by the Javanese are peanuts, palm sugar, sugar (especially Javanese palm sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the horse's foot that are attached on each side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but they can have safety issues due to the chance of a rider’s foot getting stuck in them.
If a rider falls off a horse but has a foot stuck in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse starts running. To minimize this risk, a set of safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, most of the men wear mountain boots with heels and smooth soles, very tight.
Later, some saddles, particularly those English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup to release from the saddle if pulled backward by a falling rider.
Valley of Cochamó - main climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cracks.

Winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding on snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings representing skiers date back to 5000 B.C.!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was inaugurated by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski adventurers: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski excursions, or ski hiking.
It is related, but usually does not involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter taking place on inclined terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski track like a hiking trail through the wilderness.
In good conditions you can cover distances a little farther than walking - but very rarely will you achieve skiing speeds for crossing a country without a backpack weighted on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to many countries means that you have to go through many visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen area, however, functions somewhat like a single country in this regard.
Happy to stay in this area, generally you can cross the border without going through passport control points again.
Likewise, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each of the Schengen member countries, which saves you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition regarding what manufactured article is an antique. Some tax agencies define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
That definition has geographical variations, where the age limit can be shorter in places like America than in Europe.
Artisanal products can be considered antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important means of subsistence among the Sámi, and the trade culture around it is also important for other people with other professions.
Even traditionally, although not all Sami have been involved in large-scale agriculture, they lived by fishing, hunting, and similar activities, with reindeer mainly as a means of transportation.
Today, many Sami work in modern offices. Tourism is an important income in Sápmi, the region of the Sami.

A course usually lasts 2-5 days and involves dramatization, a lot of first aid training and, sometimes, weapons training.
Books and magazines that talk about survival in the wilderness are common, but publications that talk about war zones are few.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they carry valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with an unspecified gender (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender varies.
Your request for foreign governments to honor these documents is also variable.
Searches at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the era after September 11, 2001.
Pre-operative transgender individuals should not have to wait to pass through the scanner without compromising their privacy and dignity.
The currents of rupture are the return flow of waves that break in the sea, often in a reef or a certain place.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections, and a rapid current to the deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion in trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
Without the power, nothing about returning is more difficult than usual.
Try to reach a place where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your ability and having been noticed, you might want to hope for a rescue.
The shock of reentry happens sooner than cultural shock (it has fewer honeymoon phases), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who experience an easy adaptation to a new culture sometimes have a particular difficulty in readjusting to their native culture.
When you return to your homeland after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost habits from your original culture.
When you go abroad initially, people are probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People cannot anticipate that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning to their homes.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the background, and you can watch them in silence before the show begins.
Normally, you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is placed as a backdrop and a narrator of a long story.
Scenes unfold at pyramids and the different pyramids light up.
South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by many nations and have the highest number of bases, with seventeen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest is the Island of King George with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region in the south of the Peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Mountains of the Peninsula here bend on the plateau, then turn to form the 360 km Ellsworth Mountains chain, divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with a peak of 4892 m at Mount Vinson.
In remote places, without mobile network coverage, a satellite phone can be your only option.
A satellite phone is not generally a substitute for a mobile phone, since it needs to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
That service is often used for transportation, including leisure crafts, as well as expeditions that require data and voice at a distance.
Your local telephone service operator should provide more information about connecting to this service.
An option increasingly more popular for those considering a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
That is especially popular among those who are taking a gap year, allowing them to take a year off before college without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a one-year "sabbatical" course abroad can actually improve your chances of returning to attend higher education in your country of origin.
Generally, there is a registration fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination to travel by boat. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in lakes and in archipelagos along the coast.
In archipelagos and in lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the archipelagos on the coast and the larger lakes are sufficiently large for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
That is similar to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the number is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises have a prolonged stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit that historic city for a few days while you return and sleep on the boat at night.
If you only travel on a cruise excursion, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises are advertised in Berlin, Germany, in brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not a place near the sea, and a view of the city is not included in the cruise price list.

Rapid courier companies are well paid because they deliver things quickly. Many times, time is very important for commercial documents, goods, or urgent repair parts.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and for smaller companies, there is a problem.
If they sent things by air freight, on some routes it could take days to clear customs and be unloaded.
The only way to make it go faster was to send it as checked luggage. Airline regulations do not allow them to send luggage without a passenger, which is where you come in.
The obvious way to travel first class or business class is to pay a lot of money for that privilege (or, better yet, get your company to pay for it).
However, that doesn't come cheap: as a more or less general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy class fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally speaking, it's not worth looking for discounts for executive or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain central group of passengers who are willing to pay a good price for the privilege of arriving at a place quickly and comfortably, and charge as should be.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is used everywhere.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.

Please treat that place with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface that place through markings or scratches with graffiti on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.

Regular announcements on the Metro are only made in Catalan, but unscheduled interruptions are made by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.

The brusque appearance of Parisians evaporates quickly if you display some basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park has many forests, mainly with trees like beech, fir, and pines, and it has a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
There is a great variety of plant communities, due to their variety of microclimates, different soils, and variable altitude levels.

Fauna rare like the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, vulture, lynx, wild cat, and grouse can be found there, along with many more common species.
During visits to religious sites, women are required to wear a skirt that covers their knees and also covers their shoulders.
Most of the time, they give cloaks to those women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially in a light color, you receive a smile from the nun or brother at the entrance.
In the same vein, men are required to wear pants that cover the knees.
That can also be borrowed from stock upon entry, but the clothes are not washed after each person uses them, so you might not feel comfortable using these skirts. One size fits all for men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in everything.

Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete nowadays, and they end up becoming museums or places of learning.
As light pollution in its highest form is not typically the kind of problem that it is nowadays, it is usually localized in cities or on university campuses, where it is easier to reach than those built in modern times.
The majority of modern research telescopes are large installations located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Observe the cherry blossom, known as hanami, which has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
That concept comes from China, where plum blossoms were the preferred flowers.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor only for him and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants are in their best form when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to pick even "just one" sample.

Traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with the congregation frequently attending celebrations around midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
Every animal that comes to the islands for the first time either swims, flies, or floats.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galápagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galápagos, many mammals were introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic zones in winter, you experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
