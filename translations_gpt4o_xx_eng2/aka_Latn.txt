The pH of the 'cabbage juice' indicates whether it is 'acidic' or 'basic' (alkaline).
The number of ‘Hydrogen ions’ present in the substance indicates its ‘pH level’ (the H in pH).
‘Hydrogen ions’ are ‘protons’ that have lost their ‘electrons’ (because ‘Hydrogen atoms’ hold one ‘Proton’ and one ‘electron’).

When you call someone who is very far from you by thousands of miles, you are using a 'satellite'.
This satellite in the sky receives a signal first and then transmits it back to earth instantaneously.
They used the instrument that we send into the sky called a 'satellite' to go up. Astronomers use a 'telescope' to work in space because the atmospheric changes prevent us from seeing the stars and their brightness clearly.
Before a device that can observe space very well, like a satellite or a telescope, can be launched into space, it must ascend about 100 miles.
Cars have changed many things in this world in many ways. The most beneficial change that cars have brought about is that they have made our journeys less tiring and faster.

Ocelots often eat small animals. If they can, they catch rodents, reptiles, amphibians, and birds. All the animals that an ocelot catches are smaller than it.
Wise creatures in the forest think that the 'ocelot' uses its skin patterns to attract animals for it to feed on.
They see something very late at night and then walk on a path that others do not know about. The path that the ocelot uses to trap animals means they mingle with where they are and camouflage the animals.
If small groups of living things (of a certain few) become separated from the larger group they originated from (for example, if they go to a certain hill or by a river or travel to a new place where they can't easily return), very often the place they have reached will become a new place for them.
In this new place, there are things and people who will demand fresh adjustments, so they will need to reinvent themselves to be able to interact with others better than they did before.
Their numbers have not changed at all; they still need things just as they did before.
Later, when the new group finds a place to settle, they begin to change the location of many of the groups.
Now, even after thousands of years, these two groups cannot be said to be the same if they transform completely.
This thing we call ‘speciation’ means that a new group has been formed. ‘Speciation’ is something that is difficult to predict, and it is very good for adaptation or results in changes.
Trees generate the air that people breathe in, and they absorb the air that people exhale outdoors (meaning, when they exhale outdoors).

The word 'civilization' comes from Latin 'civilis', meaning 'civil', which is related to 'Latin civis' denoting 'citizen', and 'civitas', signifying 'city or city-state', and it can also refer to the larger community.
The 'city-states' are the nations themselves. Original traditions show that they are presenting certain knowledge that distorts the truth and confuses the next generation.
Small traditions can be lost when there is no history available, so they are not seen as significant.
During the Revolutionary War era, the thirteen states formed a weak government—one that was governed solely by Congress—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no authority to impose taxes on the people, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, the state authorities also assisted it.
And there is no power that can do anything concerning the law that governs the relationship between the states.
The Articles needed to be accepted by all the people before they could change them, but because the states did not consider the issue of the central government to be a matter at all, even their representatives went there.

In this period in European history, the Roman Church, which had gained wealth and power, was under significant scrutiny.
It is now over a thousand years since Christianity got integrated into European culture despite their language and changing customs.
His authority is acknowledged and has had an impact on all the kings and their subjects.
The main teaching of Christianity is that we should dedicate money to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church collection box exists for this very reason.

The aircraft was shot down behind the radar, prompting the British to start blocking the Germans' way so they could not send any ship with people or goods into the country.
The method they used worked very well, and it even covered both soldiers and civilians with the essential items they needed, regardless of the international laws that had been established two hundred years earlier.

The method of ‘subsistence farming’ is outdated; they rarely use pesticides, and the way they plant and store the crops has not changed, yet they use unsuitable techniques with other things to increase the crop yield.
History shows that most farmers practiced 'subsistence agriculture,' which is still prevalent in many developing countries.

The 'subculture' group of children adopts elements and ways such as fashions, mannerisms, and argot and incorporates them.
One of the ways used to emphasize the importance of 'socialization' is that they take examples of children who had a failed upbringing, children who were neglected, did not have proper guidance, experienced mistreatment, and were not guided by elders during their growth period.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some people (often their parents) keep these 'feral children' indoors; sometimes, these children are abandoned due to the mental or physical challenges their parents face.
It is possible that these 'feral' children have either experienced something that startles them before fleeing or escaping.
It is said that some were raised by animals; others have simply lived in the wild.
English sentence: If only animals raised him, the wild animal will exhibit a certain behavior (involving the body) that is different from another animal that raised him, such as being fearful of humans or special in a way that he does not recognize the relationship between him and humans.
English sentence: When it is necessary for learning which stands independently to be supported, scaffolding is added to it.
The sentence in Akan translates to English as: "'Scaffolding' is not a method of learning but rather a way that helps those learning something new, such as using new computer software or starting something new."
Scaffolds can be like 'what we are looking at and what is there', when we are introducing a new method, the instructor is a 'scaffold' and also the 'paperclip little man' in Microsoft Office is one.
They have integrated the 'Virtual Scaffolds' into the software to ensure it creates inquiries, stretches thinking, demonstrates methods for undertaking tasks that students alone cannot accomplish.
The reason children engage in various activities ranging from fetching items from the sea to crafts, including earning through work, is to make a living.
There is no way children can grow in a place where they are not taken care of, not well nurtured, or where there is no education, yet it continues.
We consider the 'Foster Care System' as a place where these children are given a home.
The 'foster care system' should provide the children with a safe place with caregivers who care for them, education, and good health.
The 'foster care' must provide them with something they didn't have at the place from which they were taken.
The internet involves a vast number of things and direct communication.
The internet is one thing that reveals things and draws us into a new perspective, teaching us how to create something or how to efficiently manage something.
Example, studies indicate that “education” and “accessibility” are crucial motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Translation: “Personal connection” and “continuing relationships” were concepts that Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified as important motivators in their research concerning community discourse on commercial websites.

Twentieth century research indicates that there are two types of genetic variation: the hidden and the visible.

On the savanna, it is difficult for a certain primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to obtain the amino acids it needs from leaves or trees.
Another thing is that if you do not get this item, it causes the loss of its growth which can result in death.
Trees or leaves that can be very beneficial are leaves and legumes that contain 'protein' but it is difficult for primates like us unless we cook it well.
However, some animal foods such as (eggs, insects, fish) not only can be easily digested but also contain a lot of protein which is rich in amino acids.
If everything is fine, let it not surprise us that our ancestors followed this same path to gain the advantage of the "protein diet" just as the chimps do on the savanna today.

During World War II, Germany was a major enemy, which caused the USSR and the USA to ally. After the war ended, the "plans, procedures, and events" that took place brought the nations to understand each other.
Two years after the war ended, the nations that had allied themselves became enemies and started the period called the 'Cold War'.
