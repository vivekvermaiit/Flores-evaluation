Despite the fact that one of the vaccines, which is in the experimental stage, may prove to be capable of reducing the mortality rate from Ebola fever, so far not a single drug has definitively demonstrated its suitability for treating the infection that already exists.
Initially, one of the antibody cocktails, ZMapp, seemed promising in this area, but official studies demonstrated less benefit from it than was necessary to prevent death.
During the PALM clinical trials, the drug Zmapp was used as a control. This means it was used as a benchmark to compare with the other three drugs.

This not only confirms the popular theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides information that is usually unattainable when studying fossils, such as the color and three-dimensional spatial arrangement of the feathers.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were chestnut-brown on top and had a pale or red-yellow hue on the underside.
This discovery allows for a better understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
Due to the fact that dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft — rachis, but have other feather features — barbs and barbules, researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a late evolutionary change compared to the other features.
Judging by the structure of the feather, one can conclude that it was used not for flight, but rather to regulate temperature or attract attention. Researchers have assumed that even contrary to it being the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows not the down of a chick, but the mature plumage.
Researchers admit that, although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen may show the plumage of an adult animal rather than downy chick feathers.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in the KwaZulu-Natal region of the Republic of South Africa.
Once he stated in an interview that the new variant "causes significant concern and anxiety, as it is characterized by a very high mortality rate."
Dr. Mol believes that a number of patients may have contracted the disease in the hospital, and at least two of those infected were hospital staff.
An infected person can infect from 10 to 15 close contacts in one year.

The voting process in France has traditionally not been high-tech. Voters would close themselves in a booth to retrieve a pre-printed sheet of paper with the name of the respective candidate and place it in an envelope.
After the voter's identification by officials, the latter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The entire procedure is carried out in strict accordance with the electoral law of France.
Starting from 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent. This was done so that voters and observers can confirm that at the start of voting there were no envelopes in the boxes and that no other envelopes (except those cast into the ballot boxes by duly authorized and counted voters) were placed there.
To verify each part of the process, candidates may send their representatives. In the evening, following specific procedures, volunteers under strict supervision count the votes.

According to some reports, eight people have died. Official reports mention an approximate figure of 30 injured. However, the final numbers are still unknown.
In the urine samples of pets that died after consuming contaminated feed, both cyanuric acid and melamine were found.
Researchers from the university stated that these two compounds react with each other and form crystals that can block kidney function.
When melamine and cyanuric acid were added to cat urine, researchers observed the formation of crystals.
According to the results of the infrared spectral analysis, the structure and composition of these crystals are similar to the structure and composition of those found in the urine of the affected animals.
I don't know if you understand this or not, but most of the goods delivered to this country from Central America are not subject to duties.
At the same time, eighty percent of our goods in Central America were taxed.
It seemed pointless and, of course, unfair to me.
I always tell people — you treat us the same way we treat you.
Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Governor of California, approved a bill that prohibits the sale or rental of video games containing a high level of violence to minors.

Schneider gave testimony from his own country via video link, while he was located at a US Navy base.
Apart from the competitions on Wednesday, Karpeneda also participated in two individual races in the championship.
At first, she participated in the slalom, where she withdrew from the race in the first run. 36 out of 116 competition participants showed the same result.
During the giant slalom event, she finished tenth among women in the sitting position. Her total time was 4:41.30. She was 2:11.60 minutes behind the first place, which was taken by Austrian Claudia Lösch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth place, which was taken by Hungary's Dánja Juhasz.
Four skiers from the group of athletes with disabilities did not reach the finish line, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers failed to qualify for participation in the giant slalom.
The stolen laptop and mobile phone were returned to the owner by the Madhya Pradesh state police.

Despite the fact that there were three people in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
Nevertheless, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
While the emergency services were freeing the driver from the red Audi TT, traffic on the road where the accident occurred was temporarily blocked.
At first, he was placed in the James Paget Hospital, which is located in Great Yarmouth.
Eventually, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekeye has since been located in the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh, as she is accused of murdering her son.
She is awaiting charges and trial while in custody. However, given that her photos have been widely published, any eyewitness testimony may be called into question.
In other regions of the United Kingdom, this is a common practice; however, in Scotland, the justice system operates differently — courts believe that publishing photographs could potentially be harmful.
"It seems that journalists are treading a dangerous path when they publish photos, etc., of suspects," notes Professor Pamela Ferguson.
The Central Office of the High Court, authorized to bring criminal charges, informed journalists that, at least until an indictment is presented, no further comments would be forthcoming.
According to the information received, the document mentions a border dispute that Palestine wants to resolve in such a way as to preserve the borders that existed before the start of the 1967 war in the Middle East.
According to the received information, among other topics covered by the document are the issues of the future status of Jerusalem, sacred to both peoples, as well as the problem of the Jordan River Valley.
Israel demands that after the signing of the agreement, the military presence in the valley be maintained for ten years, while Palestine agrees to only five years.
Hunters participating in the additional wildlife control program had to be under the close supervision of rangers because the program was being monitored and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
The National Parks and Wildlife Service, together with the company "Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia, Inc.", have recruited qualified volunteers to participate in the culling program implemented under the auspices of the Sporting Shooters' Association.
Mick Flynn, who is temporarily acting as the director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service for park protection and heritage, stated that the four marksmen chosen for the first shooting operation were given comprehensive safety instructions and underwent appropriate training.
Yesterday, Marteli inaugurated the new Interim Electoral Council, which consists of nine members.
This is already the fifth Transitional Electoral Council of Marteia in four years.
The Presidential Commission last month recommended the early dissolution of the Interim Election Council as one of many measures to prepare the country for new elections.
In response to the large anti-regime protests that began in October, Marteli set up a commission.
The cause of the protests, which were sometimes violent and fierce, was the lack of elections, some of which have not been held since 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating defective iPods were registered. This led to six fires, and four people suffered minor burns.
According to a statement by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI), information about those 27 accidents that occurred as a result of using the devices was included in it.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan announced that it had received a report from "Apple" about 34 new cases of overheating, which it classified as "not serious".
In response, the ministry called the postponement of the report by the company "Apple" to a later date "worthy of sincere regret."
An earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 Friday GMT).
Representatives of the Emergency Management Office of the Northern Mariana Islands stated that there were no reports of damage or accidents in the country.
Moreover, according to the data from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there were no signs of the phenomenon.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a bus in the capital of the Philippines, Manila, and held tourists from Hong Kong hostage.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire on tourists with his M16.
Several hostages were rescued, and at this time, according to confirmed data, at least six were killed.
Six hostages, including elderly people and children, as well as photographers from the Philippines, were released early.
An elderly lady needed to use the restroom, so the photographers were held hostage instead of her. Mendoza was shot.
Lihins followed his father's example and became a doctor.
He studied to be an obstetrician and in 1959 began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
When Liggins was working in the hospital, he began studying the problem of premature births in his free time.
According to his research, the introduction of the hormone accelerates the maturation of the embryo's lungs.
According to a report by the Xinhua agency, government investigators on Wednesday found two so-called "black boxes" — flight data recorders.
The memory of Luna was also honored by her fellow wrestlers.
"Luna was the first queen of extreme sports. My first manager. She passed away on the night of the two moons. Quite original, just like herself. Luna was a strong woman," said Tony Dreamer.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels remarked: "Luna was quite a character, at least as much as I am... or maybe even more... I love her and I will miss her... I want to believe that she is in a better place now."
The number of people opposing Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008 (according to a survey of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election).
During the federal election campaign of 2010, Julia Gillard, the acting Prime Minister, stated that, in her opinion, Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
This opinion is shared by 34 percent of survey participants. They want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
The most radical views were expressed by 29 percent of respondents who believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and another 31 percent who, on the contrary, hold the opinion that this should never happen.
It was expected that the Olympic gold medalist would swim 100 and 200 meters freestyle and participate in three relays during the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition is in doubt: he has been complaining quite a bit about his health.
He did not have the opportunity to take painkillers because they are prohibited at the Games.
On January 25, mathematician and computer science professor at the Central University of Missouri Curtis Cooper found the largest prime number known to date.
This discovery was confirmed by several people using various hardware and software by the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is believed that comets could have brought to Earth not only organic substances that can form proteins and serve as a source of sustenance but also water.
Taking into account that comets collided with Earth in the distant past, scientists hope to understand the process of planet formation, primarily that of Earth.
Earlier this year, the 53-year-old Cuomo was elected governor. He signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriages last month.
He dismissed these rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
It is expected that he will run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration states that thanks to the NextGen system, planes will be able to fly shorter routes, which will help save millions of liters of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
In it, unlike the old ground-based radars, satellite technology is used, allowing air traffic controllers to determine the location of aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more accurate information.
The number of transport services is not increasing, and overground trains will not stop at "Wembley"; moreover, there is no ground-level parking for cars, nor is there a park-and-ride facility.
The likelihood of having to hold the game behind closed doors without the team's fans was increasing, as it is quite possible that there would not be enough transport vehicles.
The formation of a new species of birds in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands is described in a study that was published in the journal "Science" on Thursday.
According to a report by researchers from Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden), the evolution of a new species occurred in just two generations, although it was previously assumed that this process required much more time. The emergence of the new species became possible due to the crossbreeding of the endemic ground finch (Geospiza fortis) with the non-native cactus ground finch (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be cast into various shapes. It can be rolled out into thin sheets.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can then be easily twisted and braided. In addition, it can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It could be so thin that from time to time it was used to decorate illustrations drawn in books — the so-called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH level of a certain chemical substance. You can make such an acid-base indicator yourself from red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on the acidity or alkalinity level of a particular substance.
The pH level in the test chemical is determined based on the amount of hydrogen ions (the letter "H" in pH).
The hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost its electron (as is known, a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Stir these two dry powders in a circle until they combine into a single whole, then use wet hands to form a ball from them.
Moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, creating a strange sensation. At the same time, a kind of shell is formed.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet connected to a complex sewage system.
In the houses of Greek cities in Crete and Santorini, which belong to the Minoan period, remnants of sewer systems were found.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman Empire, toilets were sometimes installed in public baths where women and men stayed together.
You use a satellite when calling someone who is thousands of kilometers away from you.
In space, a satellite receives a call and then almost instantly reflects it back.
A rocket was used to send a satellite into space. Scientists have to use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere refracts light, distorting the image.
For a telescope or satellite to be able to reach space, an enormous rocket over 100 feet tall is necessary.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. Easier and faster movement is the greatest thing that the wheel has done for us.
Thanks to him, we got trains, automobiles, and many other means of transport.
Below are medium-sized cats. Their prey is also medium-sized — they hunt both rabbits and antelopes with deer.
In addition to everything, many small cats (including free-roaming pets) catch and eat more numerous small prey — insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the fact that each occupies its own niche, i.e., has a function unique only to it, and therefore does not need to compete with other cats.
Lions are some of the most social cats: they live in large groups known as prides.
A pride may include up to three adult males who are relatives, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
In most cases, females are close relatives, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
The behavior of lion prides and packs of wolves or dogs is similar in many ways. The latter can strongly resemble lions in behavior (but not other big cats) in that they pose a mortal danger to their prey.
A tiger is capable of climbing (but not very well), leaping over great distances, swimming, and pulling with five times the strength of a strong person, like a well-trained athlete.
A tiger belongs to the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars (genus Panthera). No other cats besides these four can roar.
The roar of a tiger resembles more a phrase made up of sharp and loud words than the full-throated roar of a lion.
Ocelots eat small animals. When the opportunity arises, they catch monkeys, rodents, snakes, and birds. Almost all the animals they hunt are much smaller than the ocelot.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find their prey by smell, sniffing the trails on the ground.
Thanks to their night vision, they see well in the dark and move with great confidence. Ocelots hunt by blending into their surroundings and attacking their prey from hiding.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) breaks away from the main population from which they originate (for example, by moving across a river or mountain range or when such living creatures migrate to a new island, making it quite difficult for them to return), they often find themselves in an environment that is significantly different from the place they came from.
In this new environment, there are different resources and competitors, so in order to become a strong competitor itself, the new population will need different traits or adaptations compared to those it had before.
The original population has not changed at all: as before, it still needs to adapt.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, the animals increasingly resemble less the main population from which they separated.
Thousands or even millions of years will pass, and sooner or later the two mentioned populations will look so different that no one would think to classify them as the same species.
We call this process speciation, which actually means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable result and a very important stage of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe. In addition to this, they absorb the carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Plants "prepare" their food from sunlight through photosynthesis. Additionally, they provide shade.
We build houses from plants and make clothes from them. We primarily eat plants. And animals also would not survive without plants.
For their time, mosasaurs were superpredators, so they feared nothing and no one except other mosasaurs.
On its long jaws, there were over 70 razor-sharp teeth, and in the upper part of the mouth, there was an additional row. This meant that its prey would have no chance of escape.
It is not exactly known, but it is possible that it had a forked tongue. The diet of mosasaurs consisted of large fish, turtles, and other mosasaurs. It is likely that they could also consume members of their own species.
Moreover, he would pounce on anything that fell into the water; even a giant like the Tyrannosaurus rex was not worthy of his attention.
Despite the fact that their food would mostly not surprise us, some dishes were, to put it mildly, unusual. Among them were wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a rodent known as the hazel dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, the wealthy held banquets where they ate and reclined at the same time.
The dishes prepared in Ancient Rome could not have included products that came to Europe from America or Asia later.
They did not have, in particular, potatoes, tomatoes, corn, or cocoa. It should also be added that no ancient Roman ever had the opportunity to taste turkey.
The residents of Babylon built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered his home.
Believers brought sacrifices to their deities, and priests tried to meet their needs by conducting various festivals and ceremonies in their honor.
In each temple, there was its own open inner courtyard and sanctuary, which could only be visited by priests.
In some cases, during the construction of temples, special towers resembling pyramids were erected. They were known as ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special shrine dedicated to a god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house did not have much significance.
For the most part, the life of a Jewish family took place outdoors.
Women cooked outdoors; the shops were simply open stalls facing the street. Houses were built of stone.
In Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was of great value.
The territory of Greenland was not densely populated. According to Scandinavian sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while sailing west, he came upon Greenland, which he named "The Green Land."
But regardless of his discovery, the tribes of Eskimos already lived there at that time.
Despite the fact that each of these countries was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you watched the movie "National Treasure," you might think that there was a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this does not correspond to reality. Despite the fact that something is indeed written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, it was written: "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th of July 1776." The writing appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Who wrote it, no one knows for sure, but it is known that the large parchment document (29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) was rolled up for preservation at the beginning of its existence.
Therefore, it is quite possible that this entry was added there simply as a note.
Thanks to the Normandy landings and subsequent battles, the north of France was liberated, but the southern part of the country was still under occupation.
He was under the rule of the "Vichyists". These were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Operation Dragoon began — the Allies landed in southern France.
American and Free French forces liberated the southern territories of France in just two weeks, after which they headed towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture of a fairly large group of people who work and live together in society.
The aforementioned term "civilization" comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning "civil." The latter is similar in meaning to the Latin noun civis, that is, "citizen," as well as the noun civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state." All of this, in turn, somehow suggests something about the size of a society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, even distribution, and a sustainable cultural imprint.
Smaller cultures are often not considered civilizations in the full sense of the word because they disappear without leaving significant historical evidence behind.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states initially established a weak central government in accordance with the Articles of Confederation of the thirteen states. This government consisted only of Congress.
The Congress had no authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities to enforce all laws, which were often not inclined to cooperate.
Moreover, he lacked the authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs imposed by the states.
According to the Articles of Confederation, any amendments required the unanimous consent of all the states, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives often failed to attend.
The Italian national football team, like the German national team, ranks second among the strongest national teams in the world. In 2006, it won the FIFA World Cup.
Football, basketball, volleyball, fencing, rugby, water polo, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing are among the popular sports here.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, while Italians also participate in international games and Olympic competitions.
Japan is located on almost 7,000 islands, the largest of which is Honshu Island. Thanks to this, Japan ranks 7th in the world among the largest islands.
Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical standpoint because it consists of a cluster or group of islands.
The history of Taiwan began in the 15th century, when its name was recorded by passing European sailors as "Formosa," meaning "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern territory of Taiwan and initiated a reform of primitive agricultural practices. For cultivating rice and sugar plantations, the company hired Chinese workers.
The Qing dynasty (1644-1912) captured the western and northern Taiwanese territories in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government in 1895 concluded the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which Japan was granted sovereignty over the island, and the latter ruled Taiwan until 1945.
The Machu Picchu complex consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
To allow tourists to get a better idea of how most of the buildings originally looked on the edges of the complex, the latter have been rebuilt.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored. Restoration work continues to this day.
Yes, the most popular photo format in the world for still images is the 35mm format. At the end of the analog photography era, this film format prevailed.
Films like this are still produced today, but more importantly, the aspect ratio of its width and height is now used in digital camera sensor formats.
This may be a bit confusing, but in fact, the 35 mm format is 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
Accordingly, it is considered that the aspect ratio for this format (after dividing by twelve to obtain a simpler proportion of whole numbers) is 3:2.
Similar or analogous aspect ratios are found in many common formats (for example, the APS format family).
The rule of thirds, often criticized and mocked, offers simple advice that provides dynamism while maintaining a certain degree of order in an image.
If you believe him, the best place to position the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the photograph into thirds in the vertical and horizontal planes (see example).
During this period of European history, the activities of the Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, came under close scrutiny.
Despite all the linguistic and cultural differences that existed, the Christian religion united European countries for more than a thousand years.
Everyone – from the king to the commoner – was under her all-encompassing power.
The essence of one of the main dogmas of Christianity is that wealth should be used to reduce poverty and alleviate suffering, and that this is the very purpose of the church's funds.
For over a thousand years, the central church authorities were located in Rome. Due to such a concentration of power and money, many people question whether this dogma is being observed.
The United Kingdom initiated a naval blockade of Germany shortly after the start of hostilities.
The embargo on the supply of vital goods for military and civilian purposes, although it violated generally recognized international law, which over the last two centuries has been enshrined at the legislative level by several international agreements, turned out to be an effective strategy.
The United Kingdom mined international waters to prevent ships from entering certain areas of the ocean, thereby endangering even neutral vessels.
Due to the fact that there was no significant reaction to this tactic, Germany believed that there would also be none to unrestricted submarine warfare.
Among the majority of citizens and countries throughout the 1920s, the sentiments of pacifism and isolationism prevailed.
The states and nations intended to avoid such a situation in the future, as they had already witnessed the horrors and atrocities during the First World War.
In 1884, Tesla moved to live in the United States of America because he got a job at the Edison company located in New York.
Only 4 cents, a collection of poems, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison, written by Charles Batchelor (his manager from his previous place of work), were in his pocket when he arrived in the USA.
In ancient China, there were unique methods for designating different eras. At each stage of China's history or in each ruling family, there were distinctive dynasties.
Moreover, the reign periods of the dynasties were interspersed with periods of disunited provinces when instability prevailed. The most famous of these was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During the mentioned periods, many nobles who fought for the throne engaged in ruthless battles with each other.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China was the Three Kingdoms era: thousands of people died in the struggle for the opportunity to take the highest place in the great palace in Xian.
The French Revolution had many social and political consequences. Among them were the transition from absolutism to a republican system of governance, the introduction of the metric system, the emergence of nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs not to a sole ruler, but to the entire people.
Moreover, various positions after the Revolution became accessible to all male candidates, resulting in the most successful and ambitious rising to the top.
In the army, the same thing happened because whereas previously military ranks were assigned based on class, now they are given based on skills and abilities.
Moreover, the French Revolution inspired many other oppressed workers from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond the boundaries of worldly life. To engage in meditation and reflection, he often visited a cave on Mount Nur (which translates as "light"), known as "Hira."
The cave itself, which has withstood the test of time, gives a very vivid impression of the spiritual foundations of Muhammad.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world — it is located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In fact, it is very difficult to find, even if someone knows about its existence. Inside the cave, you are in complete isolation.
Apart from the clear beautiful skies above and the many surrounding mountains, you won't see anything. From the cave, very little of this world can be seen and heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that has survived to this day.
The Great Pyramid is one of the many pyramids that were erected to honor the memory of the deceased pharaoh. It was built in the third century BC.
On the Giza Plateau, also known as the "Necropolis of Giza," in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, there are several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), a number of smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The construction of the Great Pyramid was dedicated to the memory of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, temples, and tombs — to the wives and family members of the pharaoh.
A sign indicating an upward bow movement looks like a "V", and downward like a bracket or a square without the bottom side.
The phrase "up-bow" means that you need to start the movement from the tip of the bow and move upwards, while "down-bow" means you need to start from the frog (the part where your hand holds the bow) and move the bow downwards.
The upward movement of the bow usually produces a softer sound, while the downward movement produces a stronger and more confident one.
You can mark your notes with a pencil, but do not forget that the printed symbols of the bow are there for a reason, with a specific musical purpose, so usually, they need to be preserved.
On October 6, 1789, due to a crowd of women from the market, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (four-year-old Louis-Charles and eleven-year-old Marie Thérèse), as well as Madame Élisabeth, the king's sister, had to return from Versailles to Paris.
The royal family was taken to Paris in a carriage. On the way, they were surrounded by a crowd—people in it were whistling, shouting, and yelling threats at the king and queen.
The king and queen had to open the carriage windows under the pressure of the crowd.
At a certain moment, a person from the crowd waved the head of a guard killed at Versailles in front of the queen, who was already terrified to death.
The military expenses of the US imperialists incurred in connection with the conquest of the Philippines had to be paid by the Filipinos themselves.
To pay a significant portion of the costs and interest on the bonds that were placed through Wall Street banking houses on behalf of the Philippine government, they had to pay taxes to the US colonial regime.
Undoubtedly, the main achievement of the U.S. imperialists would be the superprofits gained from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people.
To imagine who the Templars were, one must understand well what became the prerequisites for the creation of the order.
Traditionally, the era during which these events took place is called the Classical Middle Ages — this is the period of European history that encompasses the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
Initially, there was the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Classical Middle Ages, and after it — the Late Middle Ages. The latter, as is commonly believed, ended around 1500 AD.
Under the term "technological determinism," a whole range of practical ideas is understood, from pressure with the aim of promoting certain technologies or technical necessity to a clear understanding that human destiny is determined by the logic on which scientific laws are based, and their embodiment in the field of technology.
Two general ideas are characteristic of most explanations of technological determinism: the development of technology largely occurs beyond cultural or political influence, and technology, in turn, exerts an influence on society that is inherent to it (and not socially conditioned).
In particular, there is a belief that the use of cars stimulates the development of roads.
Nevertheless, if the number of cars is small, a nationwide network of highways makes no economic sense. For this reason, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Due to the large number of car owners, the number of road accidents is increasing. This, in turn, leads to the development of new methods in the field of healthcare that allow for the treatment of various injuries.
A huge element of cultural determinism, influenced by the works of writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel, was characteristic of Romanticism.
When it comes to the Romantic era, people's lives were greatly influenced by the geography of their surroundings. Over time, traditions and culture associated with it emerged. They were better than arbitrarily imposed laws because they existed in harmony with the place and circumstances that society occupied.
While Paris is considered the modern fashion capital, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of Europe in feudal times.
Around 400 AD, the city gains fame as a center of luxury and maintains this status almost until 1100 AD.
During the 12th century, its status as a capital of luxury faded. This happened mainly because the crusaders returned with gifts, among which were exotic spices and silk, which were valued much higher than what was offered in the markets of Byzantium.
It was then that Constantinople ceded the title of the fashion capital to Paris.
The flourishing of the Gothic style occurred between the 10th and 11th, as well as the 14th century.
Initially, the strong influence on clothing style was exerted by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, Western styles may be delayed by 25–30 years due to the slowness of communication channels.
Western Europe began to develop its own style towards the end of the Middle Ages. The fact that people, as a result of the Crusades, began to use buttons to fasten clothing is among the greatest events of that time.
In subsistence farming, the amount of food produced is only enough to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Natural farming is a simple and generally organic system. It is based on the use of preserved seeds specific to a particular ecological region in combination with crop rotation or other fairly simple methods. The goal of all this is to achieve maximum yield.
Many farmers have historically practiced organic farming. Now many third world countries still practice it.
Subcultures bring together people with similar views, who from the position of social norms feel neglected, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of representatives can be distinctive features of subcultures.
The definition of a distinct subculture can be based on various factors — linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of them.
Members of the same subculture often define their belonging to it through a distinctive and symbolic style in clothing, behavior, and jargon.
As an illustration of what socialization is and how important it is, the most common example given is that of children who were unfortunate enough to grow up in an atmosphere of contempt, neglect, various hardships, or humiliation and insults, and who were not socialized by adults in childhood.
Such children are called "wild." Some "wild" children have been in captivity for a long time (usually treated this way by their own parents); in some cases, the lack of parental care was the result of the parents' unwillingness to notice serious physical or intellectual disabilities and deficiencies in the child.
Before they were abandoned or ran away, the wild children may have experienced serious abuse or trauma.
Others, it seems, were raised by animals; according to rumors, some lived independently in the wild.
If a child was entirely raised by animals, its behavior in almost every aspect (considering physical limitations) reflects the behavior of the animal guardian: for example, such a child may fear people or be indifferent to them.
While the aim of project-based learning is to make the educational process easier and more interesting, scaffolding in this regard goes even further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather an assistant that helps people gain new experiences in studying. This may mean using new computer programs or starting a new project.
Assistants can be both real and virtual. For example, a teacher and the small paperclip in the Microsoft Office program are both assistants.
The software includes virtual assistants. They are needed to ask questions, provide hints, and explain procedures that a student or listener may find difficult to understand on their own.
There are many reasons why children may end up in foster families. It can be abuse, neglect, or even coercion.
It is unacceptable for children to grow up in an environment where no one cares for them, they are not raised properly, and their education is neglected, yet this still happens.
In our view, the foster care system serves as a safe area for such children.
It is assumed that thanks to our foster care system, the wards will have reliable medical care, safe homes, good and caring guardians, and stable education.
It is believed that a foster family must meet all the needs of a child that were not met in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet is a means not only of mass communication but also of interpersonal communication.
Thanks to the special characteristics of the Internet, there are additional opportunities for its use and for meeting the needs of the audience.
Yes, for example, the idea is expressed that such concepts as "education" and "socialization" are significant motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The concepts of "personal involvement" and "permanent relationships" were also defined by Amy and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when studying audience reactions to internet sites.
Thanks to the video recording, important discoveries were made in explaining microexpressions — meaning the movements of facial muscles that last only a few milliseconds.
It is claimed, among other things, that correct interpretation of microexpressions can help determine whether a person is lying or telling the truth.
In his work "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks noted how people with brain damage, without understanding the speech itself, can nonetheless accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that animals—for example, domestic dogs—may also be capable of correctly interpreting human behavior.
Research findings from the twentieth century indicate that there are two sources of genetic variability, namely, apparent and hidden variations.
Under the influence of mutations, new genetic variations arise, and through selection, they are removed from the identified pool.
With each subsequent generation, segregation and recombination shuffle variations in these two pools.
The plant resources available in the savanna cannot meet the primates' need for amino acids if their digestive system is similar to that of humans.
Moreover, if they fail to do so, the consequences can be serious. These include malnutrition, stunted growth, and inevitable death.
The most accessible plant resources would be proteins that can be found in legumes and leaves. However, if they are not properly prepared, they are difficult for primates like us to digest.
On the contrary, animal-based food (ants, termites, eggs) provides the body with a large amount of proteins rich in all the necessary amino acids and is easily digested at the same time.
Judging by everything, it should not be surprising if it turns out that our ancestors solved their own "protein problem" in almost the same way as chimpanzees in the savannah today.
Sleep interruption refers to the deliberate awakening of a sleeping person during their normal sleep process and falling back asleep again after a short period of time (from 10 to 60 minutes).
You can achieve this with the help of a relatively quiet alarm clock that will wake you, but not fully.
If you find that you are turning off your alarm clock in your sleep, try putting it on the other side of the room. That way, you'll have to get out of bed to turn it off.
According to other options based on biorhythms, it is necessary to consume a lot of fluids (primarily water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before sleep — this forces a person to get up at night to urinate.
The inner peace of a person is inversely proportional to the tension of their body and spirit.
The more positive the vital force is, the lower the tension. Absolute calm and satisfaction are available to everyone.
Enlightenment can be achieved by anyone. The only obstacle on this path is our own negativity and tension.
The foundation of Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, which were supplemented by the path of Mahayana compassion and a series of methods from Indian yoga.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It combines meditation, Kundalini yoga, and love for all of humanity.
Followers of Kundalini yoga claim that to awaken Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment), one must practice certain yoga poses, mantras, and visualizations, as well as perform breathing exercises.
Divine yoga is an essential part of Tibetan meditation practice. Visualizing various deities allows for the cleansing of energy channels, the opening of chakras, and the attainment of enlightened consciousness.
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the end of the war, systemic, industrial, and cultural contradictions led to conflicts between the countries.
Two years after the end of hostilities, the Cold War begins — former allies turn into enemies.
It lasted for the next 40 years and indeed armies of friendly countries fought in it. The battlefields were located in various regions — from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and many other places.
The Polish defense was shattered by September 17, 1939. Retreat and regrouping along Romanian positions remained the only hope.
Nevertheless, in just one night these plans became meaningless, as over 800,000 Red Army soldiers from the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts entered the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Transportation of cargo by ship is clearly the most efficient way to transport a large number of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the task of naval forces has been to ensure that their country is able to transport people and goods, while at the same time preventing the enemy from transporting their people and goods.
The North Atlantic campaign during World War II became one of the most significant examples of this idea. With the aim of helping Great Britain, the Americans endeavored to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop the aforementioned movement, mainly using submarines for this purpose.
Germany could probably have conquered Great Britain in the same way it conquered the rest of Europe if the Allies had failed.
It appears that goats were first domesticated in the Iranian Zagros Mountains about 10,000 years ago.
Representatives of ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them in order to always have milk, wool, meat, and skins at hand.
Domestic goats usually grazed in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures. They were often tended by goat herders — children or teenagers. The latter acted as shepherds. This is how animals are still herded today.
As early as the 16th century, wagon roads were constructed in England.
Although the plank roads consisted of merely parallel wooden boards, they allowed draft horses to move at greater speed and pull heavier loads than on the existing uneven roads.
Sleepers began to be used to hold the rails in place quite early. However, after some time it became clear that moving on the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with a strip of iron.
This practice became widespread, but due to the presence of iron, the wooden wheels of the wagons would wear out faster.
After some time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. The first rails made entirely of metal appeared in 1767.
The first known means of transportation was walking. Two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means "upright man"), people began to walk upright.
Australopithecines, their predecessors, usually did not walk upright.
Bipedal australopithecine individuals have been found in fossils that are 4.2 to 3.9 million years old, but it is quite possible that seven million years ago Sahelanthropus was already walking on two legs.
It is possible to have a more conscious attitude towards the environment, to become a participant in the ecological movement, or even to become an activist so that in the future these mentioned sufferings do not become very severe.
Often it looks more like symptomatic treatment. However, if we need more than just a temporary solution, we must find and eliminate the root of the problem.
It is quite obvious that due to technical and scientific achievements of humanity, the world has changed significantly. As a result of overpopulation and the wasteful lifestyle of people, the number of problems has increased.
After the declaration was adopted by the Congress on July 4, its handwritten copy, signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was delivered to the printing office of John Dunlap, which was located a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides."
On July 8, John Nixon publicly read this document for the first time in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
On July 6, George Washington received one of the copies, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. On August 10, another copy reached London.
25 original printed copies of the Declaration of Independence (known as Dunlap broadsides) have survived to our time. The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs managed to survive and that it still exists today, but we call them birds.
Because of their feathers and ability to fly, many people do not consider them to be dinosaurs.
But birds still have many traits in common with dinosaurs.
They have claws and scales on their legs, lay eggs, and, like the Tyrannosaurus rex, walk on two hind legs.
Virtually all modern computers perform operations with information encoded as binary numbers.
In the structure of binary numbers, only one of two values can be included—0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or (in computer jargon) bits.
Internal poisoning may not have obvious signs. For example, vomiting is quite a common symptom, making it impossible to make an immediate diagnosis.
An open container with tablets or toxic household chemicals may primarily indicate internal poisoning.
Instructions for emergency medical assistance for this specific poison must be checked on the label.
To designate this group of insects, entomologists use the term "bug" in the formal sense.
This term emerged because people have long known what bed bugs are like—these insects are highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both kissing bugs and bedbugs are nest parasites; they have adapted to life in the nests or homes of their hosts.
About 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) have been registered in the United States of America. Accordingly, this neurological disease is prevalent among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system. The latter includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The study found that women are twice as likely as men to suffer from MS.
A couple may come to the conclusion that raising an infant does not align with their interests or the interests of the child they already have.
Such couples can give their child up for adoption.
In adoption, the biological parents of the child relinquish their parental rights so that other spouses can raise and nurture the child.
The primary goal of science is to determine through the scientific method how the world functions. In fact, most scientific research is conducted using this method.
However, it is not only him that exists. An experiment (this is a test conducted to rule out one or more possible hypotheses through questions and observations) also guides and stimulates scientific research.
Philosophers and naturalists paid most attention to classical texts. First and foremost, this includes, among others, the Latin Bible.
The generally accepted views at that time were considered to be Aristotle's opinions on all scientific matters, including in the field of psychology.
When the number of people who knew the Greek language decreased, the West found itself severed from its scientific and philosophical roots.
Many biorhythms observed in animal behavior and physiology are largely dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles. These arise as a result of the functioning of the biological clock.
In most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, periodic rhythms have been recorded that are not a direct response to external periodic signals.
The biological clock is an autonomous process. Even when external signals do not arrive, this process continues in the form of independent free-running cycles.
One of the main hypotheses, which claimed that DNA is the genetic material, was tested during the Hershey and Chase experiment.
For the implantation of their own DNA into bacteria, Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses.
They conducted two experiments, during which the DNA of the bacteriophage was labeled with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material fragment in which the mutation occurred, and whether the cells affected by it are germline cells, the mutations can have a wide range of consequences.
Only mutations in germ cells can be hereditary. Other mutations can result in cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts those people who are interested in visiting various natural areas and territories because they want to enjoy the overall view and landscape, including delighting in observing the flora and fauna.
As an example of activities that can be done in nature, one can mention fishing, hunting, bird-watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystems.
As an example, visiting, studying, and photographing orangutans on the island of Borneo can be mentioned.
Every morning, people drive their cars from small provincial towns to go to work. On the way, other people pass by them, who work in the places they have just left.
In this dynamic transportation cycle, everyone is somehow connected to the car-based transport system and supports it.
Scientific data indicate that the modern high-carbon economy has disrupted the stability of the biosphere, which has significantly contributed to human evolution over the past two million years.
Transport systems are used by all people who participate in the life of society. And almost all of them are dissatisfied with these transport systems.
In developed countries, you are unlikely to hear so many complaints about bridge collapses or water quality.
Why are transport systems a constant source of such complaints, why do they regularly stop functioning? Is the reason hidden in insufficiently competent transportation engineers? Or is something more significant happening?
The concept of "traffic" implies the analysis of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as the study of how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows represents a complex problem because it is impossible to predict drivers' behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave quite consistently; therefore, as a rule, traffic flows are characterized by a certain rationally conditioned order and can be approximately described using mathematical models.
To more fully and accurately demonstrate what the movement of vehicles represents, it has been established how its three main parameters are interconnected: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
The presence of these connections helps to plan and design road facilities, as well as to manage their operation.
The first animals to take to the skies were insects. The ability to fly helped them more effectively avoid predators, as well as find mates and food.
In most cases, the wings of insects fold along the body.
Thanks to this, they can squeeze into various very small spaces to hide from predators.
Dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects in our time that cannot fold their wings.
One man named Aristarchus claimed several thousand years ago that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some believed that he was right, but many held a different opinion—that the Solar System (including the Sun and other stars) revolves around the Earth.
Sounds reasonable, for, being on Earth, it's hard to assert that it is moving, isn't it?
The Amazon River ranks second on Earth in length among all other rivers and is the largest of them. Its water volume is 8 times greater than that of the river that ranks second.
The widest river on Earth is the Amazon, sometimes its width reaches six miles.
The Amazon River is the source of no less than 20 percent of all the water that flows into the oceans from the planet's rivers.
The Amazon River, into which waters from thousands of smaller rivers flow, has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles).
Although the construction of pyramids using stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom era, in size and technical perfection, no one ever managed to surpass the pyramids of Giza.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period were fascinated by the monuments erected by their ancestors, which at that time were over a thousand years old.
In the Vatican, there are only about 800 residents. It is the smallest independent country in the world with the smallest population.
In Vatican legislation and official communications, the Italian language is used.
The majority of those working in the public sector use Italian as their daily language, while Latin is often used in religious rituals.
All residents of Vatican City belong to the Roman Catholic Church.
Thanks to the fact that the main chemical elements (for example, gold, silver, and copper) are found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools, people knew about them even in ancient times.
Philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that claimed any objects consist of one element or a mixture of several of four elements (earth, water, fire, and air).
More likely it looked like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although, according to his theory, they can transform into other substances to eventually become what we observe.
In most cases, alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains a large number of elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
In addition, there are alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic components. Such a non-metallic component can be, for example, carbon.
All matter in the Universe is made of material. All matter is composed of tiny particles — atoms.
The size of atoms is so small that trillions of them can fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
As a result, when the pencil appeared, it became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the importance of pencils and their frequency of use declined as new writing methods emerged.
People nowadays write messages on computer screens, and nobody needs a sharpener.
We can only guess what fate awaits the keyboard when something fundamentally new replaces it.
The principle of operation of a plutonium bomb is based on using nuclear fusion energy when a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons is formed.
It's like pushing a very heavy carriage up a hill. Repeated nuclear fission will release some of this energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable. This means that they tend to decay under slight external influence or even without it.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust on the near side is about 70 km, and on the far side — about 100 km.
Under the lunar seas, the Moon's crust is thinner, whereas, under the highlands, it is thicker.
There may be more lunar seas on the side of the moon closest to us because the crust is thinner here, and accordingly, it was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Substantive theories focus on what drives people or what attracts them.
The mentioned theories are based on the fact that people have certain needs and (or) desires, which they transform into internal ones and give them a subjective character (in other words, internalize) during maturation.
The mentioned theories describe what exactly makes certain people desire what they engage in, and what factors in their environment can affect whether they will do certain things.
Maslow's "Hierarchy of Needs" theory and Herzberg's "Two-Factor Theory" represent two authoritative content theories.
Essentially, when leaders manage their former colleagues, two types of behavior may arise. At one end of the spectrum will be attempts to remain "one of the guys" (or "one of the girls").
A manager of this type may experience difficulties in assessing performance, making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary measures, distributing responsibility, and holding the guilty accountable.
Another extreme is the situation when a person changes beyond recognition — feels the need to change everything that the team has been doing so far and claims it as their own.
Ultimately, the responsibility for the team's successes and failures lies with the leader.
Such behavior often ends with conflicts between the leaders and the other team members.
Virtual teams must adhere to the standards of excellence set for regular teams, but there are slight differences.
Usually, virtual team members serve as a contact center for the corresponding real group.
Considering that such teams can meet regardless of time zones, they often have more freedom than members of traditional teams, which may not be clear to local management.
Another unique component of a distributed virtual team is the presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109).
The leadership team, to which every member reports, is the so-called "invisible team." It sets standards for each member.
What reason might an organization have to undergo a lengthy process of establishing an educational organization? Innovation is one of the aims of applying organizational learning concepts in practice.
Creativity and ingenuity can emerge when all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organization.
Thus, the process used by an organization whose employees strive together to overcome a certain obstacle can lead to the emergence of a new innovative process that satisfies client needs.
The management of the organization should create a culture characterized by innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning. Only then can the organization be called innovative.
In Angel (2006), the continuous approach represents a method by which organizations can achieve higher efficiency.
The theoretical approach to the study of cognition is supported by physical evidence in the form of neurobiological data. This narrows the field of study and makes it more precise.
The results of the studies obtained by scientists are confirmed by the presence of a close relationship between brain pathologies and human behavior.
It has long been known that various types of cranial-cerebral injuries, focal damage, formations, plaques, pathological changes, and tumors in the brain affect behavior and alter some mental functions.
The development of new technologies makes it possible to explore the structure of the brain and processes within it that were previously unknown to us.
Thanks to this, we receive a huge amount of materials and data for building simulation models, which, in turn, help us understand the processes taking place in our minds.
Although the term "artificial intelligence" usually evokes associations with science fiction, in reality, AI is a very important field of computer science that deals with the study of behavior, learning processes, and the intelligent adaptation of computers.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence includes attempts to make machines automate tasks that require machines to behave intelligently.
As an example, one can mention planning and control, the ability to respond to client requests and technical issues, as well as recognizing faces, voices, and handwriting.
They have emerged as separate disciplines that study real-life problems and propose solutions for them.
In our time, AI is often used in the economy, medicine, technical, and military fields. Additionally, it is a component of software for some computer programs and video games.
Excursions make up a significant part of school education. Often, the teacher takes students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
With the help of modern technologies, virtual tours can be organized. Students can get acquainted with museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire the beauty of artworks. And all of this is done without leaving the classroom.
Participating in virtual excursions together also represents a very good way to reflect on travel and share experiences in future classes.
Students of Bennett School in North Carolina, for example, create a website about their journey to the state capital each year and redesign it every year, but old versions remain online in the form of an album.
Moreover, blogging can improve students' writing skills. Although at the beginning of blogging their grammar and spelling often "limp," this usually changes for the better due to the presence of an audience.
Considering that students are usually the most critical audience, the blog author does everything possible to improve their style to avoid criticism.
In addition, keeping a blog "helps students better understand the world around them." The need to maintain audience interest inspires them and forces them to remain capable and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging encourages collaboration and stimulates students to learn much more than the traditional school approach offers.
If students use blogs properly, they "will be able to develop analytical and critical thinking skills; active engagement with Internet materials will help students define their own position in relation to what has been written by others, as well as express their own views on particular issues" (Oravets, 2002).
Ottawa is an interesting and charming bilingual capital of Canada. Here you can find numerous art galleries and museums that provide an opportunity to get acquainted with the country's past and present.
Niagara Falls lies further south, while to the north is Lake Muskoka, famous for its pristine natural beauty.
That is why, among many other reasons, tourists, visitors, and other outsiders consider Ontario a typical Canadian province.
On significant parts of its territory, which are located further to the north, very few people live, and some areas are almost completely uninhabited deserts.
For comparison, one can cite the following fact that surprises many: the number of African Americans in the USA exceeds the total number of citizens in Canada.
The East African islands are located near the east coast of Africa and belong to the islands of the Indian Ocean.
Undoubtedly, Madagascar is the largest of them. In terms of wildlife, it can be compared to a separate continent.
Almost all smaller islands are either independent countries or belong to France. They are famous for their luxurious beach resorts.
Additionally, the Arabs brought Islam to these lands, and this religion quickly spread to the Comoros Islands and the island of Mayotte.
By the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a sea route to India from Europe around the Cape of Good Hope, the beginning of European influence and colonial policy is dated.
The northern border of this region is the Sahel, and the southern and western border is the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: female tourists are recommended to always say that they are married, even if they are not.
Additionally, it might be useful to wear a ring (one that doesn’t look too expensive).
Women need to understand that, due to cultural differences, they may encounter behaviors that seem like harassment to them. Locals may often bother female tourists, grab their hands, and so on.
Firmly refuse men and boldly stand your ground (despite cultural differences, this is absolutely unacceptable!).
Modern Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen. The Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids used this city as a strategic port, which was called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and then rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca (White House). After the earthquake of 1755, they abandoned this place.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city and named it Dar al-Bayda. The name Casablanca was given to the city by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping.
Next to the Old Town of Medina, you can quickly find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods — leather products, pottery, tagines, hookahs, and various souvenirs, although all of them are intended exclusively for tourists.
Goma is a city in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo near the border with Rwanda, popular with tourists.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano wiped Goma off the face of the earth. It buried most of the city streets, mainly in the city center.
Despite the fact that the city of Goma itself is quite safe, in order to leave its boundaries, it is worth conducting a small investigation to find out if any combat operations are taking place in the North Kivu province at any given time.
In addition, the city serves as a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano. Very cheap services for gorilla tracking enthusiasts are also offered here — it is hard to find more attractive prices in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The standard (local) price for a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
As a result of Timbuktu's relative inaccessibility, its name began to be used as a metaphor to denote distant exotic places.
Despite its reputation as a tourist attraction and having an airport, today Timbuktu is a city plagued by poverty.
In 1990, due to the threat from desert sands, it was included in the list of World Heritage sites in danger.
Henry Louis Gates paid much attention to this city in the PBS channel program "Wonders of the African Continent."
In comparison with other cities in the country, the city stands out even more as it has a more Arabic than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa. It borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border runs along the Crocodile River.
The area of the park is 19,500 km². It has 14 ecozones, each of which is home to different animals and plants.
It is one of the most interesting places in the country and is also considered the most significant of the National Parks of South Africa.
As in all national parks of South Africa, the park charges an entrance fee daily and collects an environmental levy from visitors.
Moreover, it may be advantageous to purchase the so-called Wild Card — a pass that grants access to several parks in South Africa or all national parks in RSA.
The name of the country Hong Kong is borrowed from Hong Kong Island, which is an attraction center for many tourists.
The beautiful buildings of Hong Kong, which form the architectural appearance of the city, are compared to a shimmering column chart, and the waters of Victoria Harbour only emphasize its presence.
The best views of Hong Kong can be enjoyed by leaving the island and heading to the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
A significant portion of Hong Kong's urban development is compactly situated along the northern coastline on reclaimed land.
In the past, this place was captured by colonizers from Great Britain, so if you want to see evidence of the country's colonial past with your own eyes, you should start here.
The Sundarbans Forest is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast into Bangladesh and the interior of India.
UNESCO declared Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The name "Sundarbans National Park" is used for the part of the forest located in India.
Not only mangrove swamps are called forests, but also some of the last untamed jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain and have still survived.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which water bodies or swamps occupy about one-third.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans forest has been a wildlife sanctuary, and currently, it is reported that 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer inhabit this region.
From the inter-district bus station (which is located across the river), buses depart throughout the day. However, in most cases, they leave between 06:30 and 07:30, especially those heading east and to Jakar (which is located in the Bumthang district).
Due to the fact that inter-district buses are often overcrowded, it is recommended to purchase tickets a couple of days before the trip.
Convenient and reliable small Coaster buses manufactured in Japan serve most areas.
A minibus taxi is a comfortable and convenient way to reach nearby places, such as the towns of Punakha (fare — 200 ngultrums) and Paro (fare — 150 ngultrums).
The bridge that spans the Oyapock is a cable-stayed bridge. It connects the banks of the Oyapock River, where two cities are located—Oiapoque (Brazil) and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock (French Guiana).
The height of the two pylons is 83 meters. The length of the bridge is 378 meters. The roadway consists of two lanes, each with a width of 3.50 m.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The bridge was only opened for traffic in March 2017, despite its construction being completed in August 2011.
According to the schedule, the bridge will become fully operational in September 2017, after the completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guaraní, who led a semi-nomadic hunter life and also practiced subsistence farming, were the most significant group of indigenous people inhabiting the territory of what is now Eastern Paraguay.
Other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Payagua and the Guaicurú, lived in the Chaco region. To survive, they engaged in hunting, fishing, and gathering.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," actually emerged in the 16th century when Spanish conquerors encountered the indigenous peoples.
The Spaniards began a three-hundred-year period of colonization.
Paraguay has managed to preserve its uniqueness and identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the largest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields in Las Canitas.
At other times of the year, smaller-scale tournaments and matches can be observed here.
Information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches can be obtained from the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP). It is worth the same as the British pound (GBP).
On the Falkland Islands, currency can only be exchanged at the only bank in the entire country, which is located in Port Stanley opposite the "FIC West" store.

On remote islands, credit cards are likely not accepted. At the same time, they may accept British or American cash; ask the owners in advance about their preferred payment method.
It is virtually impossible to exchange the local currency outside the Falkland Islands, so do it before you leave.
When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer in Montevideo, and vice versa. The reason is that the city is located south of the equator.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics: temperatures above +30°C in the summer months are common.
Winters there can be deceptively cold: the thermometer rarely drops below zero, but due to the wind combined with humidity, the temperature feels lower than it actually is.
The level of precipitation almost does not change throughout the year, so there are no specific rainy or dry seasons here.
Despite the fact that many animals in the park are used to seeing people, you should not feed or disturb them — wild animals remain wild.
The park management advises keeping a distance of at least 100 yards (meters) from bears and wolves, and 25 yards (meters) from other wild animals!
Bison, elk, ungulates, bears, and almost all large animals are capable of going on the attack, no matter how docile they may seem.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year due to the lack of proper distance. Do not approach closely, as these animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous.
Keep in mind that bears and other wild animals are attracted to smells, so do not carry or prepare strongly scented food, and maintain cleanliness in the camp.

The stirrups hang down from both sides of the saddle and serve as supports for the rider's feet.
They provide the rider with greater stability, but there can be safety issues as the rider's legs may get caught.
When a rider falls off a horse, their foot may get caught in the stirrup. In this case, if the horse gets scared and starts to run away, it may drag the rider along. To minimize the risk of this, some safety measures can be taken.
First, special shoes with heels and a soft, fairly narrow sole are worn by most riders.
In addition, for some saddles, especially English ones, safety bars are provided. When a rider is pulled back by the stirrup leather during a fall, the safety bars allow them to fall from the saddle.

A rip current, often observed at a reef or similar location, is the backflow of waves receding from the beach.
The return flow is concentrated in several areas with great depth, which is related to the underwater topology, and there a fast current may form to a great depth.
The cause of most fatalities is exhaustion when people try to swim back to shore against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, it will be quite easy to swim back.

Several countries claim the South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819. The largest number of bases is located here. In 2020, sixteen of them were still in operation.
An archipelago is separated from the Peninsula by a distance of 120 km to the north. The largest island is called King George, and it is home to the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others, one can mention the islands of Livingston and Deception, where a picturesque natural harbor has formed in the crater of an active volcano.
Ellsworth Land, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea, is located south of the peninsula.
In this place, the mountains of the peninsula merge into a plateau. Then they rise again from it, forming the Ellsworth Mountains chain with a length of 360 km. The Minnesota Glacier cuts it in half.

Finland is one of the best places to go rowing or boating. Additionally, in the "Land of a Thousand Lakes," there are thousands of islets located both in the lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
You can do without a yacht on the lakes and archipelagos.
Despite the fact that the largest lakes and coastal archipelagos are actually large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks can provide quite different experiences.
In Finland, boating is a national pastime. According to statistics, there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
A similar situation can be seen in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but nowhere else (for example, in the Netherlands, this figure is at the level of one to forty).

In essence, there is no point in looking for discounts on first or business class tickets for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware of the existence of a certain key group of passengers who are willing to pay the maximum price for the privilege of reaching their destination quickly and comfortably. Therefore, they charge an appropriate fee.
The capital of Moldova is the city of Chisinau. The local population speaks Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a country where several nationalities live and where an ethnic conflict has taken place.

As of today, most modern observatories have become outdated and serve as museums or educational centers.
Usually, such observatories were located in cities or on university grounds, where they were easier to reach than modern observatories. The reason is simple — nowadays, light pollution presents a much greater problem than it used to.
The main part of research telescopes today are grandiose objects of gigantic sizes, which are usually located in peripheral areas with optimal atmospheric conditions.
"Hanami," which means the admiration of cherry blossom, became part of Japanese culture as early as the 8th century.
