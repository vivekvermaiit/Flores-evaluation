This here does not confirm only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, but provides details that fossils alone cannot, such as color and three-dimensional shape.
Scientific studies indicate that the topside of these animals' humps are chestnut brown, while the underside is carrot-colored.
The discovery allows a glimpse into the evolution of pigments in birds.
Previously, the feathers of dinosaurs did not have a well-developed central shaft, called a rachis, but they had other types of feathers – barbs and barbules – researchers deduce that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other types.
The structure of feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for regulating temperature or display. Researchers have proposed that, although it is the tail of a small dinosaur, the example shows feathers of a large one and not the remains of a chick.
The researchers assume that, while this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows signs of a large one and not the scramblings of a chicken.

Eighty percent of our goods were taxed with duties in the countries of Central America. Let's discuss it.
This thing didn't seem to make sense to me; in fact, it wasn't right.
All I tell people is that you should treat us the way we treat you.
The governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger has signed a decree that bans the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
The decree provided that violent video games, sold in the state of California, be labeled with a sticker bearing the inscription "18" and that their sale to a minor be punishable with a fine of $1000 for each violation.
The Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, made a statement this morning announcing the prosecution of both Huhne and Pryce.
Ligurian sentence: O Huhne o s'é dimisso e o saiâ sostituio into governo da-o Ed Davey MP. O Norman Lamb MP o se pensa ch'o piggiâ o ministëio pe-i Daffæ e o Travaggio. O Davey o l' é sensa incarrego. English sentence: Huhne has resigned and will be replaced in the government by Ed Davey MP. Norman Lamb MP is thought to take the Ministry of Energy and Transport. Davey is without portfolio.
Huhne and Pryce are scheduled to appear before Westminster Magistrates Court on the 16th of February.
The deceased are Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21. Cuddeback was the driver.
Edgar Veguilla had injuries to an arm and the jaw, so much so that Kristoffer Schneider requires reconstructive surgery for his face.
The UK's army has failed so much that it was at the head of a fifth man. Schneider has two of them, blind in one eye, a missing section of the skull, and a titanium-reconstructed head.
Schneider testified via videolink from a USAF base in his home country.
In addition to the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo participated in two individual races at the championships.
The first was the slalom, where they got a Did Not Finish in their first run. 36 out of 116 competitors had the same result in that race.
The other athlete, in the giant slalom, finished in tenth place in the women's sitting group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first classified, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth classified, the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four skiers in the women's section group did not manage to finish their races, and 45 out of 117 total skiers in the giant slalom did not manage to classify themselves in the competition.
The police of Madhya Pradesh has recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: “We have arrested five people who assaulted the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and her laptop.”

At the beginning, he/she had been taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later he was relocated to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
A Adekoya is currently in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with the accusation of having killed her son.
He is in custody awaiting indictment and debate, but if it were testimonial evidence, it could be contaminated, after his image is published wherever.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but the justice system functions differently and the courts have considered the publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes that "journalists seem to walk on a dangerous line if they publish photos etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for criminal action, has indicated to the journalists that no other comments will be made at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, referred to the dispute over the borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 war in the Middle East.
Other topics discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a continued military presence in the valley for ten years after signing an agreement, while the PA agrees to allow this presence for only five years.
The operators in the supplementary decontamination test had to be strictly supervised by the rangers, such that the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of a collaboration between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited for the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the director in charge of the Park Conservation and Heritage of the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have received comprehensive safety instruction and training.
Martelly has played a role in a new provisional electoral council (CEP) of nine members.
It is the first CEP of Martelly in four years.
The past month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEO as part of a package of measures to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was the response of Martelly to the widespread anti-regime protests, which began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, have been triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been due since 2011.
There have been 60 reported cases of defective iPods overheating, which have caused a total of six fires and left four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that he was informed of 27 incidents related to the instrument.
Last week, METI announced that Apple reported 34 more heating accidents, which the company called "not serious".
The minister replied by calling the delay of the Apple report "unacceptable."
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).

The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has also stated that there is no risk of tsunami.
A Filipino policeman who is no longer on duty held tourists from Hong Kong hostage after taking control of their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Ronaldo Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been saved and, for now, six are at least considered dead.
Six hostages, including some children and an elderly person, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers took the place of an old woman who had to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot down with firearms.
Liggins was born near his father's footsteps and began his career in medicine.
He studied obstetrics and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study the work of premature births in his free time.

Xinhua reports that government investigators have recovered two flight recorder "black boxes" on Wednesday.
The wrestling partners also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna left on the night of two moons. Beautiful and unique just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels commented that “the Moon was strange like me… maybe never again… love it and lose it… hopefully it is in a better place.”
Among the 1,400 people questioned before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 out of 100 in that survey shared this opinion and wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of those interviewed believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% thought that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic medallist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in the three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to concerns about their form, it was in doubt.
He couldn't take the medicine he needed to overcome his illness after it was banned by the authorities.
Curtis Cooper, mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25.
Several people have verified the discovery by using various hardware and software from the beginning to test it, and it was announced on Tuesday.
And yet there could perhaps have been a source of water. Arrived on earth together with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
The sciences hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth was formed, since comets collided with the ancient Earth.
Governor Cuomo, 53 years old, began his governorship at the beginning of this year and last month he signed a law that legalizes marriage between people of the same sex.
He has defined the voices as “of jesters and of political farces.”
It is speculated that he may run for the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA supports which allows aircraft to fly on shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel every year and reduce carbon emissions.
The new satellite technology in contrast to the old ground-based radar technology allows air traffic controllers to locate airplanes with much more precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No transportation has been put in place and the overground trains do not stop at Wembley, and parking and park-and-ride are not available on site.
The fear of transport disruptions has raised the possibility that the match may have to be played behind closed doors, without the team's supporters.
A study, recently published in the journal Science, reported on the formation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
The researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species has evolved in just two generations, while it was believed that such a process would require much more time, due to reproduction between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Oil can be processed in all kinds of forms. It can be packaged in small containers.
It can be hidden in a suspended thread, which can become tangled and twisted. It can be hammered or enclosed among the leaves.
It can be very well melted and applied onto another metal. It was made more often from that alloy, because sometimes it was used to decorate images painted by hand in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This here is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
The juice of the cabbage changes color depending on whether the chemical substance is acidic or basic (alkaline).
The pH level is indicated by the quantity of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then, with clean and wet hands, shape them into a ball.
The humidity in the walls reacted with the external salts, which felt strange and formed a layer of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had public toilets, including in all the houses, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Sewer systems from ancient Minoan houses have been found in the cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were public baths in ancient Egypt as well, in Persia and in China. In Roman civilization, the toilets were often part of public baths where men and women stayed together in mixed company.
When we call someone who is thousands of miles away, it's like using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call and then reflects it again, instantly.
The satellite was being sent into space by a rocket. The scientists had to place telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts our light and vision.
It takes a tall tower over 100 feet high to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The street has changed the world in an unbelievable way. The most important thing that the street has done for us is that it has given us much easier and faster transportation.
She has brought the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Below him there are medium-sized felines that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
In the end, there are many small felines (including domestic cats) that eat many small prey like insects, rodents, frogs, and birds.
The secret of its success is the niche concept, a special behavior that every feline assumes, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, and they live in large groups, usually called prides.
The herds are made up of one to three large males grouped together, along with thirty females and the young.
Generally, the females are closely related to each other and form a large family of grandchildren and daughters.
The packs of hyenas behave very much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other felines) in behavior, and they kill their prey very effectively too.
As a well-trained athlete, the tiger can jump (but not very well), swim, advance over great distances and hold five times the strength of a human being.
The tiger is part of the big cat group (Genus Panthera) with lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the deep voice roar of the lion, but more like an angry and screeching chicken.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, lizards, rodents, and birds, if they can. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are smaller than them by far.
The scientific evidence suggests that ocelots use their sense of smell to track and find prey animals to eat, by moving around the territory where they were located.
The green-feathered owl sees very well at night and also hides very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by hiding in their environment and then pounce on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they originate (as if they are divided by a mountain range or a river, or if they land on a new island, in such a way that they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population must have different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what was needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, it still needs major initial adjustments.
Over time, gradually, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it starts to resemble the other population more and more.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations would be so different that they could not be called the same species.
Let's examine this process of speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
The plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale through their breath).
The plants make their food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also make shade.
Let's make our homes with plants and let's make our clothes with plants. Much of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time, so it was not afraid of anything, other than other mosasaurs.
Their long jaws were equipped with more than 70 teeth set like razors, with one more placed in the roof of the mouth, indicating that there was no escape for anything that crossed their path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
He swallowed up everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex wouldn't have been able to fight with it.
Many of whose dishes were unknown to their households, the Romans had their share of strange or exotic festive foods, such as boar, peacock, snails, and a type of dormouse called glis.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate their food seated in chairs, the rich had to make do with stools where they squatted on one side as they consumed their meals.
The meals of ancient Romans could not include foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, nor tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted chocolate.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple, which was considered the house of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
All the temples had an outer courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, into which only the priests could enter.
They used to build special towers in the shape of a pyramid, called ziggurats, as part of temples.
The tower's top was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the harsh climate of the Middle East, the house was not very important.
The most important part of the life of a Jewish family was held with the open door.
The women used to eat in the courtyard; the shops had only small open doors facing the street. The stone was used to build the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Norwegian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red had been exiled from Iceland for murder and, when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But, regardless of their discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although all the countries were “Scandinavian”, there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie "National Treasure" you might think that a treasure map has been written on the back of the "Declaration of Independence".
Furthermore, it is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
In the back of the “Declaration of Independence” there were the words “Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776”. The text is seen at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is said that at the beginning of its life the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was folded for preservation.
Therefore, it is likely that the notation has been added only as a label.
The Normandy landings and the battles that followed had liberated the North of France, but the South was not yet free.
He was governed by the "Vichy" French. These were the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and had collaborated with the occupiers, instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragon."
Two weeks later, the Americans and possibly the forces from the Free France had liberated the South of France and were preparing to head towards Germany.
A civilization is a shared culture significant enough to be developed by a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, forming a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis", meaning "civil", which signifies "citizen", and "civitas", meaning "city" or "city-state", and in some way it also defines the dimension of society.
The city-states are the precursors of nations. A culture of a civil type leads to the transmission of knowledge through various generations, a persistent cultural imprint, and an even diffusion.
The smaller cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and are not recognized as true and proper civilizations.
During the revolutionary war, the thirteen states formed for the first time a weak central government – with Congress as the only component – according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, since there was no executive or judiciary, it relied on the central authorities, who often did not cooperate, to enforce all its acts.
He did not even have the authority to annul the tax laws and tariffs between the states.
The Statute required the unanimous consent of all the states before it could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the winner of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, volleyball, swimming, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, and car racing in F1.
Winter sports are the most practiced in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), which makes Japan the seventh largest island country in the world!
Due to the large number of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographic point of view.
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors recorded the name of the island as "Ilha Formosa," or "beautiful island."
From 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the indigenous practices of grain production, and employing Chinese laborers to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
From 1683 and perhaps during the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), they took control of areas of the western and northern coast of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, with which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is developed into three main structures, known as Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most parts of the buildings within the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a clearer idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues even today.
For example, the most common format of still image photography in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It's still mostly produced nowadays, but above all its proportions have been inherited from the shapes of digital camera sensor images.
The 35 mm format is actually a confused figure: 36 mm in width by 24 mm in height.
It is said then that the proportion of this shape (when divided by twelve, to obtain the ratio of whole numbers or the simplest one) is 3:2.
Many common forms (for example the APS family of forms) are paid or closely related to these proportions.
By using and blending often, the rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism, while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
He states that the most effective place for the main subject is the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become both powerful and influential, was put to the test.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has held European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His power enveloped everything, from the king to the ordinary person.
One of the first Christian principles is that money should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are set aside precisely for this reason.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was right.
Just after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proves effective, with cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violates internationally accepted rights, and is codified by various international agreements of the last two centuries.
The United Kingdom has reduced international waters to prevent access to certain ocean areas, also causing hardship for neutral ships.
Since there had been a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the Twenties, the prevailing attitude on the part of most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolation.
After having seen the horrors and atrocities of war in the First World War, nations decided to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla arrived in the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of illustrating separate periods of time; each phase of China or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
Between one dynasty and the other, there was an unstable era of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods is the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
In these periods there have been wars between different nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the ancient history of China, thousands of people died in battles to ascend to the highest throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are indeed many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single sovereign.
Today I approve the Revolutions and occupations in open states to all male candidates, thus allowing the ambitious and successful to move forward.
Maximal speech for the military, because it is necessary to change the ranks of the army based on class, now they were based on importance.
The French Revolution has also inspired many other oppressed people from the working class of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Ligurian sentence: Möma o l’ea profondamente interessou a-e questioin a-o delà de sta vitta mondaña. O frequetava unna gròtta ch’a l’è diventâ famosa co-o nomme de “Hira”, in sciâ montagna de “Noor” (luxe pe-a contemplaçion). English sentence: Mohammad was deeply interested in questions beyond this worldly life. He frequented a cave that became famous with the name of "Hira," on the mountain of "Noor" (a place for contemplation).
The largest cave, surviving through time, displays a very vivid image of the spiritual inclinations of Rome.
Situated on the top of a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy at all to find it even though it is known to exist. Once inside the cave, it is a total isolation.
One can see nothing but the beautiful sky above and the many mountains below. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that is still standing.
Built in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many pyramid structures built to honor a deceased Pharaoh.
The necropolis of Giza, or "Giza Necropolis", in the Valley of the Egyptian Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, as well as many temples and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu and many of the smaller pyramids and temples were constructed to honor the wives and family members of Khufu.
The "upward arrow" sign looks like a "V" and the "downward arrow" sign looks like a staple, or a square without the bottom side.
"Firstly, it means that you should start from the end and clean the bow, and then it means that you should start from the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and draw the bow."
An arch in a higher position usually generates a softer sound, while an arch lower is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to write your signs with the pencil, but remember that the printed music symbols are there for a musical reason, so usually they should be respected.
King Louis XVI, terrified, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Maria Teresa, eleven years old, and Louis-Charles, four years old), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, on October 6, 1789, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.
In a carriage they return to Paris surrounded by a mob of people who shout and hurl threats against the king and the queen.
A mob of people forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows wide open.
At one point one of this mob brandishes the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles, terrifying the queen.
The costs of the war of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the great Filipino people.
I was forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover most of the expenses, and the interests on the bonds were rising in the name of the Philippine Government, through the banking institutions of Wall Street.
Naturally, the great profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the primary gain of Filipino imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages, the era in European history of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
The technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide array of ideas, from the technological push or strict technological imperative, that the destiny of men is guided by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
The most common interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology follows its own course beyond cultural and political influence, and that technology has effects on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the need for cars necessarily leads to the development of roads.
Every morning, a national road network is not economically sustainable only for a few cars, and thus new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The high number of cars leads to a high incidence of accidents on the roads, which causes the advancement in the health sector of new treatment techniques, to enable recovery for damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a significant element of cultural determinism, drawing from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography has shaped individuals, and over time it has intertwined customs and cultures tied to that geography, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
The fame of being a luxury epicenter began around 400 A.D. and lasted until around 1100 A.D.
The slave trade declined mainly in the twelfth century especially due to the fact that the Crusades had brought with them gifts such as silk and spices that were considered more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was in those times that the title of Capital of Fashion passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
At the beginning, the clothes were strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
Moreover, due to slow communication channels, Western styles could lag behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the era, after the Crusades, was that people started using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is farming carried out to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, that cultivates original seeds recovered from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who think to the maximum degree, and who feel neglected by social standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subsidiary crops can be distinctive depending on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, gestures, and language.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take example from the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their developmental phase.
These children are called "feral" or "wild." Some feral children have been isolated by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this abandonment of the child was due to the parents' disgust at a severe intellectual or physical disability of the child.
Wild children can often have experienced serious abuse or childhood traumas before being abandoned or running away.
Of others, it is thought that they were more like beasts; it is said that someone saw him alone in the wilderness.
When raised entirely by animals rather than humans, the wild child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost identical to those of the particular animal with which they have associated, such as their fear or indifference towards humans.
As project-based learning became easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a tool that provides support to people who are about to face a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffold can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but so is the Microsoft Office paperclip guy.
The virtual scaffolds are internalized into software and have the purpose of discussing, suggesting, explaining procedures that might be difficult for the student to manage alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse to extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that isn't stimulating, secure, and educational, but it happens.
We would consider that the foster care system should be an area of support for these children.
Our foster care system had to provide secure housing, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare assistance.
The foster family had to provide everything necessary that was missing in the house from which they had previously been removed.
The Internet combines aspects of mass communication with interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and accessibility to services.
For example, “learning” and “socializing” are proposed as important motivations for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few seconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to detect if a person was about to lie by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article “The President’s Speech”, pointed out that people who cannot understand a speech due to brain damage are still able to assess its sincerity.
He suggests that these abilities in interpreting human behavior can be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two basins of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the base of manifested variation.
Segregation and recombination mix variation forward and backward between the two pools at each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate, with a digestive system like that of a human, to satisfy their need for amino acids from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, the inability to do so has serious consequences: growth problems, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources are the starches and proteins found in the leaves of legumes, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, foods of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) are not easily digested, but they provide high amounts of protein that contain all essential amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" a bit like savannah chimpanzees do nowadays.
The interruption of sleep is the process of when one wakes up on purpose during the normal period of sleep and falls asleep again just after (10-60 minutes).
This can be done slowly using an alarm rather silent to bring you back to consciousness without waking you abruptly.
If you find yourself having to turn off the alarm clock while you sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to silence it.
Other basic options in your lifestyle predict the consumption of plenty of liquids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before sleeping, with constraints like having to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force present is. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this objective is our maximal tension and negativity.
The Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded by the path of Mahayana love and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is quite simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of love that embraces everything.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the divine Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to the collaboration between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, system, process, and cultural clashes led to the division between these countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the old allies had by now become enemies and the Cold War began.
The Cold War lasted for almost 40 years and it was fought indirectly by proxy armies on the battlefields of Africa, Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and in many other places.
Before September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
English sentence: Despite everything, these kingdoms became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army and the Soviet Union entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Transporting goods by ship is the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The sailor's task is traditionally to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and your goods, while interfering as much as possible with your enemy's ability to move their people and their goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples of this was the campaign of the North Atlantic during the Second World War. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to assist Great Britain.
At the maximum time, the German navy, using primarily U-Boats, tried mainly to stop this traffic.
If the wings had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain as it had done with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time about ten thousand years ago in the Zagros mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to maintain them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hide.
The domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often guarded by young boys who were more or less skilled, similar to the shepherds we know. These pastoral methods are still used today.
The wagons were built in England already in the 16th century.
Ligurian sentence: Sciben che e caròsse ean semplicemente constituie da de asse de leno parallele, consentivan a-i cavalli che ê trainavan de razzonze de velocitæ maggioî e de trainâ di carreghi maggioî, rispeto a-e stradde un pittin ciù bricchefòsci de quelli tempi. English sentence: Although the carriages were simply made of parallel wooden axles, they allowed the horses that pulled them to achieve greater speeds and pull heavier loads compared to the slightly rougher roads of those times.
The crossbeams were introduced quite closely to maintain the hillocks in position. In every way, in the morning it was clear that the tracks would have been more efficient if they had had a fulcrum on the upper side.
This is becoming a common practice, but iron used to require more coal for smelting.
In the end, the wooden rails were replaced by iron ones. From 1767, the first entirely iron wheels were introduced.
The first known means of transportation was walking; human beings started walking upright two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, usually did not walk upright.
The specialization of bipedalism is found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as far back as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally respectful way, we can join the environmentalist movement, and we can also be activists to reduce future suffering to a certain extent.
I'm here, many times, it's just like a symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't want only a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is clear that the world has changed significantly thanks to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and that the problems have multiplied due to overpopulation and the reckless lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent a short distance away to the printing office of John Dunlap.
In the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known in print as the “Dunlap broadsides.”
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he had read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 “Dunlap copies” that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The handwritten copy did not survive.
Several paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still living today. They are called birds.
Several people won't know dinosaurs because they go extinct in the future.
But there are several things in birds that seem like dinosaurs.
In the feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs, like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, which means either 0 or 1, and these numbers are indicated as binary digits – or bits, for use in computer science.
The internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are often so general that they make an immediate diagnosis impossible.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of drugs or toxic household products.
Check the instructions on the package insert for specific first aid measures for that particular poison.
The term "scimixa" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of small creatures.
This term comes from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are creatures strongly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both the silk moths and the Codling moths are creatures that make the nest, and that are good at living in the nest or in the house of their host.
In the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
L’SM a l’è unna marottia ch’a corpisce o scistema nerovoso centrale, che o l’è constituio da-o çervello, da-o midollo do fî da scheña e da-o pin de l’euggio. English sentence: MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Research has discovered that women have twice the probability of having MS compared to men.
A couple can decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the interest of their son, to raise a child.
These snakes can form a bond of adoption for their child.
In an adoption, the natural parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can act as parents to the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world functions through the scientific method. This method, in fact, guides most scientific research.
It is not only, however, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations that also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on classical texts and, especially, on the Bible in Latin.
The opinion of Aristotle has been accepted on all scientific matters, including psychology.
With the loss of knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Quite often the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological relays.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been documented in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain a cyclic period even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments by marking the DNA of the phage with a radioactive phosphorus or the phage's protein with a radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material of the affected piece, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be transmitted to offspring, while mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism is based on nature or the attraction of people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including flora and fauna.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography or birdwatching, visiting parks and studying information on the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and knowing orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave in their cars to small towns to get to their workplace, and they are overtaken by others whose work destination is the place that the former have just left.
In this vision of dynamic transport, everyone is somehow connected and supports a transport system based on private vehicles.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that has sustained human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and must use transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, the reason for the differences in water quality or the collapse of bridges is felt.
Why do transportation systems create these problems, why do they fail every day? Are the transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
The Traffic Flow is the study of the movement between two lanes of driving and vehicles, and the interactions they create among each other.
Unfortunately, studying the traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of the driver cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to exhibit behaviors within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, designing, and management of roads.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. Their ability to fly helped them escape predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to hide more easily. This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
This here gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot be received by sound are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarco said that the solar system revolved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This makes sense, because the Earth is not perceived as if it were about to mingle, isn't it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes as wide as six miles.
A good 20 percent of the water poured into the planet's oceans by rivers comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
It is known that the construction of stone pyramids took place before the end of the Old Kingdom, and the pyramids of Giza have never been surpassed in size and technical excellence in their construction.
The ancient inhabitants of the New Kingdom boasted about the monuments of their predecessors, which by then were well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City adopts Italian in its legislation and official communications.
The Italian language is thus used as the everyday language by most of those who work in the State, so much so that Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Catholic.
The people knew the basic chemical elements like gold, silver, or copper, because these could all be found in nature in their original form and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This here was more similar to the four states of matter (in decreasing order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, knowing that it was also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are plenty of elements in your periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Naturally, there are also metals like silver or gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are never so small that billions of them could fit into the period of this sentence.
Therefore, the fox has been a good friend for many people, when it appeared.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lesser status and to more limited uses.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens without ever having to approach a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what the head will become when something new arrives.
The fission bomb functions according to the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
A bit like stopping a heavy cart on a little hill. Dividing the nucleus again, then, releases part of that energy.
Certain atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break apart with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70km thick on the near side and 100km thick on the far side.
It is more subtle under the seas and deeper under the heavens.
The porpoise emerged more often on the side near the shore because the tide was lower. It was easier for it to move to the surface of the water.
The theories of behavior are focused on the search for what makes people behave in a certain way, or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or decisions that have been internalized in ways that affect them into adulthood.
These theories relate to what has been seen with certain people who are influenced to choose the things they do and what things they are made to do or not do in their environment.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors emerge when managers begin to guide their former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum, there is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or of the girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, evaluating performances, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels the need to change everything the team has done and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often translates into fractures between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the highest standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of the virtual team act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
Often they have more autonomy compared to members of the conventional team because their teams can meet based on variable hourly flows that might not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the leadership group to which all the members refer. The invisible team establishes the standards for each member.
Why should an organization wish to face the long process of setting up an organization that learns? An objective for putting the concepts of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
When all the available resources are effectively used in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, it is the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle or to bring in a new innovative process to meet the customer's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum method as a method to develop organizations towards a higher performance level.
Neurobiological data provide evidence for a theoretical method of cognitive investigation. Therefore, they narrow the area of research and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior concerns scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, traumas, injuries or tumors, affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The growth of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never seen before.
This here provides plenty of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes of our mind.
Although AI has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science, which deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves the development of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, which focus on solutions to real-life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is often used in sectors of the economy, medicine, engineering, and the military, because it has been implemented in various software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of some classes. Very often a teacher would like to take their students to places where traveling by bus is not an option.
The technology offers a solution with virtual field trips. Students can examine objects in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful artworks while seated with their class.
Virtually sharing a school trip is also a way to reflect on a journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year the website is updated, but the old versions are kept online as a scrapbook of memories.
The blog can then help to improve the students' writing. Since students often start their experience on the blog with incorrect grammar and spelling, the presence of a public audience changes things.
Since students are often the most public or most critical, the blog writer begins to strive to improve the writing to avoid criticism.
The blog "forces students to become experts on the world around them." The need to feed the public's interest inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages extending learning far beyond traditional classroom hours.
The appropriate use of blogs "can allow students to become more analytical and critical; through an active response to the materials on the internet, students can define and position themselves in the context of writings by others and outline their perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada, and it features a series of art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
Further south, there are the Niagara Falls and to the north lies the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and other places as well.
All these things and others still highlight Ontario as what is typically considered Canadian by outsiders.
The large areas further north are rather sparsely populated and some are wild and almost uninhabited.
For a comparative population that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
The Madagascar is the largest of the two beautiful ones, and a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the minor islands are independent nations, or associated with France and known as luxury seaside locations.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it has had great success in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence and European colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended to all women who travel to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is useful to also wear a ring (just one that is not too expensive).
The women had to realize that cultural differences could turn into something they might consider as harassment, and it's not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by an arm, etc.
Sit still in the argument and don't be afraid to maintain your position (cultural differences or not, it isn't right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port, called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt cities like Dâr-al-Beyda and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Down in the old medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional products like textiles, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of trinkets, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the western part of the country, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the city streets, especially those in the center.
They write that Goma is quite safe, and visits to the front line of Goma can help understand the state of the battle that persists in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, as well as one of the best routes in Africa for gorilla sightings.
To get around in Goma, you can use boda-boda (or arrange to travel by motorcycle). The usual price for a short ride is 500 Congolese francs or a bit more.
In combination with its relative inaccessibility, “Timbuktu” has been used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today Timbuktu is a poor city even though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
From 1990 it has been added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of the desert sands.
It was one of the main stages in the PBS special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is in sharp contrast with the rest of the country because it has a more Arab than African atmosphere.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, with Zimbabwe to the north, such that the southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and it has been considered a jewel of South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance costs to the park.
It may also be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card, which provides entry to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider the main attraction.
The row of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a barcode clearly reflected by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head then towards the Kowloon waterfront.
The vast majority of the urban development of the island of Hong Kong is densely populated on reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers took as their own, and so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans is the largest contiguous area of coastal mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps: they include some of the last surviving remnants of dense jungles that once covered the plains of the Ganges.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which one-third is covered by water or swamp areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that currently there are about 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
The buses leave from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most of them, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
As inter-district buses are often full, it is advised to purchase the ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese-made buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
The shared taxis are a fast and comfortable means for traveling to nearby places, like Paro (Nu150) and Punakha (Nu200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is planned for September 2017, when it is expected that Brazilian customs checks will be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group among those who inhabited what is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who practiced subsistence agriculture.
The region of Chaco was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as Guayacurù and Payaguá, who survived by hunting and fishing.
During the 16th century, Paraguay, then called “the giant province of the Indies,” was born from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the original indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began the period of colonization which lasted about three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and some of the best players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
The minor festivals and parties that can also be seen at other times of the year.
For news about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo games, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the value of which is set equal to that of the British pound.
The money can be exchanged at the only bank located in Stanley, just after the FIC West shop.
British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also frequently accepted.
In those peripheral islands, credit cards might not be accepted, even though British and American currencies could potentially be exchanged; check with the owners in advance to determine what an acceptable method of payment is.
It's almost impossible to change the currency from Falkland to that of the islands, so exchange the money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, summer there occurs when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics, in the summer months temperatures commonly range up to 30 degrees.
The winter can be deceptively cold: the temperatures rarely fall below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no particular "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of water remains more or less the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
It doesn't matter how much they weigh or pay: the bison, the bears, the deer, the bears, and almost all the large animals could attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they did not maintain the proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them some space.
Moreover, keep in mind that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or preparing foods that produce smells and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the theater of a notorious naval blockade situation in 1889, when seven ships coming from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships have been sunk, except a British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives have been lost.
In the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of the supreme leader Tupua Tamanese Lealofi III.
There are many ways, due to the fact that Auckland is split between two harbors. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and run from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
I am covered all over with snow followed by a cloud, and sometimes there's shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on Waitemata Harbour, in the inner surroundings of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are the customs of families of many people with a beautiful row of well-aligned shops in the square. Christmas is approaching.
The main local beer is "Number One", it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There is a lot of French wine to have, but the New Zealand and Australian wines might travel better.
The water from the local tap is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you prefer.
For Australians, the idea of a “flat white” coffee was foreign. A short black is an "espresso", a cappuccino is filled with cream (not froth) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are a bit expensive but really good.
Many trips to the coral reef are made all year round, and the injuries due to one of these causes at the coral reef are rare.
Ligurian sentence: Con tutto, danni a mente a-i conseggi de autoritæ, obbedisci à tutti i segnali e danni a mente con molta attençion a-e avvertense de seguessa. English sentence: However, keep in mind the advice of the authorities, obey all signals, and pay close attention to the following warnings.
The jellyfish are found near the beaches and near the river mouths from October to about the north of 1770. Sometimes they can be found outside of these periods.
Sharks exist, but it is unlikely that they attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and they swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean; their main habitat is in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking a trip in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind of having a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.

During snowstorms, even a brief period of snowfall is enough to block you.
Visibility can also be limited by rain or fog or by condensation, or by ice on the car windows.
Besides, the conditions of ice and snow are normal in many countries, and the traffic continues as usual without interruptions all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.

Duty free shopping is an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and duties in certain locations.
Direct travelers to countries with a heavy taxation burden on goods can save a nice amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Mario and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburg highway, running continuously through isolated terrain in the woods.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your concentration high: there are steep slopes, narrow paths, and curves at every turn.
The speed limits on public roads are much lower than the preceding and subsequent stretches – in the area 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strictly obeying these is even more important than anything else.
Interestingly, however, the mobile phone service is much stronger here than along many other parts of the path, for example, the wild lands of Pennsylvania.
The German desserts with fine taste, in Bavaria, are quite rich and diverse, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.

The stirrups are supports for the feet of the rider that hang on both sides of the saddle.
They could provide greater stability for the horse but can cause following problems due to the possibility that the horse's feet might become trapped inside.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse runs away. To reduce this risk to a minimum, it is possible to adopt a series of safety precautions.
First of all, most of the riders wear riding boots with a smooth, slightly tight sole.
Then, certain saddles, especially English saddles, have loops for saddle straps to be held behind a horse that kicks.

Under good conditions, you can manage to cover slightly longer distances on foot compared to by ski, but only with good snow can you achieve cross-country skiing speed without a heavy load on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to go through multiple visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen Area, for the rest, functions in some way like a single country, in this sense.
As long as you stay in this area, you can cross the borders by plane without going through passport control checkpoints.
In the same way, having a Schengen visa, it is not necessary to apply for visas for each of the Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for what objects are considered antiques. Certain tax agencies define goods that are over 100 years old as antiques.

Transgender people before surgery should not expect to pass through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
The currents of seven are the backflow of the waves that break offshore from the beach, often on a rock or similar.
For reasons of underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in certain deeper sections and there a fast current towards deep waters could form.
The greatest part of disasters occurs due to the effort of swimming against the current, something that could be impossible.

Try to move from somewhere you don't get caught again, depending on your abilities, and if you are noticed, you might have to wait for help.
The return shock arrives before the one linked to the habit (or is not linked to the revelation of the new), lasts longer, and can have stronger effects.

Your local telephone company should be able to provide you with more detailed information about the connection to this service.
An option that is becoming increasingly popular for those who want to take a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
It is more common among those who have quickly finished school, because it allows them to spend a gap year before starting university without compromising their educational path.

Finland is an important destination for boats. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes there is no need for a yacht.
Despite the fact that the coastal archipelagos and the larger lakes are large enough for all yachts, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a unique experience.

The easiest way to travel in first class or business class is to spend a lot of money (or, even better, let the company where you work pay for it).
But comfort does not come cheap: usually the cost of business class is up to four times greater than that of economy class, whereas first class costs eleven times as much!
As a matter of principle, there is no reason to try to bargain for first-class or business class seats for direct flights from A to B.
The airline companies know well that there is a certain amount of travelers who would pay an eye from their head for the privilege of arriving at a certain place quickly and in full comfort, and they set the prices precisely on this basis.
