USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the U.S. Olympic Committee and acknowledges the absolute need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and the sports they practice, may be better served by implementing significant changes in our organization rather than by the withdrawal of certification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can shed light on how abuses of the magnitude so courageously described by those abused by Larry Nassar could go unnoticed for so long, and accepts any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal – to make gymnastics, as well as other sports, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe environment with a positive and permissive atmosphere.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs were covered with feathers, a hypothesis already widely accepted, but it provides details that generally cannot be obtained from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown on the upper parts, with a light or orange color on the lower parts.
The discovery also provides insight into how birds' feathers evolved.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but present other characteristic elements of feathers – barbs and barbules – researchers concluded that the rachis was probably an evolutionary development that appeared after the other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers have suggested that, even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not chick down.
Researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not the down of a hatchling.
A car bomb that exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured over 20 people.

They discovered that the Sun operates under the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system was found to be driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star will be in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work done was largely theoretical, but the program was designed to stimulate the observation of the galaxy in Sagittarius.
The effect the team was looking for would have been caused by the tidal forces produced between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have managed to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter does.
This theory states that the dark matter of a galaxy is located around the galaxy like a kind of aura and is composed of a multitude of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the presence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
"In an interview, he stated that the new variant is 'very disturbing and worrying due to the very high mortality rate.'"
It is possible that some patients contracted the virus in the hospital, claims Dr. Moll, and at least 2 were hospital staff.
Over the course of a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 people with whom they are in close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis still seems to be low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 infected individuals at any given time in South Africa.

Infrared images show that temperature differences between night and day indicate the likelihood that these are caves.
"They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night."
Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of some large caves on Earth, which generally maintain a constant temperature, but it is consistent with the hypothesis that these might represent deep holes in the ground,” said Glen Cushing from the Astrogeology Team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters seclude themselves in a booth and place in an envelope a pre-printed piece of paper on which they indicate the candidate they have chosen.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The French electoral law rather strictly codifies the procedures to be followed.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can confirm that there are no envelopes at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added, except for those of voters who are duly counted and authorized.
Candidates can send representatives to witness all stages of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following clear procedures.

Edgar Veguilla was injured in the arm and jaw, and Kristoffer Schneider will need reconstructive facial surgery.
Uka's weapon malfunctioned while it was pointed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider experiences ongoing pain, cannot see out of one eye, is missing a section of his skull, and has his face reconstructed from titanium.
Schneider's testimony was taken via a video link from a USAF base located in his home country.
After Wednesday's event, Carpanedo competed in two individual races at the Championships.
The first event she participated in was the slalom, where she did not finish on her first attempt. 36 out of the 116 competitors achieved the same result in that race.
In the other race she participated in, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's sitting group, with a total time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first-place finisher, Australia's Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth-place competitor, Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four female skiers from the seated position event did not finish their round, and 45 out of the total 117 skiers in the giant slalom did not secure a place in the competition.
The police in Madhya Pradesh have recovered the laptop and mobile phone that had been stolen.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya stated: "We have arrested five people who assaulted the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed until the emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She was detained pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be tainted because her image was widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system operates differently, and the courts have ruled that publishing the photographs can be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee observes that "journalists seem to be playing with fire by publishing photographs and other information about suspects."
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is in charge of the prosecution, informed journalists that it will not make any further comments at least until the indictment.
According to the information leak, the document will address the dispute regarding the borders, which Palestine wants to be drawn based on the pre-1967 Middle East war boundaries.
Other topics addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is a sacred place for both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel claims that, after the signing of the agreement, it should have a continuous military presence in the valley for a period of ten years, while the PA agrees to accept this presence only for a period of five years.
The hunters who participated in the additional pest control test were to be closely supervised by the foresters, with the test being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited under the Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Executive Director for Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety instruction and training.
Martelly took the oath yesterday in front of a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), composed of nine members.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEO as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests, which began in October, was the Commission.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which should have taken place as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating iPods that malfunctioned have been reported, causing a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
"Last week, METI announced that Apple reported another 34 overheating incidents, which the company said were 'not serious.'"
"The ministry responded, saying that the delay on Apple's part is 'truly regrettable.'"
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at local time 07:19 (Friday at 21:19 GMT).
The Office of Emergency Management of the Northern Mariana Islands stated that no damages have been reported in the country.
Furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there are no indications for a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and so far, the death of at least six has been confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, along with Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers took the place of an elderly woman who needed the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She studied obstetrics and in 1959 began working for the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm labor in his free time.
His research demonstrated that if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate the fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
The fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. A unique moment, as she was. A strong woman."
"Dustin Runnels, nicknamed 'Gold Dust', commented that 'Luna was as eccentric as I am... maybe even more... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she's in a better place.'"
Of the 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that, in her opinion, Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II comes to an end.
34% of those interviewed agree with this opinion, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the ends of the survey, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim at the Commonwealth Games in the 100m and 200m freestyle events, as well as in three relay events, but his physical condition was questioned due to his complaints.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to control the pain, as they were prohibited during the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
Several people checked the discovery before the beginning of February, using different combinations of hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of Earth's water supply, along with organic matter, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, aged 53, began his governance earlier this year and last month signed a bill that legalizes same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as representing "political chatter and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system about which the FAA claims would allow aircraft to travel shorter distances, thereby saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses technology that relies on the use of satellites, as opposed to older systems based on ground radars, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and transmit more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transport means are available, surface trains do not stop at Wembley, and parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available in the area.
Fears concerning the lack of transportation have raised the possibility of holding the match behind closed doors, without the presence of the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the development of a new species of birds on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer, due to the breeding between the endemic Darwin's finches, Geospiza fortes, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be crafted into a multitude of designs. It can be rolled into tiny objects.
It can be drawn into thin threads that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and stuck over another metal. It can be made so thin that it has sometimes been used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can prepare an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemical substance.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which the electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix together the two powders, and then, with clean and wet hands, form a ball from them.
The humidity present on your hands will react with the outer layers, which may give you a strange sensation and lead to the formation of a sort of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of the sewer systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. Among the Romans, toilets were sometimes found as part of public baths, which men and women used together.
When you call someone thousands of kilometers away, you do it through a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A huge rocket, 100 feet tall, is needed to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel has given us is to provide much simpler and faster transportation.
The train, the car, and many other means of transport brought us.
Beneath them, we have several medium-sized felines, which feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Ultimately, there are many small felines (including free-roaming pet cats) that eat the much more numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the niche concept; each feline has its own role to fulfill, so it is not in competition with others.
Lions are the most social felines, living in large groups called prides.
Families are made up of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and offspring.
Females are usually related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion families behave very similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals with behavior surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large felines), and also very lethal to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, leap long distances, and can pull with a force five times greater than that of a strong man.
Tigers belong to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four big cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger does not resemble the full-voiced roar of a lion, but rather a sentence of sharp, shouted words.
Ocelots like to consume small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, or birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey using their sense of smell, sniffing the ground to locate them.
Thanks to their night vision, they can see very well in the dark and move undetected. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves in their environment, then pouncing on the prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or a river or relocates to a new island, from which it cannot easily return), it will often find itself in a different environment from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than what was needed before.
The initial population has not changed at all; it needs the same adaptations as before.
As time passes, as the new population adapts to the environment, its members begin to look less and less similar to the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that we will no longer be able to say they are the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and represents a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe in, and absorb carbon dioxide, which people exhale (meaning they expel it from their lungs).
Plants produce their food with the help of the sun, through photosynthesis. Additionally, they provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, fearing nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had over 70 blade-sharp teeth, along with an additional set in the palate, meaning that nothing in its path escaped unscathed.
We don't know for sure, but it might have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other species of mosasaurs, and it might even have been a cannibal.
Additionally, it attacks anything that enters the water; not even a huge dinosaur like T-Rex could have faced it.
While much of their cuisine would be familiar to us, the Romans also had strange or unusual festive dishes, which included wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate sitting on chairs, wealthy men liked to hold banquets where they would lie on one side while eating.
The cuisine of ancient Rome could not include foods that arrived in Europe, from America or Asia, in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the house of that god.
The people brought offerings to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary into which only priests could enter.
Sometimes, as part of the temples, pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were also built.
The top of the tower constituted the sanctuary dedicated to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was less important.
Most of the life of a Jewish family took place outdoors.
The women were cooking in the yard; the shops were just counters that opened directly onto the street. Stone was used for building the houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was scarcely colonized. The Scandinavian saga mentions that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling further west, he found a Green Land and named it Greenland.
However, regardless of the discoveries he made, tribes of Eskimos were already living in those places at that time.
Although they were all "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences in terms of population, kings, customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you watched the movie National Treasure, you might believe that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, it is not true. Even though something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words can be read: 'Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776.' The text appears upside down, at the bottom of the document."
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that, in its beginnings, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was kept rolled.
So, the marking was probably done simply for labeling.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
"It was led by the French 'from Vichy'. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked alongside the invaders instead of fighting against them."
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion being called 'Operation Dragoon'."
In just two weeks, the American forces, alongside the Free French forces, had liberated southern France and were heading towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state; it also in a way defines the size of the society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilizing culture involves the transmission of knowledge across multiple generations, a persistent cultural footprint, and a reasonable spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and are not recognized as actual civilizations.
During the Revolution, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government – with Congress being its only component – under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the often uncooperative state authorities to implement its decisions.
Moreover, he did not have the authority to repeal laws and tax tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be amended, and the states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The national football team of Italy, together with the German national football team, is ranked second among the most successful teams in the world and were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Among the popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic events.
In Japan, there are nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
"Owing to the groups of islands Japan has, it is often said that Japan is, geographically speaking, an 'archipelago.'"
The beginning of Taiwan took place a long time ago, in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by the island recorded the name as Ilha Formosa or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the production practices of indigenous grains and employing Chinese workers to work on sugar and rice plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644 - 1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1985, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common static photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its proportions have been adopted by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format, somewhat confusingly, is actually 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore stated to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS format family) are identical to or very close to this ratio.
The rule of thirds, much abused and often ridiculed, is nothing more than a simple suggestion to create dynamism while maintaining some order in an image.
According to this, the best place for positioning the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the frame into thirds vertically and horizontally (see the example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, drew attention to itself.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion connected European states to each other, despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds exist specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether the principle was truly being respected.
Shortly after the hostilities began, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, interrupting the supply of vital military and civilian provisions, although this blockade violated the generally accepted provisions of international law, enshrined in several international agreements signed in the last two centuries.
Great Britain mined the international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
The response to this tactic being reserved, Germany expected a similar reaction in the case of its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the predominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with only 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss from his previous job) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of marking different periods of time; each era of China or each family that held power represented a distinct dynasty.
Also, the periods between consecutive dynasties were marked by divided provinces. The best-known interval of this kind was the Three Kingdoms Period, spanning 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
Fierce wars occurred during these times between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting to seize the throne of the grand palace in Xi'an.
It had many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from an absolutist system to a republican and nationalist one, and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not to a single leader.
After the Revolution, men were also able to access all occupations, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
Similarly, in the case of the military, because instead of the class-based army hierarchy, they now relied on caliber.
The French Revolution, in turn, inspired many other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohamed was deeply interested in things that went beyond the worldly. He used to often go to meditate in a cave that became known as "Hira," located on Mount "Noor" (light).
The cave itself, which has survived through time, allows us to form a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is hard to find even when you know of its existence. Once inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
The only things that can be seen are the clear and beautiful sky above and the mountains all around. Very little of this world can be glimpsed or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that has remained standing to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramid structures constructed in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also called the "Giza Necropolis", in the Valley of the Dead, Egypt, houses several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the tallest), several smaller tombs, a series of temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up stroke" mark looks like a V, and the "down stroke" mark looks like a staple or a square missing the bottom side.
Up means you have to start from the tip and push the bow; down means you have to start from the frog (i.e., the part where you hold the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
An up-bow stroke usually produces a softer sound, while a down-bow stroke is stronger and more decisive.
Do not hesitate to mark your own indications, but remember that the printed indications for bowing features are there for musical reasons and normally should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced by a crowd made up of market women to return from Versailles to Paris.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd shouting and yelling threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to leave the carriage windows wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd raised the head of a member of the royal guard, killed at Versailles in front of the terrified eyes of the queen.
The war expenses of United States imperialism in the conquest of the Philippine state were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and the interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by the banking houses on Wall Street.
Of course, the enormous profits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people have constituted the main gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is usually called the High Middle Ages, representing the era in European history that encompasses the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or the technological imperative, to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an inherent logic, associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path largely outside of cultural and political influence, and that technology, in turn, has 'effects' on society that are inherent rather than socially conditioned."
For example, it could be said that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
A large number of car owners leads to an increased incidence of accidents on public roads, which results in the invention of new medical techniques for healing bodily injuries.
An important component of Romanticism was cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and, over time, customs and cultures related to that geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place occupied by society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is considered the fashion capital in the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital in medieval Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began to spread around 400 A.D. and lasted until around 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because the crusaders returned laden with gifts such as silk and spices more valued than what the markets of Byzantium offered.
This was the moment when the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak during the period between the 10th - 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west can be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important advancements from that period was that, following the Crusades, people started to use buttons for fastening clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often ecological system that uses saved seeds native to the same ecological region, alongside crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still happening in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar thinking, who feel sidelined by societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinct and symbolic use of characteristic style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from a few unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults while they were growing up.
"Such children are called 'untamed' or wild. Some wild children have been sequestered by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the child's abandonment was due to rejection by the parents because of severe intellectual or physical deficiencies."
It is possible that feral children may have experienced abuse or severe trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
Some are believed to have been raised by animals, while others are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
The wild child, when raised entirely by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (within its physical limits) almost entirely like those of the animal that cared for it, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning is supposed to ease and make learning more interesting, scaffolding goes a bit further.
The scaffolding method or site method is not a learning method, but rather an aid that provides support to people going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are included in the software, serving to query, provide hints, and explain procedures that might otherwise be too complicated for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for numerous reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, even extending to extortion.
There shouldn't be children growing up in an environment where they lack food, love, and education, but there are.
We perceive the family care system as a safety zone for these children.
Our family care system must provide safe accommodation, caring caregivers, solid education, and reliable healthcare.
Family care is supposed to meet the needs of the children, which were not being met in the home where they had been previously.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet introduce additional dimensions in terms of addressing types of uses and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting facial microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his work "The President's Speech," demonstrated how individuals who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research from the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the set of expressed variations.
Separation and recombination cause the direction of variation to be dominated by one or the other of the two genetic pools in each generation.
In the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans finds it difficult to meet its amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so brings about serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible vegetable resources were leaf proteins and legumes, but they are hard to digest for primates like us if they are not cooked.
In contrast, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also provides large amounts of proteins containing all essential amino acids.
"Considering all this, it should not surprise us if our ancestors solved the 'protein problem' in a manner similar to the chimpanzees in today's savannas."
Interruption of sleep is the procedure by which you intentionally wake up during the normal sleep period to fall back asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to a conscious state without fully waking you up.
If you happen to reset the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking liquids (especially water or tea, which have diuretic effects) before going to bed, forcing us to get out of bed to urinate.
The inner peace that a person feels is inversely proportional to the tension in one's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force is. Everyone has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is one's own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, to which the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga have been added.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The central aspect of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. By visualizing different deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to a collaboration between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, clashes of system, process, and culture led to the distancing of the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War was beginning.
It was going to last forty years and would be fought seriously, by "proxy" armies, on battlefields spread from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was a withdrawal and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
The plans became, however, almost overnight useless when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army were mobilized, creating the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, as well as other international, both bilateral and multilateral, treaties.
Using ships for the transportation of goods is by far the most efficient way to transport both goods and people from one side of the oceans to the other.
Traditionally, the role of the navy has been to ensure a country's ability to move people and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the more notable recent examples in this regard was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were trying to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using submarines in particular, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in occupying Great Britain, as it did with the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them around the house to have easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, usually under the care of goatherds who were often children or teenagers, similar to the well-known shepherds. These herding methods are still used today.
Wagonway-type roads have been built in England since the 16th century.
Although these wagonways consisted only of wooden planks arranged in parallel, they allowed horses to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than they could on the slightly rougher roads of that time.
The sleepers were introduced quite early to keep the rails in place. However, gradually, it was concluded that the rails would be more efficient if they had a metal strap on top.
This has become a widespread practice, but the iron led to the faster wear of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were produced.
The first known means of transportation was walking; people started walking upright 2 million years ago, with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessor, Australopithecus, usually did not walk in an upright position.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils that are 4.2-3.9 million years old, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus was already walking bipedally seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to somewhat reduce future suffering.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we do not want just a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and should disable them.
It is evident that the world has changed a lot as a result of scientific and technological advances, and the problems are greater now due to overpopulation and mankind's extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap, located a few streets away.
"During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known as 'Dunlap broadsides'."
On July 8, the first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 remaining Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But in birds, many characteristics similar to those of dinosaurs can still be seen.
They have scaly legs and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two back legs like a T-Rex.
Practically, all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can contain only one of the two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning might not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best clue for internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Consult the label for first aid instructions regarding that specific poison.
The term "cockroach" is used by entomologists specifically for this group of insects.
The term originates from the old resemblance to bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both assassin bugs and bedbugs are nidicolous, adapted to life in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may conclude that raising a child is neither in their interest nor in the child's interest.
These couples can choose to formulate an adoption plan for their child.
In the case of an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main purpose of science is to figure out how the world works by using the scientific method. This method is applied in most scientific research.
It is not the only one though; experimentation and an experiment represent a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers primarily used classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's ideas about all aspects related to science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself separated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not mere responses to periodic external stimuli, have been observed in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to function for a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the most important pieces of evidence in favor of the hypothesis that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, a type of virus, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, marking either the bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or its proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a range of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells or not.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in any other part can cause cell death or cancer.
Organized tourism around nature exploration attracts people interested in visiting natural environments to enjoy the landscape, including wildlife and vegetation.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, as well as visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example would be visiting, photographing, and finding out more information about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave by car from small rural settlements to head towards their workplaces, passing by others whose work destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this heavily carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states, which supported human evolution over the last 2 million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, similar levels of dissatisfaction regarding water quality or bridge collapses are rarely encountered.
Why do transportation systems give rise to such dissatisfaction, why do they fail day after day? Could it be because transportation engineers are simply incompetent? Or is something more serious happening?
The flow of traffic studies the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and how they interact with each other.
Studying traffic flow is unfortunately difficult because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with absolute precision.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers tends to remain within reasonably constant limits; as a result, traffic flows tend to be reasonably constant and can be mathematically approximated.
To better represent the flow of traffic, we need to establish relationships between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to begin flying. The ability to fly allowed them to more easily avoid enemies and to find food and mates for breeding much more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some considered that he was right, but many believed the opposite; namely that the Solar System actually revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems reasonable because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the amount of water compared to the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with a width of six miles in some places.
No less than 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It gathers the water of thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical mastery of construction.
The ancient Egyptians who lived during the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments built by their predecessors, which by that time were already over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language used day-to-day by most of those who work in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All Vatican City residents are Roman Catholic.
People have known since ancient times some fundamental chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, because they can be found in nature in their native state and are quite easy to exploit using simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed a theory that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were water, earth, air, and fire.
It was rather reminiscent of the four states of matter, (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also theorized that it transforms into another substance to take the form we see.
Alloys are actually combinations of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You will see that some alloys can also include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything found in the Universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions could fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became the friend of many after it was created.
Unfortunately, as newer writing tools have appeared, the pencil has lost its status and number of uses.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever needing to lay a hand on a sharpener.
You can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer appears.
The fission bomb operates on the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart uphill. Breaking the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no momentum.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km in the nearby part and 100 km in the far part.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker in areas of higher relief.
There might be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to reach the surface.
Content theories focus on identifying elements that attract people's attention or bring them pleasure.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they develop to maturity.
These theories study what motivates some people to want to do what they do and what aspects of their environment can determine whether or not they do certain things.
Two popular theories regarding content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor theory.
In general, two types of behaviors can emerge when managers start leading their former colleagues. One extreme is trying to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulties in making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, people become unrecognizable individuals who believe they must change everything the team has done and proceed in their own style.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the team's success or failure.
Often, this behavior leads to rifts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for the physical group they are part of.
Often they have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) also represents a unique component of a virtual team.
"The invisible team" is the management team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each of the members.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of establishing a learning organization? One goal of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources in the functional departments of an organization are used efficiently, creativity and ingenuity can manifest freely.
As a result, the process through which an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to an innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
Neurobiology data represent physical evidence that underlie a theoretical approach to investigating cognition. As such, it allows for narrowing the research area and defining it with greater precision.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain brain functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material for building simulation models, which help us understand the processes occurring in our minds.
Even though AI has strong science fiction connotations, AI is a very important part of computer science, which deals with the behavior, learning, and adaptation of intelligence in machines.
Research in AI involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnostics and queries, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such actions have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, but it has also been used in some software applications for personal computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of any class. Often, a teacher would enjoy taking their students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Technology offers the solution with virtual tours. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while in the classroom.
A virtual sharing of a field trip is also an excellent way to reflect on the journey and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year the students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, the website is redesigned every year, and previous versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also improve a student's written expression. While students often begin their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, the existence of an audience generally has the power to change the situation.
Given that students often represent the most critical audience, the blog author is starting to make efforts to improve their writing and avoid criticism.
"Additionally, blogging 'forces students to be more aware of the world around them.' The need to respond to their audience's interests inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004)."
Blogging is a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their study far beyond the ordinary school day.
"Proper use of blogs 'can help students think more analytically and critically; by actively responding to materials found on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of what others have written and also outline their own perspectives on certain issues' (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada, offering a range of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, while the north hosts the unspoiled natural beauty of the Muskoka district and much more.
These and many others highlight Ontario as being representative of what foreigners consider quintessentially Canadian.
Large areas further to the north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost unpopulated wilderness.
To make a comparison between populations that has the gift of surprising many: the number of African-Americans living in the USA is greater than the entire population of Canada.
The eastern islands of Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coasts of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a true standalone continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are renowned as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam in those lands, which was very successful in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west, it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman traveling should say she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It is good to wear a wedding ring, but it should not look expensive.
Women need to take into account that cultural differences can lead to what may be considered harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Be decisive when you refuse a man and do not be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it still doesn't mean it's OK!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids, being called Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese, who rebuilt it, naming it Casa Branca, but abandoned it again in 1755, following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given by the Spanish merchants who had established trade bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to go shopping.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather items, hookahs, and all sorts of knick-knacks, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of Mount Nyiragongo, which buried most of the settlement's streets, especially the central area.
While Goma is quite a safe place, gaining information is necessary for trips outside the city to understand the current stage of the ongoing fights in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, additionally offering some of the most affordable trips to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
For getting around Goma, one can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price for a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
"Along with its relative inaccessibility, 'Timbuktu' has come to be used metaphorically to mean exotic, distant places."
Nowadays, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger due to the threat posed by desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast with the rest of the country's cities, as it has a more Arab flair than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordered by the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the emblem of the national parks in this country (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are entrance fees and daily conservation fees for the park.
It might also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry either into a series of parks in South Africa or into all of South Africa's national parks.
The name of the territory of Hong Kong is given by Hong Kong Island and is the place that many tourists regard as the central point.
The exhibition of buildings contributing to Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a shimmering bar chart, highlighted by the presence of Victoria Harbor's waters.
To enjoy the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards Kowloon, on the other side of the water.
The largest area of the developed urban part of Hong Kong Island is crowded on reclaimed land along the northern coasts.
This is the space that the British colonizers appropriated, and therefore, for anyone searching for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast inland into Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just swamps with mangroves - they also include some of the last strongholds of the vast jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one-third is covered by water/swamp.
Starting in 1966, Sundarbans became a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because the buses that connect the districts are often full, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby destinations, such as Paro (150 Nu) or Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
With the two pillars rising to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes each 3.50 meters wide.
The clearance height under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní represented the most important indigenous population group living in what is now Eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
"Paraguay, formerly called the 'Giant Province of the Indies,' originated in the 16th century after the Spanish conquistadors encountered its indigenous groups."
The Spanish began the period of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the city of Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has, with effort, retained much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is renowned for having one of the best polo teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches also take place here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where you can buy tickets for polo games, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which is set as equivalent to 1 pound sterling (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and U.S. dollars are also frequently accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, although they will likely accept British and American currency; contact the owners in advance to find out what payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland pounds outside the country, so you must exchange them before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, temperatures frequently reach over 30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the presence of wind and high humidity combine to make the perceived chill more intense than the thermometer indicates.
"There are no particularly 'rainy' or 'dry' seasons: the amount of precipitation remains roughly the same throughout the entire year."
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and must not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you must maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may seem, the bison, moose, bear, and almost all other large animals can attack humans.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not maintain the correct distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so it's best to give them their space.
In addition, be aware that smells can attract bears and other wild animals, so it would be advisable to avoid strong-smelling foods and maintain cleanliness at the campsite.
Apia is the capital of the state of Samoa. The city is located on Upolu Island and has a population of nearly 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of the state of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a sorrowful naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the fight for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, thanks to the fact that Auckland is located between two harbors. The most famous of these are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district), located on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost all sandy beaches, where it is safe to swim, and most have shade from pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the waterfront suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers from central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches, with a wide range of shops lined along the shore. You can swim safely.
The main local beer is "Number One"; it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
Many French wines can be found, but the New Zealand or Australian ones would go better.
The local tap water is drinkable, but if you have concerns you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is unusual. A short black coffee is "espresso," cappuccino comes topped with whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets the Belgian quality standards. The fruit juices are pricey, but very good.
Many visit the reef throughout the entire year, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, respect all signs and pay increased attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and near river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. Occasionally, it may be encountered outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are scared of people and would swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actually live in the ocean, as their main habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they reach their destination.
Travel agents often have arrangements with certain hotels, but through a travel agent you can also make reservations for other types of accommodation, such as camping sites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport to and from the airport, or even packages that combine flights and hotel accommodation.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests must be addressed primarily to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, the vast majority of participants in music festivals choose to camp on site, and most participants consider this an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will need to arrive early to get a camping spot near the music.
Remember that, although the music on the main stages has ended, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the Northern Baltic Sea during winter, pay attention to the cabin location, as navigating through ice produces an unbearable noise for the most sensitive.
Cruises from St. Petersburg also include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the obligation to obtain a visa (see conditions).
As a general rule, casinos make every effort to maximize the time clients spend there and the money they spend. Usually, there are no windows and clocks, and the exits can be hard to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the good mood and ensure the guests stay in the venue.
Some venues offer complimentary alcoholic beverages. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and good players know how important it is to stay clear-headed.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or through mountain passes must consider the possible presence of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On the icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as on dry asphalt.
During the blizzard, in a very short time, enough snow can fall to block you.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation, or the formation of ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic runs mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is likely the main tourist attraction of Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari, as commonly used, refers to overland journeys undertaken to see the astonishing wildlife of Africa, especially those in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, tend to approach cars, and the standard equipment will allow for good viewing of them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you will be able to see them better using binoculars.
"A walking safari (also called 'bush walk,' 'safari hike,' or 'on foot') consists of hikes, either for a few hours or for several days."
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo, which also hosted the 1964 Olympics, will be the only Asian city to have hosted two summer Olympics.
If you booked plane tickets and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might be facing a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March, coronavirus-related cancellation policies did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board that you can borrow, even if they are not available in the room.
If you don't have an iron available or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer if you have one at hand.
Be careful not to let the material get too hot (which can cause shrinking or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against certain specific threats.
In some areas, it is enough to boil the water for one minute, in others, several minutes are necessary.
The filters differ in terms of efficiency, and if you are concerned, consider the option of buying the water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests with which they are not familiar at home.
Pests can alter food, can cause irritations, or, in severe cases, can trigger allergic reactions, can spread venom, or can transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a human using physical force are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping offers you the opportunity in certain places to purchase goods exempt from duties and excises.
Travelers who are about to visit countries with high taxes can sometimes save considerable amounts, especially when it comes to products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult traffic conditions on the entire stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated and undeveloped areas.
If you're used to driving on country roads, don't lose control: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and dangerous curves prevail.
Speed limits are significantly lower than those in previous sections – generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and it is all the more important that they are strictly adhered to.
However, quite bizarrely, the mobile phone service is much stronger here than along many other portions of the route, e.g. Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Pastries with fruit are common, with apples being used throughout the year, and cherries and plums making their appearance in the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Often, popular cakes go very well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, taste what are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "dry" or "liquid" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and in Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry sauces; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a general term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines throughout the country.
When used without other qualifiers, however, the term tends to indicate food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a variety of dishes spiced with simplicity, with the predominant flavors preferred by the Javanese being peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups support the rider's feet, hanging on either side of the saddle.
These provide the rider with better stability, but they can pose safety issues, as it's possible for a rider's feet to get stuck in them.
If a rider falls from the saddle but remains with one foot caught in the stirrup, the horse can drag him along when it bolts. To minimize this risk, a series of precautionary measures can be taken.
First and foremost, most riders wear riding boots with heels and a smooth, narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leathers to detach from the saddle if they are pulled backward by a rider falling from the saddle.
Cochamó Valley - the most sought-after climbing spot in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of high granite walls and peaks.
The peaks offer breathtaking views from their summits. Climbers from all over the world continuously map out new routes among the walls with unlimited potential.
Sports that involve descending on snow, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding down snow-covered terrain using skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
"Skiing is a major tourist activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes called 'ski bums' in English, who organize entire vacations around skiing in a particular location."
The idea of skiing is extremely old – we have cave paintings depicting skiers from before the year 5000 BCE!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational skiing club in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also known as off-piste skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is a related activity, but it usually does not involve alpine skiing or mountaineering tours, the latter being conducted on much steeper terrains and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you will manage to cover somewhat longer distances than by walking – but very rarely will you be able to reach typical cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on your back, on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, crossing several countries would mean going through the procedures of obtaining a visa and passport control repeatedly.
In this sense, the Schengen Area is organized in a way like a single country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross the borders without having to do so at passport control points.
Similarly, anyone with a Schengen visa does not need to obtain a visa for each individual Schengen member country, thus saving time, money, and documentation.
There is no universal definition that establishes which produced articles are antiques. Some tax agencies consider antiques to be items older than 100 years.
The definition varies based on geographical location, where the age limit might be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important source of income among the Sami, and the culture related to trade is also important for many who have other professions.
However, traditionally not all members of the Sámi population have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but have lived from fishing, hunting, and the like, using reindeer more as draft animals.
Nowadays, many Sámi have modern occupations. Tourism is an important source of income for Sápmi, the Sámi area.
"Although it is widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the word 'țigan' is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and an incorrect perception of the Roma population."
If the country you are about to visit is subject to a travel warning, it might affect your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
You may also want to consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
An example would be how American citizens in the Middle East might encounter different situations compared to Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is just a brief summary of a country's political situation.
Opinions are often presented in a superficial, general, and overly simplified manner compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Extreme weather conditions" is a generic term used for any type of hazardous meteorological phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruptions, or loss of human lives.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world and come in various forms, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and uncontrolled fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as well as storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are advised to be cautious of the severe weather risks affecting the area, as they could disrupt their travel plans.
It is advisable for anyone planning to travel to a country that may be considered a war zone to receive professional training.
An Internet search for "hostile environment course" will likely provide you with the address of a local company.
Normally, a course will address all the issues discussed here in much greater detail, usually through practical experience.
A course will usually last between 2-5 days and will include role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
There are quite a few books and magazines that deal with wilderness survival, but publications that cover war zones are few.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery in another country must ensure they possess valid documents for the return journey.
The openness of governments to the possibility of issuing passports that do not declare sex (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and sex is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies just as much.
Searches at checkpoints have also become much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals who haven't yet undergone surgery should not expect to pass through scanners without their privacy and dignity being affected.
Rip currents represent the return flow to the ocean from the waves breaking on the beach, often at a reef or a similar formation.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and there a rapid current can form towards the deep waters.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion when trying to swim back against the current, which can prove to be impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming is no more difficult than usual.
Try to move towards a position where you are not caught again, and depending on the skills you have and whether or not someone has seen you, you may want to wait to be rescued.
The shock of returning home manifests more quickly than culture shock (the euphoria of the honeymoon phase persists less), has a longer duration, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to the new culture sometimes encounter particular difficulties in readjusting to their native culture.
If you had returned home after living abroad, you would have already adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits from your native culture.
When you had just gone abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, being aware that visiting a new country involves a process of adaptation.
The world does not always expect that patience and understanding are necessary even for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show organized at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in the entire area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually, you can constantly hear the noise made by tourists and vendors. The sound and light show seems like it's straight out of a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with sixteen being active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
The region in the southern part of the peninsula, which is bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea, is called Ellsworth Land.
The mountains of the Peninsula join to give rise to this plateau, then split again to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, called the Sentinel Range, are the tallest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson rising to 4,892 m.
In isolated places without phone signal, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone generally cannot take the place of a cell phone because you need to be outside with an unobstructed view of the satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used in maritime transport, including by recreational boats, as well as by expeditions requiring remote transmission of data and voice.
The local telephone service provider might give you more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly common alternative for people planning a gap year is to combine travel with study.
It is a popular activity especially among graduates, allowing them to take a gap year before attending university without jeopardizing their educational path.
In many cases, enrolling in a year of deferred courses abroad can even increase your chances of gaining admission to higher education in your home country.
Normally, there is a tuition fee that is paid upon enrollment in these educational programs.
"Finland is a wonderful place for rowing. 'The Land of a Thousand Lakes' also has thousands of islands, both in these lakes and in the archipelagos along the coast."
In archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the archipelagos off the coast and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national recreational activity, with one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
This happens in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands, the figure is from one to forty).
Most dedicated Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for several whole days, returning to the ship at night to sleep.
If you only go ashore on excursions from a ship, you won't need a separate visa (starting in 2009).
Some cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is by no means close to the sea, and the visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if flying for the first time or having had a traumatic experience.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from personal fears and dislikes of other things, which are exhibited by very many people.
For some, understanding something about how an aircraft works and what happens during a flight can be helpful in overcoming the fear that is based on the unknown or on the lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast deliveries. Often, delivery time is essential when it comes to documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies own their own planes, but other routes and the smaller companies had a problem.
If they sent something by air, on some routes it can take days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to make it go faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations will not allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a large stack of money for this privilege (or, even better, to convince your company to do this for you).
However, it is not cheap: generally, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class, and up to eleven times more for first class!
In general, it's not even worth looking for discounts for business class or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, a context in which they charge rates according to the demands.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from an inter-ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in the eastern area of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member country.
The economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been restored, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The dominant religion of Moldova is Eastern Orthodoxy.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey, with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the second port after Istanbul, and an excellent transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a bustling, developed, and modern commercial center, located around an enormous gulf and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, along with the glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centers, are equipped with traditional red tile roofs from the 18th century, as well as old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that is more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves above some graves.
It's worth spending half an hour walking through this amazing village.
To the north, easily accessible, lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous beyond the country's borders following an enthusiastic review of its splendors by Lord Byron.
The Scottburb 403 bus runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the northern part, you can visit the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a place known worldwide for the apparitions of St. Mary.
Please note that, in principle, you are visiting the site of a mass grave, as well as a site that holds almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
Many men and women who survived being interned there are still alive, and many more had family members who were killed or forced to work to death there, both Jews and others.
You are asked to treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not vandalize the place by drawing and making scratches on the existing structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understands it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only made in Catalan, because it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is widely used in public transportation, alongside other services.
Periodic announcements on the metro are made only in Catalan, but unexpected interruptions are announced by an automated system in various languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
"Although it is often just a stereotype not aligned with reality, to have an enjoyable stay in Paris, it's good to behave as well as possible, like someone who is 'bien élevé' (well-mannered). It will help you manage much more easily."
The reserved attitude of Parisians quickly turns into a friendly one if you show a minimum of politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and has a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It hosts a considerable variety of plant communities, thanks to its range of microclimates, different soil types, and altitude levels.
The region also shelters an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie can be found here, along with many other more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide coverings for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men must wear trousers that cover their knees.
And these can be borrowed from those available at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all for men!
The cuisine of Majorca, like that of similar Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, greens, and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used abundantly.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in the summertime, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil and tomatoes, with any available toppings, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie, which means you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of the sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
Also, without a doubt, it makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the necessity of discovering the possibility that a verb or an adjective might be used in a nominalized form.
The pronunciation of Italian words is relatively easy, most of them being pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters you need to pay more attention to are c and g, because their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel that follows them.
Also, be careful to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means car.
The Persian language has a relatively easy and generally regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar manual will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand the sentences.
Obviously, anyone who knows a Romance language will learn Portuguese more easily.
However, people who know a bit of Spanish might prematurely conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it does not need to be studied.
Pre-modern observatories are generally outdated nowadays and remain open as museums or educational sites.
Since during their heyday light pollution was not as big a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or campuses, being more easily accessible than those built in our times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities located in isolated areas with favorable weather conditions.
Viewing cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been an integral part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the chosen flowers.
In Japan, the first parties dedicated to cherry blossoms were hosted by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy of the Imperial Court.
Plants look nowhere better than in their natural environment, so don't fall prey to the temptation of picking even "just one" of them.
If you visit a formally landscaped garden, collecting "specimens" will also result in your expulsion without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place, where you can easily find your way and buy almost anything as soon as you arrive there.
"But being in the 'upper tropics,' just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to face both the heat (always) and the strong sun (when it's clear, more rarely)."
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the place where, according to tradition, the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were buried alongside their wives.
Check if the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not to Kiryat Arba, the nearby Jewish settlement.
Internal waterways can be a good theme for organizing a vacation.
For example, visiting castles on the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or taking a cruise to sites on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions related to this holiday have been adopted both by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake, outdoors, to watch the sunrise.
For this tradition, there are of course explanations in Christian theology, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening during Holy Week, with congregations often gathering at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, resulting in the giant tortoise being the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit areas in the Arctic or Antarctica during the winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be, more or less, dark at that time.
Because the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore not often a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more strongly hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are accustomed to.
Suits represent the standard attire in the business environment, and coworkers address each other using last names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is an essential element, with emphasis placed on group effort rather than individual achievements.
Workers often have to obtain approval from their superiors for all the decisions they make, and they are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
