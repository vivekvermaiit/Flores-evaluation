One treatment that uses antibodies, called ZMapp, has shown that it can cure the disease, but later studies found that it cannot prevent people from dying in the way they intended.
When they conducted a test called PALM, ZMapp was used as a 'control', which means that the scientists used it as a 'baseline' to compare how the other treatments performed in relation to it.

This shows that indeed some of the dinosaurs had bird-like feathers, a theory that many people have, but this provides information that fossils cannot give, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the color of the fur of this animal is 'chestnut-brown' on top with a 'pale' or 'carotenoid-colored' underside.
This research also provides some ideas on how feathers grow.
Because the feathers of birds found in dinosaurs did not have a well-developed shaft, which is called a rachis, but they did possess two other features of bird feathers—barbs and barbules—the team conducting this research hypothesized that this rachis developed later in the evolution of these dinosaur-borne bird feathers.
The structure of these bird feathers indicates that their function is not just for flying, but also for regulating their body temperature and displaying their colors to others. The lead researchers believe that, although this is a tail of a young dinosaur, this sample shows the feathers of a large dinosaur and not those of a baby dinosaur.
The team leading the research believes that, even though this is a young dinosaur's tail, it indicates that feathers were not as common on large dinosaurs as they were on juvenile dinosaurs.
A bomb was placed in a car and exploded at the main police office in Gaziantep, Turkey, on Monday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.

They discovered that the Sun behaves like other large stars: This activity of all the stars in the system is what they found as 'luminosity' and 'rotation' which causes them to spin around, and nothing else.
This 'luminosity' and 'rotation' are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, and this has a relationship with 'plasma flow'.
If the Rossby number is small, the magnetic reversal of this star will not be very active.

The work they did was to come up with some concepts, but they wrote this program to show the things they observed in the Sagittarius galaxy.
Something that this team is looking for is the forces of attraction between the 'dark matter' of this 'galaxy' and the 'dark matter' of the Milky Way 'galaxy'.
Just like the moon has a force that pulls the earth towards it, causing tides, the Milky Way also has a force that pulls the Sagittarius galaxy towards it.
Scientists cannot come to an agreement on whether 'dark matter' interacts with other 'dark matter' in the same way that all 'matter' does.
This theory of science says that a lot of dark matter in the galaxy surrounds the galaxy like a halo, and it contains many small particles.

In France, the process of voting does not involve the use of technology: voters usually go to a table, take a pre-printed paper showing the candidates they want to choose, and place it in an envelope.
When the officers have checked the name and place of this voter, the voter will put the envelope inside the 'ballot box' and mark their presence on the list of those who came to choose their candidates.
The law in France regarding elections says that they must put 'codes' in the work of selecting candidates.
Since 1988 up to now, all ballot boxes must be visible and both voters and election officials should ensure that there are no envelopes at the start of voting and that no additional envelopes are placed among the ones that have already been counted, all overseen by those with authority over the election.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the afternoon, volunteers count the votes and there are groups that follow the procedures to supervise their work.

About 3 minutes after they launched it into space, a camera on it showed that various pieces of insulation foam were breaking off the fuel tank.
However, they do not think that this thing causes the damage to the shuttle.
NASA Shuttle Program Manager N. Wayne Hale Jr. said that foam fell off "after we had spent a lot of time thinking about it."
Five minutes into this 'display', a wind started to blow, and one minute later, the wind reached a speed of 70 km/h... then the rain came, but it fell very heavily and the drops were very large, hitting your skin like a needle, then hail fell from the sky like stones, and people were frightened, shouting and running onto one another.
I lost my sister and her friend, and when I went to the place there were two people sitting in wheelchairs, and people carried them and just pushed them.
The NHK also reported that the Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear power plant in Niigata province is operating well.
Hokuriku Electric Power Co. reported that there are no signs of an earthquake and the Number 1 and Number 2 reactors at the Shika nuclear power plant are shut down.
They reported that nearly 9,400 houses in this region do not have water, and almost 100 of them do not have electricity.
Some of the roads are damaged, there is no train service in the areas affected by the earthquake, and Noto Airport in Ishikawa province is still closed.
A bomb exploded outside the governor-general's office.
Three bombs exploded near the government buildings within two hours.
Some reports say that the number of those who died is eight, and reports from offices say that 30 people were injured; but the true number is not yet known.
Cyanuric acid and melamine were found in the urine samples of pets that died after eating the animal food that was poisoned.
These two compounds react together to form crystals that can block the kidney from performing its function, the researchers at the university say.
Researchers have found that these 'crystals' form in cat urine when they add 'melamine' and 'cyanuric acid'.
The composition of this crystal is similar to those found in the urine of animals that eat this food when analyzed using infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).
I don't know if you are aware of this or not, but many of the goods coming from Central America enter the country 'duty-free'.
However, the customs duties for our cargo are subject to tariffs in the countries of Central America.
I cannot fully understand this; it is not right.
I want to tell everyone that you treat us the same way we have treated you.
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a bill making it a law that prohibits the sale, rental, or giving of fighting games to children.
This 'bill' says that video games for fighting sold in California must be labeled with a 'decal reading' "18" and those who break this law must pay $1000 each time they violate it.
Director of Public Prosecutions, Kier Starmer QC, gave a statement this morning announcing that they will prosecute Huhne and Pryce.
Huhne has resigned and Ed Davey MP will take his place in the Cabinet. Norman Lamb MP will take over the role of Business Minister that Davey will leave.
Time for Huhne and Pryce to appear at Westminster Magistrates Court is on February 16.
The people who died are Nicholas Alden, 25, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21. Cuddeback was driving the car.
Edgar Veguilla sustained damage to his upper arm and jawbone, and Kristoffer Schneider will need reconstructive surgery on his face.
Uka's fighting technique did not work when he aimed at the head of the fifth man. Schneider could feel pain, half of his face couldn't see, and some bones of his head and face are made of 'titanium'.
Schneider gave a testimony in a video at a USAF center in his country.
After the race that took place in Trinde, Carpanedo competed alone in two other races in this Championships.
His number one race was in the Slalom, where he got a Did Not Finish in his first run. 36 out of the 116 participants got the same result in this race.
Another of her races, the Giant Slalom, she finished tenth in the 'women's sitting group' with a run time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first place woman Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 behind the ninth place woman Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
The four female skiers in the 'women's sitting group' did not finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 competitors in the Giant Slalom did not receive a 'rank' in this race.
Madhya Pradesh Police found this laptop and mobile phone that were stolen.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped this Swiss woman and took her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the people who committed this crime are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that these men covered their faces when they appeared in court.
Even though three people were inside the house when the car hit, none of them got hurt.
However, the car driver suffered serious injuries to the head.
The road where this crash happened was closed for a short time and emergency services removed the driver from the red Audi TT.
First, he stayed at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
And then they sent him to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was at Edinburgh Sheriff Court and they charged her with killing her son.
He is in custody and is awaiting indictment and trial, but one piece of eyewitness evidence is not enough to change anything because his story has already been published by the news.
This comes up in all parts of the UK, but Scottish justice is different, and courts have viewed the publication of photos as an expression of some people's opinions, which is not true.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee said that "journalists can put themselves at risk if they publish photos and things like that of suspects."
Crown Office, which oversees all prosecutions, told journalists that there would be no further comment until the indictment.
The information made public spoke about the conflicts arising at the borders, where Palestine wanted the borders that existed before the 1967 Mideast War.
The other topics that this report discusses are the status of Jerusalem as a holy place for both countries and the issues of the Jordan Valley.
Israel wants to have a military presence in the Valley for at least ten years when they sign this agreement, and the PA agrees to stop such military activities for only five years.
The shooters involved in this supplementary pest control test are overseen by the rangers, because they are monitoring and assessing its effectiveness.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers are recruited under the 'hunting program' of the Sporting Shooters Association.
Acting Director Park Conservation and Heritage, Mick O'Flynn, along with NPWS, said that these four 'shooters', who were selected to conduct the first 'shooting operation', received proper guidance regarding safety and training.
Martelly conducted the swearing-in of nine members of a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) on Tuesday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission made a recommendation that the former CEP must resign as part of the country's move towards new elections.
This commission is something that Martelly initiated because of the 'anti-regime' protests that have been occurring everywhere and started in October.
These protests sometimes result in anger and fights and they are happening because an election has not been held, some of which were supposed to happen in 2011.
Around 60 reports of iPods malfunctioning because they overheated, resulting in six fires in total that caused four people to suffer 'minor burns'.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it has been aware of 27 accidents caused by this device.
English sentence: Last week, METI revealed that Apple had informed them of 34 more incidents of 'overheating', which the company described as "not a big issue."
This minister expressed his opinion when he described Apple's practice of not reporting promptly as "not good at all."
This earthquake occurred in Mariana at 07:19 a.m local time (09:19 p.m GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas office that manages emergencies says that no damage has occurred in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said that there is no sign indicating a tsunami will occur.
A Filipino man who had previously worked as a police officer held some tourists from Hong Kong hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital city of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 gun at the tourists.
They retrieved some of the people who were held and six of them died.
Six of them, who were holding on, with children and elders among them, were released first, along with the Filipinos accustomed to taking photos with cameras.
A group of photographers took over the place of a prominent woman because she wanted to go to the toilet. They shot Mendoza with a gun and he died.
Liggins followed his father and got a job in the medical field.
He received training to become an obstetrician and started working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
When he worked at the hospital Liggins began conducting investigations into 'premature labour' during his time there.
Her research shows that if they give a certain hormone, it can cause the foetal lung of the baby to grow faster.
Xinhua reported that in Trinde, government workers conducting an investigation found the two 'black boxes' that record everything happening inside the plane.
The other groups who usually play wrestling expressed their condolences to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the number one Queen of Extreme. She was my number one manager. Luna left us on the night of the new moon. This is something different yet the same as her way. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said, "Luna used to do all kinds of things like me… maybe she outdid me… I loved her and miss her… I believe she is in a good place."
Inside of 1,400 people who gave their opinions before the 2010 election, those who opposed the idea of Australia becoming a 'republic' rose by 8 percent compared to the number in 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the campaign period for the 2010 government election that she believes Australia should become a 'republic' when Queen Elizabeth II is no longer ruling their country.
34 percent of the people in this poll think that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last queen of Australia.
In the extremes of this poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic soon, while 31 percent believe Australia should not become a republic.
This man who won the gold medal will swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his complaints about fitness, they do not know if he will compete.
He was unable to get the drugs he needed to alleviate his pain because the Games prohibited these drugs.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered a very large prime number on January 25.
Some people used various kinds of hardware and software starting in February to check if it was correct and reported this on Monday.
It looks like comets have brought some substances that produce water along with other organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists want to clearly understand how planets are formed, but more importantly they want to know how Earth was formed, when comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, who is 53 years old, began his role as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month that legalized same-sex marriage.
He spoke of empty words as "political rhetoric and the behavior of those without good sense."
They thought he wanted to run again to become president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow planes to fly shorter routes and save many million gallons of fuel every year and reduce the amount of carbon that goes into the air.
He uses satellite-based technology and not ground-radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to properly track aircraft and provide accurate information to pilots.
There is no other transport on the ground and the trains that run above ground will stop at Wembley, and the place to park cars and make 'park-and-ride' will not be able to open.
The lack of transport makes it look like this game will be played in a place where no supporters can go.
A study published in a journal called Science provides information on a new species of bird located in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported on a new species that emerged within two generations, but they believe this process took a longer time, occurring because of breeding between the Darwin's finch of the area, Geospiza fortis, and the cactus finch from another area, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into many different forms. And it can be rolled to create small shapes.
They can pull it and make it into a small wire rod, which they can twist and fasten. They can hammer it or roll it to make sheets.
They can make it become very soft and pliable, and stick it onto other metals. Sometimes they can make it very soft and use it for decorating pictures that are hand-painted and inside books that are called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is what they call the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using the red juice of cabbage.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on how much acid or basic (alkaline) is present in the chemical.
The mark of Hydrogen (this H in pH) 'ion' inside the chemical that they test will show the level of pH.
The 'ions' of Hydrogen are 'protons' from which the 'electrons' have been removed (because a Hydrogen 'atom' has one 'proton' and one 'electron').
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with a clean and wet hand, squeeze them to make one ball.
This water on your hand will react with the layers that are outside, which will feel different and create a kind of cell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet that used water in almost every house, and all were connected to another kind of 'sewage system'.
The ancient things that show these 'sewage systems' were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were toilets from ancient times in Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman part, the toilets were like part of public bathhouses where men and women used to gather together.
When you call some people who are thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
This satellite in space received the call and sent it back down immediately.
This satellite is a rocket that has been sent to space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere often changes some of the lights we see and how we see things.
They use a giant rocket that is more than 100 feet long to place a telescope in space.
This wheel has changed the world in various ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is it has given us this 'transportation' that can move faster.
He gives us trains, cars, and many other machines for transportation.
Among them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized animals ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Lastly, there are many small cats (including the ones we take care of at home) that eat small creatures such as insects, rats, lizards, and birds.
The secret of how they manage to stay well is this thing they call 'niche', a special task each cat knows how to do and it doesn't compete with others.
Lions are cats that like to live with other cats, and they live in large groups called 'prides'.
The 'pride' usually has one that goes up to the number of three people, with something like thirty women and children.
The women, they come from one family, like a big family of sisters and their daughters.
Lion prides behave in the same way as packs of wolves or dogs, these animals which are similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and they also pose a significant threat to other animals they prey on.
A good athlete, the tiger can climb (it's not very good at climbing), swim, jump to great heights, and pull things with strength that is five times more than the strength of a man.
The tiger is part of the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's "roar" is similar to the "full-voiced roar" of a lion, but it is almost like a sentence of a person taking in air when they are angry and yelling.
Ocelots often like to eat small animals. They can catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds if they can catch them. Almost all the animals that ocelots can find are smaller than them.
Scientists think that ocelots follow and search for other animals to eat (try to eat) when they smell something, they pick up their scent from the areas where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with 'night vision', and they also know how to move very quietly. Ocelots can find their food by hiding with things in the environment and jumping on the animals they want to catch.
When a small group of animals (a small number) leaves the larger population from which they came (if they move up a mountain or a small river, or if they move to a new island and find it difficult to return), they will find themselves in a different environment that is not the same as before.
This new environment has various resources and different competitions, so this new population will need other means to become stronger than where they were before.
This other population has not changed, but they need to make the same kind of changes to their environment as before.
After some time, this new population began to adapt and learn to live in their new environment, they started to look slightly different from the other population.
He will continue to go, and after several thousand or million years, these two populations will look different, and all the groups will not say they are one 'species'.
We call this process 'speciation', which means the formation of a new 'species'. 'Speciation' is something we cannot avoid and it is an important part of 'evolution'.
Plants can produce oxygen that we humans inhale, and they can absorb carbon dioxide that we humans exhale from our bodies (this happens when the air we inhale goes out).
Many plants can make their own food through a process known as photosynthesis. They can provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make our clothes from plants. Many of the foods we eat are plants. If there were no plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus were the top predators at that time, and no other animal could eat them, so they were not afraid of anything. They were only afraid of other mosasaurus.
His mouth has more than 70 teeth that are sharp like razors, along with another row of teeth on the roof of the mouth. This means whatever it catches will not be able to escape.
We may never know, but perhaps it had four sharp teeth. It could eat turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and perhaps even humans too.
He can eat everything that goes into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex can't match him.
Although we can know many of their foods, the Romans had foods we do not know about or used for big feasts, one of which is wild boar, peacock, snail, and a type of rodent they call dormouse.
Another thing that is different is when people who do not have much eat their plain meals while sitting on chairs, wealthy people like to have big gatherings with a feast where they can lounge and eat.
People from ancient Rome did not have food that came from America or Asia, which are now in Europe several hundred years later.
One example is that they did not have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cacao, and none of the people from ancient Rome had ever tasted turkey.
The people of Babylon built a great temple for each of their gods, which they considered to be the house of that god.
Men and women will bring things to offer to the gods, and the priests will try to meet what the gods need when they perform ceremonies and large religious gatherings.
Each temple has a place to sit outside and a place inside where only priests can enter.
Sometimes they build special towers that are shaped like pyramids, and they call them 'ziggurats', which are part of the temples.
On top of this tower are some special places of this god.
In the hot places of the Middle East, houses are not important.
Many things in the lives of Hebrew families usually happen outside the home.
Women usually cook food outside beside the house; the stalls are tables that are open and look out to the road. They usually use stones to build the houses.
There were no large trees in the land of the Canaanites, so wood was very expensive.
There are not many people living in Greenland. In the ancient stories of the Norwegians, they say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland because he had killed a man, and when he traveled west, he found Greenland and gave it this name.
However, even if he found this place, there were already Eskimos living there during that time.
Even though each country is considered 'Scandinavian', there are many differences among the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you will think that they wrote a 'treasure map' on the back of the Declaration of Independence paper.
However, this is not true. Even if there is something written on the back of a document, this is not a 'treasure map'.
They wrote these words on the back of the Declaration of Independence paper "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". This writing is located at the bottom of the document, and it is 'upside down'.
When no one knows who wrote these pieces of text, they understand that when it was still new, this large 'parchment' document (its size is 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Therefore, it seems that this piece of text that was written later can remain as a 'label'.
The D-Day landings and other battles freed the northern part of France, but the southern part was not yet free.
This area was controlled by the "Vichy" French. These were the French people who made 'peace' with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with those who came to take over their country and did not fight against them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies captured the southern part of France in the battle they called "Operation Dragoon".
Within just two weeks, the American soldiers and the Free French liberated the southern part of France and started moving towards Germany.
A 'civilization' is a culture where a large group of people who know how to live together and work together share, it is a 'society'.
This part of the word 'civilization' comes from a Latin word 'civilis', which means 'civil', and it is similar to another Latin word 'civis', which means 'citizen', and 'civitas', which means city or 'city-state', and this also speaks about the size of 'society'.
City-states are entities that can form a country. Within a civilizational culture, people pass on their knowledge to several generations, creating a cultural footprint that persists and serves as a pathway for transmitting knowledge to others.
Usually, small cultures disappear quickly and do not leave evidence of their history, so scholars do not regard them as true civilizations.
During the time of the Revolutionary War, initially the thirteen states formed a central government that was not strong—where Congress was just one component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress does not have the power to make and collect taxes, and because there was no 'national executive' or 'judiciary', it would use 'state authorities', who often do not cooperate with it, to make people follow its 'act'.
Also, he does not have the authority to change the 'tax laws' and 'tariffs' between the 'states'.
Articles need the people to agree on all states before they can make changes and the states get central government representation, so the appointed people are often unrepresented.
The national football team of Italy, along with the national football team of Germany, are both very good second-ranked teams in the world, and they became the champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
The sports that many people are familiar with are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are well-known in the Northern regions, and those in Italy participate in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has 7,000 islands (the largest island is Honshu), and this makes Japan the seventh largest island country in the world.
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, people refer to Japan, in terms of geography, as an "archipelago."
The island of Taiwan was discovered in the 15th century when European sailors came across it and recorded its name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a center in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a change in the method of grain production as they employed Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, soldiers of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) occupied and took over the 'western' and 'northern' coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the fight in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded the power over Taiwan to Japan, who controlled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three large structures, their names are Intihuatana, Temple of the Sun, and Room of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings that are located on the edge of this structure were rebuilt to help tourists understand what kind this structure looked like in the past.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been rebuilt, and they are still working on restoring it up to today.
For example, the 'still image photography' format that many people know is 35mm, which was the leading size of 'film' after the era of 'analog film'.
They made it themselves today, but more importantly, its 'aspect ratio' is like the ones used by 'digital camera image sensor' format.
The 35mm format can confuse people, it has a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The 'aspect ratio' of this format (they divide it with twelve to get a small whole-number ratio) and they say this 'ratio' is 3:2.
Many of the formats that people use (for example, the APS family of formats) are the same or similar to this 'aspect ratio'.
This 'rule of thirds' that many people often misunderstand and joke about is a simple 'guideline' that helps create a good photo and bring some order within an image.
He said a good place for a subject is in the time of taking a photo where the lines divide the picture into three parts 'vertically' and 'horizontally' (see example).
During this time, the Catholic Church had a lot of money and power, so they scrutinized it thoroughly.
For more than a thousand years, this religion of the Christians united the countries of Europe, even though they had their own languages and customs.
This great power of his brings about change to all people. Starting from the king down to the common people who have no name or rank.
One of the main beliefs of Christians is that they must use their money and wealth to help others who are suffering, in trouble, or lacking money and food. They believe that the church's money is for doing this work.
Rome has been primarily responsible for overseeing the work of the church for a thousand years, and a lot of power and money are in Rome. This has caused many people to have mixed feelings about whether it fulfills this belief or not.
Soon after the war started, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This plane of theirs is working well, they are stopping important supplies going to the military and civilians, despite this blockade breaking international law which was established under agreements from two centuries ago.
Britain placed bombs in the international waters to prevent ships from entering large sections of the sea, which also resulted in hostilities towards ships of other groups not involved in the conflict.
Because there was no response to this 'tactic', Germany thought the same thing would happen to its 'submarines'.
In the years of the 1920s, the main behavior of the citizens and countries was to achieve peace and unity and remain independent.
The countries have already witnessed the pain, suffering, and madness of the war that occurred during World War I, and they want to prevent such things from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to work with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a different way of representing various times; each 'stage' of China or each family that held power was a 'dynasty'.
And also, among each dynasty there were times when the provinces were independent. One of these periods that many people know about is the time of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these times, a big fight occurred among the many family members who had name and status, fighting for the throne.
Three Kingdoms is one of the periods of warfare in the history of Ancient China where many thousands of people died during the battles for dominance of the 'grand palace' in Xi’an.
There are many things happening in society and politics such as the use of the metric system, the change from absolutism to republicanism, and the idea of nationalism and belief in the country belong to the people and not just one person in control.
And also, after the Revolution, opportunities opened up for everyone to allow those who dream and work hard to do the good work they want to do.
This is similar to the military because now they don't receive a rank based on their family class, but they will receive a rank based on their behavior and what they are capable of doing.
The French Revolution inspired many other 'working class' people in other countries to start their own 'revolutions'.
Muhammad is interested in things that are greater than the things of this life. He often goes to a cave called "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) to stay and reflect.
This stone hole, which still exists, clearly illustrates the beliefs of Muhammad.
He is on top of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, this cave of stone is hidden from all parts of the world.
Truly, it is not easy to find it or know if it is there. When you are inside this stone cave, you are far away from everything else.
You can't see anything else, only the clear sky, which looks nice and is above, surrounded by many mountains. You can't see or hear anything from this world when you're inside this hole in the rock.
The 'Great Pyramid' in Giza is one of the 'seven wonders' that still stands today.
The people of Egypt built in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the large pyramid structures that they made to honor a Pharaoh who had died.
Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" inside the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, has several pyramids (the largest among them being the 'Great Pyramid'), some smaller tombs, some temples, and the 'Great Sphinx'.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many small pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor the women and family members of Khufu.
This "'up bow" mark' looks like a V and this "'down bow mark'" looks like a 'staple' or a 'square' without a bottom side.
'Up' means you must start at the 'tip' and push the 'bow', and 'down' means you must start at the 'frog' (which is where your hand holds the 'bow') and pull this 'bow'.
A single 'up-bow' produces a sound that is softer, while a 'down-bow' produces a sound that is stronger and has more force.
You can make your own marks with a pencil, but remember the 'bowing marks' that are already printed have significance, so you must respect them.
On the 6th day of October 1789, the market women forced King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two small children (Marie Therese who was 11 years old and Louis-Charles who was 4 years old) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris while they were at Versailles.
Inside a carriage, they rushed back to Paris as a large crowd of people angrily surrounded them, shouting and making various threatening remarks to intimidate the King and Queen.
The big crowd of angry people is forcing the King and Queen to leave the windows of their carriage open.
One time a man among the large group of people lifted and displayed the head of a 'royal guard' who was killed at Versailles in front of the Queen, and she was very shocked.
The cost of the war that the U.S. incurred when it wanted to take and hold the Philippines was actually paid by the people of the Philippines themselves.
They forced them to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S. to provide money for expenditures and interest on bonds that they used under the name of the government of the Philippines in the banks of Wall Street.
It is true that the large financial gains that emerge during times of crisis for the Filipino people will produce American financial powers to dominate other parts of the world.
To understand well the Templars, we must be clear about the background story that led to the creation of this group.
This time when everything happened is known as the High Middle Ages, a period in the history of Europe during the 11th, 12th, and 13th century (AD 1000–1300).
Before the High Middle Ages, there was the Early Middle Ages, and after that, there was the Late Middle Ages, which ended around the time of 1500.
'Technological determinism' is a term that encompasses various concepts people often practice, ranging from 'technology push' or 'technological imperative' to the idea that human behavior is to follow the laws of science and develop technologies that adhere to these scientific laws.
There are many ideas about the meaning of 'technological determinism' that contain two main thoughts: one is that the development of technology follows a path that culture and politics cannot change, and the other is that technology brings "change" to communities because these behaviors and thoughts are inherent to people and not created by technology.
For example, we can say that it is the car that makes the people build roads.
However, a road that goes to all parts of the country would be a waste of money because there are only a few cars, so new ways to build cars are being developed to lower the price of cars.
When many people have cars, many accidents can happen on the roads, this will lead to new techniques being developed within healthcare to fix injuries to the body.
Romanticism had a significant element of 'cultural determinism' within it, a concept that came from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In terms of Romanticism, the place people come from often shapes their behavior, and over time, customs and cultures associated with their place of residence emerge, and these will reflect the character of the people from that place, which is much better than laws borrowed from elsewhere and used without context.
In this way, Paris has become the number one place for various styles of clothing in the world today, but Constantinople was the number one city for various styles of clothing during the Middle Ages in Europe.
Many people know about it because it was the origin of a good lifestyle and it started around 400 A.D and ended around 1100 A.D.
In the twelfth century, its value decreased because the Crusaders returned and brought gifts such as silk and spices. The value of these items was higher than the value of things available in the Byzantine markets.
During this time, they took the name 'Fashion Capital' from the city of Constantinople and gave it to the city of Paris.
Gothic style became prominent between the 10th - 11th century and the 14th century.
First, this dress follows the style of Byzantine culture from the east.
However, because the process of communication takes time, fashion styles will linger for 25 to 30 years.
As the Middle Ages came to an end, 'western' Europe began to develop its own styles. One of the major developments that emerged during this time because of the 'Crusades' was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
'Subistence agriculture' is agriculture which people practice to produce food for the needs of their family.
'Subsistence agriculture' is a system that does not use a lot of inputs, does not use chemicals, uses seeds obtained from food crops that grow in the region, and combines these practices with methods like 'crop rotation' or other similar techniques to increase food production.
In the past, many farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and this method still exists in many countries that are not yet developed.
Subcultures can cause groups to feel that the standards of society do not apply to them, and when they come together they create their own identity.
Subcultures can vary greatly because of religion, place of origin, community status, location, and gender.
The things that make subcultures different can be language, fashion, religion, politics, sexuality, place, or a combination of these things.
Members of a subculture can show that they belong to it by using a certain style, such as the clothes they wear, the behavior they exhibit, and the language they use.
One of the methods that many people use to show that 'socialization' is important is by using stories of children who have been 'socialized' because their parents were not busy with them, leading to negative things happening in their lives or people mistreating them as they grow up.
This kind of children is often referred to as "feral" or wild children. Some 'feral' children are kept at home (often it is their own parents who do it); sometimes parents neglect this child because they have mental or physical disabilities.
The 'feral' children are those who have experienced some significant harm or 'trauma' before they ran away or their parents were not concerned about them.
Other 'feral' children are said to have been cared for by animals in the wild; some are said to have survived on their own in the forest.
When the animals take care of these children, these 'feral' children often exhibit behaviors similar to those of the animals that look after them, such as fear or lack of understanding of what to do when around other humans.
Never mind, 'project based learning' makes the way of learning easier and stimulates interest, 'scaffolding' enhances it further.
'Scaffolding' is not just a method of learning something, but it is a support that provides assistance to individual students who are learning something new, such as using a new computer or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can appear on computers or they can truly be inside the classroom, in other words, a teacher is a scaffold, but the paperclip man inside Microsoft Office is also a scaffold.
The scaffolds in the computer are part of the software and their role is to ask questions, give advice on what to do, and explain ways to do things that are difficult for students to understand on their own.
They usually place children in Foster Care because of various reasons such as 'neglect', to 'abuse', and forcing the child to do something to make money.
No child should be in an environment that is not good for them, does not care for them, and does not educate them, yet they often find themselves in such environments.
We see the Foster Care System as a place that is safe for these children.
The 'Foster Care System' is supposed to provide safe places for children to live, with people who can love and care for them, and good health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide everything that they did not have in the house they were taken from.
The internet can connect individual communication methods with the ways of communicating with many people.
These internet practices provide new knowledge on how we can use the internet and find enjoyment.
Example: "learning" and "socialization" are important motivations that make people want to use the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuing relationship" were identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new factors that motivate us to use the internet when they conducted a study on people's behavior on websites.
The use of video recording allows researchers to discover important things about the study of 'micro-expressions', the facial movements that occur within a few milliseconds.
"They say we can discover if a person is lying when we accurately find the meaning of their 'micro-expression'."
Oliver Sacks, in the paper he wrote The President's Speech, shows how people cannot understand the meaning of speech because they have some damage to their brains, but they can clearly understand if a person is telling the truth.
He also said that this kind of human ability to perceive the meaning of behavior is something that animals, such as the dogs we keep at home, also have.
Research from the 'Twentieth century' has shown that there are two 'pools' of 'genetic variation': one is hidden and one is apparent.
Mutation can create new genetic variation, and selection can remove it from the pool of expressed variation.
'Segregation' and 'recombination' cause this 'variation' to move back and forth between the two 'pools' within each 'generation'.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to obtain amino acids from plants available there.
And furthermore, if they can't do these things then major issues can arise: 'growth depression', 'malnutrition', and very serious outcomes such as death.
This plant that is in this place has 'protein' inside its leaves and beans, but it is hard for 'primates' like us to digest unless it is cooked first.
Another thing is that animal food (ants, termites, and eggs) is easy to eat, and also they provide a high protein value that contains all the amino acids that the body needs.
When we consider everything, we should not be surprised if their ancestors addressed their 'protein issues' in the same way that chimps in the savanna do today.
'Sleep interruption' is the act of waking up during sleep and going back to sleep for a short time afterward (10–60 minutes).
This is something you can do when you use a 'quiet alarm clock' to wake up gently without startling yourself.
If you see that you are doing a 'reset' on the clock during your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, this will make you get out of bed to turn it off.
Another option for 'biorhythm-based' is to drink plenty of water (such as water or tea, a 'diuretic') before you sleep, which will force you to get up and go to the bathroom.
The mark of peace is present within a person who has a connection, yet it is the opposite of the mark of burden that resides within the body and spirit of a person.
When the burden is small, there will be more positive energy in life. Everyone has the strength to truly find peace and happiness.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this core idea is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism follows the teachings of Buddha, but they make it even greater with the 'mahayana path of love' and also with many techniques of Indian Yoga.
Within the fundamental philosophy of Tibetan Buddhism, it is very peaceful. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, this Kundalini energy ('enlightenment energy') is activated through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The most important thing in 'Tibetan meditation' is Deity Yoga. Within the 'visualization' of various gods, the pathways of energy are purified, the 'chakras' become active, and the 'enlightenment' of the mind occurs.
Germany was treated as an enemy by many during World War 2, which led to an alliance between the USSR and the USA. When the war ended, a divide emerged between the systems, processes, and cultures, causing the countries not to work together.
Two years after the end of the war, the groups that had worked together became enemies and the Cold War began.
This war will last 40 years with fierce fighting by armies representing various countries, in battlegrounds from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the defense of Poland broke, and the only thing to do was to retreat and regroup at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were ruined that night, and more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and established a 'front' in Belarus and a 'front' in Ukraine after entering and occupying the 'eastern region' of Poland, an act that did not respect the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements made between the two countries and also among many other countries.
The practice of using ships to move things is the number one way to transport large amounts of cargo or people by sea.
The work of the navy is to ensure that your country can move goods and people, and also to prevent enemies from moving goods and people.
One good example that happened not long ago is the North Atlantic campaign during WWII. The Americans were trying to move cargo and men across the Atlantic Ocean to assist the British.
At the same time, the German 'navy' used U-boats and tried to prevent this from happening.
If the Allies hadn't done what they did, Germany probably would have captured and occupied Britain like it did with all parts of Europe.
People started caring for goats about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
The ancient customs and tribes began to take care of them to easily obtain milk, grass, meat, and their hides.
The animals called goats, which people take care of, are often kept in groups that move around small hills or other areas with food, and often 'goatherds' look after them along with the children of the important men, who are called 'shepherds'. These methods of looking after goats are still being used today.
The railways were built in England during the time of the '16th Century'.
Never mind the 'wagonways,' which are planks placed along the sides of the road, they make it so that the horses pulling them don't have to work as hard and can pull larger loads on roads that are not as rough as the usual roads of those days.
They first used 'crossties' to keep the 'track' in one place. Later, they realized that these 'tracks' would be better if there was a piece of iron on top of them.
This behavior is often done by many people, but it causes wear to the wagon wheel bearings.
Later, they replaced wooden wheels with iron wheels. In 1767, they made the first full-iron rails.
The number one form of transportation is walking; humans started walking on two legs two million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning 'upright man') appeared.
The people who existed earlier, the Australopithecines didn’t walk on two legs all the time.
The ability to walk on two legs is found in the fossils of Australopithecus, which existed 4.2-3.9 million years ago, but the Sahelanthropus were walking on two legs around seven million years ago.
We can start by living well with the environment, we can join an 'environmental movement', and we can become 'activists' to reduce the impact of problems that may arise in the future.
Often, this is similar to 'symptomatic treatment'. However, if we don't want a short-term solution, then we must find the root of the problem and stop it.
He is surprised to see that the world has truly changed due to new scientific and technological advances, and problems are becoming bigger because of the growing population and the lifestyle of people who have various significant things.
After Congress received this document on July 4, a handwritten copy signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to a printing shop owned by John Dunlop nearby.
In the middle of the night, they made around 150 to 200 copies, now they call them "Dunlap broadsides."
The first time they read this document in public, John Nixon read it outside Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his soldiers in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
25 Dunlop broadies are still there and they are very old copies of this document. This first document that they wrote by hand is damaged.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs is still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think that they are like dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are still many things about birds that look similar to dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they can walk on two legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all the computers they use today can change information into "code" of binary numbers.
A 'binary number' can have two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as 'binary digits' or 'bits' in computer language.
'Internal poisoning' does not easily present itself clearly. Symptoms like vomiting are significant signs when people cannot make a quick diagnosis.
The main thing that indicates 'internal poisoning' is the presence of an open container of medicine or household 'toxic chemical'.
Check the label on the first aid instructions for this poison.
This term 'bug' is used by entomologists to refer to this group of insects.
This phrase derives its meaning from Bed-bugs, those insects that tend to parasitize humans.
Assassin bugs and bed bugs are 'nidicolous', they live in the place where they were born or on something that can provide them with food.
In various parts of the United States of America, there are about 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the number one neurological disease among adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that the chance of women getting MS is twice as high as that of men.
A couple can make the decision that it is not good for them, it is not good for their child, if they have a baby.
These types of couples can decide to put their baby up for adoption.
Inside an adoption, the parents who give birth to the child will relinquish their rights as parents, and another family can take care of the child.
The basis of science is to discover how the world works using the scientific method. This method guides much of the scientific research.
He is not present yet, 'experimentation', and an 'experiment' is a 'test' they use to eliminate one or more of the ideas they have developed. The practice of asking questions and conducting studies also guides 'scientific research'.
People study 'nature', and the 'philosophers' study 'classical texts', such as the Bible in the Latin language.
The things that they approve are the ideas of Aristotle about science, along with psychology.
When the knowledge of the Greeks declined, the West abandoned Greek ideas in science and philosophy.
Many scientists have observed that rhythms that occur in the bodies and behaviors of animals and humans tend to follow cycles of things outside the body and the biological clock of the body.
Periodic rhythms do not occur only because of external factors, but studies have shown that they appear in many living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are things that can maintain themselves and can become electric currents that continue to run regardless of outside influences that might disrupt them.
Hershey and Chase's experiment is one of the things that indicates DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used 'phages', or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments where they labeled the DNA inside the phage with radioactive phosphorus or labeled the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can cause various things, and they occur due to different kinds of mutations, the important role of this genetic material, and whether these cells are germ-line cells.
Mutations that occur inside germ-line cells are the only ones that can be passed on to children, but mutations that occur elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
'Nature-based tourism' attracts people who are interested in seeing natural areas and enjoy seeing places, along with the plants and animals of that area.
Example of on-site activities is finding fish, taking photos, birdwatching, and walking in parks and studying information on ecosystems.
One example is going around, taking photos, and learning about 'orangutans' when you go to Borneo.
Every morning, all the people leave the small town when they get into vehicles to go to their workplaces, and they pass others whose places of work are in the very place they just left and came to.
Inside this transport shuttle, everyone is connected, and they support a transport system created by private cars.
Now science shows that this large 'carbon economy' is pushing the 'biosphere' out of a 'stable state' that has supported humanity for two million years.
All the people live within society and use the transportation system. Almost everyone tends to complain about the transportation system.
In the 'developed countries,' you won't be able to hear the same kind of complaints about water quality where bridges collapse.
Why do these transportation systems always produce such complaints, and why don't they work well every day? Do the transportation engineers not know how to do their jobs? Or, is there something bigger happening?
"Traffic Flow" is the study of the movement of individual drivers and cars between two points and what kind of things they do to each other.
However, the study of 'traffic flow' is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent accuracy.
However, drivers tend to act in a manner that is 'consistent,' thus, there is something 'consistent' about traffic and this can be demonstrated by experts using mathematics numbers.
To improve traffic flow, relationships must be established among three major things: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships aid in the planning, design, and operation of roadway facilities.
Insects are the number one animals that inhabit the air. Their ability to fly helps them avoid predators and easily find food and mates.
Many insects can fold their wings against their bodies, and this is a good thing.
This causes them to have many little places to hide from animals that want to eat them.
Today, the insects that cannot fold their wings are the dragonflies and the mayflies.
Several thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moves around the Sun.
Some people think it is correct, but many people believe the opposite; they believe the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and other stars as well).
This one looks correct because we don't feel like the Earth is moving, right?
Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest river by volume on Earth. It carries as much water as 8 times more than the second largest river.
And also, the Amazon is the number one river whose width is very large on Earth, and the width of it is six miles.
20 percent of the water that flows out of the rivers of the planet comes from the Amazon.
The big Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It usually collects water from many thousands of small rivers.
Stop all the practices of building pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, they did not surpass the skill and knowledge of those who built the pyramids of Giza.
The people of Egypt from the New Kingdom considered these buildings of their ancestors to be very unusual, at that time these 'pyramids' were over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. This is truly the smallest country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian as the official language within its laws and for making official communication.
Italian is the native language the people in the state know and use in everyday speech, and they use Latin for conducting religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about major chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper in the past because they found them in their native form in the environment, and they were easy to find with the tools from earlier times.
Aristotle, a philosopher, developed the idea that everything is made up of one or more of the four elements combined. These elements are earth, water, wind, and fire.
This is similar to the four 'states of matter' (and follows the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, and it also says that they change and create new things to make the things we see.
They allow things that have two or more metals inside them. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like 'calcium' and 'potassium' are regarded as metals. There are other metals too, such as silver and gold.
You can have alloys that contain small amounts of elements that are not metals, such as carbon, within them.
Everything inside the Universe is made up of 'matter'. All 'matter' contains tiny things within them called 'atoms'.
The 'atoms' are very, very small, and trillions of them can fit into one 'full stop' at the end of a sentence.
That's why the pencil has been a good friend to many people since it came into being.
However, when new methods of writing emerged, the pencil took a lower position and not many people used it.
Nowadays, people write information on computer screens, and they don't come close to a sharpener.
We can think about what things will appear on the keyboards when something new emerges.
A 'fission bomb' operates following the law that obtains energy and creates one 'nucleus' with many 'protons' and 'neutrons'.
It's just like you are trying to push a heavy object up a small mountain. The process of 'splitting nucleus' in turn releases some of this energy.
Some 'atoms' have 'unstable nuclei' and this means they can break even if you touch them lightly or don't touch them.
The surface of the Moon has rocks and dust. The 'outer layer' of the Moon is called the 'crust'.
Its crust is about 70 km thick on the side that is near and 100 km thick on the side that is far.
He is thinner towards the coast and thicker towards the highlands.
It looks like there will be more eruptions on the nearby side because the crust is thinner. It is easier for lava to come to the surface.
'Content theories' usually try to find out what things can motivate people or touch their emotions and thoughts.
These theories say that people have certain needs and desires that develop as they grow up.
These theories examine what internal factors make some people prefer the things they do and what external environmental factors will influence them to take action or not take action.
Two 'content theories' that many people know are Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
If we evaluate everything, two patterns emerge clearly when managers start to exceed their ranks. On one hand, they want to remain like "one of the boys (or women) in the group".
This type of manager often finds it difficult to make decisions that people don't like, provide advice to those who break the law, assess the performance of employees, assign tasks to employees, and directly tell employees when they make mistakes.
On the other hand, a manager changes and becomes someone whom the team does not know well, and feels like they must change everything the team is doing and do everything on their own strength.
After everything, it is the leader's job to ensure the team works well or not.
This behavior often causes conflict between the leaders and the teams.
Teams that work with computers can have the same standards for good work as those that work in an office, but there are some small differences.
All teams that work together with a computer function like a person who gathers groups working together in an office.
They can do things according to their own preferences during times when working within office hours, meeting with other team members at times suitable across different time zones, and this is something local managers might not be clear about.
A true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is something different that exists within teams that work together on computers.
This "invisible team" is a 'management team' to which each member of the team reports. This 'invisible team' sets the standards for each member to follow.
Why would an organization want to engage in work that typically takes a lot of time? This work involves developing an organization capable of learning. One of the main reasons for promoting organizational learning within an organization is the practice of innovation.
When the departments of an organization utilize all resources well, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Because of this, the process of an organization working together to overcome a challenge can develop into new and different kinds of processes to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can have new and different ways of doing things, leaders must establish a culture of creating new and different things, and there must also be a practice of sharing knowledge and learning together.
Angel (2006) clearly discusses the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological information provides evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition, thus making the area of research more focused and exact.
The relationship between 'brain pathology' and behavior supports scientists in their research.
They have known for a long time that various types of damage to the brain, such as trauma, lesions, and tumors, can cause changes in behavior and thinking.
This new technology that has emerged is helping us to see and investigate the structures and processes of the brain that we have not seen before.
This provides us with new information and materials to develop simulation models that can help us clearly understand the processes that occur within our minds.
Don't think of AI as only related to 'science fiction', AI has become an important area within 'computer science', capable of functions related to behavior, learning, and making changes within a machine.
The research within AI involves developing machines to perform tasks that typically require human expertise to make decisions.
Example: it controls things, plans and schedules time for things, knows how to answer customer questions, and recognizes handwriting, voice, and face.
This kind of things have their own areas of study, and they look at ways to provide answers to the problems that arise every day.
Now they are using this AI system within the areas of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and they have used it to build some computers for homes and video game software applications.
Field trips are an important part of classrooms. Often, teachers want to take their students to places where they cannot just hop on a bus and go.
Technology provides answers with a 'field trip' that happens on the computer. Students can view 'museum artifacts', see an 'aquarium', and admire beautiful 'art' while sitting inside the classroom.
The practice of sharing a 'field trip' on the computer is also a good way to reflect on a journey and share experiences with previous classes.
For example, each year students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website for their trip to the State Capital, and each year this website gets a new style, but the old versions remain online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can help students write well. Many times, students start their blogs with grammar and spelling that are not good, and when there is an audience, they will change and write better.
Because students are known to talk a lot when something isn't right, this student who writes the blog will start writing properly to avoid comments that say they write poorly.
And also, blogging "tends to encourage students to learn more about what is happening in the communities they are part of." This need to meet the needs of their blog readers makes students more knowledgeable and become interesting (Toto, 2004).
'Blogging' is a tool that helps people work together, and it reinforces what they learn to extend beyond what they can learn in a single day inside school.
Use blogs in a good and proper way "so that students can evaluate things and know what is incorrect and what is correct; when working with materials on the Internet, students can know their level when they evaluate what others have written and also they can provide their opinions on emerging issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the capital of Canada where people use two languages, and it has art galleries and museums that show the past and present time in Canada.
Far to the south is Niagara Falls and to the north is Muskoka, a nice place with many other locations.
People outside say that all these things and more show that Ontario is a place that truly reflects the colors of Canada.
Large areas in the far north have few people, and some places are uninhabited.
One thing to consider within the population that surprises many is: There are more African Americans living in the US than the total number of citizens in Canada.
Eastern African Islanders are those who live in the Indian Ocean outside the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is truly very large, and it is somewhat like its own continent when we look at it from the perspective of wildlife.
Many of the small islands are independent countries, or they remain as part of France, and they serve as luxury beach resorts.
Also, the Arabs brought Islam to these places, and it became a major religion in Comoros and Mayotte.
The attitude and mindset of the people in Europe and 'colonialism' began in the '15th century', when the explorer from Portugal, Vasco de Gama, discovered the Cape Route during his journey from Europe to India.
In the northern part of the region, it is surrounded by the Sahel, and in the west and southwest, it is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is good that women who go to that place must say they are married, even if they are not truly married.
He is good at wearing a ring (not to wear a ring that looks expensive).
Women must recognize that behaviors from different cultures can lead to what they perceive as harassment, and often people can follow you, hold your hand, and so on.
You must be strong and say no to people, do not be afraid to stand firm and speak (this behavior is normal in this place, it is not right for them to do that!).
The city of Casablanca today was founded by the Berber people who settled there in the 10th century BCE, and it was used as an important port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenid, who called it Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and built it again under the name Casa Branca, but they abandoned the place after an earthquake occurred in 1755.
The 'sultans' of Morocco rebuilt this city as Daru l-Badya and Spanish traders called it Casablanca when they established their centers there.
Inside all parts of Casablanca, it is one of the places where there is no good place to buy things.
In old Medina, it's easy to find places that sell Moroccan items like 'tagine', 'pottery', 'leather goods', 'hookahs', and various 'geegaws', but all these things are for tourists to buy.
Goma is a city that tourists like to visit in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the eastern part near the country of Rwanda.
In the year 2002, the volcanic eruption from Nyiragongo destroyed Goma and covered many of the roads in the city, significantly affecting the center of the town.
Even though Goma is relatively safe, tourists who go to see places outside of Goma must find out and understand well the kind of conflict happening in North Kivu province.
This city is the place to stay and claim Mount Nyiragongo with the people who search for Mountain Gorillas. The price for these gorilla tracking groups is better than others inside Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorbike taxi) to get around inside Goma. The local price for this is about 500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Another thing is that "Timbuktu" is difficult to reach and they use this name as a metaphor for something different, located in a distant place.
Today, Timbuktu is a town that does not have much, although it has a good reputation that attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was placed on the list of 'world heritage sites' in danger because of damage occurring to its surrounding desert areas.
It was a place where PBS program by Henry Louis Gates' Wonders of the African World made an important stop and examined it.
This city is different from all other cities in the country, because it looks more like an Arab place and not like an African place.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east part of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
This park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 ecozones, each supporting different kinds of wildlife.
It is one of the big attractions that draws tourists to South Africa and is considered an important feature within the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Just like all South African National Parks, there is a 'conservation' and 'entry fee' for each day in the parks.
He/she is good at buying a Wild Card, which provides access to enter all parks within South Africa or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong, and it is a place where many tourists go.
The buildings that cover the sky of Hong Kong are said to resemble a 'bar chart' that shines, and this shine is reflected by the waters of Victoria.
To see the best parts of Hong Kong, leave the island and go across the water to the Kowloon side.
The major development numbers on Hong Kong Island are concentrated and located on the reclaimed land along the northern coastline.
This is the place that the British colonizers took as their own, so if you want to see signs of the colonizers from the past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest littoral mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) into Bangladesh and extending deep into India's mainland far from the coast.
They declared that the Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This part of the jungle is located within the territory of India, known as Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not only mangroves and coastal areas — they include some of the last large forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
