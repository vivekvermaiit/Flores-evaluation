USA Gymnastics supports the letter to the United States Olympic Commission and recognizes the absolute need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the statement of the United States Olympic Committee that the interests of our athletes, their teams, and the sports themselves will be better protected if we support meaningful changes within our organization, rather than if the organization loses its official powers.

This fact not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers (a theory already widespread), but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as about color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the feathers of this animal were chestnut-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the issue of feather development in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but have other features—barbs and hooks—researchers concluded that the rachis likely evolved later than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Scientists assume that even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not those of a juvenile.
Scientists assume that even though it is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample represents the plumage of an adult animal and not the down feathers of a juvenile.
A bomb in a car that exploded near the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than 20 other people.

They found that the Sun operates on the same basic principle as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system is apparently determined by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.
Based on luminosity and rotation, the Rossby number of a star is determined, which is related to the flow of plasma.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic turnover.

The work was mostly theoretical, but a program was written to simulate the observation of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team searched for a phenomenon that would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a force on the Earth and causes the tides in the sea level, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory says that most of the dark matter in the galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of "halo" and is composed of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered tuberculosis (XDR-TB) extremely resistant to drugs in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In the interview, he stated that the new variant is "highly concerning, even alarming, due to its high malignancy."
Dr. Moll thinks that some patients might have caught this virus in the hospital, and at least two of them were hospital healthcare workers.
Over the course of one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis still seems low; 6,000 people out of a total of 330,000 infected at any given moment in South Africa.

A doctor who worked at the Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh is to be tried for aggravated murder, according to Ohio authorities, after his mother was found dead in the trunk of her car on Wednesday.
A 29-year-old Dr. Malar Balasubramanian was found in Blue Ash, Ohio, a suburb about 15 miles north of Cincinnati. He was lying by the road in a T-shirt and underwear, apparently under the influence of strong medication.
She led the police officers to her black Oldsmobile Intrigue vehicle, which was located about 150 meters away.
There they found the body of the fifty-three-year-old Saroja Balasubramanian covered with blood-stained blankets.
The police said the body looked like it had been there for about a day.
The first cases of the disease appeared at the end of July this season.
This disease is transmitted in pigs and reaches humans through mosquitoes.
The outbreak prompted the Indian government to adopt measures such as deploying pig hunters in seriously affected areas, distributing thousands of mosquito nets, and spraying pesticides.
The government also promised several million doses of the vaccine against encephalitis, which will help prepare health agencies for the next year.
Vaccination plans intended for delivery to historically most vulnerable areas for this year have been postponed due to a lack of resources and low prioritization compared to other diseases.

In infrared photos, you can see how the temperature differences between day and night indicate that these are likely caves.
"During the day, they are cooler than the surrounding surface, and at night, they are warmer."
"Their thermal changes are not as stable as in the case of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but this is consistent with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing from the astrogeological team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff.
In France, voting traditionally takes place without modern technology: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed sheet of paper into an envelope, indicating the candidate they have chosen.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law contains a rather strict codification of the election process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that there were no envelopes in them before the voting began and that no other envelopes were added except those submitted by counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives, who then witness the entire process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

Four female skiers in the women's group practicing sit-skiing did not finish their runs, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to place in the competition.
The police in Madhya Pradesh have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Police Director D.K. Arya said, "We have detained five individuals who raped a woman from Switzerland, and we secured a mobile phone and a laptop belonging to the victim from the detainees."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house at the moment of the car crash, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered a serious head injury.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while rescue services extricated the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was then charged with the murder of her son by the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
He is awaiting charges and a trial in custody, but witness evidence may be compromised because her image was widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice operates differently, and the courts perceived the publication of photographs as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be skating on thin ice if they publish photographs, etc., of suspects."
The prosecution, which is in charge of the criminal proceedings, has made it clear to journalists that no further information will be provided at least until an indictment is issued.
According to the leak, the document will concern border disputes in which Palestine wants to maintain the borders as they were before the Middle East war in 1967.
Other included topics apparently involve the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, as well as the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years following the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a military presence for only five years.
The marksmen were under strict supervision by rangers during the supplementary pest protection study, as the study was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In collaboration with NPSW and NSW Inc (the Australian Sporting Shooters Association), qualified volunteers were hired under the auspices of the association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director in the area of natural heritage conservation at the NPWS agency, the four shooters selected for the first shooting received comprehensive safety training.
Martelly yesterday swore in the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEO as part of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission represented Martelly's response to the massive anti-government protests that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were sparked by the failure to organize elections, and some have been ongoing since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of defective iPods were reported, which caused a total of six fires and resulted in four people sustaining minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple informed it about 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay of the report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 local time (Friday 20:19 GMT).
The Office of Emergency Management of the Northern Mariana Islands reported that no damages were reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no signs of a tsunami.
Former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued and at least six dead have been confirmed at this time.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were soon released, as were the Filipino photographers.
Photographers later replaced the older lady because she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He was trained as an obstetrician and in 1959 he began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While Liggins worked in the hospital, he began to study premature births in his free time.
His research showed that if the hormone is administered, it accelerates the maturation of the fetal lungs.
The Xinhua agency reported that government investigators discovered two "black boxes" with flight data records on Wednesday.
Colleague wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died during the night when there were two moons in the sky. Unique, just like herself. She was a strong woman.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels stated, "Luna was as crazy as I am... maybe even more... I liked her and I will miss her... hopefully she's somewhere better."
An opinion poll conducted with 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election showed that the number of people who disagree with transforming Australia into a republic increased by 8 percent compared to 2008.
Chair of the caretaker government, Julia Gillard, stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of survey participants share this opinion and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Regarding extreme opinions within the survey, 29 percent of respondents are convinced that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but there were doubts about his eligibility due to his objections.
He could not take the medication needed to overcome the pain, as drugs are banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number so far on January 25.
The discovery was verified by several people at the beginning of February using various hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be a source of water delivery to Earth along with organic matter, which can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, particularly how Earth formed from the time when comets collided with Earth long ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo started as governor at the beginning of the year and last month signed a law legalizing same-sex marriages.
He dismissed these rumors as "political gossip and recklessness."
There are speculations that he will attempt a presidential candidacy in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow planes to fly shorter routes and thus save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
Compared to ground radar-based technology, it uses satellite technology that allows air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater accuracy and provides pilots with more precise information.
There will be no special transportation services, the overground train will not stop at Wembley, and there are no parking facilities or park-and-ride locations available on site.
Concerns about the lack of transportation options have increased the chances that the match will have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science describes the emergence of new bird species on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden stated that new species evolved in just two generations, even though it was assumed that this process takes much longer, due to breeding between endemic finches, medium-sized Darwin's finches, and immigrant cactus and ground finches.
Gold can be shaped into all sorts of forms. It can be rolled into miniature pieces.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be bent and twisted. It can be hammered or pressed into sheets.
It can be processed to a significant thinness and attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was often used to embellish hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator yourself using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on whether the chemical is acidic or alkaline.
The pH value is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (the letter H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix both dry powders together and then form a ball out of them with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, resulting in a peculiar sensation and forming a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in nearly every house, connected to a sophisticated waste system.
Remains of wastewater drainage systems were found in Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In ancient Rome, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, which were visited by both men and women together.
If you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite for the call.
The satellite in space receives a call and then bounces its signal almost immediately back down.
The satellite was launched into space using a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and the field of view.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a large rocket measuring over 100 feet is required.
The bicycle changed the world in an unprecedented way. The most significant impact it had was greatly facilitating and accelerating transportation.
The train, the car, and other means of transport brought us.
Under them are medium-sized felines, whose food consists of medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including feral domestic cats), whose diet mainly consists of small prey such as insects, rodents, reptiles, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the system of ecological niches, meaning that each cat has its own tasks that do not allow it to compete with the others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
The pack consists of one to three related adult males along with up to thirty females and young.
Females are usually closely related and form a large family consisting of sisters and daughters.
A lion pride behaves similarly to a pack of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A tiger can climb (although not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (genus panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion but rather like a series of sharp, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they have the opportunity, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by smell, detecting where they moved along the ground by sniffing.
At night, they see very well thanks to their night vision and can move very quietly. Ocelots hunt by blending into their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originate (for example, when they cross a mountain ridge or a river, or move to a new island from which it is not easy to return), they often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or ways of adaptation to become a stronger competitor than in the past.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, they begin to look less and less like the other populations.
Eventually, in several thousand or even millions of years, these two populations will be so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Plants produce nourishment from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is of plant origin. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it had no worries except for other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were covered with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set embedded in the upper palate, meaning nothing that crossed its path had a chance to escape.
We do not know for sure, but they might have had a forked tongue. Their diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and they might have even been cannibals.
They also attacked anything that entered the water. Even a large dinosaur like T. rex was no match for them.
While most of their meals would not be unfamiliar to us, the Romans had their share of unusual or peculiar banquet compositions, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that women and poor people ate their food sitting on chairs, while wealthy men liked to hold feasts together and reclined on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia only in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be their home.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through rituals and celebrations.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine dedicated to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were merely open counters facing the street. Stone was used for building houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no extensive forests, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas state that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it the Green Land.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Despite all the countries being part of "Scandinavia", there were many differences among the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, there are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text is on the bottom of the document, written upside down.
Even though the author is not known for certain, it is evident that the large parchment document (dimensions 29¾ x 24½ inches) was rolled up and stored shortly after its creation.
It is therefore likely that the entry was added simply as an appendage.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles brought the liberation of northern France, but the south of the country had not yet been liberated.
It was ruled by the French "Vichy." These were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invading forces instead of fighting.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched an invasion of southern France. The invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a certain culture, common to a significant large group of people, who live and work in mutual cooperation, i.e., together they form a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis," which means "civil" and is related to the Latin "civis," meaning "citizen," and also "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and at the same time it somehow defines the size of the society.
The predecessors of nations were city-states. The culture of civilization is characterized by the transmission of knowledge over several generations, the presence of long-lasting cultural traces, and adequate dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government, with Congress as its only component, under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities to enforce laws, which often did not cooperate.
It also had no authority to annul tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous consent of all states, and only then could they be supplemented. The states took the central government lightly, to the extent that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, and in 2006, Italy won the FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, inline hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are very popular in northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands, and the largest of them is Honshu, so Japan is actually the 7th largest island in the world!
Considering the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, it is sometimes referred to as an "archipelago" in a geographical sense.
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century when passing European sailors recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating the transformation of indigenous grain production practices by employing Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) took control over the southwestern and northern coasts of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it transferred sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan. Japan ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main parts: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what the buildings originally looked like.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photo format in the world is 35mm, which was the most frequent film size at the height of the analog film era.
They are still being produced today, but more importantly, their aspect ratio has been adopted by the sensor formats of digital cameras.
Although it is somewhat confusing, the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio in whole numbers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are equal to or closely approximate this aspect ratio.
The often abused and ridiculed "rule of thirds" is a simple guideline that creates dynamics in an image while maintaining a certain order.
According to this specification, the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the frame vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had gained wealth and power, became the target of detailed scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion united European states despite differences in language and customs.
His ubiquitous power had an impact on everyone, from the king to the common citizen.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary resources are there precisely for this purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for more than 1,000 years. This concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was fulfilled.
Soon after the outbreak of the conflicts, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective because it disrupted vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements from the previous two centuries.
Britain patrolled international waters to ensure that no ships entered entire areas of the ocean, which posed a danger even to neutral vessels.
Since this tactic met with only a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine military forces.
During the twenties, attitudes of pacifism and isolationism prevailed among most citizens and nations.
As witnesses of the horror and cruelty during the First World War, nations longed to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation for Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his superior from his previous job).
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing different time periods; each era of China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable period of divided provinces. The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms Period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a ruthless war was fought among many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, when thousands of people died in the battle for the throne in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, or the belief that the country belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
After the revolution, professions were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful ones to succeed.
The same applies to the army, as now it depends on abilities instead of class-based military ranks.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed workers from other countries to try to start a revolution in their own countries.
Mohamed was deeply interested in matters beyond the realm of secular life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain called "Noor" (light) and contemplated there.
The cave itself, which has survived a significant period, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual focus.
Given its location at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it is not easy to find her at all, even if it were known that she exists. Inside the cave, she is in complete isolation.
There is nothing to see but the wonderfully clear sky and a great number of surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, very little of this world can be seen and heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid, which the Egyptians built in the 3rd century BC, is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures constructed in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the "Giza Necropolis," in Egypt's Valley of the Kings includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created as a tribute to Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The "up-bow" sign looks like the letter V and the "down-bow" looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom side.
Above means you start at the tip and push the bow, below means you start at the frog (where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Movement upwards generally produces a softer sound, while movement downwards is stronger and more penetrating.
In the sheet, you can write your own marks with a pencil, but keep in mind that printed marks have their reason from a musical perspective, so they should usually be followed.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister Élisabeth of France were forced by a crowd of market women to return from Versailles to Paris.
They went back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a turbulent crowd shouting threats at the king and queen.
A crowd of people forced the king and queen to leave the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point in Versailles, a member of the criminal group waved the head of the royal guard in front of the horrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States, so that a large part of the expenses would be covered, with bond interest flowing in the name of the Philippine government through banking houses on Wall Street.
Additional surplus value extracted from the long-term exploitation of Filipinos would, of course, constitute the fundamental revenue of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the formation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, according to most opinions, ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas: for example, so-called technology push or technological imperative, or the belief that human destiny is governed by an all-pervasive logic along with scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that significantly transcends cultural or political influence, and that technology, on the other hand, has an "influence" on societies which is inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that when motor vehicles appear, it will inevitably lead to the development of roads.
However, the nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a mere handful of cars, so new manufacturing methods are being developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to an increase in road accident cases, which causes the invention of new techniques in healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism carried a significant element of cultural determinism drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geographically shaped individuals and over time, customs and culture related to this geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the society's place, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion center of the modern world, Constantinople was known as the fashion center of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began around the year 400 AD and lasted until approximately the year 1100 AD.
Its significance diminished during the twelfth century, particularly because crusaders brought back to Europe valuables like silk and spices, which had a higher value at home than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was during this time that the title of the fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th–11th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, the dresses were significantly influenced by Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication, Western styles lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advancements of this time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is farming conducted to produce only such an amount of food that meets the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system utilizing seeds native to a given ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively straightforward techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence farming, which still occurs in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differ in terms of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often express their membership through distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes clothing, behavior, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on several unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults while growing up due to neglect, unfortunate accidents, or intentional abuse.
Such children are called "feral" children. Some feral children were held captive for a long time (usually by their own parents), in some cases they lived in isolation because their parents rejected them due to their severe mental or physical disability.
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma, after which they were abandoned or ran away.
It is claimed of the others that they were raised by animals, while it is said of some that they lived in the wild alone.
When completely raised by non-human animals, a feral child exhibits behavior almost identical (within the limits of physical capacities) to that of the animal caregiver, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method goes one step further.
The skeleton is not a learning method, but rather a tool that provides support to individuals undergoing the acquisition of new practices, such as using a new computer program or launching a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is a small clip in Microsoft Office.
The software incorporates Virtual constructions designed to analyze, motivate, and explain procedures that might be too challenging for the student themselves.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to exploitation.
No child should ever grow up in an environment where it does not receive proper nutrition, care, and upbringing; however, such cases do exist.
We believe that the foster care system will be a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is supposed to provide for all the needs that were not met in the household from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the internet add another dimension when it comes to use and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are proposed as important motivational elements for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continued interest" were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when they examined audience responses to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions – facial movements lasting only a few microseconds.
Specifically, by correctly interpreting micro-expressions, you can find out if the other person is lying to you.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks suggested how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century showed that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the differences between the two sets in both directions within each generation.
For primates with a digestive system similar to humans, it is difficult to satisfy the need for amino acids from plant sources available in the open savanna.
If they fail to do so, it has serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant sources would be the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for us as primates to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also provides a high amount of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors addressed the protein problem similarly to how chimpanzees do today on the savanna.
Interruption of sleep is the process of intentionally waking from normal sleep and falling back asleep after a short period (10–60 minutes).
This can easily be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm that brings you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the opposite side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking a large amount of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before sleep, as it forces a person to get up and go to the toilet.
The level of a person's inner peace corresponds to the opposite of the level of tension in their body and spirit.
The less tension, the more good life force brings. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Enlightenment can be attained by anyone. The only things standing in the way of this goal are our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the Buddha's teachings, but it has been expanded with the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are essentially very simple. They are Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through the poses of this yoga, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The focal point of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was the common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. The clashes of systems, processes, and cultures led to the collapse of cooperation between the countries at the end of the war.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It lasted another 40 years, and proxy armies indeed fought on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, and the only hope lay in retreat and reorganization of forces along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were almost overnight disrupted when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after troops invaded the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for transport is by far the most efficient way to carry large numbers of people and cargo across the ocean.
The traditional task of the naval fleet was to ensure the state's ability to transport people and goods, but at the same time, the navy also had to prevent the enemy from transporting their own people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to stop this traffic, mainly using submarines.
If the Allies failed, then Germany would likely be able to conquer Britain, similar to the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were mostly kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures and were often watched by shepherds, many of whom were children or adolescents similar to the more well-known sheep shepherds. These methods of herding are still used today.
Horse-drawn railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although stagecoach roads mostly consisted of parallel planks, they allowed draft horses to achieve greater speed and carry heavier loads than on other contemporary roads, which were somewhat rougher.
Rail sleepers were introduced relatively early to keep the tracks in place, but it was gradually found that tracks are more efficient when they have a strip of iron on their surface.
It became a common phenomenon, but the iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of transportation was walking, with humans beginning to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessor Australopithecus generally did not walk upright.
Bipeds can be found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To some extent, to reduce future suffering, we can live more environmentally friendly, join the environmental movement, and even become activists.
In many cases, it is the same as symptomatic treatment. However, if we are not just looking for a temporary solution, we should find the cause of the problems and eliminate them.
It is evident that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and problems have increased as a result of overpopulation and mankind's extravagant lifestyle.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to the printing office of John Dunlap.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, which are currently called "Dunlap prints."
The document was publicly read for the first time by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his soldiers in New York on July 9. One of the copies reached London on August 10.
The oldest known surviving copies of the document are the so-called Dunlap broadsides, a total of 25 prints from Dunlap's printing house. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs has survived to this day. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, birds still have many features that resemble dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits – or in computer jargon, bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms like vomiting are too general for an immediate diagnosis.
The best indicator of poisoning may be the presence of an open container with medications or household products containing toxic chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions in case of that particular poison.
The term beetle is used by entomologists for this group of insects in a formal sense.
This term is derived from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both assassin bugs and bedbugs are cunning, adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
Across the United States, approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis are known, making it a leading neurological disease among adults in their younger and middle ages.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
The couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or in the interest of their child.
These couples can opt for a plan to adopt their child.
In the case of adoption, biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method is, in fact, a guide for most scientific research.
However, it is not experimentation in itself. An experiment is a test used to disprove one or more possible hypotheses, but asking questions and observing are also important for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all areas of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many recorded rhythms in physiology and behavior often fundamentally depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are not merely responses to external periodic stimuli have been documented in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue in a free-running cycle even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments in which they either labeled the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the germline cells have been affected.
Only mutations in the germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations occurring elsewhere may cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-oriented tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to admire the landscape, including wildlife and animals.
Examples of activities in this type of tourism: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the relevant ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people in cars leave small towns, head to work, and meanwhile are passed by others who are heading to the place they themselves just left.
In this dynamic shuttle service, everyone participates and supports a transport system based on private vehicles.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has derailed the biosphere from its stable state, which has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in life in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely encounter such a degree of complaint about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints and fail on a daily basis? Are the traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something deeper at play?
Traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave similarly within a certain range; therefore, traffic usually maintains a reasonable consistency and can be approximately represented mathematically.
For the purpose of better representing traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of transportation facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly allowed them to evade enemies more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
It gives them a greater choice of small spaces where they can hide from predators.
In today's world, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
A thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system, including the Sun (and even other stars), moves around the Earth.
That makes sense, because it doesn't seem to a person that the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon is the largest and the second longest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, in some places it is up to six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water flowing from the rivers of our planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main course of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Despite the construction of stone pyramids continuing until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids in Giza were never surpassed either in size or in the technical precision of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were more than a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City includes around 800 residents. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legal documents and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are of Roman Catholic faith.
People have known the basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because these elements are found in nature in their pure form and can be relatively easily mined even with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These elements were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances forming what we see.
Alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Remember that there are plenty of elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are classified as metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil became a good friend of many people after its invention.
Unfortunately, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and secondary uses due to the emergence of new writing methods.
People today write messages on computer screens, so they don't come into contact with a pencil sharpener at all.
One can only wonder what happens to a keyboard when something newer comes along.
A fission nuclear bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to keep a nucleus with many protons and neutrons together.
It's something like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Then, by the process of nuclear fission, some of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with slight or even no contact.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and around 100 km on the far side.
Under the seas, it is weaker, whereas under mountain ranges, it is stronger.
On the near side, there may be more lunar seas because the crust is thinner here. This made it easier for lava to reach the surface.
Content theories are focused on identifying what can appeal to people or is close to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they adopt throughout adolescence.
These theories deal with what motivates certain people to want what they do and what in their environment compels them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior can emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues – peers. At one end of the spectrum is the effort to remain "one of them."
This type of manager has trouble with making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person changes beyond recognition and feels the need to change everything the team does and do it their own way.
After all, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often results in disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often act as contact points for their own physical group.
They often have more independence than regular team members because their teams may meet across different time zones, which their local management might not understand.
A unique component of a virtual team is also the presence of the so-called "invisible team" (Larson – LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
"The 'Invisible Team' is a management team to which every member is subordinate. The Invisible Team sets standards for individual members."
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing the concepts of a learning organization is innovation.
If all available resources are effectively utilized across the functional components of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can manifest.
The result is that the process of collaborating organizations to overcome obstacles can lead to new innovative processes to serve customers' needs.
For an organization to be innovative, its management must create an innovative corporate culture, implement knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used by organizations to achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to studying cognition, thus narrowing and specifying this research area.
The scientists' research is supported by the interconnection between brain disease and behavior.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to observe and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
It provides us with a lot of information and material for creating simulation models that will help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although artificial intelligence has strong connotations with science fiction, it forms a very important area of computer science concerned with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in artificial intelligence involves creating machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent actions.
Examples include monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer inquiries, handwriting recognition, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become independent disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, and are integrated into numerous applications of home computers and video game software.
Excursions are an essential part of every subject. The teacher would often like to take her students to places where a bus ride is not an option.
The technology offers a solution in the form of virtual tours. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Virtual sharing of excursions is also a great way to think about the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina create a website every year about their trip to the state capital. They redesign the site each year, but the old versions remain online and serve as an album.
Even blogs can improve students' writing skills. Although their blogging is often initially marked by careless spelling, the influence of other readers usually changes that.
Because students are often the most critical readers, the blogger is trying to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to be aware of the world around them." The need to spark audience interest inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and motivates students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "will allow students to improve their analytical and critical skills; through active responses to internet materials, students can define their attitudes in the context of other texts and formulate their perspective on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming, bilingual capital city of Canada offering a range of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south lie the Niagara Falls, while to the north, the beauties of the Muskoka region and beyond are yet to be discovered.
All this and much more highlights that Ontario is considered by foreigners to be a typical part of Canada.
Large areas further to the north are relatively sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
Many people will be surprised by the following population fact: there are more African Americans living in the USA than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and in terms of wildlife, we can consider it a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or are affiliated with France and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these countries. It thrived in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route (Cape Route) from Europe to India.
In the north, the area is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers present themselves as married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also good to wear a ring (just be careful that it doesn't look too expensive).
Women should keep in mind that due to cultural differences, they may sometimes encounter harassment and that it is not uncommon for a man to follow a woman while walking, grab her hand, etc.
Be unwavering in rejecting men and do not be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences do not justify it!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, and after the earthquake in 1755, they abandoned it.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city into Daru l-Badya, and Spanish traders who established trading bases there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods are sold, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide range of trinkets, but all this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located on the eastern edge near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets and especially the city center.
Even though Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside the city should be well considered, taking into account the current state of fighting that continues in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and offers one of the cheapest gorilla trekking experiences in Africa.
For getting around Goma, you can use boda boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual price for a short ride is about 500 Congolese francs.
In combination with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" began to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Timbuktu is today an impoverished city, but due to its reputation, it is a tourist attraction. It also has its own airport.
In 1990, due to desert sand, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS television show Wonders of the African World, hosted by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is in sharp contrast to the rest of the cities in the country, as it feels more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of the Republic of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River is on its southern boundary.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Similar to all the National Parks in South Africa, here too it is necessary to pay an entry fee to the park and a contribution for nature conservation.
Purchasing a Wild Card, which allows entry either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks, can also be beneficial.
The city of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, which many tourists consider a major travel destination.
A parade of buildings that make up the cityscape of Hong Kong is likened to a shimmering bar chart reflecting in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best views of Hong Kong can be had if you leave the island and head to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
A large majority of the dense urban development on Hong Kong Island is located on reclaimed land along the northern coastline.
This is a place appropriated by British colonists, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest belt of coastal mangroves in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Part of the forest on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, these forests are not just mangrove swamps – they also include some of the last remaining sections of the mighty jungles that once covered the plains of the Ganges.
The Sundarbans area covers 3,850 km², of which approximately one-third is covered by water bodies or wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a nature reserve, and it is estimated that currently, 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 Indian deer can be found in the area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most of them, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Given that intercity buses are often full, we recommend purchasing a ticket several days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient means to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes, each 3.5 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but operations did not begin until March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani tribe was the most significant indigenous group inhabiting the area we now know as eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who subsisted on hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, originally called the "Great Province of the Indies," was born as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and groups of indigenous people.
The Spanish initiated a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The largest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can be seen here at other times of the year as well.
If you are interested in tournaments and where to get tickets for polo matches, check out the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to one British pound (GBP).
It is possible to exchange money at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West shop.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and in the city of Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, but you might succeed with British and American currency. Be sure to ask the owners in advance what payment method you can use.
It is nearly impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange it before leaving them.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer there occurs when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures above 30 °C are common here.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but with the wind and humidity, it feels colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons here: The amount of precipitation remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although most animals in the park are accustomed to people, they are still wild animals in the wilderness, and thus they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park regulations, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
Although they look peaceful, bison, deer, moose, bears, and nearly all large animals can attack.
Each year, many visitors are injured due to not maintaining the proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
Also keep in mind that bears and other wildlife are attracted to smells, so avoid carrying or cooking aromatic foods and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1750s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of the notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships except for one British cruiser were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans perished.
During the independence efforts organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the killing of the highest chairman named Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches given that Auckland is situated between two harbors. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in North Harbour County) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost sandy beaches with safe swimming opportunities, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are at Waitemata Harbour in the sought-after districts of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a wide selection of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One," which is not a very complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The second local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines you can have, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be a better choice.
Tap water here is safe to drink, but if you are concerned, bottled water is readily available.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A small black is "espresso," cappuccino is full of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive, but first-rate.
Throughout the year, many trips to the cliff are undertaken, and injuries resulting from any of these causes are rare.
Even so, heed the advice of authorities, follow the signage, and pay careful attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of the town of Seventeen Seventy. Occasionally, they can be found outside of this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
The saltwater crocodile does not actively live in the ocean; its primary refuge is the river estuary north of the city of Rockhampton.
Booking accommodation in advance gives the traveler the assurance that they will have a place to sleep at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it is usually possible to book other forms of accommodation like campsites through them.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to think or to obtain additional documents for the destination (e.g., a visa).
Any modifications or requests should be directed first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel address.
In the case of some festivals, the vast majority of visitors decide to camp on-site, and most participants consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be at the center of the action, you'll need to arrive as soon as possible to get a campsite close to the music production.
Remember that even if the music on the main stage may have ended, in other sections of the festival the music can continue late into the night.
Some festivals include special camps for families with young children.
If you travel across the northern Baltic Sea in the winter, check the location of your cabin, because sailing through ice causes unbearable noise in exposed areas.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos mostly try to ensure that guests spend as much time and money there as possible. There are usually no windows or clocks, and it's often hard to find the way out.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment offers to keep visitors in a good mood and within the casino premises.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages on the house. However, intoxication adversely affects judgment, so all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who is going to drive at a high altitude or in a mountain pass should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and therefore you cannot drive the same way as on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a very short time to make it impossible for you to drive.
Visibility can also be reduced by falling or blowing snow or by dew or ice on the vehicle's windows.
Ice and snow, on the other hand, are normal in many countries and traffic continues without major interruptions throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and for many tourists represents the highlight of the entire trip.
The term safari in the familiar sense refers to overland travel for the purpose of viewing magnificent African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles, and the standard equipment thus provides a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so you can observe them better using binoculars.
The tourist safari consists of a hike lasting from several hours to several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in various locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it was already the host in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodations for the year 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, this situation could be difficult for you.
Cancellation policies may vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based event cancellation policies did not apply to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 Japanese yen, with regular tickets priced at 7,000 Japanese yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for borrowing, even if they are not directly in the room.
If an iron is not available or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if it's available.
Take care not to overheat the fabric (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, even burning).
There are many ways to purify water, some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, in others, several minutes are necessary.
Filters have varying efficiency, and if you are concerned, you should buy water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they do not know in their home regions.
Difficult insects can cause food spoilage, skin irritation, or in worse cases allergic reactions, poison spreading, or transmission of infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person by force are generally not classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping represents an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and other fees in designated areas.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxation can sometimes save significant amounts, especially when purchasing products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco products.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the highway from Buffalo to Pittsburgh, as it often passes through isolated wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be cautious: steep angles, narrow lanes, and sharp turns prevail.
The maximum permitted speed here is significantly lower than in preceding and adjoining sections – usually 35–40 mph (56–64 km/h) – and its strict adherence is even more important.
Interestingly, however, mobile phone services work much better here than in many parts of the journey, such as in the Pennsylvania wilderness.
German desserts are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are rich and diverse, very similar to those of their southern neighbors in Austria.
Fruit pastries are common. Apples are used in pastries year-round, then cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds and hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular desserts are often especially suitable with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to taste some hearty sweets, try the pastries, which are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made from various herbs, spices, and either meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on how much liquid it contains.
In the Mediterranean regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly added to curry. In southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is usually used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that covers a wide range of regional cuisines from across the country.
However, if used without further specification, this term usually refers to the cuisine originating from the central and eastern parts of the island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available across the archipelago, consists of many simply flavored dishes dominated by the taste of peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups, which hang on both sides of the saddle, serve as support for the rider's feet.
They provide riders with greater stability but can be associated with safety issues due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from the horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup and the horse starts to run, the rider can be dragged along. A number of safety measures can be adopted to minimize this risk.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a fine sole, which is quite narrow.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English ones, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to fall from the saddle when a falling rider pulls on it.
Chochamó Valley – a favorite climbing destination of the Chilean Prime Minister known as the Yosemite of South America, where extensive granite walls and cliffs can be found.
The mountain peaks offer breathtaking views. Climbers from all parts of the world are constantly establishing new routes thanks to the endless potential of the local walls.
Winter downhill sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending snowy terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
" Skiing is a common travel activity with many enthusiasts sometimes known as 'ski bums,' who plan their entire vacations around skiing in a particular location."
The idea of skiing is very old. Cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century. The first recreational skiing club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Ski touring: This activity is also referred to as cross-country ski touring, ski hiking, or ski trips.
It is related to alpine skiing or mountaineering, although they are not part of this activity, with the latter being performed in steep terrain and requiring much sturdier skis and boots.
Imagine a ski trail as similar to a hiking trail.
Under favorable conditions, you can manage to cover slightly greater distances than on foot – but you will rarely move at the speed you would achieve on cross-country skis without a heavy backpack and on a groomed trail.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but with a number of independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean going through visa applications and passport control several times.
However, the Schengen Area functions in this regard similarly to a single country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen country separately, which saves you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured items are considered antiques. Some tax agencies define antiques as goods that are more than 100 years old.
This definition has geographical variations, where, for example, the age limit in North America may be lower than in Europe.
Handmade items can be classified as antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sámi, and the culture associated with the trade is also important for many other professions.
However, not all Sámi traditionally engaged in large-scale reindeer herding; they also made a living through fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern crafts. Tourism represents an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
Although the term "gypsy" is widely used especially among the non-Romani population, it is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Romani people.
If the country you are planning to visit becomes the subject of a travel advisory, it may affect your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
You may prefer to look at advice from other governments rather than your own, but they are primarily intended for their own citizens.
An example can be citizens of the USA, who may face different situations in the Middle East than Europeans or Arabs.
Advice is merely a brief summary of the political situation in the given country.
The presented opinions are often cursory, general, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Adverse weather is a general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Stormy weather can occur anywhere in the world, and it takes various forms that may depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy precipitation, and fires are forms and consequences of stormy weather, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, cloudbursts, and cyclones.
The regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of all possible adverse weather risks in their area, as it can affect all travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
Internet searches for the term "Hostile Environment Course" will likely find the address of a local company.
The course usually covers all the problems described here in much more detail, often in the form of practical exercises as well.
The course usually lasts 2–5 days and includes role-playing-based training, thorough first aid instruction, and sometimes also weapons handling.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but there are few publications about war zones.
Travelers who plan to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documents for their return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without specifying gender (X) or documents updated to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies.
Security checkpoint screenings became far more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people before surgery should not expect to pass through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are returning waves that break on the beach, often at the site of a reef, etc.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow concentrates in several deeper sections, and it is precisely here that a rapid current into deep water can form.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion from trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for somewhere where the current won't sweep you away again, or, depending on your abilities and whether you've been noticed, it might be better to wait for help.
The shock of returning occurs sooner than cultural shock (there is a smaller phase of initial enthusiasm), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapted to a new culture often have an especially challenging experience readjusting to their native culture.
Upon returning home from staying abroad, you are accustomed to a new culture and have already lost some habits from your home.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, because they knew that travelers in a new country have to adapt.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also needed by travelers who are returning home.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the show starts.
Usually, you constantly hear tourists and vendors here. The story of sounds and lights resembles a fairy tale book.
The Sphinx serves as a backdrop and storyteller of a long tale.
Different scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and the individual pyramids are gradually illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by multiple countries and have the most bases – in 2020 there were 16 active ones.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the mainland. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other notable islands include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the peninsula surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here merge into a plateau, and then reappear to form a 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided in half by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part or in the Sentinel Range lies the highest mountain range of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif with its 4,892 meters high peak, Mount Vinson.
In remote locations without mobile signal coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone because, to make calls, you need to be outdoors with no obstacles between you and the satellite.
This service is often used by shipping, including recreational vessels and expeditions that need remote data.
Your local phone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those who plan to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
It is especially popular among people who are finishing school. It allows them to take a year off before starting university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad after finishing high school can improve your chances of higher education in your home country.
Tuition will usually be charged for enrollment in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boat trips. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also includes thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
On archipelagos and lakes, it is not absolutely necessary to have a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Shipbuilding is a national pastime in Finland – there is one boat for every seven to eight people.
Similarly, it is in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise, it is entirely unique (e.g., in the Netherlands, this number is one in forty).
Baltic Sea cruises usually include a longer stay in Russian St. Petersburg.
This means that you can visit this historic city for several full days and return to the boat at night to stay overnight.
If you disembark only during cruise tours, you will not need a separate visa (effective since 2009).
Some tours in the brochure include German Berlin. As can be seen on the map above, Berlin is not located anywhere near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the tour price.
Traveling by plane can be frightening for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if it is their first flight or if they have had a traumatic experience.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal fears and aversions to other things that many people have.
Understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help some people overcome the fear of the unknown or the feeling that the situation is not under control.
Parcel delivery companies are well paid for the fast delivery of goods. Time is often a very important factor for business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes and with smaller companies, however, a problem has arisen.
If the items were sent by air freight, it could take several days on some routes for the items to go through unloading and customs inspection.
The only way to handle it faster is to send the item as checked baggage. However, airline regulations do not allow sending baggage without a passenger, and this is where you come in.
The most common way to fly in first or business class is to shell out a big wad of cash (even better is to get your company to do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: you can expect to pay up to four times the regular economy ticket price for business class and eleven times for first class!
Generally speaking, it makes no sense to look for discounts on flights from point A to point B in first or business class.
Airlines know well that there is a certain key group of passengers who are willing to pay extra for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and in comfort, and the prices reflect that.
The capital city of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been plagued by various ethnic conflicts.
This conflict led in 1994 to the creation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova were restored despite the failure in political negotiations.
The main religion of Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir, with a population of around 3.7 million, is the third-largest city in Turkey, the second-largest port after Istanbul, and a significant transportation hub.
What was once an ancient city, Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, glass buildings, and modern shopping centers are interwoven with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has the atmosphere of Mediterranean Europe rather than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and features an unusual octagonal church.
On the cemetery, you can see interesting marble statues of doves above some tombs.
A half-hour walk through this interesting village is worth it.
In the north and within good reach is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners for its beauty described by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb network bus number 403 goes to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, also visit the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, which is a globally known site of apparitions of the Virgin Mary.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave site and also a place that holds nearly immeasurable significance for a substantial portion of the world's population.
Many men and women who survived internment at this place are still alive, and even more whose loved ones were murdered here or died from exhaustion due to forced labor, Jews or non-Jews alike.
In this place, please conduct yourself with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the place with marks or by scratching graffiti into structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Roughly half of the population prefers Catalan, a significant majority understand it, and practically everyone can speak Spanish.
Most signs and notices, however, are only in Catalan, as it is legally established as the first official language.
However, Spanish is commonly used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unscheduled service interruptions are announced by an automatic system in many different languages – in Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being selfish, rude, and arrogant people.
Although it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with others in Paris is to behave as well as possible, that is, to act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). It will significantly ease all your movements.
The initial impression that Parisians are somewhat abrupt quickly fades if you show at least basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, particularly with beech, spruce, or fir, and offers a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to the diverse microclimate, varied soil, and different altitudes, significantly different plant communities grow there.
The area is also home to a very wide range of animal and bird species.
Besides many more common species, rare fauna such as the brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie can be found here.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts covering the knees and to have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide shawls to women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own shawl, especially a colorful one, you will earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers covering the knees.
Even these can be borrowed from the supply at the entrance, but this clothing is not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. For men, they only have one size!
Mallorcan cuisine, like the cuisine of similar Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and often uses olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in the summer, is called Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available ingredients such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns along with the word Sie (you) are always written with a capital letter at the beginning, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It probably also makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated due to the need to determine whether the verb or adjective is used in a nominalized form.
In Italian, pronunciation is relatively simple because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to be careful with are C and G, as their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel that follows them.
Also, be aware of the different pronunciation of the sounds r and rr: "caro" means "dear," while "carro" means "car."
Persian has relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
If you read these grammar basics, you will learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand individual phrases.
It goes without saying that if you know any of the Romance languages, learning Portuguese will be easier for you.
However, people who know a little Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is so similar that it does not need to be studied separately.
Premodern observatories are mostly obsolete today and serve as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution at their peak was not as much of an issue as it is today, they are usually located in cities or campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Observing cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept comes from China, where plum blossoms were a popular flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebrations were held by the emperor solely for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural habitat, so resist the temptation to take even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally arranged garden, you will be thrown out without discussion for collecting "specimens."
Singapore is generally an extremely safe country to stay in. It's also very easy to navigate there, and you can purchase almost anything upon arrival.
"However, given that it is located in the 'true tropics' just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to contend with the heat (always) and the intense sun (when the sky is clear, less often)."
Some buses also travel north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check if the bus you intend to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be an interesting place to go on vacation.
For example, visiting castles in the valleys of the Loire and Rhine or taking a scenic tour through interesting cities on the Danube or cruising along the Erie Canal.
They also determine the routes of popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most significant holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition where people stay awake on Easter night at an exposed place to see the sunrise.
Naturally, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could just as well be pre-Christian festivals of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold Easter vigils on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, when the congregation often bursts into celebration at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands swam there, flew there, or were carried there by the wind or ocean currents.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were not able to cover this distance, and the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal in the Galápagos.
Since the arrival of humans on the Galapagos, a number of mammals have been brought in, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will be able to experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It offers a suitable opportunity to observe the aurora Borealis, as the sky will be dark more or less the whole time.
Because these areas are only sparsely populated and light pollution is mostly not a problem, you will be able to enjoy the view of the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are accustomed to.
The standard attire for a businessman is a suit, and colleagues address each other by their surnames or position titles.
Harmony in the workplace is key; rather than praising individual accomplishments, group effort is emphasized.
Employees must obtain approval from their supervisors for each of their decisions and are expected to follow their supervisors' instructions without question.
