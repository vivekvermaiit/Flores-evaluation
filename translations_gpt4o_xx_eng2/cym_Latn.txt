In late 2017, Siminoff appeared on the shopping TV channel QVC.
Ring settled a legal case with a security company that was also a competitor, namely ADT Corporation.
Although it appears that one experimental vaccine can reduce Ebola deaths, so far, it has not been clearly shown that any drugs are suitable for treating the current infection.
One antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but formal studies suggested it had less benefit than sought in terms of preventing death.
In the PALM trial, Zmapp served as a control, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline and compared the three other treatments against it.
United States Gymnastics supports the letter of the United States Olympic Committee and acknowledges the absolute need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by moving forward with meaningful change within our organization, rather than by decertification.
USA Gymnastics is assisting an independent investigation that could shed light on how abuse of the degree so bravely described by Larry Nassar's survivors could have gone undetected for so long, and welcomes any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same aim - to make gymnastics, and other sports, as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a safe, positive environment that empowers them.

In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already in circulation, it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal are chestnut-brown on the upper side with a pale or carrot-like color on the underside.
The discovery provides insight into the evolution of bird feathers too.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have well-developed shafts, called rachis, but have other feather features - barbules and barbs - the researchers concluded that the rachis is likely to be a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flying but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows adult feathers and not downy chick feathers.
The researchers suggested that, although this was a young dinosaur tail, the sample showed adult feathers and not chick down.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two policemen and injuring more than twenty other people.

They discovered that the Sun operates on the same fundamental principles as other stars: It was found that the activity of every star in the system is driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the stellar Rossby number, which relates to the flow of plasma.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work done was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius stream.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon pulls on the earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that the dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as regular matter does.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter around the galaxy is located around the galaxy like some kind of halo, and it consists of a number of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said that the new variant is "very worrying and very frightening because of the very high death rate".
Some patients may have contracted the infection in the hospital, according to Dr. Moll, and at least two were hospital health workers.
In a year's time, an infected individual can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, it appears that the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis remains low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people are infected at any given time in South Africa.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed sheet of paper showing their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting register.
French electoral law reorganizes cases quite strictly.
Since 1998, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes present at the start of the vote except for those of the authorized voters that have been properly counted.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under heavy supervision, following specific procedures.

She saw her other race, the Giant Slalom, where she finished tenth in the women's sitting group race with a combined run time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the person who finished in first place, Claudia Loesch from Austria, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the one who finished ninth, Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four female skiers in the sitting group failed to finish their runs, and a total of 45 out of 117 skiers failed to be listed in the Giant Slalom.
Madhya Pradesh police found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and have recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of those accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed as emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then accused of murdering her son.
She is in custody until there is a charge and case, but any eyewitness evidence could be compromised because her image has been published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK but justice in Scotland works differently and courts have viewed the publication of photos as something that could be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes "journalists walk a dangerous line if they publish photos etc. of those under suspicion."
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, has suggested to journalists that no further comments will be given until at least the end of the day.
According to the secret leaker, the document will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the pre-1967 Middle East War borders.
Among other subjects reportedly addressed are the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel insists on a continued military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to allow such a presence for only five years.
The archers in the additional trial on pest control would be closely supervised by rangers, as the trial is being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters' Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Interim Director of Conservation and Heritage of the Park with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting campaign received safety instructions and comprehensive training.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEO as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the government that began in October.
The protests, which were sometimes violent, were triggered by a failure to hold elections, which were supposed to have been held since 2011.
There have been around 60 cases of defective iPods overheating reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) said it had been aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 24 additional cases of overheating, with the company describing them as "non-serious".
The ministry responded by calling the delay of the report by Apple "truly unfortunate".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said no damage had been reported in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle towards the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, were released early, along with the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers replaced an elderly woman because she needed the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and went into a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While he was working in the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm birth during his spare time.
His research showed that if the hormone was given, it would accelerate the maturation of the baby's lungs in the womb.
Xinhua reported that government researchers discovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on a night with two moons. Quite unique just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels made the comment that "Luna is as strange as I am... maybe more so... I love her and will miss her... I hope she is in a better place".
Out of 1,400 people who were polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposing Australia becoming a republic grew by 8 percent since 2008.
The Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view, eager for Queen Elizabeth II to be the last queen of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of those surveyed believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 230m freestyle and in three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to their problems there is doubt about their fitness.
He has not been able to take the drugs he needs to overcome his pain because they are banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several individuals verified the discovery using hardware and software by the beginning of February, and it was published on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets were the source of the water supply to the earth along with organic substances that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his job as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense".
It is guessed that he will run for the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology rather than older ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide more detailed information to pilots.
No additional transport is arranged and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and neither car parking nor park and ride facilities are available at the stadium.
Fears about the lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would be forced to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species had evolved in only two generations, although this process was believed to have taken much longer, due to breeding between the endemic Darwin’s finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and adhered to another metal. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The juice of the cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons with their electrons removed (since Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Whisk the two dry powders together and then, with clean wet hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to a complex sewage system.
Traces of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
It takes a huge rocket over 100 feet tall to put a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to provide much easier and faster transportation.
He has brought us the train, the car, and many other transportation devices.
Underneath them are cats of a more moderate size that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming pet cats) that prey on much more numerous small prey like insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to its success is the niche concept, a special role for each cat that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three related mature male lions, along with up to thirty females and cubs.
The women are usually closely related to each other, as a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave very much like packs of wolves or dogs (but not like other big cats), and are also very deadly to their prey.
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (although not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the force of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same genus (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of vehement words being shouted.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists think that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) by smelling, detecting where they've been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and move very stealthily, too. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population it came from (as if moving over a range of mountains or a river, or if it moved to a new island so that it is not easy to move back) it often finds itself in an environment different from the one it was in before.
The new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they start to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, breathe out).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Plants are most of the foods we eat. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other Mosasauruses.
Its long mouth was full of more than 70 very sharp teeth, along with an additional set in the roof of its mouth, meaning that there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We do not know for certain, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it might even have been a cannibal.
It would also attack anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex would not be its equal.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feast items, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of dormouse called a glirid.
Another difference was that while the poor people and women ate their food sitting in chairs, the wealthy men liked to have feasts together by reclining on their sides as they ate their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no grain, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods which was considered to be the home of that god.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods and the priests would try to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open temple court and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not as important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
The girls were cooking in the yard; the shops with open counters were looking out over the street. Stones were used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the lands of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas, they say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living in that place at the time.
Although each country is "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have watched the film National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although nobody knows for certain who wrote it, it is known early in its life that the large parchment document (it measured 29 and three quarter inches by 24 and a half inches) was rolled for storage.
So, it is likely that the notation has been added as a label only.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles had freed northern France, but the south was still not free.
They were governed by "Vichy" France. These were the French who had agreed to peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers rather than fight them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies attacked southern France, the attack was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just a fortnight, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a large significant group of people who live together and cooperate as a society.
The word "civilisation" comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and that somehow defines the scope of society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. Civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge across multiple generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and fair dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—with Congress as its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it depended on provincial authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
He also had no authority to trample on tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be amended and the states were so disdainful of the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, as well as the Germany national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and they were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster, a group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago".
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century where passing European sailors recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, initiating a transformation in grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal areas of western and northern Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which controls the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, which are Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, and this was the primary film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
36mm in width and 24mm in height is the actual 35mm format, which is slightly confusing.
So it is said that the aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or roughly correspond to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often misused and mocked, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had bound the countries of Europe together despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to relieve suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this accumulation of power and money led many to question whether this belief was being fulfilled.
Soon after the war started, Britain initiated a blockade against the German navy.
The strategy proved effective, disrupting essential military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law restructured by several international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
Given that the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to their unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the predominant attitudes of the majority of citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of indicating different periods; each period of China or every ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
There was also an unstable age of divided states between all the royal lineages. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce warfare occurred between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China; thousands of people died fighting to sit in the top seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social effects such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Occupations were also open to all male candidates after the Revolution, enabling the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true of soldiers because rather than the ranks of the army being based on class they were now based on the quality of the gun.
The French Revolution also inspired many other working-class people who were oppressed in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad had a great interest in matters beyond this mundane life. He used to go to a cave which became known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) for meditation.
The cave itself, which survived the ages, provides a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
Lying on the summit of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it is not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. Once you are inside the cave, it is complete isolation.
There is nothing to see except the beautiful clear sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramid structures constructed to honor deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains a number of pyramids (the great pyramid is the largest), a number of smaller tombs, a number of temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upward bow mark" looks like a V and the "downward bow mark" looks like a staple or a square with its bottom side missing.
Up means you should start at the front and push the bow, and down means you should start at the handle (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A bow up usually creates a softer sound, while a bow down is stronger and more decisive.
You are welcome to mark your scores in pencil, but remember that the bow markings are there for a musical reason, so they should be treated with respect as a rule.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two young children (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged 4), along with the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forcibly taken back to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women on the 6th of October 1789.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to have their carriage windows open all the way.
At one time, a member of the swarm waved the head of a royal guard who had been killed in front of the Queen who was terrified for her life.
The cost of the United States' imperial war expenditure in the conquest of the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S. to cover a large amount of the expenses and interest on bonds that were being raised in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the special profit derived from exploiting Filipino people would be equivalent to the fundamental gains of U.S. imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, you must understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
This era, where the events took place, is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the eleventh century, the twelfth century, and the thirteenth century (AD 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which traditionally end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that covers a wide range of ideas in practice, from pushing technology or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by fundamental logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
The majority of interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the motor car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, the road network across the country is not economically viable for a handful of cars alone, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged bodies.
There was a large element of cultural determination in romanticism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time practices and culture arose that belonged to that geography, and these, existing in harmony with the place of society, were better than laws imposed oppressively.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His fame for being a centre of luxury began around 400 A.D. and continued until around 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that Crusaders returned bringing gifts like silks and spices that were worth more than what Byzantine markets offered.
This is when the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its height between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
At the beginning, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, as a result of slow communication channels, fashions in the west could be behind by as much as 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the age as a result of the crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that is done to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family only.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, that uses native seeds preserved for the ecoregion along with crop rotation or other fairly simple techniques to ensure the maximum possible yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still true in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together individuals of the same nature who feel neglected by social standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be unique due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that define a subculture as unique can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often demonstrate their membership through a unique and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, practices, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, socialized by adults as they grew up.
Such children are called "semi-wild" or wild. Some semi-wild children have been captured by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the children were abandoned because the parents rejected the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may have experienced abuse or severe trauma as children before being abandoned or running away.
It is claimed that others have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When a child is raised entirely by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely like that of the specific animal caring for them, such as their fear of or indifference to human beings.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step beyond that.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but rather a support that aids individuals experiencing new learning situations such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of scaffold but so is the little paperclip guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are embedded in the software and are intended to question, prompt, and explain procedures that might have been challenging for students to handle on their own.
Children are placed in Foster Care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, abuse, and even exploitation.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they do.
We believe that the Foster Care System is a safety net for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were not provided in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication as well as interpersonal.
The specific features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as aspects of new motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience responses to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that it is possible to determine whether an individual is lying by accurately interpreting micro-expressions.
In his paper The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks suggested how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior can be shared by animals like domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: cryptic and expressed.
A mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Separating and recombining moves back and forth between two pools with each generation.
Out on the savanna, it's difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, failing to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant resources would be the proteins available in leaves and pods, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they also provide a lot of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
Having considered everything, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors had solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as the chimpanzees on the savanna do today.
Disrupting sleep is the process of purposefully waking up during your regular sleep period and falling asleep a little later (10-60 minutes).
It is possible to do this easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to awareness without fully waking you.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythm include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which we know is a diuretic) before sleeping, forcing someone to go urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in one's body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force that is present. Every individual has the potential to find complete peace and contentment.
Everyone is capable of reaching enlightenment. The only thing that obstructs this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was extended by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of complete love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The central focus of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Deity. By visualizing various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are energized, and the awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the USA. With the end of the war, conflicts arose in terms of system, process, and culture, causing the countries to quarrel.
Within two years of the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It would continue for the next 40 years and would be fought indirectly, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish garrison had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were almost overnight replaced when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after attacking the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The most efficient way by far to transport large numbers of people and goods across oceans is to use ships.
Traditionally, the work of navies was to ensure that your country maintained the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, disrupting your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to stop this traffic, mainly using U-boats.
If the Alliance had failed, it is likely that Germany would have been able to invade Britain as it did in the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
In general, domestic goats were kept in herds that roamed on hills or other grazing areas, often overseen by goat herders, who were usually children or young people, similar to the more well-known shepherd. These herding methods are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th Century.
Although wagon rails consisted of parallel wooden planks only, they enabled horses to pull them to achieve higher speeds and carry larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the period.
Slippers (timber cross-ties/sleepers) were introduced quite early to hold the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that tracks would be more efficient if they had a strip of iron on the top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wagon's wooden wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first full iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the first mode of travel that we know about, human beings began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as often.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is exactly like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we do not want just a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems, and we should alleviate them.
It's quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to scientific and technological developments of humanity, and problems have become greater because of overpopulation and humanity's wasteful way of living.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to the print shop of John Dunlap.
Throughout the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, now referred to as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of this document by John Nixon was in the Independence Hall yard on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6 and was read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadleaves known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Not many people think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds have many features that still look like a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Every computer in practical use today is based on processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits, or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
Perhaps the best sign of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic chemicals in the home.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists formally use the term beetles for this group of insects.
The term comes from being well-acquainted with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Assassin beetles and bed bugs are colorless, adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
Across the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
Multiple Sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to develop Multiple Sclerosis as men.
A couple can decide that it is not in their best interest, nor in the best interest of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main purpose of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides most scientific research.
However, he is not alone; experimenting, which is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible theories, asking questions, and making observations, also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all matters of science, including psychology.
As the understanding of Greek deteriorated, the West found itself divorced from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
A number of rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue with a period of free-running cycling even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the earliest indications that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments by either marking the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are lineage cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, but mutations elsewhere can cause cells to die or cause cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, taking photos of, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in the country in cars to go to their workplaces and they are passed by others who are going to their work destination in the place they have just left.
In this dynamic shuttle transport, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on private cars, and supports the system.
By now, science suggests that this enormous carbon economy has knocked the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems elicit such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two places and the interaction they make with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic streams tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help to plan, design, and implement road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are the dragonfly and mayfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moves around the Sun.
Some people believed he was right, but many people thought the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest on Earth. It carries more than 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at six miles wide at times.
20 percent of the water flowing out of the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza have never been surpassed in terms of their size or the technical mastery of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were at the time well over a thousand years old.
Around 800 is the population of Vatican City. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official correspondence.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all of these can be found in their native form and they are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything was made of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more akin to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what you see.
Essentially, alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also get alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of substance. Every substance is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerge, the pencil has been relegated to a lesser status and use.
People now write messages on computer screens without having to go near a pen.
One can only guess what the keyboard will be when something newer comes.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to form a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's quite similar to rolling a heavy cart up a hill. Splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and about 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more moon craters on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on what drives people or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories look at what makes specific people want the things they want and what things in their environment will make them do or not do specific things.
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory are two popular content theories.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge as managers begin to lead their former peers. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, performing disciplinary actions, performance assessments, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, one turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels the need to change everything the team has been doing and take ownership of it.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members as their team may meet across different time zones that their local managers may not understand.
There is a real presence of an "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) which is also a unique component of the virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team that every member reports to. The invisible team sets the standards for every member.
Why would an organization want to go through the laborious process of creating a learning organization? One goal of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across an organization's functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process of the organization working together to overcome obstacles can lead to a new innovative process to serve the customer's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation as well as common knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006), explains the Continuum method as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neuroscientific data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating cognition. Therefore, it narrows the field of research and makes it much more detailed.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior assists scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, traumas, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental operations.
The advancement of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although there is a significance of science fiction to Artificial Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
Research in Artificial Intelligence involves making machines automate work that requires intelligent behavior.
Examples include management, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer diagnostics and customer questions, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the armed forces, as it is built into many home computer applications and video game software.
Field trips are an important part of any classroom. Quite often a teacher would love to take her students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can look at artifacts in museums, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a field trip virtually is a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, the website is remodeled every year, but old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students often begin their blogging experience with messy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to strive to improve writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to sustain the audience's interest inspires students to be capable and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to materials on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of other writings as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada and features a variety of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further to the south is Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as what is considered completely Canadian by people from outside.
Large areas further to the north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost wilderness with no one living in them.
For a comparison that surprises many people: there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are citizens of Canada.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in its own right in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as luxurious beach holiday destinations.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it gained a significant foothold in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence and colonization of Europe began in the 15th century, as the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region borders the Sahel, and in the south and west with the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences could lead to what they would consider harassment, and that it's not uncommon to be followed, have your arm grabbed, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men, and do not be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it does not make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was established by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and it was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole spectrum of jewelry, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the town's roads, especially the town center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visits outside of Goma should be investigated to understand the condition of the ongoing fighting in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo as well as tracking Mountain Gorillas, which is among the cheapest in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorbike taxi) to travel around Goma. The usual (local) fare is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Along with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poorer town, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger, because of the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stopping places during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special program, Wonders of the African World.
The city completely contrasts with other cities in the country, because it has more of an Arabian than African instinct.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each hosting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered a key symbol of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are conservation fees and daily access charges for the Park.
It could also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to either a selection of parks or all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place many tourists consider as the main focal point.
The parade of buildings forming Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a bright bar chart made visible by the presence of Victoria Harbour's water.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite Kowloon shores.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island has been densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonizers took as their own, and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove area in the world, extending 80 kilometers (50 miles) inland into the heartland of Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Sundarbans National Park is the name of the part of the forest that falls within Indian territory.
However, the forests are not only mangrove swamps - they include some of the last stands of the great jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, a third of which is covered with water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a sanctuary for wildlife, and it is estimated that there are 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area now.
Buses leave the inter-district bus station (over the river) throughout the day, although the majority, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
As buses between areas are often full, you are advised to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil with Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction work was completed in August 2011, it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are anticipated to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group living in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was born, which was previously called "The Giant Province of the Indies", as a result of the meeting of Spanish conquerors with the indigenous native groups.
The Spaniards began the colonization period, and it lasted for three centuries.
Since the establishment of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its native character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
There are also smaller tournaments and games to be seen here at other times of the year.
To get news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo games, check the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP) and its value is the same as the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, which is located in Stanley across the road from the FIC West shop.
In general, British pounds are accepted anywhere on the islands and within Stanley credit cards and US dollars are often accepted too.
On the remote islands, it is likely that credit cards will not be accepted, although British and US currency might be accepted; check with the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so you should exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold; temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain received remains more or less the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals.
However tame they may seem, wild oxen, moose, elk, bears, and almost every large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so allow them their space.
Additionally, be aware that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was established in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town led to the killing of the chief officer Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland occupies two harbors. The most popular ones are in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
The whole place is almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are on Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded with a good range of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One", it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The name of the other local beer is "Manta".
There are a number of wines from France available, but wines from New Zealand and Australia might travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you're concerned.
For the people of Australia, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. An "espresso" is a short black, a cappuccino comes loaded high with cream (not froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
There are many trips to the reef throughout the year, and injuries due to any of those incidents on the reef are rare.
However, you should take advice from authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish can be seen near beaches and river estuaries between October and April north of 1770. Occasionally they can be found outside these times.
Sharks exist, however they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the sea; their primary habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that she will have a place to sleep once she reaches her destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you might find it possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or acquire other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, inquiries about any changes or requests should be made through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of those attending music festivals camp on site, and most attendees consider it to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the events, you will need to go in early to get a campsite close to the music.
Although the music on the main stages has finished, remember that parts of the festival may continue to play music until late at night.
Some holidays have designated camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the Northern Baltic in the winter, you should check the location of the cabin, as going through a row causes quite a terrible noise for those most affected.
The Saint Petersburg cruises include time in the town. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money guests spend. There are typically no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drink, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and keep them in the building.
Some venues offer free alcoholic drinks. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and every good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall to trap you in a very short time.
Visibility can also be restricted by falling or blowing snow or by mist or frost on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic usually continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Perhaps safaris are the biggest attraction for tourists in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in general use refers to traveling over land to see Africa's stunning wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars and standard equipment will allow good viewing.
Lions, hunting leopards, and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
The walking safari (also known as a "wild walk", "hiking safari", or even "trek") involves hiking, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two summer Olympic Games, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might have a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies did not extend to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
It is expected that most of the tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing about ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help to dry them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for borrowing, even if one is not present in the room.
If no iron is available, or if you are not inclined to wear ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to allow the fabric to get too hot (which can cause shrinking, or in extreme cases, burning).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, in other areas it needs several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have concerns, then you should consider purchasing your water in a bottle sealed by a reputable company.
Travelers might encounter pests they are not familiar with in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause painful itching, or in a worse case cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, nor dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and duties in certain locations.
Travelers going to countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, particularly on products like alcoholic drinks and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, frequently passing through isolated rural landscape.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be alert: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are common.
Speed limits posted are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections - typically 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 kilometers per hour) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
Strangely, however, the mobile phone service is much stronger here than along many other parts of the road, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry cakes are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastry cakes are common, with apples cooked into crusts throughout the year, and cherries and plums appearing during the summer.
Many baked goods from Germany contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you have a craving for small but rich pastry cakes, try the ones called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Knapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in Southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a vast array of regional foods found throughout the nation.
But, if it is used without additional conditions, the term tends to refer to the food that originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Available widely throughout the archipelago now, Javanese cuisine includes an assortment of simply flavored dishes, with the main flavors favored by Javanese people being peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese palm sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the feet of the rider that hang down on either side of the saddle.
They offer more stability to the rider but they can have safety issues due to the possibility of the rider’s feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but their foot is caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse runs away. To reduce this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a relatively narrow, smooth sole.
Next, some saddles, especially saddles from England, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to come off the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - the main climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and rocks.
The peaks offer incredible views of mountaintops. Climbers from all over the world are continuously establishing new routes among its endless potential of walls.
Snow sports downhill, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski buffs", who plan entire vacations around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depict skiers as far back as 5000 BC!
Skiing downhill as a sport dates back to at least the seventeenth century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related to but does not include skiing or alpine climbing, the latter on steep terrain and requiring much stronger skis and boots.
Think of the ski path as a similar walking path.
In good conditions you can travel distances somewhat greater than walking - but very rarely will you get cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy rucksack on rugged trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport controls multiple times.
However, the Schengen area operates somewhat like one country in this regard.
As long as you remain in this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for each Schengen member country separately, saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no general definition for which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit might be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted products can be defined as antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood among the Sámi, and the culture associated with the craft is also important to many with other professions.
Nevertheless, even traditionally, not all Sámi have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but have lived from fishing, hunting, and the like, and have mainly kept reindeer as draught animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern crafts. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
Although it is widely used, especially among those who are not Romani, the word "Gypsies" is considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and the incorrect perception of Romani people.
If the country you are visiting becomes the subject of a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance could be affected.
You may also wish to consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their own citizens.
As one example, American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Advisory documents are a brief summary of the political situation in only one country.
The viewpoints presented are often superficial, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious disruption to society, or loss of human lives.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of it that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive moisture, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather affecting their area as it may impact any travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that might be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
It is likely that an Internet search for "Hostile environment course" will provide directions to a local company.
A course will usually cover every topic discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
Usually, a course will run from 2-5 days and will include role play, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are rare.
Passengers planning to undergo surgery abroad must ensure that they carry valid documents for the return journey.
Governments' willingness to issue passports with an unspecified gender (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is equally widely varied.
Searches in security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the period after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet undergone surgery should not expect to pass through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
A rip current is the flow that comes back from waves breaking off the shore, often in a reef or something similar.
Due to the underwater topography, the returning flow is concentrated in a few deeper spots, and a fast current to deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion when trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you come out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for somewhere you haven't been caught yet, or, depending on your skills and whether someone has noticed you, you may want to wait to be rescued.
A reverse culture shock occurs sooner than a culture shock (there is a shorter honeymoon period), it lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adjusted to the new culture sometimes find it especially difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When returning home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits from your home culture.
When you first went abroad, it's likely that people were patient and tolerant, knowing that travelers in a new country have to adapt.
It is possible that people do not foresee that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually, you always hear the noise of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is set as a background and narrator of a long story.
The sights are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the largest number of stations, with fifteen operational in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 kilometers north of the Peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception where a still active flooded caldera provides a striking natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the region to the south of the Peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here join the plateau, then reappear to form the 360-kilometer Ellsworth Mountains chain, divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range of Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson Massif, is topped by Mount Vinson at 4892 m.
In remote locations, without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone might be your only choice.
A satellite phone generally does not replace a mobile phone, as you have to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as journeys with remote data and voice needs.
Your local phone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
Traveling and learning is an increasingly popular choice for those planning a gap year.
This is particularly popular among those who are leaving school, allowing them to take a year out before going to university, without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a year-long course abroad can improve your chances of moving to higher education back in your home country.
Usually, there is a tuition fee to register for these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and the lakes you do not necessarily need a sailing boat.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the larger lakes are indeed large enough for any sailing boat, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national leisure activity in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (e.g., in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
The majority of the different Baltic Cruises include a long stopover in St Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a couple of days as well as return and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore using cruise ship excursions, you won't need a separate visa (in 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin, Germany in the brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea at all and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from fears and dislikes of other things that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear based on the unknown or on not having control.
Transport companies are well paid for delivering things quickly. Often, time is very important with business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
In some ways, the larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If they had sent things by air freight, on some routes it might have taken days to go through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked luggage. The airline's regulations will not allow them to send bags without a traveler, and that's where you become relevant.
The obvious way to fly in first class or business class is to pay a hefty sum of money for the privilege (or, even better, have your company do it on your behalf).
However, this is not cheap: as a rough rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the usual economy price for business, and eleven times for first class!
Generally, there's no point in even looking for discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a specific core group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and charge the appropriate fee.
Chişinău is the capital of Moldova. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any United Nations member country.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure in political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
At one time in the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed, and busy commercial center, set around a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are scattered with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more akin to the Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvik offers views of the neighboring island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves over some graves.
It's worth half an hour to take a walk around the interesting village.
To the north and within easy reach lies the very romantic and interesting town of Sintra, which was made famous to foreigners after a laudatory report of its splendors by Lord Byron.
The 403 Scotturb Bus travels to Sintra regularly, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, a place world-renowned for the apparitions of Mary.
Remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave site, as well as a site of almost immeasurable significance to a substantial portion of the world's population.
Many men and women are still alive who survived their time here, and many more had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death here, Jews and non-Jews alike.
You should treat the site with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by marking or scratching graffiti into structures.
Catalan and Spanish are the official languages of Barcelona. About half prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and essentially everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most of the signs are displayed in Catalan only because it has been established by law as the first official language.
And yet, Spanish is widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the Metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a bad reputation for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is often just an incorrect stereotype, the best way to get ahead in Paris is to be on your best behavior, acting like someone who is "bien élévé" (well brought up). It will make moving around quite a bit easier.
The abrupt behaviors of the people of Paris will quickly disappear if you show some basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce, and pine trees, and contains a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
He has a remarkable diversity of plant communities, due to his range of microclimates, different soils, and varying altitude levels.
The area is also home to a very wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie can be found there, as well as many more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts over the knees and have something over their shoulders, too.
Most monasteries provide cloaks for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or the nun at the entrance.
Along the same lines, men must wear trousers that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance but those clothes are not washed after each user so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
Food from Mallorca, like foods from similar regions in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil throughout.
A simple popular meal, especially in the summer, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available toppings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Every name, alongside the word Sie for you, always begins with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method of differentiating between some verbs and objects.
It can also be argued that it makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or an adjective is being used in a nominalized form.
Pronunciation is quite easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly the way they are written.
The main letters to look out for are c and g, as the way they are pronounced varies depending on the vowel that follows.
Also, make sure you pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means vehicle.
Persian grammar is relatively easy and consistent on the whole.
So, reading this grammar book would help you understand a lot about Persian grammar and understand phrases better.
Needless to say, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories have usually fallen into disuse by today, and are used as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution was not a problem in their heyday as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to reach than those built in the modern era.
Most modern research telescopes are vast facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Seeing the cherry blossom, or hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the emperor would hold the first cherry blossom parties around the Imperial Court only for himself and other members of the nobility.
Plants look their best when in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to pick even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally organized garden, collecting "specimens" will also get you thrown out, without discussion.
Singapore is an exceptionally safe place to be in general and very easy to get around, and you can buy almost anything upon arrival.
However, being located in the "high tropics" a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to cope with heat (all the time) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less frequently).
A few buses also go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you intend to take is going to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme to base your holiday on.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or take a river cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or take a boat along the Erie Canal.
They also define ways for popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it celebrates the birthday of Jesus.
A number of holiday traditions are also followed by non-believers living in Christian countries and non-Christian people around the world.
There is a tradition of staying awake on Easter night in some open place to see the dawn break.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may have been a pre-Christian Spring and Fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with congregations often beginning to celebrate at midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the vast distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans to the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark more or less around the clock.
Since the population of the areas is sparse, and light pollution is therefore not often a problem, you will also be able to see the stars.
The working culture of Japan is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners might be accustomed to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their family names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is essential, emphasizing group effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often need to get approval from their bosses for any decision they make, and they are expected to obey their bosses' instructions unquestioningly.
