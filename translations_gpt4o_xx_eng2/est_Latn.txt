Besides proving that at least some dinosaurs had feathers – an already widely accepted theory – it allows us to see details not usually visible in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the animal's plumage was chestnut brown, and its underside was light or yellowish-red.
The discovery allows a glimpse into the evolution of birds' feathers.
Since the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a developed quill, which is called a rachis, but they do have other parts of feathers – barbs and the downy base of the feather blade –, scientists concluded that the rachis likely evolved evolutionarily later than the other parts.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers proposed that the specimen is an example of adult plumage, not chick down, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur.
Scientists hypothesized that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage rather than chick down feathers.

In France, voting has traditionally been a technology-free experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, place a pre-printed paper with the name of the chosen candidate in an envelope.
After the officials confirm the voter's identity, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.

Candidates may send representatives to monitor every part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, who follow specific instructions.

In her second competition, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's category with a combined time of 4:41.30, which is 2:11.60 minutes slower than the time of the Austrian Claudia Loesch who took first place, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the time of the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani who took ninth place.
Four skiers in the women's starting group did not finish, and 45 of the 117 participants in the giant slalom did not receive a place in the competition.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General of Police D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five individuals who raped the Swiss woman and have recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with covered faces.
When the car hit the house, there were three people there, but none of them were hurt.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed until the rescue service freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
Originally, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been charged with the murder of her son in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
He is being held in custody until the charges are filed and the court hearing takes place, but any eyewitness testimonies may be of questionable value because his picture has been published in many places.
In other parts of Great Britain, it is a common practice, but in Scotland, the administration of justice operates differently, and the courts consider the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee noted that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line by publishing photos of suspects, etc."
Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made at least until charges are filed.
According to the leak, the document refers to a border dispute in which Palestine wants it to be based on the pre-1967 Middle East war border.
The topics discussed included the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both peoples, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that after the signing of the agreement, military presence in the valley is ensured for ten years, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to keep the military there for only five years.
The shooters participating in the additional pest control experiment were closely monitored by forest rangers, as the experiment was under observation and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
Qualified volunteers were recruited under the hunting program of the Shooters Association in the partnership of NPWS and the Australian Shooters Association (NSW).
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park Protection and Cultural Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Martelly inaugurated a new nine-member provisional electoral council yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth Interim Electoral Council (CEP) in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission issued a recommendation for the previous acting president to resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The motivation behind the sporadically violent protests was the failure to organize elections, some of which had been anticipated since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPod malfunctions due to overheating have been reported, which have caused six fires and resulted in minor burns to four people.
According to the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), there have been 27 accidents related to equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
In response, the ministry called the postponement of Apple's report "truly regrettable."
An earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time in the morning (09:19 GMT Friday evening).
The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands' Emergency Management Agency stated that no damages were reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there are no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in the Philippine capital, Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle towards the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and it has been confirmed that at least six are dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier along with the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers took the place of an old lady who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was neutralized by shooting.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and made a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and started working in Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While Liggins was working at the hospital, he began researching premature birth in his free time.
His studies showed that when a certain hormone is administered to the fetus, it accelerates the development of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two black box flight recorders on Wednesday.
Even the wrestling colleagues paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, “Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna left us on the night of the new moon. Quite unique, just her style. A strong woman.”
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as I am ... maybe even weirder ... love her and miss her ... hopefully she's in a better place now."
Of the 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of those against Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed that in her opinion, Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the survey participants agree, wishing for Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the results, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic at the earliest opportunity, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle swimming and in three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to complaints, his readiness is in doubt.
He has not been able to take the medication he needs to overcome the pain because they are banned in the Olympics.
Mathematician and University of Central Missouri computer science professor Curtis Cooper discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets supplied the Earth with water, along with organic substances capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, as comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and signed the law to legalize same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors political gossip and nonsense.
It is speculated that he will run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
Instead of older ground-based radar technology, it uses satellite-based technology, which allows controllers to more accurately determine the locations of aircraft and provide pilots with more precise information.
"Additional transport is not provided and overground trains do not stop at Wembley, furthermore, there are no overground parking lots or 'park and ride' facilities."
In fear of a lack of transportation, the possibility was raised that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without team supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday announced the emergence of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands, which belong to Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden announced that a new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer. An endemic medium ground finch, Geospiza fortis, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris, interbred.
Gold can be processed into all kinds of forms. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted or braided. It can be hammered or rolled into thin sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books, which were called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make yourself an indicator with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (basic) the chemical is.
The level of pH indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (H stands for hydrogen in pH) in the investigated chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then squeeze it into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture of your hands reacts with the outer layers, creating a funny sensation and forming a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a complex sewer system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in Crete, in the houses of the cities of the Minoan culture, and in Santorini, Greece.
Toilets existed also in Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women were mixed.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere slightly distorts light and view.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a gigantic rocket over 100 feet high is needed.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The most significant change the wheel has brought us is considerably easier and faster transportation.
Thanks to this, we have a train, a car, and many other means of transport.
On the tier below them are medium-sized felines, whose prey includes medium-sized animals, ranging from hares to antelopes and goats.
Lastly, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat significantly more small prey animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is a niche concept, the specific work each cat does, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups, or prides.
Herds consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and pups.
Females are usually very closely connected with each other, forming a large family consisting of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave much like wolf and dog packs – animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) and are also very deadly to their prey.
Tiger, a versatile athlete, can climb (although not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. Only these four big cats can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the loud roar of a lion, but rather a phrase shouted in a growling manner.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If possible, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot preys on are considerably smaller than it is.
According to scientists, ocelots track and find prey (victims) by scent, sniffing places where they have been.
Their ability to see in the dark is excellent, and they move very stealthily. The ocelot blends into its surroundings to hunt prey and then pounces on its target.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they originate (for example, by moving over a mountain range or river or relocating to a new island, and returning is not easy), they often end up in an environment different from the previous one.
In the new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new population requires different traits than previously necessary and must adapt to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
As time passes and the new population adapts to its new environment, they look less and less like the other population.
As a result, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable result of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which people exhale.
Plants make food for themselves from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and produce clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosaurus was the apex predator of its time and thus feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
In his long jaws, there were over 70 razor-sharp teeth, in addition to extra teeth on the palate, which means that nothing that crossed his path escaped.
It is not known for certain, but the Mosasaurus might have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it might even have been a man-eater.
He attacked everyone who went into the water, even a giant dinosaur like T-Rex would be no match for him.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference was that although poor people and women ate sitting on chairs, wealthy men enjoyed feasts where they ate while reclining.
Foods of Ancient Rome could not include ingredients that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's home.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests attended to the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard and an inner shrine, which only priests may enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house was not so important.
The Jewish family conducted most of their activities outdoors.
The women cooked outside; the shops were simply open counters facing the street. The houses were built of stone.
There was no large forest in Canaan, which made wood extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he discovered Greenland and named it.
Despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although every country was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text is located at the bottom of the document, turned upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in its early years, the large parchment document (measuring 29 ¾ by 24 ½ inches) was stored rolled up.
It is likely that the note was simply added as a tag.
D-Day and the subsequent battles liberated the northern part of France, but the southern part was still not free.
The Vichy French were in control there. These were the people of France who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France, an action that came to be known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the liberated French forces had freed the south of France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people living and working together, also known as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means "citizen-related," and is associated with the Latin words civis, "citizen," and civitas, meaning "city or city-state," and it also somewhat defines the size of a society.
City-states are the predecessors of countries. Civilizational culture means the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and sufficient cultural dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies initially formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, with Congress being its only component.
The Congress lacked the power to levy taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on the state authorities to implement all legislation, who often were not very cooperative.
He also did not have the authority to repeal tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is the most successful team in the world alongside the Germany national football team, and they won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in this field at international and Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of Japanese islands, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago in geographical terms.
Taiwan was mentioned as early as the 15th century when European sailors passing by noted down the island's name as Ilha Formosa or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the indigenous grain production practices and hiring Chinese workers to work in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing Dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, transferring the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures – namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common film format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced today, but even more importantly, its proportions have been passed down to the dimensions of digital camera image sensors.
The 35 mm format is actually somewhat confusingly 36 mm wide and 24 mm long.
The aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore thought to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the group of APS formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The often exploited and frequently ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics by maintaining a sense of order in the image.
According to this, the most effective position for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines, dividing the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, began to be carefully monitored.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had united European countries, despite the differences in their languages and customs.
Its all-encompassing power influenced everyone, from the king to the common citizen.
One of the main beliefs of Christians is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the financial resources of the church are intended precisely for this purpose.
The center of church power had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money raised the question for many whether this principle was adhered to.
Quite soon after the start of hostilities, Great Britain began the naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective – it cut off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law, which has been documented in several international treaties over the last two centuries.
The United Kingdom deployed mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire ocean areas, putting even neutral vessels at risk.
Because there was no particular reaction to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, a large part of the citizens and people were pacifist and isolationist-minded.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, countries wished to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job in New York City at the Edison Company.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his last job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of describing different periods of time; each phase of Chinese history or each ruling family had its own dynasty.
There was also an era of unstable divided provinces between each dynasty. The most famous of these eras was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce battles took place among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history – thousands of people died in mutual battles, as they hoped to attain the highest position of power in the Xi'an Grand Palace.
There are many social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not a sole ruler.
Even after the Revolution, fields of activity were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and successful to achieve success.
The same applied to the military, because instead of the ranks being based on class, they were now based on military merit.
The French Revolution also inspired the representatives of the oppressed working class in many other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad had a great interest in things deeper than worldly life. He often used to contemplate in a cave located on Mount Noor ('Light'), which became known as Hira.
A cave that has witnessed ages provides a vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world, located at the top of a mountain north of Mecca.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find if it is known to exist. Once in the cave, it is completely isolated.
There is nothing to see except the clear beautiful sky and numerous surrounding mountains. Very little from this world is heard and seen inside the cave.
The Pyramid of Cheops is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that has survived to this day.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, is one of the many giant pyramid structures built in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), numerous small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The sign "bow upright" resembles the letter V, and the sign "bow down" resembles a clip or a square, missing the bottom side.
"Up" means that you should start at the tip and push the bow, and "down" means that you should start at the frog of the bow (the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull it.
An upward stroke creates a softer sound, whereas a downward stroke is stronger and more forceful.
Feel free to write down your own markings, but remember that the printed bars are included there for a musical reason and should be respected.
Frightened Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), along with the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to leave Versailles for Paris on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd that shouted and yelled threats at the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows open.
At one point, a member of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the horrified queen.
The costs of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover expenses and bond interest passing through Wall Street banking institutions on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super-profits earned from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the elementary profits of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order.
The era during which these events took place is called the High Middle Ages, and it was a period in European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by agreement is considered to end in the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses a variety of ideas in practice, from technological momentum or technological imperative to the firm belief that human destiny is driven by the logic associated with the laws of science and its manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely influenced by culture or politics, and that technology itself exerts an influence on society that is more intrinsic than socially conditioned.
For example, it can be said that the existence of motor vehicles definitely necessitates the development of roads.
However, the domestic road network is not economically viable with only a few cars, which is why efforts are being made to develop new production methods to reduce the cost associated with owning a car.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher number of accidents occurring on the road, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques for repairing injured bodies in healthcare.
An important part of Romanticism was cultural determinism, which relied on writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures related to geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the location of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a place where all luxuries were concentrated began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century mainly because the crusaders had returned with gifts such as silks and spices, which were more valuable than what was available in Byzantine markets.
At that time, the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, the dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture typical of the East.
However, due to the slow communication channels, styles in the West could lag behind by about 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most remarkable developments resulting from the Crusades during this time was that people started using buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is agriculture in which food is produced in quantities sufficient only to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Natural farming is a simple, often nature-close system where seeds obtained from that ecological region, crop rotation, or other relatively simple methods are used to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers have engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite individuals with similar ideas who feel that societal standards do not apply to them, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that enable a subculture to be distinguished can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a mixture of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signify their membership through the use of a unique and symbolic style, which includes fashion, manners of behavior, and argot.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to focus on those few unfortunate cases where adults failed to socialize children during upbringing due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse.
Children like these are called feral. People (often their parents) have kept feral children confined; in some cases, parents abandoned a child due to severe intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others were reportedly raised by animals, and some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
If a child is raised entirely by an animal, the wild child will behave (within physical limits) almost exactly like the animal that raised him, for example, he will fear people or be indifferent towards them.
Although project-based learning should facilitate and make acquisition more interesting, the educational scaffolding approach is a step further from it.
The scaffolding method is not a teaching method, but rather a way to support people who are acquiring a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, the support can be either a teacher or the small paperclip character from Microsoft Office.
Virtual steps will be integrated into the software aimed at questioning, referencing, and explaining procedures that may be too complex for a student to handle alone.
Children are taken to orphanages for various reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, yet it happens.
We find that the foster family system represents a safe zone for these children.
The aim of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable medical care.
A foster family should provide all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The peculiarities of the internet add additional dimensions from the perspective of use and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are cited as important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as new motivating aspects when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries in interpreting facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds, known as micro-expressions.
It is primarily claimed that by correctly interpreting microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks highlighted in his article "The President's Speech" that people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can nevertheless accurately recognize sincerity.
He even suggested that such abilities to interpret human behavior also exist in animals, such as domesticated dogs.
Research conducted in the twentieth century has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
A mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the collection of expressed variations.
In the case of separation and recombination, diversity fluctuates back and forth between the two pools in each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to humans to meet its amino acid needs using the available plants.
What's more, if this is not successful, it will have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant sources would have been the proteins in leafy greens and vegetables, but for primates like us, they are easy to digest only when cooked.
Conversely, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
Considering all of this, we should not be surprised that our own ancestors solved their light problem in much the same way as chimpanzees do today in the savannah.
Sleep disturbance is the process of purposefully waking up during the usual sleep period and falling back asleep after a short period (10–60 minutes).
It is easy if you use a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you to consciousness but does not wake you up completely.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm clock while sleeping, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based choices include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or well-known diuretic tea) before bedtime to force yourself to wake up to urinate.
The amount of a person's inner peace is inversely related to the amount of tension in the body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive the present life force is. Every person can find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle to reaching this goal is tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was expanded with the Mahayana path of love and various Indian yoga techniques.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It involves kundalini yoga, meditation, and a path of all-encompassing love.
Through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations, Kundalini energy (enlightening energy) is awakened in Kundalini yoga.
The core of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of deities. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and an enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the countries fell out due to clashes of systems, processes, and cultures.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were already enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years, and commissioned armies were meant to actually fight on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defense had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup around the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans almost fell through overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after conquering the eastern territories of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
The use of ships for transporting goods is undoubtedly the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the task of navies has been to ensure that a country can move people and goods, while at the same time hindering the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most recent notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans tried to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Great Britain like the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were originally domesticated about 10,000 years ago in Iran's Zagros Mountains.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them to have easy access to milk, wool, meat, and leather.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed on hills or other pastures, and were often herded by child or teenage goatherds, similar to the more well-known shepherds. These herding methods are still used today.
Railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagonways consisted merely of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve higher speeds and pull larger loads than on the somewhat rougher roads at the time.
Sleepers were introduced quite early to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the rails are more efficient when there are iron strips on top of them.
It became a common method, but the iron wore the wagon's wooden wheels more.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking — Homo erectus (or upright man) began walking upright two million years ago.
Walking upright was not customary for their ancestor, the Australopithecus.
Examples of specialization in bipedalism can be found in australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To reduce future suffering to some extent, we can start living more environmentally friendly, join the environmental movement, and even become activists.
Often, it's just like treating the symptoms. However, if we don't want only a temporary solution, we must find the root cause of the problem and neutralize it.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a lot due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and problems have increased due to overpopulation and humanity's wasteful lifestyle.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, the manuscript of the draft, signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's print shop located a few blocks away.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap copies.
The first public reading of the document was conducted by John Nixon on July 8 in Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his soldiers in New York on July 9th. A copy of it reached London on August 10th.
25 copies made by Dunlap are the oldest surviving examples of the declaration. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many of today's paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs has survived to the present day. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, birds still have several features that make them look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly feet with claws, they lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in binary numbers format.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or – using computer slang – bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are quite general and do not allow for immediate diagnosis.
A clear sign of ingested poison could be an open medicine package or toxic household chemicals that are nearby.
Look at the instructions on the label for first aid for specific poison.
Entomologists officially use the term bedbug for this group of insects.
The term derives from a long-standing familiarity with bedbugs, which are extremely well adapted to living as parasites on humans.
Both predatory stink bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, adapted to living in a nest or the host's dwelling.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The study found that the occurrence of MS is twice as likely in women as in men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their or the child's best interests.
These couples can choose to put their child up for adoption.
During the adoption process, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights, allowing another couple to become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to determine how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method is the basis of most scientific research.
However, scientific research is guided not only by experimentation – an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses – but also by asking questions and observing.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's scientific views, including those on psychology, were accepted.
As the knowledge of the Greek language declined, the Western world found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many physiological and behavioral observed rhythms often depend on endogenous cycles and their creation through biological clocks.
The occurrence of periodic rhythms, which are not simply reactions to external periodic factors, has been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillatory system that continues with free-running cyclicity even in the absence of external influences.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence suggesting that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They made two experiments, labeling the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be inherited by children, mutations elsewhere may cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural places to enjoy the views as well as wild plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting Borneo orangutans, taking pictures, and learning about them.
Every morning people leave small towns in their cars to go to work, and in turn, they are passed by others whose workplace is located where they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everything is in some way connected to and supports the transport system based on private vehicles.
Science has now shown that this massive carbon dioxide producing economy has disrupted the biosphere from a stable state, which has been favorable for human evolution over the past 2 million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges at a similar level.
Why do transportation systems cause complaints about daily failures? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is a study that examines the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
The study of traffic flows is unfortunately complicated because it is not possible to predict driver behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently, so traffic flows tend to be somewhat reasonably consistent and can be broadly represented mathematically.
To better describe traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections contribute to the planning, designing, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to start moving through the air. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies much more easily and find food and mates much more effectively.
Most insects are able to fold their wings against their bodies.
This gives them more opportunities to find small places to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that are unable to turn their wings backward are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some believed he was right, but many thought the opposite – the solar system with the Sun (and even other stars) moved around the Earth.
It seems reasonable, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. It carries eight times as much water as the world's second largest river.
Amazon is also the widest river on the planet, which is at times six miles wide.
20% of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. Water from thousands of smaller rivers flows into it.
Although the construction of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, nothing surpassed the size of the Giza pyramids or the technical knowledge of their construction.
The people of the new state admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in legislation and official communication.
Italian is also an everyday language used by most people working in the country, while Latin is used in religious services.
All Vatican citizens are Roman Catholics.
People have known the basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since antiquity because they can be found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Philosopher Aristotle suggested that everything is made up of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like four states of matter (in the same order) – solid, liquid, gas, and plasma –, although he also speculated that they form new substances that we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You may also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, when the pencil was first introduced, it was a good friend for many.
The importance and use of the pencil have decreased because, unfortunately, newer writing methods have emerged.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever needing to use a sharpener.
One can only speculate what will happen to the keyboard when something new emerges.
A nuclear bomb works on the principle that it derives energy by bringing together a cell nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they tend to decay with a little nudge or spontaneously.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the front side and 100 km thick on the back side.
It is thinner under ocean ridges and thicker under mountainous areas.
The nearer side may have more seas because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Theories of achievement needs try to understand what drives people to act and what they like.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that are embraced during the maturation into adulthood.
These theories address what makes certain people want the things they do, and which environmental factors make those people do certain things or not.
Two of the most popular need-based theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
When managers start leading their former peers, it can generally elicit two types of behavior. One extreme of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the boys (or girls)."
It is difficult for a manager of this type to make unpopular decisions, call for order, conduct evaluations, assign duties, and give responsibilities to employees.
At the other end of the spectrum is a person who changes beyond recognition, feeling that they must alter everything the team has done so far and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is accountable for the team's success and failure.
Such behavior often causes disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same high standards as regular teams, but there are still small differences.
Virtual team members are often the contact point for their direct real-world group.
They usually have more autonomy than regular team members because their teams may meet according to different time zones, which their local management might not understand.
The existence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The so-called invisible team is the administrative team to whom each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
For what reason would a company undertake the time-consuming process of creating an educational organization? One of the objectives of involving business education concepts in operations is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized across the functional departments of the entire organization, creativity and ingenuity begin to emerge.
As a result, overcoming an obstacle in the company's collaboration may lead to a new inventive process that meets the customer's need.
Before an organization can be innovative, the leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help companies achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Thus, it defines the research field and makes it more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior supports the research of scientists.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
It gave us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us better understand the processes occurring in our brain.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, forms of AI are a very important branch of computer science that deals with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
AI research involves the automation of machines in such a way that they solve tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include verification, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to clients' diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is now often used in economics, medicine, engineering, and military fields, and it is also built into various home computers and video game software applications.
Excursions are a big part of every class. Often the teacher would like to take students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful arts while sitting in class.
Sharing a tour virtually is also a great way to document a trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year, students of North Carolina's Bennett School design a website about their trip to the state capital. Each year the website is redesigned, but old versions are kept as a memento.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills. At the same time, while students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger tries to improve their writing skills to avoid criticism.
"Blogging also 'forces students to better understand the world around them.' Capturing readers' attention encourages students to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004)."
Blogging is a tool that provides inspiration for collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can help students become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students can determine their position in relation to other people's writings and provide insights into their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's fascinating bilingual capital, and it offers a wide selection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and to the north lies Muskoka with the untouched natural beauty of the areas beyond.
Everything mentioned above and more highlights Ontario as characteristic of Canada for foreigners.
The large areas further north are quite sparsely populated and in some places almost uninhabited wild nature.
A surprising population comparison for many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are citizens in Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean near the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of fauna, practically a continent of its own.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or connected with France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it became very popular in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded to the north by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: female travelers are advised to say they are married, regardless of their marital status.
It is also beneficial to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that due to cultural differences, something that they consider harassment might be done, and it is not unusual to experience stalking, grabbing, etc.
Tell the men a firm no and do not be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC. It was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Maronites, who called it Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badyana, and Spanish merchants who established trading centers there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
In the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather products, hookahs, and a whole array of different gadgets, but this is all just for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying most of the city's streets, especially the downtown area.
If Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside Goma should be researched in advance and the status of the ongoing conflict in the North Kivu province should be understood.
The city also serves as a base from which to ascend the Nyiragongo volcano and offers the most affordable opportunities for tracking African mountain gorillas.
To get around in Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price for a short ride is about 500 Congolese francs.
In conjunction with its relatively difficult accessibility, Timbuktu has been used as a metaphor for exotic, distant places.
Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its fame makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops in Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
Compared to other cities in the country, this is completely different, as it has more of an Arabic than African vibe.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and runs along the Mozambique border to the east, with Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River as the southern boundary.
The area of the park is 19,500 km² and it is divided into 14 different ecological regions, each supporting different types of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions, considered the flagship of South Africa's national parks (SANParks).
As in all South African nature parks, this park also has daily conservation and entrance fees.
It might also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to certain South African parks or all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the Hong Kong territory and is a place that many tourists consider the main attraction.
The row of buildings shaping the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to glittering bar charts reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite Kowloon coast.
A large part of the urban development projects on Hong Kong Island are located in the densely populated area along the northern coast.
This is a place that British colonizers took for themselves. Therefore, it's a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of the colonial era of the territory.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest that falls within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only the mangrove tree swamps – they include some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges lowlands.
The area of the Sundarbans is 3850 km², about one third of which is covered by water or wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has also been a nature reserve and it is estimated that currently around 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer live in the area.
Buses depart from the inner area bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since the inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River, connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil with the city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Two towers reach a height of 83 meters, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes each 3.5 meters wide.
The clearance height of the bridge is 15 meters. The construction work was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to the plans, the bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are anticipated to be completed.
The Guarani indigenous people were the most notable native group that inhabited the areas of present-day Eastern Paraguay and led a semi-nomadic lifestyle as hunters who also practiced agriculture for subsistence.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived thanks to hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, as a result of the meeting between Spanish conquerors and indigenous people, Paraguay was born, which was previously called the Giant Province of the Indies.
The Spaniards began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the establishment of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character.
It is well known that Argentina's water polo teams and players are among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can be seen here at other times of the year as well.
For tournament news and polo match ticket information, visit the Asociacion Argentina de Polo website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is set at par with the British pound (GBP).
It is possible to exchange money at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
Generally, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are often accepted as well.
Credit cards are probably not accepted on the islands of the outskirts, although currency from the United Kingdom and the United States may be taken; consult the owners beforehand to determine the appropriate method of payment.
Exchanging Falkland currency outside of the islands is nearly impossible, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; temperatures over +30 °C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity together create a colder feeling than what is shown on the thermometer.
There are no distinct rainy or dry seasons: the amount of rain remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to seeing people, it is still a wild nature and should not be disturbed.
According to park authorities, bears and wolves must be kept at least 100 yards/meters away and all other wildlife at least 25 yards/meters away!
No matter how calm they may appear, bison, wapiti, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they did not keep the proper distance. These are large, wild, and potentially dangerous animals, so give them the necessary space.
You also need to know that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so do not carry or cook strong-smelling foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
A notorious maritime standoff of 1889 occurred at the port, where seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships except for one British cruiser sank. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the freedom struggle led by the Mau movement, one peaceful gathering in the city ended with the killing of the high chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Since Auckland is bordered by two harbors, there are many beaches. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour area) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay (in the north) to Devonport (in the south).
These are almost all sandy beaches where you can swim safely, and most offer shade from tall myrtle trees.
The beaches along Tamaki Drive are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the elite suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are beaches intended for family vacations, occasionally overcrowded, lined with a good selection of shops. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is Number One, which is not complex in taste, but pleasant and refreshing. The name of the other local beer is Manta.
There may be many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be more suitable for travel.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're concerned, bottled water is also easy to find.
The term "flat white" is unfamiliar to Australians. "Short black" refers to an espresso, cappuccino is served with a heap of cream (not foam), and tea is offered without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Throughout the year, many trips are made to the coral reef, and it is rare for any of them to cause damage to the coral reef.
However, heed the authorities, follow all signs, and pay attention to safety-related warnings.
Box jellyfish are present near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of the town called 1770. Occasionally, they can also be found outside of this period.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live entirely in the ocean; their primary habitat is in the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking gives the traveler peace of mind that they have a place to sleep upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agencies often have contracts with specific hotels, but you can find other accommodation options through the travel agency, such as campgrounds.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you wish to think over the offer or obtain other documents for the destination (e.g., a visa).
Any changes and requests should be discussed with the tour operator first, not directly with the hotel.
For some music festivals, most participants decide to camp on site and consider it a very important part of the experience.
If you want to be near the action, you need to arrive early to get a camping spot near the music.
Keep in mind that although the main stages might not be playing music anymore, the festival may have other stages where music is played until late in the evening.
Some festivals have special campgrounds designed for families with small children.
If you cross the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, then check where your cabin is located, because passing through the ice creates quite a loud noise for nearby cabins.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually strive to keep guests there as long as possible and spend as much money as possible. Usually, there are no windows and clocks, and exits are hard to find.
Usually, they have special food, drinks, and entertainment offerings to ensure guests are in a good mood and don't leave.
Some places offer alcoholic drinks on the house. However, being drunk weakens judgment, and all good gamblers know that it is important to stay sober.
Everyone traveling at high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or low temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low, and you cannot drive the same way as on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a short period to get stuck.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic continues mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
The biggest tourism magnet in Africa is probably safaris, which are the highlight of the trip for many visitors.
The popularly used term "safari" refers to land expeditions with the aim of discovering African wildlife, especially savannas.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, come near cars and standard equipment is sufficient to observe them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and easier to see with binoculars.
A safari walk (referred to in English as a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "footing") consists of a hike that lasts either a couple of hours or several days.
The Paralympics take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events are held in other locations in Japan.
From Tokyo, where the 1964 games were held, it will become the only Asian city to have hosted the Olympics twice.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might be in a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were set to take place.
The price of most tickets is expected to be between ¥2,500 and ¥13,000, with regular tickets costing about ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes helps them to dry. Several hotels have an iron and ironing board available for borrowing, even if they are not in your room.
If an iron is not at hand or if you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric become too hot (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient, while elsewhere it needs to be done for several minutes.
The efficiency of filters varies, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from a reliable manufacturer in a sealed bottle.
Passengers may encounter pests that are not known in their home region.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, worse, trigger allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force are not usually classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from taxes and excises at certain locations.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont introduces the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often bypassing landscapes with secluded wooded thickets.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, drive carefully: steep slopes, narrow roads, and sudden bends are common.
Speed limits are noticeably lower than in the preceding and following sections—usually 35–40 miles per hour (56–64 km/h)—and adhering to them strictly is even more important than usual.
Strangely, however, the mobile service here is much stronger than in many other parts of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good and in Bavaria they are rather rich and diverse, resembling those of the southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples baked into the pastries all year round while cherries and plums make their appearance in summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some rich and hearty pastry, try a baked good that is called a berliner, pfannkuchen, or krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices with either meat or vegetables.

Indonesian cuisine is a general term that encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines found throughout the country, offering choices from among 17,000 islands.
But when used without additional qualifiers, the term tends to refer to food that originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.

Stirrups hanging on either side of the saddle are meant to support the rider's feet.
They help the rider maintain better balance, but can be dangerous as the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse, but their foot gets stuck in the stirrup, it may happen that the horse could drag them while running away. Precautions should be taken to reduce this risk.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to come off the saddle if a falling rider pulls it backwards.
In the Cochamo Valley, Chile's main climbing destination known as the Yosemite of South America, there are various granite big walls and rock formations.
From the mountain ridge peaks, breathtaking views unfold. Mountain climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes on these cliffs with endless potential.
Mountain snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular activities that involve descending snow-covered ground on skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity among many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski-bums," who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a particular location.
Skiing is very old – skiers have been depicted on cave paintings as early as 5000 years BC!
Already in the 17th century, alpine skiing as a sport was practiced, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first amateur skiing club in Australia.
Ski hiking: this activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski trekking.
It is related to alpine skiing or mountaineering, but usually does not include them. Alpine skiing or mountaineering is usually done on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a skiing trail as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you can cover somewhat greater distances than by walking, but despite the groomed trails, you will very rarely achieve a cross-country skiing speed similar to skiing without a backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, yet it has many independent countries. Usually, traveling through several countries means that you have to apply for a visa multiple times and go through passport control.
However, in this matter, the Schengen zone functions somewhat like a single country.
As long as you stay within this zone, you are basically able to cross borders without having to go through passport control points again.
If you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa to each Schengen member country separately, saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that determines which manufactured goods are antiques. Some tax authorities define antiques as goods that are older than 100 years.
The definition varies across different geographical regions, for instance, in places like North America, the age limit may be shorter than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be called antiques, even though they are not as old as similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for many Sámi people, and the culture associated with trade is also important for representatives of many other professions.
But even traditionally, not all Sámi were extensively involved in reindeer herding; rather, they lived by fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Nowadays, many Sámi work in modern commerce. In the Sámi region of Lapland, tourism is an important source of income.

If there are travel advisories for the country you are visiting, it may affect your travel health insurance or travel disruption insurance.
You may wish to consult with some other government instead of your own, but their advice is intended for the citizens there.
As an example, American citizens may face different situations in the Middle East compared to Europeans or Arabs.
Travel advisories are merely a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The presented views are often superficial, generalized, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Harsh weather conditions are a general term for any dangerous weather phenomena that have the potential to cause damage, serious societal disruptions, or take lives.

Everyone planning a trip to a country that can be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
An internet search for a hostile environment course will likely result in the address of a local business.
The course usually addresses the issues discussed here much more in detail, typically with practical experience.
The course usually lasts 3–5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about the sustainability of the wild nature are common, but there are few publications about war zones.
Passengers who plan to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they carry valid documents for the return journey.

Searches at security checkpoints have become much more thorough after September 11, 2001.
Pre-operative transsexuals should not assume that they will pass through security checks without their privacy and dignity being affected.
In the case of rip currents, the water flow rebounds back from the shore, often from a sandbank or something similar.
Due to underwater landforms, the returning water flow moves to a couple of deeper spots and there a rapid current may form, heading into deep waters.
Fatigue caused by swimming against the current is responsible for most deaths, because it can be an impossible task.
As soon as you are out of the current, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to move somewhere where it won't pull you in again, or if you don't have enough skills and you've been noticed, you can wait for a rescue team.
The shock associated with returning comes earlier than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter there), lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Passengers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it very difficult to readjust to their local culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your home culture.
In the beginning, people were likely patient and understanding with newcomers from abroad, knowing that travelers need time to adjust to a new country.
People may not foresee that returning travelers might need patience and understanding.
One of the most interesting things for children in this area is the pyramid's sound and light show.
Before the start of the performance, you will see pyramids in the dark and can view them in silence.

Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded crater of an active volcano forms a remarkable natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge here with the plateau, then rise again and form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains, which are split in half by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range are the highest mountains in Antarctica — the Vinson Massif — with the highest peak being Mount Vinson, which stands at 4,892 meters.
In remote locations where there is no mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone does not usually replace a mobile phone because to make a call, you need to be outside, in an unobstructed view of the satellite.
The service is often used by shipping, including cruise ships, as well as expeditions that require data and voice communications.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for gap year planners is to travel and learn.
It is especially popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a gap year before going to university without adversely affecting their educational path.
In many cases, starting a course abroad during a gap year can improve your chances of continuing higher education in your home country.
A tuition fee is generally charged for enrolling in these educational programs.
Finland is a wonderful destination for boating. This so-called land of a thousand lakes also has a thousand islands located both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You do not necessarily need a yacht to travel between the archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are indeed large enough for any kind of hunting, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
A boat trip is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven to eight people.
The indicators are on par in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise, it is a unique phenomenon (e.g., in the Netherlands, this number is one for every forty).

Some excursion brochures highlight the German city of Berlin. As you can see on the above map, Berlin is not located anywhere near the sea, and visiting this city is not included in the excursion price.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if it is their first flight or if they have had traumatic incidents before.

For some, understanding the principles of how aircraft operate and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear based on ignorance or lack of control.
Courier companies are paid well for the fast delivery of parcels. Often, time is crucial for business documents, goods, or spare parts needed for urgent repairs.
On some routes, large companies have their own planes, but on other routes and smaller companies had problems.
When things were sent by air transport, it could take days on some routes for unloading and passing through customs inspection.
The only way to expedite it was to send it as registered baggage. The airline's rules do not allow them to ship baggage without a passenger, and this is where you come in.
The easiest way to fly first class is to shell out a big pile of money for this luxury (or better yet, have your company do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay four times more for business class and 11 times more for first class than for standard economy class!
Generally, there is no point even looking for discounts on business or first-class seats for direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines know very well that there is a group of flyers who are willing to pay a large sum of money for the luxury of flying somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
