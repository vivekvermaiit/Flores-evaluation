This thing doesn't confirm merely that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a widely accepted theory. However, it also provides details that fossils generally cannot offer, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut-brown from above and its underside was pale or carotenoid-colored.
The discovery also provides a deep understanding of feather evolution in birds.
Because the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a fully developed bony series, called the "spinal column," but they have other features of feathers - such as ridges and small protuberances - researchers concluded that the spinal column was most likely a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the wings indicates that they were not used for flying, but only for regulating temperature or for display. Researchers suggest that although this fossil belongs to a small dinosaur, the specimen shows mature feathers, not a chick's down.
The researchers pointed out that although this is a small dinosaur tail, the specimen shows adult bird feathers, not chick feathers.

As for the completed work, most of it is theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations that were recorded about the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was searching for is attributed to the tidal forces between the dark matter in the galaxy and the dark matter in the Milky Way galaxy.
Just as the moon pulls the Earth causing the tides, the Milky Way galaxy pulls the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that it affects normal matter.
That theory explains that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located in a halo-like structure and consists of a large number of small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed paper indicating their preferred candidate in an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope inside the ballot box and signs the voter list.

The candidates can send representatives to monitor every part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under intense supervision following specific procedures.

Sir Keir Starmer QC, Director of Public Prosecutions, made a statement this morning announcing the trial of both Huhne and Pryce.
He resigned, and they will replace him in the Cabinet with MP Ed Davey. MP Norman Lamb is expected to take over the business minister position that Davey is leaving.
They and Price are scheduled to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on the 16th of February.
Among the casualties were 25-year-old Nicholas Alden and 21-year-old Zachary Cuddeback. Cuddeback was the driver.
Edgar Figueroa was wounded in his arm and jaw, while Christopher Schneider needed reconstructive surgery for his face.
Schneider suffers from constant pain, blindness in one eye, and has lost a part of his skull, with his face rebuilt from titanium; all this happened when the Oka weapon failed while it was aimed at a fifth man's head.
Schneider gave his testimony via a video link from a U.S. Air Force base in his home country.
After the Wednesday event, Karbanido competed in two individual races in the championship.
Her first race was the slalom race, where she got a "Did Not Finish" result in her first run. A total of 36 out of 116 competitors received the same result in that race.
Her second race - the giant slalom - saw her finishing in tenth place in the women's sitting category with a total run time of 4:41.30, which was slower by 2:11.60 than the first place Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 slower than the Hungarian Gyongyi Dani, who was in ninth place.
Four skiers from the disabled team failed to complete their runs, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom race failed to place in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone+D812.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said, "We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Botha Kanjar, Rambro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Director Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house at the time the car crashed into it, not one of them got hurt.
Only the driver was seriously injured in the head.
They have temporarily closed the road where the collision occurred, and at the same time, emergency services freed the driver from a red Audi TT car.
They had initially taken him to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since that time, Adekoja has become accused in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court of killing her son.
She is in custody and awaiting charges and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be questionable because her picture has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other places in Britain, but Scottish justice operates differently, and the courts considered that publishing the photos could be biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee indicates that "it seems to me that journalists are certainly heading in a dangerous direction because they published pictures or the like of the suspects' rights."
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for the claims, indicated to the journalists that there will be no further comments until at least after the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders that existed before the 1967 war in the Middle East.
The second topics that are said to have been covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is considered an important issue for both peoples and a problem along the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands the continuation of the military presence in the valley for ten years upon signing an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to this presence for only five years.
The guards were supposed to closely supervise the released individuals in the complementary pest control experiment, because the experiment was under observation and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
In a partnership between the "National Parks and Wildlife Service" and the "Sporting Shooters Association of Australia," qualified volunteers were selected as part of the association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of the Parks and Wildlife Service of NPWS, the four hunters chosen for the first hunting operation have received safety instructions and comprehensive training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday before a new temporary electoral council consisting of nine members.
It is Martelly's fifth interim electoral council in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the temporary electoral council as part of a set of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee was Martelly's response to the large-scale anti-regime protests that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, broke out due to the failure to hold the elections that were supposed to take place since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of "iPod" device overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and four people to suffer minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) of Japan said it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded to Apple's request to postpone the report by saying it was "truly unfortunate."
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 in the morning local time (Friday 09:19 PM GMT).
The Office of Emergency Management in Northern Mariana declared that no damages have been reported in the country.
As the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated, there are no indications of a possible tsunami wave occurring.
A former Filipino police officer held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired shots from his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Many hostages were rescued, and the death of at least six has been confirmed for the time being.
Six hostages were released early, including children and the elderly, in addition to the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman because she needed a break for the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
He did like his father did and made medicine his profession.
He trained as an obstetrician and gynecologist, and then began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Leggins began investigating premature births during his free time, while working at the hospital.
His research showed that administering one of the hormones accelerates lung maturation in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators reviewed the flight recorders, or what is known as the "black box," on Wednesday.
Also, the fellow wrestlers praised Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first extreme queen. My first manager, Luna died on the night of the two moons. A strong woman, there was none like her."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was eccentric like me... and maybe more than me... I love her and miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Among the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the percentage who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those surveyed agree with this viewpoint and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
As for the polarizing opinions in the survey, 29% of those surveyed believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% thought that Australia should never become a republic.
The fitness of the Olympic gold medalist became questionable due to his annoyance, as he was supposed to swim 100 meters and 200 meters freestyle in three stages at the Commonwealth Games.
He couldn't take the necessary medications to overcome the pain because the use of these medications is prohibited in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using different devices and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source for delivering water to Earth, as well as organic materials that can form proteins and support life.
The scientists hope to understand how the planets formed, especially how the Earth formed since the time when comets collided with it long ago.
Komo, aged 53, began his rule earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the rumors as "political talk and nonsense."
He is expected to run for presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration says allows airplanes to fly shorter routes, which will save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-related technology as opposed to the old technology that uses ground radar to allow air traffic controllers to locate an aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more specific information.
There are no additional transportation means, and the ground trains do not stop at Wembley, in addition to the lack of parking spaces and park-and-ride facilities.
The fears of a shortage of transportation means raised the possibility that the match might need to be held behind closed doors, without the presence of the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal "Science" mentioned the origin of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the evolution of new species took just two generations - although it was believed that this process takes much longer - due to the breeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, the medium-sized ground finch, the migrant cactus finch, and the sharp-beaked ground finch.
Gold can be shaped into many forms. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into a sheet.
It can be made very thin, and adhered to another metal, and it can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
They say its name is the pH number of the chemical substance, and you can make an indicator for this number using red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice changes depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical substance.
They measure the pH level by the number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance to be tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons without electrons (as hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then squeeze them with clean, wet hands until they form a ball.
The moisture on your hands will interact with the outer layers, which will make you feel a strange sensation and form a kind of coating.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had toilets with a drainage mechanism in almost every house, connected to an advanced sewage system.
Discovery of remnants of sewage systems in the houses of Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women would go together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it almost at the same moment.
The satellite was sent to space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet tall to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the shape of the world in a remarkable way; however, providing an easier and faster means of transportation remains the most important contribution it made for us.
She got us the train, the car, and many other transportation devices.
There are lower-ranked, medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small predators (including stray pet cats) that eat the more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of status, a special role for each cat that prevents it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social big cats and live in large groups called prides.
A pride of lions consists of one to three adult males, along with up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closer to each other because they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
The pack of lions works like a pack of wolves or dogs, and surprisingly, animals similar to the lion (but not other big animals) have similar behavior and are very lethal to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger knows climbing (even if not very well), swimming, jumping long distances, and pulling with five times the strength of a human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (the genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full sound of the lion's roar, but it is closer to shouting angry words.
Pygmy tigers like to eat small animals; they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals hunted by the pygmy tiger are smaller in size than it.
Scientists believe that cheetahs track and find animals to eat (prey) through their sense of smell; they smell where they have been on the ground.
You can see well in the dark using night vision, and move quietly too; the dwarf leopard hunts its prey by blending in with its surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main group of their population (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or move to a new island where they can't easily return), they will often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
Given that this new environment contains different resources and competitors, the new group needs different qualities or adaptation methods to become a stronger competitor compared to what it initially needed.
There has been absolutely no change to the indigenous people; they still need the same adaptation methods as we have known them.
Over time, as the newcomers begin to adapt to their new environment, their resemblance to the other inhabitants gradually decreases.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the shape of the two groups will be different to the extent that we cannot call them the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is considered an inevitable result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans produce (i.e., exhalation).
Plants get their nutrition from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We repair our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat also comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaur was the dominant predator of its time, so it wasn't afraid of anything, except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 blade-like teeth, in addition to a second set in the roof of its mouth, which means there's no escape for anything in its path.
We do not know for certain, but he might have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and he might have been a carnivore.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T-Rex doesn't compare to it.
While most of their food might be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of unusual or uncommon holiday items, among them wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called the dormouse.
There was another difference: while the poor and women ate their meals sitting on seats, the wealthy men liked to hold banquets together where they would recline on their side during their meals.
It was not possible for ancient Roman meals to include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and not one of the ancient Romans tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
People used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods during celebrations and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard leading to a secluded sanctuary that only the priests are allowed to enter.
Sometimes unique towers were built in the shape of pyramids called ziggurats to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a safe place for the deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not of great importance.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
The women were cooking in the courtyard; the shops were just open tables overlooking the street. Stones were used in building the houses.
There weren't large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Humans have sparsely inhabited Greenland. It is said in the Norse sagas that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland on charges of murder, and when he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were living there before.
There were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history in the countries of "Denmark," "Sweden," "Norway," and "Iceland," despite the fact that each country was "Scandinavian."
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The phrase "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776" was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text appears at the bottom of the document, inverted.
Although the author of this part of the text is not specifically known, we know that the large manuscript (measuring 29¾ inches × 24½ inches) was stored folded at the beginning of its existence.
So, it is likely that the symbol was simply added as a label.
The landing operations on the memorable day and the battles that followed led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was still not liberated.
Vichy ruled France. These are the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
Civilization is a shared individual culture among a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a community.
The origin of the word civilization is from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and it relates to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and this also defines the way of the societal mass.
Autonomous cities are like the ancestors of nations. Civilized culture implies the transfer of knowledge across several generations, a remaining cultural imprint, and the fair dissemination of knowledge.
Minor cultures often fade away without leaving any tangible historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—with Congress as its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked any authority to impose taxes, and due to the absence of a national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
Additionally, you do not have the authority to override the tax laws and tariffs imposed between states.
The materials required unanimous approval by all states before being amended, and the states mocked the central government to the extent that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football, alongside the German national football team, is considered the second most successful team in the world and were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu Island), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago."
Taiwan began on the path of return in the fifteenth century, where European sailors recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or the Beautiful Island.
In the year 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan and began changing the method of native grain production and employing Chinese workers to work in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In the year 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War between 1894 and 1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu city consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings around the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35 millimeters, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
Its production has continued to this day, but more importantly, the shape of the image sensors in digital cameras has inherited the aspect ratio.
The 35mm model is actually a bit confusing, with a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this image is (when divided by 12 to get the ratio to the simplest integer) therefore it will be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the Advanced Photo System formats, for example) have an aspect ratio similar to this.
The rule of three, which is often misused and laughed at, forms a simple guiding principle that creates dynamics while maintaining a degree of order in a clear picture.
It is noted that the most impactful place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see the example).
The Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, was subjected to scrutiny during this period of European history.
The Christian religion united European countries for more than a thousand years despite differences in language and customs.
The overall power I possessed affected everyone, from the king down to the subjects.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth is necessary and should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's cash funds exist specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question the fulfillment of the requirements of the doctrine.
And quickly, Britain moved to blockade Germany by sea after the skirmishes broke out.
The strategy proved its effectiveness; cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade violating generally accepted international law, which was codified and coordinated in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire sectors of the oceans, which threatens even ships that have nothing to do with the war.
Due to a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes among most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the countries wanted to avoid this situation happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work with Edison’s company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous boss) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient Chinese had a unique way of representing different time periods; each stage of China or each dynasty in power was of a different kind.
Additionally, there was an unstable era of divided provinces between each ruling dynasty. The most famous of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
A fierce war broke out during these periods between many nobles in pursuit of the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying in battles for the highest seats in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from autocracy to a republican system, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not just to the ruler alone.
Also, after the revolution, professions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the army because instead of its classifications being based on class, they have now reverted to relying on calibers.
The French Revolution also inspired many of the oppressed working-class people in other countries to ignite their own revolutions.
The Prophet Muhammad was very concerned with matters that transcend this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount "An-Nur" for contemplation.
The cave, which has remained throughout the ages, presents a very vivid image of the spiritual inclinations of the Prophet Muhammad.
The cave is located on the top of a mountain north of Mecca, and it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In truth, it is not easy to find at all, even if you know its location. Once you enter the cave, you become completely isolated.
You can only see the beautiful clear sky above the many surrounding mountains. It's almost impossible to see or hear anything from this world inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid in the Giza Governorate is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists to this day.
It was built by the Egyptians in the third century of the current era; the Great Pyramid is considered one of the massive pyramids built to bury the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), small tombs, temples, and the Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The shape of the "up bow" sign resembles the letter V, and the shape of the "down bow" sign looks like a stapler or a square without the bottom side.
An upper mark indicates that you must start from the end and push the bow, while a lower mark means you must start from the end of the bow (where your hand holds the bow) and pull it.
The upper bow usually produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger and more taut.
Don't hesitate to draw your own marks in pencil, but just remember that the printed curved marks are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
Terrified, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Thérèse, who was 11 years old, and Louis Charles, who was four) and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced on the 6th of October, 1789, to return from Versailles to Paris by a crowd of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a large crowd of people who were shouting and chanting against the king and queen.
A group of fans managed to force the king and queen to open the windows of their car wide.
At one point, a gang member waved the head of one of the slain Royal Guards in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The Filipino people incurred the costs of the imperialist war by the United States of America in its invasion of the Philippines.
These people were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial system to cover a large part of the expenses and interests on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Naturally, the large profits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the primary gains of American imperialism.
We need to understand the context that motivated the creation of the organization in order to understand the Knights Templar.
The era in which those events took place was known as the High Middle Ages, which is the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which altogether ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the push of technology or technological necessity to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
There are two general common ideas in most interpretations of technological determinism: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that this technology in turn has "effects" on embedded societies, rather than being linked to the society.
For example, someone might say that the car's engine needs to be developed alongside the roads.
However, establishing a road network throughout the country is not economically beneficial if there are few cars, so new roads are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The collective ownership of cars also leads to a higher rate of road accidents, which in turn leads to the development of new healthcare technologies to treat affected people.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism derived from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of the romantic movement, geography shaped the people, and over time habits and culture connected to that geography emerged, and these, being compatible with the place of the community, were better than laws imposed by force.
Just as Paris is renowned as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began in the year 400 AD and continued until the year 1100 AD.
Her situation declined during the twelfth century primarily due to the fact that the Crusades returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
At this time, Paris was named the fashion capital instead of Constantinople.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the tenth or eleventh century and the fourteenth century.
In the beginning, Byzantine culture in the East strongly influenced clothing.
Despite that, due to the slow channels of communication, the patterns in the West may be delayed by about 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments at that time as a result of the Crusades was that people started using rice to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is the farming that is done to produce enough food just to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming, which often involves no fertilizers or pesticides, is a simple system that uses stored seeds compatible with the region's ecosystem, along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still present in many developing countries.
Subcultures reconcile like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive due to age, race, class, location, and/or the gender of the members.
Perhaps the traits that define the distinctiveness of a subculture are linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures indicate their right to membership through the distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes clothing, affectation, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who suffered, either through neglect, bad luck, or deliberate abuse, and were not socially connected by adults during their upbringing.
They call these children "wild" or feral. Some street children were confined by individuals (usually their parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to parents rejecting the child's severe mental or physical disability.
The feral children may have been subjected to abuse or severe trauma when they were children before being abandoned or running away.
Others say that they were raised by animals; while it is said that some lived in the wild alone.
When a child is raised by animals rather than humans, the behavior of the feral child (within physical limits) closely resembles the behavior of the particular nurturing animal, such as fear of humans or not taking them into account.
While project-based learning is supposed to make the learning process easier and more interesting, the support goes beyond that.
Interactive learning is not a method of learning, but truly an auxiliary means that provides support for individuals who are undergoing a new educational experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Interactive learning can be virtual and in reality; in other words, the teacher is a form of interactive learning, as well as the paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Interactive learning is supported internally in the program and aims to encourage questioning, motivation, and explaining processes that might be difficult for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons ranging from neglect and abuse to even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that doesn't provide upbringing, care, and education, yet they do.
We understand that the foster care system is considered a safe zone for these children.
Our adoption care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Alternative care must provide all the necessities that they lacked in the homes they left before.
The internet combines elements of both mass and personal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage approaches and ways of satisfaction.
For example, some suggest "learning" and "socialization" as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were identified as new motivational aspects by Amy and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting micro-expressions of the face, which are facial movements that last for a few fractions of a second.
It is specifically claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks indicated in his paper that the president's speech suggests that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are able to accurately assess honesty.
In fact, it suggests the idea that these abilities in analyzing human behavior might be shared with some animals, like domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century clarified the existence of two groups of genetic variations: a hidden group and an apparent one.
A mutation introduces new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the pool of expressive differences.
The processes of separation and recombination work to make the difference randomly move forward and backward between the two groups with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for primates with a digestive system similar to humans to obtain the amino acids they need from the available plant resources.
Failure to do so also leads to severe consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The plant resources that were easily accessible were the proteins we could obtain from leaves and legumes, but these proteins are difficult for primates like us to digest if they are not cooked.
On the contrary, animal foods (ants, termites, and eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they also provide high amounts of proteins and contain all essential amino acids.
When taking everything into consideration, we shouldn’t be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way similar to how chimpanzees do on the savanna.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your natural sleep period and then going back to sleep after a short period (from 10 to 60 minutes).
And you can do this easily using a relatively quiet alarm that lets you regain consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to stop it.
The second options, based on biological systems, include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, one of the known diuretics) before bed, which forces the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
If stress decreases, the positivity granted by the force of life increases. Every person has the inherent ability to find complete peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that hinders us on the path to this goal is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it expanded through the Mahayana path of love and some other techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love that embraces everyone.
The "Kundalini" energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, chants, and visualizations, with "Kundalini Yoga."
The Tibetan meditation center is the deity Yoga. By visualizing the different deities, they cleanse the energy channels, activate the chakras, and create enlightenment awareness.
Germany represented a common enemy in World War II, which made the Soviet Union and the United States cooperate, but at the end of the war, the clash of systems, policies, and cultures led to the outbreak of conflict between the two states.
With two years passing since the end of the war, former allies have now become enemies, and the cold war has begun.
This war was supposed to last for the next forty years, with fighting on the ground by proxy armies, on battlegrounds from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had truly collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridge.
Nevertheless, these plans became obsolete overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international bilateral and multilateral treaties.
The use of ships to transport goods is the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
Tradition has it that the role of naval forces is to ensure your country's ability to transport its people and goods, while at the same time, intercepting your enemy's ability to transport his people and goods.
One of the recent examples worth noting is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II, where the Americans tried to transport personnel and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to assist Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to counter this invasion, and its weapon for this was the use of submarines.
If the allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to invade Britain as it did with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time around 10,000 years ago in the Iranian Zagros mountains.
The ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them because access to milk, hair, meat, and skins was easy.
Domestic goats were generally raised in herds that roamed the hills or secondary grazing areas, often tended by goat herders who were usually children or teenagers, in the same manner as the widely known shepherd. These herding methods are still in use today.
The cart roads in England were established as far back as the sixteenth century.
Although the old railway carts were made only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them to achieve greater speeds and carry heavier loads compared to the roads that were considered more than rough at that time.
They invented railway bars a little early to stabilize the tracks, but it later became clear over time that placing an iron strip on top of the track makes it more effective.
That has become a common practice, except that the metal made the wooden wheels of the carts wear out more.
In the end, they replaced the wooden wheels with iron wheels. In 1767, the first complete iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the first means of transportation; humans began to walk upright two million years ago, coinciding with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not consistently walk upright.
Species with two feet were found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus might have walked on two feet seven million years ago.
We can start living in a way that is more in harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering a little bit.
This is exactly like treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, we must know the root of the problems, and we must end them.
It is sufficiently clear that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, and the problems have become greater due to the population increase and the luxurious lifestyle as a human right.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, they sent a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press.
At night, they copied between 150 and 200 copies, now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
They sent one of them to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy of it reached London on August 10.
The twenty-five Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the American Declaration of Independence document, but the original handwritten version is no longer available.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
It has feet with outer protective layers and claws, lays eggs, and walks on its hind legs like a leonWilsor.
Virtually all computers used today rely on processing information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, which are 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary numbers - or bits, if we use the conventional computer language.
Internal poisoning symptoms may not appear immediately, and a quick diagnosis cannot be made upon the appearance of symptoms such as vomiting, which are generally common enough.
The best indicator of internal poisoning might be the presence of an open container of treatments or toxic household chemicals.
Read the label so you can learn about the first aid instructions for the specified poison.
Entomologists use the term "bugs" in its official sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term is derived from ancient knowledge of bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both the "assassin bug" and "bed bug" are characterized by a long incubation period and adapt to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among young people and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that the likelihood of females developing multiple sclerosis is twice as high as that of males.
A couple might decide that it is not in their best interest or their child's best interest to raise an infant.
These couples might choose to set up an adoption plan for their children.
As part of the adoption process, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can care for the child.
The main goal of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method. This method in fact guides most scientific research.
Although it is not unique in this regard, experimentation and testing is a method that can be used to examine the validity of one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, particularly on the Bible in Latin.
They accepted Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology.
While knowledge declined among the Greeks, the West found itself isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often critically depend on the presence of self-sustaining cycles and their production through biological clocks.
They documented the rhythmic cycles, which are not just responses to external periodic signals, for most living organisms, including those specific to bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-oscillators that continue for periods of successive cycles even in the absence of external influences.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to label either the nucleic acid of the phages using radioactive phosphorus or their protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations may have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are from the germ line cells.
Mutations in germline cells can only be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including wildlife plant and animal life.
Examples of activities that can be done at the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting gardens, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing, and learning information about this type of monkey (orangutans) in Borneo.
People leave small towns in their cars every morning to go to their workplaces, and on the way, they meet others coming to work in the places they just left.
In this vibrant mode of transportation, everyone supports and somewhat connects to a transport system based on private cars.
Scientific evidence now indicates that this massive carbon-based economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transportation systems. Everyone complains about the transportation systems.
Rarely do you hear in developed countries similar levels of complaints about the quality of water or bridges that collapse.
Why do transportation systems generate complaints like these, and why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers not competent? Or is there something more fundamental happening?
Traffic movement is the study of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and the interactions they engage in with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic movement is difficult because it is not possible to predict driver behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable range of consistency; thus, traffic enjoys reasonable consistency and can be approximately expressed mathematically.
To better illustrate the flow of traffic, they worked on the relationships among the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape from enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are distinguished by their ability to fold their wings backward along the length of their bodies.
This grants them a larger set of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that cannot fold their wings today are the dragonfly and the mayfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some saw that he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
That seems logical, because you don't feel the earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. It carries eight times more water than the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, reaching a width of up to 6 miles at times.
20% of the water that rivers of the planet pour into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
"Despite the continued construction of stone pyramids until the end of the Old Kingdom of Egypt, the pyramids at Giza remain unparalleled in terms of size and artistic distinction in construction."
The ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom were astonished by the monuments of their ancestors, which had lasted for more than a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and has the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses the Italian language for its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of daily life used by most government workers, while Latin is usually used in religious ceremonies.
All the residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the existence of basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all these elements can be discovered in nature in their original form and can be extracted somewhat easily using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle hypothesized that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, even though he also assumed that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered minerals. And of course, there are minerals like silver and gold as well.
You can also obtain alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them can occupy the space of the period at the end of this sentence.
And then, the pencil became a good friend to many people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing tools, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and fewer uses.
People now write messages on computer screens without needing to use the scraper.
One can't help but wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The cluster bomb works on the basis that it gathers energy to form a nucleus filled with protons and neutrons.
Like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. The core splits again and a part of that energy is released.
Some atoms contain unstable nuclei, which means they tend to disintegrate with little or no movement.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust reaches about 70 kilometers on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
It is thinner under Maria and thicker under the heights.
There may be more lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to surface.
Content theories revolve around finding what excites or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that manifest themselves upon reaching adulthood.
These theories investigate what makes some people want to do the things they do and the aspects in their surrounding environment that cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors may emerge when managers start leading people of the same age: one is trying to remain "like the others."
This type of manager faces difficulty in making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary actions, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the opposite side, the individual turns into someone unrecognizable, feeling that he/she must change everything the team was doing and take ownership of it.
In the end, the leader is primarily responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often leads to disputes between the leaders and the rest of the team members.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Usually, virtual team members act as a point of contact for their immediate physical groups.
Usually, they have more independence than members of traditional teams, as their teams may meet according to different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real "hidden team" was described by (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) as a unique component of a virtual team.
Each member submits their reports to the management team, "the invisible team," where "the invisible team" sets the standards for each member.
Why would any organization desire to establish an educational organization in a time-consuming process? Innovation is considered one of the goals of applying institutional learning concepts.
When all available resources are utilized effectively across the functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can be achieved.
Because of that, collaboration within the organization to overcome obstacles can lead to the development of new innovative processes that meet the client's needs.
Before the organization is able to innovate, the leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuity method as a technique used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neuroscience-related data provide tangible evidence for the theoretical approach in investigating knowledge, thereby narrowing the research area and making it much more precise.
The correlation between the study of brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore the structures and processes of the brain in ways we did not know before.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Despite the fact that artificial intelligence has strong connotations with science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
The research in artificial intelligence involves creating machines to automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnostics and inquiries, in addition to handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate fields focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is now used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as for developing several software applications on home computers and video games.
Field trips are considered a big part of any classroom. Often, the teacher may want to take her students to places where taking a bus is considered impossible.
The technology provides the solution through virtual field visits. Students can watch artifacts at the museum, visit the aquarium, or enjoy fine art while sitting with their classmates in the classroom.
Also, sharing a virtual field trip is a nice way to remember a specific trip and exchange experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital, and the website is redesigned each year, but older versions are kept online to serve as a record.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students usually start their blogging experience with imperfect grammar and spelling, having an audience generally changes that.
Since the students are the most critical audience most of the time, the blogger starts to improve the writing in order to avoid criticism.
The need to feed public interest inspires students to be skillful and helpful (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can "enable students to become more analytical and critical; by effectively responding to online materials, students can determine their positions in the context of others' writings in addition to identifying their own opinions on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the enchanting bilingual capital of Canada, featuring a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
You will find Niagara Falls in the south, and to the north, there is a country with natural beauty that no one has exploited in Moscow and beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as the thing that is considered quintessentially Canadian to outsiders.
The large areas in the north are somewhat sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited.
In order to compare the populations that astonish many: the number of African Americans residing in the United States is greater than the number of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island by far, and it is a continent of its own when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent countries or associated with France, and are known as luxurious coastal resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the country, and it spread significantly in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the fifteenth century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the African coast, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Regardless of their actual marital status, women travelers should declare that they are married.
Wearing a ring is better (but not the one that looks very expensive).
Women need to know that cultural differences may lead to what they might consider harassment, and that it's common to stalk them, grab them by the hand, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stick to your stance (cultural differences don't make it acceptable!).
The Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids used the modern city of Casablanca as a strategic port called "Anfa" after its founding by Berber fishermen in the tenth century BC.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as "Casa Branca," but they abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Badia, and the Spanish traders called it Casablanca, where they established trading posts.
Casablanca is considered one of the least exciting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Finding places that sell traditional Moroccan goods throughout the old city is easy, like pots, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and all kinds of cheap goods, but all of this is intended for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from Mount Nyiragongo, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Any visits outside "Goma" are necessary to investigate in order to understand the situation of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu Province, while "Goma" is reasonably safe.
The city is also considered a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking routes in Africa.
You can take a boda boda (which is a motorcycle taxi) to get around the city of Goma, and the usual local price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Alongside being a bit difficult to reach, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for distant, exotic lands.
Timbuktu is currently considered a poor city, despite its reputation which made it a tourist attraction, in addition to having an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stations for Henry Louis Gates in his PBS series about the wonders of the African world.
The city differs strongly from the rest of the country's cities because it has a more Arab character than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, stretching along the Mozambique border to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and is bordered by the Crocodile River to the south.
The area of the park reaches 19,500 square kilometers, and it is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is considered one of the attractive areas in South Africa, and also a major park among the national parks in South Africa (South Africa's National Parks).
There is a daily fee to maintain and enter the park, like all national parks in South Africa.
It's better for you to buy a Wild Card, as it allows you to access a selected group of South African parks or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the name of the Hong Kong region its due, and it is the place that many tourists consider their destination.
The lined-up buildings that draw the Hong Kong skyline resemble a sparkling graph appearing above the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonizers made their own, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is considered the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending for 80 kilometers (50 miles) along the remote coastal areas of Bangladesh and India.
They declared Sundarbans as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just swamps for mangrove trees; they contain some of the last remaining evidence of the dense jungles that once covered the Ganges river plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 square kilometers, about one-third of which is covered by water/swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave the intercity station (across the river) throughout the day, although most of them, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because the buses that run between the neighborhoods are usually full, it's better to buy the tickets in advance a few days earlier.
Most areas are served by small, comfortable, and powerful Japanese "Coaster" buses.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The height of the two towers reaches 83 meters, its length is 378 meters, and it has two lanes each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, and it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is supposed to start operating at full capacity in September 2017, at the same time the completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoints is expected.
The "Guarani" were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now known as Eastern Paraguay; they lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to a second group of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting animals, gathering plants, and fishing.
In the sixteenth century, Paraguay, which was formerly known as "the Giant Province of the Indies," emerged as a result of a confrontation between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonial era that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competitions of the year are held in December at the polo fields in Las Canitas.
In addition, smaller tournaments and matches can be watched here at different times of the year.
To get news about tournaments and where to buy polo match tickets, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged to the value of the British pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island located in Stanley on the other side of the FIC West store.
They generally accept the British pound everywhere on the islands and with Stanley credit cards, and the US dollar often.
In the remote islands, there is a possibility that they do not accept credit cards, although they might accept British and American currency; check with the owners beforehand to know the accepted payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so it is necessary to exchange the money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer there occurs when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical regions; it is common for temperatures to exceed 30 degrees Celsius in the summer months.
The winter may be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer shows.
The amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year, as there are no specific "rainy" or "dry" seasons.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wildlife is ultimately wild, and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, sit at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may appear, bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost all large animals may attack.
Many guests get injured every year because they don't sit far enough away, and these animals are big, wild, and dangerous, so they need to have their own special area.
In addition to that, be cautious because scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking foods with strong odors and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa is the city of Apia. This city is located on the island of Upolu, and its population is just under 40,000 people.
Abyei was established in the 1850s and became the official capital of Samoa in 1959.
The port was the site of infamous naval confrontations in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships sank except for one British cruiser. About 200 American and German people drowned.
During the struggle organized by the Mao movement for independence, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the death of the Supreme Leader Tobua Tamasis Liloafe III.
Due to "Auckland" being located between two harbors, there are many beaches there, with the most popular ones located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy, making swimming safe, and most are shaded by the buttock trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These family beaches are sometimes crowded with a good assortment of shops lining the shore. Swimming is safe.
The basic popular beer is known as "Number One," as it is not a complex drink but rather an enjoyable and refreshing beverage. The second local beer is called "Manta."
There are many types of French wine, but New Zealand and Australian wine might spread more.
The tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is strange. The little black coffee is "espresso," while the cappuccino has a layer of cream on top (not foam), and they serve tea without milk.
The hot chocolate complies with Belgian standards. The fruit juices are excellent although their price is extremely high.
They do a lot of trips to the coral reefs throughout the year, and injuries to the coral reefs rarely occur for any of these reasons.
However, seek advice from the authorities, adhere to all signs, and pay full attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish can be found near the beaches and river mouths from October to April north of 1770, and it can sometimes be found outside of these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and when they see them, they run away.
Saltwater crocodiles usually live in the ocean; their primary habitat is located in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
A confirmed reservation reassures the traveler that they will have a place to sleep when they reach their intended destination.
Even though you can book other forms of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agent, travel agents often have deals with specific hotels.
Travel agents have become accustomed to offering packages that include breakfast and transportation arrangements to and from the airport, or even bundled packages that include flights and hotels.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (for example, the visa).
Despite that, any changes or requests must be directed through the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of attendees at music festivals decide to camp on-site and consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to get close to the events, you have to arrive early to secure a camping spot near the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages may have ended, there are sections of the festival that may continue playing music until late at night.
Some festivals include special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the Northern Baltic Sea area in winter, you must check the cabin's location, as passing through the ice causes a very loud noise for those most affected.
Saint Petersburg cruise tours include some time walking around the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually make a lot of efforts to increase the time and money guests spend. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and it may be difficult to find exits.
They usually have special meals, drinks, and entertainment shows to keep the guests in a good mood and keep them in the building.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks, but intoxication hinders proper judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober-minded.
Anyone driving their car at high altitudes or over mountain passes must be aware of the possibility of snowfall, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you can't drive as if you were driving on smooth asphalt.
During snowstorms, an amount of snow may fall that is enough to stop you for a very short time.
Snowfall, icy winds, condensation, or ice on car windows may cause limited visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are considered normal in many countries, and traffic generally continues without interruption throughout the year.
Safari tours may be the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most famous for many visitors.

Most fatalities occur from the exhaustion of trying to swim against the current, which might be impossible.
Once you swim out of the current, swimming back is not as easy as usual.
Try to target a place where the current doesn't dominate you again, or, depending on your skills and whether anyone noticed your presence, waiting for rescue might be a second option.
