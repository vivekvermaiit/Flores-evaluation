There is only one remaining planned creation of a new type of dinosaur, according to an ancient theory, but it reveals those details that cannot be determined from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the color of this bird is chestnut-brown on top and somewhat yellowish on its underparts.
