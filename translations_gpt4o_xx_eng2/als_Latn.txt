This confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already known, but provides details that cannot usually be obtained from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional presentation.
According to scientists, on the upper part this animal had feathers of chestnut brown color and, on the lower part, feathers with a pale or carotenoid color.
This discovery also gives us an idea about the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed central shaft, called "rachis," but share other characteristics with the structure of modern feathers, like spines and barbs, researchers concluded that the rachis could be a later evolutionary development than these features.
The structure of the feathers makes you think that they were not used for flight, but rather for regulating temperature or for display. Researchers believe that the specimen shows an adult feather, not a bird's down, although this is the tail of a small dinosaur.
The researchers were of the opinion that, although this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult feather and not a small bird's downy feather.

Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of the star which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the value of the Rossby number (Ro), the less active the star is in reversing the polarity of its magnetic field.

The completed work was mostly theoretical even though the program was designed to simulate observations conducted on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for might be caused by tidal forces between dark matter in the galaxy and dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational force on the Earth and causes tides, so too does the Milky Way exert force on the constellation of Sagittarius.
Scientists concluded that dark matter has an impact on other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a halo form and consists of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
He expressed in an interview that the new variant was "very concerning and alarming due to the very high mortality rate".
Some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, - thinks Dr. Molli, - and at least two were healthcare workers at the hospital.

The government has also promised several million vials of the anti-encephalitis vaccine, which will help health agencies prepare for the coming year.
Plans for distributing vaccines in historically hardest-hit areas were delayed this year, due to a lack of funding and because they were given less priority compared to other diseases.

Voting in France has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and insert a pre-printed paper sheet into an envelope indicating their chosen candidate.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.

Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can ensure there are no envelopes in them before voting begins, and that no envelopes are added except for those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives as witnesses to any part of the process. Votes are counted in the evening by volunteers under strict supervision, following the appropriate procedures.

The Director of Public Prosecutions, Kier Starmer QC, made a statement this morning saying that Huhne and Pryce were charged.
MP Huhne has resigned and will be replaced in the cabinet by MP Ed Davey. MP Norman Lamb is expected to take on the role of Minister of Trade, which will be vacated by Davey.
Huhne and Pryce are scheduled to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16.
The victims were Zachary Cuddeback, 21 years old, and Nicholas Alden, 25 years old. Cuddeback had been the driver of the car.
Edgar Veguilla was wounded in the arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider suffered injuries that required surgery to reconstruct his face.
Uka's gun jammed when he pointed it at the fifth person's head. Schneider has ongoing pain, is blinded in one eye, is missing part of his skull, and his face has been reconstructed with titanium.
Shneider testified via a video link from a U.S. military base in his homeland.
In addition to Wednesday's event, Carpanedo also competed in two individual races in the championship.
Her first was the slalom, where she got "Did Not Finish" on her first attempt. 36 out of 116 competitors achieved the same result in that race.
In her next race, the giant slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's seated group, with a combined walking time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place finisher, Austria's Klaudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place finisher, Hungary's Gyöngyi Dani.
Four skiers in the women's sitting skiing category did not finish their race, and 45 out of 117 skiers in total in the Alpine Skiing World Championship failed to qualify in the race.
The police in Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen laptop and cell phone.
The deputy inspector general, D K Arya, said: "We have arrested the five people who raped the Swiss national and have recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Buta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused arrived in court with covered faces.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red "Audi TT."
He was initially admitted to the "James Paget" hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoja has been accused of killing her son in the first instance court of Edinburgh.
She is in custody awaiting arraignment and the commencement of the trial, but any eyewitness testimony may be tainted because her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice operates differently, and the courts have deemed the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial to the case.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee emphasizes that "it seems journalists are treading a dangerous path if they publish the photographs, etc., of suspected individuals."
The Prosecutor's Office, which is responsible for all criminal prosecutions, has told reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment is announced.
According to the information, the document will refer to the opposition of the borders, which Palestine wants according to the pre-Middle East War boundaries of 1967.
It is believed that other topics covered include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel, until the signing of this agreement, seeks to have a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years, while the Palestinian authorities agree to allow their presence for only five years.
The shooters had to be closely supervised by the guards during the additional pest control trial, as the trial was monitored and assessed for its effectiveness.
In a partnership between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia, qualified volunteers were recruited under the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters' Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, deputy director for Park Protection and Heritage in NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation have been given extensive instructions for their safety and training.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in before a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is the fifth Interim Electoral Council for Martel in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to lead the country towards new elections.
Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October was the commission.
The protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by the non-occurrence of elections, some of which have been expected since 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating iPods that malfunctioned have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) stated that it was informed about 27 accidents related to the equipment.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry announced last week that "Apple" had informed it about 34 other overheating incidents, which the company called "unserious."
The Ministry reacted by describing the postponement of the report by Apple as "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 p.m. local time (Friday at 09:19 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time).
The Northern Mariana Islands' Emergency Management Office stated that no damage had been reported on site.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle in the direction of the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released first, as were the Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of an elderly woman after she had to go to the bathroom. They mistakenly shot her.
Liginsi followed his father's example and began a career in medicine.
He was educated as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital, Liginsi began to research premature birth in his free time.
His research showed that, if a hormone is administered, it would speed up the lung maturation of the fetus in babies.
"Xinhua" reported that state investigators found two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Lunës was also honored by her wrestling colleagues.
Tomi Drimer said: "Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night with two moons. Quite rare, like herself. A strong woman."
Dastin "Goldast" Ranels commented: "Luna was so weird as I... maybe even more... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she's in a better place".
In a survey of 1,400 people prior to the 2010 federal elections, opponents of Australia returning to a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the campaign for the 2010 federal elections that she believed the state of Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the people in the survey share this opinion, according to which they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
In the extreme responses to the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist had to swim in the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition has not been certain.
He has not been able to get the right medications to overcome his pain, as they are banned by the Games.
Kurtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
The discovery was verified by many people using different devices and software in early February, and this was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets have been a source of delivering water to Earth, along with organic materials that can create proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand the formation of planets, especially how Earth was created from comet collisions long ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriages.
He called the rumors "political nonsense and foolishness".
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to FAA's claims, will allow planes to move on shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
He uses satellite technology, compared to the old technology based on ground-based radars, to allow air traffic controllers to locate the aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transport means will be provided, and the overground trains will not stop at "Wembley," and the car parking facilities, as well as park and ride, are not available to the playing field.
The fear of lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the creation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and at Uppsala University in Sweden announced that new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process took longer, due to crossbreeding between Darwin's endemic finch, Geospiza fortis, and the incoming cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be laminated into thin forms.
It can be drawn and made into a thin wire, which can then be twisted and woven. It can be hammered into a sheet or laminated.
He can be thinned excessively and combined with other metals. He could be thinned so much that it was sometimes used for decorating hand-painted images in books called "Illuminated Manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can prepare an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidic or basic (alkaline) level of the chemical.
The pH level is evidenced by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the analyzed chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which the electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one electron and one proton).
Mix the two dry powders and then, with wet and clean hands, squeeze them to form a ball.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layers, which will give a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every dwelling, connected to a quite complex sewage system.
In the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, remnants of sewage systems have been found.
Toilets existed also in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. Toilets, in Roman civilization, were sometimes part of mixed public baths for men and women.
When you make a phone call with someone thousands of miles away from you, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then sends it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by means of a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
To place a satellite or telescope in space, a giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel has brought us is that it has provided a much faster and much easier way of transportation.
She has brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Below them are cats larger than average that feed on prey of average size, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
In conclusion, there are many small cats (including house cats that roam freely) that eat many more small animals like insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a cozy corner, a special function that every cat has which doesn't allow it to compete with others.
Lions are the most social felines. They live in large groups called prides.
Herds consist of one to three closely related adult males, along with up to thirty females and young.
Women, being part of a large family of sisters and daughters, generally have closer bonds with each other.
Lion prides behave like packs of wolves or dogs, animals with behavior that surprisingly resembles that of lions (but not of other big cats) and are also very deadly to their prey.
As a quite prepared athlete, a tiger can climb (although not so well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with the strength of five strong people.
The tiger is in a group (genus panther) with lions, leopards, and jaguars. These are the only four cats that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but it is more like a sentence with words of growls and screams.
Ocelots like to feed on small animals. When they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller in size than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find their prey through scent, by smelling where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision and move very stealthily as well. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with the surrounding environment and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originated (such as if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they go to a new island and thus cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than a previously necessary competitor.
The original population has not changed at all; it still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it starts to look less and less similar to the other population.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is a very important part and an inevitable consequence of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people inhale and absorb the carbon dioxide that people exhale (meaning, that they exhale through breathing).
Plants produce their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses with plants and make our clothes with plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
The Mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, therefore it feared nothing except other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws were filled with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set on the palate, which meant that nothing in his path could escape him.
We do not know for sure, but he might have had a tongue like a fork. His diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and he might have even been a cannibal.
He attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex could not defeat him.
Although we would recognize most of their foods, the Romans had quite a few strange or unusual items for feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference was that, while poor people and women ate their food seated on chairs, rich men preferred to eat together at banquets, where they would consume their meals reclining on couches.
The meals of the ancient Romans could not have included foods that came from America or Asia to Europe in later centuries.
They, for example, had neither corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and even no ancient Roman has ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple called the house of the lord.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to attend to the needs of the gods through celebrations and festivals.
Every temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes as an integral part of temples, special towers in the shape of pyramids, called ziggurats, were built.
The peak of the tower was a special shrine for the god.
The apartment didn't matter as much in the warm climate of the Middle East.
Life in the Jewish family mainly took place in the open air.
The women cooked the meals in the courtyard; the shops were simply open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood materials were extremely expensive.
Greenland had few settlements. In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, in his journeys westward, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, the Eskimo tribes already lived there during that period despite his discovery.
Although each state was "Scandinavian," among the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, there were many differences.
If you have seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think that a treasure map was written behind the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Behind the Declaration of Independence was written "The original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of this document, written upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
For this reason, it is possible that the note was placed only as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent fighting had liberated northern France, but the south was still occupied.
He was governed by the French of the Vichy regime. They were French who, in 1940, had chosen to make peace with the Germans and had collaborated with the occupiers, instead of fighting against them.
The Allies invaded Southern France on August 15, 1940, and the invasion was named "Operation Dragoon."
Within two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated Southern France and were advancing towards Germany.
A civilization is called a distinct and common culture of a rather large group of people who live and work in collaboration, a society.
The word "civilization" originates from the Latin word "civilis" which means "civil", which is connected to the Latin word "civis" meaning "citizen" and "civitas" meaning "city" or "city-state", which in a way also defines the size of the society.
City-states are the precursors of states. A civilizing culture implies the transmission of knowledge across several generations, a continuous cultural trace, and a fair dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, the thirteen colonies first created a weak central government - with Congress as its only structure - according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, since there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
Additionally, he had no authority to violate the laws on taxes and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous approval of all the states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so unseriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, just like the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and, in 2006, they were the FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, starting with Italians competing in both international games and Olympic activities.
Japan consists of almost 7,000 islands (with the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the grouping/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, geographically, as an "archipelago".
The origins of Taiwan began long ago, in the 15th century, when European sailors who passed by recorded the island's name as "Ilha Formosa" or "beautiful island".
The Dutch East India Company established a base in Southwestern Taiwan in 1624, initiating a transformation of local grain production practices and employing Chinese workers in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the coastal areas in the west and north of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which it ceded the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which controlled it until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main structures, namely: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of how they originally looked.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976 and the restoration continues even today.
For example, the most common format of still photography in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant size of film at the end of the analog film era.
It continues to be produced even today and, above all, in the same format inherited from the image sensor of a digital camera.
The 35 mm format is, in fact, somewhat confusing, 36 mm in width by 24 mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio with whole numbers) results in 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS family of formats) are the same or very similar to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, often abused and frequently mocked, is a simple guiding line that creates dynamism by maintaining a degree of order in an image.
He determines that the most effective place for the main subject is the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become powerful and wealthy, was viewed with a scrutinizing eye.
For over a thousand years, the Christian faith had bound the European states to one another, despite differences in language and customs.
His power, felt everywhere, touched everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the main dogmas of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's funds are there specifically for that reason.
The main organs of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether this principle was being implemented.
Immediately after the start of military hostilities, Britain initiated the naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy was proven effective, disrupting vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law, which had been codified through several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent the entry of all ships into entire parts of the ocean, even putting neutral ships at risk.
Since the response to this tactic was minimal, Germany hoped for a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
The predominant attitudes of the majority of citizens and nations during the 1920s were pacifism and isolation.
After the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, nations wanted to avoid the repetition of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the "Edison" company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with only 4 cents in his account, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of marking different periods of time; each era of China or each ruling family was known as a dynasty.
Similarly, between each of the dynasties, there was an unstable period with separate provinces. The most well-known period among them was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce war broke out among many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
"The Three Kingdoms" was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, in which thousands of people died in the struggle to occupy the highest position in the grand palace in Xian.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, as well as the belief that the country belongs to the people, and not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, job positions were also opened for all male applicants, enabling success for the most ambitious and successful ones.
This applies to the army as well, because instead of military ranks being based on categories, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class peoples in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was most interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He often went to meditate in a cave that began to be known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Nur" (light).
The cave itself that survived the ages gives a very vivid reflection of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
This cave, which is located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy at all to find it, even if you know it exists. Once you enter the cave, you are completely isolated.
You can't see anything else except the clear and beautiful sky above and the numerous mountains surrounding you. From inside the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that continues to stand today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures constructed in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt has several pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Khufu), several small tombs, some temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upper arc" symbol looks like a V, and the "lower arc" symbol looks like a staple or a square without the bottom edge.
"Upper" means you should start at the top and push the bow, and "lower" means you should start at the ring (which is where the hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
The upper bow generally produces a sweeter sound, whereas the lower bow is stronger and more firm.
You can keep your notes, but remember that the printed arched signs are there for musical purposes, so they usually should be respected.
King Louis XVI, terrified, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Lady Elisabeth, on October 6, 1789, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and yelling threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage fully open.
In an instant, a member of the crowd shook the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The costs of the American imperialist war to occupy the Philippines were paid by the Filipino population itself.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover a significant portion of the expenses, and the interest on the bonds was traded on the stock exchange in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Certainly, the super-profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main profits of American imperialism.
Someone must understand the circumstances that prompted the creation of the order in order to understand the Templars.
The era when the events took place is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (years 1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a variety of ideas in practice, from technological impetus or necessity to the narrow understanding that human fate is guided by a basic logic related to the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two main ideas: that the development of technology follows its own path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, on the other hand, has "impacts" on societies that are natural, unconditioned by social factors.
Someone might say, for example, that the vehicle necessarily leads to the improvement of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a small number of vehicles, therefore new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass ownership of vehicles also leads to a higher percentage of road accidents, which results in the invention of new techniques in healthcare for repairing injured bodies.
Romanticism had a pronounced element of cultural determinism, brought by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and over time customs and cultures emerged tied to that geography, and, since they were in harmony with the place of society, they were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is renowned as the fashion capital of today's world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital in feudal Europe.
His fame as the epicenter of luxury began around the 400s AD and lasted until around the 1100s AD.
His position declined during the twelfth century, especially due to the fact that the crusaders had returned bringing gifts such as silks and spices, which were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
At this time, the transfer of the title of fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris was also completed.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At the beginning, the attire was greatly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the east.
However, as a result of slow communication channels, Western styles may remain 25 to 30 years behind.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time that came as a result of the crusades was that people started to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Existential agriculture is the type of agriculture practiced to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Existential agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses native seeds combined through crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques for maximum yield growth.
Historically, the majority of farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, and the situation continues to remain the same in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel marginalized by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the ethnicity, age, location, class, and/or gender of the members.
Distinctive criteria of a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender-based, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often show their affiliation by using style in a unique and symbolic way, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common ways used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to rely on some unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, disasters, or intentional abuse, have not been socialized with adults during their upbringing.
These children are called "wild" or primitive. Some wild children have been isolated by people (usually by their parents); this abandonment of the child was in some cases due to the parents' non-acceptance of the child's severe intellectual or physical disorder.
Wild children may have been victims of severe child abuse or trauma before abandonment or separation.
It is said that some were raised by animals and for some it is said that they lived alone in nature.
When completely raised by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely identical to that of the particular caretaker animal, such as his fear or indifference towards people.
While the project-based learning method should make learning easier and more interesting, supported learning "Scaffolding" takes it a step further.
The scaffolding teaching method is not a learning method, but rather, it is an auxiliary tool that provides support to individuals who are undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new software program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, meaning a teacher is a kind of scaffold, but so is the little person in the form of a paperclip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated by the software and aim to investigate, stimulate, and explain procedures that the student may have found difficult to handle alone.
Children are sent to the orphanage for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse, and even extortion.
No child should be raised, in any case, in an environment that is not encouraging, kind, and educational, but they are being raised this way.
We consider the Guardianship System as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system is expected to provide loving guardians, safe homes, secure healthcare, and continuous education.
Guardianship is supposed to provide all the missing needs at the home where they were previously.
The internet combines elements of mass communication as well as interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to other dimensions regarding access for uses and pleasures.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are proposed as important incentives for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects related to motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they observed how the audience reacted to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries in explaining micro-expressions and facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that one can detect if a person is lying through the accurate interpretation of their facial expressions.
In his statement "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks showed how people who are unable to understand the speech due to brain damage are nonetheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He was even of the opinion that such abilities to explain human behavior might also belong to animals, such as domestic dogs.
20th-century studies have proven that there are two groups of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variant and selection removes it from the group of expressed variants.
Isolation and recombination repeatedly mix variation between the two groups with each generation.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans finds it difficult to meet its amino acid needs through plant sources from the savannah.
Furthermore, the failure to achieve this has serious consequences: reduced growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The plant sources that are more easily accessible would be proteins obtained from leaves and legumes, but primates like us have difficulty digesting them unless they are cooked.
On the other hand, foods derived from animals (ants, termites, eggs) not only digest easily, but provide large amounts of proteins that contain all the necessary amino acids.
Considering all things, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved "their protein problem" somewhat in the way that chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
The interruption of sleep is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using an alarm clock with a relatively low volume to bring you to your senses without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while sleeping, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you're forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed to force someone to wake up to urinate.
The level of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the level of tension in their body and spirit.
With the reduction of tension, the current vital force increases. Every individual has the opportunity to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was further enriched with the theological thought of the Mahayana's "path of love" and more Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
Through Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The Tibetan meditation center is divine yoga. Through the visual presentation of some deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and enlightenment consciousness is created.
Germany was the common enemy in World War II, bringing about cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, clashes of systems, processes, and cultures led to the conflict between the states.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies and thus the Cold War began.
She would continue for the next 40 years and would truly be fought by authorized armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and in many other countries.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken and the only hope was withdrawal and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
Nevertheless, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the invasion of the Eastern Polish regions, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Agression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for transporting goods is currently the most efficient way to move large quantities of goods and people across the ocean.
The traditional duty of naval fleets has been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time, hindering the enemies' ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most important recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans were attempting to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
Simultaneously, the German fleet was trying to stop the traffic mainly using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have managed to invade Britain, just as had happened with the other countries of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Cultures and ancient tribes began to keep them to easily obtain milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed on hills or other pastures, often under the care of goatherds who were usually children or teenagers, somewhat similar to the more commonly known shepherds. These methods of livestock keeping are still used today.
The roads for wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carts consisted only of parallel wooden boards, they allowed horses to pull them to achieve higher speeds and to haul larger loads than on the slightly more difficult roads of that time.
The sleepers were put in place quite early to hold the rails in place. However, it was gradually understood that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron plate on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron wore out the wooden wheels of the wagons more.
In the end, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first entirely iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of transport was walking; people started walking on foot two million years ago when Homo Erectus (which means upright man) appeared.
Their ancestors, the australopithecus, did not usually walk on two legs.
Adaptations for bipedal walking have been found in australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although sahelanthropus may have walked on two feet as far back as seven million years ago.
We can begin to live by respecting the environment more, we can participate in the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to somewhat reduce future suffering.
In many cases, this is akin to treating the symptoms. However, we need to find the cause of the problems and deactivate it if we don’t want just a temporary solution.
It is very clear that the world has undergone great changes due to human advancements in science and technology, and problems have increased due to overpopulation and humanity's extravagant way of living.
After its approval on July 4 by the Congress, a handwritten draft signed by the President of the Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing shop.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were made that are now known as "The Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made on July 8 by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that are known to exist so far are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The first handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not see them as dinosaurs, as they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things regarding birds that are similar to dinosaurs.
They have clawed feet and scales, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex dinosaur.
Almost all computers in use today rely on the manipulation of information, which is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and, in computer language, these numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning might not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are quite general for an immediate diagnosis to be made.
The presence of an open box of medications or toxic household chemicals may be the clearest sign of intoxication.
Examine the label for special instructions regarding first aid for that specific poison.
For this group of insects, entomologists use the term beetle in its official sense.
This term originates from the long-standing similarity to bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Like assassin insects, bed bugs are also nidicolous, adapted to living in the nest or shelter of their host.
In all the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), thus remaining the most significant neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have found that the chances of women having multiple sclerosis are twice as high as for men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child.
These couples may decide to prepare an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their rights as parents so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main purpose of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most scientific research.
But that is not the only one; scientific study is also guided by experimentation and the experiment is the test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, by asking questions and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, particularly, the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted in every scientific matter, including psychological ones.
When the knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself disconnected from the Greek roots of philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms related to physiology and behavior often depend primarily on the presence of endogenous cycles as well as their production by biological clocks.
For the majority of living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, periodic rhythms have been documented that are not merely a response to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators that will continue a period of free-running cycles, even in the absence of external signals.
The experiment by Hershey and Chase was one of the main proposals that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used viruses, or phages, to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled the bacteriophage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can lead to a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ line cells.
Only mutations of germline cells can be transmitted to children, whereas mutations in other locations may cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in going to natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of outdoor activities include fishing, hunting, photography, bird watching, park visits, and studying information related to the ecosystem.
An example is the development of tours, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the towns by car to go to their workplace, and other people pass by them, whose work destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic ebb and flow movement of transportation vehicles, everyone is somehow connected and supports a transport system that relies on private cars.
Now science shows that the massive carbon-based economy has caused the displacement of the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is a participant in society and uses the transport systems. Almost everyone has complaints about the transport systems.
In developed countries, complaints about the quality of water or collapsing bridges are rarely heard.
Why do transportation systems cause these grievances, why do they fail every day? Are the transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more significant happening?
The movement of traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to operate within a steady time interval; therefore, traffic flows can be calculated mathematically with approximation.
To better present the flow of traffic, connections have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This coordination helps in the planning, design, and use of road facilities.
In animals, insects were the first to take to the air. The ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mate more efficiently.
The majority of insects have the advantage that they can fold their wings back along the length of their body.
This gives them a larger number of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects today that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a person named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many others believed the opposite; that the solar system, including the Sun (and even other stars), moved around the Earth.
This seems logical, because the Earth doesn't appear to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second-longest river on Earth and the widest. It carries 8 times more water than the river ranked second.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with a width of six miles in some cases.
About 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river, the Amazon, is 6387 km (3980 miles). It collects the water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the construction of the Pyramids of Giza were never surpassed.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors which were at that time much older than a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the state with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language used every day by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have had knowledge since antiquity of such fundamental chemical elements as gold, silver, and copper, as all of these can be found in nature in their original form and extracted relatively easily from mines with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, developed the theory that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. Those elements were earth, air, water, and fire.
This resembled more the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also developed the theory that they transform into new substances to create whatever we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. There are, without a doubt, also metals like silver and gold.
You can also obtain alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of small particles, which are called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them can fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
In this way, with his invention, the pencil became a good companion for many people.
Unfortunately, after the emergence of newer writing methods, the status and uses of the pencil have declined.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever needing to use a sharpener.
Someone can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes out.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that the fusion of several protons and neutrons with a nucleus requires energy.
Like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Splitting the nucleus from the front releases a portion of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they have a tendency to split spontaneously or with even the slightest provocation.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the visible side and 100 km thick on the far side of the moon.
She is thinner under the dark maria regions and thicker under the mountainous regions.
There may be more seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. The lava had an easier time rising to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what makes people choose or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires, which they keep within as they reach adulthood.
These theories analyze what makes some people desire the things they desire and which things in their environment will motivate them to do or not do certain things.
Two widespread theories about content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when managers start leading their former colleagues. One side of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unusual decisions, impose disciplinary measures, conduct performance evaluations, assign tasks and responsibilities to everyone.
On the other side of the spectrum, such a person easily turns into someone who is not recognized, who thinks that he or she must change everything the team has done and take ownership of it.
Ultimately, the leader bears the ultimate responsibility for the success and failure of the team.
Often, this behavior causes divisions between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are expected to meet the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are some small differences.
Members of the virtual team often function as the point of contact for their direct physical group.
They often have more independence than traditional team members, as their teams can meet across different time zones, which may not be understood by their local administration.
A unique component of a virtual team is also the presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
"The Invisible Team" is the management team to which every member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for every member.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of creating an educational organization? One objective of implementing concepts of organizational learning is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used across the functional sectors of an organization, creativity and capability can emerge.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a renewing process to serve the client's needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum method as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. Consequently, they narrow the field of research and make it much more precise.
The reciprocal relationship between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their studies.
It has long been known that different types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material for building simulation models, which help us understand the processes of our mind.
Although artificial intelligence (AI) has taken on strong nuances in science fiction literature, artificial intelligence constitutes a very important branch of computer science, which deals with the intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation of a machine.
Research in AI includes the creation of devices for the automation of tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice, and face.
These things have transformed into distinct disciplines, which focus on providing solutions for real-life problems.
The Artificial Intelligence system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, since it is included in several software applications of personal computers and video games.
Excursions occupy a large part of any teaching methodology. It often happens that a teacher expresses the desire to send her students to places where one cannot go by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual field trips. Students can visit museum artifacts, view an aquarium, or admire fine arts, while sitting with their class.
The virtual field trip is also an excellent way to think about a journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of "Bennet" school in North Carolina create a website dedicated to their trip to the capital, this website is modified each year, but the old versions are still preserved online as a memory block.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. While students often start their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins efforts to improve writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to engage the audience's interests inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their knowledge beyond their traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. Through active responses to online materials, students can establish their positions concerning writings from others, as well as determine their viewpoints regarding specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the attractive bilingual capital of Canada which has a series of art galleries and museums showcasing the past and present of Canada.
Farther south is Niagara Falls and the north shelters the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these and many others present Ontario with elements considered by foreigners as the most typically Canadian.
Large areas that are located further north are very sparsely populated, and some of them are almost deserted and uninhabited regions.
For a comparison of the population that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, along the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island and a separate continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are known as luxurious beach holiday destinations.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it had a great impact on the Comoros and Mayotte islands.
The influence and colonization by Europe began in the 15th century, after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It helps you even if you wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences may cause what they consider harassment and following, grabbing by the arm, etc. is not uncommon.
Be firm when rejecting men and do not be afraid to stand your ground (even if it happens due to cultural changes, it does not mean it is okay!).
The contemporary city of Casablanca was founded by Imaghzen fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it, naming it Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru-I-Badia, and it was named Casablanca by the Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as tajines, ceramic items, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of ornaments, but everything is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the eastern edge near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Niragongo volcano that covered most of the city's roads and especially the city center.
Although Goma is somewhat safe, you should investigate any visit outside of Goma to understand the situation of the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo along with some of the lowest-cost mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorbike taxi) to move around Goma. The typical local fare is approximately 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
In combination with its erstwhile unattainability, "Timbuktu" is now used as a metaphor for faraway exotic places.
Timbuktu today is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
She was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger in 1990, due to the threat from desert sands.
She was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' special broadcast for the Public Broadcasting Service "Wonders of the African World".
The city contrasts sharply with the other cities in this country, because it has more of an Arab style than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) stretches in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, with Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which is home to various wild animals.
He is one of the most important attractions of South Africa and is called the flagship of South Africa's national parks (SANParks).
Like all National Parks in Southern Africa, the park has daily entrance and conservation fees.
You may also benefit from purchasing a "Wild Card," which offers entry to each of South Africa's selected parks or to all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place considered as the main destination by many tourists.
The parade of buildings forming the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a shimmering bar chart highlighted by the presence of the waters of the "Victoria" harbor.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon pier opposite.
The majority of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the land appropriated by British colonizers, so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is the appropriate place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into the Bengal and Indian coastal area.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The forest in the Indian part is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just mangrove swamps; they include some of the last remaining parts of the great jungles that once covered the northern Indian valley.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², approximately one third of which is covered with water surfaces/swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a sanctuary for wildlife and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal royal tigers in the area and around 30,000 deer have also been encountered.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those traveling east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
It is advisable to buy the ticket a few days in advance, as it often happens that intercity buses are fully booked.
The majority of the regions are served by small Japanese "Coaster" buses, which are comfortable and powerful.
Taking taxis together is a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as to Paro (Nu 150) and to Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It stretches over the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction finished in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced agriculture for survival.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who made their living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, which was previously called the "Giant Province of the Indies," was established as a result of the confrontation between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spaniards were the ones who initiated the period of colonization, a period that continued for three centuries.
Since the establishment of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its indigenous identity and character.
Argentina is well-known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the whole world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can be seen here at other times of the year as well.
For the news about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, go to the Argentina Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which is set equivalent to that of a British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted everywhere on the islands and, within Stanley, credit cards and American dollars are often accepted as well.
In the peripheral islands, credit cards are likely not to be accepted, although British and United States currency may be accepted. Consult in advance with the owners to determine what payment method is accepted.
Outside of the islands, it is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency, so change your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zones. In the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can have a deceptive cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what is colder than the temperature indicated by the thermometer.
There is no particular "rainy" and "dry" season: the level of rainfall is approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park administration, you should stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
Despite how docile they may seem, bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack you.
Every year dozens of visitors get injured because they do not keep the proper distance. These are wild, large animals and they may be dangerous, and for this reason, you should give them the necessary space.
Additionally, keep in mind that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid storing or cooking fragrant foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia, founded in the 1850s, has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval collision in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships sank, except for one British cruiser. Approximately 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence efforts organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the killing of the main leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches due to Auckland's location between two harbors. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches in North Shore (in the North Harbor district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches and safe for swimming and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of "Tamaki" Road are in the Waitemata Harbour, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches sometimes overcrowded with people with a plethora of shops lined up near the shore. You can swim safely.
The main beer in the country is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but it is refreshing and pleasant. The other local beer is named "Manta".
There are many French wines to enjoy, but New Zealand and Australian wines can be found more easily.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easily available if you are concerned.
For Australians, the idea of a "simply white" coffee is something foreign. A short black coffee is "espresso", cappuccino is served covered in cream (and not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but wonderful.
Throughout the year many trips are made to the reef and damage to the reef from any of these causes is rare.
But again, respect the advice of the authorities, respect all the signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths from October to April, north of the Gulf 1770. Occasionally, they may also appear outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean. Their main habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advanced booking ensures that the traveler rests assured that there will be a place to sleep as soon as they arrive at their destination.
Often, travel agents have deals with specific hotels, although you may find that it is possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to secure other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must initially go through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the overwhelming majority of participants at music festivals choose to set up camps in the same place, and most of the participants consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the activity, you will need to go early to find a camping spot near the music.
Don't forget that, even if the music may have ended on the main stages, there might be sections of the festival that will continue to play music until the late hours of the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the Northern Baltic during winter, check where your cabin is, as movement on the ice causes a very dreadful noise for those who are more sensitive.
Cruises in Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos typically make many efforts to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Usually, windows and clocks are absent and exits can be found with difficulty.
They usually have special offers for food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and on their premises.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks. But being drunk impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who will be driving at high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider that there may be snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is small and you cannot drive the vehicle as if you were on clean asphalt.
During snowstorms, in a very short time, so much snow can fall that you might get stuck.
Viewership can also be limited by snowfall or snowstorms, or by condensation or ice on the windows of the transport vehicle.
On the other hand, weather conditions with ice and snow are common in many places and traffic generally continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the main attraction element of tourism in Africa and the most special moment for many visitors.

Stirrups are foot supports for the rider that hang down on each side of the saddle.
They ensure better stability for the rider, but they can be a safety issue due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If the rider is thrown off the horse but his foot is stuck in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, some safety precautions can be taken.
First, the majority of motorcyclists wear boots with heels and very narrow, smooth soles.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety straps that allow the stirrup leather to fall from the saddle if pulled back by the falling rider.

Under good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than by walking, but you will very rarely reach skiing speeds on terrain without a heavy backpack on groomed tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but has many independent states. Under normal conditions, traveling to many states would require visa applications to be conducted and numerous passport checks.
Nevertheless, the Schengen area functions somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as you don't leave this area, you can usually cross the borders without having to go through passport control points again.
In the same way, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa in each Schengen member country, thus saving time, money, and documents.
There is no general definition of which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define as antiques goods that are older than 100 years.

The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest one is King George Island with the settlement of Vila-Las-Estrelas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the water-filled caldera of a still-active volcano offers an impressive natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula converge here on the plateau and then reappear to form a 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which are separated by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak, Mount Vinson, at 4892 m.

Generally, for enrollment in these educational programs, a tuition fee will be required.
Finland is a very good destination for boating. "The land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht on these lakes and archipelagos.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaking offer a different experience.
Boat trips are considered a national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but, apart from them, it is something quite unique (e.g., in the Netherlands, this figure is one in forty).
Most special cruises in the Baltic have an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for several full days, while returning to sleep on the ship at night.
If you go to the shore only with boat excursions, you will not need a special visa (since 2009).
Some cruises in their brochures present the German city of Berlin. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not at all near the sea, thus a visit to this city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying on an airplane can be a frightening experience for people of any age and background, especially if they have not flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.

If they were to send things by air transport, for some itineraries it could take several days to go through the unloading and customs clearance process.
The only way to get them through faster would be to send them as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow sending baggage without passengers, and here is your role.
The easiest way to fly in first or business class is to gather a large sum of money for this privilege (or, even better, have the company do it for you).
However, this does not come cheap: as a general rough rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy rate for business and eleven times more for first class!
Usually, it is not even worth asking for a price reduction for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain handful of passengers who willingly pay high prices to have the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they set the prices accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
