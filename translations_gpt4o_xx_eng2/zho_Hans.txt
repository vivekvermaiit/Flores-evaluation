This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers—a theory that has already been widely circulated—but also provides details that fossils usually cannot offer, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the tips of this animal's feathers are chestnut brown, with the underside being lighter or carrot-colored.
This discovery also helps deepen the understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
The feathers of dinosaurs did not have a well-developed main shaft—called the "rachis"—but they still had other features of feathers, such as barbs and barbules, leading researchers to infer that the evolution of the rachis may have occurred later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight, but for temperature regulation or display. Researchers believe that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage rather than juvenile feathers.
Researchers believe that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers rather than the down of a hatchling.

Current senator and Argentine First Lady Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced her presidential candidacy last night in the city of La Plata, which is 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires.
Ms. Kirchner announced her intention to run for president at the Grand Theater of Argentina, where she also began her senatorial campaign as a representative of the province of Buenos Aires in 2005.
The debate began due to controversies over relief and reconstruction spending after Hurricane Katrina; some fiscal conservatives humorously referred to it as "Bush's New (Orleans) Deal."
Liberal criticism of the reconstruction efforts mainly focuses on the practice of awarding reconstruction contracts to those viewed as Washington insiders.

Most of the completed work is theoretical, but the purpose of writing the program is to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team is looking for may be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists can conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
The theory suggests that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is in some kind of halo around the galaxy, composed of many small particles.
The TV report shows white smoke coming out of the factory.
The local government warned residents near the nuclear power plant to stay indoors, turn off the air conditioning, and not drink tap water.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered this extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa.
In an interview, he stated that this new variant is "very disturbing and concerning because its fatality rate is extremely high."
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have contracted bacteria in the hospital, and at least two of the patients are hospital medical staff.
Within a year, one infected person may infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the proportion of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis among the entire tuberculosis patient population still seems to be low; in South Africa, at any given time, only 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people are infected.

The infrared images show that the temperature changes between day and night indicate these locations are likely caves.
Compared to the surrounding surfaces, they are cooler during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as the large caves on Earth, which usually maintain a fairly constant temperature, but they are very similar to the conditions in deep underground pits," said Glen Cushing of the USGS Astrogeology team in Flagstaff, Arizona, and Northern Arizona University.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters enter a small booth and place a pre-printed slip of paper indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting register.
The French electoral law has established quite strict regulations for the election process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes in the box at the beginning of the voting, and that no one else has placed envelopes in the box except those eligible voters who have been timely registered.
Candidates may send representatives to observe every stage of the election process on-site. In the evening, volunteers count the votes according to a specific procedure under strict supervision.

Huhne has resigned, and his position in the cabinet will be taken over by MP Ed Davey. It is expected that MP Norman Lamb will replace Davey as the Secretary of State for Business.
Hu Na and Price will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16.
The victims are 25-year-old Nicholas Alden and 21-year-old Zachary Cuddeback. Cuddeback was driving at the time.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and chin, while Kristoffer Schneider required facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon malfunctioned when it was pointed at the fifth person's head. Schneider was in unbearable pain, blind in one eye, and missing a piece of skull, with his face rebuilt using a titanium plate.
Schneider testified via video link at a USAF base in his homeland.
In addition to Wednesday's match, Carpanedo also participated in two individual events of the championship.
Her first event was slalom skiing, and she finished the first round with a "Did Not Finish" result. Among the 116 participants in the competition, 36 achieved the same result.
Her other race was the giant slalom, where she finished tenth in the women's standing category with a total time of 4:41.30 minutes, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place Austrian athlete Claudia Lösch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place Hungarian athlete Dáni Gyöngyi.
In the women's sitting category, four skiers did not finish the race, and 45 out of 117 competitors in the giant slalom event did not make it onto the leaderboard.
The central state police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested 5 people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants were all masked when they appeared in court.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, no one was injured in the end.
However, the driver's head was severely injured.
The road where the accident occurred is temporarily closed, and emergency rescuers have rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
At first, he was sent to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth for treatment.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Thereafter, Adjekayak was charged with murdering her son and was tried at the Edinburgh Magistrates' Court.
She has been detained awaiting prosecution and trial; however, the evidence of any witnesses may be adversely affected as her image has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scotland's legal system is different, and the court believes that publishing the photos could potentially cause harm.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee pointed out: "It does seem harmful if journalists publish information such as photos of suspects."
The Crown Prosecution Service, the main department responsible for prosecution, told reporters that no further comments will be made at least until the prosecution is initiated.
According to reports, the document will mention the border dispute, and the Palestinians hope to use the borders before the 1967 Middle East war as a basis.
According to reports, other topics discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands the deployment of military forces in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian National Authority only agrees to a retention period of five years.
The rangers will closely monitor the shooters participating in the pest control supplementary test, as the test will be monitored and its effectiveness will be evaluated.
In collaboration with the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) recruited qualified volunteers for the hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of the Conservation and Heritage Management Branch at New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), stated: The four shooters selected to participate in the first shooting operation have all received comprehensive safety and training guidance.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in as part of the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of 9 members.
This is Martelly's fifth selection to the Haitian Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) in four years.
Last month, the President's Committee recommended the resignation of the former CEO as part of measures to push the country towards new elections.
The committee is Martelly's response to the large-scale anti-government protests that began in October.
Since 2011, some of these protests have been triggered by elections not being held as scheduled, and sometimes the protests escalate into violent incidents.
According to reports, about 60 iPods have malfunctioned and overheated, causing a total of 6 fires and slightly injuring 4 people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan stated that they have noted 27 incidents related to the equipment.
Last week, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple reported 34 more incidents of overheating to the department, although the company stated that these incidents were "not serious."
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry responded that Apple's delay in releasing the report is "very regrettable."
An earthquake occurred in the Mariana Islands at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The Office of Emergency Management in Northern Mariana Islands stated that there were no reported domestic disaster losses.
Moreover, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that no signs of a tsunami were detected.
A former police officer in the Philippines hijacked a tourist bus in the capital, Manila, taking the Hong Kong tourists onboard as hostages.
Rolando Mendoza raised his M16 rifle and fired at the tourists.
Multiple hostages have been rescued, and at least six hostages have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages (including children and elderly people) and those Filipino photographers were released early.
Two photographers later replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza, on the other hand, was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began his career as a doctor.
He received obstetrician training and began working at National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Liggins began researching premature birth in his spare time while working at the hospital.
His research indicates that administering hormones can accelerate the maturation of a baby's fetal lungs.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators found two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also mourned Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first supreme queen, my first manager. Luna passed away on a night of the twin moons. Such a night was as special as she was. She was a strong woman."
Dustin Runnels, nicknamed "Goldust," commented: "Luna is as elusive as I am... she might be even harder to figure out... I love her and will miss her... I hope she has gone to a better place."
A survey was conducted on 1,400 respondents before the 2010 federal election, and the number of respondents opposing Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II steps down.
34% of respondents unanimously stated that they hope Queen Elizabeth II will be the last monarch of Australia.
The poll shows a polarized situation, with 29% of respondents believing that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his health has been in question.
He has been unable to alleviate the pain with medication, because the competition prohibits participants from taking these drugs.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
In early February, several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may be the source of water and organic matter on Earth, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets, especially Earth, have formed since comets collided with Earth long ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo has been serving as governor since the beginning of this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "political prattle and foolish behavior."
He is presumed to run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) claims that the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) can shorten flight routes for airplanes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of outdated ground radar technology, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There are no additional transportation services, and the overground trains do not stop at Wembley, nor are there car parks and park-and-ride facilities above ground.
Due to concerns about a lack of transportation, the match may be forced to take place behind closed doors without any supporters of the teams.
On Thursday, a study published in the journal "Science" reported that a new species of bird has formed in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that due to breeding between the native Geospiza fortis and the introduced Geospiza conirostris, this new species evolved in just two generations, despite the belief that this process would take much longer.
Gold can be processed into various shapes. It can be curled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into fine threads for winding and braiding. It can also be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and stuck to other metals, and because it becomes so thin, it is sometimes used to decorate the illustrations in books known as "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH value of a chemical substance. You can use red cabbage juice to make an indicator.
The color of cabbage juice will change according to the acidity or alkalinity of the chemicals.
The pH value is expressed by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being measured.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost an electron (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Stir the two types of dry powder to mix them, then use clean wet hands to knead them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, forming something like a shell, which feels very interesting.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro each had almost every household equipped with flush toilets connected to an advanced sewage treatment system.
Traces of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths that were co-ed.
When you make a phone call to someone thousands of miles away, you'll use a satellite.
After receiving the call, the satellite in space almost immediately reflected it back.
The satellite is launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere causes distortion of certain light and vision.
To send a satellite or telescope into space, a giant rocket over 100 feet tall is required.
The wheel has changed the world in unimaginable ways. Its greatest contribution to us is making our transportation more convenient.
With it, we have trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits and antelope to deer.
Ultimately, many small felines (including free-range pet cats) feed on much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the niche concept, with each cat responsible for a specific task, preventing them from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social of all big cats, living in large groups called prides.
A pride of lions consists of one to three related adult males, and up to thirty females and cubs.
As sisters and daughters in a large family, females are generally closely related to each other.
The behavior of lion prides is very similar to that of wolf packs or dog packs. These animals' behavior is remarkably similar to that of lions (but different from other large cats), and this behavior is also very lethal to their prey.
The tiger is an all-around athlete; it can climb (although its climbing ability isn't very strong), swim, and jump long distances, with pulling strength five times that of a human strongman.
The tiger, lion, leopard, and jaguar belong to the same type (genus Panthera). These four big cats are the only felids capable of roaring.
A tiger's roar is not as deep as a lion's roar, but more like an angry hiss.
Leopard cats like to eat small animals. If conditions allow, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all of the leopard cat's prey is much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey by scent and sniffing the trails of animals on the ground.
Their night vision is excellent; they can see clearly in the dark and move very stealthily. Leopard cats hunt by first blending into their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from their original main population (for example, they cross mountains and rivers, or they reach a new island so that it's not easy to return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to become a strong competitor, rather than those they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all; they still need to adapt to the environment as before.
As time goes by, the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, and they start to become increasingly dissimilar to other populations.
After thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will eventually look so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We refer to this process as "speciation," which is the formation of new species. Speciation is the inevitable result of evolution and also a crucial part of evolution.
Plants can produce the oxygen humans inhale and absorb the carbon dioxide humans exhale.
Plants obtain nutrients from sunlight through photosynthesis. They can also provide shade.
We use plants to build houses and make clothes. Most of the food we eat is from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, and it feared nothing except its kind.
Its long lower jaw is filled with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, and there is also a row on the upper jaw. This means that anything that encounters it has no chance of escape.
Its tongue might be forked; we are not yet certain about this. Its diet includes sea turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it might even eat humans.
It will attack anything that enters the water; even giant dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex are no match for it.
Although most of the Romans' food is common to us, they did have some strange or unusual banquet dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference is that the poor and women sit on chairs to eat, while the rich prefer to gather together for a banquet and recline while eating.
Foods introduced to Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later could not have appeared in the diet of the ancient Romans.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Romans had ever eaten turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their deities and regarded it as the dwelling place of that god.
People present offerings to the gods, and priests fulfill the needs of the gods through rituals and celebrations.
Every temple has an outer courtyard open to the public, and an inner sanctuary that only priests can enter.
Some special towers are pyramid-shaped and are called pyramid-shaped sacred towers, built as part of temples.
The top of the tower is a special sacred place of God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses are not that important.
The life of a Hebrew family is mostly spent outdoors.
Women are cooking in the courtyard; the shop is actually an open counter facing the street. They use stones to build houses.
Canaan does not have large forests, so timber is very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. According to the Norse saga, Eric the Red was exiled from Iceland for committing murder; he sailed west, discovered the land, and named it Greenland.
But regardless of whether he discovered it or not, the Eskimos were already living there at that time.
Although all belong to "Scandinavia," there are many differences among the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think there is a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, the truth is not like that. Although something is written on the back of this document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the "Declaration of Independence" has the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776" written on it. The text is written at the bottom of the document, and it is upside down.
Although no one can be certain who the author is, this large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) is said to have been stored rolled up when it was first written.
Therefore, it is likely that this symbol was only added as a label.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated Northern France, but the South was still not liberated.
It was governed by the "Vichy" French. These French reached a peace agreement with the Germans in 1940, did not resist the invaders, but cooperated with them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, a campaign known as "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the American and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a singular culture shared by a group of people (society) living together and working cooperatively.
The term "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis" (meaning "of a citizen"), and is related to the Latin "civis" (meaning "citizen") and "civitas" (meaning "city" or "city-state"), which in some way also defines the scale of society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilization-type culture implies the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, the lasting presence of cultural footprints, and the fair spread of culture.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any historical evidence and are not considered respectable civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation (with Congress as its only component).
Congress does not have the power to levy taxes, and because there are no national executive or judicial branches, Congress can only rely on state governments to implement all laws, and state governments often do not cooperate.
"It also does not have the authority to overturn tax laws and tariffs between states."
These clauses must receive unanimous consent from all states to be amended, and the states' attitude towards the central government is so dismissive that their state representatives frequently absent themselves.
The Italy national football team and the Germany national football team are both the second most successful teams in the world, having won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island country in the world!
Due to the large number of islands, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geological perspective.
The Western understanding of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors named the island "Ilha Formosa," meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern region of Taiwan, began altering the indigenous people's methods of food production, and employed Chinese workers on their rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644 - 1912) troops took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, the Qing Empire declared the establishment of a province in Taiwan.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled Taiwan until 1945.
The ancient city of Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana (Hitching Post of the Sun), the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
In order to allow visitors to better understand the original appearance of the architectural complex, most of the buildings at the edge of the complex have been rebuilt.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work has continued to this day.
For example, the most common format for static images in the world is the 35mm format, which was the dominant movie size at the end of the film era.
To this day, it is still in production, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been applied to the format of digital camera image sensors.
The actual size of the 35mm format is 36mm wide and 24mm high, which makes the format somewhat confusing.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by 12 to get the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format series) have the same or very similar aspect ratio.
The often abused and ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating dynamics while keeping images organized.
It points out that the most effective positions for the subject are the intersections of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was under close scrutiny.
Despite the different languages and customs of European countries, Christianity has united them for more than a thousand years.
From kings to commoners, its pervasive power affects everyone.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's monetary funds are specifically established for this purpose.
The centralization of the church in Rome had existed for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether they were adhering to the doctrine.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, Britain began to impose a naval blockade on Germany.
They cut off critical military and civilian supplies. It proved to be an effective strategy, despite such a blockade violating universally accepted international law established over the past two centuries under several international agreements.
The UK laid mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire sea area, even posing a threat to neutral countries' vessels.
Because of the limited response to this strategy, Germany expects its unrestricted submarine warfare to receive a similar response.
In the 1920s, the mainstream attitude of most citizens was pacifist and isolationist.
After witnessing the devastation and brutality of World War I, countries were eager to avoid repeating the same mistakes.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and took a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
When he arrived in the United States, he had 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison written by Charles Batchelor (the manager of his previous job).
Different periods of ancient China each had their own characteristics; each era or ruling family in China represented a distinctly unique dynasty.
Similarly, during the transitions between various dynasties, there was a period of instability with small states being divided. The most famous of these is the 60-year-long Three Kingdoms period, which occurred between the transitions of the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these turbulent times, various feudal lords engaged in fierce wars to vie for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history. Tens of thousands of people died fighting for supreme power over the luxurious palaces of Xi'an.
There are many social and political impacts, such as the use of measurement units, the transition from autocracy to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country does not belong to the sole ruler but to the people.
In addition, after the revolution, official positions were open for application to all men, giving the most ambitious and successful individuals the opportunity to rise to prominence.
The military is the same, as rank is no longer based on hierarchy, but rather on talent.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class in many other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters beyond earthly life. He often went to a cave called "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself not only withstood the test of time and was preserved, but also brought an extremely vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual intentions.
The cave is located on the top of a mountain north of Mecca, completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, even knowing about its existence, it's not easy to find. Once you enter the cave, you are completely isolated from the world.
All you can see are the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains. In the cave, you can hardly see or hear anything from the outside world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid is a masterpiece of the Egyptians from the third century BC, and it is one of many large pyramids built to honor the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau in Egypt's Valley of the Dead (also known as the "Giza Pyramid Complex") includes several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, some temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed in memory of Khufu's wife and family members.
The "upward bow" symbol is like the letter V, and the "downward bow" symbol is like a staple or a square missing the bottom side.
Upward refers to starting to push the bow from the top, while downward refers to starting to pull the bow from the bow root (which is the place where you hold the bow).
The up-bow usually produces a softer sound, while the down-bow produces a stronger, more resolute sound.
Please feel free to make your own marks with a pencil, but remember that the printed notes have musical significance, so they should usually be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis Charles), along with the king's sister Madame Élisabeth, were driven back to Paris from Versailles by a group of market women.
They returned to Paris by carriage, surrounded by a crowd who threatened the king and queen with shouts and cries.
The mob forced the king and queen to completely open the carriage windows.
In front of the terrified queen, a mobster once waved the head of a royal guard, who was killed at the Palace of Versailles.
The war expenses of American imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the expenses and the interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the high profits gained from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people became the fundamental gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the background that led to the establishment of the Knights Templar.
The era in which the events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages of European history, specifically the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The period before the High Middle Ages is the Early Middle Ages, and the period after is the Late Middle Ages, with the convention being that the Late Middle Ages ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses many ideas in practice, including technological drive theory, technological necessity theory, and a strict definition—the fate of humanity is driven by the underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism include these two general ideas: first, the development of technology itself largely transcends cultural or political influences, and second, technology, in turn, exerts an inherent "influence" on society that is not constrained by social conditions.
For example, someone might say that cars will inevitably promote the development of roads.
However, establishing a national road network for only a few cars is not economically feasible, so new production methods emerged to reduce the cost of car ownership.
A high ownership rate of Volkswagen cars can also lead to a higher incidence of road traffic accidents, which will promote the invention of new medical technologies for treating the injured.
Romanticism has a strong cultural determinism color. This stems from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes individuals, and over time, customs and cultures related to geography emerge, which, being in harmony with the place where society is situated, are far superior to any imposed laws.
Just as Paris is called the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the 12th century, mainly because the gifts brought back by the Crusaders, such as silk and spices, were more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine market.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak from the 10th to the 14th century.
At first, dresses were deeply influenced by the culture of Eastern Byzantium.
However, due to slow cultural exchange, Western fashion may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
As the Middle Ages drew to a close, the people of Western Europe gradually developed their own style. One of the greatest advancements at that time was that after the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is an agricultural activity conducted to produce only enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple and often organic system that utilizes locally preserved seeds within the ecological zone, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence farming. This is still the case in many developing countries today.
Subculture unites like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by societal norms and fosters a sense of identity among them.
Given differences in age, race, class, location, and/or gender among members, subcultures may be distinctively characterized.
The qualities that make a subculture unique may be a combination of language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography, or multiple factors.
Members of subcultural groups often symbolically use distinctive styles of behavior to signify their membership, including fashionable clothing, manners, and jargon.
To illustrate the importance of socialization, one of the most commonly used methods is to employ cases of a few unfortunate children. These children, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, did not achieve socialization with the help of adults during their growth process.
Such children are called "feral children," meaning wild children. Some feral children are confined by people (often their own parents); in some cases, children are abandoned because their parents refuse to accept that they have serious intellectual or physical disabilities.
The wild child may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
It is said that some people were raised by animals; some lived alone in the wild.
If a feral child is entirely raised by non-human animals, its behavior (within the limits of its physical capabilities) will be very similar to that of the animal, such as showing fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a means to assist people who are new to using a computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding teaching can be conducted online or offline, in other words, the teacher is a form of scaffolding teaching, just like the paperclip assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is internalized in the software to question, prompt, and explain programs that may be difficult for students to handle independently.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment without upbringing, care, or education, but things often go contrary to one's wishes.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable medical care.
The foster care system should provide all the necessities that the original family lacks.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the internet add additional dimensions to its uses and ways of satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "communication" are considered important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
When studying the audience's response to the website, Eighmey and McCord (1998) also considered "personal involvement" and "continued relationship" as new motivational factors.
The use of video has brought significant discoveries to the interpretation of micro-expressions (facial movements lasting a few milliseconds).
Specifically, it is said that one can determine if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay "The President's Speech," pointed out that those who are unable to understand language due to brain damage can still accurately judge whether a speaker is sincere.
He even suggested that this ability to understand human behavior might be a common skill among animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variations: dominant and recessive.
Mutations add new genetic variations, while selection removes variations from the pool of expressed genetic variations.
Due to separation and recombination, variations move back and forth between the two pools in each generation.
In the tropical savanna, primates have a digestive system similar to that of humans, and the existing plant resources can hardly meet the amino acid needs of primates.
Moreover, failing to do so will result in serious consequences: growth inhibition, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant-based resources should be proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, it's difficult to digest such proteins unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest but also provide a large amount of protein and contain all the essential amino acids.
In conclusion, we should not be surprised if the way our ancestors addressed the "protein problem" is no different from the method used by chimpanzees on the tropical savannas today.
Sleep interruption refers to the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep and falling asleep again after a short period (10-60 minutes).
It's easy to do, using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without being fully disturbed.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm clock while sleeping, you can place the alarm clock on the other side of the room to force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other choices based on biorhythms include drinking a large amount of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, which are known to have diuretic effects) and forcing oneself to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace in a person is inversely related to the level of physical and mental tension.
The less pressure there is, the more positively vitality is expressed. Everyone can find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can reach the state of enlightenment, and the only obstacle to achieving it is our own tension and negative emotions.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha but has been expanded through the universal love of Mahayana Buddhism and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes methods of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visual imagery.
The core activity of Tibetan meditation is the Sky Yoga. By visualizing different deities, purifying energy channels, and activating chakras, one can reach the state of enlightenment.
Germany was the common enemy of all countries during World War II, which promoted cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the end of the war, conflicts in systems, procedures, and culture caused the two countries to part ways.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies had now become enemies, and the Cold War soon began.
The war lasted 40 years, with proxy armies engaging in real combat on many battlefields from Africa to Asia, including in Afghanistan and Cuba.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defenses had been breached, and the only remaining hope was to retreat and reorganize the army along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were almost overnight discarded as worthless, and after violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties by invading the eastern regions of Poland, more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops entered the territory and entrenched themselves in Belarus and Ukraine.
So far, shipping is the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, the mission of the navy is to ensure the nation's ability to transport personnel and goods while disrupting the enemy's ability to transport their personnel and goods.
One of the most notable modern examples is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. The Americans attempted to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily consisting of U-boats, attempted to intercept the transport.
If the Allies had been defeated at that time, Germany would likely have conquered the UK just as it did other European countries.
Goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to domesticate them, consuming and using their milk, meat, wool, and skins.
Domestic goats are usually grazed in herds on mountains or other grazing areas, typically looked after by goatherds (mostly children or teenagers), similar to the more well-known shepherds. These grazing methods are still in use today.
As early as the 16th century, England had already built carriageways.
Although the tramway cars were merely made of parallel planks, at that time, considering the slightly uneven roads, these cars allowed the horses pulling them to run faster and carry more.
The introduction of sleepers to secure the tracks happened very early on, but people gradually realized that placing iron plates on the tracks made them more stable and effective.
This has become a common practice, but the metal strips cause the wooden wagon wheels to wear out more severely.
Ultimately, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron track was introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking. Two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning upright man), humans began to walk upright.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
Bipedal adaptations were found in Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, join environmental movements, and even become environmental activists to some extent to reduce future disasters.
In many cases, this is very similar to symptomatic therapy. However, if we want more than just a temporary solution, then we should find the root cause of the problem and eradicate it completely.
It is evident that due to the advancement of human science and technology, the world has undergone significant changes, and the problem is exacerbated by overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyles of humans.
The handwritten draft signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4th, after which it was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop a few blocks away for printing.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies were printed, which are now known as the "Dunlap broadsides."
On July 8, John Nixon publicly read the document for the first time in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One of the letters was sent to George Washington on July 6, and Washington read this letter to his army in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
There are 25 remaining Dunlap broadsides, which are the earliest surviving versions of the document. The handwritten original has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and continue to exist today, which we refer to as "birds."
Many people think they are not dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds still have many similarities with dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Today, almost all computers in use are based on processing information encoded in binary.
A binary number can only take one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and such a number is called a binary digit, or a "bit" in computer terminology.
Poisoning within the body may not immediately show symptoms, and symptoms such as vomiting are very common, so a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The strongest indicator of ingestion of a toxin might be an opened container at the scene containing drugs or household toxic chemicals.
Check the label on the poison for specific first aid instructions.
Entomologists use the term "bug" to formally refer to this category of insects.
This term originates from people's familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects that are highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Assassin bugs and stink bugs are both nest-dwelling insects, adapted to living in the nests or dwellings of their hosts.
In various regions of the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a major neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system (composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves).
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis (MS).
A couple may decide not to have children for their own benefit or in consideration of their children's interests.
These couples may make adoption plans for their children.
During the adoption process, the biological parents terminate their parental rights, allowing another couple to raise the child.
The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works through scientific methods. In fact, this method can guide most scientific research.
An experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses; however, an experiment is not the only method. Asking questions and making observations can also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts, particularly the Latin version of the Bible.
The views expressed by Aristotle on issues in all fields of science (including psychology) were accepted one by one.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West had become detached from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Researchers have observed that many physiological and behavioral rhythms largely depend on endogenous cycles generated by the biological clock and their existence.
Cyclical rhythms are not merely a simple response to external periodic signals. Such rhythms have been recorded in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillating mechanism that continues to operate freely for a period of time even in the absence of external cues.
The experiment by Hershey and Chase is one of the main pieces of evidence indicating that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments: one involved labeling the bacteriophage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus, and the other involved labeling the bacteriophage's proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells will be inherited by children, while mutations in other cells can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts visitors who are interested in natural areas; they come to see natural landscapes, including wildlife.
The on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystems.
For example, visit, photograph, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of the small town to go to work, and the places where the people they pass on the road work are exactly where they left from.
In this dynamic flow of traffic, everyone is somehow connected to and supports the car-based transportation system.
Today, science shows that this large-scale carbon economy can no longer keep the biosphere, which has supported human evolutionary development for the past 2 million years, in a stable state.
Everyone is a member of society and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone has complaints about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you seldom hear complaints about the quality of water or bridge collapses at a similar level.
Why do the transportation systems cause such complaints? Why do they break down every day? Are the traffic engineers incompetent, or is there a more fundamental reason?
Traffic flow studies the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Regrettably, studying traffic flow is difficult because it is impossible to predict drivers' behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers often falls within a reasonable range of consistency; therefore, traffic flow tends to have a certain reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established among the following three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly makes it easier for them to evade predators and more effectively search for food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings back along their bodies.
This gives them more small areas to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people believe he is right, but there are also many who hold the opposite view; they believe that the solar system revolves around the Earth, and so does the Sun (and even other stars too).
That seems reasonable because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. Its water volume is more than eight times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with some sections reaching a width of 6 miles.
The Amazon River accounts for 20% of the outflow of all rivers in the world.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. The river is fed by thousands of smaller tributaries.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the grand scale and superior building techniques of the Giza pyramids were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were already over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and also the least populous.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legal regulations and official communications.
Italian is also the language commonly used in daily life by most people working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper because these elements can be found in nature in their natural forms and can be mined relatively easily with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that everything is composed of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (in no particular order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also proposed a theory that they would transform into new substances, forming the things we see.
An alloy is basically made by mixing two or more metals. Don't forget one thing, there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are metals, and naturally, elements like silver and gold are also metals.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements (such as carbon).
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that the period at the end of this sentence can accommodate trillions of them.
Therefore, as soon as pencils appeared, they became a favorite for many people.
Regrettably, with the emergence of new writing methods, the status of pencils is declining, and their use is decreasing.
People now write messages on computer screens and never have to use a pencil sharpener again.
People can only speculate about what the fate of the keyboard will be when updated products appear.
The working principle of a fission atomic bomb is as follows: it requires energy to bring a nucleus, along with many protons and neutrons, together.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy cart up the hill. Split the atomic nucleus again, then release some energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they are likely to undergo fission with little or no prompting.
The surface of the moon is composed of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 kilometers thick on the near side and about 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
The crust beneath the darker side is thinner, while the crust under the highlands is thicker.
Because the crust is thinner, the nearer side may have more dark areas, and lava can rise more easily to the surface.
The core of content motivation theory is to find factors that are recognized or generate interest.
These theories suggest that as people mature to a certain extent and enter adulthood, certain needs and/or desires become internalized.
These theories study why some people want to do what they do, and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when managers begin to lead their former colleagues, two behaviors tend to emerge. One situation is that they will strive to maintain a "close relationship" with team members.
Managers of this type find it difficult to make unpopular decisions and also face challenges in enforcing disciplinary measures, conducting performance evaluations, allocating responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
In another extreme situation, this person would become an individual vastly different from before, feeling that he/she must change everything the team has done and claim the results as their own.
After all, the leader bears the ultimate responsibility for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leader and other team members.
Virtual teams need to adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are also subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the point of contact for their corresponding offline teams.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams may schedule meetings across different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The existence of a truly "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" refers to the management team that every member reports to. It sets standards for all members.
Why does it take so long for an organization to build a learning organization? One of the goals of putting the concept of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
Creativity and originality occur when all available resources are effectively utilized among the functional departments of an organization.
Therefore, an organization often brings about new innovative processes to meet customer needs in the process of working together to overcome obstacles.
Before an organization can innovate, leaders must create a culture of innovation, share knowledge, and engage in organized learning.
"Angel" (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method that can help organizations reach higher performance levels.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for theoretical approaches to cognitive research. Therefore, it narrows the scope of research and makes the study more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior can support the research of scientists.
We have long known that different types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors can affect human behavior and lead to changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study the structure and functioning of the brain, which were never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and materials to build simulation models, helping us understand the processes of brain functioning.
Artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction flavor, but it is actually a very important branch of computer science, focusing on the study of machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
The research of artificial intelligence (AI) involves creating machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnostics and issues, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and facial features.
All of these have become independent disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and some home computer and video game software applications already have built-in artificial intelligence systems.
Field trips are an important part of any educational activity. Usually, teachers are happy to take students to places where buses cannot reach.
Virtual field trips are a high-tech solution. Students can view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire exquisite artworks in the classroom.
Sharing field trips virtually is also a good way to recap the journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but the old versions are saved online as a scrapbook.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing skills. Although students often have careless grammar and spelling when they start blogging, the appearance of readers usually changes this situation.
Students are often the most critical readers, so bloggers are starting to strive to improve their writing skills to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogging also "forces students to be more insightful about the world around them." To cater to the interests of their audience, students are inspired to become smart and interesting.
Blogging is a tool that can inspire collaboration and also encourage students to extend their learning beyond traditional school lessons.
"Appropriate use of blogs can make students better at analysis and critical thinking; by actively responding to online materials, students can find their own position within the context of others' articles and be able to present their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the capital of Canada, charming and bilingual, highlighted by a series of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, while to the north is the Muskoka River and the undeveloped natural beauty across the river.
All these factors make Ontario the typical image of Canada in the eyes of outsiders.
In the vast regions further north, human habitation is sparse, and some areas are deserted wilderness.
A set of startling population data comparison: The number of African Americans living in the United States is greater than the number of Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is currently the largest island, and for wildlife, it is still an independent continent.
The smaller islands are mostly independent countries or belong to France, and they are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this land, and this doctrine is prevalent in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence and colonialism of Europe began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
The north borders the Sahel region; the south and west are adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean.
Female: It is recommended that all female tourists say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring can also help (but don't wear a ring that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead to behavior they perceive as harassment; furthermore, situations like being followed or having their arms grabbed are not uncommon.
When rejecting a man, be firm and don't be afraid to stand your ground (regardless of cultural differences, firmly say no!).
The modern city of Casablanca was established by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids, formerly known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it, naming it Casablanca (Casa Branca), until it was abandoned after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya. Spanish traders established a trading post here and named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring shopping destinations in all of Morocco.
Shops selling tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and other Moroccan traditional items and various trinkets can be found everywhere near the old city of Medina, but these stores are all aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located at the easternmost part of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Mount Nyiragongo volcano. The volcanic lava buried most of the town's streets, especially the town center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, you should investigate in advance before traveling anywhere outside Goma to understand whether the ongoing fighting in North Kivu Province has eased.
This city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking projects in Africa.
You can take a boda-boda (rented motorcycle) to tour Goma. The normal (local) price for a short trip is 500 Congolese Francs.
Also because of its relative remoteness, "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor for a distant foreign place.
Today, although Timbuktu's reputation has made it a tourist destination and it has an airport, it is a poor town.
In 1990, due to the threat of the desert, it was listed as an endangered World Heritage site.
This is an important stop for Henry Louis Gates in the PBS special "Wonders of the African World."
This city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country because it is more Arabic in style rather than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, providing support for various wildlife and plants.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks) system.
Like all South African national parks, the park charges a conservation fee and entrance fee daily.
There are many benefits to buying a Wild Card. With this card, you can enter some parks or all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is synonymous with the Hong Kong area and is also the focal point in the minds of many tourists.
The numerous buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline resemble a glittering bar chart, standing out particularly against the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To best appreciate the beautiful scenery of Hong Kong, you can leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the reclaimed land on the northern shore.
This is a place occupied by British colonizers, so if you want to find evidence of the colonial history of this territory, this is a great starting point.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the coast into the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest within India is known as Sundarbans National Park.
However, these forests are not just mangrove swamps; they also contain remnants of huge jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
Sun De Berners has an area of 3,850 square kilometers, about one-third of which is water/wetland.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary. It is estimated that currently, there are 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer living in the area.
Buses run all day from the inter-city bus station (across the river), but most services, especially those going to the east and to Jakal/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
In view of the fact that the shuttle bus is often full, it is recommended to purchase tickets a few days in advance.
Most areas have access to comfortable and sturdy Japanese Coaster minibuses.
Taking a shared taxi is a fast and comfortable way to get to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River, connecting Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges in French Guiana.
The two bridge towers are 83 meters high, the length of the bridge is 378 meters, and there are two lanes each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The project was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, by which time the Brazilian customs checkpoint is also expected to be completed.
The Guaraní are the most important indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay; they led a semi-nomadic hunting life and also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to the Guaycuru and Payagua and other indigenous tribes, who live by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was known as the "Great Province of the Indians," a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and local indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began a colonial period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain many of the indigenous features and characteristics of the city.
Argentina is famous for having the world's top polo teams and players.
The largest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
On other days of the year, smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen here.
To learn about tournament news and how to purchase polo match tickets, please visit the Argentine Polo Association website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound, which is equivalent to the British pound.
Currency can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the island, and in Stanley, you can often pay with credit cards and US dollars as well.
On the outer islands, credit cards may not be accepted, but British and American currency can be used; please contact the homeowner in advance to confirm acceptable payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange it before leaving.
Montevideo is located south of the equator, so when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region; during the summer months, temperatures often exceed 30°C.
Winter can feel colder than it appears: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but when wind and humidity combine, it can feel colder than the temperature shown on the thermometer.
There are no specific "rainy seasons" and "dry seasons" here: the annual rainfall is roughly the same.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to humans, wild animals are ultimately wild animals, and we should not feed or disturb them.
Park management stated: Keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how gentle they may seem, bison, moose, elk, bears, and almost all large animals may attack humans.
Every year, dozens of tourists get injured for failing to maintain a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so please give them some space.
In addition, be aware that scents can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking odorous food and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Built in the 1850s, Apia has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the bay.
Except for a British cruiser, all other ships were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During a peaceful gathering in the town, organized as part of the Mau movement's struggle for independence, Paramount Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was killed.
Auckland spans two harbors, so there are many beaches locally. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (located within the North Harbour area) stretch along the Pacific Ocean from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost the entire area is beach, swimming is very safe, and most places are shaded by New Zealand Christmas trees.
Tamaki Drive beach is located on the Waitemata Harbour, right in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes crowded with vacationing families, lined with a variety of shops along the coast. Swimming is very safe.
The local main beer is "Number One" beer. It is not complex in taste but is very tasty and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta."
You can buy a lot of French wine here, but wines from New Zealand and Australia might be better able to withstand long-distance transportation.
The local tap water fully meets safe drinking standards, but if you're still concerned, you can easily buy bottled water.
For Australians, the concept of "flat white" coffee is still relatively unfamiliar. A small black coffee is an "espresso," the cream (not foam) on a cappuccino is piled high, and tea is not paired with milk.
Hot chocolate has reached the standards of Belgium. The juice is expensive, but the quality is very good.
Many people travel to the Great Barrier Reef throughout the year, and injuries from participating in the aforementioned activities are rare.
Nevertheless, it is important to heed the recommendations of the relevant authorities, adhere to all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near the beaches and river mouths of 1770 Town from October to April each year. Occasionally, they can also be spotted at other times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
The main habitat of the saltwater crocodile is not the ocean, but the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance can give travelers peace of mind, knowing that they have a place to stay upon arrival at their destination.
Although travel agencies may help you book camping and other forms of accommodations, they usually cooperate with specific hotels.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast and airport transfers, and some even provide flight and hotel accommodation packages.
If you need time to consider whether the price is appropriate, or if you need to obtain other documents (such as a visa) for the destination, they can hold the reservation for you.
If any modifications or requests are needed, they should first be handled through the travel agent rather than contacting the hotel directly.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants choose to camp on-site, and most participants believe this is an extremely important part of the festival experience.
If you want to watch the performance up close, you have to arrive early and secure a spot near the stage.
Remember, while the music on the main stage may have ended, other parts of the festival might continue playing music until late at night.
Some music festivals set up special camping areas for families with children.
If crossing the Northern Baltic Sea in winter, it's important to check the location of the cabin, as sailing on the ice can bring extremely dreadful noise to those most affected.
The St. Petersburg cruise includes city sightseeing activities. Cruise passengers may be exempt from visas (please refer to the terms of service for details).
Casinos usually try everything possible to get guests to spend as much time and money as possible. Casinos typically have no windows or clocks, and the exits are hard to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests happy and staying at the casino.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages for free. However, intoxication impairs a person's judgment, and all excellent gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high latitude areas or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On the ice-covered road, the friction is very small, and you can't drive as you would on a smooth asphalt road.
During a blizzard, the amount of snowfall in a very short time can be enough to trap you.
Snowfall, drifting snow, raindrops on the car window, or ice may also obstruct the view.
On the other hand, snowy and icy weather is very common in many countries, and transportation is hardly ever interrupted throughout the year.
Safari activities may be the most attractive tourist activities in Africa and a highlight of many travelers' itineraries.
The term "safari" in its common usage refers to traveling by land to view the astounding African wildlife, particularly on the savannahs.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to like being close to cars, and standard equipment allows people to enjoy them better.
Lions, leopards, and cheetahs are sometimes afraid of people, and you can see them more clearly with binoculars.
Hiking (also called "jungle walk," "trekking," or "hike") primarily involves walking on foot, usually taking several hours or lasting several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other parts of Japan.
Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, the first time being in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you might be in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March, most policies implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic had not been extended to July 2020—the originally scheduled time for the Olympics.
The ticket prices for most events are expected to range from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, with the average price being around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Even if the room doesn't have an iron and ironing board, many hotels offer loan services.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer (if you have one).
Be careful not to let the clothes become too hot (this may cause shrinkage, and in extreme cases, they may get scorched).
There are many methods of water purification, and some are more effective for specific pollutants.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others it takes a few minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have concerns about this, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter harmful animals that are not commonly seen in their hometown.
Pests can damage food, cause irritant reactions, and in more severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can harm humans through violence, are generally not considered pests.
Tax-free shopping refers to the opportunity to purchase duty-free goods at specific locations.
Travelers heading to countries/regions with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, as purchasing products like alcohol and tobacco in these places can be particularly cost-effective.
On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, the most challenging driving conditions are on the section between Point Marion and Fairmont, which frequently passes through many remote and isolated areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, you should stay alert: there are steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns everywhere.
The speed limit posted at this location is noticeably lower than the sections before and after, with the common speed limit being 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and the importance of strictly adhering to the speed limit is also greater than on other sections.
However, surprisingly, the cell service here is much stronger than on many other routes along the way (like the wilderness of Pennsylvania).
German pastries are quite good, and the pastries in Bavaria are even more varied, quite similar to their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit desserts are very common, apples can be used to make desserts all year round, and in summer, one can also enjoy cherries and plums.
Many German baked goods also feature almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes are often a perfect match with espresso.
If you want some rich-flavored snacks, you can try jam-filled pastries, which are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen in different regions.
Curry rice is a dish based on herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
Curry dishes can be either "dry" or "wet," depending on the amount of water used.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry, while in southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesia has 17,000 islands, so Indonesian cuisine is just a general term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines from across the country.
But without more modifiers, the term often refers to food that originated from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now, Javanese cuisine can be found everywhere on the archipelago, featuring several dishes with simple seasoning methods, and the main seasonings favored by the Javanese are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various spices.
The stirrups hang on either side of the saddle to support the rider's feet.
They provide better stability for riders, but there are also safety risks because a rider's foot might get stuck.
If a rider is thrown off the horse but has one foot caught in the stirrup, the horse may drag him along while running. To minimize this risk, some precautionary measures can be taken.
First, most horse riders wear heeled riding boots, and their soles are smooth and relatively narrow.
Secondly, some saddles—especially English saddles—are equipped with safety buckles, and if a rider falls and pulls backwards, the stirrup leathers will slide off the saddle.
Chile's top choice for mountaineering, Cochamó Valley, is known as the Yosemite of South America; here you will find a variety of granite walls and cliffs.
From the mountain peak, there are breathtaking and magnificent views. Climbers from all over the world continuously develop new routes on its continuous cliff faces that can serve as climbing walls.
Alpine skiing includes regular skiing and snowboarding, and is a very popular sport in which skis or a snowboard are attached to your feet to glide down snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is the main travel activity for many skiing enthusiasts, who are sometimes referred to as "skiing fanatics," and they plan to ski at a certain location for the entire holiday.
The idea of skiing has been around for a long time—cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
As a sport, alpine skiing can be traced back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Skiing free travel: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
This activity is related to alpine skiing trips or mountaineering, but these two activities are not usually undertaken. Both activities are performed on steep terrain and require stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine the ski route as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you can travel further than walking — but only in rare cases can you achieve the same speed as cross-country skiing on a flat track without carrying a heavy backpack.
Europe is a continent with a relatively small area but many independent countries. Generally, traveling across multiple countries means having to undergo visa applications and passport checks multiple times.
However, in this regard, the Schengen Area is somewhat like a single country.
As long as you reside in this area, you can usually pass through the border directly without undergoing another passport checkpoint inspection.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa to each Schengen member country separately, thereby saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no uniform definition of which processed items are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define items over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition varies by region, with the year limit in places like North America potentially being shorter than in Europe.
Handicrafts may be defined as antiques, even though they are much younger in age compared to mass-produced counterparts.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami people. The culture surrounding the industry is also significant for many people who make a living in other professions.
However, even in the traditional sense, not all Sámi people were involved in large-scale reindeer herding; they made a living through activities such as fishing and hunting, and typically used reindeer as draft animals.
Nowadays, many Sámi people are engaged in modern industries. The tourism industry is a major source of income for Sápmi, which is the Sámi region.
Although the term "Gypsy" is widely used and especially popular among non-Romani people, it is generally considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Romani people.
If the country you are visiting is under a travel warning, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the advice of other governments besides your own country, but their advice is tailored for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different circumstances than Europeans or Arabs.
Travel advisories can only provide a brief summary of the local situation.
Compared to the more detailed information provided elsewhere, the advice provided here is often rather vague, generalized, and overly simplistic.
Severe weather is a general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon; this type of weather can cause damage, significant social disruption, or casualties.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world. There are various types of severe weather, depending on geographical location, terrain, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, wildfires, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones, are all manifestations and impacts of extreme weather.

Strongly advise travelers to pay attention to the risk of severe weather in their location, as it may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to countries that may be considered war zones should receive professional training.
Search for "Hostile Environment Course" on the internet, and you might find the addresses of local companies that offer training.
This course usually covers all the issues discussed here, often delving into them through practical experience.
The course training usually lasts 2-5 days and involves role-playing, first aid training, and sometimes arms training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, but publications about survival in war zones are rare.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must carry valid documents on their return trip.
As for whether governments are willing to issue passports that do not specify gender (X), or to amend documents to match desired names and genders, the willingness of different governments varies.
The degree of recognition of these documents by foreign governments varies widely.
In the era after September 11, 2001, searches at security checkpoints have also become more troublesome.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery are forced to disclose their privacy when passing through scanners and cannot ensure their own dignity.
A rip current is a fast-flowing current that flows back into the sea from the beach, usually occurring at reefs or similar places.
The underwater topography causes the backflow to concentrate in a few deeper areas, where rip currents may form flowing towards deeper water.
Most deaths are caused by swimming against the current and exhaustion, and it is unlikely to succeed when swimming against the flow.
After escaping the rushing current, swimming back was not as difficult.
Swim hard towards a place where you won't be trapped again, or wait for rescue (depending on your skills and whether you've been detected).
The impact of returning home comes faster (with a shorter honeymoon period), lasts longer, and may be more severe than culture shock.
For travelers who easily adapt to new cultures, it is sometimes difficult to readjust to their native culture.
After living abroad for a while and returning home, you will find that you have adapted to the new culture and lost some habits of your hometown culture.
When you first go abroad, people may be very patient and understanding because they know that travelers need to adapt to a new country.
People may not realize that travelers also need patience and understanding on their return journey.
For children, the sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting activities in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them silently there before the show starts.
Usually, you can hear the sounds of tourists and street vendors here. Light and sound intertwine, as if telling a moving story.
On the backdrop is the Sphinx, which is also the narrator of the long story.
The scene is displayed on the pyramids, with different pyramids being illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819. Several countries claim sovereignty over the islands, and they have the most bases; in 2020, there were sixteen bases in use on the islands.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the Antarctic Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, which is home to the settlement of "Villa Las Estrellas."
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where a still-active caldera is flooded, providing a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is located in the southern part of the peninsula, facing the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountain ranges on the peninsula merge into the plateau here, and then re-form the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountains, which are split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or the Sentinel Range, contains Antarctica's highest mountain range, the Vinson Massif, with its highest peak, Mount Vinson, at 4,892 meters.
In remote areas where mobile phone signals cannot reach, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Generally speaking, satellite phones cannot replace mobile phones because calls can only be made outdoors where the satellite signal is clear.
The service is often used for shipping, including yachts and expeditions that have long-distance data and voice requirements.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide detailed information about connecting to this service.
For those planning how to spend their gap year, study tours are becoming an increasingly popular choice.
This is especially popular among high school graduates, as they can take a year off before going to college without affecting their education.
In many cases, participating in a gap year program abroad can substantially enhance your chances of pursuing further studies upon returning home.
Usually, participating in these educational programs requires paying tuition.
Finland is an excellent destination for sailing, renowned as the "Land of a Thousand Lakes," with thousands of islands within its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelago and among the lakes, yachts are not necessary.
The size of the coastal islands and the largest lakes is sufficient to accommodate any yacht, but smaller boats or even kayaks can offer a different experience.
Rowing is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand have similar situations, but in other respects are quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands, this number is one in forty).
Most typical Baltic cruises have an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that there can be several days of full time to visit this historic city, and then return to the ship to sleep at night.
If landing is only in the context of a boat tour, no separate visa is required (as of the rules until 2009).
Some cruise ships highlight Berlin, Germany, in their brochures. As can be seen from the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, and the cruise price does not include a tour of the city.
For people of all ages and backgrounds, flying can be a terrifying experience, especially if they have never flown before or have had painful experiences.
This is not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from the fear and loathing many people have for other things.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and the procedures of flying may help overcome the fear of unknown or uncontrollable situations.
The courier company can earn high remuneration for fast delivery of goods. Many times, time is very important for business documents, goods, or parts used for emergency repairs.
On certain routes, large companies have their own planes, but for other routes and small companies, there are problems.
If they transport the goods by air, it may take several days to unload and clear customs on certain routes.
The fastest way is to check it in as baggage. According to airline regulations, it is prohibited to transport the luggage of passengers who haven't boarded, which requires your presence at that time.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to spend a lot of money to enjoy the privilege (or, even better, have your company pay for it).
However, this is not cheap: according to rough estimates, the price of a business class ticket may be 4 times that of a regular economy class ticket, and a first class ticket is as much as 11 times higher!
Generally speaking, for a direct flight from place A to place B, there is no need to look for discounted business or first-class tickets.
The airline is well aware that some core passengers are willing to pay a high price for the privilege of fast and comfortable travel, so the airline charges accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic, plagued by ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova. This republic has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any United Nations member states.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, the economic connections between the two regions of Moldova have been rebuilt.
The main religion of Moldova is Eastern Orthodoxy.

Do not mark or graffiti on the buildings to avoid damaging the site.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the locals prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand Catalan, and as for Spanish, almost everyone can understand it.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, as it is the legally mandated primary official language.

More traditional churches often hold Easter Vigil services on the Saturday night of Easter weekend, with the congregation usually pouring into the celebration at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
Originally, the animals reached these islands by swimming, flying, or drifting.
Because they are far from the mainland, mammals are unable to make long journeys, making giant tortoises the main herbivores of the Galapagos Islands.
After humans arrived at the Galápagos Islands, many mammals were introduced, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you travel to the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can experience the polar night, a period during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
