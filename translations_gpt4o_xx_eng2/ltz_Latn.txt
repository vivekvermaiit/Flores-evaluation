This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widely spread theory, but also provides details that fossils usually cannot deliver, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on top with a blotchy or carotenoid-colored underside.
The fund also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed shaft (called rachis), but had other characteristics of feathers – barbs and vanes – researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development compared to the other features.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flight, but for temperature regulation or appearance. The researchers have suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen comes from adult feathers and not from the down of a chick.
The researchers have suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen comes from adult feathers and not from the down of a juvenile.

They found out that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: The activity of all stars in the system was driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is regarding magnetic reversals.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory posits that most dark matter resides in a kind of halo around a galaxy and consists of many small particles.

This extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was discovered by Dr. Tony Moll in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new variant "was very concerning and alarming due to the very high lethality rate."
A few patients might have been infected in the hospital, says Dr. Moll, and at least two were hospital staff.
In one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the whole group of people with tuberculosis still seems to be low; 6,000 of the total 330,000 people were infected at a certain point in South Africa.

Infrared images show that the temperature fluctuations from day to night prove that it is probably about caves.
They are cooler during the day than the surrounding surface and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but they are consistent with being deep holes in the ground, said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) astrogeology team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: Voters isolate themselves in a booth, place a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter casts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The French voting rights codify the procedure rather strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are inside at the beginning of the voting process and that no envelopes are added besides those from the properly registered and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision according to special procedures.

Her other race, the giant slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting giant slalom with a combined runtime of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed Austrian, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-placed Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's sit-ski group could not finish their descent, and 45 out of the total 117 skiers in the giant slalom did not qualify.
The police of Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen laptop and the mobile phone.
The Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and we have recovered her mobile phone and her laptop."
The accused were Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The president of police, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, said that the accused appeared in court with concealed faces.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
The driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed while the rescue service freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was also charged at the Sheriff Court Edinburgh with the murder of her boy.
She is in pre-trial detention until she is charged and brought to court, but all witness statements could be anticipated because her photo was widely published.
That is common in other parts of Great Britain, but Scottish justice operates differently, and courts have considered the publication of photos potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes "that journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line when they publish photos of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for prosecution, has informed journalists that no further comments would be made until the indictment.
The document refers, according to the data leak, to the disputed border area that Palestine claims based on the borders prior to the Six-Day War in 1967.
Further alleged topics include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a permanent military presence for ten years in the valley as soon as an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority only wants to allow this presence for five years.
The shooters in the supplementary pest control study should be closely monitored by rangers because the study was supervised and its effectiveness assessed.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the deputy director for park protection and heritage at NPWS (National Parks and Wildlife Service), the four selected shooters received comprehensive instructions on safety and training for the first shooting procedure.
Martelly swore in a new provisional electoral council (CEP) with nine members yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failed elections, which have been due since 2011.
There were approximately 60 cases of iPods overheating reported, which altogether led to six fires and four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 more overheating incidents to them, which the company described as "not of concern."
The ministry reacted to the delay of the report by Apple by calling it "truly regrettable."
The earthquake hit Mariana at 7:19 local time (9:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management reported that no damage was reported throughout the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the Philippine capital.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
A few hostages were rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
During his work at the hospital, Liggins began studying premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that when a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the fetal lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two black boxes on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid their last respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. Luna left us on the night of the two moons. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as crazy as I was... maybe even a little more... I love her and miss her... hopefully, she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 surveyed before the federal election in 2010, those who are against Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the survey participants share this view and would like Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Among the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness was questioned.
He was not able to take medication to overcome his pain because they are prohibited during the games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
A few people verified the discovery with the help of different hardware until the beginning of February, and this was announced on Tuesday.
Comets, possibly together with organic substances that can form proteins and support life, were a source of water supplies to Earth.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth was formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Earlier this year, Cuomo took office as governor at the age of 53 and last month signed a bill for the legalization of same-sex marriages.
He described the rumors as "political gossip and stupidity."
It is speculated that he will run for the presidential elections in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will enable airplanes to fly shorter distances, save millions of tons of fuel, and reduce CO₂ emissions.
He uses satellite-based technology as opposed to the older ground radar-based technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate planes with greater precision and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional means of transport will be deployed, and overcrowded trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on site.
The fear of missing means of transport has increased the possibility that the game might have to be held behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in Science reported on the emergence of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species developed in just two generations, although the process likely took much longer due to the breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all possible forms. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be worked with a hammer and rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and stuck onto other metal. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures and books, called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is referred to as the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator using juice from red cabbage.
Cabbage juice changes its color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (the H in the pH value) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then press them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feel rough and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had almost every house connected to an elaborate sewage system through a flush toilet.
In the buildings of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, remnants of wastewater systems were found.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. Among the Romans, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women would gather together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light in the view.
It takes a huge rocket over 30 meters high to bring a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in indescribable ways. The greatest advantage we owe to the wheel is much faster and easier transportation options.
It brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Among them, there are more medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
After all, there are many small cats (including free-roaming house cats) that consume the much larger number of small catches like insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a special task that each cat has, which prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called prides.
A pack consists of one to four adult males, together with up to thirty females and young.
The women are usually close family with each other because they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave similarly to those of wolves or dogs – animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior – and they are also very deadly to their prey.
As a well-conditioned athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump far, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the sonorous roar of a lion, but rather like a sentence twisted, howling words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, if they can. Almost all animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists think that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) by sniffing where they were on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and also move well. Ocelots hunt their prey by adapting to their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
If a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population they came from (such as moving across a mountain or river, or relocating to a new island and thus not easily returning), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one they were in before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and competitors, so the new population needs new properties or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than it was before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable phenomenon and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses and produce our clothes from plants. The majority of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were lined with more than 70 knife-sharp teeth, along with an additional set on the gums, which meant there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We do not know for sure, but he might have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he might even have been a cannibal.
He also tackled everything that came into the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T-Rex could not compete with him.
Although most of their food would seem familiar to us, the Romans had some strange or unusual meals, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and women sat on chairs and ate, the rich men liked to hold banquets together, where they would lie on their side while eating.
Meals in the Old World could not contain foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
They had neither corn, nor tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no old Romans ever ate turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a primary temple, which was considered the home of the god.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Near East, houses were not so important.
The greatest part of the life of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the garden, the shops had only open counters to the street. Stone was used for building houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, therefore wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences regarding people, kings, customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie 'National Treasure,' then you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That is not true, however. Although there is something on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776" written. The text is located at the bottom of the reversed document.
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 75.57 cm x 62.23 cm) was rolled up early in its life for storage.
It is therefore likely that the note was simply added as a description.
The landing on D-Day and the subsequent battles had liberated Northern France, but the South was still occupied.
He was governed by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
Not even two weeks later, the Americans and the Free French Forces had liberated Southern France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together in a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civic, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and also somehow determines the extent of society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilization culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and a proper dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving important historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary Wars, thirteen states first formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation – with Congress being its only component.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state agencies, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all its actions.
He also did not have the authority to override tax laws and excise duties between the states.
The clauses required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government lightly, so their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the champion of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are very popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan comprises almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), which makes Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in geographical terms.
Taiwan already has its origins in the 15th century when European sailors sailing past recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, initiated a transformation of the indigenous people's core production, and employed Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In the year 1683, the troops of the Qing dynasty (1644 – 1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which sovereignty over Taiwan was ceded to Japan, which controlled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they used to look like.
In the year 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
The most widely used global photo format for still images is, for example, 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced nowadays, but above all, its aspect ratios have been overtaken by the formats of digital camera image sensors.
The 35-mm format is actually, if you round it a bit, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS format family) correspond to this aspect ratio or closely approximate it.
The often misused and frequently mocked Rule of Thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while simultaneously maintaining a measure of order in an image.
They claim that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was put to the test.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had held the European states together despite differences in language and customs.
Her all-pervasive power affected everyone, from the king to the common citizen.
One of the most important Christian teachings is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the Church's funds are there especially for that reason.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
The strategy proved effective by cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law, which had been codified by several international agreements over the last two centuries.
Great Britain has mined international waters to prevent ships from sailing through entire sections of the ocean, which has even put neutral ships at risk.
Because there was only a limited reaction to this tactic, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a volume of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his last job) to Thomas Edison.
That ancient China had a unique way of indicating different eras: each phase of China or each ruling family was a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an uncertain time with divided provinces. The most famous of these eras was the epoch of the 'Three Kingdoms', which lasted 60 years and lay between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, a fierce war took place between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not just to a single ruler.
After the revolution, jobs were open to all male applicants, which allowed the most ambitious and successful ones to make it.
The same applies to the military, because instead of army rankings based on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also encouraged numerous other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was deeply interested in things beyond this worldly life. He frequently visited a cave known as 'Hira' on the 'Noor' (Light) mountain for contemplation.
The wood itself, which has endured for centuries, provides a very vivid picture of Mohammed's spiritual tendencies.
The cave is situated on a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find at all, even if one knew that it existed. Once you are in the cave, you are completely isolated.
There is only the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains to see. When one is in the cave, one can see or hear very little of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures constructed to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
On the Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, there are several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), a few small tombs, a few temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Cheops, and some of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected to honor Cheops' wives and family members.
The "upward bow" looks like a V, and the "downward bow" like a bracket or a square that is missing the bottom.
Above means that you should start at the tip and push the bow, and below means that you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upstroke usually produces a softer sound, while a downstroke is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to make your own markings in pencil, but remember that the printed bowings are there for musical reasons and should therefore generally be adhered to.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (the 11-year-old Marie Therese and the four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced back to Paris by a mob of market women from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
They rode back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob of people who shouted and screamed insults against the King and Queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to have their carriage windows wide open.
At one point, a participant from the mob held up the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the queen, who was terrified to death.
The war expenses of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime, as a large part of the expenses and the interest on the bonds flowed through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
Naturally, the super-profits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would represent the fundamental achievements of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the Order.
The era in which the events took place is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages, which generally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice; from technology-push or technological necessity to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influence and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
One could, for example, say that the car necessarily led to the development of roads.
A nationwide road network is not economically profitable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce costs for the vehicle owner.
Mass motorization also leads to a higher frequency of accidents on the roads, which results in the invention of new techniques in healthcare for the repair of damaged bodies.
The Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In connection with Romanticism, geography has shaped individuals, and over time traditions and cultures have emerged that are linked to this geography, and they were better than arbitrarily imposed laws because they were in harmony with the place of society.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of today's world, Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Their status declined mainly during the twelfth century due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than what Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital was passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak during the period between the 10th to 11th and the 14th century.
At the beginning, Byzantine culture had a very strong influence on clothing in the East.
Styles in the West, however, could lag behind by 25 to 30 years due to slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments from that time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is agriculture that is carried out to produce enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that combines seeds originating from the ecoregion with crop rotation or uses other relatively simple techniques to optimize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, and that is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring like-minded individuals together who feel neglected by societal standards, enabling them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style that includes fashion, behavior, and argot.
One of the most frequently used methods to illustrate the meaning of socialization is to refer to a few fortunate cases of children who were not socialized due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse by adults while they were growing up.
Such children are called "feral." Some feral children were confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, this confinement of the child was due to the parents' rejection of severe mental or physical impairments.
Adolescent runaways may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
If a wild child is raised by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) that are almost entirely similar to those of the respective foster animal, such as fear of or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a support that assists individuals who are experiencing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but this also applies to the small paperclip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and should question, encourage, and explain processes that might have been too difficult for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care facilities for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not supportive, social, and educational, but that is just how it is.
We see the care system as a safety net for these children.
Our care system should provide a safe home, caregivers who have a very warm manner, stable training, and reliable healthcare.
Care provision should make available all the necessities that were lacking in the house from which they were previously removed.
The internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The inherent properties of the internet lead to additional dimensions with regard to the uses and gratifications approach.
For example, 'Learning' and 'Socialization' are considered important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
'Personal engagement' and 'enduring relationships' were identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new motivational aspects when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions – facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Above all, it is claimed that one can recognize if a person is suffering by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks pointed out in his paper The President's Speech how people who cannot understand language due to brain damage can still accurately judge sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities are shared in interpreting human behavior by animals like domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two poles of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation while selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Separation and recombination shift the variation between the two pools back and forth with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of a human to meet its amino acid needs with the available plant resources.
Moreover, it has serious consequences if you don't do it: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest if not cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (crickets, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they also provide a wealth of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors had solved their "protein problem" in almost the same way as chimpanzees do nowadays in the savannah.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening during the normal sleep period and then going back to sleep shortly afterwards (10–60 minutes later).
This can easily be achieved by using a relatively gentle alarm clock to bring you to consciousness but not fully awaken you.
If you set the alarm clock back while sleeping, it can be placed on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before going to sleep, which forces one to get up to urinate.
The measure of inner peace that a person possesses inversely correlates with the level of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the existing life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was expanded through the Mahayana path of love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is quite simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The central point of Tibetan meditation is the Guru Yoga. By visualizing various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment created.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to a collaboration between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the clashes of system, process, and culture led to the downfall of the countries.
Two years after the war, the former allies had turned into enemies, which ushered in the Cold War.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and be fought out by proxies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and numerous other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian Bridgehead.
These plans, however, became almost obsolete overnight when 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union marched in and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after they invaded the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for freight transport is by far the most efficient way to transport many people and goods across oceans.
The traditional task of the navy is to ensure that their country retains the ability to move their people and goods, while at the same time disrupting the ability of their enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the most remarkable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans tried to get men and material across the Atlantic to assist Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy tried, mainly with submarines, to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Great Britain and the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
All cultures and peoples have kept it for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in flocks that wandered on hills or other pasture lands, often tended by goatherds who were often children and adolescents, similar to the well-known shepherds. This method of herding is still used today.
Railways were already built in England in the 16th century.
Although tramways mainly consisted of parallel wooden rails, they allowed horses to pull wagons faster and larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Railway sleepers were introduced quite early to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, it turned out that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
That became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first solid iron rails were introduced.
The first known form of transport was walking; humans began walking upright 2 million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal specializations are found in fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus might already have walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join an environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
That is in many cases like a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not only want a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and we should eliminate them.
It is obvious enough that the scientific and technological advancements of humanity have greatly changed the world and the problems have been exacerbated by overpopulation and the excessive lifestyle of humanity.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a little further to the printing office of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
He was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides, which we know still exist, are the oldest copies of the document. The handwritten original copy has not survived.
Nowadays, many paleontologists are convinced that a group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. We call them birds.
Many people do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things in birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Practically all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are considered binary digits – or bits (to use computer language).
An internal poisoning is possibly not immediately detectable. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that a direct diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open container with medication or toxic household chemicals.
On the label, you will find specific first aid instructions for the respective poison.
The term Kiewerlek is used by entomologists in the formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from the old familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both the assassin bugs and the bed bugs are nest dwellers, which have adapted to life in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the main neurological disorder among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Researchers have found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple can decide that it is not in their best interest – or that of their child – to raise a baby.
These couples can decide to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In the case of an adoption, the birth parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the parents of the child.
The main goal of science is to clarify how the world works through the scientific method. This method definitely guides the majority of scientific research.
She does not do it alone, experimenting – and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses – asking questions and making observations are also part of conducting scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As the knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West lost its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely reactions to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are autonomous oscillators that continue to run for a while even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading proposals that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments that either labeled the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the part of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other locations can result in cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the plant and animal life.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in cars to drive to their workplaces and pass by those whose work destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supported by a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has disrupted one of the stable states of the biosphere that supported the evolution of humanity over the past 2 million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In industrialized countries, one rarely hears complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation planners simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental behind it?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows have a reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the air. Their ability to fly helped them to evade enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage that they can fold their wings back along their body.
That offers them a wider range of small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, mayflies and caddisflies are the only insects unable to fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolves around the sun.
A few people thought he was right, but many people assumed the opposite; that the solar system would revolve around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second-longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times as much water as the second-largest river.
The Amazon is the widest river on Earth, at places nearly 9.7 kilometers wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from rivers worldwide into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical achievement of the construction of the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were then over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of most people who work for the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Already in antiquity, people knew basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper, because they can all be discovered in nature in their natural form and can be relatively easily extracted with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
That was more than the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma; although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are mainly a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Naturally, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys with small quantities of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so surrealistically small that billions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
The pencil was therefore a good friend for many people when it was invented.
Unfortunately, the pencil has become less important and used with the development of new writing methods.
People now type messages on computer screens and don't need sharpeners anymore.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb operates on the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. The renewed division of the cell nucleus then releases part of this energy.
A few atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they disintegrate with little or no provocation.
The surface of the moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the side facing towards and about 100 km thick on the side facing away.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker over the highland.
There may be more craters on the facing side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to reach the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what makes people tick or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that were internalized when they reached adulthood.
This theory considers what it is about certain people who want the things they want, and what things in their environment lead them to want certain things or not.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory on the hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum attempts to remain 'one of the colleagues' (or female colleagues).
This type of leadership struggles to make unpopular decisions, enforce disciplinary measures, conduct performance evaluations, delegate responsibility, and hold employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one turns into an unrecognizable person who feels like they must change everything the team has done and make it their own.
After all, the boss is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often led to a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same quality standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as contact points for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, because their teams can meet according to the respective time zones, which is not necessarily understood by the local management.
The dedication of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989 p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to which every single member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization undertake the time-consuming process of building a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
If all available resources are effectively deployed in the functional areas of a company, creativity and ingenuity can be expressed.
Here, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that serves the needs of the clients.
For an organization to be innovative, it must first create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge in organizational learning.
In 2006, Angel explains continuous use as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, they narrow the research field and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
New technologies allow us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
That provides us with extensive information and material to create simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong connotation with science fiction, AI forms a very important field of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
AI research involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include taxation, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer client diagnoses and queries, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on offering solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, technology, and military, but is also incorporated into many home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips make up a large part of every class. Often a schoolteacher would like to take his students to places where a bus ride is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual excursions. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual trip is a good opportunity to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future classes.
Each year, the students from Bennet School in North Carolina, for example, design a website about their trip to the state capital; the website is revamped every year, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing. While students often start their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, the awareness of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
Blogging "also forces students to become more familiar with the world around them." The need to capture the audience's interest inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that promotes collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
An appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to online material, students can define their positions in the context of others' comments and also highlight their own perspectives on certain topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada and features a range of art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
Further south lie the Niagara Falls and to the north lies the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as what foreigners consider typically Canadian.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a comparison of the population that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the USA than Canadians.
The East African islands lie in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent of its own when it comes to flora and fauna.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the countries, and it was a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the sea route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region borders the Sahel zone, in the south and west the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that traveling women say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should recognize that cultural differences can lead to what they might consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be pursued, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Do not be afraid to be assertive when rejecting men, and do not worry about cultural differences; it is still not right!
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the Marinids under the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and Spanish traders, who established trade bases there, called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
English sentence: Around the Old Town of Medina you can easily find places where traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a variety of souvenirs are sold, but that's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside Goma should be examined to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo Volcano, as well as for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla excursions in Africa.
You can take a Boda-Boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
In combination with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" was used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway countries.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites due to the threat from desert sand.
It was one of the most important stations during the PBS Special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city stands in stark contrast to the other cities of the country, as it has more of an Arabic than an African flair.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forms the southern boundary.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each housing distinct wildlife.
He is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park here as well.
It can also be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card, which offers access to either a selection of parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the area of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists see as the main focus.
The parade of buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a glittering bar chart, which is accentuated by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the Kowloon promenade opposite.
The major part of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists claimed for themselves, and if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, extending from the coast over 80 km (50 miles) into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, not only consist of mangrove swamps – they include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty jungles that used to stretch across the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans extend over an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one-third is covered with water bodies/marshlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a nature reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and over 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses run all day long from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river), with most buses, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, departing between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since the interdistrict buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes that are 3.5 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it was only opened for traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs clearance is expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group that lived in what is now Paraguay and were semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was the homeland of other groups of indigenous tribes like the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies," was born as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native indigenous groups.
For the Spaniards, the Age of Colonization began, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in the year 1537, Paraguay has preserved a large part of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having the best polo team and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and games can also be watched here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check with the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official Falkland currency is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to a British pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the 'FIC West' store.
The British Pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are often accepted as well.
On the remote islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, although British and US currency is accepted; check with the owners in advance to see what an acceptable payment method is.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo lies in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures are usually over +30 degrees Celsius.
Winter can be deceptively chilly: Temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There is no particular "rainy" and "dry" season: The amount of rain remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and you should not feed or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, one should keep a distance of at least 100 meters from bears and wolves, and 25 meters from all other wild animals.
No matter how tame they look, bison, moose, elk, bears and pretty much all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they do not keep enough distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous; so give them their space.
Moreover, you should be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strongly scented foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia, with just under 40,000 inhabitants, is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the scene of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of the high-ranking leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches due to the two harbors of Auckland. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The 'North Shore' beaches (in the 'North Harbour' district) lie on the Pacific and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches where one can swim safely, and most offer shade from Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at Waitemata Harbour and the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes overcrowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
There are two local beers, the most important one is 'Number One', it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing; the other one is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that one must have tried, but the New Zealand and Australian wines might be easier to get there.
The tap water can be safely drunk, but mineral water is easy to find if you don't feel comfortable.
For Australians, the idea of 'Flat White' coffee is exotic. A short black is called 'Espresso', cappuccino has whipped cream on top (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot cocoa meets Belgian standards. Fruit juice is expensive but excellent.
Many excursions to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to one of these causes at the reef are rare.
Nonetheless, ask the authorities for advice, follow all the signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish have been appearing on the beaches and river mouths from October to April since 1770. Sometimes they can also be found outside of that period.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
If booked in advance, the traveler can be completely reassured that they will have a place to sleep when they reach their destination.
Travel agents often have offers for certain hotels, although you may also book other forms of accommodation such as campsites through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to reconsider the offer or to obtain other documents for your travel destination (e.g., visa).
Changes or requests should first be addressed to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, most of the participants of music festivals decide to camp on site, and most visitors consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be right where the action is, you have to get up early to get a camping spot near the music.
Note that even when the music on the main stage is coming to an end, there may still be areas of the festival where music plays late into the night.
A few festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, then check the condition of the cabin, as the passage through ice can cause quite a frightening noise for those most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos generally strive hard to maximize the time spent and money spent by clients. Windows and clocks are usually missing and exits are difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment offers to keep guests in good spirits and on the premises.
Some event venues offer alcoholic drinks on the house. But alcohol impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Everyone who travels in high latitudes or over a mountain pass should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and one cannot drive as if one were driving on tarmac.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short time for one to get stuck.
Visibility can also be restricted by falling or blown snow or condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions in many countries are normal, and traffic usually continues without interruption throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attractions in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term Safari in popular usage refers to overland journeys to see the amazing African wildlife, especially the savanna.
A few animals like elephants and giraffes tend to approach closely to cars and standard equipment enables good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you see them better with a telescope.
A walking safari (other terms are "bush walk," "walking safari," or "on foot") consists of hikes, either lasting a few hours or days.
The Paralympic Games are held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events are held at different locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted the Olympic Summer Games twice, having already hosted them in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, then you are likely in a tricky situation.
Cancellation conditions vary, but since the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies are not valid until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing about ¥7,000.
Hanging damp clothes out to dry can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for borrowing, even if one is not in the room.
If no stretching spray is available, or you don't feel like wearing stretched tights, you can try using a hairdryer, if available.
Be careful that the fabric does not get too hot (which can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, lead to burns).
There are various methods for the purification of water, some are more effective against specific threats.
In a few areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others a few minutes are necessary.
Filters have varying effectiveness, and if you have concerns, you should buy your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests in their home regions that they are not familiar with.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritations or, in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill humans are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods at certain places that are exempt from taxes and excises.
Travelers entering countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often leads through remote forests.
If you are used to driving on country roads, then keep your senses sharp: steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp bends prevail.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the preceding and following sections - usually 56-64 km/h (35-40 mph) - and adhering to them strictly is even more important than usual.
Strangely, the cell service here is much stronger than along other sections, e.g., the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit pastries are common; apples are used in pastries all year round, and cherries and plums are added in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes often pair especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you are looking for small but rich pastries, try what is offered as Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, cooked together with meat or vegetables.
A curry can vary from "dry" to "a sauce" depending on the liquid content.
In the rice-growing regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a general term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines from all over the nation.
If it is used without further qualification, the term usually means food from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine is now widespread throughout the archipelago and offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, with the predominant flavors of Javanese cuisine being peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet and hang on both sides of the saddle.
They offer more stability for the rider, but they can raise safety concerns because the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but a foot gets caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged along if the horse runs off. To reduce this risk, various safety measures can be taken.
For the first time, all riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup strap to fall off the saddle when pulled from behind by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with numerous large granite walls and cliffs.
Summits offer breathtaking views from the peaks. Mountaineers from all parts of the world always find new routes amidst the endless potential of walls.
Alpine snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrains with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity with many enthusiasts, occasionally also called "ski fanatics," who plan their entire vacations around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back to around 5000 BC!
The sport of skiing dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational skiing club was founded by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to that, but is usually not associated with alpine skiing-like tours or mountaineering, whereas the latter takes place on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine the ski trail like a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you can cover slightly larger distances than by foot – but only very rarely will you reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean that one would have to apply for a few visas and go through passport controls.
The Schengen Area functions in this regard similarly to a country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Exactly, with a Schengen visa you do not need to apply for a visa separately for each Schengen member state, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition by which handmade objects are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define goods that are over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical differences, with the age limit in countries like North America possibly being lower than in Europe.
Handcrafted products could be defined as antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami and the culture around the trade is also important for many with other professions.
Also, traditionally, not all Sámi were extensively involved in reindeer herding, but lived from fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and kept reindeer largely as draught animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern crafts. Tourism is an important income in Sápmi, the land of the Sámi.
Although it is widespread, especially among non-Roma, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and the inaccurate perception of Roma.
If the country you wish to visit is subject to a travel warning, it may affect your travel health or travel cancellation insurance.
Perhaps you also want to accept the advice of other governments than your own, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
As an example, American citizens might be confronted with different situations in the Near East than Europeans or Arabs.
Advisories are nothing more than a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The presented views are often superficial, general, and oversimplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, significant social disruption, or loss of human life.
Storms can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hailstones, excessive rainfall, and forest fires are forms and effects of severe weather such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and hurricanes.
The regional and seasonal storm phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are often advised to be aware of the danger of storms that may occur in their area, as they can affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
English sentence: In an internet search for 'hostile environmental course', the address of a local company is likely to appear.
A course usually covers all the problems discussed here in much more detail, generally combined with practical experience.
A course normally lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing and a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines that deal with wilderness survival are common, but there are only a few publications that focus on war zones.
Travelers planning a gender transition abroad must ensure they have valid documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports where the gender is not indicated (X) or updated documents to reflect a change of name or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents varies greatly.
Searches at security checkpoints became much more intrusive in the period after September 11, 2001.
Preoperative transgender individuals should not expect to pass through the scanner and have their privacy and dignity remain intact.
Rip currents are the returning flows of waves that break on the shore, often at a reef or similar.
Based on the underwater topology, the backflow concentrates on a few deeper sections, and a rapid current and deep water can form there.
Most deaths are the result of fatigue when trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to reach somewhere where you won't be pulled back in, or depending on your abilities and whether you have been noticed, it might be advisable to wait for rescue.
The reverse culture shock occurs earlier than culture shock (has less of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be difficult.
Travelers who could easily adapt to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return home after a stay abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some habits from your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers have to adapt in a new country.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are necessary even for travelers who are going back home.
The pyramid town and light show is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the Pyramids in the darkness and you can see them in peace before the show starts.
Usually, you always hear the noise of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a fairy tale book.
The Sphinx is considered the background and narrator of a long narrative.
The scenes are depicted on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in the year 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active in the year 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's peaks merge here with the plateau, then reappear to form the 360-km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which are split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, also called the Sentinel Range, are the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson as the highest point at 4,892 m.
In remote areas without mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone because you have to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite in order to make a call.
The service is often used by shipping, including sports boats, as well as expeditions that require external data and speech recognition.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information on how you can connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a year abroad is to travel and learn.
That is especially popular with school leavers, enabling them to take a year off before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling for a year abroad can actually improve your chances of higher education when you return home.
Normally, tuition fees are incurred to enroll in these study programs.
Finland is a wonderful travel destination for boat tours. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has a few thousand islands in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes, one does not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for yachts, smaller boats or simply a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland with a boat for seven to eight people.
That can be found in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g., the number in Holland is about one in forty).
Most of the various Baltic cruises offer a longer stay in St. Petersburg (Russia).
That means you can visit the historic city for a few days while sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only disembark with a cruise ship, then you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
A few cruises advertise with Berlin (Germany) in the brochures. However, as you can see on the map above, Berlin is not on the sea and the price of the cruise does not include a visit to the city.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: It is no different from the personal fears and aversions towards other things that many other people have.
For some, understanding how a plane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear of the unknown or not having control.
Courier companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Often, time is critical for business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On a few routes, the largest companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, there was a problem.
If they sent things by air freight, it could have taken days on some routes before everything was unloaded and cleared through customs.
The only way to get it faster was to send it as checked baggage. The airline's regulations do not allow you to send luggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious thing about the opportunity to fly in first or business class is to charge a lot of money for the privilege (or even better, to have your company pay for it).
That will not be cheap though: As a rough rule of thumb, one can expect to pay up to four times as much as for Business and eleven times as much as for First Class!
Generally, it makes no sense to even look for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain core of air travelers – those who are willing to pay lots of dollars for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably – and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The official language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistria Republic in the east of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is recognized by none of the UN member states.
Economic connections were re-established between the two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Christian Orthodox.
İzmir, with around 3.7 million inhabitants, is the third-largest city in Turkey, the second-largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
If it was once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center situated around a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
The broad boulevards, the buildings with glass facades, and the modern shopping centers are interspersed with traditional red tile roofs, the market from the 18th century, and old mosques and churches, although the city has more of an atmosphere of the European Mediterranean than of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík, with a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy, features an exceptional octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves on a few graves.
It's worth taking a half-hour stroll through the fascinating village.
In the north and easy to reach, lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after a passionate depiction of its splendor recorded by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb Bus 403 regularly goes to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, you must also visit the significant shrine of Fátima, a place worldwide known for Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave, as well as a site that holds an almost incalculable significance for another part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women living who survived their time here, and many more who were killed or worked to death, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make any jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not vandalize the site by marking or scratching the structures with graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the people speak Catalan, a very large part understands it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
Most of the signs, however, are only in Catalan because it is legally established as the first official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the metro are only made in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in numerous languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have the reputation of being egocentric, impolite, and arrogant.
Although this is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is still to show your best side and behave like a "bien élevée" (well-mannered) person. It makes everything considerably easier.
The abrupt behavior of the Parisians fades quickly if you are a bit polite.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park has many forests – mainly beeches, spruces, and pines – and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
He has a remarkably large diversity of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils, and varying altitudes.
The region is also home to an extremely large variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the capercaillie can be found there, along with many other species.
During the visit to the monasteries, women must wear skirts that go over the knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide a shawl for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially a colorful one, you will be greeted with a smile by the monk or nun at the entrance.
In the same way, men have to wear shorts that go over the knees.
You can also borrow those from the rack at the entrance, but the attire is not washed after each use, so one might feel uncomfortable wearing those skirts. One size for men!
The Mallorcan cuisine, like that from similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (particularly pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and all available ingredients such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All main words besides the word 'Sie' for 'Dir' always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
That is a very important opportunity to distinguish between a few verbs and objects.
It probably simplifies reading, although writing is a bit complicated due to the necessity of figuring out whether a verb or adjective is used in a nominalized form.
The pronunciation is relatively simple in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Make sure to pronounce 'r' and 'rr' differently: 'caro' means 'dear', but 'carro' means 'car'.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Reading this grammar book would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
Needless to say, if you know a Romance language, it becomes easier to learn Portuguese.
But people who speak little Spanish might mistakenly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it does not need to be studied separately.
Former observatories are nowadays typically closed and preserved as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution was not as much of a problem in its heyday as it is nowadays, they were usually located in cities or on campuses and were easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are giant facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of cherry blossoms, called Hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the chosen flower.
In Japan, the emperor held the first cherry blossom festivals exclusively for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally laid-out garden, you will also be thrown out without discussion if you collect "specimens."
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to live, very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost everything upon arrival.
However, because it is located in the "high tropics," only a few degrees north of the equator, you have to contend with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are also a few buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Roads suitable for bathing can be a good theme to plan a vacation around.
You can, for example, visit the castles in the Loire valley or the Rhine valley, book a cruise to interesting places on the Danube or a boat tour on the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling paths.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake at an exposed point to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may indeed be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturdays during the Easter weekend, where communities often celebrate the Resurrection of Christ at the stroke of midnight.
All animals that originally came to the island either swam, flew, or drifted on water.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were not able to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the first grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since humans set foot on the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctica in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
That provides a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as the sky is more or less dark around the clock.
Because the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is often not an issue, you are also able to enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and more formal than what people from the West are used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and employees address each other by their last name or job title.
The harmony in the workplace is crucial and emphasizes the efforts of the group instead of praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to obtain approval for all decisions they make from their superiors, and they are expected to follow their superior's instructions without asking questions.
