To date, there is one test vaccination that reduces deaths from Ebola, but to date no drugs have yet shown clear suitability for the treatment of an existing infection.
One antibody medication, ZMapp, initially promised progress in the field, but formal studies have shown that it offers fewer benefits than desired in preventing deaths.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, which means that scientists use it as a baseline and compare three other treatments with it.
USA Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee’s letter and endorses the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.

It not only confirms that there were at least some dinosaurs that had feathers, which is already a widespread theory, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's feathers are chestnut on top with a drab or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, also known as the rachis, but they have other characteristics of feathers - shaft filaments and side branches with barbs - and the researchers inferred that the rachis might have been a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The feather structure suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers propose that, even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows mature feathers and not a chick's down.
The researchers suggested that even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not chick down.

The work being done is mostly theoretical, but the program is written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts an attraction on the Earth, causing the tides, so does the Milky Way exert an attraction on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that the dark matter influences other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most dark matter in a galaxy is found in a type of halo, and consists of many small particles.

In France, voting was a traditionally low technology experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, and then place a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After the official confirmed the voter's identity, the voter dropped the envelope into the ballot box and signed the voter list.
French electoral legislation has quite strictly codified these proceedings.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that there were no envelopes at the beginning of the election and that no envelopes are added except those that are counted and from registered voters.
Candidates can send representatives to follow each part of the process. In the evenings, votes are counted by volunteers under heavy supervision, according to specific procedures.

Her other race, the Giant Slalom, saw her finish in tenth place in the women's sitting group with a combined run time of 4:41.30, 2:11:60 minutes slower than the first-place athlete, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09:02 minutes slower than the ninth-place athlete, Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's group failed to complete their runs, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to place in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phones.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five persons who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police superintendent, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, said that the accused appeared in court with covered faces.
Although three people were in the house when the car impacted it, none of them were injured.
Therefore, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court for the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting her charge and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be influenced because her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish legal systems operate differently, and courts have viewed the publication of the photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that "journalists cross a dangerous line if they publish photos etc. of suspects."
Crown Office, which is in overall control of prosecutions, indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made, at least until charge.
The document will, according to the informant, refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other subjects reportedly covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a continued military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to allow such a presence for only five years.
Rangers closely supervised the shooters in the supplementary pest control trial, as the trial was monitored and effectiveness evaluated.
In collaboration with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O’Flynn, the Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage of the NPWS, the four selected shooters for the first shooting operation received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new Provincial Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEO as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the lack of elections, some of which have been overdue since 2011.
Around 60 cases of faulty iPods that overheated were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
METI announced last week that Apple informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "non-serious."
The minister's office responded by calling Apple's delay of the report "truly a pity."
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management office declared that no damage has been reported in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there is no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been reported dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, as well as Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman as she needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He studied to be an obstetrician and started working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that if hormones are administered, it will accelerate the baby's fetal lung development.
Xinhua reports that the state's investigation team recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extremes. My first manager Luna died on the night of two moons. Very unique just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels commented that “Luna was just as strange as I am… maybe even more… love her and will miss her… hopefully she is in a better place.”
Of the 1,400 previous voters from the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, claimed during the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 Percent of those in the poll share this view, they want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist had to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle, and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness was brought into question.
He could not use the medicine he needed to overcome his pain because it is banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware or software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may possibly deliver a source of water to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth was formed, since comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriages.
He referred to the rumors as political chatter and folly.
People speculate that he is going to make an attempt in the presidential election in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FLA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of liters of fuel annually, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to track the aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport is available, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and drop-off facilities are not available on the ground.
Fears of a loss of transport have increased the possibility that the game will have to be played behind closed doors and without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the species adapted in only two generations, even though this process was believed to take much longer, due to breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes. It can also be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn out into a thin wire, which can be twisted or braided. It can be hammered out or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and pasted onto other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical agent. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen (the H in pH) ions in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which the electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then press them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, it will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, and it was attached to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remnants of drainage systems have been found in houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and sight.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope into outer space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel has given us is much easier and faster transport.
It brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Among them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey such as hares and bucks.
Lastly, there are many small kittens (including stray pet cats) that eat far more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, each cat has a special job that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups known as prides.
Lion prides consist of one to three related males, together with as many as thirty females and cubs.
The women are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave very much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly close to lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (even if not well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a sense of shrill screaming words.
Small wildcats like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the wildcat hunts are smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate animals (prey) by scent. They sniff the ground to determine where the animals have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and also move unseen. Leopard cats hunt their prey by blending with the surroundings and then pouncing on their victims.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) is removed from the main population where they come from (such as when they move over a mountain range or a river, or when they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
The new environment has different resources and other competition, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than they previously needed to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed much, they still require the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population began to adapt to their new environment, they began to look less and less like the other populations.
Ultimately, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will differ so much that they cannot even be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which just means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people inhale, and they absorb carbon dioxide that people exhale (that is, breathe out).
Plants make their own food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We use plants to build our houses and to make clothes. Most food that we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to live.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of the food chain of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jaw has more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of his mouth, which means there is no chance of escape for anything that crosses his path.
We do not know for sure, but he could have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex would not stand a chance against it.
While much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feasts that included wild boar, peacock, snail, and a type of marsupial known as a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the women ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men preferred to hold banquets together where they lay on their sides and ate their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included food that came to Europe from America or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was regarded as the home of the deity.
People would bring offerings to the gods, and the priests would try to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner chamber where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, also known as ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top side of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family happened in the open air.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were just open counters looking out onto the street. Stones were used to build the house.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. In Norse sagas, it is told that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the film National Treasure, you might think that there is a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Nevertheless, it is not true. Even though there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". The text appears upside down, at the bottom of the document.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
So, it is possible that the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that subsequently broke out freed the north of France, but still the South was not free.
It was controlled by the "Vichy" French. They were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On the 15th of August 1944, the Allies invaded Southern France, the invasion was known as "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the American and French forces liberated the south of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people who collaborate and live and work as a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or like a city, and it also defines the size of the society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture expands by transferring knowledge across many generations, a continuous cultural footprint, and fair distribution.
Smaller cultures regularly disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government – with Congress as its only component – under the Articles of Confederation.
The congress did not have the power to enforce taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, they relied on the state authorities, who often did not want to cooperate, to carry out all their acts.
It also had no authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles require unanimous consent of all the states before they can be changed, and the states take the central government so lightly that their representatives were frequently absent.
Italy's national soccer team, along with the German national soccer team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the FIFA World Cup winners in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the Northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago" due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has.
Taiwan began long ago in the 15th century when European sailors passed by to record the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan and initiated a transformation in native grain production practices by employing Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
Qing dynasty (1644 – 1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which they transferred sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the ridges of the complex have already been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size by the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly, the aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore 3: 2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are equivalent to or closely estimated to this aspect ratio.
The often-abused and frequently mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates movement while maintaining some degree of order in an image.
It says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the picture vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was placed under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian faith bound European states together despite language and cultural differences.
The all-pervasive power of it affected everyone; from the king to the community members.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the financial resources of the church are there specifically for this purpose.
For more than a thousand years, the central authority of the church has been in Rome, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question this premise.
Shortly after the outbreak of riots, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective; it cut off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international laws through various international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering large parts of the ocean, which would mean danger even for neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each stage of China or each family in control was a separate dynasty.
There was also an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty. The most well-known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period which occurred in the 60 years between the Han and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods, there was severe warfare among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in Ancient Chinese history; with thousands of people dying in the struggle to sit on the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
After the Revolution, professions were also open to male applicants, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military, since military ranks are now based on caliber rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in events beyond this earthly life. He regularly visited a cave that became known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) for reflection.
The cave itself, which has survived for a long time, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world, and rests atop one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In truth, it is not easy to find, even if one knew it existed. When one is in a cave, it is complete isolation.
Nothing but the clean, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains can be seen. Very little of this world can be heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramid structures constructed to honor the death of the Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramids were created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upturn" mark looks like a V and the "downturn" mark looks like a staple or a small square without its bottom side.
"Up means that you start at the tip and push the bow, and down means that you start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow."
An up-bow usually creates a softer sound, while a down-bow is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to write in your own notes, but remember that the printed bar lines are there for a musical reason, so they usually need to be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced to flee back to Paris from Versailles on the 6th of October 1789, by a crowd of market women.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris while surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and yelling threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
At one point, a member of the protesters swung the head of a royal who had been killed at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The costs of war from U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid in advance by the Filipino people themselves.
They are obliged to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to settle a large part of the expenses, and the interest on bonds was channeled through the Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super profits obtained from the extended exploitation of the Filipino people would form the basic profits of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Temple Servants, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that involves a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological push or the technological necessity in a strict sense that human fate is driven by an underlying logic coupled with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, produces "effects" on society that are intrinsic rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the motor car necessarily led to the development of roads.
A nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a handful of cars, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass vehicle ownership also leads to accidents on the road, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for the repair of damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a large element of cultural determinism, taken from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, the physical environment shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture emerged that were connected to that environment, and these things, which are in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
The fame of being an epicenter of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
The status declined during the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, whose value was higher than what Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
The attire was initially strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
Due to the slow communication channels, styles in the West can lag behind by 25 to 30 per year.
Closer to the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop their own style. One of the greatest developments of the time was due to the Crusades, when people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming done to produce just enough food to satisfy the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that combines preserved seed indigenous to the ecoregion with crop rotation or other relatively easy techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers have been involved in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Individuals with similar feelings of neglect by community standards are brought together by subcultures and allowed to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinctive due to the members' age, ethnic origin, status, location, and/or gender.
The characteristics that clearly define a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of styles, which includes fashions, manners, and informal language.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is by focusing on the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, adverse circumstances or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults while the children were growing up.
Such children are labeled as "runaways" or wild. Some wild children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment is attributed to parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical limitations.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
It is claimed that others were raised by animals; some stayed on their own in the wilderness.
When a wild child is entirely raised by non-human animals, it exhibits behavior (within physical limits) that is almost entirely like that of the specific nurturing animal, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make it easier and more interesting to learn, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a tool that provides support to individuals who begin using a new learning method, such as a new computer program or the start of a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual or real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are in the software and are meant to question, accelerate, and clarify procedures for students who would find the process difficult to handle on their own.
Children are placed in Foster Care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even to exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but that is the reality.
We see the Foster Care system as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the uses and gratifications approach.
For example, “learning” and “socializing” are suggested as important motivations for Internet use ( James et al., 1995).
When Eighmey and McCord (1998) researched audience responses to websites, they identified “Personal involvement” and “ongoing relationships” as new motivational aspects.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretations of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is mentioned that one can detect when a person is lying by correctly interpreting the micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks indicated in his document, The President's Speech, how people who were unable to understand the speech due to brain damage were nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggested that such abilities to interpret human behavior are shared by animals like domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation process adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix variation back and forth between the two pools of each generation.
On the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs with the plants available there.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant sources would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but it is difficult for primates like us to digest, unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they offer high quality protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their own “protein problem” in a manner similar to the way some chimpanzees on the savanna do today.
The interruption of sleep is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and then falling asleep again shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
It can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself setting the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, which forces one to get up so you can urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses correlates with the amount of tension in a person's body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force that is present. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve relief. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but is expanded through the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The focal point of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War 2, led by the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, and clashes of system, process, and culture, which led to the countries falling out.
Within two years after the end of the war, former allies were current enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It was the last for the next 40 years and would truly be fought, by standby troops, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Roman bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after they entered the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The work of the fleets was traditionally to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic expedition of WWII. The Americans attempted to get troops and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, which mostly used U-boats, tried to stop the traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain as it was able to conquer the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were commonly kept in herds that roamed the hills and other grazing areas, and were looked after by goat herders who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more well-known shepherds. These methods of tending are still used today.
Waspore was built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagonways mostly consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that pulled them to do so at greater speeds and with larger loads than it would take to do so on the almost rougher roads of the day.
Crossbeams were installed quite early to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the tracks would be more efficient if there was an iron strip at the top.
It has become common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first pure iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking; people began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means upright human).
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not normally walk upright.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 - 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus was already walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more kindly towards the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to combat future suffering to some extent.
It's just like the symptomatic treatment in many cases. Be that as it may, if we are not seeking only a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems, and we must neutralize them.
It is clear enough that the world has changed significantly due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and problems have become greater due to overpopulation and humanity's excessive lifestyle.
After the adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to the printing house of John Dunlap.
Through the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on the grounds of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist are known as the oldest copies of the document that still exist. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are common enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning might be the presence of an open container of medication or household chemicals.
Look at the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for the group of insects.
The term is derived from an ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects that are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both Assassin bugs and Bed bugs are nidicolous, adapted to live in a nest or home of their host.
Across the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the largest neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research finds that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the interest of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to establish an adoption plan for their baby.
With an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parenthood so that another couple may adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through a scientific method. This method guides most scientific research factually.
Although it is not alone, experimentation, and an experiment in a test that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions, and to make observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, are accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found themselves cut off from their Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed rhythms in physiology, and behavior is often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only responses to external periodic signals, have been recorded for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will maintain a period of free-running cycles, even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main proposals that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments that either labeled the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are germ-line cells.
Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other places can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the environment, including the plant and animal life.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studies of information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit Borneo and learn about orangutans and photograph them.
Every morning people leave the small towns in cars to go to their workplaces and are passed by others whose workplace is the area they have just left.
In this dynamic shuttle, everyone is in some way connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
The science indicates that this massive carbon economy has affected the biosphere's stable conditions that have supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, a study of traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave within a reasonably consistent range; and thus traffic flows have a reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the 3 main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of roadway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them avoid their enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage that they are able to fold their wings back onto their bodies.
It offers them a wider variety of small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believe the opposite; that the Solar System moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems sensible, because the Earth doesn't feel as if it is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at times six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water flowing from the planet's rivers into oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid-building in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
New Kingdom ancient Egyptians were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the daily language used by many who work in states where Latin is regularly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, and these can all be found in nature in their basic form and are relatively simple to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements, namely earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he has a theory that they can change into new forms that we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Naturally, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There can also be alloys that contain small amounts of non-metal elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit in that point at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many when it came out.
Unfortunately, the status and use of the pencil have decreased as newer writing methods have been used.
People now write messages on screen displays and do not need to come near a sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's almost like pushing a heavy wagon up a hill. The splitting of a nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they break apart with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the oceans and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around what motivates or pleases people.
These theories assume that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature.
These theories examine what it is about certain people that causes them to want the things they do and the things in their environment that cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, two types of behavior may emerge when managers start leading their former colleagues. One side of the spectrum is to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, to carry out disciplinary actions, to evaluate employee performance, to assign responsibilities, and to hold employees accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, a person changes into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything the team was doing and make it their own.
The leader is after all responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often causes a break between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They regularly have more autonomy than conventional team members as their teams meet across different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a visual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization go through such a time-consuming process to establish a learning organization? One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can come through.
As a result, the process of an organization works together to overcome the obstacle and it can lead to a new innovation process to serve the client's needs.
Leadership must create a culture of creation, as well as shared knowledge and organized study before an organization can be innovative.
Angel (2006) explained the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Thus, it narrows the research area and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injuries, traumas, tears, and tumors affect behavior and in some cases alter some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes like never before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models to help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong connotation with science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, which deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer client diagnoses and questions as well as handwriting recognition, voice and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now regularly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military units, and is also integrated into various home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. A teacher often wants to take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology provides the solution with virtual field trips. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual outing is also a good way to reflect on an outing and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; the website is remodeled every year, but old versions are kept online and serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing abilities. While students often start their blog experience with messy language and spelling, the presence of observers usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to pursue improved writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging "forces students to become more skilled about the world around them." The necessity to feed the interest of the crowd inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
A blog is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to take learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' writings, as well as develop their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and features a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and the north houses the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and the surrounding area.
All these things and more characterize Ontario as genuinely Canadian as perceived by outsiders.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the USA than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean near the east coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent in its own right.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the countries, and it took a strong hold in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, as the explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (as long as it's one that doesn't look expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences might cause them to feel harassed, and that it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when you turn men away, and don't be afraid to stand up for your rights (Cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it again after the earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the less interesting stores to shop at in the whole of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as Moroccan cooking pots, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole spectrum of excesses, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the town's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside Goma should be researched to understand the state of fighting continuing in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point to climb the Nyiragongo volcano, along with the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to explore Goma. The normal (local) price is ~ 500 Congolese Francs for the short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is now used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway places.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished town, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger due to the threats of the desert sands.
It was one of the principal stopovers during Henry Louis Gates's special PBS program, Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, because it has more of an Arabian flair than that of an African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeastern part of South Africa and follows the border of Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and it is regarded as the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and access fees for the park.
It may also be beneficial to buy a “Wild Card” that grants access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all the South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the area of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a dazzling column chart, accented by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best skyline of Hong Kong, leave the island and travel to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonizers took for themselves and so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world and extends 80 km (50 miles) inland of the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest that falls within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only halophytic marshes - they include some of the last remaining stands of mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which about one-third is covered in water/swamp areas.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now approximately 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading in an eastern direction, leave for Jakar/Bumthang between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is suggested that one buys a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese Coaster Buses, which are reliable and sturdy.
Shared rental cars are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paru (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters and are 378 meters long and have two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not open for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most remarkable indigenous group that inhabited the area now known as Eastern Paraguay, and they occupied the area as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other native tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering food, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Great Province of the Indies," was born as a result of the skirmishes between Spanish conquerors and the local indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began the period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the creation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, look at the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official Falkland currency is the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds will be widely accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley credit cards and United States dollars are also frequently accepted.
In the remote islands, credit cards will most likely not be accepted, although British and United States currencies will be taken; ask the owners in advance to determine what the accepted payment method would be.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
The winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures barely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity together make it feel colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, nature is nonetheless wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, stay at least 100 meters away from bears, wolves, and 25 meters from all other wild animals.
It doesn't matter how tame they seem, buffalo, deer, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year thousands of visitors are injured because they did not keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying around or cooking fragrant food and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was established in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British warship. Almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town caused the death of Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to the fact that Auckland stretches across two harbors. The most popular ones are in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in North Harbour district) are against the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming spots, and most have shaded areas provided by the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good range of shops along the edge of the beach. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One', it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines available, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be better transported.
The local tap water is quite safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are concerned.
For Australians, the idea of 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A short black is 'espresso', cappuccino is served topped with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is on par with Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips are undertaken to the coral reefs throughout the year, and injuries on the coral reef due to any of these causes are rare.
However, take advice from authorities, obey all notices, and heed safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside these times.
Sharks exist, but very rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actually live in the ocean, their primary habitat is in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that they will have somewhere to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, so you may find it impossible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport arrangements to/from the airport, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservations for you if you need time to think about the offer or to get other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or inquiries must, however, go through the travel agent and not directly through the hotel.
For some music festivals, most of the attendees decide to camp on-site, and most see it as an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will need to arrive early to get a camping spot near the music.
Remember that although music on the main stages might come to an end, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
When crossing the Northern Baltic region in the winter, ensure the hut's location, as it causes a lot of noise for those most affected by going through the ice.
Saint Petersburg boat trips include time in the town. Trip passengers are exempt from visa requirements (make sure of the terms).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits may be difficult to find.
To stick to their premise and to keep guests in a good mood, they usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks. However, intoxication affects your judgment, and all good gamblers realize the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive over mountain passes at high latitudes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or temperatures below freezing.
Friction on icy and snowy roads is very low, and you cannot drive as if you are on a bare tar road.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall quickly in a short time to trap you.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or wind-driven snow or by the condensation of ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The popular term safari, which is commonly used, refers to overland travel to see the beautiful African wildlife, especially on savannas.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to come too close to cars and standard equipment will allow good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "walking safari," or going "for a walk") consists of a walk lasting from a few hours to a few days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the declaration was announced, you may have a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but from late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to June 2020 when the Olympic Games are scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
By ironing damp clothes, they dry more quickly. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available to borrow, even if there isn't one in the room.
If an iron is not available or you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful that the fabric does not become too hot (otherwise it can shrink or, in extreme cases, be scorched).
There are various ways to purify water, some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, in others a few minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have concerns, you should consider purchasing your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are not known in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Contagious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people violently, do not usually qualify as plagues.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise at certain locations.
Travelers to countries with heavy taxes can sometimes save a significant amount, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, where it regularly ventures into desolate inland terrain.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, keep your distance: steep grades, narrow lanes, and sharp curves prevail.
Speed limits are notably lower than in previous and subsequent sections – usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is even more important than otherwise.
Strangely enough, the cell service here is better than many other parts of the route, e.g., the Pennsylvania Wilds.

Stirrups are for supporting the rider's feet, which hang down on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability for the rider but may pose safety risks due to the possibility that the rider's feet could get stuck in them.
If a horse throws off the rider and his foot gets stuck in the stirrup, he can be dragged along if the horse runs away. To reduce the risk, there are various safety measures that can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup's strap to fall off the saddle if it is pulled backward by a falling rider.

Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational skiing club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski tours: This activity can also be called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related to it, but does not include alpine ski touring or mountaineering, the latter being done on steep terrain and requiring stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski route as similar to a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you will cover somewhat greater distances than by walking – but only very rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack in neat tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would have meant going through visa applications and passport control points multiple times.
The Schengen area, nevertheless, works somewhat like one country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
By having a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for each of the Schengen member countries separately, thereby saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for which manufactured items are antiques or not. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antique.

Courier companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Quite often time is very important when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or replacement parts for an urgent repair.
The larger companies had their own planes on some routes, but for the other routes and smaller firms, this was a problem.
If they send these items by air freight, unloading and customs on some routes can take days.
The only way to get through this quicker was to send it as checked baggage. Airlines' regulations will not allow them to send baggage without a passenger, so this is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class is to pay a large sum of money for the privilege (or better yet - get your company to do it for you).
Therefore, it is however not cheap: as a rough rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal rate for economy and eleven times for first class!
Generally, there is no point in even looking for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay top dollar for the privilege of getting to a destination quickly and in comfort, and their bill reflects this accordingly.
