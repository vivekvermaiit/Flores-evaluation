This confirms the already widespread theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provided information not usually found in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
According to the researchers, the animal's plumage was chestnut brown on top and light or carotenoid-colored underneath.
Additionally, the finding helps to understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the feathers of the dinosaur do not have a well-developed shaft called the rachis, but they do have other feather characteristics—such as barbs and barbules—scientists concluded that the rachis is likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying but for thermoregulation or courtship displays. Although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the researchers proposed that the sample originated from the plumage of an adult individual rather than the down of a juvenile.
Even though it was a young dinosaur's tail, researchers claimed the specimen came from the plumage of an adult individual and not from the down of a juvenile.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at the main police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty people.

They found out that the Sun follows the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in their system was found to be due to luminosity and rotation and orbital movement, not anything else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less frequently polarity reversals occur in the star.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team hoped to observe the tidal effects between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the gravitational pull of the moon affects the Earth, causing the tides, so too does the gravitational pull of the Milky Way affect the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy.
Researchers were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the galaxy's dark matter surrounds it like a kind of halo and consists of a large number of small particles.

Based on infrared images, the temperature variations over a day indicate that they are likely caves.
They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as uniform as in the Earth's large caves, where a fairly consistent temperature often prevails, but it is consistent with them being deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing, a member of the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) astrogeology team and a teacher at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
Traditionally, voting in France has not been high-tech: voters go into a booth and place a pre-printed paper strip in an envelope, on which they have marked their chosen candidate.
After the authorities have verified the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral legislation has relatively precisely dictated the course of events.
In 1988, ballot boxes were required to be transparent so that voters and observers could verify that there were no envelopes in the box at the start of the voting and that no envelopes other than officially counted and authorized votes were added to the box.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the sequence of events. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision and in accordance with prescribed procedures.

In addition to Wednesday's competition, Carpanedo participated in two other individual events at the World Championships.
The first of them was the slalom, where his first run was unfinished. 36 out of 116 participants also failed to reach the finish line.
In her second competition, the giant slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting category with a combined time of 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 slower than the time of Austria's Claudia Loesch who came first, and 1:09.02 slower than that of Hungary's Gyöngyi Dani who finished in ninth place.
Four skiers in the women's sitting group were unable to finish their run, and 45 out of 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom did not place in the competition.
The police in Madhya Pradesh found a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: "We have arrested five individuals who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused have been named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in the courtroom with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road on which the collision occurred was temporarily closed as the rescue service freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been accused in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court of murdering her son.
He is in custody awaiting prosecution and trial, but eyewitness evidence may be compromised as his picture has been widely published.
The practice is common elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish legal system operates differently, and the courts have considered that publishing images may be detrimental to an impartial trial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee states that "journalists do seem to be balancing dangerously if they publish photos of suspects, etc."
The Crown Office, the prosecuting authority in Scotland which holds general responsibility for charges, has indicated to journalists that the matter will not be commented on further, at least before prosecution.
According to the leak, the document refers to a border dispute in which Palestine wants the borders to run as they did before the 1967 Middle East war.
According to the information, other topics discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuing military presence in the valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement. The Palestinian Authority accepts such a presence for only five years.
The forest rangers were tasked with closely supervising the shooters participating in the pest control trial, as the experiment was being monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
Volunteers who met the requirements were recruited as a joint project of the National Park and Wildlife Service and the New South Wales division of the Australian Shooters Association, as part of the shooters' association's hunting program.
According to Mick O’Flynn, the acting director of NPWS in charge of park conservation and cultural heritage, the four shooters selected for the initial shootings received comprehensive safety and training guidance.
Martelly acknowledged nine members in yesterday's provisional electoral council (CEP) meeting.
It is Martelly's fifth interim electoral council in four years.
The delegation appointed by the president recommended last month that the previous interim election council resign as part of a package of measures aimed at moving the country towards new elections.
The delegation was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
Occasionally violent protests originated from the unfulfilled elections, some of which were supposed to be held as early as 2011.
Overheating incidents of malfunctioning iPods have been reported in about 60 cases, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan said that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the ministry announced that Apple had informed it of 34 other overheating incidents, which the company described as "non-serious."
The ministry responded by calling the delay of the investigation conducted by Apple "really unfortunate."
An earthquake struck the Marianas at 7:19 local time (Friday at 21:19 Greenwich Mean Time).
It was stated by the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency that no damages had been reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no indications of a tsunami forming.
A former Filipino police officer has held Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in the Philippines' capital, Manila.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with an M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and so far at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, among them children and the elderly, were released ahead of schedule as were the Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of an elderly woman when she needed to use the toilet. Mendoza died in the shooting.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature birth during his free time.
His research showed that administering the hormone accelerates the development of the fetus's lungs.
Xinhua reported that an official investigation team found two black boxes, or flight recorders, on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also showed respect to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna passed away during the night of two moons. A pretty unique case just like herself. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was as crazy as I am... maybe even more... I love her and will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Before the federal parliamentary elections in 2010, a survey of 1,400 respondents was conducted. The number of those opposed to becoming the Republic of Australia had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Prime Minister of the caretaker government, Julia Gillard, claimed during the 2010 federal parliamentary election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the survey participants shared his view and wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic champion was supposed to participate in the Commonwealth Games' 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle and three relay races, but their condition has been uncertain due to pain.
He has not been able to take the medication needed for pain relief, because their use is prohibited in competitions.
Professor of computer science, mathematician Curtis Cooper from the University of Central Missouri discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people had confirmed the discovery by the beginning of February using different devices and software, and it was reported on Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water to Earth as well as organic matter, which can form proteins and support life.
Researchers hope to understand how planets are formed, and particularly how Earth was formed, as comets collided with Earth long ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo's term as governor began earlier this year, and he signed a bill last month that legalizes same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political jaw-flapping and ridiculous."
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
The United States aviation authority claims that NextGen is a system that allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older, ground-based radar technology. This allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more reliable information.
No additional transport will be arranged, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking and park-and-ride services are also not available at the venue.
Concern over the lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team’s supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported the development of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University and Uppsala University reported that a new species had evolved in just two generations, although the process was believed to take much longer. The reason was the interbreeding between the native Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortis) and the newcomer species, the cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can also be rolled into very small objects.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and it can be attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was once used in hand-painted pictures in books, called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make a gauge yourself using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the substance is.
The number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical indicates the pH value.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which the electrons have been removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix both dry powders together and then squeeze them into a ball with clean, damp hands.
The moisture of your hands reacts with the outermost layer, which feels strange and forms a sort of crust.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a complex sewage system.
Remnants of drainage systems have been found in the Minoan cities of Greece on Crete and Santorini.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were also toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where women and men bathed together in the same facilities.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite located in space receives a call and then reflects it back almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space aboard a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
A giant rocket over 100 feet long is needed to take a satellite or telescope into space.
The bicycle has transformed the world in incredible ways. Much easier and faster movement is the greatest thing the bicycle has done for us.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them come the medium-sized felines, which prey on medium-sized game ranging from hares to antelopes and deer.
Then there are also many small felines (including stray pet cats) that eat small prey animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds, whose numbers are much greater.
The secret to their success is the so-called ecological niche. According to this concept, each feline has its own special role, which is why it does not compete with others.
Lions are the most social big cats, and they live in large groups called prides.
The herds consist of one to three adult males that are related to each other and sometimes up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave in much the same way as wolf or dog packs. These animals resemble lions surprisingly much in their behavior (but not other large felines), and they too are very dangerous to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (although not very well), swim, jump far, and pull five times as powerfully as a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same genus of big cats (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. Only these four cats can roar.
The roar of a tiger does not resemble the full-bodied roar of a lion, but rather a sentence composed of grunted, shouted words.
Ocelots gladly eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can catch them. Almost all the animals hunted by an ocelot are much smaller than itself.
Researchers believe that ocelots track and find edible animals, that is, prey, based on scent by sniffing the ground where they have traveled.
Ocelots see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision and move very stealthily. They hunt by blending into their environment and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or a river to a new island, making it difficult to move back), its environment is often different than before.
The resources of the new environment are different and the competitors are different, so to be a strong competitor, the new population needs different traits or adaptations than before.
The original population has not changed at all; it still requires the same adaptations as before.
When a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, over time it starts to resemble the main population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, each population looks so different from one another that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of a new species. Speciation is a necessary consequence of evolution and an important part of it.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in, and they use carbon dioxide that people breathe out.
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. Additionally, they provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
Mosasaurus was a top predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
In its long jaws were over 70 razor-sharp teeth, and in addition, it had an extra row of teeth in its palate, so nothing that crossed its path could escape.
We are not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that came into the water. Even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus rex would not have stood a chance against it.
Most of their food would be familiar to us, but the Romans also had their own peculiar or unusual celebration dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate their food sitting in a chair, while the rich preferred to organize communal feasts where they reclined on their sides while eating their meals.
In ancient Roman meals, such food could not be served that came to Europe from America or Asia only in later centuries.
They did not have, for example, corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and not a single ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People brought offerings to the gods, and the priests sought to fulfill the needs of the gods with ceremonies and celebrations.
Every temple had an open inner courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, the so-called Holy of Holies, which only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes pyramidal towers were built in temples, called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary of God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house was not as important.
Most of the life of a Hebrew family was spent outdoors.
The women cooked outside, and the shops were just open stalls along the streets. Stone was used as the building material for the houses.
There were no extensive forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled. According to the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and while traveling west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living on the island at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776," are written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The writing is upside-down at the bottom of the document.
No one knows for sure who wrote them, but it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 29 ¾ inches by 24 ½ inches) was rolled up in the early days for storage.
It is therefore likely that the entry was added merely as a kind of name tag.
D-Day, or the landings and the subsequent battles, had liberated Northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was in the hands of what is known as Vichy France, meaning the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders rather than fought against them.
The Allies invaded Southern France on August 15, 1944. The code name for the operation was Operation Dragoon.
The United States and Free French forces liberated southern France in just two weeks and turned toward Germany.
Civilization is a culture shared by a large group of people living and working together collaboratively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word "civilis," which means civilian or citizen. It is related to the Latin word "civis," which means citizen or subject, and "civitas," which means city or city-state, and it somewhat also defines the size of a society.
The city-states are predecessors of nations. Civilizational culture refers to the transfer of knowledge from multiple generations to another, a long-term cultural footprint, and a fairly widespread distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving necessary historical evidence, so they are generally not regarded as true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, thirteen states first formed a weak central government—whose only component was the Congress—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and as there was no national executive authority or judiciary, it had to rely on often uncooperative state authorities for the enforcement of all its regulations.
It also did not have the authority to change tax laws and tariffs between states.
Changing the articles required unanimous approval from all the states, and the states regarded the central government so dismissively that often their representatives were not present.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful in the world alongside the German national team. It won the football World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in northern regions, and Italians compete in them even in international matches and the Olympics.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the seventh-largest island in the world!
Because the islands of Japan are in a cluster or group, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in a geographical sense.
Taiwan began to be known as far back as the 15th century, when European sailors passing by mentioned the island using the name Ilha Formosa, which means beautiful island.
The Dutch East India Company established a base in Southwest Taiwan in 1624. At the same time, it initiated a change in the indigenous population's grain production methods and hired Chinese workers for its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing dynasty in 1885.
After experiencing defeat in the first Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) in 1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: these are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976, and the restoration continues even now.
For example, the most common size used in still photography worldwide is 35 mm. It was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced, but above all, the aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Somewhat confusingly, the 35-millimeter size is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
That is why the aspect ratio of this size (when divided by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format family) either match or are very close to this aspect ratio.
The often misused and much mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating dynamism in an image while still maintaining some degree of order.
According to it, the most effective place for the main subject is at the point where the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally intersect (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, began to be closely scrutinized.
Christianity had united the states of Europe for over a thousand years despite the differences in languages and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone, both kings and commoners alike.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's funds are meant for precisely such use.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and wealth led many to question the implementation of the doctrine.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective in cutting off crucial supply deliveries to soldiers and civilians, even though the blockade violated the generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements over the past two hundred years.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from accessing entire ocean areas and posed a danger even to neutral vessels.
Since the tactic elicited only limited reactions, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and states were pacifism and isolationism.
The nations, having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, decided to avoid a similar situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former supervisor) to Thomas Edison.
In Ancient China, there was a unique way to describe different periods: each phase or ruling family was its own dynasty.
In addition, between each dynasty there was a period of unstable division of provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, many nobles fought fiercely in their pursuit of the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died fighting for access to sit on the highest seat of the magnificent palace in Xi’an.
There were many social and political consequences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from autocracy to republicanism, the nationalistic idea, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
After the revolution, official positions were also opened to all male applicants. Thus, the most ambitious and successful could thrive.
The same applied to the army, as military ranks were now based on competence instead of class status.
The French Revolution also inspired oppressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond everyday life. He often went to meditate in a cave that became known as Hira and was located on the Mountain of Light, called Nur.
The cave itself, which the ravages of time left untouched, creates a very vivid impression of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on one of the mountains rising north of Mecca, and it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is very difficult to find, even if you know it exists. Once inside the cave, the isolation is complete.
Only a clear, beautiful sky above and many surrounding mountains can be seen. From inside the cave, very little of the earthly world can be seen or heard.
Located on the Giza Plateau, or the Necropolis of Giza, in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, are several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BCE, is one of the many large pyramid-shaped structures made in honor of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the Giza Necropolis, located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The rising bow mark looks like the letter V and the falling bow mark is like a staple or a square missing the underscore.
Ascending bow means that you should start from the tip and push the bow. Descending means that you should start from the frog (the part where you hold the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
A rising bow usually produces a softer sound, a descending bow is stronger and firmer.
Feel free to add your own markings with a pencil, but remember that the printed articulation marks are in the sheet music for musical reasons, so they should generally be followed.
A crowd of working women forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister Elisabeth from Versailles back to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in carriages, surrounded by the crowd shouting threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage fully.
At some point, someone from the crowd waved the head of a bodyguard killed at Versailles in front of the shocked queen.
The Filipinos had to pay themselves for the war costs caused by the conquest of the Philippines to American imperialism.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial administration, which covered a significant portion of the costs, and to take care of the interest on bonds issued by the Philippine government on behalf of Wall Street banks.
The fundamental benefit of American imperialism was, of course, the huge profits obtained from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipinos.
To understand the Knights Templar, one needs to understand the background against which the organization emerged.
The era of events is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history between the years 1000 and 1300 AD.
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and afterwards came the Late Middle Ages, which is generally considered to have ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that practically encompasses a wide variety of ideas about the so-called technological push, i.e., the necessity of technology, to such an absolute notion that human destiny is guided by logic based on scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two basic ideas: firstly, that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond the reach of cultural and political influence, and secondly, that technology in turn has inherent rather than socially conditioned "effects" on societies.
As an example, one could argue that the invention of the car inevitably leads to the development of roads.
On the other hand, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars results in more accidents on the road, leading to the invention of new healthcare methods to repair injured bodies.
Cultural determinism was a significant element in Romanticism, drawing from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography was seen as shaping individuals. Over time, customs and culture typical of this geographical location were formed. Because they were in harmony with society, they worked better than arbitrarily enacted laws.
Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe in the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around the year 400 AD and continued until about the year 1100.
Its position weakened in the 12th century mainly because the crusaders had returned home with gifts like silk and spices, which were valued more than what the Byzantine markets had to offer.
It was at that time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style was at its peak between the turn of the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, the clothes were strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
Due to slow communication channels, Western European styles could, however, be 25–30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. As one of the era's most significant developments, people began to use buttons to fasten clothes as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence farming is agriculture where enough food is produced only to support the farmer and their family.
A subsistence economy is a simple system, often based on organic farming, which uses seeds native to the eco-area combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel rejected by societal norms, and in this way, they can develop their own identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished based on age, ethnicity, social class, location, and/or the gender of the members.
Features that define a subculture as its own and distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, related to gender or sexuality, geographical, or combinations of several different factors.
Often, members of a subculture communicate their membership through a characteristic and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and their own slang.
One of the most common methods to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to use as an example those few unfortunate children who were deprived of the socialization provided by adults while growing up, either due to neglect, bad luck, or deliberate abuse.
Children like these are called "wild." Some children have been isolated by people (often their own parents). In some cases, the abandonment has been due to parents rejecting the child because of a severe intellectual or physical disability.
The wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are alleged to have been raised by animals, while some are said to have lived on their own in the wild.
If a feral child has been raised entirely by an animal other than a human, they behave (within their physical limitations) almost entirely in the same manner as their guardian animal, for example, by showing similar fear or indifference towards humans.
The purpose of project-based learning is to make learning easier and more engaging. Timely support (scaffolding) for learning takes it a step further.
Ladders are not a learning method, but a tool that supports individuals in a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Ladders can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a kind of ladder, but so is the little paperclip character in Microsoft Office.
The virtual ladders are built into the software, and their purpose is to pose questions, provide prompts, and explain procedures that might have been too challenging for the learner without anyone's assistance.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but some do.
We consider the foster care system a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system aims to provide a safe home, loving guardians, consistent education, and reliable healthcare.
The purpose of placing the children is to meet all of their basic needs that were lacking in their previous homes.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The special characteristics of the Internet imply additional dimensions in the case of the theory of use.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are presented as important influences for Internet use (James et al. 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as new perspectives on motives when studying audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
It has been specifically claimed that by correctly interpreting micro-expressions, it is possible to identify whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks described in his article The President's Speech how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that some animals, such as domestic dogs, might have similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research from the 20th century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: cryptic and expressed.
A mutation increases new genetic variation; selection removes it from the stock of manifested variations.
Segregation and recombination transfer variation back and forth between these two reservoirs with each generation.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of a human finds it difficult to obtain enough amino acids from the plants available on the savannah.
In addition, being deprived of them has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest accessible plant resources would have been proteins obtained from leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, it is difficult to digest them without cooking.
Instead, animal-based food (ants, termites, eggs) is easily digestible, and in addition, they provide ample amounts of proteins containing all essential amino acids.
Therefore, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" somewhat in the same way as the chimpanzees of the savannas do today.
Interrupting sleep means intentionally waking up during a normal sleep cycle and falling back asleep a little later (after 10–60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved by using a comparatively quiet alarm clock that restores consciousness but does not wake you up completely.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, which forces you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known as diuretics) before going to bed, which forces one to get out of bed to urinate.
The amount of a person's inner peace is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive his life force is. It is possible for everyone to find complete peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle to this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but the idea of Mahayana, or the great path, as well as many techniques of Indian yoga, were added to them.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini yoga, kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Visualizing deities purifies energy channels, activates chakras, and develops consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which is why the Soviet Union and the United States cooperated. After the war ended, clashes of systems, procedures, and cultures led to a break between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies had become enemies, leading to the Cold War.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and the war was fought for real, as proxy armies battled on the battlefields of Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were thwarted almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army advanced into the country and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after attacking the eastern parts of Poland. This was contrary to the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The traditional mission of navies has been to ensure that one's own country retains the ability to move its own people and goods while simultaneously disrupting the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans tried to move people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy mostly tried to block this traffic with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have succeeded in conquering Britain just like the rest of Europe.
The goats were apparently domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them to easily obtain milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were typically raised in herds that roamed over hilly terrain or other pastures. Often they were tended by goat herders, who were often children or young people, much like the more well-known shepherds. These herding methods are still in use today.
Carriage roads were built in England as early as the 1500s.
Although the cart paths consisted solely of parallel wooden planks, thanks to them horses were able to pull carriages more quickly and with larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Railroad ties were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was understood that the tracks would be more efficient if an iron strip was placed on top of them.
The practice became common, but iron wore down the wooden wheels of the carriages more.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron tracks were introduced.
The first known form of transportation was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago when Homo erectus (i.e., upright man) evolved.
The preceding Australopithecus did not walk upright as consistently.
Specialization in bipedalism is found in the 4.2–3.9 million-year-old fossils of Australopithecus, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to somewhat reduce future suffering.
This is often just like treating the symptoms of an illness, but if we do not want just a temporary solution, then we should find the roots of the problems and eliminate them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to mankind's scientific and technological advancements, and problems have increased due to overpopulation and mankind's wasteful lifestyle.
After Congress passed it on July 4th, a handwritten copy signed by the president of Congress, John Hancock, and secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printing office a few blocks away.
During the night, 150–200 copies were printed, which are now known as the Dunlap broadsides.
John Nixon read the document aloud publicly for the first time in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. One copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 surviving Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many of today's paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still lives. We call them birds.
Many do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there is much about birds that still looks like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like tyrannosaurs.
In practice, all currently used computers are based on processing data encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, namely either 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits – or in the professional language of computer circuits, bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms like vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The surest sign of internal poisoning is a visible, opened medicine bottle or a container of toxic household chemicals.
Check the first aid instructions related to the poison on the label.
Entomologists specifically use the term "bugs" for this group of insects.
The term stems from the fact that in ancient times, bedbugs were very common. Bedbugs are insects that are well-adapted to being parasites of humans.
Bed bugs and bat bugs are both nest-dwelling, adapted to living in their host's nest or shell.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis, or MS, in the United States, making it the most common neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
MS disease affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis compared to men.
A couple can decide that raising a child is not in their or their child's best interest.
These couples can, if they wish, create an adoption plan for their little one.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights, allowing another couple to act as the child's parents.
The main task of science is to determine, using scientific methods, how the world works. The scientific method indeed guides the majority of scientific research.
However, it is not only about conducting experiments, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science were accepted, including in the field of psychology.
As the knowledge of the Greek language declined in the West, it lost touch with its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physical structure and behavior often depend very essentially on the existence of intrinsic cycles and their emergence through biological clocks.
Seasonal rhythms that are not merely reactions to external seasonal stimuli have been observed in most living organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue their free-running cycle for a certain period even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's research was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, either labeling the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have several different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genome they have affected, and whether they have impacted germ cells or other cells.
Only mutations occurring in germ cells can be inherited by children, and mutations occurring elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting nature destinations with the purpose of enjoying the landscapes – including wild plants and animals.
Examples of activities at the destination include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits, and learning about ecosystem information.
One example can be visiting the orangutans in Borneo, learning about them, and photographing them.
Every morning, the residents of small rural towns drive to work, and they encounter others whose workplace is where they themselves came from.
In such dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is somehow connected to the car-based transportation system and at the same time supports it.
Science now provides evidence that the massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of the stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, one rarely hears as many complaints about water quality or crumbling bridges.
Why do traffic systems cause so many complaints, why do they fail daily? Are traffic planners just incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is a study that examines the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave relatively consistently. Thus, traffic flows generally have reasonably good coherence and can be presented in a rough mathematical manner.
To better describe traffic flow, a relationship has been established between the following three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
Understanding these relationships aids in the planning, designing, and maintenance of the road network.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. The ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back against their bodies.
This way, they have a wider selection of small spots to hide from predators.
Dragonflies and mayflies are currently the only insects that cannot fold their wings backward.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite, that the entire Solar System rotates around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems reasonable, since the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
Amazon is the second longest and largest river in the world. It has more than 8 times the water compared to the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, at its widest 6 miles.
A full 20 percent of the water flowing from our planet's rivers to the oceans originates from the Amazon.
The actual length of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Even though the construction of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size or craftsmanship of the Giza pyramids was never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were already well over a thousand years old at the time.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the world's smallest independent state and the smallest state in the world by population.
The Vatican City State uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Most of the people working in the state speak Italian in their everyday language as well, but Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known common chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they all occur naturally in their own form and are also relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is composed of a combination of one or more elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
It resembled more the four states of matter – in the order of solid, liquid, gas, and plasma – but he also theorized that they transform into other substances to form what we see.
Metal alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. There are, of course, also metals like gold and silver.
There are also metal alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period ending this sentence.
So the pencil became a good friend to many when it entered the market.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods have developed, the value and uses of the pencil have become more neglected.
Nowadays, messages are written on a computer screen, and there's never a need to reach for a sharpener.
One can only guess what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb operates on the principle that it requires energy to form a nucleus composed of many protons and neutrons.
It’s a bit like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which is why they are prone to disintegrate from a slight or non-existent shove.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called its crust.
The thickness of the Moon's crust is about 70 kilometers on the Earth-facing side and about 100 kilometers on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker in the highlands.
There may be more dark sea areas on the visible side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories primarily focus on studying what is behind people's behavior or what appeals to them.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized as they have matured.
These theories examine why some people want what they want and what factors in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory are popular content theories.
When leaders begin to lead their former peers, generally, two different behavior models can emerge. At one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or gals).
A leader like this has difficulty making unpopular decisions, maintaining discipline, assessing performance, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the group has done and make it their own.
The manager is ultimately responsible for the group's successes and failures.
Such behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are expected to have the same level of quality as traditional teams, but with slight differences.
Virtual team members act as liaisons to their immediate physical group.
They often have more decision-making power than regular team members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones and their local management may not always understand this.
The presence of a genuine "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, 109) is also one of the unique components of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the leadership team to which all members report. The invisible team determines the requirement level for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process that establishing a learning organization requires? One of the goals of implementing systematic learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently across all functioning departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process in which the organization works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that serves the needs of the customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders must create an innovative culture and share knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approach to studying consciousness. Therefore, it narrows the field of research and makes it much more exact.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain psychological functions.
The proliferation of new technologies provides the opportunity to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This way, we obtain a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes of our mind.
Although artificial intelligence is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of information technology that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
In artificial intelligence research, the aim is to get machines to automatically perform tasks that require intelligent activity.
Examples include monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client's diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These have become specialized fields of study that focus on providing solutions to real problems.
Nowadays, artificial intelligence is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and national defense, just as it is built into many home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are an important part of education. Often, the teacher would like to take the students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution, namely virtual field trips. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting at their desks.
Sharing the class trip virtually is an excellent way to reminisce about it and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital. The site is renewed annually, but its old versions are preserved online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. In the initial stages of students' blogging experience, grammar and spelling are often careless, but the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since the students themselves are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts to make an effort to improve their writing and avoid criticism.
Additionally, blogging "forces students to better understand the world around them." The need to feed the readers' interest inspires students to be clever and engaging (Toto 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can enable students to be more analytical and critical. By actively responding to materials on the Internet, students can define their position against the background of other people's writings and bring out their own perspective on the issue at hand" (Oravec 2002).
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada, with a rich array of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north is, among other things, the pristine, scenic Muskoka.
These and many other factors create the impression of Ontario as a place that outsiders consider the epitome of Canada.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
The following demographic comparison surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are citizens in Canada altogether.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is clearly the largest of them and in terms of its nature, it's like its own continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or part of France, and they are known as luxurious beach destinations.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the countries, and it gained a lot of momentum in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence of Europe and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The area is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women – All female travelers are advised to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring also helps (as long as it doesn't look too valuable).
Women should understand that cultural differences may lead to situations that they might experience as harassment. It is not uncommon for someone to start following behind, grab by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences do not justify advances!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 9th century BCE by Berber fishermen, and it was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids, who called it Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca only to abandon it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city under the name Dar-ul-Badya, and Spanish merchants who established trading posts there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping destinations in Morocco.
From the old medina, it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, water pipes, and a wide range of trinkets, but all of it is intended for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city on the eastern edge of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and buried most of its streets, especially in the city center.
Goma is reasonably safe, but all trips outside the city require prior research to determine the current state of ongoing fights in the North Kivu region.
The city is also the starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo. There you can also find some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trackers in Africa.
For getting around in Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The typical (local) fare is about 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
When combined with its relatively difficult location, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Nowadays, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
It was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites in 1990 due to the threat posed by desert sand.
It was one of the most important stops on Henry Louis Gates's PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is a stark contrast to the country's other cities, as it has more of an Arabian than an African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The area of the park is 19,500 km², and it is divided into 14 different natural areas, each supporting a different variety of wildlife and natural vegetation.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
A daily conservation and entrance fee is charged in the park, as is the case in all South African national parks.
It may be useful to also purchase the Wild Card, which grants access to either some of South Africa's parks or all of South Africa's national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the Hong Kong area, and it is the main destination for many tourists.
The procession of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a glistening bar chart, best seen in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
You can see the best parts of Hong Kong by leaving the island and heading to the Kowloon harbor area located opposite.
The majority of the urban area of Hong Kong Island is situated on the densely built-up reclamation land of the north shore.
This very place is where the British colonial masters made their own, and if you are looking for signs of the area's colonial history, it is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest area in the world. It extends 80 kilometers (50 miles) inland from the coast to the hinterlands of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on the Indian side is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps, but include some of the last remnants of the magnificent jungles that once covered the entire Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 square kilometers, of which about one third is covered by water or wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary. It is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 axis deer.
Buses depart from the inter-county bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakari and Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Because the local buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust, run to most of the districts.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River and connects the city of Oiapoque in Brazil with the city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long, and it has two lanes that are three and a half meters wide.
The underpass height of the bridge is 15 meters. Construction work was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to the schedule, the bridge should be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian border stations are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group living in the area of present-day Eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters, but also practiced subsistence farming.
In the Chaco region lived other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who made a living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies," emerged as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous peoples of the land in the 16th century.
The Spanish began the colonial era, which lasted three hundred years.
Paraguay has succeeded in preserving much of its original character and identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is famous for having some of the world's best polo teams and players.
The biggest tournament of the year will be held in December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen during other seasons.
You can get news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches from the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged to match the value of the British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money only at the island's only bank, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and United States dollars are often accepted as well.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the outer islands, although currencies from the United Kingdom and the United States might be valid. Determine the accepted method of payment by asking the owners in advance.
Exchanging the currency of the Falkland Islands outside the islands themselves is almost impossible, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone, and temperatures over 30 degrees are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively chilly: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes the air feel colder than the thermometer reading.
There are no distinct rainy seasons or dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are accustomed to seeing people, wild animals are still wild, and they should not be fed or disturbed.
Park authorities advise staying at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from other wildlife.
Bison, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack, even though they may look very docile.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they didn't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Please also consider that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or preparing strongly scented foods and keep the campsite tidy.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu, and its population is slightly under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s, and it has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port experienced a notorious standoff between fleets, when seven ships – German, American, and British – refused to leave the port.
All ships sank except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost at the same time.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering held in the city led to the death of High Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many sandy beaches because Auckland is located between two harbors. The most popular ones are situated in three different areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the suburb of North Harbour) are on the Pacific coast and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming, and pohutukawa trees provide shade for most.
Tamaki Drive's beaches are located in Waitemata Harbour in the affluent neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
They are sometimes crowded family beaches, and the shoreline is lined with a good selection of shops. Swimming is safe.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It is not a multidimensional beer, but pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are several French wines worth trying, but New Zealand and Australian wines may keep better during the journey.
It is completely safe to drink local tap water, but the cautious will easily find bottled water.
The idea of a flat white-type milk coffee is foreign to Australians. A small black coffee is known as an espresso, and cappuccino is served with a large amount of whipped cream instead of frothed milk. Tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are pricey but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are organized throughout the year, and injuries due to any of these reasons are rare on the reef.
So take heed of the authorities' advice, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish can be found north of 1770 near the shores and river mouths from October to April. Occasionally, they can also be encountered at other times.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and are likely to swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not primarily live in the sea; rather, their primary habitat is the river deltas from Rockhampton northward.
By booking in advance, the traveler gains peace of mind knowing that upon reaching the destination, they have a place to sleep.
Travel agencies often have offers for certain hotels, but it may also be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through the agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to and from the airport, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also keep your reservation active if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, all changes and requests should first be directed through the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, a large majority of music festival attendees decide to camp in the area, and most participants consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the events, you need to arrive on time to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that even after the main stage performances have ended, there may be places at the festival where music continues to be played late into the night.
Some festivals have separate camping areas for families with children.
If you cross the northern part of the Baltic Sea during winter, check the location of your cabin, because passing through the ice can cause really terrible noise in the worst areas.
The St. Petersburg cruises include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos typically try their best to maximize the amount of time and money customers spend. There are usually no windows or clocks, and finding the exits can be difficult.
They often have special food, drink, and entertainment offers to keep customers in a good mood – and on the casino premises.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages on the house. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone intending to drive in high latitudes or mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or extremely cold temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is little friction, and you cannot drive the same way as you would on asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time that a car gets stuck.
Snowfall or snow flying in the wind, as well as moisture or ice accumulated on vehicle windows, may also reduce visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic generally operates year-round without interruptions.
Safaris are perhaps Africa's biggest attraction and the highlight of the visit for many.
Colloquially, the word safari refers to traveling overland with the purpose of observing Africa's magnificent wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars, and ordinary equipment is quite sufficient for observing them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
Walking safari (also known as bush walk, hiking safari, and trekking) refers to a hike lasting either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other localities across Japan.
Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it was the host of the 1964 games.
If you booked your flight or accommodation for the year 2020 before the deferral was announced, your situation might be difficult.
Cancellation policies vary, but based on the situation at the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500–130,000 yen, with tickets usually costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. In many hotels, it is possible to borrow an iron and ironing board, even if they are not in the room itself.
If an iron is not available or if you don't particularly care for ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (as it may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are various methods for water purification, some of which are more effective against certain threats.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil water for one minute, while in other areas several minutes are needed.
The efficiency of filters varies, and if you have any doubts, it is worth considering purchasing water from a reputable company in sealed bottles.
Travelers may encounter pests that they are not accustomed to in their home region.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in worse cases, allergic reactions, spread poison, and transmit diseases.
Actual infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people violently are generally not considered pests.
Tax-free shopping means the opportunity to purchase products at certain places that are exempt from excise and sales taxes.
Travelers heading to countries with heavy taxation may sometimes save significant amounts of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
On the section between Point Marion and Fairmont, the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo–Pittsburgh highway prevail, as it repeatedly passes through remote forest terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, stay alert: you'll encounter many steep ascents and descents, narrow lanes, and sharp bends.
The designated speed limits are significantly lower than on previous and subsequent sections - usually 35–40 miles per hour (56–64 kilometers per hour) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
Strangely enough, mobile phone coverage is much better here than in many other places along the way, like in the Pennsylvania Wilds area.
German pastries are quite good and in Bavaria, they are rather hearty and diverse, resembling the pastries of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common. Apple pastries are made year-round, and cherries and plums are popular fillings in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often taste especially good with a strong cup of coffee.
If you crave small yet substantial pastries, try one that is called either Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices together with either meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland areas of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries. In Southern India and some other coastal areas of the peninsula, coconut milk is usually used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term encompassing a wide variety of regional food cultures across the country.
However, if the term is used without additional definitions, it generally refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago, featuring a wide array of simply seasoned dishes. The flavors favored by the Javanese include peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and a variety of aromatic spices.
Stirrups are the rider's foot supports, which hang on either side of the saddle.
The rider gets more stability from them, but they can be associated with safety concerns, because the rider's legs may become entangled in them.
If a rider falls off a horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, the runaway horse might end up dragging them behind it. Various precautions can be taken to reduce this risk.
First of all, most riders wear heeled riding boots with a smooth and rather narrow sole.
In some saddles, especially English ones, there is a safety bar that allows the stirrup leather to detach from the saddle if a falling rider pulls it backward.
Cochamó Valley – Chile's number one climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America. The valley features various large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer breathtaking views. Climbers from around the world constantly create new routes on its endless walls.
Skiing sports, which include alpine skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports where one descends snowy terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important tourism activity, and many enthusiasts, sometimes called ski bums, plan entire vacations around skiing at a specific destination.
Skiing as a concept is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers were made as early as 5000 BCE!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first recreational ski resort in Australia.
Backpacking with skis: this activity is also called wilderness skiing, ski trekking, or ski touring.
It is related to alpine skiing-style trekking or mountaineering, but it usually does not include that, because the latter is practiced in steep terrain, and it requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can progress somewhat faster than on foot, but you will very rarely reach the same speed as when skiing on maintained tracks without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but there are many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean filling out visa applications and passing passport controls multiple times.
However, the Schengen Area functions in this regard somewhat like a single nation.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control again.
When you have a Schengen visa, you also do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen member country separately, thus saving time, money, and the hassle of paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured goods are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define all items over one hundred years old as antiques.
The definition varies according to geographical location. For example, in North America, newer items are considered antiques than in Europe.
Handicraft products may be defined as antiques, even if they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sámi people, and the culture associated with it is also important for many practitioners of other professions.
However, not all Sámi people have traditionally participated in large-scale reindeer herding, but have lived from fishing, hunting, and similar livelihoods, and kept reindeer primarily as draft animals.
Nowadays, many Sámi people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi.
Although the word gypsy is widely used, especially among non-Romani people, it is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Romani people.
If there is a travel advisory for the country you are visiting, it may affect your travel health insurance and trip cancellation insurance.
Maybe it's worth asking for advice from other states as well, in addition to your own, even though their advice is for their own citizens.
As one example, Americans in the Middle East may find themselves in different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The announcements are just brief summaries of a country's political situation.
The presented views are often superficial, generalized, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information available from elsewhere.
A dangerous weather is a general term for all hazardous weather phenomena that may cause damage, serious societal disruptions, or loss of human life.
Dangerous weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of it that may depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Hard winds, hailstorms, heavy rainfall, and wildfires are forms and consequences of dangerous weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
The dangerous weather's regional and seasonal phenomena include blizzards, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Passengers are strongly advised to be aware of the threat of hazardous weather affecting their travel destination, as it may impact travel plans.
Everyone who wants to visit a country that may be interpreted as a war zone should receive professional training.
An internet search for "Hostile Environment Course" will likely return the address of a local company.
In the course, all the topics addressed here are usually covered in much more detail and generally combined with practical experience.
The course usually lasts 2–5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapon training.
Books and magazines about surviving in the wilderness are common, but publications about war zones are scarce.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of authorities to issue passports without a gender designation (X), or to update documents to reflect the desired name and gender, varies.
The willingness of foreign authorities to respect these documents varies just as much.
Security screenings have also become much more intrusive since September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not undergone surgery should not expect to maintain their privacy and dignity through security scanners.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves breaking on the shore. They are often found on reefs or similar places.
Due to the underwater formations, the rip current concentrates in a few deeper parts, and a rapid current can form there in the deep water.
Most deaths are the result of exhaustion when trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to head somewhere you won't get swept away by the current again, or depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, it might be wise to wait for rescuers.
The shock of returning hits earlier than the culture shock (the acclimatization phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their own home culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of the customs of your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to get accustomed to a new country.
People do not necessarily realize that patience and understanding are also important for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most fascinating things in the area for children.
The pyramids can be seen in the dark, and before the show starts, they can be seen in complete silence.
Usually, one always hears the voices of travelers and vendors. The story of light and sound is just like a fairy tale.
The Sphinx is the background of a long story and its narrator.
Scenes are performed against pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
Many countries have claimed the South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, and they indeed have the most bases. In 2020, there were sixteen active bases.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island, where the Villa Las Estrellas settlement is located.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the water-filled crater of an active volcano serves as a stunning natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is an area bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea south of the peninsula.
The mountains of the peninsula merge there with the plain and then rise again to form the 360-kilometer long Ellsworth Mountains, which the Minnesota Glacier divides in two.
In the northern part, namely the Sentinel Range, are located Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is Mount Vinson at 4,892 meters.
In remote areas where mobile phones have no coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone because to make a call, you need to be outside with an unobstructed view of the satellite.
The service is often used in maritime activities, including on yachts. Similarly, it is used by expeditions that require data and voice remote communications.
Your local telephone service provider will probably be able to give you more information about connecting to that service.
Traveling and learning is an increasingly popular option among those planning a gap year.
It is particularly popular among those finishing school, as they can take a gap year before university without their education suffering.
In many cases, participating in a gap year course abroad can even improve the chances of continuing higher education studies in one's own country.
Typically, a course fee is charged for participating in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent boating destination. In the land of a thousand lakes, there are also thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and on lakes, you don't necessarily need a boat the size of a ship.
Even though the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are large enough for any boat, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a common leisure activity in Finland, where there is one boat for every seventh or eighth person.
The ratio is the same as in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise very rare (e.g., in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most actual Baltic Sea cruises include a longer visit to St. Petersburg.
This means that you can visit the historical city for a few days and still return to the ship to sleep at night.
You do not need a separate visa if you only go on shore excursions arranged by the ship (as of 2009).
Some cruise brochures include Germany's Berlin. As can be seen from the map above, Berlin is not anywhere near the sea, so a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced something traumatic.
There is no reason to be ashamed of it: it does not differ from the fears and dislikes of many other people towards certain other things.
For some people, a certain understanding of how an airplane works and what happens during a flight may help overcome the fear stemming from ignorance or a feeling of helplessness.
Transport companies are paid well for fast deliveries. Often, speed is very important for companies' documents, merchandise, or spare parts needed for urgent repairs.
Larger companies have their own aircraft on some routes, but on other routes and for smaller companies, there was a problem.
If they sent the goods by air freight, on some routes the unloading of freight and customs clearance could take several days.
The only way to get the item through faster was to send it as registered baggage. Airline regulations do not allow sending baggage without a passenger, so this is where you are needed.
An obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a large wad of cash for this privilege (or perhaps preferably let your company do it for you).
However, it won't come cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the price of economy class for business class and up to eleven times the price for first class!
Generally speaking, it's not even worth looking for discounts on business class or first class seats for direct flights from place A to place B.
Airlines know that there is a core group of air travelers who are willing to pay a fortune to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multinational republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
The conflict led to the declaration of independence of the Republic of Transnistria, located in eastern Moldova, in 1994. It has its own government and currency, but no UN member state recognizes it.
Economic ties have once again been established between these two parts of Moldova, even though political negotiations have failed.
The primary religion of Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is Turkey's third-largest city. Its population is about 3.7 million inhabitants, it is the country's second-largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling trade center, surrounded by mountains and spread around a vast gulf.
Amidst the wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers, there are traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market square, and old mosques and churches, even though the city's atmosphere resembles Mediterranean Europe more than traditional Turkey.
In Haldarsvík, there is an unusual octagonal church, and the village offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy.
There are interesting dove sculptures on some tombstones in the churchyard.
It's worth spending half an hour strolling in the fascinating village.
North from there, and easily accessible, is the romantic and captivating city of Sintra. Foreigners came to know it from the laudatory account written by Lord Byron, in which he described its splendor.
ScottUrb's bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the northern direction, it's also worth visiting the great Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, which is globally famous for the apparition of Mary.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave and a site whose significance for a significant portion of the world's people is almost immeasurably great.
There are still many men and women alive who survived after being there, and many others whose loved ones were murdered or forced to toil themselves to death there, both Jewish and non-Jewish alike.
Remember to treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the place by drawing or scratching graffiti on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the majority understands it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
Most of the signs are, however, marked only in Catalan because it is the first official language according to the law.
However, Spanish is also commonly used in public transportation and other services.
The regular announcements on the metro are only in Catalan, but the automated system notifies of unexpected disruptions in many different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant people.
Even though it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to dress decently and behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). It makes getting around considerably easier.
The Parisians' rude exterior quickly dissipates if you show just ordinary politeness.
There is a lot of forest in Plitvice National Park, mainly beeches, spruces, and pines, and its vegetation is a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean plants.
There is a remarkably wide range of plant communities due to various microclimates, varying soil types, and differences in elevation.
There are also an extraordinarily large number of different animal and bird species living in the area.
Alongside more common species, you can encounter rare wildlife there, such as bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wild cats, and capercaillies.
Women visiting monasteries must wear skirts that cover the knees, and the shoulders must also be covered.
But if you bring your own scarf, especially a brightly colored one, you might get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men need to wear trousers that reach below the knee.
You can also borrow them from the clothing selection at the entrance, but they are not washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable in these skirts. One size fits all men!
Like the cuisines of similar Mediterranean regions, Mallorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in everything.
A simple popular dinner especially in the summer is pa amb oli: bread with olive oil and tomato as well as any available side dish, such as cheese or tuna.
All nouns, and additionally the word "Sie" meaning "you," always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs from objects.
It can also make reading easier, although writing is complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively easy because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters C and G should be given the most attention, as their pronunciation depends on the following vowel.
Also remember to pronounce r and rr differently. Caro means dear, carro means carts.
The grammar of Persian is quite easy and mostly regular.
Therefore, reading this grammar book would help to learn many things about Persian grammar and improve the understanding of sentences.
It goes without saying that if you know any Romance language, learning Portuguese is easier.
However, those who know little Spanish might quickly assume that Portuguese is so similar that there is no need to study it separately.
Nowadays, old-fashioned observatories are generally not used for their original purpose, but have been converted into museums or learning environments.
Since light pollution was not the same problem during their glory days as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, and are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities, and they are located in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
Viewing cherry blossoms, or hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea was obtained from China, where the most popular flower was the Japanese apricot.
In Japan, the emperor held the first cherry blossom celebrations only for himself and other members of the aristocracy influential in the imperial court circle.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "just one" as a sample.
If you visit an official and maintained garden, you'll be thrown out for collecting "specimens" without any buts.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to stay, and it's very easy to find your way around there. You can buy almost anything after arrival.
However, being in the heart of the tropics only a few degrees north of the equator, you have to endure both the heat (always) and the intense sunshine (when the sky is clear, which happens less frequently).
In addition, a few buses travel north to Hebron, traditionally considered the burial site of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives.
Check that the bus you are planning to take also goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme around which to plan a holiday.
For example, a visit to the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or a cruise to interesting cities along the Danube, or boating on the Erie Canal.
They also dictate the course of popular hiking and biking trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world have also adopted many traditions associated with the celebration.
According to tradition, Easter night is spent awake in an open place to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often conduct an Easter Vigil Mass on the Saturday evening of the Easter weekend. The congregation often bursts into celebration at the stroke of midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the island got there by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because the mainland was very far away, mammals were unable to survive the journey, so the giant tortoise became the primary grass-eating animal in the Galápagos Islands.
Since humans arrived on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced there, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic region in winter, you will experience the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights because the sky is dark nearly around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore not an issue, you can also admire the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners might be accustomed to.
Suits are a common work attire, and colleagues address each other by surname or title.
Harmony in the workplace is absolutely essential. Instead of personal achievements, teamwork is emphasized.
Employees often need to obtain the supervisor's approval for all decisions they make, and they are expected to follow the supervisor's instructions without question.
