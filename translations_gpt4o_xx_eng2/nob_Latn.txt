This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already popular, but also shows details that fossils usually cannot show, such as colors and three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on top with a pale or carotenoid color on the underside.
The discovery additionally provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called a rachis, but have other features for feathers – barbs and sheaths – the researchers assumed that rachis was likely a later evolutionary development like the other relevant features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or appearance. The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not chick down.
The researchers suggested that, although this was the tail of a dinosaur, the specimen showed the plumage of an adult and not a chick's down.

The work that was undertaken was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations from the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was searching for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon affects the gravity on Earth, thereby causing tides, the Milky Way influences the Sagittarius galaxy with its forces.
The researchers concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in exactly the same way as ordinary matter does.
This theory suggests that the majority of the dark matter around a galaxy is located in a kind of halo, and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll came across tuberculosis (XDR-TB) that was particularly resistant to medication in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very disturbing and alarming due to the very high mortality rate."
Dr. Moll believes that some of the patients may have been infected by the bacteria at the hospital, and at least two of them were healthcare workers.
Within the span of a year, an infected person can easily transmit the virus to 10 to 15 of their close contacts.

Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth, which are often maintained by a fairly constant temperature, but rather they correspond with these by being deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: Voters enter a booth alone, place a pre-printed piece of paper indicating their candidate's choice in an envelope.
After the officials confirm the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter roll.
French electoral law has quite strict codification of legal proceedings.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can witness that no envelopes are present at the start of the voting and that no envelopes are added except for those that are carefully counted and from authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness all parts of the process. During the evening, votes are counted by volunteers following specific procedures and under strict supervision.

Carpanedo competed in 2 individual races in the championship in addition to Wednesday's event.
Her first event was slalom, but she did not finish the race. There were 36 of 116 competitors who did not finish the slalom race.
In her second run, she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting category with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than Austria's Claudia Loesch in first place, and 1:09.02 minutes behind Hungary's Gøngyi Dani in ninth place.
In the women's sitting group, there were four skiers who did not finish the race, and 45 of the total 117 athletes in giant slalom failed to advance.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five persons who raped the Swiss woman and found her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The accused appeared in court with covered faces, said Chief Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki.
Even though there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The emergency services helped the driver out of the red Audi TT, while the street where the accident had occurred was temporarily closed.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been in Edinburgh court charged with killing her son.
She is in custody and awaiting indictment and trial, but any potential eyewitnesses may have been influenced since her picture has been widely publicized.
This is common in other parts of the United Kingdom, but Scottish law works differently, so courts assess the publication of images as potentially harmful to the victim.
Professor Pamela Ferguson at the University of Dundee notes "journalists seem to be hanging by a thin thread if they publish pictures, etc., of suspects."
Journalists have been informed by the Crown Office, which has overarching responsibility for the prosecution service, that no further comments will be made before the indictment.
According to the leak, the document is to refer to the land border disputes, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders as they were before the 1967 war in the Middle East.
The future situation of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations and the Jordan Valley, was among the topics that were addressed.
Israel demands continued military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian state agrees to allow this force to remain for only five years.
Shooters in the supplementary pest control were closely monitored by forest rangers, which led to the trial being supervised and its efficiency evaluated.
In collaboration with the NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director for conservation and heritage at NPWS, the four shooters for the first shooting operation were given extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new electoral council (CEP) with 9 members yesterday.
It is actually Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
A presidential commission recommended last month the dismissal of the former CEP (Haiti's electoral commission) as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The commission was a response from Martelly to widespread demonstrations against the regime, which began in October.
The sometimes violent demonstrations arose due to the absence of held elections, some overdue since 2011.
Around 60 cases of overheated iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and giving four people minor burn injuries.
The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (METI) said that they had been aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay of the report "very regrettable."
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 local time (19:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands' crisis management office said that no damage was reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said that there was no indication of a tsunami coming.
A Filipino man who was formerly a police officer has held tourists in Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in the capital of the Philippines, Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Eventually, the photographer took the seat of an old woman when she needed the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and chose a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and in 1959 he began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital.
Liggins began to investigate preterm birth in his spare time while he worked at the hospital.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the development of the baby's lung.
Xinhua reported that government investigators retrieved two "black boxes" on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated that "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first boss. Luna died on the night of two moons. Quite unique, just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said that "Luna was as weird as me... maybe even more... love her and will miss her... hopefully, she is in a better place."
Of 1400 people who voted before the federal election in 2010, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the campaign at the federal election in 2010 that Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent in the poll share this viewpoint and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the opinion poll, 29% think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim both the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and three stages at the Commonwealth Games, but due to the complaints, there are doubts about his form.
He has not been able to take the necessary medication to overcome the pain, because they are banned from the games.
Curtis Cooper, who is a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, it was reported on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the cause of water on Earth, in addition to organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Since comets collided with the Earth a long time ago, researchers hope to understand how planets are formed, especially with regard to the Earth.
Cuomo (53) began serving as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month that legalized same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political chatter and stupidity."
It is speculated whether he will run as a presidential candidate in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, will make it possible to fly shorter routes, save a lot of fuel annually, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based technology, which allows air traffic control to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport will be provided, overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and short-term facilities are unavailable at the ground.
The possibility that one would be forced to play the game behind closed doors without the team's supporters was raised due to fears of a lack of transportation.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species in the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species had evolved in just two generations, although many had thought that this process would take much longer due to the breeding among the endemic Darwin's finch, the medium ground finch, and the cactus finch immigrant the large cactus finch.
Gold can come in all possible forms. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can also be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into a sheet.
It can be made very thin and adhere to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used as decoration in the hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called a chemical pH. You can create an indicator using cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice will change color entirely depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is marked by how many hydrogen ions (H in pH) are present in the chemical that was tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons without electrons (since hydrogen atoms are one proton and one electron).
Mix together the two dry powders and then, with clean wet hands, press them together into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, and this feels strange and creates a kind of shell.
Almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had water closets connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient times, there were also toilets in Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, the toilets were sometimes a part of public bathhouses where men and women were together.
The times you call someone who is several thousand kilometers away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the conversation and then reflects it back down, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere causes some of the light and our vision to become distorted.
It takes a gigantic rocket over 100 British feet tall to send a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in wonderful ways. The best thing the wheel has given us is a means of transportation that is much easier and faster.
It has given us many means of transport such as the train, the car, and more.
Under them, there are several medium-sized cats that prey on medium-sized game such as hares to antelopes and roe deer.
Finally, there are several small cats (including stray pet cats) that eat the much more numerous prey animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret behind the success is the niche concept. A special job each cat has, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats and they live together in larger groups called alliances.
The alliances consist of 1–3 adult males who are related, along with up to thirty females and pups.
The females are usually closely related to each other, as they constitute a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions behaves much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that have surprisingly much in common with the behavior of lions (but not with other big cats). They are also deadly to their prey.
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (not very well), swim, jump over large distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These 4 cats are the only ones that roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the fully grown roar of a lion, but more like a sentence with yappy words.
The ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and even birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelots hunt are much smaller than they are.
Researchers believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by smelling, sniffing the ground to find where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and also move completely unnoticed. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings before attacking the prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they came from, for example, if they move over a mountain range or a river, or if they relocate to a new island in such a way that they cannot easily move back, they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
The new population will need different functions or adaptations than they needed before to be a strong competitor, since this new environment has different resources and different competitors.
The original population has not changed; they still need the same accommodation as before.
When the new people gradually start to adapt to their new surroundings, they increasingly resemble the other population less and less.
After a couple of thousand years or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We have named this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and is a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans inhale, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (so just breathe deeply out).
The plants make their food from the sun using photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Animals would not survive without plants.
The Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, not afraid of anything except other Mosasaurs.
The long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the upper mouth; no one who crossed its path came away alive.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may also have been a cannibal.
In addition, it also attacked anything that came into the water, even a gigantic dinosaur like the T. rex would be no match for it.
Even though most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feast items, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormice.
The fact that poor people and women ate their meals while sitting in chairs, whereas the rich men liked to have banquets together where they lay on their sides while eating their meals, was another difference.
The meals of ancient Rome cannot have included foods that came to Europe from the United States or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn or tomatoes, nor potatoes or cocoa, and no ancient Romans have tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each god and these were regarded as the home of God.
People brought offerings to the gods, and the priests tried to fulfill the gods' needs with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes they built special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary made for the god.
Houses were not so essential in the high-temperature climate of the Middle East.
The Hebrew family lived mostly outdoors in the open.
The women did the cooking in the garden; the shops were only open counters facing the street. The houses were built of stone.
There were no large forests in the lands around Canaan, which made the timber extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Norse sagas, it is told that Erik the Red was deported from Iceland for murder, and then they found Greenland while traveling west and named it Greenland.
But there were already Eskimo tribes living there at that time, independent of his discovery.
There were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, even though all the countries were "Scandinavian".
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you can probably imagine that there is a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, it is not true. Despite something being written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, it was written: "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text can be seen at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence the large parchment document (it measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
So the note was likely added as a label.
The invasion and the subsequent battles on D-Day liberated Northern France, but Southern France was still not liberated.
It was controlled by French "Vichy" individuals. These were French people who had negotiated peace with the Germans in 1940 and actually worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
The invasion on August 15, 1940, when the Allies invaded southern France, was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated the southern part of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a fairly large population that lives and works together as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and this thus in a way defines the size of the society.
City-states are precursors to nations. A civilization's culture presupposes passing on knowledge through multiple generations, a linguistic footprint, and fair transmission that endures.
Smaller cultures usually disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not regarded as proper civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government with the Congress as its only component – under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national leader or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, who were usually unwilling to cooperate to enforce its actions.
It also had no authority to override the tax law and tariffs between the states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often not present.
The Italian and the German national teams are the second best teams in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motorsport are well-liked sports.
Winter sports are most popular in northern areas, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest is called Honshu), and this makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in a geographical context, as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's beginning dates back to the 1400s when European sailors passing by gave the island the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began converting to indigenous grain production practices, employing Chinese workers to work on their rice fields and sugar plantations.
Forces from the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's coastal areas in the west and north in 1683, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) in 1895, the Qing Dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded the rights to Taiwan to Japan, which continued to rule the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has 3 important structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they were originally constructed.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu was fully restored in 1976 and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, 35 mm is still the most common format for still photography in the world, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced today, but even more importantly, the image sensor formats of digital cameras have inherited the aspect ratio of the camera.
It can be a bit confusing, but the 35mm format is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio to this format (division by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family formats) are similar, or approximately equal to this aspect's ratio.
The rule of thirds is much abused and often ridiculed, but it's a simple guideline that creates dynamism while also providing a standard for order in an image.
It states that the most effective placement of the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the picture into thirds horizontally and vertically (see example).
The Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was scrutinized during this period in European history.
For thousands of years, Christianity had united European states despite differences in language and customs.
Its all-pervading authority affected everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the essential principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to reduce pain and poverty, and that is why the church's funds exist.
The church's central authorities had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being followed.
A short time after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy demonstrated that the effect of cutting vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated widely accepted international law codified through several international agreements over the last two centuries.
The United Kingdom bombed international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire parts of the sea, creating danger for even neutral ships.
Germany was prepared for a corresponding response to its unrestricted submarine warfare as there was limited response to this tactic.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most residents and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing all the fear and horrors of war during the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the USA to work for Edison's company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor from his previous position) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each phase of China or each family that held power was a distinct dynasty.
Also, between each dynasty, there was an unstable age of divided provinces. The best-known of these periods were the Three Kingdoms, which took place over 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these periods, there was fierce warfare between many kings who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient China's history when thousands of people died while fighting for the throne in the great palace at Xiadel.
There are some social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the nation is governed by the citizens instead of just one ruler.
Also after the revolution, it was open to all male applicants, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applied to the military, because instead of class-based ranks, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was motivation for other oppressed people in the working class in other nations to also start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond the mortal life. He often used a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light), where he went to contemplate.
The cave itself, which has been preserved throughout the years, provides a very vivid representation of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
On a mountain top north of Mecca, the cave lies completely isolated from the rest of the planet.
It is actually not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. Once you are inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
There is nothing else to see but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The only one of the seven wonders that still stands today is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The great pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, includes many pyramids (with the Great Pyramid being the largest), many small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, while many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upstroke" symbol resembles a V, and the "downstroke" symbol resembles a pin or a square without a bottom.
Up means that you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means that you should start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and push the bow.
An upstroke usually produces a softer sound, while a downstroke is stronger and more decisive.
You are welcome to use a pencil and make your own marks, but do not forget that the printed bowing marks are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be taken into account.
The terrified royal family, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette along with their two young children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were on October 6, 1789, forced by a crowd of market women to return to Paris from Versailles.
The king and queen traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd shouting and yelling threats at them.
The ethnic group forced the king and queen to have their carriage windows completely open.
A member of the gang at one point swung the head of a royal guard, killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The Filipino people had to bear the cost of the war's American imperialism themselves, in the conquest of the Philippines.
They had to pay taxes by force to the American colonial regime to cover large parts of the costs, and the interest for bonds took place in the name of the Philippine authorities via the banks on Wall Street.
The super profits derived from the exploitation of the Filipino people were a fundamental gain of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the circumstances that led to the establishment of the order.
The age in which the events took place is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages in the period of European history that is the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages came after the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
The Mughal Empire did not interfere in social culture and traditions for most of its existence, but rather balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices and diverse and inclusive governing elites, which led to more systematic, centralized, and uniform regulations.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general views: That the development of technology itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology also has 'effects' on societies that are intrinsic rather than socially conditioned.
One could, for example, say that road development is due to the car.
A nationwide road network, on the other hand, is not economically viable if it is only used by a handful of cars, so new methods of production have been developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
Mass car ownership creates more occurrences of accidents on the roads, which has led to new methods being developed in the healthcare sector to repair injured bodies.
Romanticism had a greater element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
What characterized Romanticism was that the landscape shaped individuals and that, over time, geographical habits and cultures emerged, and that these, when they harmonized with the position in society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of fashion in our time, Constantinople was regarded as the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
It has been known to be an epicenter of luxury from around 400 AD to about 1100 AD.
The status was not the same in the 12th century mainly due to the crusaders who had returned with gifts such as silk and spices which were more appreciated than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style was at its peak in the period between the 10th–11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, the attire was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
But due to slow communication channels, styles in the West could lag behind by 25 - 30 years.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to create its own style. One of the biggest changes that came at that time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to use buttons to fasten garments.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture for the production of enough food to precisely meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses stored seeds native to the area combined with crop rotation or other techniques to maximize yields that are relatively simple.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, which is still relevant in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel excluded from social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive because of their members' age, ethnicity, class, area, and/or gender.
The qualities that specify a subculture include linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of several factors.
Members of a subculture often mark their membership with a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate how significant socialization is, is to focus on the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accident, or deliberate abuse, were not adequately socialized by adults during their upbringing.
Such children are called "wild children." Some wild children have been kept in captivity by humans (usually their own parents), in some cases due to the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical impairments.
It is possible that children who are wild may have undergone serious child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or managed to escape.
Others are allegedly raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When a wild child is completely raised by animals, it develops behavior (within physical limitations) that is almost identical to the nurturing animal, such as fear of or indifference toward humans.
Even though project-based teaching makes learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it to a new level.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather an aid that supports individuals undergoing a new learning experience, such as with a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and physical. A teacher can also, in other words, be a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support functions are embedded in the software and are intended to question, encourage, and explain procedures that may have been challenging for the student to handle independently.
Children are placed in foster homes for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even exploitation.
No children should have to grow up in an atmosphere that is not caring and educational, but it happens.
We perceive that the foster care system is a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system will provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should be able to provide all the necessities that they did not have in the home they came from.
It is a combination of elements with both mass and interpersonal communication on the internet.
The special characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in relation to the uses and gratifications approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered important motivational factors for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord also identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as new motivational aspects when they investigated audience reactions to websites (1998).
Using video recordings, significant discoveries have been made in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
It has particularly been claimed that one can determine if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks suggests in his article, The President's Tale, how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to assess sincerity correctly.
He also claims that such abilities to explain human behavior can be shared by animals, such as pet dogs.
According to modern research, there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation introduces a new gene variation, and selection removes it from the array of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination switch back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
It is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to obtain sufficient amino acids from the available plant resources out on the savannah.
Moreover, it has major consequences not to do so: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The proteins that are in leaves and legumes would be the most available plant resources, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest without cooking them first.
Animal food products (ants, termites, eggs) are in contrast not only easily digestible, but they also provide proteins in high quantities containing all the essential amino acids.
We should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that the chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of consciously waking up during the normal sleep period and then falling asleep again a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be achieved by using a rather quiet alarm clock that brings you to consciousness without fully waking you.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other alternatives based on biorhythm involve drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleeping, and this leads to having to get up to urinate.
How much inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with how much tension there is in body and soul.
The less tension, the more positive vital energy is present. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can become enlightened. The only thing standing in the way of gaining such insight is our own effort and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha but was expanded to include the Mahayana's path of love and several methods from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and complete love.
Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) can be awakened with Kundalini yoga through yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantra, and visualization.
Tibetan meditation is about deity yoga. The energy channels are cleansed by envisioning various deities. This way, the chakras will be activated and consciousness will be enlightened.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which caused cooperation between the USSR and the USA. The clashes between system, process, and culture led to the countries falling out towards the end of the war.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had now become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last the next 40 years and would truly be fought, by proxy armies on battlefields in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places from Africa to Asia.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the last option was to retreat and reorganize along Romania.
However, these plans became almost obsolete overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga peace agreement, the Soviet-Polish peace treaty, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is undoubtedly the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The job of the marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
The campaign in the North Atlantic during World War II is one of the most important recent examples of this. The Americans attempted to move men and materials across the Atlantic to provide assistance to Britain.
The German navy simultaneously attempted to stop this traffic, mostly by using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have managed to conquer Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
It started with ancient cultures and tribes keeping them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed hills or other places for grazing, usually looked after by goat herders who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more well-known shepherd. These methods of herding are still used today.
Wagon tracks in England were made as early as the 1500s.
Even though the wagon roads consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull in order to achieve higher speeds and carry more load than on the somewhat rougher roads of that time.
To keep the tracks in place, the crossbar was introduced quite early. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks were more effective if there was a strip of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the flat iron caused more wear on the tricycles in the wagons.
Gradually, the tricycles were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the first known means of transport. Humans began walking upright 2 million years ago when Homo Erectus (which means upright man) emerged.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, usually did not walk upright.
Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago, and bidirectional specialization has been discovered in fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2–3.9 million years ago.
We can start by adopting a more environmentally friendly lifestyle, we can join the environmental movement, and we can also become activists to a certain extent to mitigate future pain.
This is often just like symptomatic treatment. But if we want more than a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and remove them.
The world has changed significantly due to mankind's scientific and technological advancements, and challenges have become more complicated because of overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
A handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing house after its adoption by Congress on July 4th.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight and these are now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8.
The one arrived to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The first handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today—they are called birds.
Some people don't consider them true dinosaurs since they have feathers and the ability to fly.
But there are many things about birds that still remind one of a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all PCs used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded with binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1. These numbers are referred to as binary digits – or bits, to use data jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are generally not sufficient for an immediate diagnosis to be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be finding open medicine containers or toxic household items at the location.
For first aid instructions specific to the poison in question, refer to the label.
Entomologists use the word insect in a formal sense for this income group.
This term originates from an old association with mites, insects that are highly adapted to attack humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, adapted to live in the nest or house of their host.
As far as we know, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) across the United States, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may conclude that it is not best for them, or the child, to raise a child.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through a scientific method. Most scientific research is actually guided by this method.
Experimentation, however, is not alone there, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the potential hypotheses by asking questions. Observations also help to steer scientific research in the right direction.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's view on everything related to science, including psychology, was accepted.
When the knowledge of Greek deteriorated, the West grew more distant from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms that can be observed in physiology and behavior are usually entirely dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been detected in nearly all living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, and not just as reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that maintain a period of autonomous cycles without external influence.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the foremost propositions suggesting that DNA could be genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, in other words viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They made 2 attempts to label either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are bacterial cells.
Only mutations in bacterial cells can be passed on to offspring, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the plant and animal life.
Examples of location activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, going to parks, and examining details about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive their cars to get to work outside the village, while others drive in the opposite direction because their workplace is in the village that the others are driving out of.
In this dynamic means of transportation, everyone is in some way connected to and supporters of a transport system based on private cars.
Science shows that the large carbon economy has detached the biosphere from a stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Most are dissatisfied with transport systems.
In developed countries, one rarely hears complaints about the quality of water or about bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems cause such dissatisfaction, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interaction between them.
Unfortunately, it is complicated to study traffic flow, since it is impossible to predict the behavior of drivers with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave with some consistency so that the traffic flow remains fairly consistent and can be calculated mathematically with a reasonable degree of certainty.
To better demonstrate traffic flow, relationships have been established between three important characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships aid in the planning, design, and operation of driving facilities.
Insects were the first animals that could fly. Their ability to fly made it easier and more efficient for them to escape enemies, find food, and mates.
Most insects benefit from being able to fold their wings backwards along their bodies.
Because of this, they have several small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus believed that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some believed he was right, but many thought the opposite, that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the sun (and the other stars).
This seems reasonable, because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the largest and second longest river on Earth. Here, more than 8 times as much water flows as in the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, it is ten kilometers wide in some places.
As much as 20 percent of the water flowing out from the rivers on Earth and into the sea comes from the Amazon.
The main river, the Amazon River, is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from several thousand smaller rivers.
Even though pyramids continued to be built in stone until the end of the ancient Egyptian empire, they never surpassed the size and technical execution of the pyramids in Giza.
Egyptians from the New Kingdom in ancient times wondered at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Italian is the language used by Vatican City in legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the language used daily by government employees, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
Every citizen of the Vatican is Roman Catholic.
People have been aware of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all of these can be found in their natural state in nature, and because they are relatively easy to extract, even with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had theories that everything involves a mix of one or more of the earth's four elements. The four elements are earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the 4 states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also thought that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of 2 or more metals. Remember that there is a variety of elements on the periodic table.
The elements calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that several trillion of them can fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good helper for many people when it was launched.
Unfortunately, now that newer methods of writing have emerged, the pencil has been considered to have a lower status and usage.
People now write messages on computer screens and must never get close to a sharpshooter.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that to assemble a nucleus with more protons and neutrons, energy is required.
A bit like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Split the core anew and release some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to fall apart more or less unprovoked.
The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the front side and 100 km thick on the long side.
Thinner under Maria, and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there is more magma on the side facing us, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what motivates or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become more mature and approach adulthood.
These theories explore what it is about certain individuals that makes them want the things they do and what elements in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
As a rule, two behavior patterns emerge when leaders begin to manage their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum attempts to remain "one of the gang."
For this type of leader, it can be difficult to make unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assign responsibilities, and hold people accountable.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable person who feels he or she must change absolutely everything the team has done and make it their own.
Ultimately, it is the leader who is responsible for whether the team wins or loses.
This behavior often results in conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They usually have more autonomy than regular team members, since their teams might meet according to many different time zones, something that local management might not always understand.
An "invisible team" that is present (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p 109) is also a unique element in a virtual team.
The "invisible group" is the leadership group to which each of the members reports. The invisible group sets the standard for each individual member.
Why would an organization go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
If all available resources are utilized effectively by all functional departments in an organization, creativity and innovation can emerge.
The process in which an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can thus lead to a new innovative process that can help meet the needs of customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, management must create an innovation culture and share knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a way to provide assistance to organizations to improve their performance levels.
Neurobiological data provide physical documentation for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. It narrows the field of research and makes it more precise.
The interaction between brain pathology and behavior is a confirmation for researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injuries, traumas, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
Brain structures and processes we have never seen before can now be examined thanks to the emergence of new technologies.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes occurring in our brain.
Even though artificial intelligence (AI) gives a strong sense of science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in artificial intelligence is about creating machines for the automation of tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include monitoring and planning the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and inquiries, as well as handwriting analysis, voice and facial recognition.
These have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and defense, and is built into many home PCs and video game software.
Excursions are an important part of all classrooms. Teachers generally love to take students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Technology provides the opportunity for a solution with virtual excursions. Students can observe museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their classmates.
A great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes can also be to share the excursion virtually.
For example, students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the capital; each year the website is restructured, but old versions are kept online to be used as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Although students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
The blog writer started improving their writing to avoid criticism, as students are often the most critical audience.
Also, blogging "forces students to become more updated on the world around them." The need to deliver what the audience wants inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that motivates collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning abilities beyond the typical school day they are used to.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students to think more analytically and critically; by actively responding to internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others, as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada with several art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's history and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north, in Muskoka and beyond, one finds untouched nature in all its beauty.
All this and more shows Ontario what outsiders consider to be truly Canadian.
Large areas to the north are very sparsely populated, and some places are almost just uninhabited wilderness.
A comparison of the population that surprises many: There are more African Americans residing in the USA than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest of them, and is a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as luxury vacation spots.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the nations, and it became popular in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape route from Europe to India.
In the north, it is bordered by the Sahel, in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to what they might see as harassment and that it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be determined to say no to men, and do not be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it still does not make it acceptable!).
The city we know as Casablanca today was founded in the tenth century BC and was used as a strategic port under the name Anfa by Berber fishermen, Phoenicians, Romans, and the Marinids.
The Portuguese tore it down and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to leave it abandoned after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan built up the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was called Casablanca due to Spanish merchants who had established their trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the most boring shopping places in all of Morocco.
Places where you can buy traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hoodies, and a whole spectrum of djellabas, are easy to find around the old medina, but they are mainly sold to tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and is located in the east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano, which resulted in most of the city's streets, especially the city center, being buried.
Even though Goma is quite safe, any visits outside of Goma should be researched in advance to understand the ongoing conflicts in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing up the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the most affordable mountain trips to see gorillas in Africa.
To get around in Goma, you can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price is approximately 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
"Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands, combined with relative inaccessibility.
Even though Timbuktu has its own airport and its reputation has made the city a tourist attraction, it is a very poor city.
Due to the threat from the desert sands, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger in 1990.
It was one of the major stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the cities in the rest of the country, because it has a more Arabic than African character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River as its southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km² and can be divided into 14 different ecozones, which support various wildlife.
This is one of the most popular attractions in South Africa and is considered the most beautiful national park in South Africa (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It can also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card (a ticket), which provides access to either a selection of parks or all the national parks in South Africa.
The name Hong Kong comes from Hong Kong Island, and it is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up the skyline in Hong Kong has been compared to a glittering bar chart, clearly visible thanks to the waters that make up Victoria Harbor.
If you want the best view of Hong Kong, you can leave the island and travel to the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took over, and this is a good place to start if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past.
The largest coastal zone on the planet is the Sundarbans, which extends 80 kilometers (50 mi) inland into Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest that is within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps – here are some of the last remaining areas of jungle, which once covered the giant plains.
The Sundarbans consists of an area of 3,850 km² with approximately one-third of the area covered by water and marshland.
The Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 axis deer in the area.
Buses depart from the bus terminal (over the river) throughout the day, despite the fact that most of them, especially those buses heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, travel between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the district buses are often overcrowded, it is recommended to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Small Japanese coastal buses that are both comfortable and sturdy serve most districts.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects Oyapock and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers stand 83 meters tall, it is 378 meters high, and it has two lanes each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is fifteen meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it was closed to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be in full operation from September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The most significant indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay was the Guaraní group; they were semi-nomadic hunters, but agriculture was also their livelihood.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 1500s, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies," became a country as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the natives.
The colonization period, which lasted for 3 centuries, was started by the Spaniards.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its local character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams with some of the best players in the world.
This year's biggest tournament is held in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here.
See the Argentine Polo Association to find news about tournaments and where you can buy tickets for polo matches.
Falkland Islands pound (FKP) is the official currency of the Falkland Islands, with its value set equivalent to that of one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the island's only bank, which is located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere on the islands and within Stanley - credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are probably not accepted on the outlying islands, but British and American currencies may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to find out what is an approved payment method.
It is difficult to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so make sure to exchange money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there while it is winter in the northern part of the planet and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in subtropical regions; in the summer months, temperatures over +30°C are common.
The cold can be misleading in the winter as the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but a combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There aren't really distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons—the amount of rainfall is consistent throughout the year.
Most of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but nevertheless, the animals are wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
You should stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves according to the park authorities, and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
Bison, moose, deer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack no matter how peaceful they may appear.
Annually, dozens of visitors get injured because they have not maintained a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
Be additionally aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant meals and keep a clean camp.
The capital of Samoa is Apia. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
When seven ships from Germany, the USA, and the United Kingdom refused to leave the port in 1889, it became the notorious site of the sea protest.
Except for one British cruiser, all the ships were sunk and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful town assembly led to the killing of the leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Due to Auckland's two harbors, there are several beaches. The most popular ones are in three places.
The North Shore beaches in the North Harbor district are located in the Pacific Ocean. The beaches there stretch all the way from Long Bay in the north to Devonsport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are safe for swimming, and most have shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are on Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
Sometimes you find crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the coast. It is safe to swim.
The most important local beer is "Nummer en," which is not complex but a pleasant and refreshing beer. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines that should be tested, but wine from New Zealand and Australia might travel better.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you're concerned, bottled water is easy to find.
For people from Australia, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black is "espresso," cappuccino comes with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The cocoa lives up to Belgian standards. The fruit juice is expensive, but fantastic.
Throughout the year, there are many trips to the reef, and damage from any of these things rarely occurs.
Nevertheless, take advice from authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and close to rivers from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be observed outside this period.
There are sharks, but it is rare for them to attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not primarily live in the ocean. Their main habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind since they now have a place to sleep when they reach their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, though there may be opportunities to book accommodation in other areas, such as at a campsite, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies most often sell package deals that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even package combinations with flights and hotels.
They can also reserve a seat for you if you need time to think about an offer or get other documents for your agreement (for example, a visa).
All changes or requests should be made through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of the festival guards decide to camp on site, and most of the guards consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to where it all happens, you have to arrive early to get a camping spot close to the music.
Remember that there may be parts of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night even though the music on the main stage is finished.
At some festivals, there are special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are going over the North Sea in the winter, you should check the cabin's location, as driving through ice creates an extremely loud noise for those most affected.
Cruise to Saint Petersburg includes time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos tend to make many efforts to maximize the amount of time and money spent by the guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be hard to find.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment offers for the guests to keep them in a good mood and to make them want to stay at the place.
Some venues offer free alcoholic beverages. But alcohol impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Everyone who plans to drive at high altitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or cold temperatures.
The friction is low, so on ice and snow-covered roads, you cannot drive as you would on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall for you to slip in a very short time.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic mostly continues uninterrupted all year round.
Safari is perhaps the biggest form of tourism that attracts tourists to Africa and is the main focus for many visitors.
The expression safari in colloquial terms refers to trips to countries to see the magnificent African wildlife, specifically on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, like to approach cars and standard equipment, which will allow for good viewpoints.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can be quite shy, and you see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk" or "balance walk") involves going on a hike, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be from 08/24/2021 to 09/05/2021. Some events will be held elsewhere throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice. The city held the games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might struggle.
Cancellation policies vary, but since the end of March, cancellation policies have not been extended to July 2020, when the Olympics were planned.
It is expected that most activity tickets will cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets priced around ¥7000.
Ironing damp clothes can help to get them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for borrowing, even if it is not in the room.
If an iron is unavailable or you want to avoid wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer instead, if it is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinking, or in extreme cases, scorch marks).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil the water for one minute, while in others it needs several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if in doubt, you can simply buy the water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter contagious animal diseases that they are not familiar with from their home areas.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritations, or in the worst cases lead to allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals capable of harming or killing humans with their power, are usually not qualified as a pest.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from tax and can only be bought at certain places.
Travelers going to countries with high taxation can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo–Pittsburgh highway are the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont, which often passes through isolated backwoods terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep calm: there are many steep climbs, narrow roads, and sharp bends.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections – usually 35–40 miles per hour (56–64 km/h) – and it is even more important to respect them than usual.
Strangely enough, the mobile coverage is much better here than in many other places along the route, for instance, Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very tasty. In Bavaria, they are rich and varied and can be compared to the pastries of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with baked-in apples year-round, and cherries and plums make their entrance in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain nuts such as almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Many of the popular cakes taste especially good with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but substantial pastries, try what is called, depending on the region, Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry dish is based on herbs and spices, mixed with either meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of liquid you have in it, a curry dish can be either dry or moist.
In the inland regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is regularly used in curry dishes, while coconut milk is commonly used in Southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that covers a wide range of regional kitchens throughout the nation.
If used without further pointers, the term usually means food that originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island Java.
Now, much is available across the entire archipelago, the Javanese cuisine is characterized by lightly spiced dishes, with a dominant taste of peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups hang down on each side of the saddle and serve as supports for the rider.
They provide more stability for the rider, but can be less safe due to the possibility of a rider getting stuck.
If a rider is thrown from a horse with one foot caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged by the horse if it runs away. To minimize this danger, many precautions can be taken.
Most riders primarily use riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Thereafter, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that cause the stirrup leather to fall off the saddle if it is pulled backward by a falling rider.
The largest climbing destination in Chile, Cochamó Valley, is known as the Yosemite of South America, with many large walls and granite domes.
Climbing to the top offers stunning views from the mountain peaks. Climbers from all over the world continually create new routes in the endless seas of mountain walls.
The snow sport of downhill skiing, which includes both skiing and snowboarding, is a popular activity that involves riding down snowy slopes with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Ski vacation is a popular activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan entire holidays around skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depict skiers dating back as far as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century. In 1861, the first leisure-based ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity also has other names like backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is connected to, but usually does not include alpine skiing or alpine climbing, the latter being performed in steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as something similar to a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover longer distances than if you walk – but it is very rare that you will achieve high speeds without a heavy backpack on the track.
Europe is a fairly small continent, but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, a journey through several nations would mean multiple visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen Area, on the other hand, functions almost like one country in this regard.
As long as you stay within this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control points again.
At the same time, you do not need to apply for a visa for each individual Schengen member country if you have a Schengen visa, and therefore you save time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal explanation for what kind of manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies consider items that are older than 100 years to be antiques.
The definition has geographical differences, including that the age limit may be lower in places such as North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques despite being newer than equivalent mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sami and also important for the trade culture for many with other professions.
Even though traditionally not all Sámi people have been involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, they lived off fishing, hunting, and the like, while reindeer were mostly used as draft animals.
In our time, many of the Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Even though the word "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Romanians, it is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate impressions of the Romanian people.
If travel advisories are issued for the country you plan to travel to, it may affect your travel insurance or cancellation insurance.
You might also want to consult authorities other than your own, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
An example might be that American citizens in the Middle East encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The guides are only brief summaries of the political situation in a country.
The presentations that are shown are often superficial, general, and simple compared to the more detailed information found elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the general term for all very severe weather phenomena with the potential to cause damage, serious social consequences, or loss of human life.
Dangerous weather can occur everywhere in the world, and there are different types. Weather types can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy precipitation, and wildfires are forms and effects of extreme weather, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, downpours, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena consist of snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of bad weather affecting their area, as it may impact any travel plans.
Those who plan to visit countries considered as war zones should receive professional training.
An Internet search for "hostile environment courses" will likely provide the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues mentioned here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will usually last two to five days and involves role-playing, some first aid, and occasionally weapons training.
It is common to find books and magazines about wilderness survival, but there are few publications about war zones.
Travelers planning gender-confirming surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documents for their return journey.
The government's willingness to issue passports where gender is not marked (X) or documents updated to match a desired name or gender varies.
Foreign governments' willingness to honor these documents is just as variable.
In the time since September 11, 2001, searches at security checkpoints have also become far more intrusive.
Preoperative transgender individuals should not expect to pass through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves that break on the beach, a reef, or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections, creating a swift current so that deep water can form there.
Most of the deaths occur due to exhaustion while attempting to swim back against the current, which can be very problematic.
As soon as you get yourself out of the current, it is no more problematic than usual to swim back.
Try to aim for a place where you won't get pulled in again, or, depending on your skill and whether you've been noticed, you might be able to wait to be rescued.
A reverse culture shock occurs earlier than a culture shock (the tension phase is not the same as when moving out), it lasts longer, and can become more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their own culture.
When you return home after living in another country, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the old habits from your home culture.
The first time you traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding since they know that the traveler must adapt to a completely new country.
People might not realize that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
One of the most exciting things for kids in the area is the pyramid's sound and light show.
The pyramids are visible at night and you have the opportunity to see them in peace and quiet before the show starts.
Usually, you can always hear the sound of tourists and vendors here. The story of the sound and light is just like a fairy tale book.
The Sphinx is set both as the background and as the narrator of a long history.
Scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with 16 active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest of them is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
The area south of the peninsula is Ellsworth Land, which is bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains on the peninsula here merge into the plateau, then they reappear and form the 360 km long mountain range known as the Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
Mount Vinson's peak has an elevation of 4,892 meters and is located on Antarctica's highest mountain, Vinson Massif, in the northern part of the Sentinel Range.
In remote locations with lack of mobile coverage, satellite phones may be your only option.
A satellite phone generally cannot replace a mobile phone, as you need to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to be able to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, leisure boats, and additionally on expeditions that have remote data and communication needs.
You can get more information about connecting to this service from your local telephone service provider.
Receiving education while traveling is an increasingly common option for those planning to take a gap year.
This is particularly popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a gap year before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, taking a gap year abroad can actually improve your chances of getting into higher education when you return to your home country.
Usually, there will be a school fee that needs to be registered in this type of educational program.
Finland is a great destination for boat enthusiasts. "The land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
It is not necessary to have a yacht in the archipelagos and lakes.
Even though the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland with one boat per 7th or 8th person.
Even though this is similar for both Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, it is otherwise quite unique (as in the Netherlands, the number is one to forty).
Most of the distinctive Baltic cruises had an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can spend a couple of whole days in the historic city and return to the boat to sleep at night.
If you only go ashore using ship excursions, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some of the cruises have included Berlin in the brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and the trip there is therefore not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or if they have experienced a traumatic event.
There is nothing to be ashamed of, it is no different from other things that many people fear or dislike.
Gaining an understanding of how the airplane works and what occurs during flight can, for some, help to overcome a fear based on the unknown or on not having control.
Freight companies get a lot of money for delivering things quickly. Often, time is very significant when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On certain routes, the larger companies use their own planes, but for smaller companies, it was problematic.
If they sent things by air freight, it might have taken days on some routes to get through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked luggage. Airline regulations do not allow them to send luggage without a passenger, and this is where you come into the picture.
The obvious way to fly in first class or business class is to fork out a thick stack of money for the privilege (or even better, have your company do it for you).
However, this will not be cheap: As a rough rule of thumb, you can prepare to pay up to four times the usual economy price for business class, and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no point in looking for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain group of flyers who are willing to pay well to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and pay accordingly.
Chişinău is the capital of Moldova. Romanian is the local language, but Russian is also widely used.
The multiethnic republic of Moldova has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in Eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but it has not been recognized by any of the UN member states.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the 3rd largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million. Izmir is the second largest port after Istanbul and is a very good center for transport.
Smyrna was previously just an old town, but is now a modern, developed, and busy commercial center located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The broad avenues, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are drawn alongside traditional red sloping roofs, the 18th-century square along with old mosques and churches, even though the city has an atmosphere more akin to the European Mediterranean area than traditional Turkey.
One can see the island of Eysturoy from the village of Haldarsvík, which also has an unusual octagonal church.

In the north, you must also visit the vast crypt Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a place with Marian art that is popular all over the world.
Remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave site, in addition to a place that holds an almost immeasurable significance for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive today who survived their time here, and many more who loved those who were killed or worked to death there, both Jews and others.
Please treat the place with the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Please do not damage the area by marking or scratching graffiti into the structures.
Barcelona's official languages are both Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer Catalan, and most have an understanding of that language, but practically everyone can speak Spanish.
Most signs, however, are only in Catalan because it is legally established as the first official language.
Spanish is additionally used in public transport and other facilities, nevertheless.
Regular announcements at the Metro station are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system with a wide range of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The reputation of Parisians is that they are egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Even though it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to behave as well as possible, to act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). It will make it considerably easier to get around.
The quick facade of Parisians disappears quickly if you show a bit of basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered by a lot of forest, mainly beech, spruce, and fir trees, and is characterized by a mix of highland and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has an especially large variety of plant communities due to its range of microclimates, different soils, and varying levels of elevation.
The area also hosts a great many animal and bird species.
One rarely finds fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owls, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie, along with several common animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and shoulders.
Most monasteries offer shawls to women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially if it has bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Along the same lines, men are required to wear trousers that cover their knees.
This can also be borrowed from the storage at the entrance, but the clothes might not be washed after each user, so it may be less comfortable to wear these skirts. One size fits all!
Dishes in Mallorca, like in similar areas in the Mediterranean, are based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and use olive oil for everything.

All nouns that appear with the word Sie for you always start with a capital letter, even if it is in the middle of a sentence.
This is a significant method for being able to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It also undoubtedly makes reading easier, even though writing is a bit difficult, since one then has to figure out if a verb or adjective is used in a nominalized form.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters one must be aware of are c and g, as their pronunciation differs based on the following vowel.
In addition, you should be aware that the pronunciation of r and rr is different: caro means dear, while carro means cart.

Therefore, reading this grammar book will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand the sentences better.
If you already know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
People who know a little Spanish quickly find out that Portuguese is similar enough that one does not need to study it separately.
Premodern observatories are usually somewhat outdated in our time and are often used for museums or educational sites.
As light pollution was not the type of problem in their heyday that it is today, they are usually found in cities or at study sites that are more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The cherry blossoms that appear have been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century and are also known as hanami.
The concept came from China where blossoming plum flowers were the most popular flower.
The first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor in Japan solely for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
The plants look best in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally designed garden and pick some "samples," you will also be kicked out without discussion.
Singapore is usually a place with high safety, it is a very easy place to navigate, and you can get hold of most things there after you arrive.
But if you are placed in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you need to deal with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which does not occur as often).
There are also a couple of buses going north to the city of Hebron, to the traditional burial site where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, as well as their wives, are buried.
Make sure that the bus you want to take goes into Hebron and not just to the Jewish settlement Kiryat Arba, which is nearby.
The inland waterways can be a useful theme to base a trip on.
For example, visit the castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or take a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also provide routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays and is celebrated as Jesus' birthday.
Many of the traditions we have during the holiday season have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
It is a tradition to stay awake through the Easter night at an exposed point to watch the sunrise.
It may well have been a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual, but there are naturally also Christian theological interpretations of this tradition.
Several traditional churches often hold the Easter service on a Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with the congregations often starting the celebration of Christ's resurrection at midnight.
All animals that originally came to the islands did so by swimming, flying, or floating.
The mammals could not make the journey due to the long distance over to the continent, and thus the giant tortoise became the first grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Many mammals were introduced after humans arrived in the Galapagos, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in the winter, you'll experience the polar night, during which the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to discover the Aurora Borealis, as the sky remains dark more or less around the clock.
Since the places are sparsely populated and light pollution is rarely a problem, you will also have the opportunity to see the stars.
The work culture in Japan is more hierarchical and formal than Western people are used to.
A suit is the standard work attire, and employees address each other by last name or job titles.
