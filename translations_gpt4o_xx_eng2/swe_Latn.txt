The United States Gymnastics Federation supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and agrees that it is absolutely necessary for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs can be better served by moving forward with meaningful changes to our organization, rather than having the certification removed.

USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal - to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible, so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a secure, positive, and empowering environment.
Throughout the 1960s, Brzezinski worked as an advisor to John F. Kennedy and later for Lyndon B. Johnson's administration.
During the 1976 election, he was a foreign policy advisor for Carter, and later served as the National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981, following Henry Kissinger.
Just like the NSA, he assisted Carter in the diplomatic handling of global issues, such as the Camp David Accords in 1978; the normalization of relations between the U.S. and China in the late 1970s; the Iranian revolution, which led to the hostage crisis in Iran in 1979; and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.

It not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils often cannot give, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The researchers say that this animal's plumage was chestnut brown on the upper side, with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
As the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, known as a quill, but instead have other characteristics of feathers – barbs and barbules – the researchers concluded that the quill was likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flying but instead for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that the specimen shows an adult plumage rather than chick down, even though the tail comes from a young dinosaur.
The researchers suggested that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not juvenile down.
A car bomb that detonated at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than twenty other people.

They found that the sun operated according to the same basic principles as other stars: The activity of all stars in the system was found to be driven by their brightness, their rotation, and nothing else.
With the help of brightness and rotation, the star's Rossby number is determined, which has to do with plasma flows.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work carried out was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the research team was looking for would be caused by forces resembling the tides of the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The researchers managed to establish that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as regular matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located in a sort of halo and is made up of numerous small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new variant was "very worrying and alarming because of the very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have been infected by the bacteria at the hospital, believes Doctor Moll, of which at least two were hospital staff.
During the year, an infected person can transmit the infection to between 10 and 15 close contacts.
However, it seems that the proportion of those with XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis is still low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

Infrared images indicate that the temperature variations between night and day likely suggest that they are caves.
They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth, which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground," says Glen Cushing at the United States Geological Surveys (USGS) astrogeology team and at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed paper sheet with their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting document.
French electoral legislation codifies the approach quite strictly.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the start of the voting and that no envelopes are added except those duly counted from the eligible voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers who are under extensive supervision and follow specific procedures.

In her second race, the giant slalom, she finished in tenth place in her group for women, with a combined time of 4:41.30. It was 2:11.60 minutes slower than first place with the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth place with the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four skiers in the women's sitting group could not finish their runs and 45 of the total 117 participating skiers in the giant slalom did not manage to place in the competition.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Superintendent General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki announced that the accused appeared at the court with covered faces.
Although three people were in the house when the car collided with it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue services cut the driver out from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the hospital at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court with murdering her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but all eyewitness evidence may become worthless because her picture has been widely published.
This is common elsewhere in the UK but Scottish law operates differently and courts have regarded the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson at the University of Dundee states that "journalists choose a dangerous line if they publish pictures, etc., of suspects."
The Criminal Department (Crown Office), which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, has told journalists that no further comments will be made before charges.
According to the leak, the document concerns the border dispute, where the Palestinians want the borders to be based on those before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other subjects reportedly being discussed are the future of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel requests a ten-year constant military presence in the valley after an agreement has been signed, while the PA only agrees to allow such a presence for five years.
Hunters in the complementary experiment with pest control would be closely monitored by the park rangers, as the experiment was observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park conservation and culture at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting mission received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new provisional electoral council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth provisional electoral council in the span of four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended that the former provisional election council should resign, as part of a package of measures to bring the country closer to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that started in October.
The partially violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been overdue since 2011.
There have been reports of about 60 cases where incorrectly designed iPods have overheated, causing a total of six fires and inflicting minor burns on four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (Meti) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the units.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "minor."
The department responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "very regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The office of the Northern Mariana Islands' emergency services announced that no injuries have been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also announced that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several of the hostages have been rescued and at least six have so far been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later changed places with an elderly lady because she needed to visit the restroom. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births in his free time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would accelerate the maturation of the fetus's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators salvaged two "black boxes" on Wednesday.
Wrestling colleagues also praised Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first boss. Luna died during the night with two moons. Quite unique, just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said in a comment that "Luna was as much of a freak as I am ... maybe even more so ... love her and will miss her ... hopefully she is better off where she is now."
Of 1,400 people surveyed before the federal election in 2010, the number who were opposed to Australia becoming a republic had grown by 8 percent since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the campaign at the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the survey participants share this view, that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100 m and 200 freestyle as well as three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his troubles, there have been doubts about his fitness.
He has not been able to take the medications needed to overcome his pain as they are prohibited in the competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number so far, on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery with different hardware and software at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of Earth's water resources, along with organic material, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Since comets collided with Earth a long time ago, scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth was formed.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and last month signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would mean that planes fly shorter distances, save millions of liters of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport will be provided, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride stations are not available at ground level.
The fear of a lack of transportation opened up the possibility that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University reported that the new species developed in just two generations, although this process is believed to have taken much longer due to breeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant Española Darwin's finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
"It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called 'illuminated manuscripts.'"
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The juice from the cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH value is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Stir together the two dry powders. Then form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman society, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women stayed together.
When you call someone hundreds of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space with the help of a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and field of vision.
A giant rocket over 30 meters is required to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has brought is providing us with much easier and faster methods of transport.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Under them, there are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, everything from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray pet cats) that eat a much larger amount of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret behind their successes is the concept of a niche, a specific job for each cat that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats, and live in large groups called prides.
Herds consist of one to three related adult males together with as many as thirty females and young.
The females are often closely related to each other; a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lions behave much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (but not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is part of the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's loud roaring but more like a sentence of growling, screaming words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Researchers believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by scent, by sniffing the ground where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings and then pouncing on the prey.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they originate from (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they relocate to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they often end up in a different environment than the one they were previously in.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so in order to be a strong competitor, the new population needs different features or adaptations than they needed before.
The indigenous people have not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they start to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans emit (that is, exhale).
Plants produce food with the help of sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make our clothes from plants. Much of the food we eat is plants. Without the plants, the animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain during its time, so it had nothing to fear except other mosasaurs.
The long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the palate, which meant there was no chance of escape for anything that crossed its path.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that came into the water; even a gigantic dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
Even though most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their fair share of strange or unusual feast items such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and women ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men enjoyed having banquets together where they could recline on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained food that came to Europe from America or from Asia in later centuries.
They did not have corn, nor tomatoes, cocoa, or potatoes, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the god's home.
People brought offerings to the gods, and the priests tried to appease the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests had access to.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, known as ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors.
Women cooked food in the yard; shops were just open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests; therefore, wood was very precious.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland as punishment for murder, and that when he traveled westward, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at the time.
Even though each country was "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the peoples, the kings, the customs, and the history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Even if there is something on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776." The text is shown on the bottom of the document, upside down.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we know that the large parchment (measuring 75.6 cm x 62.2 cm) was rolled up for storage early in its existence.
So it's likely that the text was only written there as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was governed by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who had reached an agreement with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1944, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces had liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis," which means citizen, and "civitas," which means city or city-state, and also in some way defines the size of the society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. A civilized culture means that knowledge is transferred across multiple generations, a lingering cultural footprint, and a fair distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces and are not recognized as real civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the only component - according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked any power to impose taxes and, as there was no national executive power or judiciary, it fell to the state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to carry out all its decisions.
Nor did it have the authority to revoke tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all states before they could be added, and the states attached so little importance to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, together with the German football team, is the world's second most successful team and was the champion in the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (of which the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
With its many islands, Japan is often considered an archipelago in geographical terms.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, which means beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiated a transformation of the original grain production, employing Chinese workers to work on the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After the defeat in 1895 in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which sovereignty over Taiwan is given to Japan, which then rules over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by the formats of photo sensors in digital cameras.
The 35-millimeter format is, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio in this format (divide by twelve to achieve the simplest whole number relation) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, APS format) correspond to this aspect ratio or are close to it.
The much-abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a certain order in an image.
It is claimed that the best placement for the subject is where the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally intersect (see the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was scrutinized.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had united European states despite their differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main doctrines of Christianity states that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's funds are intended for precisely that purpose.
The central power of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the conflict broke out, the United Kingdom initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective in cutting off necessary military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated widely accepted international law as codified in multiple international agreements over the past two hundred years.
The United Kingdom mined international waters to prevent all ships from crossing entire areas of the sea, making it risky even for neutral ships.
Since they received a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among most residents and countries was pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, countries wanted to avoid a repetition of such a situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States of America in 1884 to start working at Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
The old China had a unique way of distinguishing different time periods; each stage in China's history, or each family that held power, was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also an unstable period where the provinces were divided. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms, which took place during the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, violent warfare often occurred among many noblemen fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China's history when thousands of people died in the struggle to sit on the highest throne in the great palace in Xi'an.
There were many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not a single ruler.
Furthermore, the professions were opened up to all male applicants, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to achieve success.
The same applies to the military, as rank within the army was now based on caliber instead of class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed individuals from the working class in other countries to start revolutions.
Muhammed was deeply interested in subjects beyond his everyday life. He often used to visit a cave that became known as "Hira" on the "Noor" mountain (light) to contemplate.
The cave itself, which survived the passage of time, gives a very clear picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave, which is located on one of the mountain peaks north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It is actually not easy to find even if you know it exists. Inside the cave, there is total isolation.
There is nothing to be seen other than the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Pyramid of Cheops is one of many large pyramidal structures constructed to honor deceased pharaohs.
Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tomb monuments, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Pyramid of Cheops was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The marking for "up-bow" looks like a V and the marking for "down-bow" like a bracket or a square missing the bottom side.
Up means that you should begin at the tip and push the bow upwards, and down means that you should begin at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and draw the bow downwards.
An upstroke usually generates a softer sound, while a downstroke is stronger and more resolute.
Feel free to add your own markings, but remember that the printed bow markings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a crowd of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd shouting and yelling threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows wide open.
At one point, one of the participants in the mob swung the head of an imperial guard who had been killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses for the American imperialism's conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the cost and interest on bonds in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street's banks.
Of course, the substantial profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the fundamental gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era during which the events took place is often called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history from the 11th century to the 13th century.
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which formally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses many different ideas in practice, from the notion that technology drives development or the technological imperative to the strict view that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic associated with the laws of nature and how they are manifested in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are original rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the motor-driven car inevitably leads to the construction of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically sustainable for just a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare to repair injured bodies.
The Romantic period contained a large element of determinism originating from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, geography shaped individuals and over time customs and cultures related to this geography emerged, and these, which harmonized with the location of the society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began to circulate around the year 400 AD and continued until about the year 1100 AD.
Its influence declined during the 14th century primarily due to the fact that crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices which were valued more highly than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 12th-13th century and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slow communication routes, styles in the West could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was that people began using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is agriculture conducted to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often ecological system that uses saved seeds originating from the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by society and allow them to find their identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be of linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographical nature, or it can be a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinct and symbolic style choice, which includes fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accident, or deliberate abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their upbringing.
Such children are called "feral." Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to parents rejecting a child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wilderness entirely on their own.
When the wild child is raised entirely by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely identical to those of the specific caregiver animal, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, remedial teaching goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a support for individuals who are learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of support, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is internalized in the software and is intended to question, guide, and explain methods that may have been too challenging for the student to manage on their own.
Children are placed in foster homes for many different reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, or educational, but it happens.
We consider the foster care system to be a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster homes are meant to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home they previously came from.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions regarding user theory.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motives for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Even 'personal engagement' and 'continuous relationships' were identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites."
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial expressions that last a few milliseconds.
It is specifically claimed that one can determine if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks demonstrated in his essay "The President's Speech" how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even claims that we share such knowledge in interpreting human behavior with animals like domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variations back and forth between the two poles for each new generation.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its need for amino acids from the plants that are available.
Furthermore, a lack of this leads to serious consequences; stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant resources would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
As a comparison, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest but also offers high-quality proteins containing all essential amino acids.
When all is said and done, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as chimpanzees on the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly thereafter (10–60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you closer to consciousness without fully waking you.
If you tend to turn off the alarm in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, so that you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives involve drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleep, which makes you have to get up and pee.
The amount of inner peace a person has inversely correlates with the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the present life force is. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded with the path of love within Mahayana and many techniques within Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
With kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The god yoga is central to Tibetan meditation. Through the visualization of various gods, the energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and enlightened awareness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to collaboration between the Soviet Union and the USA. When the war ended, the differences in systems, process, and culture led to the collapse of the countries' cooperation.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would continue for the next 40 years and would be physically fought through contract armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been shattered, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland and simultaneously violated the peace treaty of Riga, the non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Poland, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The by far most effective way to move large amounts of people and goods across the seas is to use ships for transporting cargo.
The traditional job of the navies has been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to transport your people and goods, while simultaneously disrupting the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans attempted to move troops and material across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily with the help of submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been domesticated first about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes had them for milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in flocks that roamed on hills or other pasture areas, often herded by shepherds who were often children or young people, similar to the more well-known shepherd. These herding methods are still used today.
Tramways for carriages were built in England as early as the 1500s.
Even though the wagon ways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve higher speeds and carry larger loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of that time.
Sleepers were introduced quite early to hold the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they had a layer of iron on top.
This became the practice, but the iron wore more on the wooden wheels of the carts.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first all-iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transport was walking; humans began to walk upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus (which means the upright human) saw the light of day.
Their predecessor, Australopithecus, was not in the habit of walking upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can engage in the environmental movement, and we can also become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is in many cases like symptomatic treatment. But if we don't just want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is abundantly clear that the world has changed greatly due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and the problems have worsened due to overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
After it had been adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's print shop a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 broadsides by Dunlap known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The handwritten original has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and remains today. We call them birds.
Many do not think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like those of the dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary digits.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these digits are called binary digits - or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning is not always immediately noticeable. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general for an immediate diagnosis to be made.
The best sign of poisoning may be an open jar of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term beetles is used in a formal sense by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term originates from ancient kinship with bedbugs, insects that are sharply adapted to parasitize humans.
Both assassin bugs and bedbugs are inhabitants, adapted to live in their host's nest or home.
In the USA, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple can decide that it is not in their interest, or in the best interest of their children, to raise a child.
These couples may choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method is guiding in almost all research.
However, it is not alone. Experimenting, where an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions, and making observations also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's view on all scientific questions, including psychology, was accepted.
When the knowledge of Greek diminished, the Western world found itself cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often largely depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are not just reactions to external periodic signals have been documented in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that repeats its cycle over a period even in the absence of external influence.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the primary indications that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments that labeled either the subject's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the subject's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells can be inherited by children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of experiencing the landscape, including its plant and animal life.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, as well as visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit, photograph, and learn more about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns in cars to go to their jobs and are passed by others whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle service, everyone is in some way connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on private car usage.
Science now shows that this massive coal economy has disrupted the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human development over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system. Virtually everyone complains about the transportation system.
In industrialized countries, one seldom hears similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of how individual drivers and vehicles move between two points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because driving behaviors cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave fairly consistently; thus, traffic tends to flow somewhat consistently and can largely be represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, connections have been established between three main variables: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These conditions are helpful in the planning, designing, and operation of facilities along the roads.
The insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and to find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
This gives them more small spaces where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some people believed he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and also the other stars).
This seems reasonable, since it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the world's most water-rich and second longest river. Its water flow is more than 8 times greater than that of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, 9 km wide in some places.
A full 20 percent of the water flowing into the oceans from the world's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main course of the Amazon River is 6,387 km. It receives its water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Even though the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and construction techniques of the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed.
The New Kingdom's ancient Egyptians marveled at their predecessors' monuments, which at that time were well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has around 800 inhabitants. It is the world's smallest independent country and the country with the lowest number of inhabitants.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have been aware of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as these can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything consisted of one or more of a total of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four phases of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he had theories that they switch to new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many different elements in the periodic table.
Substances such as calcium and potassium are classified as metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic substances such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a faithful companion for many people when it came out.
When newer writing methods have been developed, unfortunately, the pencil has received lower status and fewer areas of use.
Today, people write messages on computer screens and never need to come near a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that energy is required to create a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. Splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, and it doesn't take much for them to decay.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the nearby side because the crust is thinner there. This made it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories revolve around finding out what motivates people or what appeals to them.
The theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they become adults.
These theories look at what makes some people want what they want and what in their environment causes them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors may emerge when managers start to lead their former peers. At one end of the spectrum, the manager tries to remain "one of the gang."
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, assign responsibilities, and hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one turns into an unrecognizable person who feels that he or she must change everything the team has done and make it their own.
When all is said and done, the leader is ultimately responsible for whether the team succeeds or fails.
This behavior often results in divisions between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams maintain the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members tend to function as a point of contact for the physical group.
They often have more to say than conventional team members since different time zones can affect when their team can meet, and this might not be understood by local management.
The presence of a truly "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management group to which all members report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal of starting to use organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in an organization's functional departments, creativity and inventiveness can flourish.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must create an innovation culture as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to support organizations in achieving a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological information provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, it narrows the research field and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain diseases and behavior supports researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, diseases, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technology allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we have not seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models which help us understand processes in our mind.
Even though AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that involves the behavior, learning, and intelligence of machines.
Research in AI is about getting machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and queries, and also recognition of handwriting, voice, and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on offering solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now commonly used in finance, medicine, technology, and the military, and has been integrated into several home computers and video game software applications.
Field studies are a large part of the teaching in every class. Often, the teacher wants to take the students to places where there are no bus routes.
The technology offers solutions with virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
To share a study trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on a journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet school in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital; the website is redesigned each year, but previous versions are kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, and the presence of readers generally improves this.
Since students are often the most critical readers, the blogger tries to write better in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging "also forces students to become more aware of the world." The requirement to cater to readers' interests stimulates students to be sharp and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that provides inspiration for collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can give students the opportunity to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet material, students can define their positions in relation to what others have written, as well as account for their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and offers a range of galleries and museums that showcase Canada's present and past.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and in the northern part is Muskoka's beautiful, untouched nature.
All of this and more distinguishes Ontario with what outsiders consider to be the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas further north are very sparsely populated, and some are nearly uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent of its own in terms of fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or belong to France, and are known as luxury resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to the areas, which had a significant impact in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope and thereby found the sea route from Europe to India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's good to also wear a ring (not just one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they would consider as harassment, and it is not uncommon for someone to follow you, grab your arm, etc.
Be firm when you say no to men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences do not make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city of Daru l-Badya, which was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tagine, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole spectrum of knick-knacks, but it’s all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located at the far east near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the central parts.
Goma is fairly safe, but if one plans to visit outside of Goma, one should investigate the situation with the conflicts in the northern Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price for the short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, remote places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was included on the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to the threat from desert sands.
It was one of the major stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS program Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the other cities in the country, with an atmosphere that is more Arabic than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each housing different wildlife.
It is one of the major attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship among South African national parks (SANParks).
Just like all other South African national parks, the park charges daily conservation and entrance fees.
It can also be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access either to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The buildings in a row that make up the silhouette of Hong Kong have been likened to a glittering bar chart enhanced by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views in Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon's waterfront opposite.
The vast majority of the development on Hong Kong Island is densely packed on former seabed along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers took over, so if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world and extends 80 km into Bangladesh and the Indian mainland from the coast.
Sundarbans has been inscribed on UNESCO's World Heritage List. The part of the forest that lies on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps — they contain some of the last remaining habitats of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one-third consists of wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 axis deer in the area.
Buses depart from the central bus station (across the river) all day, but most, especially those heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since buses between the districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two walkways that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs stations are expected to be completed.
Guaraní was the most significant indigenous group that inhabited what is now eastern Paraguay and lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived as hunters, gatherers, and fishermen.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Province of the Indies," was born as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and groups from the indigenous native population.
The Spaniards began the colonization period that lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well-known for their polo teams and players being among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where you can buy tickets to polo matches, turn to the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the value of which corresponds to the value of a British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
GBP is generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, it is often fine to pay with credit cards and USD.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted on the remote islands, but British and American currency may be accepted; contact the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is nearly impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; during the summer months, it is common to have temperatures over +30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely falls below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer suggests.
There are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Despite many of the animals in the park being accustomed to seeing humans, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you should stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they appear, bison, moose, caribou, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep an adequate distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking food that smells and keep the camp clean.
Samoa's capital is called Apia. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a notorious standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and the United Kingdom refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town led to the murder of the high chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches due to Auckland’s location between two harbors. The most popular beaches are divided into three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and on most of them, the mānuka offers shade.
Tamaki Drive's beaches are located at Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes well-visited family beaches with a good range of shops located by the shore. Swimming is safe.
The primary local beer is "Number one," which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines, but the New Zealand and Australian wines might withstand the journey better.
The local drinking water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is unknown. A "short black" is "espresso", cappuccino has a heap of cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate milk meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
There are many trips made to the reef year-round, and damage to the reef due to any of these causes is rare.
Still, take the authorities' advice, heed all signs, and be very attentive to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes also be found at other times.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
The primary habitat of the saltwater crocodile is in the river mouths north of Rockhampton, so they usually do not live in the sea.
Booking in advance gives the traveler security and an assurance that they will have somewhere to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it may be possible to book other types of accommodations, such as campgrounds, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, transfers to and from the airport, and even package tours that combine flights and hotel accommodations.
They can also hold your reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or gather additional documents required for your destination (e.g., a visa).
All changes and requests should, however, go through the travel agency first, and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the overwhelming majority of the music festival's visitors decide to camp on site, and most visitors see it as an important part of the experience.
If you want to be near where things are happening, you have to come early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even though the music performances on the main stage have ended, parts of the festival may continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in the winter, check the cabin's location, as going through ice causes really horrible noises for those most affected.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see terms and conditions).
Casinos often do everything they can to get guests to spend as much time and money as possible. There are often no windows or clocks, and the exits are often hard to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and encourage them to stay on the premises.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages for free. But intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Everyone who will be driving at high latitudes or over mountain passes should be aware that snow, ice, and below freezing temperatures may occur.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low, and you cannot drive in the same way as on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short time for you to get stuck.
Visibility can also be limited by snowfall or snowdrift or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the largest tourism industry in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular use refers to traveling across the country to see the magnificent African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Certain animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to cars, and with standard equipment, it is possible to see them well.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are occasionally shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
Walking safari (also called "bush walk" and "hiking safari") consists of walking either for a few hours or over several days.
The Paralympics will take place between August 24 and September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, as it hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies due to the coronavirus vary, but by the end of March, most do not extend as far as July 2020, when the Olympic Games were supposed to begin.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a typical ticket price around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that can be borrowed, even if they are not in the room.
If no iron is available, or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if one is at hand.
Be vigilant and do not let the fabric become too hot (which can cause shrinking or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil the water for one minute, in others, several minutes are required.
Filters can vary in effectiveness, and if you are unsure, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from an established company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Pests can destroy food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people with violence are usually not classified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods without tax or other additions in certain places.
Travelers going to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often runs through isolated forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, drive sensibly: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves are common occurrences.
Posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections - typically 56-64 km/h (35-40 mph) - and adhering to them is even more important than usual.
Strangely enough, mobile coverage is much better here than along many other routes, e.g., Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are really delicious, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those from the neighbor to the south, Austria.
Pastries with fruit are common, with apples baked into pastries year-round and cherries and plums during the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but mighty pastries, you can try what, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry dishes; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a collective term that encompasses a wide variety of regional dishes spread throughout the country.
But if it is used without a determiner, the term tends to mean the food that originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese culinary art, now available throughout the island nation, offers an array of simply spiced dishes, where the flavorings most used by the Javanese are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese palm sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can pose a safety risk as the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but gets a foot caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First of all, most riders have boots with heels and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars to ensure a stirrup detaches from the saddle if it is pulled backward by a rider who falls off.
Cochamó Valley, Chile's premier climbing destination, is known as the Yosemite of South America, and has a number of large granite cliffs and walls.
The mountain peaks offer views that can take your breath away. Climbers from all corners of the world are constantly creating new routes among the countless mountain walls.
Downhill skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports where one glides down a snow-covered landscape with skis or a snowboard strapped to their feet.
Skiing is an activity that attracts many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums", who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a specific area.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date as far back as 5,000 B.C.!
Alpine skiing as a sport has existed at least since the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: this activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related to but usually does not involve alpine skiing or mountain climbing, the latter performed in steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as you would a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover greater distances than when walking – but you will rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control on multiple occasions.
However, the Schengen area functions somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport controls multiple times.
In a similar way, if you have a Schengen visa you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen member country separately. You thus save both time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured objects are antiques. Some tax authorities define items older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limits may be shorter in, for example, North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, even though they are not as old as similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sami, and the culture surrounding the trade is significant even for many with other professions.
However, historically, not all Sami people have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but have lived off fishing, hunting and the like, and used the reindeer mostly as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi people work in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi people's area.
Even though it is often used, especially among non-Romani, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Romani people.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to a travel restriction, your travel medical insurance or cancellation protection may be affected.
You may also wish to consult governments other than your own, but their advice is tailored for their own residents.
For example, different circumstances may apply to American citizens in the Middle East compared to Europeans or Arabs.
A travel advisory is merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The image presented is often hasty, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available from other sources.
Extremely weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomena with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruptions, or loss of human life.
Difficult weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different variations of them, which may depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind, hail, heavy precipitation, and wildfire are types and consequences of extreme weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, downbursts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include intense snowstorms, blizzards, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risk of severe weather affecting their area, as it may impact travel plans.
Everyone who plans to visit a country that might be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An Internet search for "hostile environment training" will probably provide the address of a local company.
A course usually goes through all the questions mentioned here but in much more detail, often with practical exercises.
A course normally lasts between 2-5 days and includes role play, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
There are plenty of books on how to survive in the wilderness, whereas books about war zones are rare.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without a specified gender (X) or documents updated to match a desired name or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies just as much.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become significantly more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Transgender individuals who have not undergone surgery should not expect to pass through the X-ray screening with their integrity and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the returning flow from waves that break off at the shore, often by a reef or similar.
The topology underwater causes the return flow to be concentrated in a few deeper parts, and strong currents leading to deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion after attempting to swim back upstream, which can be impossible.
As soon as you come out of the current, it's not harder than normal to swim back.
Try to aim somewhere where you don't get stuck again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been discovered, wait to be rescued.
The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (there isn't as much of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to new cultures sometimes have difficulty readapting to their original culture.
Upon returning from living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show of the pyramids is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually, you always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The sound and light story is just like a fairy tale.
The background consists of the Sphinx, which tells a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, of which sixteen were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded crater of an active volcano forms a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, and borders the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains here merge with the plateau and then reappear to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains, which are divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif, with its highest peak at 4,892 m in Mount Vinson.
In remote locations without mobile coverage, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone generally does not replace a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make calls.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that require remote data and communications.
Your local telecommunications operator should be able to provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
To travel and learn is an increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year.
This is particularly popular among recent graduates, allowing them to take a year off before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year course abroad can actually increase the chances of being accepted into higher education in your home country.
Usually, a fee is charged to register for these educational programs.
Finland is very boat-friendly. The land of a thousand lakes also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelagos.
In the archipelago and the lakes, you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Even though the archipelagos and the largest lakes are certainly large enough for any pleasure yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak can offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seventh or eighth person.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands, the figure is one in forty).
Most of the specifically Baltic cruises include a longer stopover in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic town for a couple of full days while returning to and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore on ship excursions, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises include the German capital Berlin in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people, regardless of age and background, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fear and aversion to other things that many people have.
Understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help some people overcome a fear that stems from discomfort with the unknown or from not being in control.
Courier companies are well-paid to deliver things quickly. Time is often very important when it comes to business documents, trade goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On certain routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, there was a problem.
If they have sent items by air freight, on certain routes it may have taken several days to go through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline rules don't allow you to send baggage without a passenger, and this is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to shell out a whole lot of money for the privilege (or even better, let your company do it for you).
However, this does not come at a cheap price: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy price for business class and eleven times for first class!
In general, there's no point in even searching for discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of travelers who are willing to pay well for the privilege of traveling somewhere quickly and comfortably. The companies also charge accordingly.
Moldova's capital is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is commonly spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been affected by ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any of the member countries of the UN.
The economic relations have been restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite setbacks in the political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
The city, which in historical times was called Smyrna, is today a modern, developed city and a bustling commercial center located by a vast harbor surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers are mixed with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more similar to Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village Haldarsvík offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble statues of doves over some of the graves.
It is worth wandering around for half an hour in the captivating village.
Within reach to the north is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after a glowing account of its grandeur by Lord Byron.
Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, also visit the fantastic Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (shrine), a place world-renowned for the apparitions of Mary.
Remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave site and a place that has an almost immeasurable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death here; Jews as well as non-Jews.
Use the website with the great dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the place by painting or scratching graffiti on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half the population prefers to speak Catalan, an overwhelming majority understands it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
Most of the signs, however, are only in Catalan, as it is by law the primary official language.
However, Spanish is also used in many places in public transportation and other establishments.
Regular announcements in the subway are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Even though this is often just an incorrect stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to behave properly and act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). It will make getting around significantly easier.
The Parisians' brusque exterior will quickly disappear if you show your polite side.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered with dense forest, mainly beech, spruce, and silver fir, and has a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably large biodiversity, due to the extent of microclimates, different soils, and varying altitudes.
The area is also home to an extreme diversity of animal and bird species.
Rare animal species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie are found there, along with many more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover the knees and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide scarves to women who haven't prepared in advance, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
According to the same logic, men must wear trousers that cover the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the stockroom at the entrance, but the garments are not washed after each person, so you might not feel comfortable using these skirts. One size fits all applies to men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that in similar areas around the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (particularly pork) and consistently uses olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato, and optional available toppings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as Sie for the pronoun you, are written with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
According to some, this also makes it easier to read, although the need to figure out whether a verb or adjective is in noun form makes writing slightly more complicated.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies based on the following vowel.
Also make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means cart.
Persian has relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, you can get good help with learning a lot about Persian grammar and understanding sentences better if you read this basic grammar book.
Naturally, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese if you already know a Romance language.
But people who know a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it does not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually outdated today and remain as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution during their heyday was not the type of problem it is today, they are usually located in cities or on university campuses, easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities located in remote places with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami, or the viewing of cherry blossoms, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where they used plum blossoms.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor exclusively for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so try to resist the temptation to remove “just one” specimen.
If you visit an arranged garden, and you pick a "specimen," it will also get you thrown out, without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to be and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything upon arrival.
But with its location in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you must contend with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also a small number of buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial site where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives rest.
Check that the bus you are considering taking goes to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good starting point for planning a holiday around.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or take a boat trip to interesting cities on the Danube or a tour along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as Jesus' birthday.
Many of the traditions around the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition to spend the Easter night awake at an open place to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil service on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend. At midnight, the congregation then breaks up to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands got here by either swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals could not make their way over, and therefore the giant tortoise became the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived on the Galápagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions during the winter, you will experience polar nights, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a great opportunity to see the northern lights, as the sky is dark more or less around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners might be accustomed to.
A suit is the normal business attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, where the emphasis is placed on collective efforts rather than highlighting individual achievements.
Workers often need to obtain their superiors' approval for any decisions they make and are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without hesitation.
