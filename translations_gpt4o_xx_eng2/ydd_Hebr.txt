This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory which is already widespread, but also adds details that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the creature's fur was chestnut-brown on top with a bright orange underside.
The finding also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but did have other features of feathers – barbs and barbules – the researchers decided that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying but for regulating temperature or for display. The researchers argue that, although this is the leg of a young dinosaur, the sample shows feathers of an adult and not of a bird.
The researchers have suggested that, even though this is the fossil of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not a chick's feathers.

They have found that the Sun operates on the same main principles as other stars: it has been discovered that the activity of all stars in the system is driven by their brightness, their rotation, and nothing else.
The brightness and spin are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is associated with the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with regard to magnetic cycles.

The work that was done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made from the Sagittarius galaxy.
The result that the team was looking for would have been caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon has gravitational pull, which brings great waves, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the ninth astrological sign (Sagittarius) galaxy.
The researchers were able to conclude that dark matter influences other dark matter in the same way that regular matter does.
The theory says that most dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy in some sort of shell and is made of many small parts.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, place a pre-printed piece of paper indicating the candidate they choose into an envelope.
After officials confirm the voter's identity, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.

Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no ballots are present at the beginning of the voting and that no ballots are added except those from the duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under heavy surveillance, following specific procedures.

In her other race, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's session group with a combined running time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place finisher, Austria's Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place finisher, Hungary's Gyöngyi Dani.
Four skiers in the women's seating group failed to finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the giant slalom failed to sort in the chase.
The Madhya Pradesh police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General of the KRI says, "We have arrested five people who attacked the Swiss woman and have recovered her mobile and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kandar, Bhuta Kandar, Rampra Kandar, Gaza Kandar, and Vishnu Kandar.
Police Superintendent Shandara Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with covered faces.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed in, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious injuries to his head.
The street where the crash occurred was temporarily closed while rescue agencies freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred from the accident site to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekalya has since been in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with the murder of her son.
She is in arrest/custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any firsthand evidence may be redacted because her image has been widely publicized.
This is a familiar procedure elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish law operates differently and courts have viewed the publication of images as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that journalists seem to walk a dangerous line if they publish images, etc., of suspects.
The Crown Office, which is ultimately responsible for prosecutions, indicated to journalists that further comments should not be made at least until indictment.
The document, according to the statement, will discuss the border conflicts that Palestine wants based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics covered are reported to include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both peoples, and the Jordan Valley problem.
The State of Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years from when the agreement is signed, while the PA only agrees to allow such a presence for five years.
Gunshots in the supplementary festival control test will have been closely monitored by rangers, as the test was followed up and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director for park conservation and heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the initial shooting operation have received comprehensive safety and training instruction.
Martelly swore in a new temporary Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
It is Mortel's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dismissal of the former CEO as part of a package of measures to bring the country to new elections.
The commissions were Martley's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The increasingly violent protests were driven by a failure to hold elections, some of which were already scheduled since 2011.
Approximately 60 incidents of non-working iPods overheating have been reported, causing a number of six fires and leaving four people with mild burns.
The Ministry of Finance, Trade, and Industry (METI) of Japan said that there have been about 27 accidents related to the planes.
Last week, METI announced that Apple informed them of another 34 incidents of overheating, which the company called "serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report truly "regrettable."
The earthquake shook Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said that no damages were reported to the public.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no evidence of any tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six neighborhoods, including children and the elderly, were released early, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman as she needed to use the lavatory. Mendoza was later shot down.
Ligins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in the medical field.
He was trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
During the time he worked in the hospital, Liggins began researching premature labor in his spare time.
His previous work suggests that if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate the child's fetal lung maturation.
Zinhow has reported that government investigators received two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Colleague wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Very unique just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as crazy as we were... maybe even more... love her and I will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed for the 2010 general elections, those who support Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Australia's Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the campaign of the 2010 federal election that she believes Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the members in the survey agree and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was set to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in the three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his health condition became a concern.
He couldn't take the necessary drugs to overcome his pain since they are banned from the games.
Kurtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number today on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was reported on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of sending water to the Earth along with organic matter which can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets crashed into the Earth long ago.
Kauma, 53, began his governorship earlier in the year and signed a bill last month that legalized same-sex marriages.
He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
He is considered to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to accurately locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There are no additional transport services and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on site.
Fear of a shortage in transportation has raised the possibility that the game will have to be played behind closed doors without any team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new type of creature was formed in only two generations, even though it is assumed that the process took much longer, due to interbreeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of forms; it can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wires, which can be bent and braided. It can be hammered and spun into sheets.
It can be made very thin and inserted into other metal. It can be made so thin that it was once used to cover the hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called a chemist's pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (basic) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons have been stripped from them (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean wet hands, press it into a ball.
The moisture on your hand will react with the outer layers, which will feel different and form a kind of surface.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every dwelling, connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remains of drainage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilizations, toilets were often part of an open bathing room where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in the spheres receives the signal and then reflects it back down, almost on the minute.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Researchers use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere slightly distorts our light and visual power.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet tall to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in extraordinary ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is providing much easier and faster transportation.
It brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Under them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from hares to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many little cats (including free pet cats) that eat the far more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the thought of the niche, a special trait that every cat possesses that keeps it from fighting with others.
The lions are the most social cats, which live in large groups and are called prides.
Pride consists of one to three related adult males, together with as many as thirty females and young children.
The women are usually closely connected to one another, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
The pride of lions behave very similarly to groups of wolves or dogs, animals which are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in their behavior, and are also very lethally engaged with their prey.
A good athlete from all sides, the tiger can crawl (though not well), swim, jump over great distances, and pull with five times as much strength as a strong person.
The tiger is in the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a phrase of snarling, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch moles, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all of the ocelot's prey are much smaller than it.
Scientists think that ocelots still find food to eat by smell, sensing where it has been on the ground.
They can see very well at night with night vision and move very stealthily. Ocelots catch their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) is separated from the main population they originate from (such as if they move across mountains or water, or if they settle on a new island and cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
The new environment has different resources and different competitions, so the new population will need different means and changes to be a strong competition than what they previously required.
The original population has not changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new presence, they start to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same kind.
We call this process speciation, which means solely the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in, and they take in carbon dioxide that people breathe out.
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also create shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is from plants. Without plants, animals could not exist.
The Mussaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing except other Mussaurus.
Its long mouth was equipped with more than 70 knife-sharp teeth, along with an extra set on the roof of the mouth, meaning that it was impossible for anything that crossed its path to escape.
We do not know for sure, but it might have had a forked tongue. Its diet included cephalopods, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it might have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was not a match for it.
Although most of their food would have been familiar to us, the Romans did have some interesting or unfamiliar foods, including wild boar, peacock, snail, and a creature known as dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the women ate their food while sitting on benches, the rich folks preferred to have banquets together where they could recline on their sides while they ate their meals.
Ancient meals could not include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have carrots, not tomatoes, not potatoes, not cocoa, and an old Roman once tried a Turkish.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the dwelling of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to serve the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple has an open temple courtyard and then an inner area where only the priests can enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be a part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special protection for God.
In the warm climates of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family happened openly under the sky.
Women cooked in the yard; shops are now open with tables looking out onto the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, therefore wood was terribly expensive.
Greenland was settled harshly. In the Norse legends, they say that Erik the Red was expelled from Iceland because of murders, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at the time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've ever watched the movie National Treasure, it's possible that you think a treasure map is written under the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Although there is something written on the bottom side of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Freedom dated 4th of July 1776." The words appear at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that initially the large-format document (measuring ¾29 inches by ½24 inches) was rolled up for storage.
If so, it is likely that the note was added simply as a label.
The D-Day invasion and the subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was dominated by the "Vichy" French, who were French people that made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1944, the Allies attacked southern France, the attack was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the American and Free French forces liberated Southern France and then advanced towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant large group of people who live and work together cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civis, meaning human, connected to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and this also reflects the greatness of the community.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. A civilized culture means transmitting knowledge through dozens of generations, cultural progress that is sustained, and equal dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as legitimate civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—with Congress being the only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress did not have the power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, which often were not cooperative, to enforce all its laws.
It also did not have the authority to override tax laws and tariffs between countries.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states valued the central government so little that their contributions were often absent.
Italy's national football team, together with Germany's national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are mostly popular in the northern region, with Italians competing in international games at Olympic events.
Japan consists of close to 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to its cluster/group of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical standpoint, as an "archipelago."
Taiwan's beginning goes back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In the year 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in indigenous grain production practices, and providing work for Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty's (1644-1912) forces captured control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan to be a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which they ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machupicchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings by the banks of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most well-known still image photography format in the world is the 35 millimeter, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but much more important than this is the aspect ratios inherited by the digital camera image censor formats.
The 35mm setup is straight, somewhat confusing, 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
The aspect ratio of the display (divide by twelve to get the simplest whole-number ratio) was therefore said to be 3:2.
Many well-known formats (such as the APS family of formats) are either equivalent to or closely approximate this aspect ratio.
The heavily used and often mocked instruction of thirds is a simple instruction that creates liveliness while maintaining a semblance of order in an image.
It says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds in length and width (see example).
Throughout the epoch in European history, the Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, came under critical scrutiny.
Over a thousand years ago, the Christian religion compelled European states together despite the differences in language and customs.
His pervasive power affected everyone from the king to the common citizen.
One of the Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's funds are specifically there for this purpose.
The central authority of the church has already been in Rome for over a thousand years, and its concentration of power from money has led to many questions about whether this belief has been fulfilled.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain made a naval blockade for Germany.
The strategy has proven to be effective, cutting off important military and civilian facilities, even though the blockade was against the accepted international law codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
England has mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the sea, causing danger even to neutral ships.
Because there was a limited reaction to the tactic, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
The prevailing sentiments of most citizens and peoples throughout the 1920s were of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and cruelties of war during the First World War, nations wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a job with the Edison company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; every phase of China or every family that was in power was a unique dynasty.
Also, between each dynasty, there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, occurring for 60 years between the Han and the Jin dynasty.
Throughout the ages, fierce wars occurred between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The 'Three Kingdoms' was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people perishing while fighting to occupy the highest seat in the imperial palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political consequences such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to humanity and not to just one leader.
Even after the revolution, positions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same goes for the military because instead of army ranks being based on class, they are now based on caliber/knowledge.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed workers from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters outside of his ordinary life. He often used to go to a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain "Nur" (Light) to contemplate.
He himself was impressed, having survived the times, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual desires.
Located above one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find, even though someone knows it exists. Once it is in the hole, it is a total isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, magnificent sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of the world can be seen or heard from within the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the many pyramid structures constructed to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, has several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was made in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up arrow" sign looks like a V and the "down arrow sign" looks like a staple or like a box missing its bottom side.
Up means you should start at the end and push the sticks, and down means you should start at the frog (this is where your hand grips the sticks) and drag the sticks.
An up-bow usually produces a softer sound, while a down-bow is stronger and more defined.
Feel free to insert your own symbols, but remember the printed bending marks are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced on October 6, 1789, to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris, being surrounded by a mob that screamed and shouted threats against the king and queen.
The masses forced the king and queen to have their carriage windows wide open.
Somewhere a member of the crowd cracked the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of U.S. imperialism in the occupation of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover a large part of the costs and interest on bonds made in the name of the Philippine government by the Wall Street banking houses.
Certainly, the great profits derived from the long exploitation of the Filipino population would constitute the main benefit of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the content that led to the development of the order.
The times when the occasions took place are often referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages come after the Early Middle Ages and before the Late Middle Ages, which generally ends around 1500.
Technological willingness is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in implementation, from technological push or the technological demand to a strong feeling that human destiny is guided by an internal logic connected with scientific laws and their development in technology.
Most translations of technological terms encompass the same two general ideas: that the development itself usually follows a trajectory largely outside of cultural or political effect, and that technology, in turn, "impacts" societies that are inherited and not subject to social conditions.
For example, one could say that the motor car automatically leads to the development of highways.
However, a nationally extensive road network is not economically feasible for only a handful of cars, therefore new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
A high number of car owners also leads to a higher occurrence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the development of new techniques in the medical field for healing injured bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determination, drawn out by writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography merged with individuals, and over time customs and cultures connected to that geography emerged, and these, being at peace with the place of society, were better than irrationally determined laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of ancient Europe.
It is known for being a center of luxury starting around 400 A.D. and continued until around 1100 A.D.
The status of it was diminished throughout the twelfth century, mostly attributed to the fact that Crusaders returned bringing with them gifts such as silk and spices, which were worth more than what the Byzantine market had offered for them.
There was a time when the transition of the title of fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.
Gothic style was at its peak during the period between the 10th - 11th century and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the stable communication channels, styles in the West can be lagging by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture conducted for the production of just enough food to meet the needs of the agriculturist and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system using seeds native to the eco-region along with crop rotation or other very simple methods to achieve the most crops.
Historically speaking, most farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case today in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together similar people who feel abandoned by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of their own identity.
Subcultures can be somewhat different due to the generation, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that make a subculture distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, local, or a combination of these things.
Members of a subculture often signify their membership through a distinctive and emblematic use of fashion, which includes styles, etiquette, and slang.
One of the most well-known methods used to illustrate the importance of society is to draw from the several unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, did not have social interaction with adults while growing up.
Such children are referred to as "feral" or wild. Some feral children were confined by people (mostly their own parents); in some cases, the child's abandonment resulted from the parents' refusal to a child's severe intellectual or physical limitation.
Previous foster children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are suggested to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild world alone.
When entirely raised by non-human animals, the feral child will exhibit behaviors (with physical limitations) almost entirely like those certain care animals, such as his fear of or indifference to humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step too far.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but rather a support that provides assistance to individuals who are undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of a scaffold, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded within the software and are designed to prompt, assist with, and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student to undertake alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide range of reasons that include neglect, abuse, and even trafficking.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, does not show feeling, and does not provide education, but they do.
We view the foster care system as a protection zone for those children.
Our foster care system needs to provide secure homes, compassionate caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were removed.
The internet combines aspects of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The visible character of the internet leads to other sides of usage and satisfaction approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are proposed as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing connection" were also identified as new motifs by Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they examined viewer reaction to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few seconds.
In particular, it is reported that someone can detect if a person is lying by accurately assessing micro-expressions.
Eliezer Saks, in his paper on the President's speech, demonstrated how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess truthfulness.
He even suggested that such abilities in interpreting human behavior could be possessed by animals such as domestic dogs.
20th-century research has shown that there are two kinds of genetic changes: hidden and manifest.
Mutation adds new genetic differences, and selection removes them from the pool of expressed differences.
Segregation and recombination change back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
On the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to satisfy amino acid requirements from plant resources available there.
Moreover, failing to do so has serious consequences: increasing depression, malnutrition, and premature death.
The most accessible plant resources would be the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but these are harder for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, foods for animals (crickets, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide high amounts of proteins that contain all important amino acids.
Taking everything into account, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their protein problem in roughly the same way that chimps on the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a quieter alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm clock in the middle of sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other diuretics-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleep, which forces one to get up to go to the bathroom.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses corresponds inversely with the amount of tension within one's body and spirit.
The lower the anxiety, the more positive life force there is. Every person has the potential to find complete peace and tranquility.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha but has been extended through the Mahayana path of compassion and through many methods of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is quite simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of pure love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. Through the depiction of certain deities, the energy pathways are cleansed, the chakras activated, and the enlightenment consciousness formed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and USA. With the end of the war, the contrasts in system, process, and culture led to the countries falling out.
With two years from the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and would have been opposed exactly, by representative armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other locations.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize across the Roman bridgehead.
However, the plans were completely altered almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the northern regions of Poland, thereby violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is certainly the fastest way to move large numbers of people and goods across waters.
The traditional role of the navy has been to ensure your country maintains the ability to maneuver your people and things, while simultaneously interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and things.
One of the remarkable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans tried to help transport men and material across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mostly U-boats, tried to stop the traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer England as it did with the rest of Europe.
Goats were likely the first domesticated animals around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes started keeping them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in animal groups that wandered over mountains and other vegetated areas, often accompanied by goat herds. These goat herds were often children or young men, very similar to the more widely known shepherd. These herding methods are still in use today.
Railways were constructed in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagons made only of parallel wooden planks allowed horses pulling them to achieve greater speeds and pull heavier loads than on the somewhat heavier paths.
Crustaceans became known quite early for holding the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that it would be more effective if there was a strip of iron on top.
This has become a regular occurrence, but the iron has worn down the wooden wheels on the wagons even more.
Over time, wooden wheels took the place of iron wheels. In 1767, the first full-iron rails came out.
The first known transportation was walking, people started to walk two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as far back as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is exactly like a symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we want something that is not just a temporary solution, then we should find the underlying problems, and we should deactivate them.
It is quite clear that the world has changed significantly due to humanity's scientific and technological advancement, and problems have become greater due to overpopulation and mankind's excessive lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson and was then sent a few streets away to the print shop of John Dunlap.
Throughout the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, known today as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the garden of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which resulted in it being read to his soldiers in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many contemporary paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs has survived and lives today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds, but which ones still look like a dinosaur.
They have feet with claws and nails, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information which is coded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, like 0 or 1, and the numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal infections may not always become apparent immediately. Symptoms like rash are very common, and an immediate diagnosis may not be made.
The best sign of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open box of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Observe the sign for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal context for the group of insects.
The word comes from the former familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects easily adapted to parasitize humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, being adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their host.
Throughout the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the main neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Research has found that females are twice as likely to have MS as males.
A couple might decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the interest of their child, to raise a baby.
The parents can choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that the other couple can be parents to the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually leads most scientific research.
However, it is not enough on its own, experiments, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible assumed approaches, asking questions, and making observations also accompany scientific research work.
Naturalists and philosophers have looked at classical texts and, specifically, at the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's opinions on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
Since the knowledge of the Greek language has diminished, the Western world has found itself cut off from its Greek philosophers and scientific heritage.
Many accepted rhythms in physiology and behaviors are often critically dependent on whether there are endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Circadian rhythms, which are not simple responses to external temporal signals, have been documented for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to run several free-running cycles even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main propositions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to introduce their own DNA into a bacterium.
They made two attempts by labeling either the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with a radioactive sulfur.
Changes can also have several other effects depending on the type of change, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and if the cells affected are germ-line cells.
Only changes in germ line cells can be passed on to children, while changes in other places can cause cell damage or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural sites for the purpose of enjoying the landscapes, including plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about architectural designs in Baranya.
Every morning, people leave small country towns in cars to go to their workplace and pass by others whose workplace is where they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that the massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, one rarely hears similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Due to what do transportation systems contain such backlogs, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and cars between two points and the relationships they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic laws is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave in a logical, consistent manner; thus, traffic flows tend to have some logical consistency and can be more or less mathematically determined.
To better represent traffic flow, connections have been made between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
The relationships help with the planning, layout, and operation of the train facilities.
Insects were the first creatures to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them more easily invade enemies and find food and travel more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back to the length of their body.
This gives them a wider choice of small places to hide from persecutors.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
This seems understandable since the world doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water flowing from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although building pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
New Kingdom of Ancient Egypt marveled at their previous monuments, which were already dry over a thousand years old even then.
Vatican City's population is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the common language used by those who work in the state as opposed to Latin, which is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about main chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they can be discovered in nature in native form and are quite easy to excavate with simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, stated the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include a small number of non-metal elements such as carbon.
Every thing in the world is made of material, all materials are made of tiny pieces which are called atoms.
Atoms are so wonderfully small that trillions of them can fit into the period at the end of the sentence.
So, the pencil became a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods have emerged, lead has been relegated to a lower status and use.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, never having come close to a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something newer comes along.
The hydrogen bomb works on the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy wagon up a hill. Splitting the nucleus again releases a little more of the energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no provocation.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer part of the moon is called the crust.
The layer is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
There is dinner under the lake and fattening under the highlands.
There may be more seam on this side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on figuring out what upsets people and what they like.
The theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that were ingrained as they developed into adulthood.
The theories look at what is certain about some people that makes them want the things they do and which things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two tendencies can emerge when managers begin to lead their former peers. One end of this spectrum tries to remain "one of the guys" (or pals).
This type of supervisor has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, making evaluations, delegating responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything the group has already done and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This kind of leadership often results in splits between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual groups are held to the same standards as conventional groups, but there are small differences.
Virtual group members often function as the point of contact for their current physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional group members because their group can meet across different time zones, which may not be understandable by their local management.
The presence of a real "virtual team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each of the members.
Why would an organization want to go through the long process of establishing a learning organization? One goal for implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized across the active departments of an organization, wisdom may result.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new advanced process to serve the needs of the buyers.
Before an organization can be advanced, the leadership must cultivate a culture of advancement as well as communicate science and organizational learning.
Engel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of attainment.
Neurobiological information provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to studying perception, thereby narrowing the research area to make it much more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and bring changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models which help us understand the processes of our brain.
Although AI has a strong connotation with science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, which deals with performance, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent work.
Templates include control, planning, and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnostics and inquiries, as well as handwriting recognition, voice, and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines that emphasize providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the world of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as built into some home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of every classroom. Quite often a teacher will like to take her students to places where you can’t go by bus.
Technology provides the solution through virtual tours. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire magnificent artworks while sitting in their class.
Sharing a field trip report is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share the experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, each year the website is redesigned from scratch, but old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Although students often start their blog experience with scattered grammar and writing, the presence of viewers usually changes that.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to strive to improve writing to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging forces students to become more informed about the world around them. The need to cater to the interests of the audience motivates students to be clever and engaging (Toutao 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to take their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs “can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet material, students can clarify their position in comparison to others' descriptions as well as express their own views on certain issues (Arovec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's beautiful, bilingual capital and has a range of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Deeper in the south are the Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of the Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as what is considered officially Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a comparison of populations that astonishes many people: there are more African Americans living in the US than there are Canadians.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean, near the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by all accounts the largest, and it is a unique world of its own when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are either independent nations or connected to France and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the countries, and it was well received in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all women travelers say they are married, regardless of their marital status.
It is helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should note that cultural differences can result in actions they might consider as harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and do not be afraid to stand strong (cultural differences or not, it does not make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but later had to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Baida and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trade bases there.
Casablanca is one of the most interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, lime-shaped items, leather goods, hookahs, and a large selection of souvenirs, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets in the city, especially in the city center.
Although Gamma is quite secure, every visit outside of Gamma should be investigated to understand the situation of the hostilities occurring in the northern Kiva province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano together with one of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The local price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Together with its relative remoteness, "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor for exotic, distant places.
Today Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although the good reputation it has makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airfield.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the huge delays during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city is in sharp contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has a stronger Arab look than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeast of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 other ecozones, each of which supports different forest animals.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa, and is considered to be the flagship of South African National Parks (SANparks).
Like all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It can also be useful for someone to buy a wildcard, which provides access to any selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place where many tourists declare to be their main focus.
The arrangement of buildings that create the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a shining stick chart that becomes more prominent with the view of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head out to the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development is heavily concentrated on reclaimed land near the northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonists took for themselves; if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest littoral mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland from the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps – they include some of the last remaining parts of the mighty jungles that once covered the entire plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one-third is covered in water/marsh areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave from the sub-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but mostly, especially those going to the east and to Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the inter-district buses are often full, it is advised to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and strong.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, like Faro (Nu 150) and Funko (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oyapock in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long, and it has two lines of 3.50 meters in width.
The maximum height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction ended in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs inspection points are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most notable indigenous group that lived in what is today eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in agriculture.
The Choco region was inhabited by other groups of primitive tribes such as the Gweisure and Paiagua, which existed by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously called "La Provincia Gigantesca de los Indios," emerged as a result of a clash between Spanish forces and the local native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonization era which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its old-established character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Los Canitas.
Small contests and wrestling can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, search Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official Falkland Islands currency is the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value is estimated to be the same as one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West supermarket.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley, credit cards and United States dollars are also often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards will likely not be accepted, although British and American currencies can be accepted; consult with the property owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, therefore change money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures above +30º Celsius are normal.
The winter can be unusually cold: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but the wind and dampness together make it feel colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no distinct "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how gentle they look, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all big animals can attack.
Every year, many visitors get injured because they do not keep a proper distance. The animals are big, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, they are aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is on an island of Upolu and has a population of slightly less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port is the site of the tragically famous naval battle in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the war for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the town ended with the killing of the high chief Tafa’ifa Fa’amasino Laupepa III.
There are many beaches because of Auckland's straddling of two harbors. The most popular ones are in the three areas.
The north shores (in the North Harbor area) are on the Pacific Ocean, extending from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with secure swimming, and most have shade provided by palm trees.
Tamaki Drive cliffs are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upper sections of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
Often they are bustling family beaches with a good stretch of shops lining the shore. It is certainly safe to swim.
The main local beer is "Number One"; it's not a complicated beer, but a tasty and refreshing one. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines available, but the New Zealand and Australian wines might travel better.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but it is easy to find bottled water if you are afraid.
For an Australian, the concept of "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black is "espresso", cappuccino comes up to the top with cream (no foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate follows Belgian standards. Fruit soaps are expensive but very good.
Many trips to the peak are made all year round, and injuries due to one of the factors are rare.
Always take instructions from authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near shores and near river waterways from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes be found outside of these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively inhabit the ocean; their main habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Pre-booking gives travelers the peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep once they reach their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with certain hotels, though you might be able to reserve other sorts of accommodations, such as campgrounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, and sometimes combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the proposal or to provide other documents for your purpose (e.g., visa).
Any changes or requests should go through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For certain festivals, the majority of participants in music festivals decide to sleep on-site, and most participants consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will need to go in early enough to get a camping site near the music.
Remember that although even music on the main platforms has ended, there may be parts of the performance that will continuously play music until late into the night.
A few festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic in the winter, check the cabin location, since passing through ice creates a terrible noise for those who are most affected by it.
St. Petersburg circles include time in the shtetl. Circle passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually strive hard to get the most out of the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be hard to find.
They usually have special food, drinks, and arranged entertainment to keep guests in good spirits, and they keep them in the place.
Some places offer drinks on the house, but being drunk damages composure, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who will travel to high latitudes or over mountains should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, traction is weak and you cannot drive as you would on just asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall to get you stuck in very little time.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by rain or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the greatest tourism attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The title "Safari" in popular usage refers to overland journeys to view the magnificent African wildlife, primarily on the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to cars and standard equipment will allow a good view.
The lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "walking safari," or "walking tour") involves walking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as the 1964 games were held there.
If you booked your flight and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement was announced, then you possibly have a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies are varied, but since the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies were not extended to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes helps them dry. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board ready for use on demand, even if no one is present in the room.
If it's not possible to have a hot iron, or you don't want to wear ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to allow the material to become too hot (as this can cause it to shrink, or in extreme cases, to burn).
There are other ways of purifying water, some are more effective against certain threats.
In certain places, boiling water for one minute is enough, while in others, a few minutes are necessary.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have a concern, you should then consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reliable company.
Travelers can encounter animals they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Parties can spoil food, cause irritation, or in worse cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Contagious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people by force, do not qualify as pets.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from tax at specific locations.
Travelers who go to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated underground terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep your wits about you: sudden grades, narrow lanes, sharp turns dominate there.
Maximum speeds are considerably lower than in the previous and following sections – averaging 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is even more important than not.
Interesting though, mobile phone service is much stronger here than in any other route, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of their neighbors to the south, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with baked apples in pastry year-round, and cherries and plums appearing throughout the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Well-known pastries often go very well with a glass of strong coffee.
If you want to try small but rich pastries, try what are called in the region Berliner, pancakes, doughnuts.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
A bandage can be applied either dry or wet depending on the amount of fluid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and in other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a general term covering a vast array of regional dishes found throughout the nation.
However, when used without further qualifiers, the term usually refers to the food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese food has a range of simply spiced dishes, the strongest flavors being peanuts, chilies, sugar (particularly Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but may have safety problems due to the possibility of a rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but remains with a foot caught in the stirrup, then they can be dragged if the horse runs away. To reduce the risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First of all, most passengers wear travel boots with a heel and a smooth, very narrow sole.
Afterwards, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup leather to fall off the saddle if it is dragged backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley – Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a selection of granite large walls and cracks.
Gazers calculate breathtaking views from peaks of mountains. Climbers from all parts of the world continue to forge new paths among the endless possibilities of walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include ice skating and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve gliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major traveling activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as ski bums, who plan entire vacations around skiing at a specific location.
Skiing is very old – cave paintings show skiers as far back as 5000 BC!
Downhill ice skiing is a sport that dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking by ski: this activity is also called backcountry ski, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is connected but typically does not include alpine style ski tours or mountain climbing, the latter carried out in extreme territories and requiring much harder skis and boots.
Think of a hiking trail as a similar walking path.
Under good circumstances, you will be able to cover somewhat larger and wider distances than when walking on foot – but only in rare cases will you achieve the speed rate of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but has many independent countries. Traveling through many countries under normal circumstances would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control several times.
The Schengen Area, however, works somewhat like one country in this regard.
As long as you stay in the zone, you can usually cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, with holding a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas to each of the Schengen member countries separately, thereby saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no accepted opinion on which manufactured items are considered antique. Some tax agencies refer to goods older than one hundred years as antique.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limitations can be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted products can be defined as antique, even though they are younger than similar machine-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is significant also for many other industries.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sami were involved in the large-scale reindeer husbandry, but lived from fishing, hunting, and the like, having reindeer mostly as draft animals.
Today, Sami are working in modern professions. Tourism is an important income in Sapmi, the Sami region.
Although it is widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word "Gypsy" is often considered derogatory due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate portrayals of Roma people.
If the country you want to visit becomes the subject of a travel advisory, your health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You might also want to inquire about the proposals of governments different from yours, but their proposal is designed for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may have to deal with different circumstances than Europeans or Arabs.
Advisories are simply a brief overview of the political situation in one country.
The perspectives presented are often brief, superficial, and simple compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather event with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruptions, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of it that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive snow, and wildfires are phenomena and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be clear about all risks of severe weather that will affect their area as it may possibly impact their travel plans.
Someone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
A search on the internet for 'hostile environment course' will likely provide the address of a local company.
A course will typically cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will typically last 2-5 days and will include role-play, a lot of first aid, and some weapons training.
Books and magazines that deal with existing in the wild are known, but publications that deal with war zones are rare.
Travelers planning sex reassignment surgery must ensure they carry valid documents for the way back.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without listing the gender (X) or documents altered to match a desired name and gender changes.
Willingness of foreign governments to recognize the documents is equally problematic.
Searches at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Pre-operative transgender individuals should not have to endure scanners without their privacy and dignity being respected.
Rip currents are the returning surge of waves that break on the seashore/beach, often near piers or similar structures.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated on a few deeper parts, and a fast wave to deep water might possibly form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion while trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you come out of the rapids, swimming back is not harder than usual.
Try aiming somewhere you're not caught again, relying on your experience, and if you've been noticed, you might want to wait for a rescue.
Reverse culture shock comes faster than culture shock (there is less of a honeymoon phase), it lasts longer, and it can be more serious.
Travelers who had found it difficult to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it hard to readapt to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you are already accustomed to the new culture and have lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first arrived abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to acclimate.
People might not expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the performance begins.
Usually, you always hear the noise of tourists and vendors. The story of noise and laughter is just like in a storybook.
The sphinx is set as the foundation and the foreteller of a long story.
The scenes are set on the pyramids and the other pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a marvelous natural harbor.
All the land is the area south of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here converge in the plateau, then they emerge again to form the 360 km chain of the Elswart Mountains, intersected by the Minnesota Glaciers.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4,892 meters with Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, without cellphone coverage, a satellite phone is your only option.
A satellite phone usually doesn't take the place of a mobile phone because you need to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used for shipping, including leisure activities and expeditions that require extensive data and voice communication.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information about subscribing to the service.
A very popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel around and learn.
This is especially known for school leavers, it allows them to take one year off before university, taking a break from their education.
In many cases, this can be accomplished through a mid-year course abroad, improving the chances of entering higher education back in your homeland.
Usually, there will be a tuition cost to enroll in the learning programs.
Finland is a strong ships destination. The "land of a thousand lakes" has thousands of islands as well, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and rivers, you don't necessarily have to have a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller ships or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Traveling by ship is a national pastime in Finland, with one ship for every seven or eight people.
This is the same as in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but apart from this, quite unique (e.g., in the Netherlands, it is number one out of forty).
Most of the remarkable Baltic cruises feature an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a few eventful days and return to sleep on a ship at night.
If you travel to the country only with a cruise, you will not need a separate visa (valid from 2009).
Several cruises feature Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see from the map, Berlin is not at all near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have had other traumas.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and dislikes of other things that many people have.
To some extent, understanding how an aircraft works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on not being in control.
Companies that specialize in sending packages are well paid for sending things quickly. Often, time is very important with business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for an important repair.
On some of the routes, the larger companies have their own airplanes, but for other routes and smaller companies, there was a problem.
If they were to send things by air freight, certain routes would definitely take days to land and go through customs.
The only way for it to go through faster is to send it as checked baggage. Airport regulations won't allow them to send it as baggage without a passenger, and this is where you come in.
The sensible way to fly in first or business class is to spend a hefty sum of money for the privilege (or even better, have your company do it for you).
However, it doesn't come cheap; as the saying goes, you can expect to pay more than four times the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times more for first class.
Generally speaking, there is no point in even looking for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain main group of travelers who are ready to pay the highest price for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital city of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic warfare.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of a self-proclaimed Transnistrian republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Economic relations have been renewed between the two parts of Moldova despite its failure in political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christian.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation center.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed, and busy commercial center, built around a vast sea and surrounded by mountains.
The wide highways, glass buildings, and modern shopping centers go hand in hand with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market square, and old mosques and churches, giving the city an atmosphere more akin to Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvik offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an interesting octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves over various graves.
It's worth spending half an hour wandering around the fascinating village.
To the north side, easily accessible, is the romantic and interesting city of Sintra, which became known to strangers after a glowing account of its beauty was recorded by Lord Byron.
Bus route 403 regularly travels to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (shrine), a place of world-renowned Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are actually visiting a mass burial site, as well as a place with almost immeasurable significance to a large part of the world’s population.
There are many men and women who are still alive and lived through their time there, and many others who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death there, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this place with the utmost honor, seriousness, and respect that it deserves. Do not make any jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage the place by marking or scratching graffiti into the structures.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are marked only in Catalan because it is established by law to be the first and official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are announced by an automatic system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known to be egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is to be on your best behavior, behaving as someone who is "bien élevé" (properly raised). It will greatly facilitate getting around.
Parisian sharpness outside will quickly proceed if you manage to demonstrate a few main delicacies.
The Plitvice National Park is densely forested, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and has a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has an especially wide selection of plant communities due to its range of microclimates, various types of soil, and many levels of elevation.
The area is also home to a wide variety of animals and bird species.
Rare wild creatures such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat, and capercaillie can be found there, along with many more familiar types of creatures.
When visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and also have the shoulders covered.
Most of the monasteries provide robes for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
At the same time, men are required to wear pants that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the many things at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable wearing the jackets. One size fits all for the men!
Mallorcan cuisine (this Majorca cooking), like similar regions in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil everywhere.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in the summer, is the panzanella: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available toppings such as cheese, tuna fish, etc.
All nouns, along with the word "you" for you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to be able to differentiate between a few verbs and objects.
It also seemingly makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat more complicated because of the need to determine when and if a verb or adjective is used in a grounded manner.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in the Italian language because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to look at are C and G, because their sound depends on the following vowel.
Also, be sure to pronounce R and RR differently: kara means dear, whereas karra means carriage.
Persian has a moderately easy and mostly smooth grammar.
Therefore, reading this layout booklet will help you learn a lot about Persian script and understand phrases better.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish will often too quickly conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it doesn't need to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are typically not found today, and remain as museums or places of education.
Since light pollution in their heyday was not as much of a problem as it is today, they were usually found in cities or near campuses, easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes for research are huge installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Observing where cherry blossoms bloom, also known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the chosen flowers.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebrations were held by the emperor exclusively for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the royal court.
Plantings look their best when in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even a single specimen.
If you visit a formally arranged garden, then collecting "specimens" will also expose you to being thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to be and easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything upon arrival.
However, being located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with both heat (always) and intense sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also a few buses heading north to Hebron, to the traditional burial site of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you are thinking of taking goes into Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis around which to base a holiday.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or take a cruise to interesting places on the Danube or sail along the Erie Canal.
They also take note of well-known walking and biking routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have been adopted by non-believers in both Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition to spend the Easter night being awake at an open spot to see the sunrise.
There are certainly Christian theological explanations for the tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night throughout the Easter weekend, with the congregations often breaking into celebration soon at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals cannot make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans to the Galápagos, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in the winter, you will experience polar nights, which means the sun will not shine over the horizon.
This gives a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, since the sky will be dark more or less around the clock.
Since the areas have a small population, and light pollution is therefore not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what people from the West may be accustomed to.
Blazers are common business attire, and coworkers address each other by last names or job titles.
Workplace collaboration is critical, emphasizing teamwork rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often need to receive their superior's approval for every decision they make, and are expected to follow their superior's instructions without question.
