This confirms an already widely discussed theory that only certain dinosaurs had feathers. Furthermore, it provides details on color and three-dimensional structure that cannot generally be provided by fossilized skin remains.
Scientists say that the upper surface of this animal's feathers is chestnut-brown in color while the underside is either pale or carotenoid in color.
The discovery provides insights into the evolutionary development of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have shafts developed, they are referred to as rachis, but they possess other features of feathers - barbs and barbules - researchers inferred rachis and considered that these other features might be of later evolutionary development.
The structure of the feathers was not used for flying, but instead is said to control temperature or for display. Although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows a mature feather, not that of a juvenile, researchers suggest.
Though this is a small dinosaur's tail, the results of the specimen indicate that it has mature scars, and researchers suggest that it is not from the back of a chick.

In her other race, the giant slalom, she secured the tenth position in the women's race in 4:41.30 minutes, which is 2:11.60 minutes less than the Austrian winner Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes less than the ninth-placed Jeongyi Dani.
In the current women's group, four skiers failed to complete their run, and a total of 45 out of 117 skiers failed to finish the race in the giant slalom.
In Madhya Pradesh, the police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Superintendent of Police D.K. Arya said, "We have arrested five individuals who sexually assaulted a Swiss woman and seized laptops and mobile phones from them."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bootha Kanjar, Rambro Kanjar, Kasa Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar respectively.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki appeared in court with the accused with their faces covered.
When the car collided, although there were three people inside the house, no one was injured.
However, the driver survived with severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed. Meanwhile, emergency services rescued the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adigoya has been in the custody of the Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then for the crime of murdering her son.
His accusation and investigation are pending, but any eyewitness accounts could be tainted due to the widespread release of his picture.
This is a common practice in England, but with Scottish justice operating differently, the courts consider releasing photographs to be potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University stated, "By publishing the photographs of the suspects, journalists are treading on a dangerous path."
The higher office that manages the overall responsibility of the cases pointed out to the journalists that no further comments will be made until at least the charges are brought.
According to the secret information revealed, the document is about the border dispute concerning Palestine's claim over the borders that existed during the Middle East war of 1967.
The mentioned other topics pertain to the future status of holy Jerusalem concerning both countries and the Jordan Valley issue.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel requires a military presence in the valley for ten years, but the PA agrees to only a five-year military presence.
As the trial is monitored and its performance evaluated, the guards must closely monitor the shooters in the auxiliary pest control trial.
Qualified volunteers were recruited under the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association, in collaboration with NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association Australia (NSW) Inc.
According to NPWS's Deputy Director of Park Conservation and Heritage Mick O'Flynn, full safety and training details have been provided to the four selected marksmen.
Yesterday, Martelly was inaugurated into the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) consisting of nine members.
This is Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
The presidential panel last month suggested that the previous CEO's resignation was part of an effort to move the country towards a new election.
This commission is Martelly’s response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
Some instances of violent protests were sparked due to the failure to conduct elections since the year 2011.
There have been 60 complaints registered for iPods overheating and ceasing to function, which have caused a total of six fire incidents and resulted in minor burns for four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has stated that it is aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
"Last week, METI stated that Apple reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as 'not serious.'"
The ministry responded to this, stating it is "truly regrettable" that Apple is delaying the report.
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 a.m. GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office has stated that no damage has occurred in the country.
Furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has stated that there are no signs of a tsunami.
A former police officer from the Philippines has hijacked a bus with Hong Kong tourists and held them as hostages in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza used his M16 rifle to shoot the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued, and it has been confirmed that at least 6 people have died so far.
Like the Filipino photographers, six hostages, children, and the elderly were released first.
The photographers occupied the place of the elderly woman in need of a restroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical field.
Trained as an obstetrician, she began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature birth during his leisure time.
His research suggests that managing one's hormones will accelerate the maturity of a child's fetal lungs.
Jinhewa has reported that government officials have recovered two 'black boxes' from the plane.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first politician of the extremists. Luna passed away on a night with two moons. Uniquely like her. A determined woman."
"Luna is as naughty as I am... maybe even more... I love her, I grieve for her loss... I hope she is in a better place than this," expressed Dustin "Goldust" Runnels.
Before the 2010 federal election, among the 1,400 people who voted, those opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Labor Prime Minister Julia Gillard expressed her belief that Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent have voted that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
At the height of the opinion poll, 29 percent of people believe that Australia should soon become a republic, while at the same time, 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic swimming gold medalist was scheduled to participate in the Commonwealth Games in the 100m, 200m, and three relays. However, due to his physical fitness issues, his participation has become questionable.
He cannot take the medication necessary to relieve his pain because they are banned in sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of mathematical sciences at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25.
At the beginning of February, many verified the discovery using various hardware and software, and it was announced on Monday.
Comets could have been a source of water for Earth, and along with organic materials, they could create proteins to support life.
Scientists believe that by studying information about comets that collided with Earth a long time ago, it is possible to understand how planets form, specifically how Earth was formed.
53-year-old Cuomo took office as governor earlier this year and legalized the same-sex marriage bill last month.
He described these rumors as "meaningless political talk and foolishness."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
The FAA states that NextGen will enable airplanes to fly shorter routes, helping to save millions of gallons of fuel annually and control carbon emissions.
This uses satellite-based technology against old ground-radar-based technology for air traffic controllers to point out airplanes with greater accuracy and provide even more precise information to pilots.
No additional transport has been arranged, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available at the stadium.
The fear of inadequate transport facilities could potentially force the team to play behind closed doors without supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reveals the formation of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species have evolved within two generations, although this process was believed to take a longer time, due to interbreeding between the medium ground finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into any form. It can also be turned into small balls.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, twisted, and braided. It can be hammered into sheets or rolled.
"It can be made very thin and layered onto another metal. Sometimes, it can be made thin enough to be used in hand-painted illustration books, which are called 'illuminated manuscripts.'"
This is called chemical pH. You can create an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or alkaline it is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed. (This is because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then knead it into a ball with clean, moist hands.
The moisture on your hands interacts with the outer skin layers, giving a peculiar sensation and forming a kind of protective layer.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to an advanced sewage drainage system.
In Greece, traces of sewage systems have been discovered in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China had toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths used together by both men and women.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call from Earth. Then, it promptly reflects back as if it answered the call.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and visibility.
A large rocket, 100 feet high, is required to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has transformed the world in unbelievable ways. The greatest thing the wheel has provided us is the ability for much easier and faster transportation.
This has brought us trains, cars, and many other modes of transportation.
Under them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, such as rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including house cats) eat various types of small insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the idea of individuality; each cat has a unique job that keeps it from competing with the others.
Lions, which are social cats, live in large groups called prides.
A pride of lions consists of one to three large male lions, along with thirty female lions and cubs.
Within a large family, sisters and daughters are generally closely connected to each other as women.
Like lions, animals such as wolves or dogs operate remarkably and even align in their actions, potentially making them very dangerous (unlike other cat species).
A skilled athletic tiger can leap, swim, cover great distances, and pull an object with five times the strength of a human.
The tiger also belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the loud roar of a lion, but like a roaring phrase with words that speak sharply.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals. They will attempt to catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if possible. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and eat underground animals by scent and sniffing.
Owls have excellent vision at night and the ability to move stealthily; they blend with their surroundings, pouncing to hunt their prey.
When a small group of people (a small population) separates from a large population (if they cross a mountain or a river or move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and competitors, so to be stronger competitors than what was needed before this new crowd, different aspects or variations will be required.
The true population will never change, just like in the past, they need embraces today.
Over time, new populations adapt to the new diverse environment, and therefore, they appear different from others.
In the end, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We refer to this process as speciation, which is the creation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make homes, clothes, and other things from plants. Most of the foods we eat are plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the dominant predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
The long jaws contain more than 70 knife-like sharp teeth with an additional set of teeth on the upper part of its mouth, meaning anyone crossing its path cannot escape from it.
We are not sure for certain, its teeth might have been very sharp. Its diet includes turtles, large fish, and mosasaurs, and it could have also been a carnivore.
It attacked anything that entered the water; even a large dinosaur like the T. rex couldn't match its size.
Most of the Romans' foods are familiar to us, yet the Romans included exotic or unusual banquet items. They served wild boar, peacocks, snails, and dormice, known as edible rodents, as feasts.
Another significant difference is that poor people will sit on chairs and eat with their women, whereas the rich would prefer to eat while lounging beside the meal together.
Foods of the ancient Romans could not have included items that came from Asia or America many centuries later.
For example, they did not eat corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa. And no ancient Roman could have ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple, considering it the home for all their gods.
People bring offerings for God. Scholars attempt to fulfill God's needs through festivals and celebrations.
In every temple, there will be an outer open temple hall and an inner sanctum where only priests are allowed.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped ziggurats, termed as towers, were constructed as parts of temples.
At the top of the tower, there was a special shrine for the deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house is not considered very important.
A large part of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops opened out onto the street and were openly visible. Stone was used to build the house.
In the land of Canaan, as there were no large forests, wood was very expensive.
There was very little settlement in Greenland. According to Norrse tales, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder. They say that as he journeyed further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
Even without his discovery, the Eskimo indigenous people were already living there.
Even if all the countries were 'Scandinavian', there were many differences in the people, rulers, customs, and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that there is a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that is not true. Even if something is written on the back of that document, it is not a treasure map.
What is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence is, "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." This text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
In a situation where no one knew who wrote it, during the early part of its life, that great parchment document (measuring 29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
Therefore, this notation may have been added merely as a label.
D-Day landings and the subsequent battles liberated the northern part of France, but the east was still not liberated.
"It was the ‘Vichy’ that was ruled by the French. It was these French people who made a peace agreement with the Germans in the 1940s and collaborated with those crossing the borders instead of fighting them."
On the 15th of August, 1940, after the Allied forces infiltrated southern France, the invasion was called 'Operation Dragon'.
In just two weeks, the American and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
A significant large group of people working together in unity and living together forms a single culture known as civilization.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin words civilis meaning civil, civis meaning citizen, and civitas meaning country or province of a country, and somehow it defines the scale of society.
City-states are the forerunners of countries. A civilized culture denotes the sharing of knowledge over many generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and equitable dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving related historical evidence, and they are overlooked and not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the revolutionary war, thirteen states, with only Congress, established a weak central government under the framework of confederation.
The Congress party does not have the authority to levy taxes. Due to the lack of a national administration or judiciary, it often relied on government officials who were mostly uncooperative to implement all its laws.
It does not even have the authority to regulate the tax and customs duties between the states.
The state government did not take the central government very seriously because before these rules were amended, it required the unanimous consent of all states, and often their representatives were not there.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is considered the second most successful team in the world and were also the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, handball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
The winter sports competitions are very popular in the northern regions, and along with this, Italians compete in international games and the Olympics.
The 7,000 islands in Japan (of which the largest is Honshu) make Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Due to the cluster of islands in Japan, from a geographical perspective, Japan is called an archipelago.
Taiwan began in the 15th century, where European sailors recorded the island, which they passed, as Ilha Formosa or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, initiating a change in indigenous grain production methods and employing Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces seized control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, whereby it cedes full sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governs it until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings at the corners of the complex have been restored to give tourists a good idea of how they originally looked.
Until 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and those restoration efforts continue to this day.
For example, the most commonly used standard format for still images in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film format during the analogy film era.
This is still being produced, but most importantly its aspect ratio was achieved by digital camera image sensor formats.
In reality, the 35 mm format is slightly confusing at 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this design (dividing by twelve to get a simple whole number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common systems (such as ABS types of systems) are equal to or close to this natural frequency.
As one third, the often mocked rule is a simple guideline for creating energy when maintaining a level of order in a photograph.
The important lesson says that a skilled place is located at the intersection of lines that divide a shape vertically and horizontally into thirds. (See example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was subjected to scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has united the European countries beyond their linguistic and cultural differences.
The power that pervaded all of it affected everyone from the king to the common people.
Wealth should be used to remove sufferings and poverty is one of the Christian doctrines, and the financial wealth of the churches is primarily there for this reason.
The central authority of the churches has been emanating from Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth in one place leads many to question whether fundamental doctrines are being fulfilled.
Once these protests erupted, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
Although this siege violated the generally accepted international law stipulated in several international treaties over the past two centuries, this strategy proved effective in disrupting critical military and civilian supplies.
The mines laid by Britain in international waters to prevent any ship from entering certain parts of the sea posed a danger to neutral ships as well.
As this tactic had limited success, Germany expected a similar outcome for unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the widespread mindset of most citizens and nations was inclined towards peace and isolation.
During the First World War, the countries that witnessed the horrors and atrocities of the war wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to America with 4 cents in his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous job) to be given to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China followed a unique system at different periods; each dynasty or family in power in China was a distinct lineage.
The provinces were divided between each dynasty, resulting in a state of instability. The Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties, were particularly known for this period.
In this period, a fierce battle took place among many nobles to seize the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was a blood-soaked period in ancient Chinese history, where thousands of people died fighting to sit in high positions in the great palace of Xian.
The use of the metric system, the transition from autocracy to republic, nationalism, and the belief that the country does not belong to any single person but to the people, have many social and political implications.
After the revolution, all jobs were open to all male applicants, allowing those who were enthusiastic and successful to advance.
Instead of being based on the army's rank, this is based on ability, so it applies to the military as well.
The French Revolution inspired revolutions among the oppressed working classes in other countries.
Muhammad was deeply involved in matters beyond worldly life. He often went to the cave in the Mount "Nur" (Light), which was later called "Hira," for meditation.
He portrayed a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual desires in the timeless cave.
The cave situated at the peak of a mountain to the north of Mecca was completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Indeed, even if one knows it exists, finding it is not easy. Once inside the cave, it will be complete isolation.
Except for the clear, beautiful sky above and being surrounded by many mountains, nothing else can be seen. From inside the cave, very little of the world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders of the ancient world that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, is one of the many large pyramid structures constructed to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian valley contains many pyramids (with the Great Pyramid being the largest), several smaller tombs, many temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upper bow" mark looked like a V and the "lower bow mark" looked like a staple pin or a square missing a bottom part.
If it says up, you should press the bow from the tip, and if it says down, you should pull the bow starting from the frog (where your hand holds the bow).
A lower bow is powerful and emphatic, while an upper bow usually produces a softer sound.
Feel free to write your own feedback scores, but remember that they are there for a reason to be respected because of music, so they should generally be appreciated.
Frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were driven from Versailles to Paris by a mob of market women on October 6, 1789.
As they were returning to Paris in the carriage, a group surrounded their carriage, shouting threats and curses at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
At one point, someone in the crowd showed the head of the royal guard killed at Versailles to the frightened queen.
The Filipino people themselves paid for the war expenses of the American empire that took over the Philippines.
They were compelled to allocate a significant portion of the expenses for the interest on the bonds in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks and to pay taxes to the American colonial administration.
Certainly, the fundamental interests of U.S. imperialism may be broadly seen as the massive profits derived from exploiting the people of the Philippines in various ways.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the circumstances that prompted the creation of the organization.
The period when events occurred is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, a time in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
Before the High Middle Ages was the Early Middle Ages and afterwards the Late Middle Ages, all of which, according to tradition, ended around 1500.
The term "technological determinism" encompasses a variety of ideas in practice, ranging from a strong sense that human destiny is driven by an intrinsic motivation or necessity for technology, to a foundational argument associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Explanations about the norms of technology express two concepts: the development of technology follows a path that transcends cultural or political influence, and the "effects" caused by technology in society are more natural than caused by social impact.
For example, one might say that the development of motor cars is essential for the progress of roads.
However, nationwide road connectivity is not economically feasible for just a few cars, so new manufacturing methods are being developed in an effort to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The general public having cars on the road leads to many accidents, which facilitates the discovery of new techniques to heal injured bodies in the healthcare sector.
The greatest element for cultural affirmation received from writers like Goethe, Schiller, and Fichte was in Romanticism.
Regarding romanticism, geography shaped individuals, over time those geographically related customs and cultures emerged, and these being in harmony with society was better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Paris, regarded as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was renowned as a center of luxury approximately from 400 A.D. to 1100 A.D.
In the twelfth century its status began to decline, primarily because the Crusaders returned with silk and spices more valuable than those supplied by the Byzantine markets.
It was at that time that the title of the capital of civilization was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style was prevalent during the period between the 10th and 11th centuries to the 14th century.
In the beginning, the attire was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
It was only at the end of the Middle Ages that Western Europe began to cultivate its style. One of the major developments of that period was the use of buttons by people to fasten their clothing as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence farming is about producing only the amount of food needed for the farmer and his family in agriculture.
Subsistence farming is simple, often organic, employs saved seeds, is local to the environment, and can maximize yields by integrating crop rotation or other simple practices.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in farming as a livelihood, and this is still the practice in many developing countries.
Subcultures help individuals with similar thoughts, who feel marginalized by societal standards, to unite and develop an identity of their own.
Subcultures may be unique due to the age, race, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that define a sub-culture are distinguished by language, origin, religion, politics, gender, geography, or a mixture of many statements.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through the distinctive and emblematic use of their civilization, behavior, and words.
One of the best ways to emphasize the importance of socialization is to rescue those children who are subjected to misfortune and disrespect by either children or adults, and those who are not accustomed to the public sphere.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been abandoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, a child's severe intellectual or physical disability leads to abandonment by the parents.
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
It is said that some were raised by animals; it is said that some might have lived in the forest on their own.
When entirely raised by non-human animals, the feral child completely adopts the behavior of the nurturing animal towards humans, either being afraid or indifferent, to the extent that physical condition permits.
Process education simplifies learning and makes it more interesting. Scaffolding takes it another step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather it provides support to individuals who are gaining a new learning experience or starting a new project using a new computer.
Scaffolds can be both real and virtual, that is, a teacher being a scaffold as well as the small paper clip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are built into the software, and the practices that may be challenging for students to manage independently should be questioned, prompted, and explained.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons such as neglect, verbal abuse, and extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an uncaring, inconsiderate, and uneducated environment, but they do.
We believe that the foster care system will be a safe place for these children.
Our foster care system is committed to providing a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare services.
Raising a child is expected to provide all the needs that were lacking in the previous home.
The internet integrates elements for communication among people and connecting individuals.
Certain notable characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions of accessibility related to benefits and satisfaction.
For example, learning and socializing are key drivers of internet use (James et al., 1995).
When Imai and Mikkord analyzed the reactions of visitors to websites, "individual engagement" and "continuous relationships" were both identified as new motivational factors by them.
The use of video editing led to important discoveries such as subtle expressions of emotion and facial movements that could last only a few seconds.
Specifically, it is said that by accurately explaining the nuances of a person's micro-expressions, it can be determined whether they are lying or not.
Oliver Sacks has pointed out in "The President's Speech" study that the honesty of people who cannot comprehend speech due to brain damage can be accurately assessed.
He even suggests that such abilities reflecting human behaviors may be shared by animals like house dogs.
Research in the twentieth century suggests that there are two types of genetic variations: recessive and dominant.
Ruins introduce new genetic variations and selection removes them from the mentioned variation type.
The disparity between two generations alternates back and forth through separation and restructuring.
Outside the savanna grasslands, it is difficult for an animal with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure can result in severe consequences such as developmental stress, nutritional deficiencies, and ultimately death.
The easily available plant resources are the proteins found in leaves and legumes. However, for mammals like us, they are hard to digest unless cooked.
On the other hand, animal foods (ants, crickets, eggs) are easily digestible, but they contain high-quality proteins with all the essential amino acids needed.
After considering everything, it is not surprising to learn that our ancestors would have solved the protein problem, just as the chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption refers to waking up for any purpose during your normal sleeping hours and going back to sleep after a short period (10-60 minutes).
You can easily do this by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring just your alertness without fully waking you up.
If you are someone who stops your alarm while you are sleeping, force yourself to place it across the room so you have to get up to turn it off.
Among other habits based on biological rhythms, consuming a lot of fluids (particularly water, tea, well-known diuretics) before sleep is included, which drives us to wake up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is related to the level of tension in their body and spirit.
Every human has the ability to find complete peace and satisfaction with reduced mental stress, leading to a more positive life.
We can all attain the light of wisdom. The obstacles to this goal are our stress and negative thoughts.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded with many techniques from the Mahayana path of compassion and Indian yoga.
The philosophy of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and love that embraces everyone.
Through Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (divine light energy) is activated using yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is divine yoga. By depicting various deities, energy pathways are cleansed, chakras are activated, and a sense of enlightenment is generated.
During World War II, since Germany was a common enemy, there was cooperation between the USA and the USSR. After the war ended, organizational, operational, and cultural differences caused the two countries to drift apart.
Two years after the war ended, former allies have now become enemies and the Cold War began.
In reality, with fictional armies, it continued for the next 40 years in battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, Poland's defense had already collapsed, and the hope was to reorganize the part of the Romanian Bridgehead.
However, plans went awry overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered. After occupying the eastern parts of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, it formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, not adhering to the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Transporting goods using ships is, so far, the best way to carry a large number of people and goods across the sea.
The traditional role of the navy is to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time impeding your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans tried to transport people and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy attempted to stop this traffic, primarily using U-boat types.

It is estimated that goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran approximately 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and indigenous peoples knew how to easily access milk, fur, meat, and leather.
The goats raised at home are reared in flocks and roam around the hills or graze in pastures, often guided by children or young people specifically referred to as shepherds, who are commonly known as goat herders. This type of flock-rearing method is still in practice today.
The Veganway was built in England in the early 16th century.
Even though the roadways consisted only of flat wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to move at extreme speeds and to pull more weight than slightly uneven roads.
In the early days, cross laws were introduced to hold onto the tracks. However, it was felt that if there were an iron bar gradually placed on top of them, those tracks would still be more powerful.
Although it had become a regular habit, it caused increased wear on the wooden wheels of the iron carts.
Over time, wooden wheels turned into iron wheels. In 1767, the first full iron track was introduced.
The earliest known form of transportation is walking, and humans began to walk with the emergence of Homo erectus (upright man) around two million years ago.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, were not accustomed to walking upright.
Although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs seven million years ago, bipedal specialization is seen in Australopithecus fossils only from 4.2-3.9 million years ago.
We can start living more harmoniously with the environment, join the environmental movement, and act as activists to some extent to reduce future impacts.
This is akin to symptomatic treatment in many instances. However, if we do not want just a temporary solution, we must identify the root of the problems and make them ineffective.
It is evident that the world has changed significantly due to the scientific and technological advancements of the human race, and problems have increased due to the larger population and the very luxurious lifestyle of people.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the printing press of John Dunlap, which was a few buildings away.
Throughout the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, which are now called "Dunlap Broadsides."

Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that can continue to operate in a cyclical manner even in the absence of external cues.
One of the key proposals that DNA is a genetic material is the Hershey and Chase experiment.
Harsha and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their DNA into bacteria.
The DNA in the bacterium was tagged with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the bacterium was tagged with radioactive sulfur, and they conducted two (2) experiments.
Sudden changes can cause various types of effects, which depend on the sudden change itself, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the changes have impacted the sequences of genetic material in the cells.
Only changes in germline cells can be passed on to children, while changes that occur in other locations may cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism greatly attracts people who enjoy visiting natural places to see sights including plants and wildlife.

In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based primarily on private cars and is provided with services.
The science now points out that this massive carbon economy has removed the biosphere from one of the stable states that supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you may occasionally hear about complaints of similar magnitude, such as water quality issues or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems become the cause of such complaints, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic congestion is the study of the movement and interaction of vehicles and individual drivers between two points.
Fortuitously, studying traffic flow is somewhat challenging because it is impossible to predict drivers' behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, the drivers exhibit a willingness to operate their vehicles within a reasonable and consistent limit; hence, the traffic maintains a reasonable stability, and they are mathematically represented.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established among three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operations of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helps them easily escape from predators and efficiently locate food and mates.
Most insect species have the ability to fold their wings back against their bodies.
It provides a wide range of small shelters to escape from the ferocious animals.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
A thousand years ago, a person named Aristarchus stated that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought his claim was correct, and many others thought his claim was wrong; that is, the claim that the solar system, including the Sun, revolves around the Earth (and other stars too).
This seems logical, because you don't feel the Earth moving, do you?

People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper extracted in ancient times, as these were all discovered in their native forms in nature, and mining work carried out with primitive tools was simple.
The philosopher Aristotle said that everything is formed from a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These were like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he thought they transformed into new substances and created what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two (2) or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.

Why does the organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up an educational institution? The sole objective of implementing corporate learning ideas is to utilize innovation.
If all departments of a company make optimal use of all the available resources, creativity and intelligence will benefit everyone.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer's needs.
Before a company can innovate, its leadership must create a culture that implements innovations, and fosters knowledge sharing and organizational learning among colleagues.
Angel (2006) explains that using a continuous process will lead the company to achieve a large scale of efficiency improvements.
In cognitive research, a philosophical approach provides empirical evidence through neurological data. Therefore, it narrows down the research area and makes it highly precise.
The connection between neurology and behavior aids scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, shock, injuries, tumors, etc., affect actions and cause some changes in the state of mind.
The advent of new technologies allows us to observe and explore brain structures and processes that were previously unimaginable.
It provides a wealth of information and resources to build conceptual models that help understand the workings of our mind.
Although AI is closely related to his science fiction work, AI is a significant branch of computer science that deals with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent modification.
Research in AI involves creating machines that can perform complex tasks automatically.
Control, planning and organization, the ability to identify customer needs and respond to queries, including examples such as signature recognition, voice, and facial recognition.
Such matters have become separate fields, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI technology is now predominantly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, and it is also integrated into many home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a major part of all classrooms. A teacher would often want to take their students to places that a bus journey cannot reach.
Technology provides solutions through field trips that rival reality. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or appreciate beautiful art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing the journey to the fields in a visual manner serves as the best way to reflect the experience of the trip and to share it with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to their state capital, and the website is redesigned every year, but old versions are made available online for scraping.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing skills. Students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and typos, but the presence of viewers generally changes them.
Since students are very important readers, black writers make great efforts to write their works to avoid controversies.
"Furthermore, blogs encourage students to become curious about the world around them. The idea of feeding the curiosity of readers motivates them to be both intelligent and interesting (Totto, 2004)."
A blog is a tool that effectively extends and supports learning for students beyond the traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs "makes students more critical and analytical; it helps them not only to state their responses to online questions but also to take a stance of their own while responding to the opinions of others" (Oravec 2002).
