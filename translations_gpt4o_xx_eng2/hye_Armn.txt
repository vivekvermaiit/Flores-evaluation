This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the feathers of this animal were brown on the upper part and pale or yellowish on the lower part.
The discovery also provides insight into the development of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed feather tip, called a rachis, but possess other features of feathers such as barbs and barbules, researchers suggested that the rachis was most likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers propose that although this is a juvenile dinosaur tail, the specimen shows adult feathering, not that of a chick.
Researchers assume that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not a chick's.

They have discovered that the sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars; it has been found that the activity of all the stars in the system has been stimulated by their luminosity, through their rotation, and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversal.

The completed work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to promote observations made from the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would arise from the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon has a gravitational influence on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around the galaxy surrounds it in the form of a halo and consists of numerous small particles.

In France, voting is traditionally conducted with simple technology: voters seclude themselves in a voting booth, place a pre-printed ballot in an envelope, and indicate their chosen candidate.
When the official verifies the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The electoral law of France quite strictly codifies newsletters.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the voting and that no envelopes have been added except for those that have been properly counted and allowed to voters.
Candidates can send representatives to be present at each stage of the process personally. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

It is scheduled that Huhn and Price are to appear before the Westminster International Court on February 16th.
The victims of the accident were 25-year-old Nicholas Alden and 21-year-old Zachary Cuddeback. Cuddeback was the driver.
Edgar Vegillan received arm and jaw injuries, while Christopher Schneider was left in the hospital because he needed facial reconstructive surgery.
Ukha's gun didn't fire when he aimed at the fifth person's head. Schneider has persistent pain, one of his eyes is blind, a part of his skull is missing, and his face is reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via video link from a U.S. Air Force base in his homeland.
Apart from Wednesday's events, Karpenedon participated in two individual races in the championship.
His first competition was a ski race, where his first run was scored as "Did Not Finish." Out of 116 competitors, 36 had the same result in that race.
In her next giant slalom race in the women's seated group, she finished tenth with a combined run time of 4:41.30, which is 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Loesch who finished first and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Hungary's representative Gy√∂ngyi Dani who finished ninth.
In the group of seated women, four skiers failed in their race, and in the giant slalom competition, 45 out of 117 skiers could not secure a place in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police found and returned the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Aryan said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman, and we have returned her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police supervisor Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused had come to court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was transferred to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital located in Cambridge.
Since that time, Adekoian has been at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court on charges of murdering his son.
He was in detention awaiting an indictment and trial, but any witness testimony could have been compromised since his image had been widely publicized.
Overall, this is a widespread practice in the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice operates differently, and the courts view the publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists put themselves at risk by publishing photos and other materials of suspects."
The Royal Office, which is generally responsible for carrying out prosecutions, has informed journalists that no further comments will be made at least until the indictment is presented.
According to the leak, the document will pertain to the dispute concerning the borders; Palestine wants the borders to be based on those that existed before the 1967 Middle East war.
According to reports, other discussed topics include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after signing the agreement, while the Palestinian authorities agree to allow such a presence for only five years.
During the additional pest control testing, the shooters were under the direct supervision of the forest rangers, as monitoring of the test was conducted and its effectiveness was evaluated.
In partnership with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia, qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, who is the Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have undergone comprehensive safety and training courses.
Yesterday, Martelli was sworn in at the new Interim Electoral Council composed of nine members.
That is Marteli's fifth parcel via express mail in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission proposed the resignation of the former Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures leading the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the large-scale protests against the ruling power that began in October.
Sometimes the catalyst for fierce protests was the failure to conduct elections, some of which starting from 2011.
Approximately 60 cases have been reported related to iPods overheating, resulting in six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) said it had been aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple reported 34 more cases of overheating, which the company called "unserious."
The ministry had responded, calling the postponement of Apple's report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM Greenwich Mean Time on Friday).
The Office of Emergency Management of the Northern Mariana Islands reported that no damage has been recorded in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there is no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in the Philippines' capital, Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and it has been confirmed that at least six people have died so far.
Six captives, including children and adults, were released earlier, like the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an old woman when she needed the restroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
The Ligins followed in their father's footsteps and chose the profession of a doctor.
She had trained as a midwife and started working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While she was working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature births during her free time.
According to his research, the maturation of fetal embryonic lungs can be accelerated with the help of administering one hormone.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday investigators recovered the two 'black boxes' of the flight recording.
The fellow wrestler training partners also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. As unique as she was. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels mentioned that "Luna was as crazy as me... maybe even more... that he loves her and will miss her... hoping that she is in a better place."
Before the 2010 federal elections, among the 1,400 people surveyed, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Julia Gillard, who was temporarily fulfilling the duties of Prime Minister, asserted during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those surveyed share this view; they want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In the latest survey, 29% of respondents believed that Australia would become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believed that Australia would never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and compete in three medley events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness was called into question.
He had not been able to take the necessary medication to overcome his pain, because they are banned by the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery by the beginning of February using different hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets have probably been a source of water supply to the Earth along with organic materials that can form proteins and support survival.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, as comets collided with Earth many years ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his administration earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriages.
He presented the gossip as "political prattle and foolishness."
It is assumed that he will run for the presidency in 2016.
The "NextGen" system, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the United States, will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel every year and reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike the old ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to detect the aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transport vehicles will be introduced, and the overground trains will not stop at Wembley, while parking in the ground, vehicle parking, and facilities providing travel by other means of transport will be unavailable.
Concerns about the lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the game would have to be held behind closed doors, without the team's supporters.
The study published in the journal "Science" on Thursday reported the formation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within just two generations, although it is assumed that this process would have taken much longer due to the interbreeding between Darwin's endemic ground finch, the medium-sized ground finch, and the migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into any form. It can be rolled into small molds.
It can be drawn into thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be forged or wrapped in sheet form.
It can be made very thin and inserted into other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to embellish hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called chemical pH. You can use red cabbage juice as an indicator.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical composition is.
In the tested chemical composition, the pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (amount of H in pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons from which the electrons have been separated (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then with clean wet hands, press it to form a ball.
The moisture of your hands will react with the outer layers, which will be amusing and create a sort of shield.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro have almost every house equipped with a toilet that is connected to a complex sewer system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been discovered in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. During the Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women would be together in the same place.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
In space, the satellite receives the call and almost instantly responds to it.
The satellite has been sent into space by a rocket. In space, scientists use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
To place a satellite or telescope in space, a gigantic rocket 100 feet long is necessary.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done is to provide us with an easier and faster means of transportation.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
More of them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to deer and fawns.
And finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming house cats) that feed on a much larger number of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche idea; each cat has a special role that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three adult males with blood relations, which may be accompanied by more than thirty females and cubs.
Female representatives are usually more warmly connected to each other, being part of a large family of sisters and daughters.
Prides of lions more often appear as packs of wolves or dogs, the animals are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior and also very deadly for their prey.
A well-developed athlete, the tiger, can climb (although not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with a strength five times greater than that of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of grumbling, shouting words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If possible, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals hunted by the ocelot are relatively smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find their prey animals by scent, sniffing all the places they have been on the ground.
With night vision, they can see very well and also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings and then attacking it.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originated (for example, if they move beyond a mountain range or a river or if they are moved to a new island, so that they cannot easily return), they will permanently find themselves in a different environment that differs from their previous environment.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics and adaptations to be a strong competitor than was previously required.
The native population has not changed at all, they still need the same accommodations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they like the other populace less and less.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will become so different that it will be impossible to call them the same species.
We call this process "speciation," which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe, and they inhale carbon dioxide, which people exhale (i.e., release into the air).
Plants obtain their food through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants, and we make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it wasn't afraid of anything except other Mosasauruses.
In its long jaws were over 70 razor-sharp teeth, with an additional row in the upper part of its mouth, meaning that anything crossing its path could not escape it.
We don't know for sure, but it might have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it might even have been cannibalistic.
It attacked anything that entered the water, even the giant dinosaur Tyrannosaurus Rex was nothing to it.
While most of their food will be familiar to us, the Romans incorporated strange or unusual elements of animals, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another option was that while poor people and women sat in chairs eating their bread, the rich liked to hold banquets together, where they would recline beside each other while eating their dishes.
Ancient Roman dishes could not include foods that had come from Europe, America, or Asia in ancient times.
For example, they had neither corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The inhabitants of Babylon built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and the priests sought to meet the needs of the gods through rituals and celebrations.
Every temple has an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary where only priests can enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called "ziggurats," were built to form part of temples.
The upper part of Ashtarak was a special sanctuary for God.
In the warm climate conditions of the Middle East, the house did not hold much importance.
Most of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
The women were in the yard cooking, the shops had open displays facing the street. Stone was used for building houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive there.
Greenland is sparsely populated. Norwegian sagas note that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, as he traveled further west, discovered it and named it Greenland.
However, despite its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian," the differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland were numerous.
If you have watched the movie "National Treasure," you might think that a treasure map was depicted on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Despite the fact that something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were: ‚ÄúOriginal Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776.‚Äù The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document has previously been in storage (its dimensions are 29¬æ inches in length and 24¬Ω inches in width).
Therefore, it is possible that the annotation was added as a direct trademark.
The landings in Normandy and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was not yet freed.
It was governed by the "Vichy" French. They were French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1944, the Allies conquered Southern France, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and French independent forces had liberated southern France and were turning towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a fairly large group of people living together and collaborating‚Äîsociety.
The word "civilization" originates from the Latin word "civilis," which means "civilized," and is related to the Latin word "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning "city" or "city-state," and that also somehow defines the dimensions of society.
City-states are the prototypes of nations. Civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge between generations, a long-lasting cultural footprint, and the fair distribution of information.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving historical evidence and thus are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially created a weak central government, where under the Articles of Confederation, Congress was its only component.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since there was no executive or judicial national body, it relied on state authorities, who often refused to cooperate, in order to enforce all its laws.
It also did not have the authority to abolish tax laws and tariffs between the states.
Articles from all states required unanimous consent before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, is the joint second most successful team in the world and is the champion of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Among the well-known sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the Northern regions, and Italians compete in international games and the Olympic games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the world‚Äôs 7th largest island nation.
Due to Japan‚Äôs grouping of islands, from a geographical perspective, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago".
The beginning of Taiwan is considered to be the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating the transformation of the locals' grain cultivation practices and hiring Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895 (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, thereby ceding the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings located on the outskirts of the complex have been renovated to give tourists a better understanding of their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format of photographic still image in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size towards the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but the most important thing is that its width to height ratio has been inherited by the formats of digital camera image sensors.
The 35 mm format is actually somewhat confusing, being 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
Therefore, the ratio of the sides of this format (divided by twelve, to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Numerous common formats (e.g., the APS format family) are equivalent to or close to this aspect ratio.
The often trampled upon and frequently ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guide that creates dynamics while maintaining the size of order in the composition.
It notes that the most effective part of the main theme is the intersection of lines, which divides the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
The Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was under scrutiny during this period of European history.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united European states despite differences in language and customs.
The supremacy of its universal power affected everyone, from the king to the common mortal.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are specifically for that purpose.
The central structure of the Church was in Rome for about a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this dogma was being upheld.
Immediately after the hostilities began, Britain started the naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy was effective in stopping the supply of vital military and civilian goods, despite this blockade violating universally accepted international law enshrined in several international agreements adopted over the last two centuries.
Britain was exploring international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire sections of the ocean, posing a threat even to neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response regarding its submarine fleet's implementation of unrestricted military actions.
During the 1920s, the prevailing approach of many citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities during World War I, countries wanted to avoid a recurrence of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a job with the Edison Company located in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China used a unique way to mark different periods; each era under the rule of a family that came to power in China was considered a separate dynasty.
It was also an unstable period between provinces divided among various dynasties. The most famous of these periods was the "Three Kingdoms" era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce military actions took place among many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was the bloodiest era of ancient Chinese history, where thousands of people died fighting to seize the highest throne of the great Xian Palace.
There are a number of social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not just to one ruler.
In addition, after the revolution, professions were open to all male applicants, which allowed the more ambitious and successful to achieve success.
The same applies to the military, as they were now based on caliber rather than on a class-based army hierarchy.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed members of the working class in other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. To contemplate, he often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the "Nur" (light) mountain.
The cave that has survived through time vividly depicts Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave, perched on one of the northern mountains of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it is not easy to find at all, even if someone knows that it has existed. At one time, inside the cave, it was full isolation.
Apart from the clear and beautiful sky and the surrounding numerous mountains, nothing else can be seen. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still stands today.
The Egyptians built the Great Pyramid in the third century BC; it is one of the many large pyramid structures built in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau of the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, or "Giza Necropolis," contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, while many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed with the aim of honoring Khufu's wife and family members.
The "upward arrow" resembles a V, while the "downward arrow sign" is similar to a square bracket or a square with the bottom side missing.
Up means you should start from the top and draw the bow, and down means you should start from the part of the arrow (where your hand holds the bow) and draw the bow.
A highly held bow usually produces a milder sound, while a low held bow produces a stronger and more resolute sound.
You can use a pencil for your own notes, but remember that the printed bow marks are there for musical purposes, so they usually should be considered.
On October 6, 1789, the terror-stricken King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Th√©r√®se and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame √âlisabeth, were forced to flee from Versailles to Paris as a result of an attack by a group of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting and making threats towards the queen and the king.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open their carriage window wide.
A member of the crowd suddenly waved the head of a royal soldier killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The costs of the imperialist war conducted by the U.S. to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Philippines themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the USA in order to reimburse the interest and most of the expenses on the bonds placed on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the superprofits obtained from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the main achievements of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that contributed to the creation of that order.
The year when events took place is usually referred to as the Early Middle Ages, a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000 - 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally end around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, from the technological push or technological imperative to the very essence that human destiny progresses through the main logic, connected with scientific laws and other manifestations of technology.
The majority of interpretations of technological determinism share two main ideas: that the development of technology follows a path largely independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has inherent "effects" on societies rather than being determined by society.
For example, it can be said that the motor-driven car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, the road network spread across the country is not economically vital for only a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The mass management of vehicles on the roads also leads to a large number of accidents, which in turn results in the discovery of new techniques in the healthcare sector for treating injured bodies.
Romanticism is a major element of cultural determinism, observed in writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time the customs and culture associated with that geography accumulated; the latter, being in harmony with the wild of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
As a center of luxury, it became famous around 400 AD and lasted approximately until 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century, its status declined, particularly due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned bringing with them gifts such as silk items and spices, which were of greater value than those offered in the markets of Byzantium.
It was at that time that the fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style flourished in the 10-11th and 14th centuries.
In the early period, Byzantine culture had a significant influence on clothing in the East.
Anyway, due to the slow means of communication, styles in the West could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest achievements of that time was that buttons started to be used there to fasten clothing as a result of the Crusades.
The goal of subsistence agriculture is to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that uses seeds preserved for the specific ecological region, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to maximize yield.
Historically, many farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this still continues in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who think in the same way, feel neglected by social norms, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can vary due to age, ethnic affiliation, class, location, and/or the gender of the members.
The qualities that define a particular subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through the use of distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, affectation, and the misuse of terms.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is the examination of several unfortunate cases of children who, having gone through neglect, misery, and intentional abuse by adults, were not socialized by adults as they aged.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, abandoning a child in this way has been due to the parent's rejection of the child's severe mental or physical impairment.
The wild children may have endured cruel exploitation or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
It is assumed that others were raised by animals; some are said to have lived independently in the wild.
When a feral child is raised by non-domestic animals, they exhibit behavior (physically) that is almost completely similar to the behavior of particularly cautious animals, such as their fear or indifference towards humans.
Although software courses should make learning easier and more interesting, code generation is a step beyond.
The generation of codes is not a method of learning, but rather assistance to support individuals who are experiencing a new learning endeavor, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but so is the person with a small folder at Microsoft's office.
The virtual platforms are integrated into the software and are designed to question, prompt, and explain the procedures that may have been difficult for the student to overcome alone.
Children are placed in foster families for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to even exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment that does not nurture, care for, and educate, yet such environments still exist.
We believe that the foster family system is considered a safety net for these children.
Our foster families system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving guardians, stable education, and reliable medical care.
It is assumed that the adoptive family must meet all the needs that were not met in the home from which they were removed.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The differentiation of the internet leads to additional criteria in terms of usage and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Amy and McCord also considered that "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" are perspectives for having new incentives (1998) when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The filming has led to important discoveries in interpreting micro expressions and facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks in his article "The President's Speech" pointed out how people who are unable to comprehend speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even mentioned that animals, like domestic dogs, can have abilities to interpret human behavior.
Studies in the twentieth century have shown that there are two types of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new phylogenetic change, while selection removes it from the list of expressed changes.
Segregation and reassortment mix the variations that exist between the two unions of each generation.
Outside on the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to humans to meet its amino acid needs with the available plant resources.
Moreover, the inability to do so has serious consequences ‚Äì stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The more accessible plant resources would have been the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but as in our case, they are difficult for primates to digest unless they are cooked.
Unlike animals (ants, termites, eggs), the food is not only easier to digest, but also they provide a large amount of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
Considering all the circumstances, we should not be surprised to learn that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in somewhat the same way as chimpanzees do today in the savannah.
The interruption of sleep is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep and then going back to sleep shortly after (10-60 minutes later).
This can be easily done using a relatively calm alarm clock that will bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you are changing the alarm time again while asleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biological rhythms include drinking a lot of fluids (specifically, water or tea, known diuretics) before sleep, which makes a person wake up to urinate.
The measure of a person's inner peace is inversely proportional to the level of tension present in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the force towards life becomes. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can gain education. The only thing that hinders us in achieving this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has spread through the path of Mahayana love and various techniques of Indian yoga.
Principally, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditations, and the path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The Tibetan meditation center is divine yoga: The energetic pathways are cleansed through visualization of various deities, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to the cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, systemic, procedural, and cultural conflicts forced the countries to abandon the agreement they had reached.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years, and substitute, real armies were supposed to fight battles from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Polish defenses had already collapsed and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans evaporated almost overnight when approximately 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other both bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Using ships for transportation of goods has so far been the most efficient method for transporting large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The work of the naval forces has been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move its people and goods while at the same time hindering your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples related to this was the North Atlantic military operation during the Second World War. In an effort to assist Britain, the Americans were attempting to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German navy, which was mainly using its submarines, was trying to block this route.
If the allies had failed, Germany would most likely have been able to capture Britain, as it did with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran around 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve them to make milk, hair, meat, and skin easily available.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that grazed on hills or pastures, often tended by goatherds who were typically children or teenagers, similar to shepherds with larger flocks. These grazing methods are still used today.
The railways were built in England as early as the early 16th century.
Although the wagons were made only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses to pull them with the aim of reaching higher speeds and to pull larger loads than on the relatively not-so-smooth roads of the day.
The wooden sleepers of the railway were introduced quite early to hold the railway rails in place. However, it gradually became clear that the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with iron from above.
This became a common practice, but the iron on the wooden wheels of the wagons caused more wear.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron tracks were introduced.
The first known means of transportation was walking; human beings began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal adaptations have been identified in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more conscientiously with the environment, we can join the environmental protection movement, and we can become advocates to reduce future suffering even by some degree.
This is just like treating symptoms in many cases. In any case, if we want not only a temporary solution, then we must find the root of the problems and eradicate them.
It is evident that the world has changed greatly due to mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have increased as a result of overpopulation and people's reckless lifestyles.
When Congress adopted it on July 4, a handwritten copy, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's nearby shop-printing house.
During the night, 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
On July 8, the document was publicly read for the first time by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
To date, Dunleavy's 25 lineages, which are known to still exist, are the oldest surviving examples of the document. The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.
Today, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things are said about those birds that are still likened to dinosaurs.
They have scaly and clawed feet, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like tyrannosaurs.
In fact, all computers in use today are based on the processing of information encoded in the form of binary digits.
The binary system of computation can only have one of two values, for example, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits if we use computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are sufficiently common in nature, which makes immediate diagnosis difficult.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label to see the first aid instructions for this poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in an official sense for this group of insects.
This term originates from an old acquaintance with lice, which are insects greatly adapted to parasitize humans.
Assassin bugs and bedbugs are sedentary, adapted to living within the nest or dwelling of their host.
There are approximately 400,000 diagnosed cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) across the United States, which proves that it is still the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that negatively affects the nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The research found that women are twice as likely to have a Master of Science degree as men.
The couple may decide that raising the child is not in their or their child's best interests.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
During adoption, the biological parents of the child terminate their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method, in fact, guides fundamental scientific research.
However, it is not merely an experiment, rather an experiment is a test used to refute one or more plausible hypotheses through questions, and observations also guide the research work.
Philosophers and natural scientists focused their attention on classical texts, and in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all issues of science, including psychology, have been accepted.
Due to the decline in the knowledge of Greek, the West was severed from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have noticed that the repetition of physiology and behavior is often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and the creation of these cycles through biological clocks.
The periodic rhythms, which are not merely a response to external periodic cues, have been documented in the majority of living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to free-run even in the absence of external cues.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages and infections to transplant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments by labeling the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the portion of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Tourism in natural areas attracts people who want to visit natural sites to enjoy the scenery, as well as the flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, as well as studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing, and studying the orangutans in the city of Borneo.
Every morning people from suburban small towns drive to their workplaces, meeting others on the road whose workplaces are in the very towns they have just left.
In this fast suburban train, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now states that this mass economy of carbon has deviated the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human development over the past two million years.
Every person is a part of society and uses the transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the state of the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you will rarely hear complaints at such a level about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints, and why do they fail every day? Are the transport engineers unprofessional, or are more fundamental things happening?
The study of traffic flow examines the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying the flow of traffic is difficult because it is impossible to predict a driver‚Äôs behavior with one hundred percent accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers tend to maintain a fairly stable distance, therefore, the flow of traffic tends to have some reasonable consistency and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship has been established between three main characteristics: 1) flow, 2) density, and 3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road structures.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape predators more easily, forage for food, and find mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
This gives them a wide variety of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are cicadas and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the sun.
Some believed he was right, but many thought otherwise, that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolves around the Earth.
This seems reasonable because the Earth doesn't seem to move, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river by volume on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the water than the Earth's second largest river by volume.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with its width reaching up to six miles in certain sections.
Twenty percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is mainly 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. Waters from thousands of small rivers converge there.
Despite the pyramid-shaped structures made of stone surviving until the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza have never been surpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
The New Kingdom Egyptians marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were already over a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the world's smallest independent state with the least population.
The Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by many of the workers in the country, whereas Latin is often used during religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
In the ancient world, people knew about the existence of the basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, because these can be found in their natural form in nature and can be relatively easily mined using primitive tools.
Philosopher Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made of one or more than four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same sequence): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also suggests that they transform into new substances, forming what we see.
Alloys are primarily mixtures composed of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Surely, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter. All matter is made up of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly so small that trillions of them would fit in just the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, when the pencil appeared, it was a good friend for many.
Unfortunately, as newer methods of writing have emerged, the pencil has become less used and has gained a lower status.
People now write messages on computer screens, never having to approach a sharpener.
One can only guess what the keyboard will be like when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to bind a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Translating the first Armenian sentence yields: "It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill." Translating the second Armenian sentence results in: "By splitting the nucleus again, it then releases some of that energy."
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they are prone to decay with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The outer crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner in the water and thicker in the mountains.
There may be more eruptions on this side because the outer crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to spew out onto the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what motivates people to make choices or what seems attractive to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as they mature.
These theories aim to find out what compels some people to want certain things they do and what environmental factors will make them do or not do certain things.
The two well-known content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor theory.
Overall, two behaviors may emerge when managers begin to lead their former peers: One end of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the guys (or girls)."
This type of leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions with the public, implementing disciplinary actions, conducting performance evaluations, delegating responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the screen, a creature transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels the need to change everything the team has done and make his own moves.
Ultimately, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often causes conflict between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often act as a contact person for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may be unclear to their local management.
The presence of the actual "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
The invisible team is the leadership team to which every member reports. The invisible team sets standards for every member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing an educational institution? One of the goals of practically applying the organization's learning concepts is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity may be demonstrated when all resources available in the organization's functional operational departments are effectively utilized.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle may lead to a new innovative process that serves the needs of the customer.
Before any organization can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as of general knowledge and organizational learning.
Angele (2006) explains the Continuous Approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for taking a theoretical approach to cognitive research; therefore, it narrows the field of study and makes it much more precise.
The reciprocal link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The growth of new technologies allows us to see and investigate the structure and processes of the brain that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and materials to construct modeling examples that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has strong connotations of science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation to devices.
Research in artificial intelligence involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, scheduling, and agenda management, the ability to respond to customer diagnostics and inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such matters become separate scientific branches that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military because it has been developed in several computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a major part of any course. Very often, the teacher would like to take their students to places where it is not possible to go by bus.
The technology offers a solution through virtual field trips. Students can view cultural artifacts in museums, visit aquariums, or admire stunning artwork, all while being seated in their classroom.
Sharing about the excursion is also a good way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students from Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their visit to the state capital; the website is revamped each year, but the old versions are kept online as a record.
Blogs can also be helpful in improving students' writings. While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of readers largely changes that.
Since students are often the most critical readers, the blogger begins to strive to improve their written materials to avoid criticism.
Additionally, writing a blog "makes students more understanding of the world around them." The need to satisfy the audience's interest inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Engaging in blogging is a tool that promotes collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the boundaries of the traditional school day.
The normal use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by responding more actively to online materials, students can establish their positions within the context of others' writings, as well as outline their perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada, adorned with art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
South of there are the Niagara Falls, and to the north lies the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and the adjacent areas.
All of this and some other things highlight Ontario as what is considered by outsiders to be an exemplary Canadian city.
The larger areas lying further north are sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited deserts.
To compare the population, which surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the US than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean, far from the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is undoubtedly the largest and, in terms of wildlife, a unique continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or affiliated with France and are known as luxury resort beaches.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these countries, and it has traveled a long way in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region borders the Sahel, while in the south and west, it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
Women‚ÄîIt is recommended that any traveling woman say she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
Also, wearing a ring is beneficial (just not one that is too expensive).
Women need to realize that the result of cultural differences can be what they might consider harassment, and it's not uncommon to be followed, pulled by the hand, and so on.
Be resolute in rejecting men and do not be afraid to assert your opinion (whether it is a cultural disagreement or not, understood?).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and it was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and the Spanish merchants, who established trading posts there, named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco for shopping.
It's not difficult to find places in Medina that sell traditional Moroccan items such as the tagine dish, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide variety of pendants, but all of this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, covering the majority of the city's streets, particularly the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any trip outside of Goma should be studied to understand the state of military operations ongoing in North Kivu province.
The city is also a starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, chasing some of the cheapest mountain gorillas in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price for a short ride is ~500 Congolese francs.
The term "Timbuktu" was used as a metaphor for exotic, distant countries, due to its association with inaccessibility.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it attractive for tourists, as it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger due to the threat of desert sands.
That was one of Henry Louis's main stops during PBS's "Wonders of the African World" special.
The city is in sharp contrast with the other cities of the country, because it has a more Arab than African spirit.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, extending eastward along the border with Mozambique, northward with Zimbabwe, and the southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The garden covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different branches of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, conservation and daily entry fees apply.
Also, purchasing a Wild Card, which provides access to various parks in South Africa or all of South Africa's National Parks, can be advantageous.
The Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong territory and is a major attraction for many tourists.
The parade of buildings that forms Hong Kong's skyline is likened to a shimmering silhouette, which becomes noticeable thanks to the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite side, Kowloon Falls.
A major part of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore and is densely populated.
This is the place that the British colonizers considered theirs, so if you are looking for evidence of this location's colonial past, this is a good area to start with.
The Sundarbans are considered the world's largest coastal mangrove area, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland across the regions of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forested area within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not merely mangrove swamps; they include the last remnants of mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The area of the Sundarbans covers 3,850 square kilometers, of which about one-third is covered by aquatic/marshy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been wildlife sanctuaries, and it is estimated that there are around 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart throughout the day from the inter-district bus station (along the river), although those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 - 07:30.
Since interregional buses are often crowded, it is recommended to purchase the ticket in advance, a few days ahead.
Many areas are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Half-price taxis are a quick and convenient means for visiting nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River, connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil with Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The height of the two towers reaches 83 meters, its length is 378 meters, and it has two rows with a width of 3.5 meters.
The vertical crack beneath the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, and it had even remained closed to traffic until March 2017.
It is anticipated that the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, when the work of Brazil's customs is expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous groups that inhabited present-day Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters engaged in subsistence agriculture.
Other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, lived in the Chaco region, who survived by engaging in hunting, gathering, and fishing.
16th century Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indians," was created by the collision of Spanish conquerors and indigenous Indian tribes.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
When Asunci√≥n was founded in 1537, Paraguay was able to largely preserve its native character and identity.
Argentina is known as one of the countries with the best polo team and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Canitas polo fields.
On other days of the year, smaller tournaments and meetings are also held here.
To obtain information about places to purchase tickets for tournaments and polo games, see Asociaci√≥n Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP), which is equivalent to the British Pound (GBP).
It is possible to exchange money at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, beyond the western store of the Falkland Islands Company.
The British pound sterling is generally accepted in any part of the islands, as well as credit cards in Stanley. United States dollars are also often accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, but British and United States currencies might be, so check with the owners in advance to understand what payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange the currency before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; temperatures above +30¬∞C are common during the summer months.
In winter, it can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no definite "rainy" and "dry" seasons; according to rough estimates, the amount of rain remains the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the reserve's management, you must keep a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife.
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, reindeer, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Each year dozens of visitors are injured because they did not maintain sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild, and pose a potential danger, so give them their space.
Additionally, be aware that bears and other wildlife are attracted to scents, so avoid having or preparing fragrant foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu, and the population is less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was a site of inglorious naval inactivity in 1889, when seven ships of Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Around 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the peaceful gatherings occurring in the city during the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was killed.
There are many beaches in Auckland due to the two harbors that encompass it from both sides. The most famous ones are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the Northern Harbour area) are on the Pacific Ocean coast and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are all safe swimming sandy beaches, and most have shaded areas provided by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive's beaches are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a variety of shops lining the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One," it is a simple beer, but has a pleasant and refreshing nature. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines that should be had, but New Zealand and Australian wines can sell better.
The local tap water is perfectly drinkable, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
The idea of 'coffee with milk' is foreign to Australians. A short black is an 'espresso', a cappuccino is served with a lot of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to the Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but have an excellent taste.
Many underwater reef trips are conducted throughout the year, and injuries on the underwater rocks based on any of these reasons are very rare.
Listen to the authorities' advice as before, follow all the signs, and be attentive to the safety signals.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside these periods.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Many sharks are afraid of humans and swim far from the shore.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live only in the ocean; their primary habitats are the estuaries located north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep upon reaching their destination.
Tourist agents often make deals with specific hotels, although you can also book other types of accommodations, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers to and from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents (e.g., a visa) for your chosen destination.
Although any changes and inquiries should first be examined through a travel agency and not directly with the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, a significant majority of the visitors decide to camp at the location, and many visitors consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the concert, you need to enter early to pitch the tent close to the music.
Remember, even if the music on the main stages has ended, there might be some parts of the festival where the music continues until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas designed for families with small children.
If you have decided to cross the Northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin's location, as passing through the ice causes quite a terrifying noise for the most affected ones.
The cruise in Saint Petersburg also includes entertainment in the city. The cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to ensure that guests spend more time and money. Mainly, clocks and windows are absent, and the exit is hard to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to ensure guests are in a good mood and keep them inside the building.
In some places, alcoholic drinks are offered right in the house. However, intoxication clouds judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is planning to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the traction is low, and you cannot drive the car as if on bare asphalt.
In case of a snowstorm, a lot of snow can fall in a very short time and cover you.
Visibility may also be limited due to snow accumulating or blowing on the car windows or due to their thickening or ice on them.
On the other hand, the conditions of ice and snow are natural in many countries, and traffic continues almost continuously throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest attraction bringing tourists to Africa and the destination for many visitors.
The term safari is widely used for overland travel to observe Africa's impressive wildlife, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, typically approach vehicles, and standard equipment will provide the opportunity to see them up close.
Lions, leopards, and cheetahs can sometimes be shy and are better seen through binoculars.
Walking safaris (also known as "bush walks," "safari hikes," or "on foot") involve hikes ranging from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Several events will be organized in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city that has hosted two Summer Olympic Games, which were held in 1964.

There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient, while in other places, it takes a few minutes to do so.
The filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter unfamiliar pest animals in their places of residence.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation, or in worse cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can harm or forcibly kill people are not usually classified as pests.
Purchases exempt from customs duties allow the acquisition of goods free from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers departing for a country with a heavy taxation system can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on items such as alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont represents the most dangerous driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated deep forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, then keep your senses about you; steep slopes, narrow paths, and sharp twists are predominant.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than those of the preceding and following sections‚Äî35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)‚Äîand adherence to them is more important than anything else.
It is interesting that the cell phone service here is much stronger than in many other parts of the route, such as in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, the same can be said about their southern neighbor, Austria.
The fruit pastries are popular, apple pastries are made all year round, while cherries and plums give them a fresh touch during the summer.
Almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts are present in many German baked dishes. Favorite cookies often pair very well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small yet satisfying pastry, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish whose main ingredients are herbs and spices, made with either meat or vegetables.
Karrin can be both "dry" and "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.

Having around 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a general term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But if used without further qualifications, the term mainly refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.

The stirrups hanging from both sides of the saddle protect the rider's legs.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but they may have safety concerns since there is a possibility that the rider's feet might get caught in them.
If a rider falls off the horse but their foot remains in the stirrup, the horse might drag them if it runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of precautionary measures can be taken.
First, all riders wear shoes designed for horseback riding with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety locks that allow the stirrup leather to detach from the saddle when a falling rider pulls it back.
Cochamo Valley is Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America for its variety of large granite boulders and cliffs.

Skiing events, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve gliding over snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is the main travel activity for many enthusiastic people known as "ski fanatics," who plan their entire vacation in some special place for skiing.
The idea of skiing is very old; cave paintings depict skiers as far back as 5,000 years before the birth of Christ.
Skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Ski backpacking: this activity is also called cross-country skiing on remote trails, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It is related to alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering, but these are usually not included, as the latter are done on steep terrains and require much sturdier skis and boots.
Consider the ski route as a similar hiking route.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover some greater distances than by walking, but only very rarely will you achieve the skiing speeds of prepared ski trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Under ordinary circumstances, traveling through numerous countries would mean applying for visas several times and going through passport control procedures.
However, in this regard, the Schengen Area operates as a single state.
As long as you remain in this zone, you can generally cross the borders without going through passport control points again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply for a visa separately for each of the Schengen member countries, thereby saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured items are considered antiques. Some tax agencies classify items over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition depends on geographic variations, where the boundary of the era may be smaller in North America than in Europe.
Handmade items can be defined as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
The breeding of reindeer is an important source of livelihood in the Sami and surrounding cultures, and trade is also important for many with other professions.

As a rule, the course will present all the issues discussed here in much greater detail, usually with the help of practical experience.
The course will typically last 2-5 days and will include role-playing, information mostly related to first aid, and sometimes skills in handling weapons.
Books and magazines about surviving in the desert are popular, but publications about war zones are few.
Travelers who are planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documents for their return journey.
The readiness of governments to issue gender-unspecified (X) passports or documents to align with updated desired names and gender varies.

The security checks at checkpoints initiated in the era after September 11, 2001, have become even more tedious.
In the preoperative phase, transgender individuals should not expect to pass through scanners with their privacy and dignity remaining untouched.
The rip currents on the beach are the backflow of waves that occur after they collide with a reef or something similar.
Thanks to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in several deeper areas, and a strong current may develop there in deep water.
Many deaths result from exhausting attempts to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back will no longer be as difficult as usual.
Try to find places where you won't be caught again or, depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, you might want to wait for help.

Travelers who easily adapt to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, having adapted to a new culture and lost the customs characteristic of your homeland.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need time to adjust in a new country.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
One of the most interesting things in the children's section is the sound and light show of the pyramids.
In the darkness, you can see the pyramids, and you can see them in silence before the presentation begins.
You usually always hear the voices of tourists and merchants. The history of sound and light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is positioned as a backdrop and a narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and then different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the largest number of bases, sixteen of which are active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded crater of an active volcano still creates the view of a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region in the south of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here merge to become a plateau, then reunite to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains range, bifurcated by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range are the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is Mount Vinson, with an elevation of 4,892 meters.
In remote areas where there is no mobile connection, a satellite phone might be your only option.
Overall, a satellite phone does not replace a mobile phone, because to make phone calls, you need to be in an open area with a clear line of sight to the antenna.
The service is often used for freight transport, including yachts, as well as by expeditions, whose data is received remotely and have audio needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give more information about joining this service.
Traveling and learning are becoming increasingly popular options for gap year planners.
This is particularly popular among graduates, allowing them to take a one-year deferment before university without interrupting their education.
In many cases, by participating in a deferment course abroad, you can actually improve your chances of transferring to a higher education institution in your home country.
Usually, there is a tuition fee to be involved in these educational programs.
Finland is a major maritime terminal. "The Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in lakes and coastal archipelagos.
It is not necessarily that you need a yacht in archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed quite large for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks provide a completely different experience.
Rowing is considered a national pastime in Finland, with seven or eight people in each boat.
It corresponds to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but in other cases it is quite exceptional (for example, in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
The feature of the majority of memorable Baltic sea voyages is the long stopover in St. Petersburg, Russia.

For some, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome the fear that is based on the unknown or uncontrollable phenomenon.
Transport companies are well paid for delivering goods quickly. Often, time is very important for business documents, trade, or urgent repair parts.
In certain directions, larger companies have their own planes, but for other directions and smaller firms, it has been an issue.
If they ship the goods by air freight, on some routes it may take days to pass through customs and unloading.
The only way to get it faster was to send it as a checked baggage. The airline's regulations do not allow them to send the baggage to the visited country without a passenger.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to spend a lot of money on that privilege (or better yet, convince your company to do it for you).
Nevertheless, it is not cheap: as a practical rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times more than economy class for business class, and eleven times more expensive for first class.
Overall, it doesn't even make sense to look for discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of dollars for the advantage of getting to a place quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.

Do not deface the place by scratching marks or inscriptions on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, a vast majority understands it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
Anyway, many signs are in Catalan only because it is legally established as the first official language.

In the metro, regular announcements are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in several languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
While this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to adapt in Paris is to behave in a manner that shows you as someone who is "bien √©lev√©" (well-mannered). This will significantly ease the adaptation to the city.
The sharp exterior of Paris residents will quickly disappear if you show a few basic signs of courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes Park is densely forested, mainly with beech, coniferous trees and firs, and is a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a significantly wide diversity of plant communities due to the range of its microclimates, different types of soils, and varying levels of elevation.

Initially, all the animals that arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying, or with the water current.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, resulting in the giant tortoise becoming the main herbivore of the Galapagos.
Since humans set foot on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have appeared, including goats, horses, cows, rats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in the winter, you will see the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights when the sky will be more or less dark day and night.
