This confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread; furthermore, it also provides details that fossils do not have, such as color and three-dimensional distribution.
Scientists believe that the plumage of this animal was dark brown on top and carotenoid underneath.
The discovery also helps to understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the dinosaur did not have a well-developed shaft or rachis, but did have other characteristics such as plumaceous and downy barbs, the researchers concluded that it is likely that the rachis developed after the other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for regulating temperature or for display. The researchers suggest that, even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen has adult plumage and not that of a juvenile.
The scientists suggest that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not that of a juvenile.

The work that was done was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate the observations made in the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for was caused by the tidal force between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
In the same way that the moon attracts the earth, causing the tides, the Camino de Santiago exerts force in the galaxy of Sagittarius.
The scientists concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter in the galaxy is located around the galaxy in a circle, and is composed of many particles.

Even though the house was occupied by three people when the car crashed, they were not injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed while the emergency services extricated the driver of the Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Yarmouth.
Afterwards, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court accused of killing her son.
He is under custody pending charges and trial, but any eyewitness will remain under suspicion because of the public dissemination of their image.
It is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom but the Scottish justice system operates differently and the courts view the publication of images as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, from the University of Dundee, emphasizes that "journalists may be taking a risk if they publish photos and information about the suspects."
The Crown Office, which is in charge of the prosecution, told the journalists that no further comment would be made, at least until the charges are presented.
According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute, which the Palestinians want to be established with the boundaries that existed before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other discussed issues include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands ten years of permanent military presence in the valley after signing the agreement, while the PA agrees to allow such presence for only five years.
The additional pest control program shooters had to be closely supervised by the guards as the program was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
The partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc selected qualified volunteers as part of the sports shooters association's hunting program.
Memories with Mick O'Flynn, interim director of Conservation of Parks and Heritage of the NPWS, the four shooters chosen for the first hunt received full training in safety and practice.
Martelly was sworn in the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the provisional electoral council (CEP) as part of a set of measures aimed at leading the country to new elections.
The commission was the response that Martelly gave to the thousands of protests against the regime that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the inability to organize elections, some of which should have taken place in 2011.
There were reports of around 60 cases of iPods malfunctioning due to overheating, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said they were referred 27 cases of accidents with the devices.
A week ago, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan announced that Apple reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as “not serious.”
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of Apple's report “truly regrettable”.
The earthquake shook Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:10 p.m. on Friday GMT).
The emergency management office of the Northern Mariana Islands said that no significant damage was reported in the nation.
Moreover, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held several Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several people held captive were rescued and there are at least six confirmed victims.
Six hostages were freed, including the children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman while she went to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as a gynecologist and started working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
When he worked at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature birth in his free time.
Her research showed that if a hormone was administered, fetal lung maturation could be accelerated.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two “black boxes” recorders from Wednesday's flight.
The fellow fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. As unique as she was. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna is as weird as I am... maybe even more so... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Of 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, those who oppose Australia becoming a republic increased by eight percent since 2008.
The interim prime minister, Julia Gillard, said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
The 34 percent of the people in the survey share this point of view, wanting Elizabeth II of England to be the last monarch of Australia.
As results of the survey, 29 percent of those consulted believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never be one.
The Olympic gold medalist was going to swim in the 100 and 200 m freestyle and in three relays in the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition is in doubt.
He couldn't take the necessary medications to overcome the pain because they are banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the highest prime number on January 25.
Many people verified the discovery with various hardware and software at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets can be a source of bringing water to the earth along with organic material that could form proteins that support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth was formed, because comets collided with Earth a lot.
Cuomo, 53, began his term at the start of this year and signed a law last month to legalize same-sex marriages.
He referred to the rumors as “political chatter and nonsense.”
It is speculated that he will run for presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration says would allow aircraft to make shorter flights, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It makes use of satellite technology instead of old technology based on ground-based radar technology. With this, it aims to allow air traffic controllers to establish the position of aircraft more precisely and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There is no extra transport and surface trains do not stop at Wembley, and parking and short-term parking are not available on the surface.
The fear of lack of transport opened up the possibility that the match would be played behind closed doors without the presence of the teams’ fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process is assumed to have taken much longer due to the breeding between a Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take many forms. It can be rolled into fine shapes.
It can be made into fine wire, to handle and braid. It can be forged or made into sheets with it.
It can be made very fine and inlaid into another metal. It can become so fine that sometimes it was used to decorate the miniatures of some books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (basic) the substance is.
The pH level indicates the amount of oxygen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemical.
English sentence: Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (because hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two types of dry powder and then, with clean and wet hands, press it into a ball shape.
The moisture from your hands will react with the outer layers. You will feel something strange as it forms a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had cistern toilets in practically every house, linked to an advanced sewage system.
Remains of drainage systems were found in the Minoan houses of Crete and Santorini.
There were also baths in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, the baths were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. The scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere alters part of the light and vision.
It is necessary to have a rocket 100 feet tall to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing that the invention did for us was to provide easier and faster transportation.
The train, the car, and many other transports brought us.
Below them are medium-sized felines that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including common cats) that eat smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of success is the concept of niche, a special task that each of the cats has and that prevents it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called prides.
Groups consist of one to three related males along with up to thirty females and pups.
The females are often related to each other, forming a large family of daughters and sisters.
The prides of lions function in a manner similar to those of wolves or dogs, animals that resemble lions a lot (although not other big cats) in their behavior and which are also very harmful to their prey.
The tiger is a complete athlete: it can climb (although not very well), swim, jump good distances, and exert five times the strength of a human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the mighty roar of the lion; it is like a phrase of hoarse words shouted.
Ocelots enjoy eating small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
The scientists think that ocelots search for and find animals to eat (hunt) using their sense of smell, sniffing their trail on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision, and also move very smoothly. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging with the environment and jumping on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) breaks away from the original population (such as moving to live in the mountains, by the river, or relocating to an island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than they were before.
The original population hasn't changed a thing, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adapted to their new environment, they began to resemble the rest of the population less and less.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will become so different that they will not be able to be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable and very important consequence for evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, release).
Plants make their food by photosynthesizing the sun. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and our clothes from plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, so it wasn't afraid of anything, except other mosasaurs.
Their large jaws have more than 70 teeth sharpened like knives with an extra set on the roof of the mouth, which means that there is no escape for anything that crosses their path.
We are not entirely sure, but it might have had a forked tongue. It ate turtles, large fish, mosasaurs, and it could have been a cannibal.
It attacked anything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like the T. Rex was a match for it.
While most of their food would seem familiar to us, the Romans had quite a few strange or unusual items, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference is that while poor people and women eat their meals sitting on chairs, rich men hold banquets together where they will be lying on their side while eating.
The ancient Roman meals could not include food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa. And no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple that was considered the house of the god.
The people made sacrifices to the gods, and the priests sought to attend to the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard and inside it an inner sanctuary that only the priests can enter.
Occasionally special towers in the shape of pyramids, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not as important.
A large part of the life of the Hebrew family was outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the stores were counters that faced the street. To build houses, stone was used.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic sagas, it is said that Eric the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling west, he encountered Greenland and named it as such.
But without considering this discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each of the countries is “Scandinavian,” there are many differences among the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence was written "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text is at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although it is not known who wrote it, it is known that initially, the parchment (29.75 by 24.50 inches) was rolled up for storage.
Then, it seems likely that the notation will only be added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated the north, but the south was not yet liberated.
It was governed by the Vichy faction, who were the French that became allies with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the south of France. The invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the American forces and the Free French Forces will liberate the south of France and head towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a representative group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, it is related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and in a way, it defines the greatness of society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. A civilizational culture involves passing knowledge along many generations, maintaining a cultural legacy, and significant expansion.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving historically significant traces and are not properly recognized as civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government – with Congress as the sole component – under the Articles of Confederation.
The congress did not have the power to levy taxes and, as there was no national executive or judicial power, it depended on the state authorities, who tended not to cooperate, to pass all the laws.
He also had no authority to annul fiscal legislation or tariffs between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states took so little notice of the central government that the representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second team with the most victories in the world and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Among the popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, there are Italians who participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Due to the group of islands that the country has, Japan is geographically an archipelago.
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by there recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1627, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, initiating a transformation of the grain production practices of the aborigines and employing Chinese workers in the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the west and north coasts of Taiwan; they declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which would govern the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex were reconstructed to give tourists a more reliable idea of how they were originally.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant size of films at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but the most important thing is that its aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format has, paradoxically, a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this format (divide by 12 to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (from the APS family, for example) have an equal or very similar ratio.
The rule of thirds, so often used and sometimes ridiculed, is a simple guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining a certain order in an image.
He claims that the most effective place for the main subject is the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and gained power, was subject to scrutiny.
The Christian religion united different European states for more than a thousand years, despite the differences in language and culture.
His overwhelming power affects all levels of society, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that riches should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds exist precisely for this purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led to questioning whether this principle was being respected.
Shortly after the beginning of the war, Great Britain initiated the naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off military and civilian supply, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law and ratified by several international agreements of the two previous centuries.
United Kingdom placed mines in international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire sections of the ocean, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
As the response to this tactic was poor, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the most widespread attitude among the majority of citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After experiencing the horrors and harshness of war during the First World War, the nations wished to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in the city of New York.
He arrived in the United States of America with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing distinct periods of time; each era of China or each family that held power was a distinctive dynasty.
Also, between each dynasty, there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods is the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there were fierce wars between nobles who clawed at each other for the throne.
The era of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to sit on the highest seat of the great palace of Xi'an.
It resulted in many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the conviction that the country belongs to its people and not to a single ruler.
Moreover, with the Revolution, positions opened up to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and wealthy to succeed.
The same happens with the army because instead of basing military classifications on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters of worldly life. He used to go to a cave that became known as Hira on Mount Noor (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived the passage of time, provides a clear image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
On the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca is this cave, completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find at all, even knowing of its existence. Once inside the cave, one is in total isolation.
Nothing else can be seen but the beautiful and clear sky and the mountains that surround it. Few things from this world enter this cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many pyramidal constructions made as a tribute to the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or the "Giza Necropolis", located in the Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to pay homage to Pharaoh Khufu and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples to honor his wives and relatives.
The "arc upwards" symbol resembles a V and the "arc downwards" symbol resembles a staple or a small square without the bottom line.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An arc from above generates a softer sound, while one from below is stronger and more assertive.
You can take notes, but remember that the printed bracket marks are there for musical reasons and must be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (eleven-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis Charles), and the king's sister, Elisabeth of France, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a crowd of working market women.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and yelling threats against the King and the Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to fling open the windows of their carriage.
In a moment, a member of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The costs of war of the United States imperialism in the Philippine war were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States of America to cover a large part of the expenses and interest of the bonds advanced in the name of the Philippine government through banking institutions of Wall Street.
Of course! Asturian sentence: Dende llueu, los superbeneficios derivaos de la esplotación prollongada de los filipinos foron les principales ganancies del imperialismu de los Estaos Xuníos. English sentence: Indeed, the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipinos were the main gains of the United States’ imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which the events unfold is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history from the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early High Middle Ages, and it was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses in practice a vast array of ideas, ranging from technological impetus or technological imperative to a strict sense in which human destiny is dominated by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and its manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology in itself follows a path that is far removed from political or cultural influence and that technology, for its part, has effects on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that the car necessarily encourages the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable with only a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The possession of a large number of cars also leads to a greater number of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques to repair damaged bodies.
The Romanticism had much of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures emerged tied to this geography, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than the arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is seen as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
Its status fell in the 12th century particularly because the crusaders returned bringing gifts like silk and spices that were worth more than what was offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was then that the title of Fashion Capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style emerged during the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the clothing in the east was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture.
However, through the slow communication channels, western styles could remain 25 or 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the era was that people started using buttons to fasten their clothes, as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence agriculture is the type that is done to have sufficient production to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple and often ecological system that uses seeds from the ecoregion along with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, farmers developed subsistence agriculture and this is what happens in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel a rejection of societal standards and help them develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be characteristic of the age, ethnicity, class, place, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine that a culture is distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture tend to show their belonging through the use of a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashions, gestures, and slang.
One of the most common methods to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to point out the few and unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, bad luck, or premeditated abuse, were not socialized with adults while they were growing up.
These children are called "xabaces" or savages. Some were confined (generally by their own fathers and mothers); in some cases, this abandonment of the children is due to the parents' rejection in the face of a severe physical or mental disability.
The stray children might have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Some are believed to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, wild children exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) almost identical to those of the animals that cared for them, such as their fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but rather a support that aids individuals who are undergoing a learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be virtual or real, in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but so is the Microsoft Office paperclip assistant.
The virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and aim to question, remind, and explain the procedures that may have been difficult for the student to tackle on their own.
Children go to foster homes for many reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment without care, education, and affection, but they do.
We believe that the Foster Care service is a safe environment for these children.
Our welcome system provides safe homes, caring caregivers, regular education, and quality healthcare.
It is assumed that foster homes provide all the resources that were lacking in the home from which they were removed.
Internet combines elements of interpersonal and mass communication.
The particularities of the internet allow for additional dimensions in what concerns the uses and gratifications theory.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
The personal involvement and ongoing relationships were identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) in their research on the public's reaction to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important discoveries in the field of micro-expressions, facial movements that last just a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is ensured that no one can detect if someone is lying through the correct interpretation of micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his work The President’s Speech, indicated that people who are unable to understand language due to brain damage are, however, capable of evaluating sincerity accurately.
He suggests that these skills in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals like domestic dogs.
The investigations of the twentieth century showed that there are two genetic reserves: latent and expressed.
The mutation adds genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of expressed variation.
The segregation and recombination generate variation between two genetic reserves each generation.
There in the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to be able to meet its amino acid needs with the available plant resources.
Additionally, not doing it has serious consequences: it increases depression, poor nutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest plant resources to find would be the proteins from leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
On the other hand, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest but also provides proteins that contain the essential amino acids.
Considering everything, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors resolved their "protein problems" in the same way that savanna chimpanzees do today.
The interruption of sleep is the process of voluntarily waking up during your usual sleep period and falling back asleep shortly after (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be achieved easily using an alarm that is not too loud, which wakes you up without startling you completely.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm while sleeping, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a famous diuretic) before sleeping, forcing oneself to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension the body and spirit have.
The less tension there is, the more positive the vital energy. Every person has the ability to achieve complete peace and joy.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that can prevent us is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it expanded with the path of love from Mahayana and many techniques from Indian yoga.
Initially, Tibetan Buddhism is experiential. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love and acceptance.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and conscious illumination is created.
Germany was the common enemy in the Second World War, which caused the USSR and the United States of America to cooperate. At the end of the war, the confrontations between the systems, the processes, and the culture led to the distancing of the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were already enemies and the Cold War began.
It was going to last for the next 40 years and was truly going to be fought by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was broken, the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight after more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Riga peace treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient means to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The armed forces are responsible for ensuring that your country maintains its capacity to move citizens and goods while interfering with the enemy's ability to move population and goods.
One of the most notable nearby examples is the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The United States was trying to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies fail, it is likely that Germany will conquer Great Britain and the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains, in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and leather.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the mountains or other grazing areas, and were tended by goatherds, who often were boys or young men, similar to the more familiar shepherds. These methods of care are still used today.
The first roads were built in England in the 16th century.
Although the wagonways were nothing more than parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to gain more speed and haul larger loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
The sleepers were soon introduced to support the tracks. Little by little, however, it was realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they had a strip of iron on top.
This became a normal practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
In the end, the iron wheels replaced the wooden wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first known transport is walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
The australopithecines, their predecessors, weren't usually so skillful.
The bipedal specialization was found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it seems that Sahelanthropus might have already walked upright seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
It is like a symptomatic treatment in most cases. However, if we want more than just a temporary solution, then we will need to find the root of the problems, and we will have to deactivate it.
It's quite clear that the world has changed enormously due to the advances of science and human technology; the problems only keep growing because of overpopulation and the wasteful lifestyle.
After being adopted by the Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of the Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the nearby printing house of John Dunlap.
At night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on June 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. Another copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 copies that are known to still exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and fly.
Although there are many things in birds that remind one of dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and spurs, lay eggs, and walk on their hind feet like tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all modern computers handle information encoded in binary system.
A binary number can only have two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits – or bits, using computer jargon.
The internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are too general to make an early diagnosis.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicines or household chemical products.
Read the label to obtain specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in the formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects adapted to parasitize humans.
Bedbugs and reduviid insects make nests, adapting to live in the nest or house of their host.
In the United States of America, there are around 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple can decide that raising a child is not what suits them best or what is best for them.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents lose parental rights so that another couple can have them over the girl.
The primary goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most scientific research.
However, it is not just experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses by asking questions, making observations, and guiding scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
The opinions of Aristotle were accepted in all aspects of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek diminished, the West found itself isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many noticed that the rhythms in psychology and behavior heavily depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their manifestation in internal clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simple responses to periodic external stimuli, are documented in the majority of living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that maintain a free-running cycle even in the absence of external signals.
The experiment of Hershey and Chase was conclusive in determining that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, which are viruses, to introduce their DNA into the bacteria.
They conducted two experiments by marking the DNA of the phage with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with a radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects, depending on the type, the significance of the genetic material fragment, and whether the affected cells are germline.
Only mutations in germ cells have genetic transmission, although other types of mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including the plants and wildlife.
Some examples of activities are hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting parks to study information about their ecosystem.
An example is to visit, photograph, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small towns in cars to go to their workplaces and cross paths with people who work in the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport hub, everyone is connected and supports a transport system based on the private car.
The science now indicates that this coal-intensive economy has shifted the biosphere from one of the stable states that facilitated human evolution in the last two million years.
All people participate in society and use means of transport. Almost everyone complains about those means of transport.
In developed countries, there is almost never the same level of complaint about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints? Why do they do it daily? Are the transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental behind it?
The flow of traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to have reasonably uniform behavior; therefore, traffic flows are often reasonably constant and can be represented, approximately, in a mathematical way.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships were established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help to plan, design, and carry out the road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape from enemies more easily and find food and reproduce conveniently.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their bodies.
This allows them to hide from predators in a larger number of small places.
This year, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many others believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems to be what the senses perceive, because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the flow of the second river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world because at some points it reaches 6 miles.
The 20 percent of the water that reaches the oceans from the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River measures 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It gathers water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size nor the technical excellence of the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were already well over a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and communication.
The Italian is the usual language of most state workers, while Latin is also used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Catholic.
Some basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, or copper have been known since antiquity, and all of them can be found in nature as native metals, being easy to extract using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, had the theory that all things are made of mixtures of one or more elements, which were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they changed into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also make alloys with small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
All things in the Universe are made up of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles, atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly tiny that billions of them could fit into the period that ends this sentence.
Thus, with its invention, the pencil made life easier for many people.
Sadly, with the advent of new writing methods, the pencil is relegated to a lesser status and use.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever having to touch a typewriter.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new appears.
The fission bomb uses the principle that it takes energy to gather a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Splitting the nucleus again releases part of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the closest side and 100 km on the farthest side.
It is finer in the seas and larger in the highlands.
There might have been more whirlpools in the nearby area because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface.
Theories of content focus on finding what moves or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized while maturing towards adulthood.
These theories analyze what is it in certain people that makes them want to do the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Speaking generally, two behaviors arise when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One extreme is to continue being "one of them."
This type of boss struggles with making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning roles, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one changes and becomes an unknown individual who believes they must change everything the team did and make it their own.
After all, the leader is the ultimate responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often causes rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual groups have the same standards of excellence as conventional ones, but there are slight differences.
The members of the virtual team usually function as the point of contact for their direct physical group.
They tend to have more autonomy than conventional team members since they can meet according to different time zones, something that may not be understood by the local management.
The presence of a truly "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which all members refer. The invisible team sets the standards for its components.
Why would an organization want to go through the long process of creating a learning organization? One of the methods to introduce learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process of working together to overcome an obstacle by an organization can promote a new innovative process that is available to meet the client's needs.
Before the organization can innovate, the leadership must generate a culture of innovation and common knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous improvement perspective as a method used for organizations to achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data shows physical evidence of a theoretical approach to cognition research, which reduces the research area and makes it much more exhaustive.
The correlation between brain pathologies and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for some time that brain damage of different types, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect our behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The growth of new technologies allows us to see and research brain structures and processes that were never seen before.
That provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes of our mind.
Although AI sounds like something out of science fiction, it is a very important part of computer science that deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
Research in Artificial Intelligence enables machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnostics and inquiries, as well as recognizing handwriting, voices, and faces.
Such fields have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions for everyday problems.
The AI system is now used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, and was built for the benefit of personal computers and video game software applications.
Excursions are an important part of any class. The teacher always enjoys taking the students to places where you can't go by bus.
Technology provides a solution with virtual excursions. Students can see museum objects, visit an aquarium, or engage with artworks while they are in the classroom.
Sharing an excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennet School in North Carolina design a website for their trip to the Capital City; they remodel the previous one, but keep the versions as templates.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students may start the blog with neglected grammar and spelling, the pressure of the audience usually changes this.
Since the students are usually the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve the writing to prevent those critiques.
Participating in a blog also "makes students gain greater knowledge of the world around." The need to feed the public's interest inspires the students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Writing a blog is an activity that stimulates collaboration and motivates students to also learn outside of schools.
The good use of blogs "motivates students to critical analysis; with active exposure to content on the Internet, students define their opinions with the texts of other people and shape their stance on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming and bilingual capital of Canada, with plenty of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and the north hosts the unexploited natural beauty of the Muskoka region and beyond.
All that and more make Ontario the basic Canadian for foreigners.
There are large areas in the north with low population, some are practically uninhabited lands of wild nature.
To make a comparison of population that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The eastern islands of Africa are in the Indian Ocean, near the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in itself when it comes to animal life.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury and beach tourist centers.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, with a special focus on Comoros and Mayotte.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the Cape route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west with the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that women say they are married, regardless of their marital status.
It helps a lot to wear a ring (although not one that seems very expensive).
The women have realized that cultural differences may lead them to consider intervening, and it's not uncommon for them to follow us, grab our arm, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men, and do not waver in defending your position (with or without cultural differences, it is not acceptable).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century AD and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya, and the Spanish merchants who established bases there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to go shopping in all of Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a variety of trinkets, all intended for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, for any visit outside Goma, one must be informed about the state of the conflict in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, as well as one of the cheapest places in all of Africa for excursions to see mountain gorillas.
You can go by boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
This year, Timbuktu is an improvised city, although its reputation makes it a tourist city. It has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage monuments in danger due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the most important stops for Henry Louis Gates in the special “Wonders of the African World” on PBS.
The city has a clear contrast with the rest of the cities in the country because it has a more Arab than African atmosphere.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting a unique type of life.
It's one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the foremost of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
Regarding the national parks of South Africa, they have conservation and park access fees.
It can be good for someone to buy a Wild Card, which allows entry to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all the South African National Parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists see as the main attraction.
The row of buildings that forms the urban landscape of Hong Kong has been compared to a shining bar chart, aided by the presence of the water of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island to go to the Kowloon waterfront which is directly opposite.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is located on land reclaimed from the sea along the north coast.
This is the place that the British settlers took as their own, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) into the interior territories of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The forest area in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not mangroves, but rather contain remnants of the majestic jungles that once covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans extend over an area of 3,850 km², of which one third corresponds to aquatic or swampy zones.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans has been an animal sanctuary; currently there are about 400 Bengal tigers and about 40,000 chitals in the area.
The buses leave from the intermodal station (on the other side of the river) during the day, with most, especially those going east or to Jakar/Bumthang, departing between 06:30 and 07:30.
As the buses between districts are often crowded, it is recommended to buy the ticket days in advance.
In most districts, the small Japanese coastal buses arrive, which are comfortable and strong.
Shared taxis are fast and convenient means to go to nearby areas like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l’Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long, and has two lanes each 3.5 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Its construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
It is estimated that the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, by which time it is expected that the Brazilian customs posts will be completed.
The Guarani people were the most important indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The region of Chaco was home to other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, called “the giant province of the Indies,” was born as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began the colonial period, which lasted three centuries.
Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and one of the best soccer players in the world.
The biggest annual competition takes place in December at the Las Cañitas polo field.
Here you can see more modest tournaments or matches at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and information on where to buy tickets for polo matches, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to the British pound (GBP).
The money can only be exchanged at the bank of the islands, in the town of Stanley (in front of the FIC West store).
The pound notes are generally accepted on the islands, and in Stanley credit cards and American dollars are also accepted.
In remote islands it is easy for credit cards not to be accepted, although British or United States currency is. Check with the owners in advance to know which payment method is accepted.
It's practically impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside of the islands, so exchange the money before leaving there.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, temperatures above 30ºC are common.
The winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the air and the humidity combined make it feel colder than what the thermometer shows.
There is no specific “rainy” or “dry” season: the rain remains practically the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the animals are wild and should not be disturbed or fed.
According to the park authorities, you must maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from other wild animals!
English sentence: No matter how tame they seem, bison, moose, bears, and other large animals can attack you.
Every year, many visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so their space must be respected.
You have to keep in mind that scents attract bears and other types of animals; it's better to avoid wearing perfume or cooking fragrant dishes and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The shell was the stage for a notorious naval confrontation in the year 1889 when seven German, British, and United States ships refused to leave it.
They sank all the ships, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the fight for independence, organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of the high chief Tupua Tamamese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, because Auckland is located between two harbors. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The sandy beaches on the north coast (in the North Harbour district) face the Pacific Ocean; they stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are safe sandy beaches, and most have pohutukawa tree areas that provide shade.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are in Waitemata Harbour, in the luxury suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are usually beaches filled with families with a variety of shops along the shore. It is safe to swim.
The main local beer is the "Number One," which is not complex but rather pleasant and fresh. The other local beer is the "Manta."
There are numerous varieties of French wine to taste, but those from New Zealand and Australia might travel better.
The tap water in the area can be safely drunk, but bottled water is easy to find if you don't trust it.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is something foreign. A black coffee is an "espresso", cappuccino comes with cream to the top (not froth), and tea is drunk without milk.
The hot chocolate is at the level of the Belgians. The juice is expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the coral barrier are made every year, and injuries from these causes there are rare.
However, follow the recommendations, respect the signs, and be cautious with the safety measures.
The box jellyfish appear near the beaches and rivers from October to April north of 1770. Sometimes they can be found outside these dates.
Sharks exist, however, it is rare for them to attack humans. Most avoid humans and leave if they see them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live entirely in the sea. Their primary habitat is the rivers north of Rockhampton.
Making a reservation in advance gives peace of mind to the traveler, and this way, they have a place to sleep upon arriving at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although it is possible that you can find other ways to accommodate yourself like camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, transport to the airport, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (for example, the visa).
Any change or request must be managed with the travel agency first, not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of attendees decide to camp, and for many, it is an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the stages you have to go early to camp near the music.
Keep in mind that although the music ends on the main stages, there will be sections of the festival that will continue playing music until very late at night.
Some festivals have camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the north of the Baltic in the winter, look where the cabin is: if you sail with ice there is a lot of noise.
The cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. For cruise passengers, a visa is not required at all (see terms).
Casinos strive to maximize the time and money that customers spend. There are usually no windows or clocks, and the exits are difficult to find.
In general, they have special food, drinks, and entertainment offerings to keep the guests in a good mood and stay on the premises.
Some houses offer alcoholic beverages for free. However, being drunk is being out of control and all good gamblers know the importance of being sober.
Any person who is going to drive in high latitudes or mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice, or very low temperatures.
On icy or snowy roads, traction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
In snowstorms, enough snow can fall to trap you in a very short time.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfalls or blizzards or by the condensation of ice on the windows of vehicles.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries, and traffic continues without interruption all year.
Safaris are perhaps Africa's greatest tourist attraction and a significant experience for visitors.
The term 'safari' is popularly used to refer to overland trips to see the stunning African wildlife, especially that of the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach the cars, and the standard equipment allows for good views.
The lions, the cheetahs, and the leopards can be cowardly, and it's better to see them with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "savannah walk," "hiking safari," or "to go tramping") consists of walking, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Several events will take place in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice, having already hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before it was postponed, you could be in a complicated situation.
Policies vary, but since the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellations do not cover July 2020, the dates of the Games.
It is estimated that most of the entries will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with an average price of ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothing can help dry it. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for rent, even if they are not in the room.
If there are no clothes or if you don't feel like having to iron even the socks, you can try using a dryer (if you have one).
Be careful that the fabrics do not reach high temperatures (which can cause them to shrink or, in extreme cases, to burn).
There are different ways to filter water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas boiling water for one minute is enough, in others several minutes are needed.
The effectiveness of the filters varies, and if you have a concern, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they are not used to in their countries of origin.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in a worse case, provoke allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are not generally considered pests.
Buying in stores tax-free books is the way to purchase goods exempt from direct and indirect taxes in some places.
Travelers going to countries with high taxes can save a good amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated areas and forests.
If one is not accustomed to driving on country roads, one must be attentive: there are many steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves.
The speed limits on the signs are much lower than in the previous and subsequent sections—usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h)—and it is very important to stay within them.
Strangely, the mobile phone service is much stronger here than in many other sections of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples as an ingredient all year round and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
Many German bakery products contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The most popular cakes usually pair well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to taste delicious pastries, try the ones that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
The curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is generally used with curry; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is generally used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is the term that encompasses the enormous variety of regional cuisines in the country.
But if no more adjectives are used, the term refers to the food originally from the center and east of the main island of Java.
Now available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a variety of simple dishes. The predominant flavors are peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and several aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on each side of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability but can compromise their safety due to the risk of their feet getting caught.
If a rider falls off a horse but has their foot stuck in the stirrup, they can end up being dragged if the horse runs. To reduce this risk, some safety precautions need to be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a soft, thin sole.
Behind, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup to fall from the saddle if a rider pulls on it when falling.

Ski touring: also called cross-country skiing, backcountry skiing, or ski hiking.
It is linked but usually does not involve ski or mountaineering trips, with this latter discipline being done on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski slope as something similar to a mountain trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover longer distances than walking – but only very rarely will you be able to reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a backpack and on prepared trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal conditions, traveling through many countries would mean having to apply for many visas and going through passport controls many times.
However, the Schengen Area functions as if it were a single country in this aspect.

Similarly, with a Schengen visa you do not need to apply for visas for each member country of the area; you save time, money, and paperwork.

Finland is a splendid destination for sailing. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes, it is not necessary to have a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even canoes offer a different experience.
Sailing is the national hobby of Finland, which has one boat for every seven or eight people.
This figure is also reached in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it is somewhat unique (e.g., in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises make a long stop in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city in a few days even if you return and sleep on the boat at night.
If you only disembark on excursions, you are exempt from carrying a special visa (since 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As can be seen in the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and visits to the city are not included in the cruise price.

Generally, it is not usual to search for discounts for first-class or business-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain main group of travelers who are willing to pay well for the privilege of going quickly and comfortably, and they charge them accordingly.
