"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini lexi nga ta tekiwa ku nga ri xitsundzuxo lexi kongomeke leswaku u tlanga kositina hi ndlela leyi humelelaka?","The correct answer is **B: U nga famba fambi ku nga laveki ku hlayisa matimba ya wena**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically says ""*ringeta ku nga fambisi tintiho ta wena hi tindlela tin’wana Hi ndlela leyi, u ta endla leswaku u nga karhali hi laha swi kotekaka hakona*,"" meaning you **shouldn't** move your fingers unnecessarily to save energy. Option B says to do the opposite.

Let's look at why the other options are correct advice based on the passage:

*   **A: Ku engetela mpfumawulo, engetela matimba lama u yimbelelaka hawona:** The passage states, ""*Ka kositina, leswaku u kuma mpfumawulo wo engeteleka, u tirhisa xihuhuti hi ku engetela ntshikelelo ni rivilo*"", this implies more force used to drive air through the instrument.
*   **C: Xiya leswaku u ba tinotsi hala voko ra wena ri tshama ri ntshunxekile:** The passage starts with ""*Tiyiseka leswaku nhloko ya wena yi ntshunxekile hi laha swi kotekaka ha kona loko u ri karhi u chaya tinoto hinkwato hi ndlela leyi faneleke*"", the same can be said for the hand to ensure notes are hit correctly.
*   **D: Engetela rivilo leri fambisaka xihuhuti ku kuma mpfumawulo wa le henhla ngopfu:** The passage says, ""*Ka kositina, leswaku u kuma mpfumawulo wo engeteleka, u tirhisa xihuhuti hi ku engetela ntshikelelo ni rivilo*"" explicitly advising increasing the speed of the bellows to create a greater sound."
"Loko u tlanga kositina, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga ta ku pfuna ku engetela mpfumawulo?","The correct answer is **A: Rivilo leri engetelekeke**.

The passage states: ""Ka kositina, leswaku u kuma mpfumawulo wo engeteleka, u tirhisa xihuhuti hi ku engetela ntshikelelo ni rivilo."" This translates to ""On a concertina, to get more volume, you use the bellows by increasing pressure and speed.""  Therefore, increased speed (rivilo leri engetelekeke) is the key to increasing volume.
"
Ha yini swifaniso swa le thelevhixini swi tsemiwile ematlhelo hinkwawo?,"The correct answer is **B: Leswaku xifaniso xi tala eka xikirini hinkwaxo**.

The passage explicitly states that ""hinkwaswo leswi u swi vonaka eka TV a swi tsemiwile eka mindzilakana, ehenhla, ehansi ni le matlhelweni. Leswi swi endleriwa ku tiyisisa leswaku xifaniso xi tata xikirini hinkwaxo.""
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiphiqo swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi un’wana a nga langutanaka na swona loko a hundzula muvhi yi va fomati ya DVD?","The correct answer is **B: Marito lama hlamuselaka vhidiyo lama nga tsemiwa xiphemu**.

The passage explicitly states that when converting a movie to DVD, the borders can be cut off, and if subtitles are near the bottom of the screen, they may not be fully visible.  Options A, C, and D are the opposite of what the passage describes as the problem.
"
A yi ri kwihi ndhawu leyi laha masocha ya le Britain a ma rindza kona?,"The correct answer is **C: Bordentown**.

The passage states that John Cadwalder was to initiate a diversionary attack on the British garrison *in Bordentown*. The other locations were targets or areas related to the American attacks, not specifically where the British were garrisoned.
"
A ku ri nsayino wa mani lowu a wu ri eka mpfampfarhuto lowu tsariweke hi voko?,"The correct answer is **D: Charles Thomson**.

The passage states: ""mpfampfarhuto lowu tsariweke hi voko lowu sayiniweke hi Murhangeri wa Khongresi John Hancock swin’we ni Matsalana Charles Thompson wu yisiwe eka vhengele ro kandziyisa.""
"
"Eka tindhawu leti landzelaka, hi le kwihi laha Dunlap broadside yi nga fika ro hetelela?","Based on the passage, the Dunlap broadside reached the following locations in this order:

1.  Dunlap's printing shop
2.  Independence Hall
3.  New York
4.  London

Therefore, the last place it reached among the options is **C: E Landhani (London)**.
"
Masocha ya Mukolonele Stark a ma ri kwihi?,"The correct answer is **A: Emakumu ya le n’walungwini, etlhelo ka fenisi**.

The passage states ""Vavanuna va Stark va teke tlhelo ra fenisi en’walungu ka mahetelelo ya ndhawu ya vakholonisi."" This directly translates to Stark's men taking the northern side of the fence at the end of the colonist's position.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, a ku ri rini loko vavanuna va Stark va engetela fenisi ya vona?","The correct answer is **C: Loko ku tlakuka ka mati ya le lwandle ku ye ehansi**.

The passage states: ""Loko ku tlakuka ka mati ya lwandle ku ye ehansi ku siye vangwa eMystic River en’walungu-vuxa bya peninsula, hi xihatla va engetele fenisi hi khumbi ro koma ra ribye en’walungwini ri helela emakumu ka mati eribuweni leritsongo."" This directly indicates that they extended the fence after the tide went out and exposed a gap.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i nkarhi wihi eka leyi landzelaka laha a ku ri nguva wa madzolonga ngopfu le Chayina?","The correct answer is **D: Nguva wa Mimfumo Minharhu**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Nkarhi wa Mifumo Minharhu i un’wana wa minkarhi lowu halateke ngati yo tala swinene eka matimu ya Chayina ya khale..."" (The Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history...)
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini lexi nga ntiyiso hi kholoni ya vusokobyi loko byi nghena eka xiyenge xa nomadikhi?","The correct answer is **B: Swa kudya a swi kumeki ngopfu**.

The passage states, ""Kholoni yi sungula xiyenge xa nomadikhi loko swa kudya swi nga kumeki ngopfu."" This directly supports option B. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi leswi hlamuselaka kahle mikhuva ya ku endla ndhawu yo tshama ya kholoni ya vusokobyi hi nkarhi wa xiyenge xa nomadikhi?","The correct answer is **C: Byi cinca tindhawu to tshama siku ni siku**

The passage states: ""Eka xiyenge lexi, koloni yi endla tindhawu ta ku tshama bya swi nkadyana leti cinciwaka masiku hinkwawo.""  This directly translates to ""In this phase, the colony makes temporary shelters that are changed daily."" Therefore, option C is the only one that accurately reflects the text.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga ta ya emahlweni hambi ku ri ni swivangelo swa ntumbuluko?,"The passage says: ""Leswi lawuraka ku endleka ka swilo swa ntumbuluko hi nkarhi wa swona swa ti endlekela naswona swi ta ku ya mahlweni hi ku ti endlekelela hambiloko ku nga swilo leswi swi yi rhumaka ku endla tano."" This implies that natural processes themselves will continue to occur even without external influences.

Option B, ""Mafambiselo ya ntumbuluko"" (Natural processes), is the best answer.  The passage states these processes will continue even without something ""forcing"" them to.

The other options are too specific or don't accurately reflect the passage's meaning:

*   A: Fambiselo ra ntumbuluko ra le ndzeni ka mirhi (Natural processes inside plants) - Too specific.
*   C: Minkarhi ya swilo swa ntumbuluko (Times of natural things) - Doesn't make sense in this context.
*   D: Mafambiselo ya ntumbuluko lama phindha-phindhaka (Natural processes that repeat) - Also too specific, and repetition is not the key element being discussed.

Therefore, the answer is **B**.
"
I rito rihi leri hlamuselaka vanhu lava kombisaka ku hambana ka xitekela xo karhi?,"The correct answer is **D: Polimofiki**

The passage states, ""Loko vanhu va kombisa ku hambana ko hlayanyana eka xilo xo karhi, va yi polimofiki,"" which translates to ""If individuals show a lot of variation in a trait, they are polymorphic.""
"
Eka leswi landzelaka i rihi rito leri faneleke ra swivumbiwa leswi tshamaka endhawini yo karhi?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is:

**B: Nhlengeletano ya swivumbiwa**

The passage states: ""Nhlayo ya ku tshama yi nhlengeletano ya swivumbiwa ya muxaka w’unwana eka ndhawu yo karhi ya ntumbuluko."" This directly defines the term for a group of organisms of one type living in a natural area as ""nhlengeletano ya swivumbiwa.""
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga riki xikombiso xa leswi nga endliwa tanihi vupfhumba lebyi seketeriweke eka ntumbuluko?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku vhakela muziyamu ya sayense**.

Here's why:

*   **Ecotourism (vupfhumba lebyi seketiriweke eka ntumbuluko)** focuses on experiencing and learning about the natural environment. The passage describes activities like hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and studying ecosystems in parks and nature reserves.

*   Options A, B, and D all directly involve interacting with nature:
    *   **A: Ku khandziya tintshava ku ya eka boboma ra mati** (Hiking to a waterfall) involves a natural landscape.
    *   **B: Ku teka swinepe swa swiluva swa le khwathini** (Taking photos of forest flowers) directly interacts with plant life.
    *   **D: Ku phasa tinhlampfi** (Fishing) involves aquatic wildlife.

*   **C: Ku vhakela muziyamu ya sayense** (Visiting a science museum) is typically an indoor activity that, while educational, doesn't inherently involve direct interaction with the natural environment. Although a science museum might contain displays relating to the natural world, it is not nature itself, so it is not Ecotourism.

Therefore, visiting a science museum is the activity that least fits the definition of ecotourism provided in the passage."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga xisekelo xa fambiselo ra swilo leswi fambisaka vanhu?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Timovha ta vanhu (Public transportation vehicles/Cars)**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that ""vanhu hinkwavo va seketela swilo swa ku fambisa swa mimovha ya vanhu"" which translates to ""everyone relies on public transportation vehicles/cars.""
*   The rest of the passage builds upon the dependence on cars and its impact (traffic, carbon emissions).

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Tindhawu ta ntirho (Workplaces):** While workplaces are mentioned, they're the *destination* for the transportation system, not the foundation of it.
*   **C: Ndhawu leyi ku tshamaka swivumbiwa leyi tiyeke (Stable environment):** The passage argues that the current transportation system is *destabilizing* the environment, not relying on its stability.
*   **D: Ku ti endlekela ka vanhu (Human development):** Human development is impacted by the instability, but is not the underlying foundation of the transportation system.

Therefore, the most accurate answer, according to the passage, is B."
Swilo leswi rhendzeleke nyutliliya ti ni muxaka wihi wa chaji?,"The correct answer is **C: Chaji ya negethivhi**.

The passage states: ""T elekitironi ti na negetivhi elektiriki chaji."" Electrons are the particles that orbit the nucleus.
"
Nyutliliya yi endliwe hi swilo swihi?,"The correct answer is **A: Tiporotoni ni tinyuturoni**

The passage explicitly states: ""Nyutliliya I na swilo swimbirhi - tinyuturoni na tiporotoni.""
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, eka leswi landzelaka i yini xikombiso xa tinomboro leti tirhisiwaka?","Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, tikhompyutha ti tirhisa tinomboro timbirhi ntsena: 0 na 1.  Hikokwalaho, xikombiso xa tinomboro leti tirhisiwaka xi fanele ku va na 0s na 1s ntsena.

*   **A: 1010** yi ni 0s na 1s ntsena.
*   **B: 12001** yi ni 2, leyi nga riki 0 kumbe 1.
*   **C: 10010** yi ni 0s na 1s ntsena.
*   **D: 110101** yi ni 0s na 1s ntsena.

Leswi swi vulaka leswaku A, C, na D hinkwaswo swi nga va swikombiso swa tinomboro leti tirhisiwaka. Hambiswiritano, xivutiso xi kombisa leswaku hi fanele hi hlawula nhlamulo yin'we ntsena. Tanihi leswi nhlamulo A yi nga tlula tin'wana hi vukulu, hi nga yi hlawula tanihi nhlamulo leyi nga kahle eka leswi nga kona.

Kutani, nhlamulo leyi lulameke hi **A: 1010**.

It is important to note that C and D are also valid binary numbers, but without further context, A is the most straightforward answer."
Tinomboro leti tirhisiwaka nakambe ti vitaniwa yini?,"The correct answer is **A: Tibiti**.

The passage states: ""...naswona tinomborho leti ku vuriwa leswaku i ti nomborho lebyi tirhisiwaka - kumbe tibiti, loko hi tirhisa ririmi ra tikhompyutha.""
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga vuriwangiki eka ndzimana tanihi ku vuyeriwa ka ku tsala tibulogo ta machudeni?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku hunguteka ka ku solasoriwa hi machudeni man’wana**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Ku antswa ka mapeletelo ni matsalelo:** The passage explicitly states that students improve their writing to avoid criticism, thus improving spelling and grammar.
*   **C: Ku hlalmusela ndhawu ya vona:** The passage says, ""machudeni va nga hlamusela ndhawu ya vona loko ku langutiwe matsalelo ya van’wana ni langutelo ra vona eka timhaka to karhi"" which means students can explain their views.
*   **D: Khuthaza machudeni ku dyondza ni loko va nga ri exikolweni:** The passage mentions that blogging ""khuthaza machudeni dyondza ni loko va nga ri exikolweni"" meaning it encourages students to learn even when they are not at school.

Option B is incorrect because the passage doesn't state that there is a reduction of criticism from other students. It only mentions that students avoid criticism in order to improve their writing."
I yini eka swiyenge leswi landzelaka swa ku tsala tibulogo leswi nga tekiwa tanihi ku khuthaza machudeni ku antswisa vuswikoti byo tsala?,"The best answer is **B: Mboyamelo wa ku papalata ku solasoriwa**

Here's why:

*   **P states:** ""Leswi machudeni minkarhi yo tala va vahlaleri va nkoka, loyi a tsalaka bulogo u tirhela ku antswisa matsalelo leswaku a papalata ku solasoriwa."" This directly links the desire to avoid criticism with improving writing skills.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: Ku hlamula swilo swa le ka inthanete nkarhi ni nkarhi** The passage mentions responding to things online helps students formulate their own positions but doesn't explicitly connect it to improving general writing *skills*. It's more about critical thinking.
*   **C: Ku endla vahlaleri va tshama va tsakela** While keeping readers engaged is a good practice, the passage states: ""Ku buloga swi kucetela moya wo tirhisana, no khuthaza machudeni dyondza ni loko va nga ri exikolweni.""
*   **D: Xilaveko xa moya wo tirhisana** The need for collaboration is mentioned in the text, but it doesn't directly translate to improving writing skills."
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga riki vuyelo bya ku vulavurisana loku nga humeleriki hi nkarhi wun’we eka machudeni? ,"Nhlamulo leyi faneleke i **A: Ku tirhisiwa ka inthanete tanihi xitirhisiwa.**

Xivangelo:

Hambiloko inthanete na World Wide Web swi pfuneta eka ku vulavurisana loku nga humeleriki hi nkarhi wun’we, **ku tirhisiwa ka inthanete hi xoxe a hi vuyelo bya ku vulavurisana loku nga humeleriki hi nkarhi wun’we.** Inthanete i xitirhisiwa lexi tirhisiwaka ku endla leswaku ku vulavurisana ku humelela, kambe a hi vuyelo bya kona.

Swihlawulekisi leswin’wana hinkwaswo swi boxiwa tanihi swivuyelo swa ku vulavurisana loku nga humeleriki hi nkarhi wun’we eka xitshuriwa:

*   **B: Ku vulavula ni vadyondzisi hi nkarhi un’wana ni un’wana:** Xitshuriwa xi vula leswaku vadyondzi va nga rhumela swivutiso eka vadyondzisi nkarhi wun’wana ni wun’wana.
*   **C: Matirhelo lama olovaka:** Xitshuriwa xi vula leswaku ku na swipemelo switsongo swa nkarhi leswi nyikaka matirhelo lama olovaka.
*   **D: Vulawuri bya rivilo:** Xitshuriwa xi vula leswaku swi pfumelela machudeni leswaku ma tirha hi rivilo ra wona vini va tlhela va lawula rivilo ra vuxokoxoko bya madyondziselo."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka swiyenge leswi landzelaka swa ku vulavurisana loku nga humeleriki hi nkarhi un’we leyi nga riki yo olova eka machudeni?","Based on the paragraph, the correct answer is **D: Ku tirhisiwa ka inthanete**.

The paragraph states the following benefits of asynchronous communication:

*   Allows students to work at their own pace (**A: Rivilo ra ku dyondza**)
*   Control the pace of instructional material (**C: Voxokoxoko bya madyondziselo**)
*   Fewer time constraints which offers flexible operation (**B: Tiawara ta ku tirha**)
*   Using the internet and WWW allows students to access information at any time.

The internet usage itself isn't described as providing flexibility for students, but rather as a tool that enables the other benefits listed. Therefore, internet access is not one of the flexible parts according to the paragraph.
"
I yini leswi nga vuriwangiki eka ndzimana tanihi leswi munhu a nga swi katsakanya ni xigodlo xa ndhavuko xa le ka malembexikarhi?,"The correct answer is **C: Vunjhinga** (Engineering).

Here's why:

*   **A: Emigodini ya vabohiwa (In prison mines):** The passage mentions ""the smell of dread from the prison mines.""
*   **B: Lava lwaka va khandziye tihanci (Warriors on horseback):** The passage mentions ""images of knights on horseback.""
*   **D: Tinhenha (Heroes):** The passage mentions ""the chivalry of King Arthur.""

*   **C: Vunjhinga (Engineering):** While the passage asks *how* castles were made and built, it does not discuss ""vunjhinga,"" which is engineering itself."
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga si vuriwa eka ndzimana tanihi minun’hwelo kumbe mimpfumawulo leyi twiwaka emarhumbini ya xigodlo?,"The correct answer is **C: Swakudya swa vanhu vo tala**

The passage mentions the following sounds and smells one might imagine:

*   Sounds of battles
*   Sound of horses' hooves on cobblestones
*   Smell of fear emanating from the dungeons

""Swakudya swa vanhu vo tala"" (large feasts) are mentioned only as a concept inspired by medieval castles, not as a smell or sound one would experience in the ruins."
I yihi eka leti landzelaka leyi nga nhlamuselo ya kahle ya Kirby Muxloe Castle?,"The best answer is **C: Ku akiwa ka khokholo a ku nga faneli nkarhi wolowo (The building of the castle was not appropriate for the time)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** That during the time Kirby Muxloe Castle was built, the country was at peace. The need was for defense against small bands of roving raiders, not a large, fortified castle. This implies that building such a large, defensive structure was not really necessary or suited to the actual threats of the time.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Makhumbi yo anama ya khokholo a ma komberiwe hi Hosi Hastings (The wide walls of the castle were requested by Lord Hastings):** While Lord Hastings started construction, the passage implies the need for these large walls wasn't really there, making the construction unnecessary.
    * **B: A ku laveka marhangu lamatsongo hikwalaho ka ku rhula ka tiko hi nkarhi wa ku akiwa (Small walls were needed because of the peace in the country during construction):** This is the opposite of what was built, even if the need was that way.
    * **D: A ri akiwa ku sivela nhlaselo lowu nga lunghiseleriwa (It was being built to prevent a well-prepared attack):** The passage argues against this, claiming that large-scale attacks weren't the primary concern.
"
I swiphemu swihi swa ku akiwa eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga ta tekiwa swi nga faneleki Kirby Muxloe Castle enkarhini lowu nga hlamuseriwa eka ndzimana?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku akiwa loku nga ta sivela minhlaselo**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that while Kirby Muxloe Castle had features such as large windows and moats, these would not be adequate to resist a determined attack. This implies that a fortress designed to effectively prevent attacks would be inappropriate for the circumstances described in the passage.
*   **A, C, and D:** The passage explicitly mentions large windows and moats as features of Kirby Muxloe Castle. The passage states it was built during a time of relative peace when defense against only small groups was needed. These would have been adequate features."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga ta va vuyelo lebyikulu eka munhu wa ku tsutsuma loyi a nga lunghiselela nkarhi lowu taka wa ku tsutsuma?","The correct answer is **D: Ku tirhisa ndhawu ya vutiolori ku endla vutiolori bya miri wa le henhla**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions that ""Ku tsutsumanyana eka ti ndhawu ta ntumbuluko hi nkarhi wa xixika, swin’we ni ku endla vutiolori bya miri wa le henhla, hi yona ndlela ya ku lunghiselela nkarhi wa ku tsutsuma."" which translates to ""Running slowly in nature during the winter, along with upper body workouts, is the way to prepare for the running season."" The only option that touches on one of these elements is D."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka swa nkoka ngopfu eka munhu loyi a tsutsuma hafu ya mayile ya xiyimo lexi tlakukeke?","The correct answer is **B: Ku dyondza ku tiyisela ku tlula rivilo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...kambe ku tiyisela ku fanele ku dyondziwa eka swilo hinkwaswo."" This means endurance is more important than speed for a half-mile run. Therefore, the answer is B.
"
"Eka munhu wa ku tsutsuma, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga ta fikeleriwa ntsena hi ku dya kahle?","Based on the text, the correct answer is **A: Ku antswa ka vuswikoti bya ku tsutsuma**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ku dya kahle ntsena a ku nge endli munhu a tsutsume kahle ngopfu, kambe ku yi khumba ngopfu vuswikoti bya ku tsutsuma kahle eka vatsutsumi la vantshwa."" This means that eating well *does* improve running ability, but it doesn't make you an elite runner on its own.

Let's look at the other options:

* **B: Ku tsakela hi ndlela leyi engetelekeleke:** The passage mentions that eating well, along with other factors, contributes to increased enjoyment. It's not solely from eating well.
* **C: Vuswikoti bya ku tsutsuma bya xiyimo xa le henhla:** The passage explicitly states that eating well alone *won't* make someone a top-level runner.
* **D: Ku tshama u tiyerile hi ndlela leyinene:** The passage lists this as a separate factor that helps runners, distinct from just eating well.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi ku nga riki ndlela leyi nga ringanyetiwa ya vatsutsumi lavantshwa leswaku va tsakela ntlango wa vona hi laha ku engetelekeke?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Va tshama va antswisa vuswikoti bya ku tsutsuma byi va bya xiyimo xa le henhla**.

The passage mentions that eating well, staying hydrated, understanding different ways to supplement, and staying properly conditioned can help young runners improve their running and *enjoy the sport more*.  It doesn't suggest that constantly striving to improve to an elite level is necessary for increased enjoyment. The focus is on the holistic approach of nutrition, hydration, and conditioning to enhance both performance and enjoyment.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ha yini mutsutsumi wa ndhawu leyi nga lehanga naswona yi nga komanga a nga xavaka xitirhisiwa lexi durhaka ngopfu?","The correct answer is **A: I leswi va swi lavaka**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""Vatsutsumi va nga twa nga ku va hlawula switirhisiwa hambiloko swi nga pfuni nchumu."" This directly implies that runners might choose equipment simply because they desire it, even if it doesn't improve performance. The passage highlights that they may not need it to run, and it may not even help them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Xi nga va pfuna:** The passage mentions that the equipment ""swi yi cinca ka ntsongo kumbe swi nga yi cinci ndlela leyi munhu a tsutsu ma ha yona"" meaning it may help slightly, or not at all.
*   **C: Xi ta cinca ndlela leyi va nga vatsutsuma ha yona:** The passage explicitly states that the equipment might *not* change how they run.
*   **D: Swi tele swilo leswi nga riki ntiyiso leswi vuriwaka hi xitirhisiwa lexi nga durhiki:** This option is about why the price is affordable."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ku laveka yini leswaku u tsutsuma eka ndhawu leyi nga lehanga naswona yi nga komanga?","The correct answer is **C: Switirhisiwa leswitsongo ngopfu** (Very little equipment).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states ""...i ntlango lowu nga durhiki..."" which translates to ""...it's an inexpensive sport..."". This means it doesn't require ""Mali yo tala"" (A lot of money) or ""Switirhisiwa swo tala"" (Lots of equipment).

* The passage focuses on the *misconceptions* around equipment, not the need for a thriving sports culture, eliminating option B.

* The passage implies the need for minimal equipment and suggests that even unnecessary equipment is a source of choice for runners. It emphasizes that equipment, while often hyped, is not essential and has little impact on running.
"
I mani loyi a nga kuma nuclear magnetic resonance? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch na Purcell**.

The passage clearly states: ""MRI yi sekeriwe eka swiendlakalo leswi vonakaka leswi vuriwaka nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), leyi kumiweke hi va 1930 hi Felix Bloch (a tirha eYunivhesithi ya Stanford) na Edward Purcell (ku suka eYunivhesithi ya Harvard).""
"
Hi lembe rihi laha ku nyikeriweke patente ya ku sungula medical imaging resonance? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

The passage states ""Malembe ya mune endzhaku ka kwalaho u nyikiwe patente, leyi yi veke yo sungula ku humesiwa eka dyondzo ya MRI"" after mentioning Raymond Damadian finding the basis for MRI in 1970. Four years after 1970 is 1974.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini leswi vanhu va faneleke va swi twisisa ngopfu leswaku va kota ku twisisa swiendlo swa vanhu van’wana?","The correct answer is **B: Leswi va swi lavaka**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Eka swilo leswi hinkwaswo, ku twisisa leswi vanhu va swi lavaka i swa nkoka ngopfu. Swi hi pfumelela ku tlhantlha swiendlo swo tala."" (Of all these things, understanding what people want is the most important. It allows us to unravel many actions.)
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ku twisisa leswi va swi lavaka ku pfuna vanhu leswaku va endla yini?","The correct answer is **A: Ku susa ku nga tiyiseki hi swiendlo**.

The passage states that understanding what people want allows us to ""tlhantlha swiendlo swo tala"" (resolve many actions). This means that understanding someone's desires helps us to clarify and remove uncertainty about their behavior. The example given illustrates this directly: Knowing *why* someone is breaking a car window (desire to steal vs. desire to unlock their own car) removes the uncertainty and allows for a more accurate interpretation of their actions.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga nkatsakanyo lowu kongomeke hi xikongomelo-nkulu xa AI?","Based on the passage, the most accurate summary of AI's primary goal is:

**D: Ku endla mintirho (To perform tasks)**

Here's why:

The passage highlights that AI research aims to create machines that can perform tasks requiring intelligent behavior. The other options (A, B, and C) are simply examples of specific tasks AI can perform.  The *core goal* is to create systems capable of *doing* things that normally require human intelligence.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi ko tala swi fambisiwaka ni AI?","The passage states that AI research includes ""vuswikoti by hlamula swivutiso swa vaxavi, hambi kuri ku vona laha ku tsariweke hi voka, rito ni xikandza"" and ""ku lawula, ku hlela na ku longoloxa"". Thus, options A, B, and D are all explicitly mentioned as being associated with AI.

However, the question asks for what is ""ko tala swi fambisiwaka ni AI"" which translates to what is ""most commonly associated with AI"".

*   **A: Vuswikoti byo hlamula swivutiswo swa vaxavi (The ability to answer customer questions):** This is a common application of AI, especially with chatbots and virtual assistants.
*   **B: Ku hlela ni ku longoloxa (Controlling and planning):** This is also a common application, especially in areas like logistics, scheduling, and manufacturing.
*   **C: Sayense ya switori swo anakanyiwa (Science fiction):** While AI is a frequent topic in science fiction, it's not something ""handled"" *by* AI itself. The passage mentions a connection between AI and science fiction, but not in the context of AI performing science fiction.
*   **D: Ku vona laha ku tsariweke hi voko (Being able to see where it is written by hand):** This is handwriting recognition, which is also a common application of AI.

Given the general context of AI applications, all options, A, B, and D are valid. However, from the perspective of the ndzimana (passage), the passage clearly states,  ""Swikombiso swi katsa ku lawula, ku hlela na ku longoloxa, vuswikoti by hlamula swivutiso swa vaxavi, hambi kuri ku vona laha ku tsariweke hi voka, rito ni xikandza."". It mentions all these options as examples. Therefore, without specific context prioritizing one application over the others in the given passage, all options A, B, and D are acceptable.

However, in a more general sense of the term ""commonly"" and the examples listed, since options A, B, and D, are all commonly associated with AI as explicitly mentioned as applications or capabilities within the passage, I would select option A, B, or D. Since all three are valid based on the information provided in the text.

Without further context or clarification, it is difficult to make a choice. All the options related to AI are mentioned in the text, as examples of what AI research includes.

Let's assume the intention is to choose one from the list.
**Based on the options provided and the passage, any of A, B, or D, can be chosen**
The correct answer is most likely **A, B, or D.**"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga vuswikoti bya munhu loyi a nga ni miehleketo yo lulamisa swiphiqo leyi hlanganisaka mavonelo yo hambana kumbe swiyenge swo karhi ku kuma xitshunxo?","Based on the paragraph, the correct answer is **D: Va swi kota ku nhlokohata muxaka wa miehleketo.**

The passage explicitly states: ""Vanhu lava nga ni miehleketo ya muxaka lowu va anakanya hi vutlhari, va swi kota ku nhlokohata muxaka ma miehleketo, ku lulamisa swiphiqo ni ku tirha hi swikambelo swa sayense.""

The passage explicitly states that ""Yinhla ya nkoka swinene ya miehleketo leyi hileswaku: ku hava nhlamulo yin’we leyi kongomeke"" (The most important point of this type of thinking is that: there is no single correct answer). Option A directly contradicts this, therefore it is NOT a characteristic of deep thinking.

The passage mentions rivilo (speed), ku kumisisa mintiyiso (finding facts), and ku hlengeleta rungula (gathering information) as characteristics, so options C and D are characteristics. Option B ""ku teka nkarhi"" (taking time) can be inferred as the passage mentioned rivilo, meaning not taking your time would not be a characteristic."

I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga va swa nkoka ngopfu hikwalaho ka Ndzhundzunuko? ,"The passage states that the Reformation brought about a ""great change in the way knowledge is learned and disseminated."" Dissemination is a synonym for distribution or spreading. Therefore, the most important aspect of the Reformation according to the passage is the **spread of knowledge**.

So the correct answer is **B: Ku hangalasiwa ka vutivi** (The distribution of knowledge).
"
"Hikwalaho ka Ndzhundzunuko, a ku kandziyisiwa yini katsongo eka leswi landzelaka?","The answer is **A: Ku tsundzuka ka munhu**.

The passage states: ""A ka ha ri ni ntshikelelo eka ku tsundzuka ka munhu..."" which translates to ""There is no longer pressure on human memory..."" after the Revolution.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga kombiki nhlohlotelo wa ku tirhisa inthanete eka vuxaka lebyi hambetaka?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku tshama u vulavurisana ni ndyangu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions ""vuxaka lebyi hambetaka"" (continuing relationships) as a factor influencing internet use.

*   Option B, ""Ku tshama u vulavurisana ni ndyangu"" (Staying in touch with family), directly relates to maintaining and continuing existing relationships.

The other options are less directly related to *continuing* relationships:

*   A: ""Ku hlangana hi mabindzu"" (Meeting for business) - More about professional interaction.
*   C: ""Ku lavisisa hi ku teka maendzo"" (Searching for travel deals) - unrelated.
*   D: ""Ku hlangana ni vanhu lavantshwa"" (Meeting new people) - Focuses on *new* relationships, not continuing existing ones."
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga kombiki nhlohlotelo wa ku tirhisa inthanete eka ku katseka ka munhu?,"The answer is **B: Ku tsala leswi u swi lavaka eka mbulavurisano wa le ka inthanete**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage highlights ""personal involvement"" and ""ongoing relationships"" as motivations for Internet use.** Participating in online discussions directly involves a person and fosters potential relationships with other participants.
*   The other options (A, C, and D) are tasks or information searches, which might be useful but don't necessarily imply the same level of personal engagement or relationship-building as actively participating in a discussion."
Yuropa ya vupela-dyambu yi tshike rini ku kuceteriwa ngopfu ivi yi sungula ku endla xitayela xa yona?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku ya emakumu ya Malembe ya le Xikarhi**.

The passage states, ""Ku ya emakumu ya Malembe ya le Xikarhi Yuropa vupela-dyambu yi sungule ku endla xitayela xa yona."" This directly answers the question of when Western Europe started developing its own style.
"
Ku tirhisa tikunupu ku boha swiambalo a ku ri vuyelo bya yini? ,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is:

**C: Tinyimpi ta nkutsulo**

The text states, ""Wun’wani wa nhluvuko lowukulu wa nkarhi wa lowo hi xi vangelo xa tinyimpi ta nkutsulo vanhu va sungule ku tirhisa tikunupu ku boha swiambalo."" This directly links the use of buttons to the Crusades (tinyimpi ta nkutsulo).
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga tekiwa tanihi ntlhantlho wa nkarhi wo leha eka swiphiqo swa mbango?","The correct answer is **C: Ku kuma rimitsu ra swiphiqo.**

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""loko hi nga lavi ntlhantlho wa xinkadyana, hi fanele hi kuma rimitsu ra swiphiqo, naswona hi fanele hi ti tsuvula."" This directly translates to ""if we don't want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and uproot them.""

Let's look at why the other options are not the best answers:

* **A: Ku yirisa eka hi mahanyelo ya vulovolovo ya vanhu (Restricting people's luxurious lifestyle):** While the passage mentions lifestyle as a contributing factor, it doesn't suggest restricting it as *the* long-term solution.
* **B: Ku yima ni lava lwelaka ku sirheleriwa ka mbango (Standing with environmental protectors):** This is a good thing to do, but the passage frames it as more of a short-term or supportive measure, not the fundamental solution.
* **D: Ku va vaseketeri va mbango (Being environmental supporters):** Similar to option B, this is helpful but doesn't address the underlying cause of the problems.

Therefore, finding the root cause (rimitsu ra swiphiqo) is presented as the key to a lasting solution.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i ntlhantlho wihi eka leyi landzelaka lowu nga riki vutshunguri byo languta swikombiso swa swiphiqo swa mbango?","The correct answer is **B: Ku tsuvula rimitsu ra swiphiqo**.

Here's why:

*   **P** argues that actions like living eco-friendly, supporting environmentalists, and being environmental advocates are like treating symptoms, not the root cause.
*   **B: Ku tsuvula rimitsu ra swiphiqo (To uproot the root of the problems)** directly addresses the need to find and eliminate the core issues, which is presented as the opposite of merely treating symptoms.
*   Options **A, C, and D** are described in the first sentence of **P** as being like a treatment that only targets symptoms, not the root cause of the problem.
Therefore, the only option that wouldn't be like ""treating symptoms"" is **B**."
I tiko rihi laha a ku ri ni nyimpi ya masungulo le Yuropa leyi xiphiqo xa yona a xi fambisana ni ku lawula vuhosi ku nga ri xa vukhongeri?,"The correct answer is **D: E Spaniya**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Nyimpi ya Xikhundlha xa ku Fuma ya Spaniya a ku ri masungulo ya nyimpi yo sungula leyi mhaka leyikulu ya yona a ku ri vulawuri lebyi pimiweke."" (The War of Spanish Succession was the beginning of the first war where the main issue was balance of power.)
"
I nyimpi yihi leyi nkarhi un’wana yi hlamuseriwaka tanihi ‘nyimpi ya vukhongeri’ yo hetelela?,"The correct answer is **A: Nyimpi ya Malembe ya Makumenharhu**.

The passage states: ""Hikwalaho, Nyimpi ya Malembe ya Makumenharhu a ku tava nyimpi yo hetelela leyi a yi ta vitaniwa hi leswaku i ya vukhongeri.""
"
I swiyenge swihi eka leswi landzelaka swa Kereke ya Khatholiki leswi nga si kambisisiwa?,"The passage states that the power and wealth of the Catholic Church, and whether its fundamental beliefs were being met, were questioned. Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **D: Xana vupfumeri bya xisekelo bya Kereke a byi fikeleriwa**

Options A and C are also mentioned in the passage.

Option B is incorrect, as the passage doesn't mention changing the basic beliefs of the religion, but instead whether those beliefs were being upheld."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mani loyi a nga dlayiwa le Versailles?","The correct answer is **D: Murindzi**

The passage states: ""Hi nkarhi un’wana xirho xa ntshungu u dziwite nhloko ya murindzi wa le vuhosini loyi a nga dlayiwa a Versailles emahlweni ka Nkosikazi yo chuha."" This translates to: ""At one point a member of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.""
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi swi nga sindzisiwaka eka Hosi ni Nkosikazi hi ntshungu?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku pfula mafasitere ya kalichi ya vona**.

The passage explicitly states that the crowd *sindzisi* (forced) the King and Queen to open the windows of their carriage. The other options are events that happened, but not things the crowd specifically *forced* them to do at that moment.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi a ku nga si vuyelo bya nyimpi ya Britain yo kala swipimelo ya swikepe?,"The passage states: ""Rhengu rero ri ti kombe ri tirha, hi ku sivela switirhisiwa swa nkoka swa masocha ni vaaki...Britain yi cele mati ya matiko hinkwawo ku sivela swikepe hambi swi ri swihi ku nghena eka swiphemu hinkwaswo swa lwandle-nkulu, leswi a swi vangela khombo ni le swikepeni swa vukala-tlhelo. Tanihi loko a ku nga endliwanga swo xiyeka hi rhengu leri, Jarimani yi rindzele leswaku ku endleka leswi fanaka hi nyimpi ya yona yo kala swipimelo ya swikepe swa le hansi ka mati.""

Based on this information:
* **A: Ku navela ka Jarimani ku tirhisa rhengu ra nyimpi leri fanaka** - This is a direct consequence mentioned in the last sentence.
* **B: Ku vangela khombo ni le swikepeni swa vukala-tlhelo** - This is explicitly stated in the passage.
* **D: Ku sivela switirhisiwa swa nkoka** - This is the stated purpose and effect of the blockade.

The only option NOT explicitly mentioned as a direct result is:

* **C: Ku cinca nawu lowu amukeriwaka hi vanhu hinkwawo** - While the passage *implies* that the blockade violated international law, it doesn't say the law *changed*.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C**.
"
I swiga swihi leswi nga hlamuseriki kahle ku sivela ka Britain swikepe swa Jarimani?,"The correct answer is **C: Yi kavanyete ku nghena ka switirhisiwa swa Jarimani**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""...hi ku sivela switirhisiwa swa nkoka swa masocha ni vaaki..."" This directly describes the impact of the blockade, so C is NOT a mischaracterization.
*   **The passage states:** ""...ku sivela loku a ku tlula nawu lowu amukelekaka hi vanhu hinkwavo..."" This says the blockade violated international law, so A is NOT a mischaracterization.
*   **The passage states:** ""...Jarimani yi rindzele leswaku ku endleka leswi fanaka hi nyimpi ya yona yo kala swipimelo ya swikepe swa le hansi ka mati."" This implies the blockade led to Germany's unrestricted submarine warfare, so B is NOT a mischaracterization.
*   **The passage states:** ""...leswi a swi vangela khombo ni le swikepeni swa vukala-tlhelo."" This says the blockade endangered neutral ships, so D is NOT a mischaracterization.

Therefore, there is nothing in the passage that could be considered a mischaracterization."

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, vanhu lava a va nghenelela eka swilo leswi endliwaka va lava ku seketeriwa hi ndlela leyi engetelekeke hikwalaho ka yini?","The correct answer is **A: Miehleketo leyi nga riki kahle ya ku twa ku vava**.

The passage states: ""Vanhu lava ava nghenelela eka swilo leswi endliwaka a va lava ku seketeriwa hi ndlela leyi engeteleke eka ndlela leti a ava twa u vava ha yona leswaku va swi kota ku hambanisa ku vava ka vuvabyi na ku nga titwi kahle loko va famba famba.""

This translates to: ""People participating in the activities needed additional support to manage their pain levels so they could differentiate between pain caused by the condition and discomfort from movement.""

The reason they need extra support is because their *perception* of pain (Miehleketoleyi nga riki kahle ya ku twa ku vava) is exacerbated by anxiety and psychological distress. They are not just feeling the physical pain, but also mental distress which amplifies the pain experience.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, fensing yi tlangiwa njhani?","The correct answer is **D: Wu tlangiwa hi vanhu vambirhi**.

The passage states ""Hakanyingi ntlangu lowu wu tlangiwa hi vanhu vambirhi,mutlangi lowun’wana a lwa ni mutlangi lowun’wana."" which directly translates to ""Usually this game is played by two people, one player fighting the other player.""  The other options describe where it's played, not how it's played.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga ta komba ngopfu leswaku ku ni chefu leyi ngheneke endzeni?","The correct answer is **D: Khontayina ya mirhi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Xikombiso lexikulu xa chefu leyi ngheneke endzeni ku nga va khontayina leyi pfulekeke ya mirhi kumbe ti khemikhali ta le kaya leti nga ni chefu."" (""A big example of internal poisoning is an open container of medicine or poisonous household chemicals."")

The other options, while potentially related to poisoning, are less direct and conclusive than finding a container of poison. Option B - Ku hlanta ni ku dzuka nyuku (vomiting and sweating) are signs that may be related to poison, however they are not direct signs like option D."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini goza ra ku sungula leri faneleke ra ku kamba munhu loyi a kumeke khombo?","Based on the passage, the first step is to:

**A: Kambisisa eka ndhawu ya khombo** (Assess the scene of the accident)

The passage explicitly states: ""Ku Kamba munhu loyi a kumeke khombo, u fanele u **rhanga hi ku kambisisa eka ndhawu leyi ya khombo** leswaku u tiyiseka hi ku hlayiseka"" (When examining someone who has had an accident, you must **first assess the scene of the accident** to ensure safety).
"
I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga kombiki hi ku kongoma ndlela ya ku kamba munhu loyi a kumeke khombo?,"The correct answers are **B, C, and D.**

Here's why:

*   **B: Kambisisa ndhawu ya khombo u nga si ya eka munhu loyi a kumeke khombo** This is a direct instruction from the passage: ""U fanele u rhanga hi ku kambisisa eka ndhawu leyi ya khombo leswaku u tiyiseka hi ku hlayiseka"" (You must first examine the accident scene to ensure safety).

*   **C: Xiya ku yima ka munhu loyi a weriweke hi khombo** This is also a direct instruction: ""U fanele u xiya ku yima ka munhu loyi a weriweke hi khombo tanihi u tshinela ka yena"" (You must observe the condition of the victim as you approach them).

*   **D: Ringeta ku vona xin’wana ni xin’wana lexi ku lemukisaka** This is also a direct instruction: ""...na xin’wana ni xin’wana lexi ku lumkisaka."" (...and anything that warns you).

*   **A: U nga karhateki hi ku vaviseka ka wena** This is incorrect. The passage explicitly warns against this: ""Loko u vaviseka u karhi u ringeta ku pfuna, u nga endla xiyimo xi nyanya ngopfu"" (If you get injured while trying to help, you can make the situation worse). It implies that you *should* be concerned about your own safety."
I ku cinca kwihi loku nga hlohloteriwa hi Nhlunga-vuhosi wa le Furwa loku nga ni nkucetelo lowukulu eka vatirhi?,"The correct answer is **A: Nseketelo lowukulu etikweni**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the French Revolution ""supported fraternity and the doctrine that the country belongs to the people and not just one ruler"". ""Nseketelo lowukulu etikweni"" translates to ""Greater support in the country"" or ""Increased patriotism"", which closely aligns with this. This is the most impactful change for workers because it shifts the focus to a collective national identity rather than individual loyalty to a monarch.

Let's examine why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Ku suka eka ku sekeriwa ka mintlawa ku ya eka ku sekeriwa a mahanyelweni (From being based on groups to being based on lifestyle):** While the passage does mention military positions being based on merit rather than class, this specifically relates to the military and doesn't have a broad impact on all workers.

*   **C: Ku tirhisiwa ka dyondzo ya Riphabliki (The use of Republican education):** While a shift to a republican education system might eventually benefit workers, the passage doesn't explicitly state this. The focus on the people owning the country is more direct.

*   **D: Mafambiselo lamantshwa ya metric (New metric system):** While the adoption of the metric system is mentioned as a societal change, it doesn't directly impact workers in the same way that the concept of national ownership does.
"
"Endzhaku ka Nhlunga-vuhosi wa le Furwa, ku humelela eka vusocha ni mintirho yin’wana a swi nga endleki ngopfu leswaku swi sekeriwa eka yini?","The passage states: ""Nhlunga-vuhosi mintirho a yi pfulekele valavi va ntirho va xinuna hinkwawo swi pfumela lava wu navelaka swinene ni lava humelelaka ku ya emahlweni. Van’wana va joyine vusocha hikuva ematshan’weni ya leswaku swikhundlha swa masocha swi sekeriwa a mintlaweni sweswi a swi sekeriwe a mahanyelweni.""

This means positions in the military and other jobs were now based on merit (ability) and hard work rather than *mintlaweni* (groups/social status).

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Mintlawa**.
"
I ndlela yihi leyi tirhisiwaka ya ku famba leyi nga tisa swirilo ngopfu eka matiko lama fumeke?,"The correct answer is **C: Swilo swa ku fambisa vanhu**

The passage states, ""...hikwalawokahini swilo swa ku fambisa vanhu swi tisa swirilo swo tano..."" which directly translates to ""however, transportation systems bring so much sorrow...""
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini leswi nga vuriwa hi swilo swa ku fambisa vanhu?","The correct answer is **C: Swi vanga swirilo ngopfu eka lava va swi tirhisaka** (It causes a lot of complaints for those who use it).

The passage states ""Kwalomu ka vanhu hinkwavo va rila hi ti ndlela to famba ha tona"" (Almost everyone complains about the ways of transportation). This directly supports option C.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga tikaka ku swi vona hikwalaho ka ku nga tivi ndlela leyi vachayeri va tikhomaka ha yona?","The correct answer is **D: Nkhuluko wa Nkwetlembetano**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Leswi tisaka ku vava hikuva, ku dyondza ndlela ya ku herisa nkwetlembetano swa tika hikuva awu nge yi vumbi hi ku tiyiseka ndlela leyi muchayeri ati khoma ha yona."" This directly links the difficulty in modeling traffic flow to the unpredictable behavior of drivers.
* The passage also mentions that driver behavior makes it difficult to precisely mathematically model traffic flow.  ""Ku kombisa kahle ndlela ya nkhuluko wa nkwetlembetano wa timovha..."" - which translates to ""To clearly show the way of the flow of traffic"", thus D is the correct answer.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: Rivilo ra nkwetlembetano (Traffic speed):**  While traffic speed is a factor in traffic flow, the passage explicitly states that the *difficulty* lies in the overall *modeling* of traffic flow due to driver behavior. Speed can be measured, but predicting how speed changes based on individual driver decisions is the challenge.
* **B: Ku hleriwa ka ndlela (Road design):** Road design is mentioned as being informed by traffic flow considerations, but not directly tied to the unpredictability of driver behavior.
* **C: Ku tirhisiwa ka ndlela (Road usage):** Similar to road design, road usage is something that can be measured and analyzed, but the root problem is modeling *how* drivers use the road in unpredictable ways.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi tirhisiwaka loko ku kombisiwa nkwetlembetano hi mathematiki?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: Ku tala ka nkwetlembetano**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ku kombisa kahle ndlela ya nkhuluko wa nkwetlembetano wa timovha, ku endliwe ntirhiswano eka swihlawulekisi swinharhu swa nkoka: (1) ku khuluka, (2)ntiko, (3) rivilo."" While ""ntiko"" doesn't directly translate to ""ku tala ka nkwetlembetano"", in the context of traffic flow, ""ntiko"" (density) is a measure of how congested the traffic is. Therefore, it's the closest and most relevant option.
"
Hershey na Chase vatirhise yini leswaku va hoxa DNA ya vona? ,"The correct answer is **D: Tivharasi**

The passage states directly that Hershey and Chase used ""tifeji, kumbe tivharasi,"" to insert their DNA into bacteria.
"
Leswaku ku cinca ka xitekela ku hundziseriwa eka vana ku titshege eka yini?,"The correct answer is **A: Loko tisele ku ri ta switsongwatsongwana**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ntsena ku cinca eka tisele ta rimbewu loku nga hundziseriwaka eka vana"". This translates to ""Only mutations in sex cells can be passed on to offspring"". Option A directly refers to the type of cell involved (sex cells, which are 'tisele ta rimbewu' in Xitsonga), making it the correct answer. While the other options may influence the outcome of a mutation, they don't determine whether it's inheritable.
"
"Hi ku ya hi rungula leri nga nyikeriwa eka ndzimana, switandzhaku swo hambana swa ku cinca ka xitekela a swi titsheganga eka yini?","The correct answer is **B: Xana tisele leti nga khumbeka i ta switsongwatsongwana**.

The passage states that the different consequences of genetic mutations depend on:

1.  The type of mutation
2.  The importance of the affected gene portion

"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki xivangelo xa ku ri ha yini mindhavuko ya khale a yi ri ni timbuti?,"The correct answer is **C: A ti va nyika vunakulobye (They provided companionship)**.

The passage states that in ancient cultures, goats were kept for milk, wool, meat, and hides. Companionship is not mentioned. Therefore, option C is the reason that is not supported by the text.
"
Xikongomelo xa golufu i ku teka nhlayo ya le hansi ya yini?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku cikinya nhonga**.

The passage states: ""Mutlangi loyi a nga na nhlayo ya le hansi yoba, kumbe ku cikinya nhonga, ku fikela ntlangu wu hela wa hlula."" This clearly indicates that the goal is to have the lowest number of strokes (ku cikinya nhonga).
"
"Endhawini ya ku tlanga golufu, hi le kwihi laha mabyanyi ma tsemiwaka ma va lamatsongo?","The answer is **B: Eka rihlaza**.

The passage states ""mabyani lama nga ekusuhi na mbhova ma tsemiwa ya va lamatsongo naswona ya vitaniwa rihlaza."" This directly answers the question of where the grass is cut short in a golf course.
"
I yini xikongomelo-nkulu xa xikambelo?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **A: Ku susa xilo kumbe swilo leswi ehleketiwaka**.

The passage states that ""xiringanyeto i xikambelo lexi tirhiselwa ku susa xilo kumbe swilo leswi ehleketiwaka..."". Options C and D are part of the function of a xiringanyeto, but A is the primary purpose. Option B is the primary goal of science overall, not specifically of a xikambelo/xiringanyeto.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini lexi nga pfuniki ku kongomisa vulavisisi bya sayense?","The correct answer is **A: Ndlela ya sayense ntsena**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the scientific method is a major goal of science and guides a lot of scientific research, but it's *not* the only one.
* The passage explicitly mentions ""xiringanyeto"" (suggestion/hypothesis) and its components (eliminating suspected items, asking questions, testing) as also guiding scientific research.

Therefore, the statement that *only* the scientific method guides research is incorrect according to the passage.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi leswi nga riki ntiyiso hi swihuhuri?","The correct answer is **C: Swihuhuri swo tala swi teka nkarhi wa ku hundza tiawara tinharhu.**

Here's why:

*   **A:** The passage states ""swi nga onha swilo hinkwaswo leswi swi hlanganaka na swona"" which translates to ""they can damage everything they come into contact with"".
*   **B:** The passage says ""Swihuhuri swi ba ndhawu leyitsongo loko swi pimanisiwa ni swidzedze swin'wana swa vukari"" which translates to ""Tornadoes affect a small area when compared to other violent storms.""
*   **D:** The passage states that the most powerful tornadoes have winds that can reach 480 km/h (300mph).

*   **C:** The passage says, ""Tipesenti timbirhi ta swihuhuri leswi swi na matimba ngopfu swi teka nkarhi wa ku hindza eka tiawara ti nharhu"" which translates to ""Two percent of the strongest tornadoes last up to three hours."" This means that the majority of tornadoes do *not* last that long. Therefore, this is the false statement."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi hlamuselaka hi ku kongoma swihuhuri swo tala?","The correct answer is **D: Swi tsuvula misinya (It uproots trees)**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Hi ntolovelo swi teka nkarhi wa ku hundza tiawara tinharhu (Typically, it takes three hours to pass)** - The passage states that *only 2%* of the most powerful tornadoes last up to three hours. This doesn't describe most tornadoes.
*   **B: Swi na moya lowu fikaka eka 480 wa timayili hi awara (It has winds up to 480 miles per hour)** - The passage specifies that this wind speed is only for the *most powerful* tornadoes, not most tornadoes in general.
*   **C: Swi ba ndhawu leyikulu ku hundza swidzedze swin’wana swa vukari (It hits a larger area than other violent storms)** - The passage says the *opposite*: tornadoes affect a *smaller* area compared to other violent storms.
*   **D: Swi tsuvula misinya (It uproots trees)** - The passage explicitly mentions that tornadoes uproot trees. This is a general effect of tornadoes mentioned in the text, making it the most accurate description of what most tornadoes do."
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi vanhu va sunguleke ku swi endla hi lembexidzana ra vu 16?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku endla titeleskophu** (To make telescopes).

The passage states that telescopes were truly invented in Europe at the end of the 16th century. While lenses and magnification were used for centuries before, the *telescope* as we know it originated at this time.
"
I nkarhi wo tanihi kwihi vanhu va ri karhi va andzisa swilo swi vonaka swi ri swikulu?,"The correct answer is **C: Magidi ya malembe**.

The passage states that ""Vanhu a va endla va tlhela va tirhisa tilense ku andzisa marito madzana ya malembe"" which translates to ""People made and used lenses to magnify things for hundreds of years"". Hundreds of years is equivalent to thousands of years so C is the correct answer.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, bakwa ra Muhammad ri nyika xifaniso xa njhani hi mimboyamelo ya yena ya moya?","The correct answer is **A: U teka ku rhula ku ri ka nkoka na ku tihambanisa ni van’wana** (He values peace and separation from others).

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes Muhammad's practice of going to the cave to contemplate.
*   The cave is described as isolated, difficult to find, and offering a sense of complete separation from the world.
*   The description emphasizes the quiet and limited sensory input from the outside world when inside the cave.

These details strongly suggest that Muhammad valued peace and the ability to separate himself from worldly distractions to focus on spiritual matters.
"
"Hi ku hi ndzimana, nsimbi yi tirhisiwele yini ku sungula?","The correct answer is **B: Tindhawu to famba tigolonyi** (Places to run wagons/Wagonways).

The passage states that initially, iron was placed on top of the wooden wagonways. This was before iron rails or iron wheels were used.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ha yini mavhilwa ya tihunyi ma sive hi mavhilwa ya nsimbi?","The correct answer is **D: A ma onhiwa hi nsimbi ya swiporo**.

The passage states: ""Leswi swi sungule ku tirhisiwa, kambe nsimbi yi onhe mavhilwa ya tihunyi ya tigolonyi hi ku olova. Eku heteleleni, mavhilwa ya tihunyi ma sive hi mavhilwa ya nsimbi.""  This clearly explains that wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels because the iron rails damaged the wooden wheels easily.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini lexi a xi vumba vanhu hi nkarhi wa Vuromanticism?","The correct answer is **B: Ntivo-misava (Ndawu)**.

The passage states: ""A mongweni wa Vuromanticism, **ndhawu** yi vumba vanhu... (In the beginning of Romanticism, **place** shapes people...)""
"
I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga kombiki mianakanyo ya ntolovelo ya ku pima hi ku tirhisa thekinoloji? ,"The correct answers are:

*   **B: Nhluvukiso wa thekinoloji a wu khumbiwi hi nhlohlotelo wa ndhavuko**
*   **C: Thekinoloji yi khumba vanhu hi ndlela ya mfuwo**
*   **D: Nhluvukiso wa thekinoloji a wu sekeriwanga eka nhlohlotelo wa politiki**

The passage states that common notions of technological determinism include the ideas that technological development follows a linear path largely uninfluenced by cultural or political factors, and that technology, in turn, ""impacts"" society in a culturally independent manner. The options that directly reflect these ideas are B, C, and D. Option A is the inverse of that."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga fambisaniki ni ku koka vurha?","The correct answer is **A: Mpfumawulo lowutsongo**.

The passage states:

*   ""Kususumeta vurha swi endla mpfumawulo lowutsongo"" (Pushing the bow makes a softer sound)
*   ""loko ku koka vurha ku ni matimba swinene"" (While pulling the bow is more powerful)

Therefore, a soft sound is associated with pushing the bow (up bow), not pulling the bow (down bow). The other options are all associated with pulling the bow (down bow): the symbol looks like a paperclip, it produces a more powerful sound, and it starts at the frog."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi fambisanaka ni mpfumawulo lowutsongo?","The correct answer is **C: Xikombiso xa ku languteka ku fana ni V**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Kususumeta vurha swi endla mpfumawulo lowutsongo..."" (Pushing the bow creates a softer sound).
*   The passage also says: ""Xikombiso xa “up bow” xi languteka ku fana ni V naswona... a henhla swi vula leswaku u fanele ku sungula a yinhleni kutani u susumeta vurha..."" (The ""up bow"" symbol looks like a V, and ""up"" means you should start at the tip and push the bow).

Therefore, the symbol that looks like a V (the ""up bow"" symbol) is associated with pushing the bow, which creates a softer sound."
Masalela ya marhambu ma komba leswaku mavoko ma cince leswaku ma tirhiselwa yini eka leswi landzelaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku tirhisiwa hi ndlela yin’wana**.

The passage explicitly states ""Masalela ya marhambu ya mavoko...ma komba ku cinca loko ka voko ku suka eku fambeni ku ya eku ma tirhiseni hi ndlela yin’wana.""
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi hlamuselaka hi ku kongoma voko ni nenge ta chimpanzi? ,"The correct answer is **C: Swi tirhisiwela ku rhwala ntiko.**

The passage states: ""Voko ni nenge ra chimpanzi ra fana hi vukulu ni ku leha, leswi kombaka ku tirhisiwa ka voko ku rhwala ntiko eku fambeni hi mahlangano ya mavoko.""  This directly supports option C.
"
Ku hlawula ku susa ku hundzuka ka xiaki xa xitekela lexintshwa eka mpfangano wihi?,"Based on the provided text:

The text states: ""Ku hundzuka ka swiaki swa xitekela ku engetela ku hambana ka xitekela, naswona ku hlawula ku swi susa eka mpfangano wa ku hamabana **lowu nga tirhisiwa**.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Lexi nga tirhisiwa**.
"
I ndlela yihi leyi tirhisiwaka ya ku engetela ku hambana ka xitekela?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku cinca ka xitekela** (Ku hundzuka ka swiaki swa xitekela).

The passage states: ""Ku hundzuka ka swiaki swa xitekela ku engetela ku hambana ka xitekela..."" which directly translates to ""Gene mutation increases genetic variation..."" Therefore, C is the answer.
"
"Hi ku ya hi rungula leri nga eka ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi faneleke swi dyiwa hi xihari lexi nga ni fambiselo ro gayela leri fanaka ni ra vanhu leswaku xi tlhantlha “xiphiqo xa tiphroteyini”?","The correct answer is **C: Majenje**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""swakudya swa swiharhi (vuswokoti, majenje ni matandza) a swi gayeki ntsena, kambe swi nyiketa tiphroteyini to tala leti nga ni tiamino asidi ta nkoka."" This directly supports the idea that majenje would help solve a ""protein problem"".
*   The passage explicitly says that plant sources like leaves and beans are difficult to digest raw for creatures with digestive systems similar to humans, making A, B, and D incorrect.
Therefore, **C** is the best answer."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiphiqo swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga vangiwiki hi ku nga kumi tiamino-asidi ta nkoka?","The passage states the following consequences of failing to obtain sufficient essential amino acids:

*   Failure to thrive (ku nga kuli ku ya emahlweni)
*   Sickness (ku sika)
*   Eventually, death (rifu)

The passage does **not** state that difficulty digesting plant matter is a consequence of not getting enough amino acids. It says the opposite - the inability to properly digest plant matter *causes* problems in obtaining sufficient amino acids.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Swiphiqo swa ku gayela**

Swirho swa mintlawa ya ndhavuko leyi humaka eka ndhavuko lowukulu hakanyingi wu kombisa vuxirho bya vona njhani?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **D: Hi ku tirhisa switayele tanihi mfungho**.

The passage states: ""Swirho swa ntlawa wa ndhavuko lowu nga huma eka ndhavuko lowukulu hakanyingi wu kombisa vuxirho bya vona hi ndlela leyi hambaneke ni leyi faniselaka ku tirhisiwa ka switayele, leswi katsaka tifexeni, mikhuva ni ririmi ra xitsotsi.""

"Hi ku ya hi dyondzo leyi nga kombisiwa eka ndzimana, ku nga endleka yini hi n’wana loyi a nga eka ntlawa lowutsongo wa rixaka lowu ku nga ni mavonelo lama hoxeke a leswaku va nghenelela eka mahanyelo lama xungetaka?","The most logical answer based on the premise is **B: Swi nga endleka leswaku n’wana loyi ko tala a nghenelela eka mahanyelo lama xungetaka.**

Here's why:

* **Premise:** The passage states that negative stereotypes negatively impact a child's behavior. It specifically mentions underperformance in school.
* **Extrapolation:** If a child internalizes negative stereotypes about their racial group, leading to underperformance in school, it's a reasonable (though not guaranteed) leap to suggest they might be more susceptible to engaging in risky behaviors. This is because they might feel discouraged, alienated, or like they don't have a positive path forward.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: N’wana u ta ringeta ku papalata ku nghenelela eka mahanyelo lama xungetaka:** While some children might try to avoid negative behaviors, the passage suggests the opposite effect of internalized stereotypes.
* **C: N’wana a nge swi lavi ku va eka swiyimo laha ku na vanhu kona:** This is possible in some cases, but not a direct consequence of the premise provided.
* **D: N’wana u ta ala ku tihlanganisa ni mintlawa yin’wana leyitsongo ya rixaka:** This is also possible, but not the most direct or likely consequence of the negative stereotypes described. The child is more likely to be influenced by the stereotypes relating to *their own* group.

Therefore, **B** is the most plausible inference based on the given information.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, vutivi bya n’wana bya mavonelo lama hoxeke hi rixaka byi nga khumba yini eka leswi landzelaka?","The correct answer is **B: Mahanyelo ya vona**.

The passage states: ""vana lava nga eka ntlawa lowutsongo wa rixaka lowu ku nga ni mavonelo lama hoxeke hi wona ya leswaku a va tirhi kahle exikolweni kutani a va tirhi kahle exikolweni loko va twa mavonelo lama hoxeke hi rixaka ra vona."" This clearly indicates that a child's awareness of racial stereotypes can impact their behavior, specifically their academic performance. Therefore, ""Mahanyelo ya vona"" is the most appropriate answer.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga fambisaniki ni n’wana loyi a nga kula a pfaleriwa?","The correct answer is **C: Ku lava ku va voxe (Wanting to be alone)**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Ku hanya va ri voxe (Living alone):** The passage states that some children are called ""raised in isolation"" or ""grown alone,"" directly linking them to living in solitude.
*   **B: Vuswikoti bya ku burisana (Communication skills):** The passage implicitly suggests a lack of communication skills. Children raised in isolation, especially by animals, would not develop normal human communication abilities.
*   **D: Ku chava vanhu (Fear of people):** The passage explicitly says that if raised by animals, the isolated child will likely show fear or disregard of people.
*   **C: Ku lava ku va voxe (Wanting to be alone):** The passage does not state that a child raised in isolation wants to be alone. It describes being forced into isolation or being unable to integrate socially. The lack of socialization likely contributes to the challenges these children face, not necessarily a desire for solitude.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi hlamuselaka hi ku kongoma ku lava ku va voxe ka vana?","The correct answer is **B: Ku lava ku va voxe ku suka eka ku nga hlanganisiwi na vanhu** (Loneliness stems from lack of socialization).

Here's why:

*   The passage describes children who are isolated due to neglect, abuse, or parental rejection. Their isolation prevents them from forming friendships and developing normal social behaviors. The core issue is the *lack of interaction with others*, leading to their isolation.
*   The passage suggests that vana lava nga kula va pfaleriwa are raised in isolation due to parental neglect and/or abuse. Therefore, it is because of *lack of socialization* that they feel lonely.

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Ku lava ku va voxe ko tala ku vangiwa hi vugono bya miri:** (Most loneliness is caused by physical defects) The passage mentions that some children are abandoned due to parents rejecting a child's physical or mental disability. However, this is not presented as the primary *cause* of loneliness in general, but rather as a *reason* for the initial abandonment/isolation.
*   **C: Ku lava ku va voxe ku vonakala eka vana lava nga kula va pfaleriwa hi vatswari va vona:** (Loneliness is evident in children who are raised locked up by their parents) Although this is true, B is the answer that best describes what causes the loneliness of children.
*   **D: Ku lava ku va voxe ku vangiwa hi vogono lebyikulu bya vuswikoti bya ku twisisa:** (Loneliness is caused by a large defect in cognitive ability) This is similar to option A. While cognitive disabilities can *contribute* to isolation (and thus loneliness), the passage doesn't present it as the *main* cause of loneliness. The main cause according to the passage is a lack of socialization.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i endlelo rihi eka lama landzelaka lama nga fambisaniki ni vurimi bya ku ti hanyisa i vurimi lebyi endleriwaka ku kuma swakudya leswi ringaneke?","The correct answer is **B: Ku humesa swakudya leswaku u xavisela van’wana**.

Here's why:

*   **Vurimi bya ku ti hanyisa** is defined as farming primarily to meet the needs of the farmer and their family. This means the focus is on self-sufficiency, not selling surplus. Options A, C, and D all describe characteristics of this type of farming as described in the passage. Selling to others is the opposite of farming for self-sufficiency."
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga hlamusela ya ku kongoma hi endlero ra vurimi bya ku ti hanyisa i vurimi lebyi endleriwaka ku kuma swakudya leswi ringaneke?,"The correct answer is **B: Ri tirhisa tindlela tin'wana to olova ta ku humesa swo tala swinene**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that subsistence farming often involves simple, often chemical-free processes, using local seeds, crop rotation, or other simple methods to maximize output. This aligns with option B.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   A: I endlelo ra ku kala tikhemikhali - While it's *often* chemical-free, the passage doesn't state it's exclusively so. It's a common characteristic, not the defining one.
*   C: Ri pfumelela varimi ku avelana hi swibyariwa ni vanhu va ndhawu - The passage does not state this
*   D: Swa ha tirhisiwa hi varimi ematikweni man'wana - While true, this is about where it's practiced, not the *process* itself of growing for basic survival."
Ku vhakela muziyamu i muxaka muni wa vupfhumba?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: Vupfhumba bya ndhavuko (Cultural tourism)**.

Here's why:

*   The text defines cultural tourism as traveling to learn about history and culture.
*   Museums are places where you go to learn about history, art, and culture.

Therefore, visiting a museum aligns with the definition of cultural tourism."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini leswi nga xikongomelo-nkulu eka vapfhumbi byo tihungasa?","The correct answer is **B: Ku wisa eka leswi va swi endlaka siku ni siku**.

The passage states: ""Leswi hi loko vanhu va ya eka ndhawu leyi hambaneke ni ya vona ya siku-ni-siku **leswaku va wisa ni ku tiphina**."" This clearly indicates that the primary purpose of recreational tourism is to relax and enjoy oneself, taking a break from daily routines.

I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi hlamuselaka hi ku kongoma minkarhi yo hundza eka dyondzo ya ximodeni?,"Based on the provided text in P, the statement that best reflects a shift to a modern approach to learning is:

**D: A ku na ntiyiso eku dyondzeni**

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes that there's no single ""right"" way to learn or even a single ""right"" thing to learn. It suggests that learning is a personalized experience between the learner and the information.
*   The example of watching educational TV shows highlights that we often seek knowledge out of curiosity or interest, even if we don't directly apply it.
*   Option D captures the essence of modern learning, that there's no ""Truth"" to learning, that everyone can learn from everything around them.

The other options don't fit as well:

*   A and C: The passage states that there is no ""right"" way to learn.
*   B: This option is not stated."

Here's why:

*   **P** describes sleep inertia as waking up intentionally before your usual sleep time and then going back to sleep for a *short* period (10-60 minutes).
*   Option C describes turning off an alarm and falling back asleep, which, if it leads to a short nap, fits the definition of sleep inertia.
*   The other options don't follow the definition:

    *   **A:** Reading for 90 minutes before falling asleep goes against the 10-60 minutes of sleep inertia.
    *   **B:** A shower isn't related to the definition of sleep inertia.
    *   **D:** Waking up to drink water and then presumably staying awake doesn't fit the definition of going back to sleep for a short nap."
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga riki nhlamuselo yo kongoma ya ku kavanyetiwa loku u etlele?,"The correct answer is **D: Endzhaku ka ku pfuka, xikongomelo i ku khomiwa hi vurhongo ku nga si hela tiawara timbirhi**.

The passage doesn't mention anything about wanting to fall back asleep within two hours after waking up. The goal is to wake up briefly and then go back to sleep for a short period. The other options are all directly supported by the passage:

*   **A: Ku nga sekeriwa eka endlelo ra ndzhendzheleko wa ntumbuluko:** The passage mentions drinking more fluids before bed as a natural way to interrupt sleep.
*   **B: Xikongomelo i leswaku u nga pfuki hi ku helela:** The passage states the alarm should not wake you completely.
*   **C: Endlelo leri ri endleka hi nkarhi wa wena lowu tolovelekeke wa ku etlela:** The passage specifies it occurs during your usual sleep time."
"Loko byongo byi ringeta ku endla milorho leyi u vonaka leswaku u yi lorha vusiku byin’wana ni byin’wana, i yini lexi engetelekaka?","The passage states: ""The main reason for this phenomenon is that the result of lucid dreaming is *increasing the length of time between REM stages*.""

Therefore, the answer is **D: Nkarhi exikarhi ka swiyimo swa REM**.
"
I switandzhaku swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga humelelaka emirini hikwalaho ka ku endla milorho leyi u vonaka leswaku wa lora vusiku byin’wana ni byin’wana?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti REM leti nga hunguteka vusiku byin’wana ni byin’wana**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Xivangelo lexikulu xa xiendlakalo lexi i vuyelo bya milorho leyi u vonaka leswaku wa lorha i ku kurisa ku leha ka nkarhi exikarhi ka swiyimo swa REM. Hi ti REM to hlayanyana hi vusiku byin’wana ni byin’wna, xiyimo lexi u twaka vurhongo bya ntiyiso ni ku hlakarhela ka miri wa wena ku nga endleki ngopfu leswaku ku hundzuka xiphiqo."" This implies that longer periods *between* REM stages, due to lucid dreaming, can result in fewer total REM stages in a night, ultimately impacting the quality of sleep and physical restoration.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku hunguteka ka nkarhi exikarhi ka swiyimo swa REM:** The passage explicitly states the opposite – lucid dreaming *increases* the time between REM stages.
*   **C: Ku titshega hi ku va ni milorho leyi u nga ti endlela ku vona leswaku wa lorha:** While psychological dependence might be possible, the passage focuses on the physiological effects on REM sleep.
*   **D: Ti REM leti engetelekeke vusiku byin’wana ni byin’wana:** The passage suggests the opposite, that the increased time *between* REM stages could lead to *fewer* REM stages overall."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, mintlawa leyi tolovelekeke ni mintlawa ya le ka inthanete yi fana njhani?","The correct answer is **A: Ku languteriwa leswaku mintlawa havumbirhi yi tirha eka mpimo lowu fanaka**.

The first sentence of the passage states: ""Mintlawa ya le ka inthanete yi tekiwa yi fana hi matirhelo ya le henhla na mintlawa leyi tolovelekeke, kambe ku na kuhambana lokutsongo."" This directly indicates that both types of groups are expected to perform at a similar level.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi leswi nga riki xa ntiyiso hi mintlawa leyi tolovelekeke ni mintlawa ya le ka inthanete?","The correct answer is **B: Mintlawa ya le ka inthanete yi tirha tanihi ndhawu yo hlangana ya mintlawa leyi tolovelekeke**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that **online groups act as a meeting place for people**, not that they act as a meeting place *for traditional groups*. They are separate entities.

The other options are supported by the passage:

*   **A: Mintlawa leyi tolovelekeke yi tekiwa yi ri ya matirhelo ya le henhla** - The first sentence states that online and traditional groups are *considered* to be of similar high performance.
*   **C: Mintlawa leyi tolovelekeke yi na vuswikoti bya ku ti ehleketela lebyi nga ehansi ku hambana ni mintlawa ya le ka inthanete** - The passage says online groups are more self-reflective than traditional groups.
*   **D: Minkarhi leyi hambaneke ya matiko yi nga vuyerisa mintlawa ya le ka inthanete** - The passage says that online groups can meet across time zones, which is an advantage."
I yini leswi ku nga dzikiwiki eka swona eka leswi landzelaka hi mavonelo ya vanhu vo tsala marungula?,"The answer is **A: Leswintshwa leswi va swi navelaka leswi nga endzeni ka vona loko va wupfa va kula** (The new things they desire internally as they grow).

Here's why:

*   **P focuses on:**
    *   Identifying what people believe or find pleasurable (D).
    *   Internal needs and desires shaped by growth (C).
    *   How the environment influences wants and dislikes (B).

*   **A discusses ""leswintshwa leswi va swi navelaka"" (new things they desire).** While the passage discusses desires, it focuses on the existing desires, beliefs, and needs being examined. The *newness* of desires as people mature isn't the central focus. The passage emphasizes understanding pre-existing beliefs, desires, and the impact of the environment. Therefore, option A is the one the passage doesn't deeply focus on.

**C: Yi na xiringaniso xa xiyenge lexi hambaneke ni tinxaka tin’wana leti tolovelekeke**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that many other common formats (like APS) are *similar* or *close to* the 3:2 aspect ratio of 35mm. This contradicts the idea that 35mm has a different aspect ratio than other common formats.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: Ya ha endliwa ni namuntlha** - The passage explicitly states ""Ya ha endliwa ni namuntlha"" (It is still made today).
*   **B: Yi hundziseriwe eka mixaka ya khamera ya digitali** - The passage states ""swi ya nkoka ngopfu xiringaniso xa xiyenge lexi nga hundziseriwa eka mixaka ya switwi swa xifaniso xa khamera ya digitali."" (the aspect ratio is transferred to digital cameras).
*   **D: I muxaka lowu tolovelekeke ngopfu emisaveni** - While the passage doesn't directly say it's *the* most common, it implies it's a very important and influential format, especially considering its impact on digital camera sensor sizes. It doesn't explicitly deny this statement."

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Xiphiqo xin’wana xa tilense ta ku tshineta swilo i mpimo lowukulu wa vukulu bya ximbhovana (i rivilo) xa lense byi le hansi. Leswi swi endla leswaku ku tika ku tirhisa tilense ta ku tshineta swilo leti nga durhiki a ti ndhawini to kala rivoningo lerikulu handle ka rivoni ra miseve.""  This directly says that a disadvantage of zoom lenses is their slower maximum aperture, making them difficult to use in low light without flash.  Therefore, if you *don't* want to use flash in low light, a zoom lens might not be the best choice, and a fixed focal length lens could be preferable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Loko xikongomelo-nkulu ku ri mpimo lowukulu wa vukulu bya ximbhovana:** The passage states that zoom lenses have a *lower* maximum aperture. If a large aperture is important, a fixed lens is preferable.

*   **B: Loko u lava nhlayo leyitsongo ya swiaki swa lense:** The passage says that zoom lenses require a *greater* number of lens elements. So if you want fewer elements, a fixed lens is preferable.

*   **D: Loko u lava ku rharhangana ka langutelo loku engetelekeke:** The passage says zoom lenses have a greater complexity of design.

*   The passage specifically states that Mysticism *can* be distinguished from other forms of religious doctrine and worship by its emphasis on *direct* personal experience. Option D contradicts this, implying that Mysticism's emphasis on direct experience is *similar* to other religious approaches, which is incorrect based on the provided text.

The other options are all explicitly mentioned or implied in the definition of Mysticism within the passage:

*   **A:** The passage mentions a focus on feelings like peace and a sense of specialness.
*   **B:** The passage describes the search for oneness with God to include seeking knowledge or insight into spiritual truth.
*   **C:** The passage states adherents look for practices to cultivate those experiences."

Option B talks about gaining knowledge through experiences that *happen to others*, which goes against the direct, personal nature of mystical experiences described in the passage. The other options are explicitly mentioned in the definition of mysticism."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i va mani lava swi nga endlekaka leswaku va sungule rixaka ro rima?","The answer is **C: Vanhu va Maori lava humaka ePolynesia**.

*   **B: Nambu wa Sarasvati:** The passage mentions the debate about whether the civilization also extended to the Sarasvati River plains.
*   **D: Vunyingi bya Pakistan ya namuntlha:** The passage states that the civilization included much of modern-day Pakistan.
*   **C: Tindhawu hinkwato ta le n’walungu-vuxa Afghanistan:** While the passage does mention ""north-eastern Afghanistan"" as part of the Indus Valley Civilization, it **doesn't** specify ""all regions"" of northeastern Afghanistan, so it is the correct answer."

The passage states that ""by nature of business"" there's a temptation to think that more people benefiting leads to more available quickly *if* you are selfish.  The question asks what someone focused on quick profit would prioritize.  Therefore, selfishness (vutianakanyi) is the logical answer.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mani loyi a nga hakelela xiphemo lexikulu xa swikoxo swa nyimpi?","The correct answer is **D: Vanhu va le Philippines**.

The passage states: ""A va sindzisiwa ku hakela swibalo ka mfumo wa koloni ya U.S. ku hakelela xiphemu lexikulu xa mali..."". This directly indicates that the people of the Philippines paid a large portion of the war costs through taxes.
"
I nkarhi wihi lowu nga fika ku nga si va nkarhi wa Titemplar?,"The correct answer is **C: Malembe ya le Xikarhi ya le ku Sunguleni**.

The passage states that ""Malembe ya le Xikarhi ya le u Sunguleni a te emahlweni ka Malembe ya le Xikarhi ya le Henhla"" and the Titemplar were formed during the High Middle Ages. Therefore, the Early Middle Ages came before the time of the Templars.
"
I nkarhi wihi lowu nga fika endzhaku ka nkarhi wa Titemplar?,"The correct answer is **A: Malembe ya le Xikarhi ya Makumo**.

The passage states ""Malembe ya le Xikarhi ya le u Sunguleni a te emahlweni ka Malembe ya le Xikarhi ya le Henhla kambe ku landzela Malembe ya le Xikarhi ya Makumo"". The reference to the era of the Knights Templar is in the High Middle Ages. Therefore, The Late Middle Ages came after.
"
I vutshunguri kumbe maendlelo mahi lama nga si vuriwa tanihi lama nga tirhisiwa hi madokodela ni madokodela ya vuhandzuri hi nkarhi wa mfumo wa Roma?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku tshungula vuvabyi bya ntshikelo ya mianakanyo endzhaku ka mhangu hi swidzidzirisi swo hambana-hambana.**

Here's why:

*   **The passage specifically mentions:**
    *   Using morphine from poppy seeds and scopolamine from henbane seeds (B).
    *   Ligature of arteries to control bleeding (C).
    *   Amputation for severely infected wounds (D).

*   **Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment with specific drugs** as a defined concept is a relatively modern development. While Roman doctors used substances like morphine for pain and potentially to calm patients, the structured treatment of PTSD with diverse pharmacological interventions is something that didn't exist at the time."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi ku nga swi vuriwa leswaku swi vangele nhluvuko eka swa vutshunguri hi nkarhi wa Mfumo wa Roma?","The correct answer is **A: Ku vumbiwa ka Rhavi ra swa Vutshunguri**.

The passage explicitly states that the military focus of the Roman Empire led to advancements in medicine. Specifically, it mentions that Emperor Augustus established the Roman Army Medical Corps to provide aid after battlefield injuries. This military medical focus spurred the development of surgical techniques, knowledge of medications, and other medical advancements.
"
Ku kota ku vona ku titshege eka yini?,"The correct answer is **A: Swirho swa ku vona** (Organs of sight).

The passage states clearly: ""Swivono, kumbe ku kota ku vona ku titshege eka swirho swa ku vona kumbe matihlo"" which translates to ""Vision, or the ability to see, depends on the organs of sight or eyes.""
"
Tindlela leti hambaneke leti matihlo ma endliweke ha kona eka swivumbiwa swi titshege eka yini?,"The correct answer is **B: Swilaveko swa xivumbiwa**.

The passage explicitly states ""Swivono, kumbe ku kota ku vona ku titshege eka swirho swa ku vona kumbe matihlo... Swi tele ndlela leti hambeneke leti matihlo a endliweke hi tona, leti ti tikaka **hi kuya hi leswi swi laviwa hi xivumbiwa**."" (Vision, or the ability to see depends on the organs of sight or eyes... There are many different ways that eyes are made, which **vary depending on the needs of the organism**.)

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Ku tikeriwa (Complexity):** While complexity is *related* to the different ways eyes are made, it's not the primary driver. The passage focuses on *needs*.
*   **C: Mpimo wa ku vona (Measure of sight):** This is a result of the eye's structure, not the cause of its variation.
*   **D: Ku rharhangana ka xivumbiwa (Complexity of the organism):** Again, complexity is relevant, but the core reason for the variation is the organism's specific needs."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi mayelana ni Vusikh leswi nga kombisiki hi ku kongoma vukhongeri?","Anwulo leyi faneleke i:

**A: Vusikh i vuyelo ra ku suka a ku hambaneni ka ntlawa eka ndhavuko wa Mahindu**

Hikokwalaho ka yini:

*   Nhlamuselo ya A yi hlamusela masungulo ya Vusikh ku suka eka xiyenge xa ndzhavuko wa Mahindu. Hambileswi swi nga swi hlamuselaka swilo swa vukhongeri, ndlela leyi xiyenge xi endlekeke xiswona, a yi yimeli vukhongeri hi byoxe.
*   Nhlamuselo ya B na C na D ti kombisa swilo swa vukhongeri swa nkoka leswi yelanaka na vukhongeri bya Vusikh."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi tekiwaka tanihi xiphemu-nkulu xa vukhongeri bya Vusikh?","The correct answer is **A: Dyondzo ya guru**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Guru i xiphemu xa nkoka xa vukhongeri hinkwabyo bya le Indiya kambe eka Vusikh u teke ku va ka nkoka loku endlaka xisekelo va tidyondzo ta Masikh."" (Guru is an important part of all religions in India but in Sikhism it has taken on an importance that forms the basis of Sikh teachings.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mindhavuko ya Vuhindu:** While the passage mentions that Sikhism originated from a split within Hinduism and shares some origins and practices, it also emphasizes that Sikhs consider their religion distinct from Hinduism. So, Hindu cultures are not a central *defining* part of Sikhism.
*   **C: Ku ala ku amukela vukhongeri byin’wan bya Indiya:** The passage doesn't suggest that Sikhism is defined by rejecting other Indian religions. It focuses on its own unique aspects and the importance of the guru.
*   **D: Ku vulavula ririmi ra le Punjab:** While Punjabi is connected to the origin and terminology of Sikhism (Gurmat is a Punjabi word), the passage doesn't say that speaking Punjabi is a core tenet of the religion.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, vana lava nga ni Attention Deficit Disorder va tikeriwa ku dzikisa mianakanyo eka swilo swa ku fana ni?","The correct answer is **A: Ntirho wa xikolo**.

The passage states: ""Vana lava nga ni ADD va tikeriwa ku dzikisa mianakanyo eka swilo swa ku fana ni ntirho wa xikolo..."" (Vana lava nga ni ADD va tikeriwa ku dzikisa mianakanyo eka swilo swa ku fana ni ntirho wa xikolo...)
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ha yini vana lava nga ni Attention Deficit Disorder va katsekile eku tikhomeni hi ndlela leyi nga ni khombo?","The correct answer is **D: Leswaku va nyanyula byongo bya vona**

The passage states, ""Vana lava hakanyingi va nghena ekhombyeni, hikuva va ‘katsekile eku tikhomeni hi ndlela leyi nga ni khombo, va nghena etinyimpini naswona va lwisana ni vulawuri’ leswaku va nyanyula byongo bya vona, hikuva byongo bya vona byi nge nyanyuleke hi tindlela leti tolovekek"". This directly supports option D.

I mpfuno lowu va pfunaka ku tlula xiphiqo lexintshwa. Ku tlula kwalaho, ku dyondza ku ri karhi ku nyiketeriwa nseketelo ku endliwa hi khompyuta kumbe hi xiviri.

A: Dyondzo eku sunguleni ka ntlangu wa khompyuta - Hi xikombiso xa ku dyondza ku ri karhi ku nyiketeriwa nseketelo hikuva yi nyikela nseketelo eka mutlangi loko a tiva ntlangu lowuntshwa.

Hikokwalaho, nhlamulo leyi faneleke i C.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga hlamuseriki hi ku kongoma dyondzo ya ku dyondza ku ri karhi ku nyiketeriwa nseketelo?,"The answer is **C: Ku tiviwa tanihi ku dyondza loku nga seketeriwa eku endleni ntirho**.

While the passage mentions that learning by doing should make learning easier and more enjoyable, it doesn't directly equate ""supported learning"" (Ku dyondza ku ri karhi ku nyiketeriwa nseketelo) with ""learning by doing"" (ku dyondza loku nga seketeriwa eku endleni ntirho). It only suggests that learning by doing makes learning easier and fun.

The other options are explicitly stated in the passage:

*   **A:** ""Ku dyondza ku ri karhi ku nyiketeriwa nseketelo ku nga endilwa khompyuta kumbe hi xiviri"" - *Supported learning can be delivered by computer or in person.*
*   **B:** ""Ku dyondza ku ri karhi ku nyiketeriwa nseketelo a hi yona ndlela ya ku dyondza kambe i mpfuno"" - *Supported learning is not a method of learning but a help.*
*   **D:** ""Ku dyondza ku ri karhi ku nyiketeriwa nseketelo ku tirhisiwa ku nyika nseketelo eka ntokoto lowuntshwa wa ku dyondza"" - *Supported learning is used to provide support in a new learning experience.*"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swihlawulekisi swihi swa MySpace leswi nga ta pfuna swichudeni leswi tikeriwaka ku hlaya?","The correct answer is **A: Ku cinciwa ku endla swi olova.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that MySpace pages ""ti nga cinciwa ku endla swi olova ku hlaya."" This directly addresses the needs of students who struggle with reading.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tibulogo:** While blogs are a feature, they don't directly address reading difficulties.
*   **C: Adirese ya webusayiti yin’we:** This helps with remembering the website, not with reading comprehension.
*   **D: Tiphurofayili ta 54 wa timiliyoni:** The number of profiles is irrelevant to reading accessibility."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki xiphemu xa nhlamulo ya Krushchev eka mpfilumpfulu wa vatirhi?","Nhlamulo leyi lulameke i **C: Engetela ku hungutiwa ka miholo**.

Xivangelo: Ndzimana yi vula leswaku vatirhi a va terekela ku kayivela ka swakudya ni **ku wungutiwa ka miholo**. Nhlamulo ya Krushchev a yi katsanga ku engetela ku hungutiwa ka miholo, kambe kumbexana ku lulamisa swiphiqo swa miholo leyi yi wungutiwaka.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki xivangelo xa mpfilumpfulu a Poland?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku veka Wladyslaw Gomulka.**

The passage states that Gomulka's appointment was a *result* of the unrest, not a cause of it. The other options (Vukhomunisi, Ku kayivela ka swakudya, Ku hungutiwa ka miholo) are all listed as reasons for the unrest.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga khumbaka vuxaka exikarhi ka USSR na USA?","The passage states: ""Hi ku hela ka nyimpi ku lwisana ka mafambiselo, endlelo ni ndhavuko ku hetelele hi ku wa ka matiko.""  This indicates that differences in ideology, methods, and culture were factors contributing to the strained relationship.  Therefore, the best answers are:

*   **A: Ku hambana ka mindhavuko (Differences in culture)**
*   **C: Maendlelo lama hambaneke (Different methods)**
*   **D: Timholovo mayelana ni mafambiselo (Disputes over ideologies)**

Option B is incorrect because the passage states Germany was their common enemy in WWII, which led to their initial cooperation. The end of the war and the removal of that common enemy led to the resurfacing of the differences highlighted in A, C, and D.

However, given the options, the best single answer, and the one most directly supported by the text, is **D: Timholovo mayelana ni mafambiselo (Disputes over ideologies)** because the text explicitly mentions the ""ku lwisana ka mafambiselo"" (struggle of ideologies).

So the answer is **D**."

I yini leswi nga kumiwaka eka Timbala-ntshava ta Giza?,"The correct answer is **D: Xihondzo Lexikulu**, **A: Masirha**, **B: Ti tempele**

The passage states: ""Timbala-ntshava ta Giza, kumbe “Giza Necropolis” a Nkoveni wa la va Feke wa le Egipta ti na swihondzo swo hlayanyana (leswi e ka swona xihondzo lexikulu ku nga xona lexikulu), masirha yo hlayanyana, ti tempele to hlayanyana, ni Xivandzana lexikulu"". This directly lists Swihondzo (including Xihondzo Lexikulu), masirha, and ti tempele as being found at Giza Necropolis. While Xihondzo Lexikulu is one of the seven wonders, the other six are not mentioned and are not located in Giza."
A ku ri yini xikongomelo xa Xihondzo Lexikulu?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **B: Ku dzunisa Faro** (To honor the Pharaoh).

The passage states: ""Xihondzo Lexikulu i xin’wani xa miako ya swihondzo leyi nga akiwa ku dzunisa Faro la feke."" (The Great Pyramid is one of the pyramid structures built to honor the deceased Pharaoh).
"
I mani la nga ni vutihlamuleri hi vutivi bya hina bya mutshiveri wa ndzilo loyi a nga lovisa tempele?,"The correct answer is **C: Strabo**.

The passage states that the people of Ephesus tried to prevent the name of Herostratus from being recorded. However, the Greek historian Strabo later wrote down the name, which is how we know it today.
"
I swiga swihi leswi nga kongoma mayelana ni ku pfuxetiwa ka Tempele ya Artemis?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku pfuxetiwe endzhaku ka ku fuma ka Alekzanda Lonkulu**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Ku pfuxetiwa ku hakeleriwe hi Alekzanda Lonkulu:** The passage says Alexander offered to pay but was refused.
*   **B: Ku pfuxetiwe endzhaku ka ku fuma ka Alekzanda Lonkulu:** The passage states the temple was rebuilt after Alexander's death, indicating after his reign.
*   **C: Herostratus u lerisiwe ku hakelela ku pfuxetiwa:** The passage doesn't mention any order for Herostratus to pay.
*   **D: Ku pfuxetiwe hi 320 BCE:** The passage states the temple was rebuilt in 323 BCE."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, a ku ri rini ro sungula loko swivumbiwa swi famba hi milenge yimbirhi?","The correct answer is **A: Timiliyoni ta nkombo wa malembe lama hundzeke**

The passage states ""...hambileswi Sahelanthropus yi nga va yi fambe hi milenge yimbirhi kwalomu ka timiliyoni ta nkombo wa malembe lama hundzeke."" This directly answers the question of when the earliest bipedalism may have occurred.
"
I swivumbiwa swihi eka leswi swa ku famba hi milenge yimbirhi nkarhi ni nkarhi?,"The correct answer is **B: Homo Erectus**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Ndlela yo sungula ya swifambo a ku ri ku famba, vanhu va sungule ku famba va ololokile malembe ya timiliyoni lama hundzeke loko ku humelela ti **Homo Erectus** (leswi vulaka vanhu lava fambaka va ololokile).""

The other options are incorrect because:

*   Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs, but the passage doesn't explicitly say they did so regularly.
*   Australopithecus did not regularly walk upright, according to the passage.
*   Option C is not a type of creature."
Masocha ya le Jarimani ya le matini a ma ringeta ku fikelela yini hi Nyimpi ya Vumbirhi ya Msava?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku sivela Britain ku amukela vanhu ni nhundzu** (To prevent Britain from receiving people and goods).

The passage states that the German U-boats were trying to ""sivela nkwetlembetano"" which translates to ""stop the alliance"" and that the Americans were trying to ""susa vavanuna ni switirho ku tsemakanya Lwandle-nkulu ra Atlantiki leswaku va pfuna Britain"" which translates to ""move men and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain"". Therefore, the Germans were trying to prevent Britain from receiving that aid.
"
"Hi ku ya hi rungula leri nga nyikeriwa eka ndzimana, i mani loyi a nga humelela ngopfu eka nyimpi ya vuthu ra le matini hi nkarhi wa Tsima ra Atlantiki N’walungu?","The correct answer is **A: Va le Britain ni Maamerika**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the Americans were trying to move men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
*   It also implies that if the U-boat campaign (German submarines) had been successful in disrupting these supply lines, Germany might have defeated Britain.
*   Therefore, the fact that the Allied supply lines were ultimately maintained suggests a victory for the British and Americans in this particular naval conflict."
I yini leswi nga swi va kona loko Vaasiriya va sungula ku tirhisa vagadi va tihanci?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Switshamo leswi tlhandlekiwaka ehancini**.

The text explicitly states: ""Switshamo leswi tlhandlekiwaka ehancini a swi nga si tirhisiwa, hikwalaho vagadi va tihanci va va Asiriya a va lwa va tshame ehenhla ka nhlana wa hanci u nga ri na nchumu."" This implies that saddles were *not* available when the Assyrians first started using horsemen.
"
Tinyimpi leti tirhisaka vagadi va tihanci ti lwiwa njhani?,"The correct answer is **C: Va tshame ehenhla ka nhlana wa hanci**.

The passage specifically states that the Assyrian horsemen fought ""va tshame ehenhla ka nhlana wa hanci u nga ri na nchumu"" (sat on the bare back of the horse).
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, hi le kwihi laha u nge kumiki muaka-tiko la tolovelekeke wa Babilona?","The correct answer is **D: Ku tisa magandzelo eka xikwetsimisi xa le ndzeni**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the innermost sanctuary (""xikwetsimisiso xa le ndzeni"") was only accessible to priests (""vaprista ntsena""). Therefore, a regular Babylonian citizen would not be found there.
*   The other options (A, B, and C) all involve temple activities in more public areas, and the passage does not specify the accessibility of these activities."
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi a ku ri swa vaprista ntsena?,"The correct answer is **B: Swikwetsimisiso swa le ndzeni**.

The passage states that ""swikwetsimisiso xa le ndzeni laha a ku nghena vaprista ntsena"" which translates to ""the inner sanctum where only priests entered"". Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"
Xana Hosi Tutankhamun u ve ni ndhuma rini?,"The correct answer is **C: Endzhaku ka ku kumiwa ka sirha ra yena** (After the discovery of his tomb).

The passage explicitly states that he became famous after the discovery of his tomb in 1922.
"
I yini leswi nga endla Hosi Tutankhamun a va hosi ya Egipta leyi tiviwaka swinene?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku kumiwa ka sirha ra yena leri ri nga tshikiwa ri nga kavanyetiwanga** (The discovery of his undisturbed tomb).

The passage explicitly states that the discovery of his tomb in 1922 is what made him famous. The other options are either explicitly stated as *not* making him important (his lack of presence in king lists and his unimportance in ancient Egypt) or are a *result* of the tomb's discovery (the artifacts).
"
I yini leswi mutlhokovetseri Homer wa Mugriki a tsandzeka ku swi endla?,"The passage states that Homer was a blind poet. Therefore, the answer is:

B: Ku vona (To see)
"
Hi wihi Mugriki loyi a nga ni ndhuma ya swin'wana handle ka vutsari?,"The correct answer is C: Pythagorus.

The passage mentions Pythagorus as a mathematician known for his theorem. The other options are specifically mentioned as writers."
Ndyangu wa Vaheveru a wu tirhisa nkarhi wa wona hi xitalo kwihi?,"The passage states: ""Vutomi bya ndyangu wa Vaheveru hi xitalo a wu ri ehandle."" This translates to ""The life of the Hebrew family was mostly outside.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Ehandle** (Outside).
"
I yini leswi a swi nga ri swa nkoka eka ndyangu wa Vaheveru?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: Kaya ra vona**.

The passage states: ""Ehansi ka maxelo yo hisa ya le Vuxa Xikarhi, **yindlu a yi nga ri ya nkoka**. Vutomi bya ndyangu wa Vaheveru hi xitalo a wu ri ehandle."" This directly indicates that the home was not as important to the Hebrew family due to the hot climate and their outdoor lifestyle.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga hlamuseriwangiki tanihi ku hambana exikarhi ka matiko ya Scandinavia?,"Nhlamulo leyi lulameke hi **B: Ndhawu**.

Xiyenge xi boxa ku hambana exikarhi ka matiko ya Scandinavia hi matimu, mikhuva, vanhu, ni tihosi. Ndhawu a yi boxiwangi tani hi ku hambana exikarhi ka yona."
I va mani lava nga tshama a Greenland ku sungula?,"The correct answer is **A: Tinyimba ta Maeskimo**

The passage explicitly states: ""Hambiloko tiko rin’wana ni rin’wana a ku ri ra ‘Scandinavia’, a ku ri ni swilo swo tala leswi hambaneke exikarhi ka vanhu, tihosi, mikhuva ni matimu ya le Denmark, Sweden, Norway ni Iceland."" This clearly says that even before Erik the Red arrived, the Maeskimo tribes already lived there.
"
I ntlawa wihi lowu a wu rhandza ku dya swakudya swa vona wu nga tshamanga eswitulwini?,"The correct answer is **C: Vavanuna va van’wankumi va Marhoma**.

The passage states that ""loko swisiwana ni vavasati va dya swakudya swa vona va tshame exitulwini, van’wankumi a va rhandza ku va na minkhuvo va ri swin’we laha a va tshama hi matlhelo va ri karhi va dya swakudya swa vona.""  This indicates that the wealthy men (van'wankumi) preferred reclining while eating.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga ta tshuka swi va xiphemu xa swakudya swa khale swa Varhoma?,"The correct answer is **C: Vavanuna va van’wankumi va tshama hi matlhelo va ri karhi va dya swakudya swa vona**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""ku hambana kun’wana i leswaku loko swisiwana ni vavasati va dya swakudya swa vona va tshame exitulwini, van’wankumi a va rhandza ku va na minkhuvo va ri swin’we laha a va tshama hi matlhelo va ri karhi va dya swakudya swa vona."" This confirms that wealthy men reclining while eating was a part of ancient Roman dining customs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vaendzi va xisiwana va dya va tshame eswitulwini** The passage states that poor *people* and women sat on stools, not necessarily visitors.
*   **B: Swakudya leswi ku sunguriwaka hi swona swa swihumbana** While the passage mentions dormice as being eaten, it doesn't specifically say they were served as a starter.
*   **D: Ndyelo ya galaguni leyi oxiweke** The passage explicitly states that Romans did *not* have chocolate."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi ku nge endlekiki leswaku swi va ni nkucetelo lowu nga heriki?","The correct answer is **B: Ndhavuko lowutsongo**.

The passage explicitly states that small cultures often disappear without leaving sufficient historical evidence, thus failing to be recognized as a proper civilization. The other options (citizens, city-states, and civilization) are all presented as having a more lasting impact.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini leswi rhangeleke tiko?","The correct answer is **C: Tiko-doroba**

The passage states: ""Matiko-doroba i swikombiso swa matiko."" This directly implies that city-states (tiko-doroba) are precursors or examples of nations.
"
I swiga swihi leswi nga riki ntiyiso hi Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **C: Ndzilo wu lovise swo tala swa swilo leswi saleke**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Hi 1951, ndzilo wu vange leswaku **swin’wana swa swilo leswi saleke swa Drukgyal Dzong swi tshama swi ri kona**,"" which means that the fire didn't destroy most of the remains, and some of them remained.

The other options are correct based on the passage:

*   A: ""Ku vuriwa leswaku hi 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel u endle khokholo leri ku tsundzuka loko a hlula mavuthu ya Tibetan-Mongol.""
*   B: ""Drukygyal Dzong i khokholo leri nga onheka ni tindlu ta tinghwendza ta Mabudha eka xiphemo xa le henhla xa Muganga wa Paro (Eximutanini xa Phondey).""
*   D: ""Ku vuriwa leswaku hi 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel u endle khokholo leri."""
I swiga swihi leswi hlamuselaka hi ku kongoma mbuyelo wa ndzilo e Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku rhandziwa ka xona a ku khumbekanga**.

Here's why:

*   **Q** lexi xi vutaka i swiga swihi leswi hlamuselaka mbuyelo wa ndzilo.
*   P xi vula leswaku ndzilo wu endle leswaku ""swin'wana swa leswi saleke swa Drukgyal Dzong swi tshama swi ri kona"".

B: Mavuthu ya Tibetan-Mongol ma hlurile - Leswi swi humelele emahlweni ka ndzilo, hi ku ya hi ndzimana ya le henhla.
D: Ri hlayisiwe hi Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel - Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel u aka khokholo."

Hi ya hi xin’wana na xin’wana xa switatimende swa nhlamulo:

*   **A: Vanhu va le Vietnam va lovise Phnom Phen** - Leswi a hi ntiyiso. Hi ku ya hi xiyenge, vanhu va le Thai va lovise Phnom Phen hi 1772.
*   **B: Vanhu va le Cambodia va hlaseli Thailand hi 1772** - Leswi a swi vulavuriwi eka xiyenge.
*   **C: Cambodia yi hlaseriwe hi vanhu va le Vietnam emasungulweni ya lembe-xidzana ra vu-18** - Hi ku ya hi xiyenge, vanhu va le Vietnam va hlaseli Cambodia emasungulweni ya lembe-xidzana ra vu-18.
*   **D: Vanhu va le Thailand va lovise Phnom Phen** - Leswi swi ntiyiso.

Nhlamulo leyi hoxeke i A."
I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi hlamuselaka hi ku kongoma ku hlaseriwa ka Cambodia?,"The correct answers are **A** and **D**. Let's break down why:

*   **A: Vanhu va le Vietnam va hlaseli Cambodia minkarhi yo tala (The Vietnamese attacked Cambodia several times)** - This is directly stated in the passage: ""Emalembeni yo hetelela ya lembe-xidzana ra vu-18 vanhu va le Vietnam va hlasele Cambodia kambe"" (In the final years of the 18th century the Vietnamese attacked Cambodia again). The word ""kambe"" suggests they attacked before.

*   **D: Vanhu va le Thailand va hlaseli Cambodia minkarhi yo tala (The Thais attacked Cambodia several times)** - This is supported by ""Vanbu va le Thaiwan va hlaseli Cambodia kotalanyana hi lembe xidzana ra vu-18"" (The Thai attacked Cambodia several times during the 18th century)

Let's look at why the others are incorrect:

*   **B: Vanhu va le Thailand ni vanhu va le Vietnam va hlasele Cambodia hi 1772 (The Thais and Vietnamese attacked Cambodia in 1772)** - The passage states that the Thai (specifically Vanbu va le Thaiwan) destroyed Phnom Phen in 1772, but it doesn't say the Vietnamese attacked in 1772.

*   **C: Vanhu va le Vietnam va lovise Phnom Phen (The Vietnamese destroyed Phnom Phen)** - The passage states that Vanbu va le Thaiwan (Thais) destroyed Phnom Phen.

Therefore, the best answers that directly reflect the information given are **A and D**."
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi khampani ya Dutch East India yi nga swi endlanga hi nkarhi wa vona le Taiwan?,"Impfumelelo leyi lulameke i **D: Ku nyiketela mfumo wa Taiwan eka ntlhandlamano wa tihosi wa Qing.**

Khampani ya Dutch East India a yi nga nyiketeli mfumo wa Taiwan eka ntlhandlamano wa tihosi wa Qing. Ku nyiketela ku endliwile hi hulumende wa Qing eka Japani endzhaku ka ku hluriwa Enyimpini Yo sungula ya Machayina na Majapani. Ntshembo lowu nga kona wa hlamusela leswaku Khampani ya Dutch East India yi ake govela, yi hundzule mikhuva ya ntshovelo wa mavele, naswona yi qache vatirhi va Machayina."
Ntwanano wa le Shimonoseki wu simeke yini?,"The correct answer is **D: Vulawuri bya Japani eka Taiwan**.

The passage states: ""Hi 1895, endzhaku ka ku hluriwa Enyimpini Yo sungula ya Machayina na Majapani (1894-1895) hulumende wa Qing u sayine Ntwanano wa le Shimonoseki, hi ku endla tano wu nyiketela mfumo wa Taiwan eka Japani, leyi fumaka xihlala ku fikela hi 1945.""
"
Mpimo wa pH ya khemikhali wu pimanetiwa njhani?,"The correct answer is **C: Nhlayo ya tiayoni ta hayidirojeni eka khemikhali**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Mpimo wa pH wu titshege hi mpimo wa ti ayoni ta hayidirojeni (H eka pH) eka khemikhali leyi pimiwaka."" This directly links pH measurement to the concentration of hydrogen ions.
"
I yini leswi nga susiwa eka tiayoni ta hayidirojeni?,"The correct answer is **D: Tielekitironi**.

The passage states: ""Ti ayoni ta hayidirojeni i ti phurothoni leti ti tekeriweke ti elekitironi ta tona"". This clearly indicates that electrons are removed from hydrogen ions.
"
I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga hlamuseriki hi ku kongoma ntlhambi wa tinghala?,"The correct answer is **C: Ta xinuna ni ta vavasati i maxaka**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the *female* lions are related (usually a large family of mothers and daughters). It doesn't say anything about the male lions being related to the females or to each other. Therefore C is the answer.
    A, B, D are described by the passage."
I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga hlamuseriki hi ku kongoma ku tikhoma ka tinghala?,"Mhaka yo lulama i **D: Ku tikhoma ka tona ku fana ni swimanga swin’wana leswikulu**.

Leswi hi swona:

*   Xitshuriwa xi vula leswaku tinghala ti fana na timbyana ta khwati, hayi swimanga swin’wana leswikulu. Hi yona mhaka leyi endlaka leswaku D ku nga ri hlamuseli ku tikhoma ka tinghala.
*   Xin’wana lexi xi hlamuseriweke eka xitshuriwa."
Hi wihi muxaka wa swiharhi leswi ku tolovelekeke leswaku swidya mimpfundla?,"The correct answer is **C: Swimanga leswi nga riki swikulu kumbe switsongo.**

The passage states that ""Swimanga leswi nga riki swikulu kumbe switsongo leswi dyaka swihari swo fana na mipfundla ku ya eka timhala kumbe timhuti.""  This directly translates to ""Medium-sized cats eat animals like rabbits to impalas or nyala.""
"
Swimanga leswitsongo swi hlota yini eka leswi landzelaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Makondlo**.

The passage states that small cats eat things like insects, lizards, rodents (""makondlo""), snakes, and birds.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki xiphemu xa ndlela ya ku hlota ya ocelot?,"The correct answer is **D: Yi hlota swihari leswitsongo ntsena**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Yi ti fanisa na ndhawu ya yona:** The passage states, ""Ti-ocelot ti hlota hi ku ti fanisa na ndhawu leyi swihari leswi ti swi dyaka swi tshamaka eka yona."" So, this is part of their hunting strategy.
*   **B: Yi landzelela ku nhun’whela ka swihari leswi yi swi dyaka:** The passage says, ""Va n’wasayense va ehleketa leswaku ti-ocelot ti landzela kumbe ti kuma swihari leswi ti swi dyaka hi ku nhun’wheta ndhawu leyi a swi famba eka yona.""
*   **C: Yi landzelela swihari leswi yi swi dyaka nivusiku:** The passage mentions, ""Swi vona kahle nivusiku naswona swa tivonela leswaku swi nga voniwi.""

The passage states, ""Kwalomu ka hinkwaswo swihari leswi hlotiwaka hi ti-ocelot i switsongo ngopfu eka tona."" Which means ""Almost all the animals hunted by ocelots are much smaller than them."" This means they hunt almost entirely small animals and not ONLY small animals, which can be an important difference.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga hlamuseriki hi ku kongoma ocelot? ,"The correct answer is **C: Ku nun’hwela ka yona a ku tsanile**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Yi kota ku hlota kahle nivusiku:** The passage states ""Swi vona kahle nivusiku"" (They see well at night), which is directly related to hunting effectively at night.
*   **B: Yi famba yi miyerile:** The passage says ""swa tivonela leswaku swi nga voniwi"" (they make sure they are not seen), which implies that they move quietly and cautiously.
*   **D: Yi rhandza ku hlota swihari leswitsongo:** The first sentence of the passage confirms this: ""Ti-ocelot ti rhandza ku dya swihari leswitsongo"" (Ocelots like to eat small animals).
*   **C: Ku nun’hwela ka yona a ku tsanile:** The passage does mention that scientists think they use smell to *find* prey, not to track them."
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki vuswikoti lebyikulu bya yingwe?,"Hi ku ya hi xitandzhaku, Yingwe yi na vuswikoti bya:

*   Ku khandziya (hambiloko yi nga swi koti swinene)
*   Ku hlambela
*   Ku tlula mpfhuka wo leha ngopfu

Hambileswi yingwe yi kotaka ku vomba, xitandzhaku xi vula leswaku ku vomba ka yona a hi ""ku vomba loku heleleke ka nghala,"" xi kombisa leswaku a hi vuswikoti lebyikulu bya yona.

Hikokwalaho, nhlamulo leyi faneleke hi:

**A: Ku vomba**
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini leswi nga ku hambana exikarhi ka tiyingwe ni tinghala?","The correct answer is **B: Mpfumawulo wa ku vomba ka tona**.

The passage specifically states that the roar of a tiger is different from the full roar of a lion, comparing it to a human growl or shout.  The other options aren't mentioned as differences in the passage.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, Robert Hooke u endle yini emahlweni ka vutivi va dyondzo ya bayoloji?","The correct answer is **A: Ku vona tisele leti feke**.

The passage specifically states: ""A a ri munhu wo sungula ku vona tisele leti feke.""
"
Rito ro sungula ra “sele” ri vula yini?,"The correct answer is **B: Kamara leyitsongo**.

The passage states: ""Sele ri huma eka rito ra Xintariyani cella leri vulaka kamara leri tsongo."" This directly translates to ""Cell comes from the Italian word cella which means small room.""
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, swihari swo tala swi ni vuswikoti byo endla yini?","The correct answer is **B: Ku famba** (To walk).

The passage states: ""Swiharhi swo tala swa famba famba"" which translates to ""Many animals walk around"". While the passage mentions animals live in different environments and may fly, swim, or burrow, it explicitly states that *many* animals walk.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini leswi swihari swin’wana swi nga riki na swona?","The correct answer is **C: Byongo**.

The paragraph states that ""It is only animals that have brains (although not all animals do; jellyfish for example, do not have brains)."" This clearly indicates that some animals do not have brains. The other options are characteristics that the paragraph implies are common to all animals.
"
I yini leswi pfunaka swimila eka fambiselo ra fothosinitesisi?,"The correct answer is **D: Dyambu**.

The passage states: ""Swimila swi endla swakudya hi dyambu eka fothosinitesisi"" which directly translates to ""Plants make food with the sun in photosynthesis"". This confirms that the sun is helpful in the process of photosynthesis.
"
Vanhu va humesela yini ehandle leyi swimila swi yi hefumulaka?,"The correct answer is **D: Khaboni-dayiokisayidi**

The passage clearly states that plants breathe in (hefemula) the carbon dioxide that humans breathe out (humesaka ehandle).
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga swikombiso leswi nga sivelaka fambiselo ra ku tiendlekela ka swilo?","Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, **A: Ntlawa lowutsongo wu tsandzeka ku humelela eka ndhawu leyintshwa** i xikombiso lexi nga sivelaka fambiselo ra ku tiendlekela ka swilo (speciation).

Xivangelo:

*   Ndzimana yi hlamusela leswaku speciation yi humelela loko ntlawa lowutsongo wa swiharhi wu hambanisiwa na rikwavo ivi wu ya endhawini leyintshwa.
*   Loko ntlawa lowu wu tsandzeka ku humelela (ku hanya na ku andza) endhawini leyintshwa, a ku nge vi na ku tiendlekela ka swilo hikuva ntlawa a wu nge koti ku hambana ni wa khale.

Hikwalaho, nhlamulo leyi faneleke i **A**.
"
I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga hlamuseriki hi ku kongoma fambiselo ra speciation? ,"The correct answer is **A: Swi humelela loko swihari leswintshwa swi tsandzeka ku tolovela** (It happens when new animals fail to adapt).

Here's why:

*   The passage describes speciation as a process where populations **do** adapt to new environments, leading to divergence and eventually new species. Option A states the opposite, that speciation happens when animals *fail* to adapt, which contradicts the explanation in the passage.

The other options are accurate:

*   B: Speciation is a crucial part of the process of evolution, as stated in the passage.
*   C: Speciation is defined as the formation of new species.
*   D: The passage says that speciation is an inevitable result, which means that it occurrence cannot be avoided.
"
I xiphemu xihi xa mafambiselo ya ngati lama rhendzelekaka lexi tisaka ngati embilwini?,"The correct answer is **D: Tivheyini**

The passage states: ""Ngati yi tlhelela embilwini hi ti phayiphi leti vitaniwaka tivheyini."" (Blood returns to the heart through pipes called veins.)
"
I tiphayiphi tihi letitsongo-tsongo eka mafambiselo ya ngati lama rhendzelekaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Tikhaphilari**.

The passage states: ""Tiphayiphi letitsongo ti vitaniwa tikhaphilari.""  This directly answers the question.
"
Vuswikoti bya switsotswana bya ku tumbela timpiko ta swona byi andzisa yini eka leswi landzelaka?,"The correct answer is **B: Tindhawu to tumbela**.

The passage states that having wings that cover the whole body ""gives them more places to hide from predators"". Therefore, the ability to fold their wings increases their hiding places.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga si vuriwa eka ndzimana tanihi xilo lexi khumbiwaka hi vuswikoti bya ku haha ka switsotswana?,"Mhaka leyi nga vuriwangiki eka ndzimana tanihi leyi khumbaka vuswikoti byo haha bya switsotswana i:

**B: Mpimo wa vutomi**

Loko hi hlaya ndzimana, yi hlamusela leswaku ku haha ku pfuna switsotswana ku baleka valala, ku kuma swakudya, na vanghani va vu kati. Mhaka ya mpimo wa vutomi a yi boxiwanga.
"
I swihlawulekisi swihi leswi hi ntolovelo swi nga fambisaniki na tidayinasora?,"The correct answer is **B: Tinsiva**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Vanhu vo tala a va tivoni tanihi ti diyinasorasi hikuva ti na **tinsiva** naswona ti kota ku haha."" (Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have **feathers** and can fly.) This directly implies that feathers are not a characteristic commonly associated with dinosaurs in people's minds.
*   The passage states, ""Swi na milenge leyi nga ni mahakatimba na minwala, swi vekela matandza naswona swi famba hi milenge ya le ndzhaku ku fana na T-Rex."" (They have scaled legs with claws, lay eggs, and walk on two legs like the T-Rex.) This means that walking on two legs, scaled legs with claws, and laying eggs are characteristics associated with dinosaurs.

Therefore, the characteristic that is **not** typically associated with dinosaurs is feathers."
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga tekiwiki tanihi xihlawulekisi xa swinyenyani ni ti dayinasora?,"The passage states that birds and dinosaurs share the following characteristics:

*   Legs with scales and claws
*   Laying eggs
*   Walking on two legs

The passage does *not* state that all dinosaurs could fly. In fact, it specifically says people don't think of dinosaurs as birds because birds have feathers and can fly. This implies that flying is seen as a distinguishing feature of birds, not something universally shared with dinosaurs.

Therefore, the answer is **C: Vuswikoti bya ku haha (Ability to fly)**
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i xiphemu xihi xa swimila swa ncindzu lexi ku nga endlekaka leswaku Triceratop yi xi dya?","The correct answer is **A: Matluka lama nga tsontswa**

The passage states: ""Triceratops a yi ta va yi tirhisa nomu wa yona lowu nga tiya ku susa matluka yi nga si dya nsinya."" This indicates that the Triceratops would remove and consume the fronds (matluka) of the cycad plant.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi Triceratop swi nga endlekaka leswaku yi swi dya? ","The correct answer is **B: Swimila swa marhavi lama tiyeke.**

The passage states: ""Meno ya ti triceratops a ta swi kota ku pfotlosa ku nga ri ntsena matluka kambe ni marhavi ni timitsu leti tiyeke ngopfu."" This directly supports the idea that Triceratops could eat plants with tough branches.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka mintlangu leyi landzelaka leyi swi nga endlekaka leswaku yi va leyi rhandziwaka ngopfu eswifundzheni swa le N’walungu ya Italiya?","Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, mintlangu ya xixika hi yona leyi rhandziwaka eswifundzheni swa le N'walungu. Eka swikheto leswi nyikiweke, ntsena ku rheta hi bodo egambokweni (skiing) i ntlangwa wa xixika.

Hikokwalaho, nhlamulo leyinene i **C: Ku rheta hi bodo egambokweni**.
"
"Hi ku ya hi rungula leri nga nyikeriwa eka ndzimana, i ntlangu wihi eka leyi landzelaka lowu nga hlula ku va tinghwazi ta misava eItaliya?","The correct answer is **A: Bolo ya milenge**.

The passage states that the Italian national football team ""a ku ri tinghwazi ta Khapu ya Misava ya FiFA hi 2006"" which translates to ""were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006"". This clearly indicates they were world champions in football.
"
Hi le ndzhaku ka xiendlakalo xihi laha swiphemu swin’wana swa Luxembourg swi nga va Belgium?,"The correct answer is **B: Nhlunga-vuhosi wa le Belgium**.

The passage states: ""Swiphemu swa Belgium ya namuntlha a ku ri xiphemu xa Luxembourg hi nkarhi lowu hundzeke kambe yi xiphemu xa Belgium endzhaku ka Nhlunga-vuhosi wa le Belgium was 1830.""
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga khumba vukala-tlhelo bya Luxembourg?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **A: Ku hlaseriwa hi Jarimani**.

The text explicitly states that Luxembourg tried to remain neutral but was invaded by Germany in both World War I and World War II. This directly impacted their neutrality. The other options are not correct because:

*   B: Ku nghenelela eka European Union - The text doesn't state that joining the EU impacted Luxembourg's neutrality.
*   C: Nhlunga-vuhosi wa le Belgium - While the Belgian Revolution resulted in Luxembourg losing territory, it doesn't directly relate to the issue of neutrality.
*   D: Ku va tiko leri nga ti yimela - Being an independent country doesn't necessarily impact the country's vukala-tlhelo policy."
I swikwere-khilomitara swingani swa ndhawu hinkwayo ya Turkey le Yuropa?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**

The passage states: ""Ndhawu ya Turkey, ku katsa mativa, yi endla swikwere-khilomitara swa 783,562 (300, 948 sq mi) leyi swikwere-khilomitara swa 755,688 (291,773 sq mi) swi nga le dzonga vupela-dyambu Asia ni **swikwere-khilomitara swa 23,764 (9,174 sq mi) e Yuropa**.""
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, Turkey yi lehe timayili tingani?","The correct answer is **D: 1000**

The passage states: ""Ndhawu ya Turkey i hundza tikhilomitara ta 1,600 (1,000 miles) hi ku leha ni 800 km (500 mi) hi ku anama..."" which translates to ""The area of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) in length and 800 km (500 mi) in width..."".
"
Ririmi ra Xilatin ri tirhiseriwa yini eka Vatican City?,"The correct answer is **A: Minkhuvo ya vukhongeri**.

The passage states: ""Xilatin xi tirhisiwa eka minkhuvo ya vukhongeri minkarhi yin’wana.""
"
"Le Vatican City, Xintariyani a xi tirhisiweli yini?","Based on the text provided, the correct answer is:

**C: Minkhuvo ya vukhongeri**

The text states that Latin, not Italian, is sometimes used for religious ceremonies.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi vuyeriwaka eka ku hlanganisa mimpfumawulo eka tikhompyutha ta xiyimo xa le henhla?","The correct answer is **A: Vuyimbeleri**.

The passage states: ""Vuyimbeleri nkarhi wun’wana byi kandziyisiwa hi ku tirhisa tikhompyutha ta xiyimo xa le henhla leswaku ti fambisa ni ku hlanganisa mimpfumawulo yo hambana."" This directly links music with the process of combining sounds on high-end computers.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, hi ku tala ka makaya ya le ka ndhawu yihi lama nga ni swihambukelo swo tirhisa mati?","The correct answer is **A: E Mohenjo-daro**.

The passage states that ""the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had latrines with running water in almost all houses."" This makes Mohenjo-daro the place where the most homes had running water latrines according to the passage.
"
Hi le ka tindhawu tihi eka leti landzelaka laha ku nga kumiwa soreji ya xiyimo xa le henhla?,"The passage states: ""Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had drainage linked to a high-grade sewage system.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Le Harappa**.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi endlaka munhu loyi a tswiririkaka eayisini a jika?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku voyamela etlhelo ehansi ka nsimbi ya xilo xa ku tswiririka eayisini** (Tilting to the side under the blade of the ice skate).

The passage explicitly states: ""Hikuva ehansi ka nsimbi ku petsiwe kahle, loko nsimbi yi voyamela etlhelo rin’wana, tlhelo leri khumbaneke ni ayisi na rona ra voyama. Leswi swi endla leswaku munhu la fambaka hi xona a jika."" (Because the bottom of the blade is well-ground, if the blade tilts to one side, the edge that touches the ice also tilts. This makes the skater turn.)
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi hlamuselaka hi ku kongoma ku goveka ka nsimbi ya xilo xa ku tswiririka eayisini xa masiku lama?","The best answer is **C: Ku gombonyoka (The curvature)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage focuses on how the curved blade allows the skater to turn. The ""ku goveka"" (curvature) of the blade is the key element enabling this. Options A, B and D do not directly refer to the curvature of the blade, which allows a skater to change direction."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini fambiselo ra ku pfumelela tiathomu ku susa matimba lama engetelekeke lama ti ma kumeke eka rivoningo?","The correct answer is **D: Mahumeselo ya nyawuso lama endliweke**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Va n’wasayense va vita fambiselo leri nge “mahumeselo ya nyawuso lama endliweke” hikuva tiathomu ti endliwa hi rivoni leri vangamaka, leri ri endlaka leswaku yi humesa fothoni ya rivoni..."" This defines the process of atoms shedding excess energy from light as ""mahumeselo ya nyawuso lama endliweke"".
"
I yini lexi vangaka leswaku athomu yi humesa fothoni?,"The answer is **B: Ku endliwa loku vangiwaka hi rivoni leri vangamaka**.

The passage states: ""Va n’wasayense va vita fambiselo leri nge “mahumeselo ya nyawuso lama endliweke” hikuva tiathomu ti endliwa hi rivoni leri vangamaka, leri ri endlaka leswaku yi humesa fothoni ya rivoni..."" This directly indicates that the stimulation of light on an atom causes it to emit a photon.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eku heteleleni loku nga ta vanga leswaku rivoni ri tshika ku tirha?","The correct answer is **C: Filamenti leyi nga le ndzeni ka rivoni ya tshwa**.

The passage explicitly states ""endzhaku ka madzana ya tiawara filamenti leyi nga le ndzeni ka rivoni yi karhi yi tirha, endzhaku ka nkarhi ya tshwa naswona rivoni ri tshika ku tirha"".
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi ku nga endlekaka leswaku swi va ni khombo ku swi khoma loko u cinca rivoni?,"The passage specifically warns about the danger of touching the metal part of the lightbulb or the inside of the socket while the power is on. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: Ndhawu ya nsimbi ya rivoni** (Metal part of the lightbulb)
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ku endleka yini loko ku hambanisiwa nyutliliya?","The correct answer is **B: Ku humesiwa matimba**.

The passage states: ""Ku hambanisiwa nyutliliya nakambe kutani ku humesiwa matimba wolawo."" This directly translates to ""The nucleus is separated again and that energy is released.""
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi kombaka ku fonela munhu wa le kule laha Misaveni,"The correct answer is **B: Tisethalayiti**

The passage specifically states that you use a satellite to call someone thousands of miles away.
"
I yini eka leswi swa ku tirhiseriwa ku veka thelesikopi le mpfhukeni?,"The correct answer is **B: Tirhoketi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Ku laveka rhoketi leyikulu leyi hundzaka 100 feet yi vekiwe le mpfhukeni leswaku u veka sathelayiti kumbe thelesikopi le mpfhukeni."" (A large rocket over 100 feet is needed to put a satellite or telescope in space.)

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Miseve yo voninga (Light beams)**: While light beams are used for communication, they don't place the telescope in space.
*   **C: Atimosifiye ya Misava (Earth's Atmosphere)**: The Earth's atmosphere is what *hinders* ground-based telescopes, it doesn't put space telescopes in orbit.
*   **D: Tisethalayiti ta ku hundza 100 feet kuya ehenhla (Satellites over 100 feet high)**: Satellites themselves are placed into space. They don't place telescopes in space."
I yini lexi faneleke xi xiyiwa hi xiendlakalo lexi fambaka bya xirhendzevutani leswaku u fungha ndlela leyi nkarhi wu fambaka ha yona?,"The answer is **B: Ku phindha-phindha**

The passage states: ""U nga fungha ndlela leyi nkarhi wu fambaka ha yona hi ku langutisa ku vuyelelana ka xiendlakalo lexi fambaka bya xirhendzevutani. Xiendlakalo lexi fambaka bya xirhendzevutani i xilo lexi endlekaka hi ku phindha phindha minkarhi hinkwayo."" This directly links marking the flow of time with the repetition of a cyclical event.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i xiphemu xihi xa xiendlakalo lexi nkarhi u tirhiseriwaka ku swi ringanisa?","The correct answer is **A: Ku leha**.

The passage states: ""Nkarhi wu tlhela wu va ndlela leyi hi ringanisaka ha yona ku leha ka swiendlakalo."" (Time is also a way we measure the length of events.)
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi tekiwaka tanihi lexi tolovelekeke hi mudyandzhaka wa xiluvelo?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is:

*   **B: Ku tshika university leswaku a ya evusocheni**

The passage states that a direct heir to the throne would normally go to the military straight after school. This implies that going to university *before* the military is unusual. Thus, leaving university to go to the military is taken as the norm."
"Hi ku ya hi rungula leri nga nyikeriwa eka ndzimana, Charles a ku ri wa masungulo wa ku endla yini?","The correct answer is **C: Ku kuma digri** (To obtain a degree).

The passage explicitly states: ""Charles a ku ri xirho xo sungula xa Ndyangu wa le Vuhosini le Britain xo nyikiwa digri"" which translates to ""Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to be awarded a degree.""
"
I tiko rihi laha nxaxamelo wa swikepe wa Trygvasson a wu huma kona?,"The correct answer is **D: E Norway**.

The passage states that Olaf Trygvasson was a Norwegian who led the fleet.
"
Hi le ka nkarhi wihi eka matimu laha Jarimani a yi ri ni nkucetelo wa ndhavuko lowukulu eka Estonia?,"The passage states that the German cultural influence in Northern Estonia was strong ""hi lembe xidzana ra vu 15"" (in the 15th century).

The current year is 2024. The 15th century refers to the years 1401-1500.  Let's take 1450 as a midpoint.

2024 - 1450 = 574 years.

The closest answer option to 574 years ago is C: Kwalomu ka malembe ya 600 lama hundzeke (Approximately 600 years ago).

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Kwalomu ka malembe ya 600 lama hundzeke**
"
Ririmi ra Estonia ri kuceteriwe hi yini?,"Based on the provided text, the most direct influence on the Estonian language was **B: Maletere ya Xijarimani** (German letters).  While the German clergymen (C) were the *reason* for adapting the language, and the letter Õ/õ (A) was *added*, the *basis* of the written language was German letters.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, nhlayo ya vanhu lava vulavulaka Xihindi yi cinca-cinca hi ku ya hi xivangelo xihi?","The correct answer is **A: Loko swindzimana leswi yelanaka ni Xihindi swi hlayiwa**.

The passage states: ""Nhlayo ya vavulavuri va kwalaho yi hambana ku titshege hi leswaku ku hlayiwa swindzimana leswi yelanaka swinene kumbe e-e."" This directly indicates that the number of native speakers varies depending on whether closely related dialects are included in the count.
"
I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga ntiyiso mayelana ni tindzimi ta Xihindi na Xiurdu?,"The correct answer is **B: A ti fani hi matsalelo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Xihindi ni Xiurdu swa fana hi marito kambe swi hambane hi matsalelo"" (Hindi and Urdu are similar in vocabulary but different in script).
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki ntiyiso hi letere ra Hangeul?,"Xihlamulo lexi nga riki ntiyiso i:

**B: Vito ra letere ra le masungulweni a ku ri Hunam Jeongeum**

Leswi swi hoxekile hikuva eka xitlhokovetselo, vito ra letere ra le masungulweni ri vuriwa **Hunmin Jeongeum**."
Letere ra Hunmin Jeongeum eku heteleleni ri cinciwile ri va yini?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

The passage states: ""Eku sunguleni u thye letere ra Hangeul vito leri nge Hunmin Jeongeum, leri vulaka...""  This means Hunmin Jeongeum was the original name for what is now known as Hangeul.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i tindzimi tihi leti nga kuceteriwa hi Xisanskrit?","Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, Xisanskrit xi kucetele tindzimi to tala ta manguva lawa, ku fana ni leswi Xilatini xi kuceteleke tindzimi ta le Yuropa. Hambiswiritano, ndzimana a yi boxi tindzimi to kongoma leti kuceteriweke hi Xisanskrit, kambe yi vula leswaku xi kucetele ""tindzimi to tala ta manguva lawa"".

Hambiswiritano, hi leswi Xisanskrit a xi ri ni xiyimo xo hlawuleka eka matimu ya le Indiya, naswona xi kuceteleke tindzimi to tala leti vulavuriwaka eka ndhawu yoleyo.

Hikwalaho, nhlamulo yo antswa exikarhi ka swihlawulekisi leswi nyikeriweke i:
**D: Tindzimi ta le Indiya**
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ku tirhisiwa ka Xisanskrit ku pfe ku nyamalala hikwalaho ka yini?","The correct answer is **D: Ntlawa wa valawuri**.

The passage states: ""Endzhaku ka ku hlengeletiwa ka Vaupanishad, Xisanskrit xo pfa xi nyamalala hikwalaho ka ntlawa wa valawuri."" This directly links the disappearance of Sanskrit's widespread use to a group of rulers.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi kongomeke malunghana ni nkoka-misava wa lo?","The correct answer is **D: Nkoka-misava wa Misava u nga ku koka ngopfu ku tlula nkoka-misava wa lo**.

The passage states ""Xana nkoka-misava wa lo u nga ndzi koka njhani? ...a wu ta tika ku nga tluli ndlela leyi u tikaka ha yona loko u ri Emisaveni."" This directly implies that the Earth's gravity pulls you more than the gravity of Io. The rest of the options are incorrect because the person would weigh less on lo.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi hlamuselaka hi ku kongoma leyara ya le handle ya N’weti?","The passage states: ""Leyara ya le handle ya N’weti ri vuriwa khrasti.""  Therefore, the phrase that directly describes the outer layer of the Moon is ""Khirasiti yi bumbule"".  Of the options provided, the one that includes this concept is:

*   **A: Etlhelo ra le kusuhi khirasiti yi bumbule**

This option mentions the crust (""khirasiti"") and its thickness on the near side. While the other options relate to the characteristics of the crust, they don't directly define what the outer layer *is*.
Therefore, the answer is **A**.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, khirasiti ya N’weti yi bubumele ngopfu kwihi?","The correct answer is **C: Ehansi ka tindhawu leti tlakukeke**.

The passage states, ""Khirasiti yi bumbule kwalomu ka 70 km etlhelo ra le kusuhi naswona yi bumbule 100 km etlhelo ra le kule. Wu larile ehansi ka swigodhi naswona wu bumburile eka tindhawu leti tlakukeke."" This clearly indicates the crust is thinner under basins (swigodhi) and thicker in elevated areas. Therefore, it is thicker in elevated areas.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi tshembiwaka hi vanhu vo karhi?","The correct answer is **C: Ku na vutomi eka tipulanethe tin’wana** (There is life on other planets).

The passage states that ""van’wana va tshemba leswaku swilo swin’wana kumbe vutomi vun’wana va pulanethe yin’wana yi nga tshama eka ximilana xin’wana"" which translates to ""some believe that some things or some life from another planet may exist on a plant"". This directly indicates that some people believe there is life on other planets.
"
I yini leswi nga lala loku u ya kule na xikarhi xa dyambu?,"The correct answer is **C: Gasi**.

The passage states: ""Gasi yi va yo lala loko u ya kule na xikarhi xa dyambu."" (Gas becomes cooler as you move away from the center of the sun.)
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i xiphemu xihi xa dyambu lexi nga vonakala ku suka eka Misava?","The correct answer is **C: Photosphere**.

The passage states: ""Xiphemu xa le handle lexi hi xi vonaka loko hi languta dyambu xi vitaniwa photosphere, leyi vulaka “bolo ya rivoningo”.""  This directly translates to: ""The outer part that we see when we look at the sun is called the photosphere, which means 'sphere of light'.""
"
I ku voniwa ka yini loku nga pfuneta ku tiyisisa dyondzo ya Copernicus?,"The correct answer is **A: Swiyenge swa Venus**.

The passage explicitly states that ""Swiyenge swa Venus a swi seketela dyondzo ya Copernicus ya leswaku tipulanete ti rhendzeleka Dyambu.""
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga voniwa hi Galileo Galilei hi 1610?,"The correct answer is **B: Swiyenge swa Venus**.

The passage explicitly states that Galileo Galilei observed the phases of Venus in 1610.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, Nambu wa Amazon wu hlengeleta mati ya wona kwihi?","The correct answer is **A: Milambu leyitsongo**.

The passage states: ""Yi teka mati eka minkova leyi ntsongo yo tala."" This directly translates to ""It takes water from many small rivers.""
"
I ku dzunisiwa kwihi loku nga nyikiwiki Nambu wa Amazon?,"The correct answer is **C: Nambu wo leha swinene**.

The passage states that the Amazon is the *second* longest river.  It *is* the widest and largest by volume.
"
I ntirho wihi lowi nga vuriwa eka ndzimana lowu nga qacha nhlayo leyitsongo ya vanhu va le Venezuela?,"Based on the passage:

*   **Oyili:** Phesente yin’we ntsena yi tirhaka entirhweni wa oyili.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: Oyili**"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mintirho yihi eka leyi landzelaka leyi nga qacha nhlayo leyikulu ya vanhu va le Venezuela?","The correct answer is **A: Ntirho**.

The passage states that ""Mbirhi-xa-nharhu wa vanhu va le Venezuela lava tirhaka wu tirha mintirho ya xisekelo"". Since two-thirds is a much larger proportion than the other listed options (a quarter in factories and one-fifth in agriculture), it means the largest number of working Venezuelans are engaged in ""mintirho ya xisekelo"" (basic labor/work).
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ku hlanganisiwa ku pfumelela tinyeleti leswaku ti endla yini?","The correct answer is **A: Ti endla ti elemente to tika**.

The passage states: ""Tinyeleti ti humesa rivoningo na ku hisa hikwalaho ka matimba lama endliwaka loko tiathomu ta hayidirojeni ti hlanganisiwa (kumbe ti endliwa xilo xin’we) leswaku ti endla ti elemente to tika.""  This clearly indicates that fusion allows stars to create heavier elements.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi xitirhiswa xa ku hlanganisiwa xi nga swi vumbaka?,"The correct answer is **D: Matimba (Energy)**.

Here's why:

*   **P** states that stars produce light and heat (energy) by fusing hydrogen atoms.
*   **P** goes on to say that scientists are trying to create a device that produces energy in the same way.

Therefore, the device would produce energy.
"
I tikhemikhali tihi leti nga endla mati?,"The correct answer is **D: Tiathomu timbirhi ta hayidirojini na athomu yin’we ya okisijini**.

The passage states: ""Khomphawundi ya mati yi endliwe hi ti athomu timbirhi ta hayidirojini na athomu yin’we ya okisijini."" (The compound of water is made of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.)
"
"Loko mati ma cinca xivumbeko, i yini lexi nga ta sala xi nga cincanga?","The correct answer is **A: Xivumbeko xa molekhuli (Molecular structure)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Hambileswi xivumbeko xa yona xale handle xo cinca, xivumbeko xa yona xale ndzeni a xi cinci (Even though its external form changes, its internal structure does not change).""  The ""xivumbeko xa yona xale ndzeni"" refers to the molecular structure.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi a ku nga ri xiphiqo eka matiko ya khume nharhu loko ma tingeta ku veka milawu?","The correct answer is **A: Ku lawuriwa ngopfu hi valawuri va mfumo.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the Continental Congress relied on state governments to enforce its laws, *and* that the state governments were often uncooperative. The problem wasn't being *over* controlled by state governments, but rather the *lack* of cooperation and control.
*   The passage clearly states the Continental Congress lacked power (B), amendments needed unanimous consent (C), and there was no executive or judicial branch (D).

Therefore, A is the only problem listed that wasn't an issue in the passage."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi kombisaka hi ku kongoma xiyimo xa hulumendhe hi nkarhi wa Nyimpi ya Mafumelo Lamantshwa?","The correct answer is **C: Vayimeri va mfumo a va tshama va nga ri kona**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""...matiko ma tekele hansi mfumo lowu nga le xikarhi hi laha vayimeri va wona a va tshama hakanyingi va nga ri kona."" This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Swibalo swi sindzisiwe hi Vandla ra Tiko ni valawuri va mfumo** The text states that the Continental Congress DIDN'T have the power to levy taxes and was dependent on state governments (who were often uncooperative) to enforce laws.
*   **B: Ku lulamisiwa ka Mintwanano a ku titshege hi vulawuri bya Vandla ra Tiko** The opposite is true, the passage states that changes to the Articles of Confederation required the approval of ALL the states.
*   **D: Hulumendhe a yi ri ni swiaki swimbirhi** The passage says that the Continental Congress was the ONLY element of the government."
Marito lama nga endzhaku ka Xihlambanyo xa Ntshunxeko ma tsariwe njhani?,"The correct answer is **C: Ma ganamile**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Tsalwa leri ri vonakala ehansi ka papila, ri **ganamile**."" (The writing appears under the paper, tilted.)
"
Singapore yi tiviwa ngopfu hi yini eka leswi landzelaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Doroba ya rihlaza** (Green City).

The passage states that the Singapore Botanic Gardens helped transform the island into a ""Garden City of the tropics,"" which directly relates to being a ""Green City.""
"
I yini Vanda Miss Joaquim?,"The correct answer is **B: Xiluva** (Flower).

The passage states that ""Vanda Miss Joaquim, orchid leyi pfanganisiweke, yi hlawuriwile leswaku yi va xiluva xa tiko."" (Vanda Miss Joaquim, a hybrid orchid, was chosen as the national flower).
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i xiyimo xihi xa xihondzo ta le Giza lexi a xi nga ta va lexi hlamarisaka eka Vafumi lavantshwa va Vaegipta?","Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, Vafumi lavantshwa va Vaegipta a va hlamarisiwa hi **C: Vukulu bya xona** na **D: Ku endliwa ka xona** ka swihondzo swa le Giza.  Ndima yi vula leswaku hambiloko ku aka tindlu leti fanaka na xihondzo eribyeni ku endliwe ku fikela loko ku hela Mfumo wa Khale, swihondzo swa le Giza a ti hindziwi hi nchumo hi vu kulu bya tona na ndlela ya tekhiniki leyi ti akiwe ha yona.

Malembe ya xona ya hlamarisa hinkwavo, naswona ku tirhisiwa ka ribye a swi hlamarisi tani hi leswi a ku akiwa hi ribye nakambe.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, swihari leswi dyaka swimilana ntsena swi suka kwihi ku ya lava mpfula?","The correct answer is **C: A switsungeni swa le n’walungwini**.

The passage states: ""Lembe na lembe hi October kwalomu ka timiliyoni ta 1.5 leti dyaka swimilana swa famba swi kongoma timbala-ntshava ta le dzongeni, ti pela Nambu wa Mara ku suka **a switsungeni swa le n’walungwini** leswaku ti kuma mpfula.""
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, hi le ka ndhawu yihi laha swihari leswi dyaka swimilana swi sukaka kwalomu ka April?","The correct answer is **B: A switsungeni swa le n’walungwini**.

The passage states that the herbivores return ""back north"" after the rains in April. The north refers to the hills of the North."
Vutirheli bya Sealion a ku ri ku hlaseriwa ka tiko rihi?,"The correct answer is **B: E Britain**.

The passage states that after the Battle of France, Germany prepared to invade the island of Britain, and this invasion was code-named ""Operation Sealion.""
"
Jarimani yi ku vitane yini ku hlaseriwa ka Britain?,"The correct answer is **B: Vutirheli bya Sealion**.

The passage states: ""Jarimani yi thye nhlaselo lowu yi vito ra khodi leri nge “Vutirheli bya Sealion”.""
"
I yini leyi nga vuriwiki tanihi goza ra nkoka eka kungu ra Italiya ra ku teka matiko ya le Afrika?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku aka swikepe leswi engetelekekile (Building additional ships)**.

The passage states that Italy *had* built four new ships before the war, but this is presented as background information, not as a specific *action* they needed to take as part of their plan to take African countries. The other options are all explicitly mentioned as necessary steps in Italy's plan.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini lexi a xi tekiwa tanihi xikongomelo-nkulu xa Italiya hi nyimpi?","The correct answer is **A: Ku teka matiko ya le Afrika**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Xikongomelo lexikulu xa Italiya a ku ri matiko ya le Afrika"" which translates to ""The main goal of Italy was the countries of Africa.""
"
I mani la nga endla xinghana ni vahlaseri?,"The correct answer is **B: Mafurwa ya le Vichy**.

The passage states that ""Lava a ku ri vanhu va Mafurwa lava a va endle ku rhula na Majarimani hi 1940 naswona va tirhe na lava hlaselaka ematshan’weni yo lwa na vona."" This clearly indicates that the Vichy French collaborated with the invaders.
"
I va mani lava a va katseka eka Vutirheli bya Dragoon?,"The correct answer is **A: Maamerika ni Mafurwa lama nga Ntshunxeka**

The passage states: ""Hi mavhiki mambirhi ntsena Maamerika ni mavuthu ya Mafurwa lama nga Ntshunxeka va ntshunxe edzongeni wa Furwa..."" which directly supports option A.
"
I ku hluvuka ka thekinoloji yihi loku nga vangela leswaku swikepe swa le hansi ka mati swi sungula ku famba ehansi ka mati?,"The correct answer is **D: Radar**.

The passage states: ""Loko nyimpi yi sungula hi xitalo a swi famba ehenhla ka lwandle, kambe loko radar yi sungula ku hluvuka naswona yi kongoma ngopfu swikepe swa le hansi ka mati swi boheke ku nghena ehansi ka mati ku papalata ku voniwa."" This clearly indicates that the development of radar caused submarines to submerge more often.
"
"Hi nkarhi wa ku swi tirhisa ra ku sungula, swikepe swa le hansi ka mati a swi ri ni swipimelo swa vukule eka xiphemu xihi?","Based on the text provided, there's no direct mention of limitations of submarines in their early use regarding floating, movement, shooting or management. The text primarily focuses on their use during World War I and II, their shift to underwater navigation due to radar development, and the German U-boats.

Therefore, without further information, it's impossible to determine the correct answer from the options given.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mani la nga lwisana ni ntwanano? ","The passage states that the Soviet Union Red Army attacked Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: Va Soviet**
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga endliwanga hi Red Army?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku hlengeleta kambe xisekelo lexi tiyeke**.

The passage states that the *hope* was to either evacuate or consolidate around a Romanian base. The Red Army's actions *prevented* that consolidation. The passage clearly states the Red Army did A, B, and D.
"
Ku endleke yini hi Munjiniyarankulu wa Vukhume wa Vuthu wa Muntariyana?,"The correct answer is **C: U tekiwile hi va le Britain**

The passage states: ""Eka nhlaselo wo tumbelela le vuxeni bya Bardia, maBurithani ma teke Munjiniyarankulu wa Vukhume wa Vuthu wa Muntariyana, Mujenerala Lastucci."" This translates to ""In a surprise attack east of Bardia, the British captured the Commander of the Tenth Italian Army, General Lastucci.""
"
Italo Balbo u dlayiwe kwihi?,"The correct answer is **D: E Tobruk**.

The passage states: ""Hi June 28, Marshal Italo Balbo... u dlayiwile hi ku baleseriwa hi xihoxo loko a fika eTobruk.""
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i endlelo rihi eka lama landzelaka leri nga xiphemu xa nkoka eka ku anakanyisisa ka Xitibet?","The correct answer is **C: Ku languta hi mahlo ya mianakanyo swikwembu**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ntsindza wa ku anakanyisisa ka Xitibet i Yoga ya Swikwebu. Hi ku languta hi mahlo ya mianakanyo swikwembu swo hambana hambana mintila ya matimba ya basisiwa, ti chakra ti sungula ku tirha naswona ku endleka ku xalamukela ku voningeriwa.""

While options A, B, and D are mentioned as part of Kundalini Yoga, which is *related* to Tibetan Buddhism, option C is directly identified as the core of Tibetan meditation.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ti chakra ti sungula ku tirha njhani eka ntsindza wa ku anakanyisisa ka Xitibet?","The correct answer is **B: Hi ku languta hi mahlo ya mianakanyo swikwembu**.

The passage states: ""Hi ku languta hi mahlo ya mianakanyo swikwembu swo hambana hambana mintila ya matimba ya basisiwa, ti chakra ti sungula ku tirha naswona ku endleka ku xalamukela ku voningeriwa.""
"
I mani loyi a nga endla vuyimbeleri bya ku tinyiketela hi nkarhi wa nongonoko?,"Based on the passage, the following singers performed devotional music (bhajan):

*   Sanju Sharma
*   Jai Shankar Choudhary
*   Lakkha Singh
*   Raju Khandelwal (assisted others)

Therefore, all options are correct. However, to be precise, it is better to mention all names.

Final Answer: **All of the above**
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mani loyi a nga endla vuyimbeleri bya ku tinyiketela hi nkarhi wa ku nyiketela swakudya?","Based on the text provided, both **B: Jai Shankar Choudhary** and **A: Lakkha Singh** performed Chhappan Bhog Bhajan (songs during the food offering).

Here's why:

*   ""Jai Shankar Choudharry. U endle na chhappan bhog bhajan."" (Jai Shankar Choudhary. He also performed chhappan bhog bhajan.)
*   ""Lakkha Singh u endle chhappan bhog bhajan na yena."" (Lakkha Singh also performed chhappan bhog bhajan.)

The question doesn't specify *who* performed *first* or *more*. Because both options are specifically mentioned as performing this bhajan, it is not possible to select one definitive answer. I would advise that the question should be rewritten as the two options are correct."
A ku ri yini ku tlangela ka vumbirhi ku ya eka ko hetelela bya nimadyambu?,"The correct answer is **A: Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina na Haris Alexiou**.

The passage describes the order of performances. Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina and Haris Alexiou performed second to last, before Fire of Anatolia.
"
Alessandro Safina i wa rixaka rihi?,"The correct answer is **D: Muntariyani**

The passage clearly states ""Alessandro Safina wa Muntariyani..."" which translates to ""Alessandro Safina the Italian..."".
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki ntiyiso?","Xiga lexi nga riki ntiyiso hi **A: A ku ri ni ndzilo le Santa Clara**. Ndzimana a yi vuli ndzilo. Yi vulavula hi vakhandziyi, xiyimo xa maxelo yo hisa, ni ku hemesiwa ka munhu eka xo khandziya."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mani loyi a nga vulavula hi mpimo wa ku hisa lowu nga tiyiselelekiki?","The correct answer is **B: Mukaputeni wa ndzilo**.

The passage explicitly states, ""Mukaputeni wa ndzilo Scott Kouns u te, “A ku ri siku ro hisa eSanta Clara leri a ri ri na ku hisa ka kwalomu ka vu 90.""
"
A ku ri kwihi laha ku nga na ku tsemeka ka gezi hikwalaho ka xiendlakalo xa tsunami?,"The correct answer is **A: E Tonga**.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, Tonga yi khumbeke njhani hi ku tsemeka ka gezi?","The correct answer is **D: Valawuri va tsandzekile ku kuma swilemukiso leswi faneleka**.

The passage states that the power outage ""reportedly prevented Tongan authorities from receiving a tsunami warning issued by the PTWC."" This directly implies that the authorities were unable to receive the warning due to the outage.
"
Hi rini laha maphorisa ma nga kota ku tirhisa swibalesa swo pima rivilo ra timovha leswaku va kuma rivilo ra Jonny Reid ra ku chayela?,"The correct answer is **A: Loko a chayela hi 160km/h**

The passage states that the police were only able to measure Reid's speed when he slowed down to 160km/h.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ha yini a swi tikela maphorisa ya le New Zealand ku pima rivilo ra Jonny Reid?","The correct answer is **B: Movha a yi ri ehansi ngopfu**.

The passage states, ""Maphorisa ya le New Zealand ma karhatekile ku tirhisa swibalesa swa swona swa rivilo ko pima rivilo ra Nkul Reid hikwalaho ka leswi Black Beauty a yi fambela ehansi..."" This directly translates to the police having trouble using their speed guns because Black Beauty (the car) was going too low, or rather, the speed was too high to be measured consistently.
"
Ku tsekatseka ka misava ku endleke kwihi mayelana ni Butte?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 wa timayili edzongeni**.

The passage states that the earthquake occurred approximately ""kwalomu ka 65 wa tikhilomitara (40 wa timayili) edzongeni wa Butte"".
"
I yini lexi nga humelela hi nkarhi wa hasahasa le Abu Ghraib?,"The correct answer is **D: Khotso ri hisiwile hi ndzilo**.

The passage states that Abu Ghraib prison was burned in a fire during the riots. While other things happened there (like prisoner abuse and US forces taking control), the question specifically asks what *happened during the riots*. The fire is the only option that directly answers that question.
"
Ha yini jele ra Iraqi ri ve ni ndhuma? ,"The correct answer is **D: Ku tshuburiwa ka ku khomiwa ku biha ka vakhotsiwa**.

The passage states that the prison became infamous *after* the discovery of the abuse of prisoners. The fire and the US takeover are simply context.
"
I muxaka muni wa xiendlakalo lowu a wu ta khomiwa a War Memorial Stadium xa Maui?,"The correct answer is **C: Khonsati**.

The passage mentions a ""bendhe"" (band) and a ""nkombiso"" (performance) at the War Memorial Stadium, with an expected attendance of 9,000 people. This strongly indicates a concert.
"
I mani a ku heteleleni la nga nyikela nhlamuselo malunghana ni ku khanseriwa ka xiendlakalo?,"The correct answer is **B: Khampani ya vufambisi**.

The text states that ""Khampani ya vufambisi bya bendhe, HK Management Inc., a yi nyikanga xivangelo xo sungula loko va khanserile hi Ndzhati 20, kambe ku soriwe swivangelo swa vuhleri hi siku leri landzeleke."" This means the management company eventually provided an explanation.
"
I va mani lava vaaki vo hlayanyana va le Bishkek a va va sola hi ku phangiwa ka nhundzu eswitolo?,"The correct answer is **C: Lava vakombisaka ku vilela**.

The passage states that ""Vaaki vo hlayanyana va le Bishkek va sola vanhu lava kombisaka ku vilela lava humaka edzongeni hikwalaho ka ku tshoviwa loku ka nawu."" which translates to ""Several residents of Bishkek blame protesters from the south for this violation of the law.""
"
I mani la nga sola lava vakombisaka ku vilela lava humaka edzongeni hi ku phangiwa ka nhundzu eswitolo?,"The correct answer is **A: Vaaki va Bishkek**.

The passage states: ""Vaaki vo hlayanyana va le Bishkek va sola vanhu lava kombisaka ku vilela lava humaka edzongeni hikwalaho ka ku tshoviwa loku ka nawu."" This clearly indicates that residents of Bishkek are blaming the protestors from the south for the looting.
"

Xiphemu xin’wana ni xin’wana xa Reading Rainbow a xi bumabumela vana yini?,"The correct answer is **D: Tibuku**

The passage states: ""Nongonoko wun’wana ni wun’wana a wu thlela wu bumabumela tibuku tin’wana leti vana va nga ti langutaka loko va ya eka tilayiburari ta vona."" This directly indicates that each episode of Reading Rainbow recommended books for children to find at their libraries.
"
I yini lexi nga va xi endle leswaku ku hela ntlhandlamano wa xitori xa Reading Rainbow?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku hela ka minyikelo**.

The passage states: ""Van’wana va tshemba, ku katsa na John Grant, leswaku ku hela ka minyikelo ni ku cinca eka minongonoko ya thelevhixini ya ku dyondzisa filosofi ku hoxe xandla eka ku hela ka ntlhandlamano wa xitori."" This directly links the end of funding to the end of the show's run.
"
I nhlamuselo yihi eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga vuriwanga hi vatirhelamfumo va Amsterdam na muziyamu malunghana ni nsinya?,"The correct answer is **B: Wu fanele wu ponisiwa** (It should be saved).

The passage states that officials said the tree was infested, dangerous, and likely to fall. The tree *was* saved by a court order, implying the officials *didn't* want it saved; they wanted it cut down. The other options are directly stated as reasons the officials wanted to cut it down.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndhuna ya vukamberi ya RSPCA, vukamberi byi fanele byi tirha eka yini eka leswi landzelaka?","The correct answer is **D: Tindhawu leti xavisaka nyama ni ku dlaya swiharhi**.

The passage states that the RSPCA inspection officer said that ""surveillance and inspection of *meat sale and slaughter locations* should be standard in Australia.""
"
"Hi ku hi ndzimana, i yini leswi nga pfuna ku tiyisa nkoka wa vuhlayiseki bya swihari eka vatirhi va tindhawu leti xavisaka nyama ni ku dlaya swiharhi va le Australia?","The correct answer is **A: Ku tlhomiwa ka ti khamera ta CCTV**.

The passage explicitly states that RSPCA believes CCTV cameras ""would make people who work with animals aware that their health and safety is paramount."" Therefore, the installation of CCTV cameras is the most direct action mentioned in the passage to strengthen the importance of animal welfare for workers in slaughterhouses and meat processing plants.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini ntirho wa munhu la nga khomiwa?","The correct answer is **A: Xichudeni**.

The passage states that ""Mahungu ya leswaku **xichudeni xin’wana** lexi duvuriweke exikolweni hi March 21 ya hangalakile..."", which translates to ""News that **a student** who was shot at school on March 21st has spread..."". Later, it identifies the arrested person as Louis Jourdain, implying he is the student mentioned earlier.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, loko ka ha hangalaka mahungu hi ku khomiwa kun’wana, a ku lahliwa vanhu va ngani lava duvuriweke?","The correct answer is **D: Va mune**.

The passage states: ""Mahungu ya leswaku xichudeni xin’wana lexi duvuriweke exikolweni hi March 21 ya hangalakile eka vanhu va le Red Lake namuntlha tanihi leswi ku lahliwaka Jeff Weise ni **van’wana vanharhu lava duvuriweke**."" This means Jeff Weise plus three others were being buried, totaling four.
"
"Eka nhlamulo ya xitereko, i tiko rihi leri nga si ya emahlweni na ntwanano wa ACTA lowu nga sayiniwa?","The correct answer is **B: E Poland**.

The passage states that after large protests in Poland related to ACTA, ""hulumende yale Poland yi teka xiboho xa ku nga wu sayini sweswi ntwanano"" - the government of Poland decided not to sign the treaty *for now*. This means they *didn't* go ahead with signing it.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i matiko mahi eka lama landzelaka lama nga hlawula ku teka nkarhi ku nghenelela ACTA?","The correct answer is **D: E Latvia**.

The paragraph states: ""Latvia na Slovakia havumbirhi ti teke nkarhi ku nghenelela ACTA.""
"
I vanhu vangani lava nga vaviseka hikwalaho ka xiendlakalo xa ti iPod leti nga hisa ku tlula mpimo?,"The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The passage states: ""Kwalomu ka 60 wa ti iPods leti nga tirhiki kahle hikuva ti hisa ngopfu ti vikiwile, leti vangeke mindzilo ya ntsevu loko yi helerile naswona yi siye **vanhu va hisiwile katsongo**.""
"
I mani la nga vula leswaku swiendlakalo swa ku hisa ku tlula mpimo i leswi-nga riki swa vutiyimiseri?,"The correct answer is **D: Apple**.

The passage states ""...Apple a yi yi tivise hi 34 wa switirhisiwa leswi engetelekeke leswi a swi hisa ku tlula mpimo, leswi khamphani yi swi vuleke “leswi-nga riki swa vutiyimiseri”.
"
"Eka bulo ra yena, Steve Jobs u te Apple yi ta sungula vuntshwa yini?","The correct answer is **B: Selifoni**.

The passage states: ""...u vule leswaku """"Namuntlha Apple yi ta sungula vuntshwa **selifoni**...""
"
Xikongomelo xa Steve Jobs xa bulo ra tiwara timbirhi a ku ri yini?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku kombisa selifoni leyintshwa**.

The passage clearly states that Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone during his presentation and said Apple would ""reinvent the phone."" This directly implies the purpose of his talk was to showcase a new cellphone.
"
I yini leswi Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner a nga swi tivisa eka Thiyetara ya Argentina?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku nghenela ku hlawuriwa ku va muungameri**.

The passage states: ""Man. Kirchner u tivisile xikongomelo xakwe xa ku yimela ku langiwa ku va muungameri eka Thiyetara ya Argentina..."" which translates to ""Ms. Kirchner announced her intention to run for president at the Argentina Theater...""
"
Hi le kwihi laha Cristina Fernandes a nga tivisa xikongomelo xa yena xa ku langiwa?,"The correct answer is **C: Eka Thiyetara ya Argentina leyi nga timayili ta 31 ku suka Buenos Aires**.

The passage states that Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced her intention to run for president at the Argentina Theatre in La Plata, which is approximately 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires.
"
I yini leswi nga kumiwa hi ACMA malunghana ni Big Brother?,"The correct answer is **A: A ku nga tshoviwanga milawu yo kambela rungula** and **B: Vuhaxi byebyo a byi nga hlayisiwanga eka webusayiti ya Big Brother.**

The passage states that ACMA found that Big Brother did not violate internet content rules because the broadcast was not hosted on Big Brother's website.  Therefore, both A and B are findings of ACMA.
"
I swipimelo swihi leswi vuhaxi byi faneleke byi wela ehansi ka byona leswaku byi tekiwa tanihi rungula ra inthanete?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Byi fanele byi tshama hi ku kongoma eka server**.

The passage states: ""Nawu wa Vukorhokeri bya Vuhaxi byi nyikela milawu leyi lawulaka rungula ra le ka Inthanete, hambiswiritano, leswaku ri tekiwa ri ri rungula ra le ka Inthanete ri fanele ri tshama hi ku kongoma eka server."" This directly supports option B.
"
I mani murhangeri wa Vandla ra Liberal ra le Australia?,"The correct answer is **B: John Howard**.

The passage states that Peter Costello is *expected* to take over as leader from John Howard. This means John Howard is the current leader at the time of the statement.
"
Ha yini Australia yi nga si va ni vumaki bya matimba ya nyutliya?,"Based on the provided text, the most accurate answer is **D: Yi durha ngopfu**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly mentions that Costello is waiting to see if nuclear power generation is **economically viable (""tirha kahle hi tlhelo ikhonomi"")**. This directly relates to the cost factor.
*   While the other options (lack of public support, controversial nature, danger) might be concerns in general, they are not directly addressed in the provided quote from Costello. His primary focus seems to be on the economic feasibility.
*   The text does not mention the lack of public support as a reason why Australia does not produce nuclear power.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is D."
I murheti wihi wa le ayisini loyi a nga phikizana hi mpfuno wa mukongomisi?,"The correct answer is **C: Maciej Krezel**.

The passage states: ""Murheti wa le asiyini wa le Poland loyi a nga voniki kahle ku nga Maciej Krezel ni mukongomisi ku nga Anna Ogarzynska va hetelele eka khumemune eka Super-G."" This clearly indicates that Maciej Krezel is the visually impaired ice racer who competed with the help of a guide.
"
I tiko rihi leri nga hetelela eka vukhume eka Super-G ya vavasati?,"The passage states: ""Finland ni Katja Saarinen u hetelele eka vukhume eka xiendlakelo lexi fanaka"" (Finland and Katja Saarinen finished tenth in the same event).  ""Xiendlakelo lexi fanaka"" refers to the Super-G ya vavasati (women's Super-G).

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: E Finland**.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi malunghana ni Blake leswi nga riki swo kongoma?","The correct answer is **B: U pfumele ku hlasela**.

Here's why:

*   **A: U khomiwe kwalaho (He was arrested on the spot)** - The passage states ""Muhaxi, loyi a khomiweke kwahalaho..."" indicating Blake was arrested.
*   **C: U tirhise mhanzi hi nkarhi wa ku hlasela (He used the hammer during the assault)** - The passage mentions he used the hammer for self-defense, implying he used it during the incident.
*   **D: U vule leswaku u hoxiwe hi mabodlela (He said he was hit with bottles)** - The passage states ""u te mhanzi u yi tirhisele ku ti sirhelela loko vanhu vo ringana makume-nharhu va n’wi hoxe hi mabodlela (he said he used the hammer to defend himself when about thirty people threw bottles at him).""

However, the passage explicitly states the muhaxi *kanete ku hlasela* (denied the assault). Therefore, it is incorrect to say that Blake ""pfumele ku hlasela (admitted to the assault)""."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga humelelanga Blake?","The correct answer is **C: U hlaseriwe hi mhanzi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the broadcaster claimed to have used the *mhanzi* (axe) for self-defense *after* being attacked with bottles. It does **not** say Blake was attacked *with* an axe.
*   The passage states that Blake was arrested, was told he may go to jail, and was arrested for attempting to pervert the course of justice."
I yini leswi mali ya U.N. yo hakela matiko lama khumbiwaka hi ku hisa ka misava yi nge tirhisiwiki eka swona?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku tisa thekinoloji ku pfuna matiko lama endlaka nhluvuko**.

The passage states the following:

*   **P:** The U.N. hopes to have funds to compensate countries affected by global warming to deal with its effects. The money can be used for:

    *   Houses that can withstand flooding
    *   Better water management
    *   Planting different crops

The passage only mentions that *sharing* technology to help developing countries was one of the topics discussed. It does not say that the U.N. compensation fund would be used to *bring* that technology to developing countries.

Therefore, the money *would not* be used for bringing technology to help developing countries.
Options A, C and D are mentioned in the passage as potential uses of the funds."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, U.N. yi na ntshembo wa ku ponisa yini?","The correct answer is **A: Mali, hi ku avelana ka thekinoloji**.

The passage states that the U.N. hopes to ""hetisisa ku va ni mali yo hakela matiko lama khumbekaka hi ku hisa ka misava"" (secure funds to pay countries affected by global warming) and that technology sharing was also discussed. The other options are examples of *how* the money *might* be used, not what the U.N. hopes to secure.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga vuriwanga hi Albert Muchanga tanihi swilo leswi va ha ta pfumelelana hi swona?,"The correct answer is **A: Loko Benin yi ta nghenela AfCTA**.

Here's why:

*   **C: Milawu ya ku sungula:** Muchanga u vule leswaku a va se pfumelelana eka milawu.
*   **D: Ntsengo wa swo famba:** Muchanga u vule leswaku a va se pfumelelana eka ntsengo wa swo famba.
*   **B: Siku leri ku sungulaka ku xavisa:** Muchanga u vule leswaku va ta sungula ku xavisa hi July 1, 2020.

Ntsheketo a wu vuli nchumu hi leswaku Benin yi ta nghenela rini."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ha yini ku xavisa ku nga ta sungula hi July?","The correct answer is **B: Ku vekiwe milawu na ntsengo wa swo famba leyi ringaneke**.

The passage states: ""A hi si pfumelelana eka milawu na ntsengo wa swo famba, kambe *leswi hi nga na swona swi ringene* leswaku hi sungula ku xavisa hi July 1, 2020"". This directly supports option B. The commissionar indicates that even though all the rules and procedures of transactions were not in place, that they had enough in place to begin trading.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini leswi Atlanta Journal-Constitution yi nga sola vatirhi va swa dyondzo hi swona?","The correct answer is **C: Ku kumiwa ka swiphiqo kambe va nga endlanga nchumu hi sweswo**.

The passage states: ""Xiviko xi kombise leswaku mbuyelo wa swikambelo wu tlakukeke hi ndlela leyi hlamarisaka swinene hi ku hatlisa,naswona xi hehla leswaku xikolo xi kume swiphiqo kambe a xi endlanga nchumu hi sweswo."" This directly supports option C.
"
"Hi ku ya hi rungula leri nga nyikeriwa eka ndzimana, i yini lexi nga vuriwanga eka xiviko xa Atlanta Journal-Constitution?","The correct answer is **B: Vumbhoni bya ku kanvanyetiwa ka maphephe ya swikambelo.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution *revealed issues with the test scores*. The passage mentions the test tampering was revealed in 2013.
*   The passage states that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution *revealed issues with the test scores*.
*   The passage states that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution *revealed issues with the test scores*.
*   The passage does not say that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution discussed the actions of doing something different in terms of urban education.

Therefore, the only information **NOT** included in the newspaper's report, according to the passage, is concrete proof or evidence of test tampering.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i rungula rihi leri tivekaka endzhaku ka ku bomiwa?","The correct answer is **B: Miako leyi tibomu ti bulukeke ekusuhi na yona**.

The passage states: ""Tibomu tinharhu ti buluke kusuhi na miako ya mfumo..."" which means that it is known that the bombs exploded near government buildings. The passage also states that the final number of casualties is unknown (A) and that the reliable reports only confirm the number of injured (and not deaths) to be 30 (D). Option C is an assumption as the passage does not mention if there would be any more bombs that are going to be detonated.
"
"Ku sukela a nga nghenela Manchester City hi 2017, Jesus u tlange ka mintlangu yingani?","The correct answer is **D: 53**

The passage states that ""Muburazili loyi u tlange mintlangu ya 53 eka tlilaba.""
"
I tlilaba yihi leyi Jesus a nga kuma ntsengo wa £27 wa timiliyoni hi ku nghenelela?,"The correct answer is **B: Manchester City**.

The passage states that Jesus joined Manchester City for a reported fee of £27 million.
"
I swiga swihi malunghana ni vaendzi va hostela leswi nga riki ntiyiso?,"The correct answer is **D: Votala va vaendzi a va huma eka doroba ya ku kwetsima**.

Here's why:

*   **P states:** ""Votala ka vaendzi lava a va fikele eka hositele a va huma eUnited Arab Emirates."" This clearly indicates that most of the visitors were *not* from the holy city itself, but rather from the United Arab Emirates.
The other options are true according to passage P
*   **P states:** ""...lava a va tele ku vhakela doroba ra ku kwetsima eka siku ra le mahlweni ka hajj pilgrimage.""
*   **P states:** ""...lava a va tele ku vhakela doroba ra ku kwetsima...""
*   **P states:** ""...eka siku ra le mahlweni ka hajj pilgrimage"""
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga ntiyiso?","The correct answer is **C: Vaendzi a va tele eve of hajj pilgrimage**.

Here's why:

*   **P** mentions, ""...vanhu vo hlayanyana lava a va tele ku vhakela doroba ra ku kwetsima eka siku ra le mahlweni ka hajj pilgrimage."" This directly states that visitors were there on the eve of the Hajj pilgrimage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: A ku na vanhu lava feke** - This is incorrect. The paragraph states ""Vanhu lava feke va sungula eka 15..."" which clearly states 15 people have died.
*   **B: Vaendzi hinkwavo a va huma eUnited Arab Emirates** - This is incorrect. The paragraph states, ""Votala ka vaendzi lava a va fikele eka hositele a va huma eUnited Arab Emirates."" which means most, not all, of the visitors came from the UAE.
*   **D: Votala va vaendzi a ku ri vanhu va le Mecca** - This is incorrect. The paragraph does not say that the visitors were from Mecca. In fact, it implies the opposite by mentioning they were visiting the city."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i rungula rihi malunghana ni ku tlumbana leri nga tiyisekangiki?","The correct answer is **D: Ndhawu ya ti debiri**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Vukulu bya ku tlumbana (The magnitude of the collision):** The passage explicitly states that scientists are still trying to determine the magnitude (""Na sweswi va ha ringeta ku vona vukulu bya ku tlumbana""). So, this is confirmed as uncertain.
*   **B: Ndlela leyi Misava yi nga ta khumbekaka ha yona hikwalaho ka ku tlumbana (The way the Earth will be affected by the collision):** The passage states that scientists are still trying to determine how the Earth will be affected (""na ndlela leyi misava yi nga ta khumbekaka ha yona""). So, this is confirmed as uncertain.
*   **D: Ndhawu ya ti debiri (The location of the debris):** The United States Strategic Command is conducting debris analysis, and they will post the results publicly. This analysis implies they *are* in the process of finding and therefore have not yet located the location of the debris, which is uncertain.

Therefore, **D** is the best answer, as the current location is uncertain."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini leswi va ha ringeta ku swi vona malunghana ni ku tlumbana?","The correct answer is **D: Vukulu lebyi kongomeke bya ku tlumbana** (The exact size of the collision).

The passage states: ""Na sweswi va ha ringeta ku vona vukulu bya ku tlumbana na ndlela leyi misava yi nga ta khumbekaka ha yona."" (Right now they are still trying to find the size of the collision and how the earth will be affected).

Therefore, they are trying to determine the exact size of the collision.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, u tshama a ri eka ndhawu yihi Batten eka nxaxamelo wa Maamerika lama Fuweke Swinene?","The correct answer is **C: Ya vu 190**

The passage states that Batten ranked 190 out of 400 in the list of Wealthiest Americans.
"
Batten u hoxe xandla eka yini eka leswi landzelaka?,"The correct answer is **B: Yunivhesiti ya Virginia** and **D: Tikholichini ta vutshila na sayense**.

The passage states that Batten graduated from the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Virginia. This means he contributed by being an alumnus. The passage also states he ""hoxe xandla swinene eka xivandla xexo"", meaning he made significant contributions to that field, which the previous sentence identifies as the College of Arts and Sciences.
"
I yini lexi nga riki xiphemu xa nawu lowu nga sayiniwa hi Murhangeri Arnold Schwarzenegger?,"Nhlamulo leyi faneleke i **C: Ku sivela ku xavisiwa kumbe ku lombisiwa ka mintlangu ya ti vhidiyo leyi nga ni madzolonga eka vana lavatsongo va le handle ka California**.

Nawu wu khumba ntsena ku xavisiwa ka mintlangu eCarlifonia, hayi ematikweni man'wana. A, B, na D swi hlamusela swiphemu swa nawu hi ku kongoma.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mani la nga twanga swilo leswi a swi vuriwa?","The correct answer is **C: Miller**.

The passage states that ""Miller u te, “Mike u vulavula ngopfu hi nkarhi wa nhlangano ...A ndzi nga swi twi kahle leswi a a swi vula.”"" This clearly indicates that Miller was the one who didn't understand what was being said.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga ntiyiso hi leswi nga humelela Miller eka nhlangano?","The correct answer is **B: A nga nyikele nyingiso loko a ri karhi a ti lunghisa**.

Here's why:

*   Miller's comment, ""A ndzi nga swi twi kahle leswi a a swi vula,"" suggests that Miller wasn't paying close attention and was perhaps distracted by their own appearance.
*   The other options are not supported by the passage. The passage mentions Duvall was talkative, not the children, and it is not suggested that Duval impressed Miller."
I mani la nga ringanyeta leswaku ku kambisisiwa “Nawu wa Moya wo Tenga”?,"The correct answer is **D: Stephen Harper**.

The passage states: ""Holobyenkulu Stephen Harper u pfumerile ku rhumela ‘Nawu wa Moya wo Tenga’ wa hulumendhe eka komiti ya mavandla hinkwawo ku wu kambisisa..."" This directly indicates that Stephen Harper agreed to send the ""Clean Air Act"" for review.
"
I mani la nga kaneta leswaku “Nawu wa Moya wo Tenga” a ku ri xiendlo lexi tanihi ndlela yo kavenyeta nhlawulo lowu nga ta endliwa?,"The passage states that ""hulumendhe ya mfumo na ti-MP tin’wana ta federali va sole xiendlo lexi tanihi ndlela yo kavenyeta nhlawulo lowu nga ta endliwa hi Hukuri."" ""Xiendlo lexi"" in this context refers to the federal government controlling funds for the Mersey hospital. This control was protested as an attempt to influence the upcoming election. However, the question is asking who protested the ""Clean Air Act"" as an attempt to influence the upcoming election. This refers to the first part of the text, where there is no mention of the Clean Air Act being protested as an attempt to influence the upcoming election. So this question cannot be answered.

However, there's a strong indicator that ""Federali ya MP"" in option D is a reference to Federal MPs.

Therefore, the most likely answer based on the information provided is D: Federali ya MP.

However, this answer does not refer to the Clean Air Act, rather it refers to the funds of the Mersey hospital.
"
Tikhomphawundi ta cyanuric asidi na melamine ti endle yini loko ti cinca ti hlangana eka murhundzu wa swimanga?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti khirisitali**.

The passage states that cyanuric acid and melamine ""change when combined to form crystals that can block kidney function."" The researchers induced this process in cat kidneys.
"
Valavisisi va tirhise infrared spectroscopy ku vona yini?,"The correct answer is **B: Endlelo ra ti khirisitali eka murhundzu wa swiharhi swa le kaya**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the researchers used infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to compare the crystals formed in the cat's kidneys (from melamine and cyanuric acid) with the crystals found in the kidneys of animals affected by the contaminated food. This comparison was to see if the crystal formation process was the same.
"
I mani la nga vitana Luna tanihi “Hosi Ya Xisati ya Xiyimo Xa le Henhla Ngopfu”?,"The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The passage states: ""Tommy Dreamer u te “Luna a a ri Hosi Ya Xisati ya Xiyimo Xa le Henhla Ngopfu."" (Tommy Dreamer said “Luna was the Queen of Extreme.”)
"
I mani loyi a nga vitana Luna tanihi “hambanile”?,"The correct answer is **B: Dustin Runnels**.

Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnels explicitly said ""Luna a a hambanile hi ndlela leyinene ku fana na mina...""
"
I yini leswi nga si humelela eka muchayeri la nga katseka eka ntlumbano?,"The correct answer is **D: Vukorhokeri bya xihatla byi pfune ku n’wi susa eka movha wa yena** (Emergency services helped to get him out of his car).

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""vukorhokeri bya xihatla va ntshuxe muchayeri eka Audi TT yo tshuka"" which translates to ""emergency services rescued the driver from the red Audi TT"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: U vaviseke enhlokweni** (He hurt his head) - While true, this is what *did* happen, not what *didn't* happen. The question asks what didn't happen to him.
*   **B: A nga vavisanga na un’we wa vanhu lava a va ri endzeni ka movha** (He did not hurt any of the people who were inside the car) - True, but this also *did* happen.
*   **C: U susiwile exibedlhela xa Cambridge a ya eGreat Yarmouth** (He was removed from Cambridge hospital to Great Yarmouth) - The passage says the *opposite*; he was moved *from* Great Yarmouth *to* Cambridge."
I yini leswi a swi nga humelelanga hi ndlela yo tlanga ya Afrika Dzonga hi nkarhi wa mphikizano wa rugby?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku tlanga kahle eku sunguleni ka mphikizano (Playing well at the beginning of the competition)**.

The passage states: ""Hambiloko Afrika Dzonga yi tikombe yi nga tlangi kahle eka mphikizano lowu a va ri na wona ni vamakwavo va xisati va le dzongeni, tlangelo ra vona ri antswisiwile swinene loko mphikizano wuya emahleni."" which means: ""Even though South Africa didn't play well at the beginning of the competition against their southern sisters, their play improved greatly as the competition went on.""

The other options are incorrect because the passage indicates that good ball handling skills (B), and good cooperation (A) were strengths of the South African team. It doesn't mention anything about their defense (D).
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ntlangu wa Afrika Dzonga wu sungule rini ku antswa?","The correct answer is **D: Loko mphikizano wu ya emahlweni**.

The passage states: ""Hambiloko Afrika Dzonga yi tikombe yi nga tlangi kahle eka mphikizano lowu a va ri na wona ni vamakwavo va xisati va le dzongeni, tlangelo ra vona ri antswisiwile swinene loko mphikizano wuya emahleni.""

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi leswi landzelaka leswi nga hlamuseriki hi ku kongoma ikhonomi ya Chayina?","Nhlamulo leyi faneleke i **D: Chayina a yi si tshama yi xavisele matiko timovha to tala ku hundza Jarimani**.

Ndza pfumela leswaku nhlamulo leyi faneleke i D hikuva ndzimana yi vula hi ku kongoma leswaku ""lembe leri hundzeke Chayina yi xavisele matiko timovha to tala ku hundza Jarimani"". Hikokwalaho, xiga D, lexi vulaka leswi hambaneke, a xi hlamuseli hi ku kongoma ikhonomi ya Chayina hi ku ya hi ndzimana.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, GDP ya Chayina yi nga hundza ya le United States rini?","The correct answer is **B: Eka malembe ya makume mbirhi**.

The paragraph states: ""GDP ya Chayina yi nga hundza ya le United States eka malembe ya makume mbirhi."" (China's GDP may surpass that of the United States in two decades.)
"
I yini leswi Hu a nga swi ringanyeta leswaku matiko lama hluvukaka ma swi endla?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku papalata maendlelo ya khale yo thyakisa** (To avoid old practices of polluting first).

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states that Hu encouraged developing forces to ""avoid old ways of polluting first and cleaning up later."" This aligns directly with option D.
* The passage implies the contrary of option A and C when it says that they ""should not, however, be asked to bear responsibilities that are above their level of development, responsibilities and capabilities.""
*   While B (Ku dzika eka mpindzulo wa ikhonomi - To focus on economic benefits) is mentioned in the context of China's actions, the suggestion for developing *forces* is specifically about avoiding polluting practices.
"
I yini leswi nga vuriwanga hi Hu?,"The correct answer is **D: Mpimo wa ku hunguteka ka nthyakiso wa carbon**.

Here's why:

*   **A:** Hu mentions the *goal* of reducing carbon intensity, which is related to making a reduction.

The passage states, ""Muchayeri wa lori, wa malembe ya 64, a nga vavisekaka loko yi chayisile."" (The lorry driver, 64 years old, was not injured in the collision.)
"
Ku endleke yini hi vanhu lava nga katseka eka khombo?,"The correct answer is **B: Un’we u vavisekile, un’we u file**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Gibson was taken to the hospital but died soon after, so one person died.
*   The passage states that ""Muchayeri wa lori, wa malembe ya 64, a nga vavisekaka loko yi chayisile"" (The 64-year-old lorry driver was not injured when it collided.) so the driver survived.

Van’wasayense lava tirhaka eka nongonoko a va tshemba leswaku va ta vona nhlohlotelo wihi eka leswi landzelaka?,"The correct answer is **D: Nchumu wa ntima**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states that the program was written to detect the effects of dark matter on the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, influenced by tidal forces between the galaxy's black hole and the Milky Way's black hole. The scientists concluded that dark matter interacts with dark matter similarly to how ordinary matter interacts with dark matter. Thus, they were looking for the influence of **Nchumu wa ntima** (dark matter)."
Van’wasayense va vone nchumu wa yini eka leswi landzelalaka?,"The correct answer is **D: Xirimela xa Sagittarius na Milky Way**.

The passage states that the study focused on the interaction between the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy and the Milky Way. The scientists observed that the Milky Way exerts tidal forces on the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, similar to how the Moon affects the Earth.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini leswi nga riki swi xopaxopiwa hi lava nga ni mavonelo ya vona?","The correct answer is **B: Ku pfumaleka ka matshalatshala ya mpfuxeto**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that critics focused on ""matshalatshala ya mpfuxeto lama lavaka ku nyika tikontiraka ta mpfuxeto eka lava tekiwaka va le vatirhi va le ndzeni ka Washington."" This means the critics **were** scrutinizing who was getting the reconstruction contracts.

* The passage also states that the critics were scrutinizing ""nkwetlembetano wa mali leyi tirhisiweke ni ku akiwa vuntshwa"", which means the critics **were** scrutinizing the money spent.

* The critic's label, """"Nxaviselo Lowuntshwa wa Bush le New Orleans"""" also criticizes the use of money on reconstruction.

* The passage does not mention a lack of effort in the reconstruction, but rather focuses on *how* the reconstruction efforts were being carried out (i.e., who was benefiting from the contracts).

Therefore, the critics were NOT criticizing **B: Ku pfumaleka ka matshalatshala ya mpfuxeto** (Lack of reconstruction efforts)."
I mani la nga xopaxopa mpfuxeto wa tikontiraka eka matshalatshala ya ku pfuna Bubutsa ra Katrina?,"The correct answer is **B: Lava lwelaka ntshunxeko**.

The passage explicitly states that ""Ku xopaxopa ka lava lwelaka ntshunxeko ka matshalatshala ya mpfuxeto..."" (The criticism of libertarians on the reconstruction efforts...). Therefore, the libertarians are the ones criticizing the reconstruction contracts.

"
I yini leswi eBay yi lavaka ku swi fikelela hi leswi nga xaviwa?,"The correct answers are **A, B, and C.** Here's why:

*   **A: Ku hlanganisa mali leyi nghenaka (To consolidate income)** The passage mentions that eBay hopes to expand its revenue streams.

*   **B: Ku ya eka tindhawu letintshwa (To go to new places)** The passage explicitly says the acquisition is to expand into regions where Skype is strong, such as China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil.

*   **C: Ku kurisa xiyimo xa yona (To grow its position)** The passage states that the company believes the acquisition will make it more prominent in countries where Skype has power.

*   **D: Ku enerisa lava ku nga endliwa bindzu na vona (To satisfy those who have done business with them)** While acquisitions can sometimes indirectly benefit partners, this isn't the primary reason stated in the passage.

Therefore, the best answer is to select **A, B, and C.**"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i va mani lava nga tihlanganisaka ni vabohiwa lava nga sala ejarateni endzhaku ka ku lwa?","The correct answer is **A: Vakanerisi**.

The passage states, ""Vakanerisani va ringete ku lulamisa xiyimo xexo..."" which translates to ""Negotiators tried to resolve the situation..."" This indicates that negotiators engaged with the remaining prisoners in the yard.
"
I yini eku heteleleni leswi nga vanga leswaku vabohiwa va tshika hasahasa?,"The correct answer is **B: Gasi yo humesa mihloti**.

The passage states that after negotiations failed, officers in riot gear entered the yard and sprayed tear gas on the prisoners. This action is what ultimately subdued the prisoners and presumably ended the disturbance.
"
"Hi ku ya hi vonelo ra Ali Khamenei, tiko ra Iran ri fanele ri ti ntshuxa eka yini?","The correct answer is **D: Ku tirhisiwa ngopfu ka oyili**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that ballot counting is done by **volunteers** who are watched closely, not by representatives of the candidates.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mabokisi ya tivhoti ma fanele va vonikela:** The text explicitly states that ballot boxes must be transparent.
*   **B: Vayimeri lava rhumeriwaka hi lava vhoteriwaka:** The text mentions that candidates can send representatives to observe the process.
*   **C: Ku sayina buku ya lava nga vhota:** The text mentions that voters must sign the voter list.

"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, Allen u hete nhlayo leyikulu ya mali ya yena eka yini?","The correct answer is **B: Vuvalangi bya le matini**

The passage states: ""Un’wana wa vanhu vo fuma swinene laha misaveni, Allen u endle vuvekisi bya rifuwo ro tala ra yena eka vuvalangi bya le matini..."" This directly says Allen invested a large portion of his wealth in underwater exploration.

The passage states ""Valawuri va ehleketa leswaku leswi swi kombisa leswaku switameri leswi nga ni **petirolo ya yureniyamu** eka xivandla xexo swi nga ha va swi phandlukile ivi swi pfuta."" This indicates that the uranium fuel is the suspected cause of the dangerous situation.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki switsundzuxo swa vuhlayiseki leswi nga ringanyetiwa eka vaaki endzhaku ka xiendlakalo xa le ka vumaki?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku papalata ku hefumula musi wo basa**.

The passage states that ""white smoke"" was seen coming from the factory. While it's implied that avoiding the smoke is wise, it wasn't explicitly stated as a *recommendation* to the public. The recommendations that WERE explicitly stated are:

*   Don't go outside
*   Turn off air conditioners
*   Don't drink tap water
"
"Hi ku ya hi Dr.Moll, i yini leswi karhataka ngopfu hi XDR-TB?","The correct answer is **D: Nhlayo leyikulu ya vanhu lava faka (The high number of people who are dying)**.

The passage states: ""Dok. Tony Moll u kume Extremely Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) endhawini ya KwaZulu-Natal le Afrika Dzonga. Eka mbhurisano, u vule leswaku muxaka lowuntshwa a **""""wu karhata swinene ni ku chavisa hikwalaho ka nhlayo leyikulu ya vanhu lava faka.""""**""  This directly translates to Dr. Moll stating the high number of deaths is what is most concerning and frightening about the new strain.
"
I vavabyi va ngani lava nga tluleteriwa hi muxaka lowuntshwa lava ku nga tiyisisiwa leswaku i vatirhi va rihanyo?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The passage states NextGen ""yinyika muchayeri wa xihaha mpfhuka vuxokoxoko lebyi tiyeke ngopfu,"" which translates to ""gives the pilot more precise information."" This directly relates to more precise aircraft locations for air traffic controllers.

The other options are benefits that stem from that precision, but the question asks what benefits air traffic controllers directly."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, van’wamatimu a va solanga FBI hi ku dzika eka yini?","The correct answer is **A: Ku pfuneta ku humelela**.

The passage states that historians criticized the FBI for targeting resources towards easily solvable cases like stolen vehicles to help the success of the section itself. This implies they criticized the FBI *for* facilitating success, not that they didn't criticize the FBI for it. The other options are directly mentioned as criticisms.
"
Goza ra leswi yirisiwaka ri sindzisa FBI leswaku yi endla yini?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku nyika vatirhi va ndzawulo milandzu ya swifaniso swa vanhu lava kuleke lava nga ambalanga leswaku va navetisa**.

The passage states that the group wants the FBI to provide 10 agents to oversee ""indecent images of adults"". This directly translates to option D. The act of overseeing in this case implies working with the cases, meaning the agents would be assigned to those specific cases.
"

"Endzhaku ka ku tlumbana ka JAS 39C Gripen, rivala ra xihaha-mpfhuka ri pfariwile hikwalaho ka yini?","The correct answer is **A: Swihahampfhuka leswi tolovelekeke**.

The text states that ""rivala ra swihahampfhuka ri pfaleriwa swihahampfhuka leswi tolovelekeke"" after the crash. This directly answers the question of why the airport was closed.

*   **A: U sungule ku tlangela Partizan hi 1945** - This is **TRUE**. The passage states, ""U hlangane na vona hi 1945 naswona u tshame ku fikela 1958.""
*   **B: U tlangele Zagreb a nga si ya eka Partizan Belgrade** - This is **TRUE**. The passage states, ""Edorobeni nkulu ra Croatia, Zagreb, Bobek u kume ndhuma loko a tlangela Partizan Belgrade."" This implies that he gained recognition while playing for Partizan Belgrade, and the first part of the sentence states where he came from, which is Zagreb.
*   **C: U tlangele Partizan ku fikela hi 1995** - This is **FALSE**. The passage states he stayed with the team ""ku fikela 1958"" (until 1958).
*   **D: U kume ndhuma endzhaku ka ku vhotheriwa tanihi mutlangi wo swikota ngopfu eka Partizan** - This is **FALSE**. The passage states he ""kume ndhuma loko a tlangela Partizan Belgrade"" (gained recognition while playing for Partizan Belgrade) and that he was ""hlawuriwe tanihi mutlangi wo swikota ngopfu eka matimu ya Partizan"" (voted as the best player in Partizan's history) in 1995.

Therefore, options A and B are correct.

Final Answer: **A and B**
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i xihlawulekisi xihi lexi hambanisaka Hesperonychus eka Velociraptor?","The correct answer is **B: Yi na nw’ala lowu kuleke**.

The passage states that Hesperonychus had a second claw that was enlarged, which is why it was named ""Hesperonychus"" meaning ""western claw"". While the passage notes Hesperonychus is *related* to Velociraptor, it implies the enlarged claw is a key characteristic, whereas the other options are described as shared characteristics.
"
Nhlamuselo ya “Hesperonychus” yi huma eka xihlawulekisi xihi xa miri wa swivumbiwa?,"The correct answer is **A: N'wala kumbe min’wala**

The passage specifically states that ""Hesperonychus"" means ""western claw"" and is named after the enlarged second claw.

"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini swa ku sungula leswi nga karhata valawuri malunghana ni Luno?","The correct answer is **C: Ku halaka ka mafurha (The spilling of oil)**

The passage states: ""...naswona ekusunguleni varhangeri a va chava leswaku swi ta halaka."" This directly translates to ""...and initially the leaders were afraid that it would spill."" The ""it"" refers to the fuel oil (mafurha) mentioned earlier in the passage.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka malunghana ni ku tshoveka ka Luno leswi nga riki ntiyiso?","Let's analyze each statement based on the provided text:

*   **A: Ku tshoveka ku humelele ku nga si landziwa ndzhwalo:** The text states ""Xikepe lexi nga 100-mithara lexi a xi nghene endleleni ku ya teka ndzhwalo wa manyorho..."" This implies the ship was *on its way* to pick up cargo (manyorho) when the incident occurred. Therefore, this statement is likely **TRUE**.

*   **B: Xikepe a xi ri ni 100 wa timithara ta mafurha hi nkarhi wa ku tshoveka:** The text states the ship had ""120–160 cubic metres ya mafurwa"". The statement suggests it had 100 meters of oil. This is clearly a different unit of measurement. Therefore, this statement is **FALSE**.

*   **C: Eka swirho swa ntlawa swa lava nga khume-mbirhi, i un’we la nga vaviseka:** The text says ""Swihaha mpfhuka swi ponise khume mbirhi wa swirho swa ntlawa naswona ku tshoveke nhompfu ntsena."" This translates to, helicopters saved twelve crew members, and only the bow broke. This indicates that nobody was harmed, contradicting the statement that one member of the crew got injured. Therefore, this statement is **FALSE**.

*   **D: Xikepe xi bakanyiriwile eka khumbi ro sivela:** The text states ""...mimoya leyi baka ngopfu na magandlati lama yisiweke eka khumbi ro ya sivela."" This confirms that the waves were pushed against a protective barrier. Therefore, this statement is **TRUE**.

**Conclusion:**

The statements that are *not* true (False) are B and C. Therefore the answer is: B and C."
Hi le ka khume ra malembe wahi laha Algeria yi nga kuma ntshunxeko?,"The correct answer is **C: Hi va 1960** because the passage states ""Eka va 1960 u vuyele eAlgeria leyi a yi ya ha ku kuma ntshuxeko...""

The passage states: ""Rugby, kahlekahle yuniyoni ya rugby, na golufu ti hlawuriwile eka mintlhangu yin’wana ya ntlhanu leyi nghenelelaka eka Tiolimpiki."" This clearly indicates that yuniyoni ya rugby was voted to be included. The other options are mentioned as sports that tried to get in, but were not chosen.

Hi kwalomu ka tidolara tingani ta tibiliyoni leti Guinness yi ti nghenisaka hi lembe?,"The correct answer is **C: 14**.

The passage states that Guinness generates ""ku tlula 10 ta tiyuro (US$14.7 wa tibiliyoni)"" which translates to ""more than 10 billion euros (US$14.7 billion)."" Therefore, $14.7 billion is closest to the choice of $14 billion.

The passage states that ""Furwa i tiko ra vunkombo ematikweni lama nga ehansi ka Ntwanano wa Yuropa leri hlaseriweke hi xitsongwatsongwana lexi"".
"
Hi le kwihi la ku nga va ni xiviko xa le ndzhaku xa ku kumiwa ka xitsongwatsongwana xa H5N1?,"The correct answer is **A: E Furwa**.

The passage states that the dead wild weasel infected with H5N1 was found ""in a marsh area near Lyon in eastern France.""
"
Haiti yi hetelele rini ku va ni swiphiqo swa vuvabyi ku nga si hangalaka vuvabyi lebyi nga tisiwa hi vanhu vo tisa kurhula?,"The correct answer is **A: Hi va 1800**.

The passage states: ""Ku nga si fika masocha, Haiti a yi nga si tshama yi va na swiphiqo swa vuvabyi ku sukela kwalomu ka va 1800."" This directly answers the question.
"
I thyaka leri humaka eka ndhawu yihi leri nga hoxa xandla eka ku hangalaka ka vuvabyi?,"The correct answer is **B: Etikampeni ta masocha ya le UN**.

The passage states, ""Hikuya hi vanhu va nawu, thyaka ra ti kampa ta UN ari nga basisiwanga kahle, ri endle leswaku switsongwatsongwana swi nghena eka xitsundzuxo xa Artibonite River..."" which directly links the waste from UN soldier camps to the spread of the disease.
"
Mfumo wa le Ireland wu kunguhata ku endla yini?,"Based on the passage, the Irish government is urged to address a constitutional issue related to a drug law. The Minister for Health is concerned about the safety of people using drugs under this law and the drug-related crimes that have occurred since the law was enacted.

Therefore, the government is expected to fix the existing law that is considered unconstitutional. The passage does not suggest the Irish government will give drug users charges, create more strict laws to legalize drug use, or decriminalize drugs.

Thus, the correct answer is **C: Ku olovisa milawu ya ku pfumeleriwa ka swidzidzirisi** (To simplify the laws of allowing drugs).
"
I yini leyi a yi pfumeleriwa hi nawu hi xinkarhana le Ireland?,"The correct answer is **D: Swidzidzirisi** (Drugs).

The passage mentions that the Minister of Health expressed concern about the safety of people using the temporary law and the drugs involved, and about drug offenses that have occurred since the laws were changed. This clearly indicates that the temporary law concerns drugs.
"
Muhehliwa wu le ku kambisisiweni hikwalaho ka yini?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku nghena emutini wa un’wana handle ka mpfumelelo** (Trespassing). The text explicitly states that the suspect is being investigated for trespassing, not for vandalism.
"
"Loko a cinca mfungho, i yini leswi muhehliwa a nga swi endla?","The passage states that the suspect used black tarpaulins decorated with peace signs and hearts to change the ""O"" into a lowercase ""e"". Therefore, the best answer is **D: U tirhise ti tarpaulin ku wu cinca** (He used tarpaulins to change it).

Here's why the other options aren't as good:

*   **A: U cince yin’we ya maletere** (He changed one of the letters) - While true, this is a very general statement. Option D is more specific about *how* he changed the letter.
*   **B: U khavise hi mfungho wa ku rhula** (He decorated it with a peace sign) - This is part of what he did, but not the main action related to changing the sign.
*   **C: U onhe hi mavoko** (He damaged it by hand) - The passage specifically says the sign wasn't damaged."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi mudyondzisi wa Xinghezi Karno a nga hehliwanga hi swona?","The correct answer is **B: Ku rhandzana ni xichudeni (Having a romantic relationship with a student)**.

The passage mentions the following accusations against Karno:

*   Using offensive language in notes and class.
*   Placing unauthorized advertisements.
*   Claiming to be the best English teacher.
*   Violating copyright laws.

It *doesn't* mention him having a romantic relationship with a student. Therefore, that's the accusation he wasn't charged with according to the text."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mani loyi a nga tlhakisiwanga hi Rolando Mendoza?","The correct answer is **B: Maphorisa**.

The passage states that Rolando Mendoza hijacked a bus of tourists from Hong Kong. It also mentions Filipino photographers being released early. The passage mentions that some of those kidnapped are children, which supports that the children were kidnapped. Thus, Maphorisa, meaning police, are the only option that wasn't taken hostage."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, eka lava tlhakisiweke i vahi lava a ku nga tiyisisiwanga leswaku va ntshunxiwe ku nga si fika nkarhi?","The correct answer is **A: Vapfhumba**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""vapfhumba"" (tourists) were initially kidnapped.
*   It then mentions that some hostages, including children and adults, were released early. Filipino photographers were also released early.
*   The passage doesn't directly say whether all ""vapfhumba"" were released early. It mentions that several of the hostages survived and six died. Therefore, it's not confirmed that all ""vapfhumba"" were released early.
* It is not mentioned whether or not the children and adults had already been vapfhumba."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mani la nga hlengeleta minsayino ya ku seketela ku endla vukati bya vanhu va rimbewu rin’we byi va enawini le Brazil?","The correct answer is **A: Vakombisakuvilela**.

The passage states: ""Vakombisakuvilela va tshemba leswaku va ta hlengeleta xikombelo xa vona xa minsayino ya 1.2 miliyoni ku xi yisa eka Huvo ya Tiko hi Hukuri."" This directly indicates that ""Vakombisakuvilela"" are the ones collecting signatures.
"
Vakombisakuvilela va ta nyika mani xikombelo xa vona?,"The correct answer is **C: Huvo ya Tiko ya Brazil**.

The passage states: ""Vakombisakuvilela va tshemba leswaku va ta hlengeleta xikombelo xa vona xa minsayino ya 1.2 miliyoni ku xi yisa eka **Huvo ya Tiko** hi Hukuri.""
"
"Hi ku ya hi xiviko xa Armand Versace, i yini leswi nga humelela hi ku kongoma vanhu va nga si sungula ku angula eka maxelo?","The correct answer is **C: A ku ri ni moya lowukulu** (There was a strong wind).

Here's why:

*   The passage describes a sequence of events: first a 5-minute warning, then strong winds reaching 70km/h, then rain, and finally hail. The question asks what happened *directly before* people started reacting to the weather. The text says that people began to panic (chuwa and huwelela) when the hail started. Therefore, what happened directly before people reacted was the strong wind.
*   The other options are incorrect because:
    *   A: Xihangu (hail) is what *caused* the reaction, not what happened before it.
    *   B: The 5-minute warning happened before everything else and wasn't related to the immediate reaction.
    *   D: U lahlekeriwe hi xirho xa ndyangu (He lost a family member) happened later in the timeline after people had already reacted."
"Hi ku ya hi Versace, mimoya leyikulu swinene yi sungule rini?","The correct answer is **A: Timinete to hlayanyana endzhaku ka nkombiso**.

The passage states: ""Eka timinete ta ntlhanu ta ku kombisa ku sungula ka moya lowukulu..."" which translates to ""Five minutes into the show the strong wind started...""
"
"Emahlweni ka Fred, i mabubutsa mangani lama nga rhekhodiwa evuxeni bya 35°W?","The answer is **C: Mambirhi**.

The passage states that Fred is ""the third strongest hurricane ever recorded east of 35°W."" This implies that there were two other hurricanes recorded east of 35°W before Fred.
"
"Loko Fred yi ri ekusuhi ni swihlala swa le Cape Verde, xana a yi kongome ka tlhelo rihi?","The correct answer is **D: En’walungu vupeladyambu**

The passage states ""Fred sweswi yi ni moya lowu fambaka hi rivilo ra 105 wa timayili hi awara (165 km/h) naswona **yi kongome en’walungu vupeladyambu**.""
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga ni rivilo swinene ku tlula xo sungula?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**

Here's why:

The passage states that 802.11n has a speed of up to 600Mbit/s, making it faster than the original standard.
"
I yini lexi lavekaka leswaku 802.11n yi fambisana ku tlhelela endzhaku na 802.11b?,"The correct answer is **D: Tirhadiyo timbirhi**.

The passage states: ""...Sweswo swi ta wu pfumelela ku fambisana na 802.11a, 802.11b na 802.11g, **ntsena loko xitichikulu xi ri ni tirhadiyo hatimbirhi.**""
"
Hi le ka swiendlakalo swingani laha nhenha ya ti Olimpiki leyi kumeke ti medali ta nsuku a yi fanele yi ya hlambela eka Mintlango ya Commonwealth?,"The correct answer is **B: Swinharhu**.

The passage states the athlete was supposed to swim in:

1.  100m freestyle
2.  200m freestyle
3.  A relay race
"
Ha yini nhenha ya ti Olimpiki leyi kumeke ti medali ta nsuku a yi nga swi koti ku nwa maphilisi ya xona hikwalaho ka xitlhavi?,"The correct answer is **C: A karhateka hileswaku ma ta khumba ku faneleka ka miri wa yena hi ndlela yo biha**.

The passage states that the pills were banned in the sports, indicating that they could affect eligibility due to doping regulations.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini leswi nga ha va ka swi vange ku pfilunganyeka malunghana ni xiendlakalo xa ku tsekatseka ka misava?","The correct answer is **A: Ku va kona ka mapapa ya munyama**.

The passage states: ""Mapapa ya munyama lama nga fambisaniki na vholkheno ya voniwile emasungulweni ya ntshava. Mapapa a ya lava ku endla swi tika ku vona loko kuve ni ku buluka."" This indicates that the presence of dark clouds made it difficult to determine if an eruption (related to the earthquake) was occurring, thus causing confusion.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ku cinca lokukulu ku humelele rini?","The correct answer is **C: Hi March 10** (On March 10).

The passage states: ""Ku tseka tseka ka misava loku ku tiseke ku cinca lokukulu ku endleke hi March 10..."" which directly translates to ""The earthquake that caused the significant changes occurred on March 10...""
"
I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka malunghana na xilo lexi xa ku ya en’wetini xa Chandrayaan-1 leswi nga riki ntiyiso?,"The correct answer is **D: Xitirhisiwa xa ku ya en’wetini a xi pendiwile ematlhelweni (The impactor was painted on the sides)**.

Here's why:

* **P** states the Indian flag was painted on **all** sides of the impactor, but **D** states the impactor was painted on **the sides**

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage **P**:

*   **A: Xitirhisiwa xa ku rhendzeleka n’weti xi fambise xitirhisiwa xa ku ya en’wetini na ntlawa (The orbiter carried an impactor module and payload):** Passage states ""Switirhisiwa swa kuya eka n’weti handle ka muchayeri Chandrayaan-1 swi cukumete Moon Impact Probe (MIP)"". The term ""xitirhisiwa xa ku rhendzeleka n'weti"" refers to the Chandrayaan-1 orbiter. The term ""xitirhisiwa xa ku ya en'wetini"" refers to the Moon Impact Probe (MIP).
*   **B: Xitirhisiwa xa ku ya en’wetini a xi ri na switirhisiwa swa nkoka (The impactor contained a payload):** Passage states ""Handle ka ku rhwala switirhisiwa swa sayense"". This supports **B**.
*   **C: Ku huma ka xitirhisiwa xa ku ya en’wetini ku fambe kahle (The impactor's exit was successful):** Passage states ""naswona yi tlumbeke kahle kusuhi na nsika ya le dzongeni wa N’weti"" which indicates success.

Therefore, only **D** is not true based on the provided passage."
I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi hlamuselaka hi ku kongoma xitirhisiwa xa ku ya en’wetini?,"Based on the information provided in statement P, the correct answer is **B: Ku tlumbetiwa ka xona ku ve loku humelelaka**.

Here's why:

*   **Statement P** specifically states that the Moon Impact Probe (MIP) ""yi tlumbeke kahle"" which translates to ""it crashed successfully"". This confirms that the crashing, or impact, was successful.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Xi fike kahle ekusuhi na nsika ya le n’walungu wa N’weti** - Statement P says it crashed near the *south* pole, not the north pole.
*   **C: Xi humesiwe eka xitirhisiwa xa ku ya en’wetini leswi nga ni ntlawa wa vanhu** - Statement P says the mission was *unmanned* (""handle ka muchayeri"" meaning ""without a driver"" or ""unmanned"").
*   **D: A xi rhwale switirhisiwa swimbirhi swa nkoka** - Statement P only indicates that it carries scientific payloads and a painting of the Indian flag, but not specifically *two* important devices."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i magoza mahi ya nsirhelelo lama nga ta tirhisiwa ra ku hetelela ku lwisana ni vuvabyi?","The correct answer is **C: Mintlhavelo ya encephalitis yo sivela mavabyi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Timiliyoni ti nga ri tingani ta mintlhavelo yo sivela mavabyi yi tshembisiwile hi hulumendhe..."" This indicates that vaccines are a measure being implemented to combat the disease.
*   The measures mentioned in the passage are:
    1.  Slaughtering pigs
    2.  Distributing mosquito nets
    3.  Insecticides
    4.  Vaccines

Since the question is which one is the last resort, the answer is C."
Vuvabyi byi tlulela njhani eka vanhu?,"The correct answer is **C: Tinguluve**.

The passage states that the disease is carried by pigs, which transmit it to humans via mosquito bites.
"
Ku tsandzeka ka xigwevo xa vumbirhi ku nga va ni vuyelo byihi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku kuma mfanelo eka vumundzuku ya ti yuniyoni leti yimelaka ku hlangana ka rimbewu leri fanaka hi swa masangu**.

The passage states that the failure of the second sentence, which proposed to end unions representing same-sex couples, *could* open the door for those unions in the future. This directly supports option B.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ha yini xigwevo xa vumbirhi xi susiwile?","The answer is **A: Hi nkarhi wa nhlangano wa ku veka milawu**.

The passage states that the removal of the second sentence ""originated with the House of Representatives and passed in the same way in the Senate Monday."" This implies the change happened during the legislative process as the bill was being considered by the House and Senate.
"
I mani loyi ku nga paluxiwa “Panama Papers” eka yena?,"The correct answer is **B: Swihaxa mahungu**.

The passage states the ""Panama Papers"" were disclosed to the news media in 2016.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mani loyi swihaxa mahungu swa le Britain swi nga vula leswaku a fambisa tikhamphani to tala ku tumbeta rifuwo?","The correct answer is **C: Bangi ya Deutsche**

The passage states: ""Phephahungu ra le Brithani ku nga The Guradian ri ringanyete leswaku Deutsche Bank yi lawula kwalomu ka n’wexanharhu xa tikhampani leti nga tiviwiki ta 1200 ku endla sweswo."" This directly says that The Guardian suggested Deutsche Bank controlled a large number of shell companies.
"
I tinghozi tihi ta swihaha-mpfhuka eka leti landzelaka laha ku feke vanhu vo tala?,"The correct answer is **A: Nghozi ya xihaha-mpfhuka lexi a xi ya le Armenia xi suka eIran**.

The passage states that this accident resulted in 168 fatalities, which is the largest number of deaths mentioned for any single accident in the text.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki xivangelo xa ku tala ka tinghozi ta swihaha-mpfhuka leti nga humelela le Iran?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku pfumaleka ka mali ya ku pfumelela ku xaviwa ka swihaha-mpfhuka leswintshwa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that international sanctions **prevented** the purchase of new aircraft, not that Iran simply lacked the funds. The lack of funds may be a related issue, but the passage makes it clear that sanctions are the direct cause.
The other options are directly stated in the passage as contributing factors:

*   **A: Swihaha mpfhuka swa khale swo famba hi vanhu ni swa nyimpi (Old civilian and military aircraft)**: Directly mentioned as a problem.
*   **C: Milawu yo xupula ya matiko leyi nga tiyisekise leswaku swihaha-mpfuka leswintshwa a swi nge xaviwi (International sanctions ensuring new aircraft cannot be purchased)**: A direct cause of the inability to replace old aircraft.
*   **D: Ku nga hlayisiwi kahle ka swihaha-mpfhuka (Poor maintenance of aircraft)**: Directly mentioned as a problem."
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga katsiwanga eka xiviko xa Iraq Study Group?,"The correct answer is **B: Xitiviso xa ku ri loko ku ri ni ku cinca kun’wana, madzolonga lama engetelekaka le Iraq ma nga papalatiwa**

Here's why:

*   **A: Ku xopaxopiwa ka pholisi leyi nga kona:** The passage states, ""Xiviko xi xopaxopa swinene xa nkoka swinene xiyenge xin’wana ni xin’wana xa pholisi leyi nga kona ya Varhangeri eka Iragi..."" (The report is highly critical of every aspect of current leaders' policies in Iraq).
*   **C: Swibumabumelo swa ku sirhelela mindzilakana ya Iraq:** The passage states, ""Xo sungula eka swibumabumelo swa 78 hi leswaku ku fanele ku tekiwa goza lerintshwa ra vudipulomati ku nga si hela lembe ku sirhelela mindzilakana ya Iraq eka minhlaselo yo biha..."" (The first of 78 recommendations is that new diplomatic action should be taken within the year to protect Iraq's borders from attacks).
*   **D: Xikombelo xa ku simekiwa ka ntwanano eUnited States:** The passage states, ""Xiviko xi rhanga hi xikombelo xo va ni nkanerisano wa mani na mani hi ku simekiwa ka ntwanano eUnited States malunghana ni pholisi ku ya eMiddle East."" (The report begins with a request for public discourse on establishing consensus in the United States regarding policy toward the Middle East).

The passage explicitly states that the report *does not* offer any guarantee that any action will stop the sectarian conflict or increased violence. Therefore, option B is what is *not* included in the Iraq Study Group's report."
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga khuthaziwi hi Iraq Study Group eka xiviko xa yona?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku nga vuriwa xitiyisekiso xa ku heta madzolonga lama engetelekaka**

The passage states the Iraq Study Group ""lemukisa leswaku ku hava loyi a nga nyikaka xitiyisiso xa leswaku goza rihi ni rihi ra Iraq sweswi ri ta ... yimisa nkwetlembetano wa mpambukwa, madzolonga lama engetelekaka, kumbe mboyamelo wo pfuxa hasahasa"". This implies they are advising against *expecting* a guarantee of ending the violence. The other options are all directly mentioned as recommendations or encouragements within the report.
"
"Hi ku ya hi maphorisa, i mani la nga tekiwa tanihi xandla xa Provenzano?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

The passage states: ""Maphorisa ma vule leswaku Lo Piccolo a ri na matimba swinene hikuva a a ri xandla xa Provenzano le Palermo...""
"
"Hi ku ya hi rungula leri nga nyikeriwa eka ndzimana, a ku ri yini xivangelo xa ku fa ka Falcone?","The correct answer is **A: U dlayiwile hi nkarhi wa nyimpi leyi a yi hlohloteriwa hi Riina**.

The passage states that Falcone was killed ""during the war instigated by Riina against the state.""
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki swin’wana swa masagwadi ya Hitoshi Saito?,"Leswi a swi ri swin'wana swa masagwadi ya Hitoshi Saito hi leswi landzelaka:

*   Muhluri wa ti medali ta nsuku timbirhi ta Tiolimpiki
*   Muleteri wa komiti ya All Japan Judo Federation

Leswi swi vula leswaku nhlamulo leyi nga riki ntiyiso eka leswi landzelaka i:

"
Hi le kwihi laha lwasaki a koteke ku balekela ku endla swihlambanyo?,"The correct answer is **B: E Nepal**.

The passage states: ""u balekeke vukati le Nepal"" which translates to ""he escaped marriage in Nepal"".
"
I mani la nga hlasela lwasaki?,"The correct answer is **C: Mbyana**.

The text in P specifically states: ""u hlaseriwile le Tibet hi mbyana leyi a yi ri ni rihuhu"" which translates to ""he was attacked in Tibet by a dog with rabies"".
"
Alonso u tshike rini mphikizano wa yena?,"The correct answer is **D: A nga si rhanga**.

The passage states: ""Michael Schumacher u tshike mphikizano wa yena **ku nga ri khale endzhaku ka Alonso**..."". This means Alonso retired *before* Schumacher.
"
I yini leswi nga vanga leswaku Schumacher a tshika mphikizano wa yena?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku onhaka ka sasipenixini ya movha**

The passage states: ""Michael Schumacher u tshike mphikizano wa yena ku nga ri khale endzhaku ka Alonso, hileswi sasipenixini a yi onhake eka tindhawu to tala hi nkarhi wa mphikizano.""
"
"Hi ku hi ndzimana, i ntirho wa mani ku ntshunxa vakhotsi?","The correct answer is **A: Mutirhela mfumo loyi a khomaka vanhu**.

The passage states that ""Mukhotsi u veke beyili, loko yi nyikiwa, ivi a endla swihehlo swi va ximfumo hi ku khotsa mutirhela mfumo."" This directly indicates that the officer in charge of booking and processing prisoners is responsible for setting bail (if applicable) and formally charging individuals. This process ultimately leads to their release.
"
"Hi ku ya hi xileriso xa nkarhinyana xa ku sivela lexi nga vuriwa eka ndzimana, vakhotsi va fanele va pfumeleriwa ku va na yini leswaku va khomiwa ku hundza tiawara ta 24?","The correct answer is **A: Beyili**.

The passage states that the prisoner is given bail, if granted, and then formal charges are filed. The temporary restraining order mandates release after 24 hours *unless* a court appearance is secured. Securing bail would necessitate a court appearance, thus overriding the order's 24-hour limit. The other options are not the primary reason to be kept beyond the 24-hour period under the temporary restraining order.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xivangelo lexi nga tirhisiwangiki ku hlamusela ku lwisana?","The correct answer is **C: Swikoxo leswi tlakukeke swa nhlawulo**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Makhombo ya vusirheleri:** The passage mentions ""sivela khombo ra vusirheleri eka nhlawulo wu’nwana,"" indicating security risks were a reason.
*   **B: Ku lwetana ka vumbiwa:** The passage refers to ""ku lwetana loku nga lavekiki,"" connecting the cessation of combat to constitutionality.
*   **D: Ku kanakana hi vumbiwa:** The passage explicitly states, ""Vadipulomati va vule leswaku va kume ku kanakana loku ringaneke eka vumbiwa bya Afghan ku twisisa ku lwetana loku nga lavekiki,"" indicating concerns about the constitutionality of the conflict.
*   **C: Swikoxo leswi tlakukeke swa nhlawulo:** The passage does not mention high election costs as a reason for ending the fighting.
"
Hikwalahokayini vatirhelamfumo va hetelele va langute ku lwisana ku nga laveki?,"The correct answer is **C: A ku ri ni ku kanakana hi vumbiwa** (There was doubt about the constitution).

The passage states: ""Vadipulomati va vule leswaku va kume ku kanakana loku ringaneke eka vumbiwa bya Afghan ku twisisa ku lwetana loku nga lavekiki."" This directly translates to diplomats finding sufficient doubt about the Afghan constitution to understand why the fighting was undesirable.
"
I mani loyi a phamelaka vukorhokeri bya vuavanyisi eka FATA?,"The correct answer is **B: Vayimeri va Politiki**.

The passage explicitly states that the ""Vayimeri va Politiki"" are responsible for delivering government and judicial services in FATA under Article 247 of the Pakistani Constitution.
"
Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki ntiyiso malunghana ni “Vayimeri va Politiki” va FATA?,"Xihlamulo lexi nga riki ntiyiso eka swivulwa leswi nyikeriweke hi **D: Va lawula tindhawu to karhi hi ku helela**.

Hi wihi nkutlunya lowu Emma Stone a langiweke eka wona?,"The correct answer is **C: Mutlangi wa Xisati wo Famba Emahlweni**

The passage states: ""Gosling na Stone va langiwile eka Mutlangi wo Famba Emahlweni havumbirhi."" This translates to ""Gosling and Stone were both nominated for Actor in a Leading Role.""
"
Hi wihi nkutlunya lowu filimi yi nga langiwangiki eka wona?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku Sasela Filimi ko Famba Emahlweni**.

The passage states ""Ku langiwa kun’wana ku katsa Xifaniso Lexi Fambaka Emahlweni, Mukongomisi, Sinemathogirafi, Vumaki Bya Swiambalo, ku Sasela Filimi, Nkutlunya wo Sungula, Vumaki bya Vuhumelerisi, ku Sasela Mpfumawulo, ku Pfanganisa Mpfumawulo ni ku Tlanga Exikirinini ko Sungula."" and ""Tinsimu timbirhi eka fililmi...ti langiwile eka risimu ro sungula ro famba emahlweni.""

Therefore the film was nominated for:
*   Xifaniso Lexi Fambaka Emahlweni (A)
*   Ku Sasela Mpfumawulo (C)
*   Risimu ro Rhanga ro Famba Emahlweni (D)

But was only nominated for Ku Sasela Filimi and not Ku Sasela Filimi ko Famba Emahlweni (B)."
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi yeke emahlweni xi tirha endzhaku ka ku tsekatseka ka misava?,"The correct answer is **D: xitichi xa gezi xa Niigata**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Naswona NHK yi vule leswaku xitici xa nyutliliya ya Kashiwazaki Kariwa eNiigata a byi tirha hi ntolovelo."" This translates to ""And NHK said the Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear power plant in Niigata was operating normally.""
*   The other options are incorrect because the passage mentions:
    *   reactors at the Shika plant being shut down (opposite of operating normally)
    *   Noto Airport being closed
    *   train lines being disrupted"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi onhakeke hikwalaho ka ku tsekatseka ka misava?","The correct answer is **D: xitichi xa Swihahampfhuka xa Noto**

The passage specifically states ""...naswona Xitici xa Swihaha Mpfhuka xa Noto xi pfariwile."" This means it was damaged and closed due to the earthquake. The other options are not as directly stated:

*   **A: Makaya yo karhi:** The passage mentions homes without water and electricity, indicating damage, but ""some homes"" is more directly supported.
*   **B: Ti-reactor timbirhi xa xitichi xa Shika:** The passage says the reactors *shut down*, not necessarily that they were *damaged*. This is a safety measure.
*   **C: Mapato yo karhi:** The passage mentions roads being damaged, but not by name."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka timhaka leti landzelaka hi yihi lexi nga katsiwangiki etsalweni leri?","The correct answer is **B: Xivangelo xa nyimpi ya 1967**.

The passage mentions the 1967 war as a reference point for borders, but it does not discuss the *reason* for the war itself. The other options (A, C, and D) are all explicitly mentioned as topics that will be discussed in the negotiations.
"

The passage states that ""Ma u hlule kahle eka ndlela yo hlohlotela leswaku ku va ni ntirhisano swin’we ni ntikokulu ra China,"" which means that Ma succeeded in promoting cooperation with mainland China. This helped him win the election.
"
"Hilaha swi boxiweke hakona eka xiyenge lexi, xana Carolyn Wilson a a tirhela mani a nga si suka edorobeni?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**.

The passage states: ""mindsyangu yo tala leyi katsekaka xikan’we-kan’we yi xiye leswaku Carolyn Wilson wa OHA a a yive tidipoziti ku khomisa ta vona"". This directly indicates that Carolyn Wilson belonged to OHA.
"
"Leswi ku saleke mimphikizano ya mune eka nguva leyi, i mani loyi a nga eka nomboro ya vumune eka Driver’s Championship?","Based on the provided text:

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i kangani laha vanhu va voneke ti-meteorite leti waka leti endzhaku ti vonakeke ti huma e-Mars?","The correct answer is **B: Ka ntlhanu**.

The passage states: ""Ku pfumeriwa leswaku i nkarhi vuntlhanu laha vanhu va xiyeke leswi tiyisisiweke leswaku i swilo swa Mars leswi weleke emisaveni.""
"
"Hilaha swi boxiweke hakona eka xiyenge, hi wihi ntiyiso malunghana ni maribye lama kumekeke ma huma e-Mars?","The correct answer is **D: Ku na 34 wa tona**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Eka ti-meteorites ta kwalomu ka 24,000 leti tiviwaka leti weleke emisaveni, i 34 wa tona ntsena leti ku tiyisekisiwaka leswaku ti huma eMars.""
*   The other options are incorrect based on the text."
Xana Schumacher u tshika rini ntirho?,"The correct answer is **B: Endzhaku ka ku hlula mphikizano wakwe wa vunkombo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Schumacher loyi a tshikeke ntirho hi 2006 endzaku ko hlula eka mphikizano wa Formula 1 ka nkombo..."" (Schumacher retired in 2006 after winning his seventh Formula 1 championship...)
"
Xana Massa u vaviseke rini?,"The correct answer is **D: Emahlweni ka nguva ya 2009**.

The passage states Massa was injured at the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix, and he would be out for the *season* of 2009.  Therefore, the injury happened *before* the 2009 season was over.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana lunghiselelo leri ri ta yi khumba njhani AOL?","The correct answer is **C: Nhlayo ya vatirhisi yi ta phikizana ni vatirhisi va Yahoo na Microsoft**.

The passage states that the combined number of Yahoo! and Microsoft service users will compete with AOL's customer base. This directly implies that AOL's user base will face competition from Yahoo! and Microsoft.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi swihi leswi nga tshukaka swi hela eku heleni ka lunghiselelo leri?,"The correct answer is **C: Ntshunxeko wa AOL wo hluvukisa vuxaviselo hi rivilo ra yona**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Leswi ku nga ni lunghiselelo leri, ntshunxeko lowu wu nga ha hela.""  This directly implies that a freedom AOL currently possesses will be curtailed due to the arrangement. The context is about AOL's ability to innovate and develop its IM offerings. Therefore, the freedom that is likely to end is its freedom to develop its services at its own pace.

Let's analyze the other options:

*   **A: Nhluvukiso wa inthanete lowu anameke eUnited States:** While increased competition *could* influence the broader internet landscape, the passage doesn't directly state this as a loss.
*   **B: Ku tirhisiwa ka vuxaviselo bya IM:** The passage suggests that IM usage will continue, even become more competitive, not end.
*   **D: Ku tirhisana ka Yahoo na Microsoft:** The passage indicates that Yahoo and Microsoft are already cooperating. The arrangement described is about AOL potentially facing increased competition because of this cooperation, not the end of the cooperation itself.
Therefore, the most logical and textually supported answer is **C**."
I vanhu vangani lava dlayiweke eka nhlaselo lava a va nga ri maphorisa?,"The correct answer is **C: 0**

Here's the breakdown:

*   The passage states that **two police officers** were killed.

Therefore, the answer is 0."
I mani loyi a vikeke muehleketeleriwa eka nhlaselo lowu?,"The correct answer is **A: Maphorisa**.

The passage states: ""Maphorisa ma vule leswaku va sola leswaku vahlohloteri va nyimpi va Daesh (ISIL) hi vona va endleke nhlaselo lowu."" (The police stated that they suspect Daesh (ISIL) militants were responsible for the attack.)
"
"Hikwalaho ka leswi Florida a ri langutiwa ri ri mfumo lowu nga nhenha, xana Mitt Romney u nyikiwe ku hlula kwihi?","The correct answer is **C: Vayimeri hinkwavo va mfumo**.

"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i tiphesente tingani ta tivhoti leti Gingrich a nga na tona eka nhlawulo lowukulu?","The correct answer is **B: 32 wa tiphesente**.

"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi a tshikeke ku va emphikizanweni wa nhlawulo endzhaku ka vuyelo bya nhlangano?","The correct answer is **B: Bachmann**.

The passage states that ""Bachmann... took the decision to end her campaign.""
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi a ndhundhuzeleke muyimeri un’wana endzhaku ka vuyelo bya nhlangano?","The correct answer is **B: Gingrich**.

The passage states that ""Gingrich u ndhundhuzele Santorum, kambe u holovele Romney"". This translates to ""Gingrich congratulated Santorum, but criticized Romney"". Therefore, Gingrich congratulated another candidate."
Hi yihi ndhawu yin’we ntsena laha nongonoko wu kombisiweke eka yona emahlweni ka 2015?,"The correct answer is **A: TogiNet Radio**.

The passage states: ""Khale swinene nongonoko lowu a wu haxiwa ntsena eka xitichi xa khale lexi tlangaka eka inthanete lexi vuriwaka TogiNet Radio...""
"
Xana switichi swi hlamusela leswaku nongonoko wu ve ni nkucetelo wihi?,"The passage states that the radio station describes the program as ""old-time radio shows with modern and humorous twists."" Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **A: Maendlelo lamantshwa**
*   **B: Maendlelo yo hlekisa**
*   **C: Maendlelo ya xikhale**

So the correct answer is a combination of A, B, and C. However, since we must choose only one, we must look at what the question is asking. The question is asking how the radio station describes the program's influence. All three (A, B, and C) are mentioned as describing the program, but none of them are mentioned as describing the program's *influence*.

However, the passage also mentions the program features ""voice actors who are new to the field, living in East Texas."" So, we can infer that the program is influenced by its location.

Therefore, the best answer is:

*   **D: Maendlelo ya ndhawu**"
I yini leswi David Headley a swi kumeke leswi eku heteleleni swi pfuneke eka nhlaselo wa masocha?,"The correct answer is **A: Rungula**.

The passage states: ""David Headley eka vuvalangi ni ku simekiwa u pfune eku tirheni ka pfhumba ra vavanuna va 10 lava a va hlome hi swibamu...""

This translates to ""David Headley through reconnaissance and establishment helped in executing the campaign of the 10 gunmen..."" The reconnaissance (vuvalangi) and establishment (simekiwa) provided *information* that was crucial to the attack.
"
Xana i vutleketli bya muxaka muni lebyi ntlawa wa masocha wu byi tirhiseke ku ya le Mumbai?,"The correct answer is **C: Xikepe** (Ship).

"
Hi wahi marito lama kombisaka kahle vuyelo bya ntlangu wa Nadal na Raonic le Brisbane Open lowu boxiweke eka xiyenge lexi?,"The correct answer is **A: Raonic u hlule Nadal**

The passage states, ""Ku nga ri khale u hluriwile hi Raonic eka Brisbane Open,"" which directly translates to ""He was recently defeated by Raonic at the Brisbane Open.""
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xiyimo xa ntlangu wa Nadal na Raonic a xi ri xihi endzhaku ka sevhe yo sungula?","The correct answer is **B: Nadal u hlule mikutlunya ya 76**.

The text states ""Nadal u kume 88% wa mikutlunya eka mikutlunya ya 76 yo hlula ntlangu eka sevhe yo sungula."" This means Nadal won 76 points in the first set.
"
Hi wihi nongonoko wa ririmi lowu nga katsiwangiki eka vuhaxi byinharhu lebyintshwa bya Naked News?,"The correct answer is **C: Xijapani**.

The passage states that Naked News already reported in English and Japanese *before* the new language programs were announced. The new programs are in Spanish, Italian, and Korean. Therefore, Japanese is not part of the *new* broadcasts.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi kwihi laha vuhaxi lebyintshwa bya Naked News byi nga taka byi nga kumeki kona?","The correct answer is **C: Titiyetha**.

The paragraph states that Naked News will start producing programs for television, the web (internet), and phones. It doesn't mention anything about theaters.
"
I vaphikizani vangani lava tsandzekeke ku heta Giant Slalom?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

The text states that ""45 eka 117 wa vatlangi eka Xihontlovila Slalom va tsandzekile eka ntlango,"" which translates to ""45 out of 117 competitors in Giant Slalom failed in the match.""
"
Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi kombisaka kahle vuyelo bya mimphikizano ya Mitlangu ya Vunhenha?,"Let's analyze each option based on the provided text:

*   **A: Eka mphikizano wa vumbirhi, Carpenado u hete emahlweni ka mutlangi wo skiya wa le Hungary** - This is incorrect. The text states Carpenado finished *behind* Gyöngyi Dani (the Hungarian skier) by 1:09.02 minutes.

*   **B: Vatlangi va skiya va 45 a va hetanga rhengu ra vona eka Giant Slalom** - This is correct. The text says that in the Giant Slalom, 45 out of 117 skiers failed to finish.

*   **C: Vatlangi vo tala va skiya va hete Giant Slalom ku tlula Slalom** - To answer this, we need to know how many finished each race. In Slalom, 36 out of 116 did not finish, implying that 80 finished. In Giant Slalom, 45 out of 117 did not finish, implying that 72 finished. So, more skiers completed the Slalom. The statement is therefore incorrect.

*   **D: Carpenado u hete a ri wa vukhume eka Slalom** - This is incorrect. Carpanedo had a ""Did Not Finish"" (DNF) result in Slalom. He finished tenth in the *Giant* Slalom.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B**."
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi NBA yi endleke xiboho xo xi yimisa?,"Nhlamulo leyi lulameke hi: **C: Mutlangi wihi ni wihi loyi a kumekeke a ri na COVID-19**

"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi vangeleke ku vilela ka NBA malunghana ni xitsongwatsongwana?","The correct answer is **D: Mutlangi wa Utah Jazz u kumiwe a ri ni xitsongwatsongwana** (A player from the Utah Jazz tested positive for the virus).

The passage states that the NBA's decision came after a Utah Jazz player tested positive for COVID-19. This is the direct cause mentioned in the text.
"
I mani loyi a huwiseke golo yo hlula ya Washington Capitals eka ntlangu wa vona na Atlanta Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **A: Nicklas Backstrom**.

The passage states: ""Mpfuneto wo rhanga wa Ovechkin madyambu wolawo a wu ri wa golo leyi hluleke ntlangu hi mutlangi loyi a sungula ku nghena Nicklas Backstrom"". This translates to: ""Ovechkin's first assist that night was on the game-winning goal by rookie Nicklas Backstrom"".
"
I mani loyi a huwiseke golo yakwe ya vu-60 ya nguva eka ntlangu wa Capitals vs. Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

The passage states that Ovechkin scored his 60th goal of the season in that game.
"
Hi rini laha bangi ya Northern Rock yi laveke mpfuno wa hulumendhe?,"The correct answer is **D: Hi nkarhi nkitsikitsi wa tihakelo ta mali leyi lombisiwaka hi bangi**.

The text states: ""Bangi ya Northern Rock yi kombele mpfuno hikwalaho ka leswi ku tshuburiweke leswaku yi hakerisiwe ntswalo lowu tlulaka mpimo wa mali leyi yi lombiweke yona hi 2007."" This directly links the request for government assistance to the period of high borrowing costs.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi hlamuselaka kahle ku tirhisana ka Virgin Group swin’we na bangi na Northern Rock?","The correct answer is **B: Virgin Group yi xave bangi endzhaku ka loko yi sungule ku lawuriwa hi hulumendhe**.  This is an incorrect statement. 
Virgin Group yi ringetile ku xava bangi LOKO YI SE YI LAWURIWA HI HULUMENDHE, kambe va bakanyiwile. Va hetelele va xave ""bangi ya kahle"" ya Northern Rock plc loko se yi avanyisiwile."
"Hilaha swi boxiweke hakona eka xiyenge lexi, hi rihi tiko leri khumbiwaka hi sayiniwa ka ntwanano wa maxelo wa Kyoto?","The correct answer is **A: United States**.

The passage states that the United States is the only developed country that has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol.
"
Khale ka hulumendhe ya Australia a yi ehleketa leswaku ku amukeriwa ka ntwanano wa Kyoto a ku ta onha yini?,"The correct answer is **B: Ikhonomi ya tiko**.

The passage states: ""...ku vuriwe leswaku ntwanano wolowo a wu ta onha ikhonomi tanihi leswi yi titshegeke swinene hi ku rhumela malahla eka matikomambe..."" which translates to ""...it was said that the agreement would damage the economy as it relies heavily on exporting coal to foreign countries...""
"
Vaduvuri va swiharhi a va hirhiwe ku nghenela nongonoko wihi?,"The correct answer is **D: Nongonoko wo hlota wa Sporting Shooters Association**.

"
Hi xihi xivulwa lexi nga kombisiki hi ku kongoma ndzingeto wo lawula switsotswana?,"Nhlamulo leyi faneleke hi: **C: Vaduvuri a va vekiwa tihloko hi vasirheleri**

Xivangelo:

*   **A:** Xi kombisa hi ku kongoma leswaku ndzingeto a wu kamberiwanga swinene.
*   **B:** Xi kombisa leswaku vaduvuri va amukerile ndzetelo, leswi nga susumetaka leswaku ku va na vukamberi.
*   **D:** Xi kombisa leswaku ku hlawuriwe vaduvuri, leswi nga kotaka ku pfuna eka ndzingeto wo lawula.
*   **C:** A xi vulavuli hi vukamberi, ku tlhokovetela kumbe ndzingeto wo lawula."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, ku avana ku kumiwe kwihi?","The correct answer is **B: Eka masalela ya le maribyeni**.

The passage states that the fossil evidence found in rocks indicates that the divergence occurred earlier than molecular evidence suggested. Therefore, the division was found in fossil remains in the rocks.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi endlekeke hi xihatla ku tlula leswi a swi languteriwile?","The correct answer is **B: Ku avana (Speciation/Divergence)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that fossil evidence suggests ""ku hambana ku endleke khalenyana ku tlula leswi a swi ehleketiwa hi vumbhoni bya timolekuli"" (divergence happened earlier than previously thought based on molecular evidence).  ""Khalenyana"" means earlier, which implies it happened more rapidly relative to what was previously believed.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Ku kumiwa ka masalela ya le maribyeni (Discovery of fossil remains):** While the discovery of fossils *led* to the realization about divergence, the discovery itself wasn't described as happening faster than expected.
*   **C: Ku kamberiwa ka vumbhoni bya molekhuli (Reviewing molecular evidence):** The passage indicates molecular evidence was used as a point of comparison, not that it was happening faster.
*   **D: Ndzavisiso le Rift Valley (Research in the Rift Valley):** This is just the location of the research and not something said to be happening faster."
I yini lexi mutlangi a faneleke ku xi endla ku lawula leswi endliwaka eka ntlangu wa vhidiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku fambisa xo lawula emoyeni** (Moving the controller in the air).

The passage states: ""Leswi swi ta endla vatlangi va lawula swilo leswi endliwaka eka mintlango ya vhidiyo hi ku fambisa xitirhisiwa emoyeni."" (This will allow players to control things that happen in video games by moving the device in the air.)
"
I yini lexi endliweke ku languteka tanihi rhimoti ya thelevhixini?,"The correct answer is **D: Xitirhisiwa xo lawula xa Nintendo Revolution**.

The passage states: ""Ku fana na rhimoti ya thelevhixini, switirhisiwa leswi swi tirhisa tinsensara timbirhi..."" This directly compares the Nintendo Revolution controller to a TV remote.
"
I yini lexi a xi nga boxiwanga eka xiviko xa sweswinyana xo huma eka vaviki va mahungu va le Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **B: Xihahampfhuka xi phatsame eÜrümqi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the plane was **denied** an emergency landing in Ürümqi. This means it didn't land there.
*   The passage confirms options A, C, and D: it mentions a bomb threat (A), diversion to Afghanistan (C), and reaching Kandahar (D)."
I yini lexi a xi nga boxiwanga eka xiviko xo rhanga xa vaviki va mahungu va Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **B: Xihahampfhuka xi a aleriwile ndhawu yo phatsama ya xilamulela mhangu**.

Here's why:

*   The first report by Xinhua stated that the airplane was hijacked.
*   The subsequent reports state that the airplane received a bomb threat and was diverted to Afghanistan and that it was denied an emergency landing in Ürümqi.
*   According to the question, the question only considers the initial report by Xinhua, which only stated that the airplane was hijacked.

Therefore, the only answer that was not mentioned in the initial report is B: Xihahampfhuka xi a aleriwile ndhawu yo phatsama ya xilamulela mhangu."
I yini leswi tivisiweke hi Sara Danius eka nongonoko wa xiyanimoya?,"The correct answer is **D: Komiti yi ta yimisa matshalatshala yo tihlanganisa na Bob Dylan**.

Sara Danius explicitly stated that the committee is no longer trying to contact Bob Dylan. The other options are incorrect based on the information in the passage.
"
I mani loyi swi nga kotekangiki ku n’wi fikelela?,"The correct answer is **D: Bob Dylan**.

The passage states that the Nobel Committee was unable to reach Bob Dylan directly to inform him about winning the Nobel Prize.
"
"""I mani loyi a vuleke leswaku xiboho xexo """"a ku ri pakani”?""","Nhlamulo leyi lulameke i **C: Gordon Johndroe**.

Leswi swi kombisiwa hi ku kongoma eka xitandzhaku: ""Muvulavuleri wa Bush ku nga Gordon Johndroe u vule xihlambanyo xa North Korea """"a ku ri pakani..."""".
"
Xana Slania u endle switempe swingani swa matiko you hambanahambana?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku tlula 2,000**

Here's why:

*   The passage states Słania made ""switempe swo tlula 1,000 swa Sweden na 28 swa matiko man’wana"" (over 1,000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries).
*   Therefore, the total number of stamps he made for the various countries is over 1,000 + 28, which is over 1,000
*   It is implied that he made more than 1000 stamps for the other 28 countries, if not close to it. This makes the total amount of stamps he engraved for the countries to be well over 2,000."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi lexi nga tshukaka xi vangele ku pfuta loku hambetaka ka timbhovo ta thangi?","The correct answer is **C: Ku ndlandlamuka ka nsimbi** (Expansion of metal).

The passage states ""Ku sukela hi Ravunharhu ninhlikanhi, timbhovo ta thangi a ta ha pfuka kumbexana hikwalaho ka ku kukumuka endzeni ka thangi."" This translates to ""As of Wednesday afternoon, the holes in the tank were still appearing likely due to bulging inside the tank."" Bulging of a tank is a direct result of metal expansion caused by the pressure and/or temperature.
"
Hikwalaho ka yini tiphayiphi ti pfulekile?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku ve na ku tsemeka ka gezi endzhaku ko kambela xitrhisiwa (There was a power outage following equipment inspection)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ku tsemeka ka gezi endzhaku ka ku kamberiwa loku tolovelekeke ka xo tima ndzilo ku vangela tiphayiphi leswaku ti pfuleka... (A power outage following a routine fire suppression system inspection caused the pipes to open...)""
"
"Sweswi, mati ma tlakuke ku fikela kwihi eka Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **C: Ku fika exisutini**.

The passage states: ""Ninth Ward, laha veke ni ndhambi ya 20 wa tifiti hi nkarhi wa Bubutsa ra Katrina, sweswi yi ni mati lama fikeke exisutini tanihi leswi mpimo wa le kusuhi wu taleke ku tlurisa."" This directly indicates the current water level in the Ninth Ward is at the level of the ankle.
"
"Hi nkarhi wa Bubutsa ra Katrina, ku endleke yini hi Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **C: Mati ya ndhambi a ma tlakuke 20 wa tifiti** (The flood waters were 20 feet high).

The passage states that the Ninth Ward ""experienced flooding of 20 feet during Hurricane Katrina.""
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga tiyisisiwangiki hi Hamilton?,"The correct answer is **B: Leswaku muvabyi a nga tshuka a ngheniwa hi xitsongwatsongwana** (That the patient may have been infected with the virus).

Here's why:

*   The passage states the patient came from Nigeria where some cases of Ebola were found. This implies a *possibility* of infection, not a confirmed infection. Hamilton confirmed the university hospital *admitted* the patient in stable condition, not that they *didn't* have Ebola.
*   The other options (A, C, and D) are either explicitly stated or heavily implied in the passage as being confirmed by Hamilton."
I nchumu wihi lowu va n’wasayense va lavaka ku wu twisisa?,"The correct answer is **D: Ndlela leyi Misava yi endliweke ha yona (How the Earth was made)**.

The passage clearly states that scientists want to understand ""ndlela leyi tipulanete ti endlekaka ha yona, ngopfu-ngopfu ndlela leyi misava yi sunguleke ha yona"" which translates to ""how planets are made, especially how the Earth began"".
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i xiphemu xihi lexi maphorisa ya ndhawu ma xi hetisiseke eku pfariweni?","The correct answer is **C: Va kongomise vachayeri va mimovha eka ndlela yin’wana**

The paragraph states that ""maphorisa ya 80 a va pfuna vanhu va nghena hi ndlela yin’wana,"" which means they directed drivers to alternate routes.
"
Ku endleke yihi hi vungheno bya tindlela ta chubu hi nkarhi wa ku pfariwa,"Based on the provided text, the answer is **A: A ti pfariwile.**

The text states that dump trucks were used to block entrances. This implies that all entrances, including those leading to subway roads, were closed.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga endlekangiki emahlweni ko va muteki wa swifaniso a chayisiwa hi movha?","The correct answer is **D: Muteki wa swifaniso u kote ku teka xifaniso xa Bieber**

Here's why:

*   **A, B, and C** are all mentioned in the passage as events that occurred before the photographer was hit by the car.
*   The passage never says that the photographer took a photo of Bieber. It only says that the photographer was trying to take pictures of police officers."
Xana muteki wa swifaniso a ringeta ku endla yini a nga si chayisiwa hi movha?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku teka swifaniso swa maphorisa lawa a ma yimile**.

The passage states: ""Webusayiti ya mahungu ya vuhungasi ya TMZ yi twe leswaku muteki wa swifaniso u yimise movha wakwe etlhelo ka Sepulveda Boulevard ivi a ringeta ku teka swifaniso swa maphorisa lawa a ma yime emahlweni ka patu leri tsemakanyaka ni ku ya emahlweni...""
"
Hi xihi xivulwa lexi nga xi hlamuseliki hi ku kongoma xiyimo xa muungameri endzhaku ko kumiwa a ri na xitsongwatsongwana?,"The correct answer is **A: A nga titwi kahle**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states the President *does* feel well (""ndzi titwa ndzi ri kahle"").
*   It also mentions he has a cold and a sore throat, and he is in good condition, and he looks forward to returning to all of his activities.

Therefore, stating that he doesn't feel well is the *only* statement that is *not* directly representative of the President's condition based on the passage."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi ta muungameri hi xihi lexi nga ntiyiso?","The correct answer is **C: U hanye kahle lerova a nga kota ku vulavula hi riqingho**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Handle ka mukhuhlwani na nkolo lowu vavaka, ndzi titwa ndzi ri kahle naswona ndzi le ka xiyimo xa kahle leswaku ndzi tirha hi riqhingho."" Which translates to “apart from a cold and sore throat, I feel good and I am in good condition to work on the phone.” This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: A nga na mukhuhlwani** - Incorrect. The passage says he *does* have a cold.
*   **B: U ta tshama ekaya mavhiki ma nga ri mangani** - Incorrect. The passage says he will stay home for ""masiku yo karhi"" (some days), and that he expects to return to work on Monday.
*   **D: Wa tikeriwa swinene hikwalaho ka xitsongwatsongwana** - Incorrect. The passage says he feels well apart from the cold and sore throat."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana Xidzedze xa Gonu a xi languteriwe ku ya emahlweni xi hunguteka rini?","The correct answer is **B: Loko moya wu hunguteka rivilo ku fika eka 83 wa tikhilomitara hi awara**.

The passage states that ""Namuntlha nimixo, mheho wa kona a wu ri kwalomu ka 83 wa tikhilomitara hi awara naswona ku languteriwe leswaku wu ya emahlweni wu hunguteka."" This directly translates to ""This morning, the wind speed was about 83 kilometers per hour and it was expected to continue to decrease."" Therefore, the expectation of further weakening began when the wind speed was at 83 km/h.
"
Xana mimoya a yi ri eka rivilo rihi loko Xidzedze xa Gonu xi fikelela nhlohlorhi ya xona?,"The correct answer is **C: 149 wa timayili hi awara**

The passage states: ""Enhlonhlorhini ya xona, Xidzedze xa Gonu, lexi thyiweke vito ra xirhundzu xa matluka ya cindzu hi ririmi ra le Maldives, xi fike eka mheho lowu hungaka hi rivilo ra 240 wa tikhilomitara hi awara (149 wa timayili hi awara)."" This directly says the peak wind speed was 149 miles per hour.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki mukhuva wa Karenia brevis?,"The correct answer is **C: Xi na tisele to hlaya**

Here's why:

*   **P** states that Karenia brevis is a ""xivumbiwa xa le matini lexi nga ni sele yin’we"" which translates to ""single-celled marine organism."" Therefore, it does **not** have multiple cells.
The remaining options are all attributes of Karenia brevis found in passage P."
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi Karenia brevis yi nga swi kotiki ku swi endla?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku andza hi xihatla eka swiyimo swihi na swihi** (To multiply quickly in any conditions).

Here's why:

*   **A: Ku onha misiha ya tinhlampfi** (To damage the nerves of fish): The passage states ""Nkuxu lowu wu endla tineurotoxin leti nga onhaka misiha eka vanhu ni tinhlampfi,"" meaning Karenia brevis DOES damage the nerves of fish through the toxins it produces.

*   **C: Ku kavanyeta mati:** (To disrupt the water) The passage states ""Ku cinca ka mati ma va yo tshwuka swi vangiwa hi ku andza loku tlulaka mpimo ka Karenia brevis.""

*   **D: Ku humesa neurotoxin** (To produce neurotoxins): The passage explicitly says ""Nkuxu lowu wu endla tineurotoxin..."" (This bloom produces neurotoxins).

*   **B: Ku andza hi xihatla eka swiyimo swihi na swihi** (To multiply quickly in any conditions): The passage states ""Swilo swa ntumbuluko swi nga kucetela swin’wana ivi swi vanga xiyimo lexinene lexi nga endlaka leswaku nkuxu lowu wu kula hi mpimo lowu hlamarisaka."" (Natural factors can influence certain things and cause a favorable condition that can cause this bloom to grow at an amazing rate.) Karenia brevis needs a favorable condition to multiply quickly, not any condition."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga vangiwangiki hi Xidzedze xa Felicia?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: Ku tala ka mati eswitarateni**.

The passage states that there were no reports of damage or flooding. Options A, B, and C are all mentioned as effects of the hurricane.
"
Hi xihi xivulwa lexi nga ntiyiso malunghana na Xidzedze xa Felicia?,"The correct answer is **C: Swihlala swo tala swi amukele mpfula.**

Here's why:

*   **A: Mpfula leyi neke yi pfune Oahu** The passage states the rainfall was described as ""beneficial,"" implying it helped Oahu.
*   **B: Eku sunguleni a yi tekiwa tanihi matimba ya xihuhuri xa thiropika ivi yi va xidzedze xa Xiyenge 4** The passage states the opposite; Felicia was initially a Category 4 hurricane and weakened into a tropical storm.
*   **C: Swihlala swo tala swi amukele mpfula** The passage explicitly says ""Its remnants brought torrential rainfall to several islands.""
*   **D: Mpfula yin’wana a yi fambisana ni rihati** The passage explicitly says ""Tin’wana ta timpfula leti a ti fambisana ni ku duma na ku hatima loku hambetaka""."
Hi xihi xivulwa lexi kombisaka kahle vuyelo bya 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix?,"Nhlamulo leyi lulameke i **C: Piquet Jr. u hlongoriwile endzhaku ka sweswo**

Leswi swi vula hi ku kongoma leswi swi vuriweke eka xivulwa P."
Xana khombo ro chayisa ri endleke rini?,"The correct answer is **A: Endzhakunyana ka loko Aloso wu yimile ku chela petirolo** (After Alonso's pit stop).

The passage states that Piquet Jr. crashed *after* Alonso's early pit stop.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi tekeke nkarhi wutsongo ku tlula lowu valavisisi a va wu ehleketa eku sunguleni?","The correct answer is **D: Hundzuluko wa swivumbiwa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the formation of a new finch species occurred in just two generations, much faster than scientists previously believed species formation takes. The other options are not directly related to the speed of the evolutionary process itself.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga vikiwangiki hi valavisisi?,"The passage mentions:

*   **A: Laha xivumbiwa lexintshwa xi tumbulukeke kona (Where the new species originated):** The passage states the new species formed on the Ecuadorean Galápagos Islands.
*   **B: Ku leha ka endlelo ra hundzuluko (The length of the evolutionary process):** The passage specifically mentions that the new species formed in only two generations, contradicting the belief that speciation takes a long time.
*   **D: Swinyenyana leswi katsekaka eku tswaleni (The birds involved in the breeding):** The passage names the two Darwin's finch species involved (Geospiza fortis and Geospiza conirostris).

The passage **does not** mention the name of the new species.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: Vito ra swivumbiwa leswintshwa (The name of the new species)**"
Xana CowParade yi ta endliwa kwihi?,"The correct answer is **B: Eka Doroba ra Bucharest**.

The passage states that Bucharest will be the first city in southeastern Europe to host CowParade. This implies that the event will take place in Bucharest.
"
Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi hlamuselaka kahle CowParade?,"The correct answer is **D: I xiendlakalo lexikulu swinene xo navetisa swilo swa vutshila emisaveni**.

The passage states: ""Doroba leri ri ta va ro sungula edzongavupeladyambu bya Yuropa ku rhurhela CowParade, ku nga xiendlakalo xa vutshila lexikulu swinene emisaveni..."" This directly supports option D.
"
I yini lexi vangeleke Russia ku yimisa ku tirhisiwa ka ti-II-76?,"The correct answer is **B: Khombo**.

The passage states: ""Russia hi nkarhinyana yi tshike ku hahisa Il-76 endzhaku ka khombo rero."" (""Russia temporarily grounded Il-76s after that accident."")
"
I yini II-76?,"The correct answer is **C: Xihahampfhuka**

The passage states that ""Il-76 a yi ri xiphemunkulu xa masocha ya Russia na Soviet..."" which translates to ""Il-76 was a staple of Russian and Soviet military..."" and also ""Russia hi nkarhinyana yi tshike ku hahisa Il-76 endzhaku ka khombo rero,"" which translates to ""Russia temporarily stopped flying Il-76 after that accident."" This implies the Il-76 is something that flies, therefore it is a plane (xihahampfhuka).
"
I mani loyi a hirheke xipanu xo tsala xa The Simpsons?,"The correct answer is **B: Simon**.

The passage states: ""Hi 1989 u pfunile leswaku ku endliwa The Simpsons with Brooks and Groening, naswona a ri ni vutihlamuleri byo thora ntlawa wo sungula wa vatsari va nongonoko."" This clearly indicates that Simon was responsible for hiring the initial writing team.
"
"Hikuya hi Fluke, i mani loyi a a n’wi rhumelela swibumabumelo leswinene ni xikhuthazo ?","The correct answer is **D: Vanhu va xinuna ni va xisati**.

The passage states: ""U fikelele xiboho lexi hikwalaho ka swibumabumelo leswinene ni xikhutaza xa vaxisati ni vaxinuna..."" which translates to ""...she reached this conclusion because of the positive recommendations and encouragement of women and men..."" Therefore, the correct answer is people of both genders.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini leswi vanhu van’wana a va nga lavi leswaku vavasati va vulavula ha swona?","The correct answer is **C: Rihanyo ra vavasati (Women's health)**.

The passage states that ""Fluke u tsale leswaku matshalatshala ya van’wana yo pfala vavasati milomu leswaku va nga vulavule hi ta rihanyo ra vavasati a ma humelelanga."" which translates to ""Fluke wrote that other people's efforts to shut women's mouths so that they don't speak about women's health were unsuccessful."" This directly indicates that some people didn't want women to speak about their health issues.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi wihi miri wa pulanete lowu rharhanganeke?","The correct answer is **A: Misava**.

The passage states that ""ku na miri wun’we ntsena wa tipulanete lowu kombisaka ku cinca loku hundzaka Titan, naswona vito ra yona i Misava"". This directly translates to ""there is only one planetary body that shows change exceeding Titan, and its name is Earth"".
"
Milambu ni mikova leyi nga ni xihalaki lexi voningelaka yi kumiwile eka miri wihi wa pulanete?,"The answer is **B: Titan**.

The passage explicitly mentions Titan as a planetary body that exhibits change similar to Earth. Therefore, if rivers and lakes with a reflective surface are found on a planetary body, based on the provided passage, Titan is the most likely answer.
"
Eka leswi kumiweke hi xihi lexi nga vangiwangiki hi hundzuluko wa tinsiva?,"The correct answer is **A: Muvala wa voya bya xiharhi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically mentions the study providing details about the colors of the dinosaur's feathers (brownish-red on top and pale or yellow underneath).
*   The passage also discusses how the feather structure suggests they weren't used for flight but possibly for thermoregulation or display (option B).
*   The passage explicitly states that the findings offer insight into the evolution of bird feathers (option C).
*   The passage begins by stating that the study confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers (option D)."
Xana tinsiva ta dinasora a ti pfumala yini?,"The correct answer is **B: Tirachisi**.

The passage states: ""Hikwalaho ka leswi tinsiva ta tidinasora ti nga dzikangiki hi ku kula, leswi vuriwaka rachisi..."" which means dinosaur feathers lacked rachis.
"
Eka swivula leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki ntiyiso malunghana na ZMapp?,"Mpfuno wo karhi:
* Xiyenge xa yindlu P xi vula leswaku dyondzo ya ximfumo yi komba leswaku ZMapp a yi vuyerisi swinene eku siveleni rifu.
* Xiyenge xa yindlu P xi vula leswaku ZMapp yi tirhisiwa tanihi xilawuri eka ndzingeto wa PALM.
* Xiyenge xa yindlu P xi vula leswaku ZMapp yi tshembisa eku sunguleni.

Xihlamulo lexinene hi lexi: B"
Eka swivula leswaku landzelaka hi xihi lexi hlamuselaka kahle ndzingeto wa PALM?,"The correct answer is **C: ZMapp a yi tirhisiwa tanihi xisekelo xa ndzingeto**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Eka ndzingeto wa PALM, ZMapp wu tiaka leswaku van’wasayense va wu tirhise tanihi masungula ivi va wu ringanisa ni vutshunguri lebyin’wana byinharhu."" This directly translates to ""In the PALM trial, ZMapp scientists used it as a foundation and compared it to three other treatments.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tidyondzo ti komba leswaku yi nga ha va ni vuyelo byo tala ku tlula leswi a swi languteriwile eku sunguleni** - The passage doesn't state the outcome of the PALM trial, so we can't conclude whether it had more benefits than initially expected.

*   **B: Xidzidzirisi xo lawula a xi pimanisiwa ni vutshunguri byin’wana, byin’wana bya kona i ZMapp** - ZMapp was not used as the control drug

*   **D: Yi tikombe yi tirha ku tshungula mavabyi lama nga kona** - The passage does not state the result of the trial or which treatments, if any, were successful."
Hi kwihi laha valavisisi va ehleketaka leswaku chipi leyintshwa yi ta va ya nkoka swona kona?,"The correct answer is **A: Matiko ya miholo ya le hansi**.

The passage explicitly states that the researchers believe the chip will be most helpful in low-income countries because of the lower survival rates for diseases like breast cancer compared to wealthy countries.
"
I endlelo rihi leri nga ta tirhisiwa ku endla xitirhisiwa xa vulavisisi?,"The correct answer is **B: Tipurintara ta ntolovelo ta inkjet**.

The passage states: ""...chipi yitsanana leyi kotaka ku purinteke lexi nga endliwaka hi ku tirhisa tipurintara ta inkjet leyi nga koxaka kwalomu ka sente yin’we ya U.S.""  This directly indicates inkjet printers are used to create the research device.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xivulwa lexi nga riki ntiyiso malunghana na lobate scarps?","The correct answer is **D: A hi swo tala leswi kumiweke evuandlalweni bya n’weti**.

Here's why:

*   **P says:** ""...Ti scarps ti kumiwe eka n’weti hinkwaho..."" This directly contradicts option D, which states that they are not commonly found throughout the moon.
*   **The other options are accurate based on paragraph P:**
    *   **A:** The paragraph mentions that the fractures appear relatively young, suggesting they formed recently.
    *   **B:** The discovery of lobate scarps challenges the idea that the moon is geologically inactive.
    *   **C:** The paragraph explicitly states that lobate scarps are believed to be caused by the moon shrinking."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi wahi mavonelo malunghana ni xiyimo xa misava lexi kombisaka leswaku ku ni ku cincacinca ka swilo en’wetini?","The correct answer is **D: Xiyimo xa misava lexi nga kona a hi khale xi humelerile (The existing landforms are relatively recent)**

Here's why:

* The passage states that the ""scarps"" appear relatively fresh, indicating that the changes causing them (the moon shrinking) haven't happened too long ago. This supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: N’weti lowu vuyelelanaka hakatsongotsongo (The moon that is shrinking slightly)** While the shrinking moon *causes* the landforms, the *existence* of recent landforms is the *evidence* for change. The question asks about the landforms themselves.
* **B: Xiyimo xa misava i khale xi vumbekile (The landforms are old)** This is the opposite of what the passage argues. The scarps are presented as *recent*.
* **C: Ku ni xiyimo xa misava lexitsongo evuandlalweni bya n’weti (There are small landforms on the surface of the moon)** While true, this isn't the *specific* evidence indicating *recent* change. Many landforms on the moon are old. The *freshness* of these scarps is the key.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi swihi leswi nga taka swi nga tali ku kondza ku andlariwa swihehlo?","The correct answer is **C: Mabulo ya vumbhoni bya lava swi voneke hi mahlo**.

The passage states that the Crown Office informed the news media that ""no comment would be made pending sentencing"". This implies that discussions about the eyewitness testimony would be withheld until after the sentencing. The passage specifically mentions the problematic nature of publishing images, but the Crown Office statement points to a more general suppression of comment.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi lexi nga riki xiphiqo eka lava lemaka?","The correct answer is **D: Ayisi leyi n'okaka (Melting ice)**.

Here's why:

The passage mentions:

*   **Swiyimo swo biha swa maxelo (Bad weather conditions)** - this is a problem.
*   **Mpimo wa ayisi (The scale of the ice)** - this is a problem.
*   **Ku andza ka ayisi leyi tlhandlekelaneke (The extent of accumulated ice)** - this is a problem.

The passage does *not* say anything about ice melting. In fact, the problem is the opposite - *too much* ice.
"
"Ku engetela eka ayisi, i yini xin’wana lexi kavanyetaka matshalatshala yo nyika mpfuno wo ponisa?","The correct answer is **B: Xiyimo xa maxelo**

The passage clearly states that ""swiyimo swo biha swa maxelo swi kavanyete matshalatshala yo nyika mpfuno wo ponisa"" which translates to ""bad weather conditions disrupted rescue efforts."" So weather is the other factor disrupting rescue efforts besides the ice.
"
Hi kwihi ku pfumela loku Roberts a aleke ku ku tiyisisa?,"The correct answer is **C: Masungulo ya vutomi**.

The passage states that Roberts refused to explicitly state his beliefs on ""whether life has a beginning"". Therefore, the correct answer is C.
"
Hi yihi mhaka leyi Roberts a ehleketa leswaku a yi nga faneleki ku bula hayona?,"The correct answer is **D: Vuxokoxoko bya milandzu**.

The passage states that Roberts felt it wasn't appropriate to talk specifically about things that *might* happen (this implies future cases or legal details). The other options are things he *did* comment on.
"
Tiphuphu timbirhi ta rivoni ti voninga kwihi?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is:

*   **A: Ku kongoma exibakabakeni** (Directly at the sky)

The passage states that the light pillars are ""yimisiwile ti languta etilweni nivusiku"" which means ""standing still facing the sky at night."""
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana miako leyintshwa ya swithezi yi akiwa rini endhawini ya kona?","The correct answer is **D: Ku aka ku ya emahlweni** (Construction is ongoing).

The text mentions that ""Ku karhi ku akiwa miako yo leha swinene leyintshwa ya ntlhanu"" which translates to ""Five very tall new buildings are being built"".  The verb ""ku karhi ku akiwa"" implies that the construction is in progress. The text does not specify when the construction is happening, only that it is happening.
"
Hi rihi rungula leri ringanyetaka leswaku The Seven Sisters ku vuriwa mabako?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku cincacinca ka maxelo (Ku cincacinca ka maxelo)**

The passage states: ""Swifaniso swa infrared swi kombisa leswaku ku cincacinca ka maxelo ku suka nivusiku ku ya ninhlikanhi ku kombisa leswaku swi nga endleka ku ri mabako. Ma horile ku tlula tindhawu leti ma rhendzeleke ninhlikanhi naswona ma hisa nivusiku."" This directly links temperature variations to the possibility of them being caves.
"
Xana xiyimo xa mahiselo ya Seven Sisters xi langutisisiwa ku yini?,"The correct answer is **A: Swifaniso swa infrared** (Infrared images).

The passage states: ""Swifaniso swa infrared swi kombisa leswaku ku cincacinca ka maxelo ku suka nivusiku ku ya ninhlikanhi ku kombisa leswaku swi nga endleka ku ri mabako."" (Infrared images show that the temperature changes from night to day indicate that they may be caves).
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xivulwa lexi nga riki ntiyiso hi muehleketeleriwa?","Mhlamulo lowu nga riki ntiyiso hi **A: U tirhise movha enkarhini wa nhlaselo**.

Hi rihi rungula ra nhlaselo leri valawuri va ri tiyisiseke?,"The correct answer is **B: Rixaka ra muehleketeleriwa**.

The paragraph states that authorities know the suspect is part of the Uighur group, which is his ethnicity. The paragraph also clearly indicates that the suspect's name is unknown (D) and there is no mention of the authorities confirming any motives for the attack (C) or information about the attackers associates (A).
"
Hi swihi swipanu leswi nga ta tlanga eka ntlangu wa le Ellis Park?,"The correct answer is **C: Afrika Dzonga na Australia**.

The passage states: ""Ntlango wa fayinali wa tiseries wu ta tlangeriwa eEllis Park eJoni vhiki leri taka, loko ti Springboks ti tlanga na Australia."" This translates to ""The final game of the series will be played at Ellis Park in Joburg next week, when the Springboks play Australia.""
"
Xana ti-Springboks ti ta tlanga kwihi ntlangu wa tona lowu landzelaka?,"The correct answer is **C: Johannesburg**.

The text states that the final game of the series will be played at Ellis Park in Joni (Johannesburg) where the Springboks will play Australia.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi xitichi xa swifambo swo ya empfhukeni xi veke ni xiphiqo haxona eka pfhumba leri?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku hlayisa gyroscope**.

The passage states that the space station lost its gyroscope during the space flight. The rest of the options are related to either solutions to the problem or outcomes after the gyroscope malfunctioned.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, a ku ri yihi pakani ya pfhumba ra xitichi xa swifambo swo ya empfhukeni?","The correct answer is **C: Ku hetisisa ku famba empfhukeni**.

The passage states that even though the space station lost a gyroscope, they continued the mission until its completion (""ku fikela mfambo wa le xibakabakeni wu herile""). The other options are related to problems encountered or solutions used during the mission, but not the overall goal.
"
Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki ntiyiso malunghana ni nandzu?,"Nhlamulo leyi hoxeke i: **D: AOL yi hehliwile.**

Xivulwa xi vula leswaku munhu u gweviwe hikwalaho ka leswi AOL yi nga kaya ra murhangeri wa yona, kasi AOL a yi hehliwanga, kambe nandzu wu avanyisiwe hi nawu lowu tirhisiweke ku hunguta ti imeyili to tele, lowu tiviwaka tanihi spam.
"
Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi hlamuselaka kahle nandzu lowu?,"The correct answer is **D: AOL yi sungule ku avanyisiwa ka nandzu lowu.**

Here's why:

*   **The original statement (P)** says the case happened in Virginia because AOL, ""the leading Internet service provider,"" was based there, ""company that committed the crime."" This clearly implies AOL was involved in something that led to the case.

Let's examine why the other options are not as accurate:

*   **A: AOL yi hehliwile hi ku hangalasiwa loku nga hleriwangiki** While the case deals with spam, the statement doesn't explicitly say AOL was *accused* of spamming. It implies involvement, but not necessarily direct spamming. The person was convicted based on this law against spamming.
*   **B: Nandzu lowu a wu katsa vakorhokeri vambirhi lava fambaka emahlweni va inthanete** The statement only mentions AOL as a leading Internet service provider. We don't know if there was another one involved.
*   **C: Nandzu lowu wu avanyisiwile hi 2003** The statement notes that the LAW used to convict the person was created in 2003, not that the case itself happened or was resolved in 2003."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xipanu lexi Vidal a sunguleke ku tlanga eka xona eka tinguva tinharhu leti hundzeke?","The correct answer is **A: Sevilla**.

The passage states that Vidal joined Barça from Sevilla. Therefore, Sevilla is where he played before joining Barça.
"
Xana Vidal u tlange mitlangu yingani eka Barça?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**

The passage states ""Ku sukela loko a rhurhele edorobenikulu ra Catalan, Vidal a a tlange mitlangu ya 49 eka xipano xexo."" which means ""Since moving to the Catalan capital, Vidal has played 49 games for the team.""
"
Hi xihi xipanu lexi a va tlanga na xona eka ntlangu wa kona?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**.

The passage states: ""A a tshama ehotela ya ntlawa emahlweni ka ntlangu lowu a wu kunguhateriwe Sonto va lwisana na Bolonia."" This directly translates to ""He was staying in the team hotel before the game that was scheduled for Sunday against Bolonia.""
"
Hikwalaho ka yini Jarque a a tshame ehoteleni?,"The best answer is **C: A a ri ni ntlangu hi Sonto**.

The passage states that he was staying at the team hotel ""ahead of Sunday's game against Bologna"". While A and B could be related, C is the most direct reason given in the text for him being at the hotel. D is incorrect because they were playing against Bologna.
"
Hikwalaho ka yini geophysics ya Jakarta yi nga humesanga xilemukiso?,"The correct answer is **D: A yi nga fikeleli mpimo lowu lavekaka wa ku tsekatseka ka misava**.

The passage explicitly states that ""ku hava xilemukiso xa tsunami lexi nga ta nyikeriwa hikuva ku tsekatseka ka kona a ku fikanga eka mpimo wa 6.5 lowu lavekaka"" which directly supports option D.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana ku tsekatseka ka misava ku vangele yini?","The correct answer is **A: Ku chava eka vaakatiko**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that despite no tsunami warning being issued, ""vaaki va sungule ku chava ivi va sungula ku siya mabindzu ni makaya ya vona"" (residents began to fear and started to leave their businesses and homes). This indicates that the earthquake caused fear among the residents.
*   The other options are incorrect according to the passage:

    *   B: Nxungeto wa tsunami (Tsunami threat): The passage explicitly says there was NO tsunami threat.
    *   C: Ku humesiwa ka xilemukiso (Issuance of a warning): The passage says NO tsunami warning was issued.
    *   D: Mpimo wa ntikelo wa 6.5 (Magnitude of 6.5): The passage states that the earthquake didn't reach the magnitude of 6.5 required for a tsunami warning."

"
Xana nhlayo ya nyeleti ya Rossby yi kumiwa njhani?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku vangama ni ku rhendzeleka**.

The passage states: ""Ku vangama ni ku rhendzeleka swi tirhisa swin’we ku kumisisa nhlayo ya Rossby ya nyeleti..."" which directly answers the question of how a star's Rossby number is determined.
"
I tiphesente tingani ta vanhu lava vutisiweke swivutiso lava seketelaka leswaku Australia yi va rhephabuliki xikan’wekan’we?,"The correct answer is **B: 29 wa tiphesente**.

The passage states: ""Eka tlhelo lerin’wana, 29 wa tiphesente ta lava vutisiweke va tshembha leswaku Australia yi fanele yi va rhephabuliki hi ku hatlisa..."" This directly answers the question of what percentage of people support Australia becoming a republic immediately.
"
"Hikuya hi Julie Gillad, xana Australia yi fanele ku va rhephabuliki rini?","The correct answer is **B: Endzhaku ka ku fuma ka Hosi ya Xisati wa Vumbirhi Elizabeth**.

The text states: ""Holobye Nkulu Julia Gillard u vule leswaku eka nhlawulo wa 2010 a a tshembha leswaku Australia yi fanele yi va rhephabuliki eku heteleleni ka ku fuma ka Hosi Ya Xisati Wa Vumbirhi Elizabeth."" This directly supports option B.
"
Hi wihi nhlangano lowu lavisisiwaka hi va nawu,"The correct answer is **C: Planned Parenthood**.

The passage states that the Komen Foundation's policy affected Planned Parenthood due to an investigation into Planned Parenthood's financial practices led by Representative Cliff Stearns.
"
Cliff Stearns i murhangeri wa komiti yihi?,"The correct answer is **D: Komiti Leyitsongo Ya Vukambisisi Na Vulavisisi**.

Hi rini laha Del Potro a bohekeke ku ongola kahle leri a ri n’wi karhata?,"The correct answer is **C: Eka sete ya vumbirhi**.

The text states: ""Hi nkarhi wolowo, Potro u kume vuongori bya katla ra yena kambe u swi kotile ku tlhelela eka ntlangu."" and ""Del Potro u nghene eka ntlangu wa vumbirhi a ri ka xiyimo xo antswa, kambe na leswi swi lave leswaku ku va na wun’wana loyi a hlulaka endzhaku ka ku tlanga hi ku ringana ka 6-6."". This indicates the medical attention happened during the second set after a 6-6 tie.
"
Vuyelo bya tie-break yo sungula byi ve byihi?,"The correct answer is **D: Del Porto u hlurile eka sete ya vumbirhi**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Del Potro entered the second game in a better position, and it went to a 6-6 tie.
*   It mentions that Del Potro received treatment for his knee but returned to the game.
*   Since the first sentence confirms that ""Murray u hluriwile eka ntlangu wo sungula endzhaku ka loko vavanuna lava vambirhi va tlange ku ringana"", we can assume that it went to a tie-break
*   It implies that Del Potro won the second set after the tie-break."
"Hilaha swi boxiweke hakona eka xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi ngopfungopfu a a ri ekusuhi ni muvabyi?","The correct answer is **B: Vana**.

The passage states, ""Namuntlha, hi kume leswaku **vana van’wana lava ringaniweke hi kuya exikolweni** ku kumiwe leswaku va tihlanganise na muvabyi."" This clearly indicates that children were in close proximity to the patient.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi swihi leswi mulawuri a nga swi tiyisisangiki loko a vulavula ni vaaki va Texas?","The correct answer is **B: Swilo swa endliwa ku sirhelela vuhlayiseki bya rixaka.**

Here's why:

*   **P:** Perry assured people that steps were being taken to protect *everyone*. This implies measures to protect public safety.

The other options are directly supported by the text:

*   **A: Fambiselo ri tirha kahle:** Perry explicitly said ""Tiyiseka leswaku fambiselo ra hina ri le ku tirheni hilaha ri faneleke ri tirha ha yona.” (Ensure our system is working as it should).
*   **C: Va lulamerile ku langutana ni ntlhontlho:** Perry explicitly said ""Ku ni tindhawu ti nga ri tingani emisaveni leti lunghekeleke ku langutana na nandzu lowu."" (Few places in the world are ready to deal with this issue).
*   **D: Mhaka leyi a yi na ntikelo:** Perry explicitly said ""Nandzu lowu i wa nkoka."" (This issue is important).

Therefore, the best answer is B."
Hi wihi nongonoko wa mahungu lowu simekiweke hi khale ka swichudeni swa UW?,"The correct answer is **D: The Onion**.

The passage states that Heck and Johnson conceived of the satirical publication that would skewer news while they were students at UW in 1988. This publication is then identified as The Onion.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga katsiwangiki eka nongonoko wa mahungu wa The Onion?","The correct answer is **B: Filimi**.

The passage mentions a printed publication, website, 24-hour news ticker, podcasts, and a world atlas as part of The Onion's offerings. A film is not mentioned.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi a xi rindziwe hi maphorisa?","The correct answer is **C: Vungheno bya Downing Street**.

Hi swihi leswi nga ntiyiso hi ndzavisiso lowu endliweke hi Dok. Ehud Ur?,"The correct answer is **B: Makondlo man’wana lawa a ma ri ni vuvabyi bya chukela sweswi a ma ha ri na byona vuvabyi bya chukela**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Sweswi hi ni makondlo ya tin’hweti ta 4 lawa ma nga riki na vuvabyi bya chukela kambe eku sunguleni a ma ri ni vuvabyi bya chukela"" which translates to: ""We now have 4-month-old mice that do not have diabetes but initially had diabetes.""
*   The passage says that these findings ""a swi va khumbi vanhu lava va nga ni vuvabyi bya chukela bya Type 1"", which means it doesn't involve humans with Type 1 diabetes.
*   The passage states that the research is in its early stages and he is not sure that a cure for diabetes is possible.
*   The passage does not mention that mice who previously didn't have diabetes now have it."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini leswi vilerisaka Dok. Ur?","The correct answer is **A: Loko leswi kumiweke swi tirha eka vanhu lava nga ni vuvabyi bya chukela bya Type 1.**

The passage states that Dr. Ur, along with other experts, is unsure if diabetes is curable. More specifically, he says that the findings do *not* affect people with Type 1 diabetes. This implies his concern is whether these findings will be applicable to Type 1 diabetes.
"
Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga hlamuseliki hi ku kongoma ku wa ka Xihahampfhuka xa CG4684?,"The correct answer is **C: Xihahampfhuka xi ringete ku phatsama kanharhu xi nga si wa**

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** The plane attempted to land at Kokoda once but was aborted. It disappeared about ten minutes *before* its second landing attempt. This means it attempted to land twice, not three times.

The other options are directly supported by the text:

*   **A:** The plane was initially unable to land due to weather (""Ti Twin Otter a ti ringeta ku yima eKokoda tolo tanihi swihaha mpfhuka PNG xihaha mpfhuka CG4684, kambe ku yimisiwe xin’we."")
*   **B:** The crash site was in a remote area (""Laha xi weleke kona ku kumekile namuntlha naswona a ku fikeleleki hi ku olova lerova maphorisa mambirhi va siyiwe ekhwatini leswaku va ya laha nghozi yi endlekeke kona no lava lava va poneke."")
*   **D:** The search was hampered by weather (""Vulavisisi byi kavanyetiwe hi maxelo lama fanaka lama vangeke ku yimisiwa ko yimisa."")"
I yini lexi vangeleke Xihahampfhuka xa CG4684 ku tshika xi nga ha phatsami?,"The correct answer is **D: Xiyimo xa maxelo a xi nga ri xinene (The weather conditions were not good)**

The passage explicitly states that the plane's first landing attempt was aborted because of the weather: ""...Ti Twin Otter a ti ringeta ku yima eKokoda tolo tanihi swihaha mpfhuka PNG xihaha mpfhuka CG4684, kambe ku yimisiwe xin’we."" and ""Vulavisisi byi kavanyetiwe hi maxelo lama fanaka lama vangeke ku yimisiwa ko yimisa.""
"
"Hi ku landza xiyenge lexi, eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga ntiyiso hi Franciszek Kowal?","The correct answer is **B: Eku heteleleni a nga vavisekanga**.

Here's why:

*   **P: Leswi tsakisaka hikuva a ku endlekanga nchumu ka mina** - This translates to ""Luckily nothing happened to me,"" indicating he was not injured.
*   The rest of the passage focuses on his observations of others trying to escape and doesn't imply he was injured in any way."
Hikwalaho ka yini swi tika ku vona ndlela leyi Xidzedze xa Thiropikali Danielle xi nga onhaka hayona?,"The correct answer is **C: Xidzedze xi le kule ni ku fika laha ku tshamaka vanhu**.

The passage states: ""Tanihi leswi xidzedze xi nga kule na ndhawu leyi nga misava, swa tika ku vona ndlela leyi xi nga onhaka United States kumbe Caribbean."" This directly translates to ""As the storm is not close to land, it is difficult to see how it could harm the United States or the Caribbean.""
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki ntiyiso hi ta Xidzedze xa Thiropikali Danielle?","Jawabu leyi nga riki ntiyiso hi leyi:

"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, ku ringanyetiwa leswaku ku fanele ku endleka yini hi vuvabyi byi nga si hundzuka ntungu wa misava hinkwayo?","The correct answer is **A: Byi fanele ku hunguta ku dlaya ka byona**.

The passage states: ""Tidyondzo tin’wana ti ringanyeta leswaku vuvabyi lebyi byi fanele byi hunguta ku dlaya ka byona byi nga si va ntungu wa misava hinkwayo...""
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana bubutsa a ri ri ekule ku fikela kwihi na Fujian?","The correct answer is **C: 70 wa tikhilomitara**

The passage states: ""Malunghana ni vusiku bya August 9, tihlo ra Morakot a ri ri kwalomu ka tikhilomitara ta khume nkombo ekule na xifundza nkulu xa Fujian xa le Chayina.""  ""Khume nkombo"" translates to seventy.
"
I mani loyi a xewete George W. Bush loko a fika le Asia?,"The correct answer is **D: Xandla xa Holobyenkulu**.

The passage states: ""U xewetiwe hi Xandla xa Holobyenkulu le Singapore ku nga Wong Kan Seng..."" which translates to ""He was greeted by the Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore, Wong Kan Seng..."". While Lee Hsien Loong (Holobyenkulu) was also involved in discussions later, the question asks who greeted him *upon arrival*.
"
Hi rini laha muungameri a vulavuleke kona hi ku ndlandlamuxiwa ka nxaviselano le Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Endzhaku ku lahlekeriwa kakwe eka nhlawulo wa le xikarhi**.

The passage states: ""Endzhaku ka vhiki ra ku lahlekeriwa eka nhlawulo wa le xikarhi, Bush u byele vayingiseri hi ta ku ndlandlamuxiwa ka nxaviselano na Asia."" (After a week of loss in the midterm election, Bush told the audience about expanding trade with Asia.)
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka kwihi ku tiyimisela lokukulu ka hulumendhe?","The correct answer is **A: Ku xava makalichi lama engetelekeke hi March lembe leri**.

The passage states that today's announcement *expands* on a commitment made in March of this year. This means the March commitment was the original, larger commitment upon which today's announcement builds.
"
Xana hulumendhe yi tivise yini?,"The correct answer is **A: Va hlela ku xava makalichi lama engetelekeke ya 300**.

The text explicitly states that the government ""xi tlhele xi ndlandlamuxa ku tiyimisela ka hulumendhe loku endliweke hi March lembe leri ka leswaku ku xaviwa makalichi lama engetelekeke."" and that ""Makalichi lama engetelekeke ya 300 ma engetele nhlayo ya makalichi ma va 1,300"". This indicates their plan to purchase an additional 300 carriages. The question asks what the government announced, and the purchase of 300 additional carriages is the most direct answer.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi rihi rungula leri tiviwaka?","The correct answer is **A: Mpimo wa nxungeto wu hungutekile**.

Here's why:

* **P:** The passage states ""ku hungutiwa ka nxungeto wu yisiwa eka xiyimo xo nyanya"" which directly translates to ""the reduction of the threat taken to a high degree/level"". This means the threat level *has* been reduced.
* **B:** The passage states ""a swi vuli leswaku nxungeto hinkwawo wu fambile"" which translates to ""it does not mean that all threats are gone."" Therefore we cannot assume the threat is gone.
* **C:** The passage indicates intelligence suggesting an *imminent* attack, but the reduction in threat level implies this isn't the *current* expectation.
* **D:** The intelligence suggests a potential attack may happen, however it doesn't specify if the threat will increase.

Therefore only **A** can be proven from the passage."
Hi xihi xivulwa lexi nga riki ntiyiso malunghana ni u kombisa ku vilela?,"Nhlamulo leyi nga riki ya ntiyiso exikarhi ka tindlela leti yi **C: Switereko swi koxe leswaku CEP a tshika ntirho**.

"
I mani loyi a ringanyeteke leswaku CEP la hundzeke a tshika ntirho?,"The correct answer is **C: Khomixini ya muungameri**.

The passage states: ""N’wheti leyi nga hela khomixini ya muungameri yi ringanyete ku tsala papila ro tshika ntirho eka CEP ku sungula..."" (The outgoing presidential commission suggested writing a letter of resignation to the CEP to begin...).

"Hikuya hi xitatimendhe, hi swihi leswi seketeriwiki hi USA Gymnastics endzhaku ka loko Nassar a khome vatlangi ku biha?","The correct answer is **C and D**.

Here's why:

*   **C: Ku cinca loku lavekaka eka nhlangano (Necessary changes within the organization)**: The statement explicitly says, ""USA Gymnastics...accepts any and all necessary and appropriate changes.""
*   **D: Vulavisisi lebyi tiyimeleke (Independent investigation)**: The statement says, ""USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation...""

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **C and D**."
"Hikuya hi xitatimendhe, hi yihi pakanikulu ya USA Gymnastics na United States Olympic Committee ku ya emahlweni?","The correct answer is **D: Ku simeka mbango lowu sirhelelekeke wa vatlangi** (To establish a safe environment for athletes).

The passage explicitly states: ""USA Gymnastics na USOC ti na pakani leyi fanaka — ku endla ntlangu wa ti-gymnastic, ni yin’wana, yi hlayiseka hilaha swi nga kotekaka hakona eka vatlangi leswaku va landzela milorho ya vona eka mbango lowu hlayisekeke, lowunene ni lowu va nyikaka matimba."" This directly translates to their shared goal of making gymnastics (and other sports) as safe as possible for athletes.
"
Xana xikepe a xi ya kwihi loko mhangu yi humelela? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palawan**.

The passage states: ""Muxaka wa xikepe xa nhlaselo xa Avenger, a xi ri endleleni yo kongoma le Puerto Princesa e Palawan."" This clearly indicates that the ship was headed to Palawan.
"
Hi swihi leswi nga riki ntiyiso malunghana ni xikepe leswi boxiweke eka xiyenge lexi?,"Nhlamulo leyi nga riki ntiyiso hi **B: Ntsindza wa xona wu le Palawan**.

"
I mani loyi a rhumeleke xitatimendhe malunghana ni mavuthu ya US?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**.

The passage states that ""Muungameri wa United States Donald Trump, eka mbulavulo lowu a wu rhuleke hi ku tirhisa matsalana wa ta mahungu, u tivisa leswaku masocha ya US a ma ta suka le Syria."" This clearly indicates that Donald Trump was the one who made the announcement.
"
"Hikuya hi xitatimendhe, hi rihi tiko leri byarheke vutihlamuleri byo rindza vabohiwa lava lwaka?","The correct answer is **D: Turkey**.

The passage states: ""Turkey a ri ta tlhela ri rindza vabohiwa lava lwelaka ISIS...""
"
Xana ku ehleketiwa leswaku i yini lexi wiseke xihahampfhuka?,"The correct answer is **B: Ndzilo lowukulu**.

The passage states: ""Mhangu leyi yi endleke etintshaveni naswona **ku ehleketiwa leswaku yi vangiwe hi ndzilo lowukulu**."" (The crash happened in the mountains and **it is believed to have been caused by a large fire**).

While the other options (difficult terrain and bad weather) hinder the search efforts, the *suspected cause* of the crash is the large fire.
"
Xana xihahampfhuka xi we eka ndhawu ya njhani?,"The correct answer is **D: Ndhawu ya tintshava**

The text states: ""Mhangu leyi yi endleke etintshaveni... "" which translates to ""The accident happened in the mountains...""
"
Xana vatirhelamfumo va langutele yini hikwalaho ka ndhambi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku tlheriseriwa ka sava**.

The passage states: ""Hambi mpimo wa mati wu nga ta tlakuka ntsena endzhaku ka ndhambi, vatirhelamfumo va tshemba leswaku ma ta va ma ringene ku tlherisela risava ri khuluka ni nambu."" This clearly indicates that officials hope the flood will be sufficient to return sediment flow to the river.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi khumbiweke hi ku akiwa ka damu?,"The correct answer is **B: Nkavavangaheti lowukulu**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly mentions the nkavavangaheti lowukulu (large shark-like fish) being one of the species endangered due to the dam's construction.
* While the passage mentions the need for silt and gravel (A) for habitat (C), and officials' hopes of water levels being sufficient to restore silt flow and the river, the direct and negative impact is specifically mentioned for the nkavavangaheti lowukulu. Option D is not mentioned in the provided text.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the passage is **B**.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi a nyikeke rungula eka United States hi ta mihlaselo leyi a yi ehleketeleriwa?","The correct answer is **C: Xihlovo lexi nga paluxiwangiki**

The passage states that the U.S. received information from ""xihlovo lexi nga paluxiwangiki"" which translates to ""an undisclosed source"".
"
Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi hlamuselaka kahle rhengu ro hlasela leri ehleketiwaka ra vapfukeri?,"The most accurate answer is **C: Ku fuhleka tibomo etindhawini ta nkoka ematikweni mambirhi** (Planting bombs in key locations in both countries).

Here's why:

*   The passage states the suicide bombers will target ""popular locations"" in **Ethiopia and Kenya**. ""Popular locations"" is best interpreted as ""key locations"".
*   The passage explicitly mentions **both Kenya and Ethiopia** as targets."
Eka vanhu lava landzelaka hi wihi loyi a nga riki mutivi wa nawu?,"The correct answer is **D: Makis Triantafylopoulos**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Sakis Kechagioglou and George Nikolakopoulos are lawyers (""vativi va nawu"").
*   The passage also states that Petros Mantouvalos is a member of Parliament ""na qgweta"" (and a lawyer).
*   Makis Triantafylopoulos is identified as a writer (""mutsari"") who hosts a TV show. Therefore, he is not a lawyer."
Hi wihi ntlawa wa vanhu lowu nga boxiwiki tanihi xiphemu xa vudyeleri eka ntlawa wa vativi va nawu va Magiriki?,"The correct answer is **C: Vatsari va mahungu**.

The passage mentions Vaavanyisi, vativi va nawu, vadyeleri, and vagqweta as being involved in illegal activities. Vatsari va mahungu (journalists) are not mentioned as being part of the corruption ring.
"
Xana India yi lahlekeriwe hi tiwiketi tingani?,"The correct answer is **A: 11**.

The passage states: ""ivi ku humesiwa tiwiketi ta 7 ku heta ntlangu"" which, added to the other 4 previously dismissed batsmen (Robin Uthappa, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, and the captain), equals 11 wickets in total.
"

Here's why:

The passage states that Adam Cuerden's frustration stems from:

*   Wales ""lying to [them] from the start.""
*   Wales pretending ""that this was about legal reasons.""
*   Wales pretending to listen, ""only to sideline.""

Therefore options B, C, and D are reasons for his frustration. Option A is not.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi susiweke exivandleni xexo?","The passage states that ""Ku pfilunganyeka ka rixaka ku vangela matshalatshala ya sweswi yo andlala pholisi malunghana ni lava tameleke ta masangu eka xivandla lexi"". This means the problem is related to ""lava tameleke ta masangu"" (those who hold sexual content). Therefore, the answer is **B: Leswi tameriweke timhaka ta masangu.**
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi Amir Khan a nga xi seketeliki?","The correct answer is **A: Ku katsa vavasati lava lwaka eka Tiolimpiki**.

The passage states that Amir Khan said he doesn't think women should fight. This directly contradicts the inclusion of women fighters in the Olympics. The passage also mentions that he supports British competitors and that the Olympics are held in London. The passage does not mention his views on women’s opinion.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi Amir Khan a nga ta xi seketela swi nga ri na mhaka leswaku mavonelo yakwe hi wahi?","The correct answer is **C: Tiolimpiki ta 2012**.

Here's why:

The passage states that *despite* his personal opinion about women in fighting, Amir Khan will support British competitors at the 2012 Olympics held in London. This implies that regardless of his views, he is committed to supporting the event itself. Options A, B, and D focus on specific groups or achievements, while option C represents the event itself, which the passage explicitly says he will support.
"
Xana Peter Lenz u fe rini?,"The correct answer is **C: Exibedlhele**.

The passage states: ""u hundziseriwe eka xibedlhela xa le kusuhi laha a feleke kona"" which translates to ""he was transferred to a nearby hospital where he died"".

Hi le ka xiyimo xihi laha muhahisi loyi a chuheke a nga tshukaka a vuyeriwa hi ku twisisa matirhelo ya xihahampfhuka?,"The correct answer is **B: Loko ku nyenya ka vona ku haha swi vangiwa hi ku chava leswi a nga swi tiviki**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P)** specifically states that understanding how airplanes work and what happens during flight can help reduce fear rooted in the unknown.
* **Option B** directly aligns with this by stating the flyer's dislike of flying is based on a fear of the unknown.  Understanding how the plane works would directly address that unknown and potentially reduce their fear.
* **Option A** focuses on shame, which is not addressed in the text.
* **Option C** is too broad. The passage focuses specifically on fear of flying, not all forms of transportation.
* **Option D** states the anxiety is from unrelated fears. Understanding how the plane works wouldn't address those unrelated fears.
"
"Hi ku landza xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi mufambi loyi a rhandzaka ku pimanisa mitsengo a fanelanga a hetelela hi xona ku xi endla?","The correct answer is **B: Ku buka xihahampfhuka eka khamphani ya xona**.

The passage advises against booking a flight directly from the airline without first comparing prices across different airlines and checking their websites. Booking directly from the airline is the *last* thing the traveler should do, according to the passage.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini leswi vakhandziyi va rhangaka va swi endla leswaku kuma mitsengo leyinene ya swihahampfhuka?","The correct answer is **B: Ku pimanisa mitsengo exikarhi ka tiwebusayiti leti longoloxaka mitsengo**.

The passage explicitly states that you should research and compare prices from different companies before booking a flight.
"
Xana muheleketi u boheka rini ku fambisana ni ndzhwalo?,"The correct answer is **C: Loko swilo swi rhumeriwa tanihi ndzhwalo lowu kamberiwaka.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states, ""Ndlela yin’we ntsena yo hatlisa a ku ri ku rhumela tanihi ndwalo lowu kamberiweke.""  This indicates that to ship quickly (and presumably to have someone accompany the cargo to expedite the process), the goods must be shipped as checked baggage. The passage then explains that due to aircraft limitations, companies cannot send cargo unaccompanied.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Loko swilo swi rhumeriwa hi xihahampfhuka:** Simply sending something by air doesn't necessitate an escort. The passage states air freight can take days for customs clearance.
*   **B: Loko khampani yi tirhisa swihahampfhuka swa yona:** While large companies *may* have their own aircraft, the passage does not imply this *requires* an escort for their cargo. The problem is presented more as a limitation for smaller firms needing faster shipping.
*   **D: Loko ndzhwalo wu tameriwa hi khampani leyikulu:** This is incorrect as the main point is for companies that need to ship fast, as larger companies can own their planes and thus have faster shipping."
"Hi ku landza xiyenge lexi, loko u hlawula xihahampfhuka lexi u Fambaka hi xona Nkarhi Hinkwawo, eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi u fanele u xi rhangisa emahlweni?","The correct answer is **D: Xihahampfhuka lexi nga engetelaka malunghana man’wana**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that ""malunghelo lama nyikiwaka ya hambana eka minkarhi yo tala"" and that ""switici swo karhi swi nga hanana hi ndlela yo hambana ehansi ka swihaha mpfuka leswi nga eka ntlawa lowu fanaka."" This highlights that choosing the same plane repeatedly (""Xihahampfhuka lexi u fambaka ha xona ko tala"") is not necessarily the best strategy. Instead, you should consider ""malunghana man’wana"" (the additional benefits) the plane might offer in specific situations, which ""Xihahampfhuka lexi nga engetelaka malunghana man’wana"" captures perfectly. The passage also never mentions anything about point and usage.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi a nga tshukaka a nyika tipoyinti to tala to famba hi xihahampfhuka?","The passage states that ""stations might be more generous under different airlines of the *same* group."" This means the best answer is a different airline in the same group.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Xihahampfhuka xin’wana eka ntlawa lowu fanaka**.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka switwi leswi landzelaka hi swihi leswi nga tsanisiwaka hi ku byalwa ku tlula mpimo?","The correct answer is **B: Ku vona (Sight)**.

The passage states that excessive alcohol consumption can lead to:

*   Vuvabyi bya xivindzi (liver disease)
*   Ku fa matihlo (blindness)
*   Rifu (death)

Therefore, ku vona (sight) is the sense affected by excessive alcohol consumption according to the passage.
"
"Hilaha swi boxiweke hakona eka xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga kotaka ku hunguta vuyelo lebyi vavisaka bya byalwa?","The correct answer is **C: Ku nwa byalwa hi mpimo lowu ringaneke (Drinking alcohol in moderation)**.

The passage emphasizes the importance of drinking in moderation to avoid the negative consequences of alcohol consumption. Options A and B are explicitly stated as being dangerous. Option D is irrelevant to the context.
"
Xana ntsengo wa miako yi le ka xiyimo xihi eka leyi tlakukeke le Amsterdam?,"The correct answer is **A: Xifundza xa Canal**.

The passage explicitly states that the Canal District (Xifundza Xa Canal) is renowned for its historic buildings. Therefore, the concentration of significant buildings is in the Canal District.
"
Hikwalaho ka yini Xifundza xa Canal xi endliwe UNESCO World Heritage Site?,"The correct answer is **A: Ntikelo wa xona wa matimu ni mfuwo**.

The passage explicitly states the Canal District was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site ""hikwalaho ka ndhavuko ya xona lowu hambaneke na matimu..."" (because of its distinct culture and history). Therefore, A is the most accurate answer.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi endlaka ku endzela Phnom Krom swi va swa nkoka?","The correct answer is **D: Riendzo ra xikepe ku ya eka tiva**.

The passage states: ""Ku vhakela ndhawu leyi ku nga hlanganisiwa na riendzo ra xikepe ra kuya eka tiva."" (Visiting this place can be combined with a boat trip to the lake.) This indicates that a boat trip to the lake enhances the visit to Phnom Krom.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi lavekaka eka vaendzi ku nghena ePhnom Krom?","The correct answer is **C: Ku fika eAngkor Pass**.

The text says ""Loko u hundza hile Angkor swa laveka leswaku u nghena eka thempele hikwalaho u fanele u ta na phaspoti ya wena loko u ya eTonle Sap."" This means if you are going through Angkor, which you likely are to reach Phnom Krom and Tonle Sap, you need an Angkor Pass to enter the temple.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi sivelaka vavalangi ku endzela Antarctica?","Nhlamulo leyi faneleke i **A: Mali yo tala swinene yo famba.**

Muvalangi loyi a tsakelaka ku khandziya tintshava a nga endzela ndhawu yihi ya Antartica?,"The passage states: ""Mapfhumba yo hlawuleka ya le moyeni ya minkarhi yo karhi ya endliwa endzeni ka tiko, ka vakhandziyi va tintshava..."".

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Ndhawu ya le Ndzeni ka Tiko**.
"
Xana ndhawu ya languta swa le xibakabakeni ya xikhale yi nga ha tshuka yi va kwihi?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: Endhawini ya le kule**.

The passage states that modern telescopes are located ""emalayinini lama ya nga na swiyimo swa kahle swa atimosifiye,"" implying remote locations with good atmospheric conditions, unlike older sites which were ""emadoroba kumbe tikhempasi, leti kumekaka hi ku olova.""
"
Xana thelesikopu ya vulavisisi ya manguva lawa yi nga tshuka yi kumeka kwihi?,"Based on the passage, the answer is **D: Eka muako lowukulu (In a large, remote location)**.

The passage states that modern research telescopes are large instruments in ""emalayinini lama ya nga na swiyimo swa kahle swa atimosifiye"" which translates to ""remote locations with good atmospheric conditions"". This implies a location far from cities and human-generated light pollution, which eliminates A, B, and C.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi yihi ndhawu leyi nga vaka yinene ku va na siku ro rhula eribuweni?","The correct answer is **B: Mission Bay**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""Mabuwu ya Tamaki Drive ma kumeka eWaitemata Harbour, etindlwini leto durha ta Mission Bay na St Heliers le Central Auckland. Mikarhi yin’wana ti va-mabuwu lama taleriwaka hi mindyangu laha ku nga ni nxaxamelo lowunene wa switolo leswi xaxameleke ni ribuwu. Ku hlambela swi hlayisekile."" This suggests that Mission Bay, being a beach along Tamaki Drive and Waitemata Harbor, is a family-friendly destination with shops.

The other options are less specific or broad areas:
* St Heliers: Mentioned in the same context as Mission Bay, but Mission Bay is a bit better suited as the passage states, ""Mikarhi yin’wana ti va-mabuwu lama taleriwaka hi mindyangu laha ku nga ni nxaxamelo lowunene wa switolo leswi xaxameleke ni ribuwu. Ku hlambela swi hlayisekile.""
*   North Harbor District: This is a large region with many beaches; it's not a specific recommendation for a relaxed day.
*   Waitemata Harbor: This is a harbor with numerous beaches; it's also not a specific recommendation."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi kwihi laha swiyimo swo hlambela swi nga sirhelelekaka kona?","The passage states:

*   ""Mabuwu ya le North Shore... ma taleriwe hi sava laha ku hlambela kona swi hlayisekeke..."" implying swimming is safe at North Shore beaches (which includes Long Bay).
*   ""Mabuwu ya Tamaki Drive... Ku hlambela swi hlayisekile"" implying swimming is safe at beaches in Central Auckland

Considering this, the most appropriate answers are C and D. Between the two, C is a more accurate reflection of the passage because while Long Bay is mentioned, the passage explicitly states that swimming is safe at Tamaki Drive beaches in Central Auckland.

Therefore, the best answer is:

**C: Central Auckland**
"
"Loko u endzela ndhawu leyi hlamuseriwaka eka xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga langutiwaka xi nga faneleki?","The correct answer is:

*   **B: Ku tsalatsala exivandleni lexi**
*   **C: Ku endla mafenya**

Both of these actions directly violate the request to not deface the site with graffiti or trivialise the Holocaust.

Hi xihi xivulwa lexi ti hlamuseliki hi ku kongoma tindzimi to pfuneta?,"The most direct and accurate definition of auxiliary languages from the passage is:

**A: I tindzimi to cincacinca leti endliweke leswaku vanhu lava swi va tikelaka ku twisisana va vulavurisana**

This translates to: ""They are flexible languages made so that people who struggle to understand each other can communicate."" This aligns directly with the passage's explanation of auxiliary languages.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi mukhandziyi a faneleke ku xi kamba loko xikepe xakwe hi xixika?","The correct answer is **A: Ndhawu ya xikepe**.

The passage specifically advises checking the location of your cabin on the ship when traveling through the Northern Baltic in winter because the noise from icebreaking can be unbearable for some. The passage also mentions visa requirements and stopping in the city, but the primary piece of advice for a passenger is to check the location of their cabin.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xikepe xa mukhandziyi hi ximumu, i yini lexi va nga kotaka ku xi papalata?","The correct answer is **B: Ku famba eayisini** (Traveling on ice).

The passage specifically mentions that traveling on ice creates a lot of noise and suggests finding your room's location on the ship if you're traveling through the Northern Baltic in winter.  This implies that traveling on ice is something to be avoided, or at least prepared for.  Since the question asks what a passenger might avoid in summer, and ice is unlikely to be present in summer, this is the best answer.
"
Hikwalaho ka yini Xicatalan xi hambeta xi tirhiseriwa swifaniso ni switiviso eBarcelona?,"The correct answer is **B: A ku ri ririmi ro sungula ra ximfumo edorobeni**.

The passage states that signs are mostly in Catalan because it is established by law as the *primary official language*.
"
Eka tindzimi leti landzelaka hi rihi leri tirhisiwaka hi Metro ya le Barcelona eka switiviso swa ntolovelo?,"The passage states: ""Switiviso eka ti Metro swi endliwa hi Catalan...""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: Catalan**
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka switirhisiwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga taka xi nga tsakeriwi ngopfu hi ndhawu ya byetlelo ni xifihlulo ya xiyimo xa le henhla?","The correct answer is **D: WiFi ya rivilo**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on:

*   **High-quality linens and beds:** Emphasizing comfort and luxury in bedding.
*   **Exceptional breakfast:** Using seasonal, local ingredients and the owner's specialties.
*   **Historical buildings and ambiance:** Mentioning antique furniture, well-maintained gardens, and swimming pools.

While WiFi is certainly appreciated by guests, the passage emphasizes elements that contribute to a luxurious, unique, and high-end experience.  WiFi is more of a standard amenity these days, rather than a defining characteristic of a top-tier B&B trying to stand out. The focus is on handcrafted, unique and local experiances.
"
"Hi ku landza xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki yin’wana ya timhakakulu ta mphikizano exikarhi ka ti-B&B ta manyunyu?","The passage states that expensive B&Bs typically compete on ""swo funengela ha swona ni swakudya swo fihlula"". Let's examine the options:

*   **B: Swiphameriwa swa xifihlulo hikuya hi nguva** (Seasonal breakfast offerings) - This relates to ""swakudya swo fihlula,"" which the passage mentions as a point of competition.
*   **C: Swo funengela swa manyunyu** (Luxurious bedding) - The passage directly mentions the quality of bedding as a key competitive factor.
*   **D: Swakudya ni swakunwa leswi kumekaka endhawini yoleyo** (Locally sourced food and beverages) - The passage mentions ""swakudya swo nandziha leswi vaka kona hi ku ya hi tinguva endhawini yoleyo"" (seasonal delicacies local to the area), connecting to local food and drink.
*   **A: Ku sasekisa ka ntolovelo** (Traditional Decor) - The passage mentions the property itself, antique furniture, and manicured gardens as features of the B&B.

The passage does not directly mention traditional decor as one of the *main points of competition*. While decor contributes to the overall experience, the passage focuses the competition on bedding and breakfast.

Therefore, the answer is **A: Ku sasekisa ka ntolovelo**."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga taka xi nga khomeriwi eBeijing hi 2022?","The correct answer is **B: Mitlangu ya le ayisini yo khomeriwa eTaizicheng**.

The passage states that ice events outside of indoor events will be held in Taizicheng, and everything else will be held in Beijing.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga ta khomeriwa eBeijing hi 2022?","The correct answer is **B: Mitlangu ya le ayisini endzeni ka miako** and **D: Mikhuvo yo gimeta mitlangu**.

The paragraph states that Beijing will host ""mintlangu ya le ayisini leyi khomeriwaka endzeni"" (ice sports held indoors) and the ""nkhuvo wo gimeta mintlangu"" (closing ceremony).
"
I mani loyi a nga le khombyeni lerikulu to ngheniwa hi mukhuhlwana wa swinyenyani,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **C: Vanhu lava tirhaka hi tihuku** and **A: Vavalangi va swinyenyani**.

The passage specifically states that ""swo tala a swi katsa vanhu lava tirhaka hi tihuku, kambe na khombo ri nga va kona eka vanhu lava rindzaka swinyenyani."" (Most included people who work with chickens, but there is also a risk for people who watch birds)
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka swivulwa leswi landzeleka hi xihi lexi hlamuselaka kahle mukhuhlwana wa swinyenyani?","The correct answer is **C: Vavalangi va swinyenyani va le khombyeni ro ngheniwa hi mukhuhlwana lowu.**

Here's why:

* **P** explicitly states: ""...khombo ri nga va kona eka vanhu lava rindzaka swinyenyani.""  ""Lava rindzaka swinyenyani"" translates to ""bird watchers"" or ""those who observe birds"". Therefore, bird watchers are at risk.
* **A** is incorrect because the text states that ""swo tala a swi katsa vanhu lava tirhaka hi tihuku"", which indicates that the majority of cases are people working with poultry, but not all cases.
* **B** is incorrect because the text says ""eka vanhu ku vikiwe tikheyisi leti nga fikiki eka gidi"", which means the cases in people are not numerous.
* **D** is incorrect because the text states ""tin’wana ta tona ta dlaya"", implying not all cases were fatal."
Xana Lwandle Ro Basa–Baltic Canal ri hlanganisa yini?,"The correct answer is **C: Lwandle ra Arctic na Lwandle ra Baltic**.

The passage explicitly states that ""Lwandle Ro Basa–Balanti Canal yi hlanganisa Arctic Ocean na Lwandle Ra Baltic...""
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi yihi ndlela yo teka tipasi handle ko kavanyeta mukhandziyi?","The correct answer is **B: Switimela leswi nga ni byetlelo**.

The passage states: ""Eka switimela leswi u nga tlelaka eka swona, mufambisi a nga ha teka tipasi leswaku mi nga kavanyetiwi loko mi etlele."" This directly relates to trains where you sleep (which are trains with beds/byetlelo).
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana ID ya wena yi nga ha kamberiwa rini eka switimela swin’wana leswi tsemakanyaka mindzilakano?","The correct answer is **D: Exitimeleni lexi fambaka**.

The text states: ""Tindhawu tinwana ta switimela leswi hundzaka mindzilikano ku kamberiwa swi ri karhi swi famba... (Some trains that cross borders have checks while in motion...)""
"
Eka swilo leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi ngopfungopfu xi nga tshukaka xi endleka loko u ri endhawini ya tithiropikhi le Singapore?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku karhatiwa hi ku hisa ka dyambu** (Being bothered by the heat of the sun).

The passage describes Singapore as being easy to navigate and well-stocked. It also states that being in the tropics means you'll experience heat and sun. Therefore, option C is the most likely outcome of being in Singapore based on the information provided. The other options are unlikely because the passage says Singapore is easy to navigate, well-stocked, and doesn't mention anything about being robbed.
"
I mani loyi a nga tshukaka a lava ku papalata ku dya makhekhe ya le German?,"Nhlamulo leyi faneleke i **A: Munhu loyi miri wakwe wu nga ni rinyenyo ra timanga**.

Xivangelo: Xitandzhaku xi vula leswaku swilo swo tala swo bakiwa swa le Jarimani swi na tialmonds, tihazelnuts ni timanga tin'wana. Hikwalaho, munhu loyi miri wakwe wu nga ni rinyenyo ra timanga u fanele a papalata makhekhe ya le Jarimani.
"
Hi xihi xilo lexi langutiwaka hi fambisana ni nguva eka makhekhe ya le German?,"The correct answer is **C: Tiplum**.

The text says that cakes filled with fruit are common, ""with cooked apples, cherries and **plums** found in the summer."" This directly links plums to a specific season, unlike the other options.
"
"Hi ku landza xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki xibumabumelo xo famba hi ku pima matirhelo ya mali?","The correct answer is **C: Ku kombela mali eka vanhu (Begging for money from people)**.

The passage specifically advises against ""ku kombela kumbe ku dyelela vanhu van’wana leswaku va vuyeriwa"" (begging or deceiving other people for personal gain). Therefore, begging for money directly contradicts the ethical budget travel advice given. The other options are all consistent with trying to save money while traveling.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi swi nga n’wi tikelaka ku famba hi ndlela yo pima swinene matirhelo ya mali?","The passage states ""Lava nga riki ni mhaka ni nkarhi ni leswaku ndhawu yi njhani kambe va lava ku tirhisa mali yitsongo a va vone bajeti yo endza."" This means that the passage is geared towards people who are OK sacrificing time and comfort for the sake of saving money.

Out of the options provided, **B: Munhu loyi a tsandzekaka ku titsona swilo** (A person who is unable to sacrifice things) would be the one who would struggle with budget travel the most.  Budget travel often requires sacrifices in comfort, convenience, and experiences in order to save money. A person unwilling to make those sacrifices would have a hard time.

Therefore, the answer is **B**.
"
Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga yi hlamuseliki kahle ndlela ya le xikarhi ka Point Marion na Fairmont?,"The correct answer is **C: Mpimo wa rivilo a wu landzeriwi**.

Here's why:

*   **P** describes the road between Point Marion and Fairmont as having:
    *   Isolated stretches (""makhawati lama nga woxe"") - supports A
    *   Difficult road conditions (curves, narrowness, unclear turns) - supports B
    *   Strong cell phone service - supports D
    *   Speed limit signs, and advises following them - directly contradicts C

Therefore, only option C isn't an accurate description based on the paragraph.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi hi xihi lexi faneleke ku vilerisa vachayeri lava fambaka egondzweni ra Buffalo-Pittsburg","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: Ku jika swinene hi rivilo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions ""swiganga, swindlelana naswona minkarhi yo tala a swi vonaki ku u jika kwini."" This indicates sharp turns and curves that can be difficult to navigate, especially if you are unfamiliar with the road.
*   While the passage mentions 35-40 mph speed limits, this is presented as guidance that helps alleviate the difficulty of the turns, not as something that makes drivers nervous.
*   The passage states the opposite of B.
*   The passage does not talk about delays due to traffic congestion or construction."
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga lavekiki eka ntlangu wa canyoneering?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku tiletela loku nga nyawuriki**.

Here's why:

*   **P** states that canyoning requires training **kumbe** good physical condition (or). This means you need one or the other. Having a lot of training is not required, it says you need to be trained or physically fit.
*   **A, B, and C** are mentioned as activities involved in canyoning (swimming, good physical condition, and jumping).

Therefore, the thing that is *not* necessarily required is intensive training; the passage says being trained *or* being in good physical condition is sufficient."
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga lavekaka eka pfhumba ra canyoneering?,"Based on the provided text (P), the correct answer is:

*   **D: Vuswikoti byo hlambela (Ability to swim)**

The text mentions that canyoning involves swimming, climbing, and jumping. While training or good fitness is necessary, the explicit skill mentioned is swimming. The text doesn't say you need a certificate for canyoning."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga pfunaka eka loyi a hlelaka ku dzima tendze a ri emovheni wakwe?","The correct answer is **B: Movha laha u kotaka ku etlerisa switshamo**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ku etlela emovheni swa koteka loko u ri ni movha lowukulu wo tanihi vheni, SUV, Sedan kumbe Station Wagon lowu nga ni switulu leswi etlerisiwaka."" This clearly indicates that a vehicle with seats that can be reclined or folded flat is essential for sleeping in a car.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Ku twisisa swinene ku tsana ka movha wa wena:** While understanding your car's limitations is generally good, it's not directly related to making it comfortable for sleeping.
*   **C: Tende:** While a tent is useful for camping outside of your car, this question is about sleeping **inside** the car.
*   **D: Ndhawu ya munhu yo kota ku dzima tende:** Again, this relates to camping outside the car, not sleeping inside."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, lava dzimaka matende emimovheni va fanele ku papalata yini loko va lava ku laha ku nga riki na swikavanyeto?","The correct answer is **C: Ku dzima tende edorobeni kumbe etindhawini leyi tiyimeleke**.

Here's why:

The passage states that pitching a tent in a secluded area or city can easily attract attention. Therefore, tent dwellers should avoid such places if they wish to remain unobtrusive. Options A, B, and D are irrelevant to the point about attracting unwanted attention.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi a pfuxeteke Casablanca ra vumbirhi?","The correct answer is **D: Sultan ya le Morocco**.

The paragraph states: ""Sultan yale Morocco yi tlhele yi aka doroba tanihi Daru I-Badya naswona yi nyikiwe vito ra Casablanca hi va xavisi vale Spaniya lava sunguleke ndhawu yo xavisa eka yona kwalani.""
"
I vamani lava siyeke doroba ra manguva lawa ra Casablanca endzhaku ka mhangu ya ntumbuluko?,"The correct answer is **B: Maputukezi**.

The passage states: ""Maputukezi va ri hlaserile va tlhela va aka hi vuntswa ehansi ka Casa Branca, va tlhela va ri tshika endzhaku ko tseka tseka ka misava hi 1755."" This indicates the Portuguese abandoned the city after the earthquake.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana Sintra ri lemukiwe ximfumo hi ndlela yihi exikarhi ka vanhu va matiko mambe?","The correct answer is **C: Swibumabumelo leswinene swa Lord Byron**.

The passage states that Sintra's beauty was ""immortalized by Lord Byron,"" which made it famous among foreign visitors. This is the same as saying ""Swibumabumelo leswinene swa Lord Byron"" (Lord Byron's positive reviews/recommendations).
"
I yini lexi nga amukeriwiki hi Armenia?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: Rhiphabuliki lerintshwa.**

The passage states, ""Hambiswiritano, a ku na tiko leri yimeke - hambi ku ri Armeniya - leri ri tivaka ximfumo."" This means even Armenia does not officially recognize the new republic formed in Nagorno-Karabakh.
"
I yini lexi hambetaka xi kavanyeta vuxaka exikarhi ka Azerbaijan na Armenia?,"The correct answer is **D: Ndhawu ya Nagorno-Karabakh**.

The passage explicitly states that the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh (a region within Azerbaijan populated by Armenians) and the subsequent establishment of a new republic (unrecognized internationally) are the source of the strained relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
"
"Loko u tirhisa thekisi eCharlotte, i yini lexi nga vangelaka hakelo leyi engetelekeke?","The correct answer is **B: Ku va ni vakhandziyi vanharhu** (Having three passengers).

The passage states: ""Ku na ntsengo lowu engetelekeke loko vanhu va famba va ri 2, hikwalaho fambelo leri ri nga dura ku swi nga fanelangi."" This translates to ""There is an increased cost when people travel in a group of two, so this journey can be unnecessarily expensive."" While the wording is a bit confusing in translation, the implication is that *more* than one person incurs an extra cost, meaning three or more passengers would lead to a higher fare.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga tekiwaka xi nga ri xinene hi ku tshama ni vana eCharlotte?","The correct answer is **B: Ku famba hi thekisi**.

The passage mentions that taxis are not often used by families in Charlotte and that they can be unnecessarily expensive, especially with extra passenger fees. This makes taxi travel a potential downside for families in Charlotte. The other options are mentioned positively in the passage.
"
"Loko va le Spaniya va nga si fika, i mani loyi a a lawula xiphemu xa le n’walungwini xa Chile?","The correct answer is **D: Mainca**

The passage clearly states: ""Loko mfumo wa Spain wu nga si fika hi 16th century, n’walungu wa Chile a wu fumiwa hi mfumo wa Inca"".
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga endlekangiki hi 1810?","The correct answer is **B: Chile ri hlule Spain**.

The passage states that while Chile declared independence in 1810, Spain wasn't directly defeated until 1818. The other options are explicitly mentioned in the passage as occurring around 1810:

*   **A: A ku pfumaleka hulumendhe ya le xikarhi:** This refers to Spain's lack of central leadership due to the Napoleonic Wars.
*   **C: A ku lwiwa tinyimpi ta Napoleon:** The passage mentions the Napoleonic Wars as the reason for Spain's weakened state.
*   **D: Chile ri tivise ntshunxeko:** The passage clearly states that Chile declared independence in 1810."
Xana vanhu va nga fikelela miti ya le kule endhawini ya Liguria?,"The correct answer is **C: Hi xitimela kumbe xikepe**.

The passage states: ""Tindlela, switimela na mabyatso swi hlanganisa matiko xikaya lama, naswona timovha a ti koti ku fikelela ku suka etindhawini tin’wana."" This clearly indicates that trains and boats are used for transportation between the villages, and cars cannot reach them.
"
Xana marito ya Xintariyana lama nge ‘Cinque Terre’ ma vula yini?,"The correct answer is **A: Tindhawu ta ntlhanu**.

The passage states: ""Cinque Terre, leswi vulaka Tindhawu Ta Ntlhanu..."" which translates to ""Cinque Terre, which means Five Lands..."".
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i tibutsu ta muxaka wihi lexi lulameleke vuxaka lebyi nga vangelaka ku rheta?","Based on the text, the correct answer is:

**A: Tibutsu leti nga ni swirhendze swo lala**

The passage specifically mentions that some boots have ""nsimbi leyi engeteleriweke leswaku ti nga rheti eka tindhawu leti rhetisaka, leti faneleke tintanghu to tala ni tibutsu, ti endleriwe xirhendze kumbe xirhendze na solo"" which translates to ""added metal for grip on slippery surfaces, often in the form of cleats or coils in the sole.""  ""Xirhendze"" translates to ""cleats"" or ""coils,"" so boots with cleats are well-suited for slippery conditions.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi nga taka xi nga pfuni emapatwini ya ayisi hi xixika?,"The text mentions salt (calcium chloride), gravel, and sand being spread on icy roads to improve traction. It does not mention water being used for that purpose. In fact, water would make the ice worse.

Therefore, the answer is **D: Mati** (Water).
"
Eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi fanaka exikarhi ka Hawaii na Swihlala swa Cook?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti tirhisa nkarhi wa wachi lowu fanaka**.

The passage states ""Leswi swi tirhisaka nkarhi wo fana ni wa le Hawaii..."". This means they share the same time zone. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage says that the Cook Islands remind visitors of Hawaii *before* it had big hotels.
*   **B:** The passage doesn't say anything about either country having a monarchy.
*   **D:** The passage says that the Cook Islands do not have cities but does not mention anything about Hawaii not having cities."
Eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi nga hlamuseriki hi ku kongoma Cook Islands?,"The correct answer is **C: Madorobakulu i Rarotonga na Aitutaki**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Xihlala xa Cook a xi na madoroba kambe xi vumbiwa hi swihlala swa 15 swo hambanahambana. Leswikulu swa kona i Rarotonga na Aitutaki."" Which means Cook Islands does not consist of cities, however Rarotonga and Aitutaki are the largest Islands of the group. The passage explicitly states that the Cook Islands do not have cities/towns.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: Yi tsanana eka Hawaii** - The passage mentions that they are reminiscent of Hawaii ""before it became independent and filled with mega hotels"" implying it is smaller.
*   **B: I nongonoko wa swihlala** - The passage states that it is a nation of islands.
*   **D: Tiko leri ra le xihlaleni ri tirhisa nkarhi lowu fanaka na Hawaii** - The passage explicitly mentions this.
"
Eka tindhawu ta varindzi va swiharhi leti landzelaka hi tihi lexi nga ni mixaka yimbirhi ya byetlelo?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

The passage states that Sirena is the only ranger station that offers both lodging (a place to sleep) and hot meals, in addition to camping. The other options (La Leona, San Pedrillo, and Los Patos) only offer camping.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi kwihi laha u nga kumaka mpfumelelo wa le ntangeni loko u lava ku tirhisa mali hi ku kongoma ematshan’weni ya xikweleti?","The correct answer is **B: Puerto Jiménez**.

The passage states: ""U nga swi kota ku kombela mpfumelelo hi ku kongoma eka kwale Ndhawini ya Marhenja ePuerto Jiménez, kambe a va teki khadi ra xikweleti (credit cards)."" This indicates you can get a permit directly in Puerto Jiménez and that they don't accept credit cards, implying they accept cash.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i muxaka wihi wa ntlangu wa ku rheta lowu tlangiwaka eswintshabyanini?","The correct answer is **D: Ku rheta u ri ni bege leyi tikaka**.

The passage directly describes ""ku rhwala bege eka ntlangu wa ku rheta"" (carrying a backpack while skiing/snowboarding) and equates it to ""ku rheta eswintshabyanini, ku valanga u ri karhi u rheta kumbe ku hayika hi ku rheta"" (skiing in the back country, skiing while touring, or hiking by skiing). Therefore, ku rheta u ri ni bege leyi tikaka (skiing with a heavy backpack) is the type of skiing being played on the slopes.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga pfunaka vavalangi lava rhetaka lava lavaka ku fikelela rivilo ra le henhla?","The correct answer is **C: Swiyimo leswinene**.

The passage states: ""Loko swiyimo swi ri kahle u ta kota ku fika ekule ku tlula loko u famba kunene..."" which implies that good conditions (swiyimo leswinene) are helpful in achieving greater distance/speed.  The passage also mentions that a heavy bag is likely to slow you down. The passage does not mention that tibutsu leti tiyeke or tindlela leti lulamisiweke would help to reach a higher speed.
"
Vafambi lava hlangahlanganaka hikwalaho ko va eka ndhavuko wun’wana va tikeriwa hi ku endla yini?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku tlhela va tolovela ndhavuko wa ka vona**.

The passage explicitly states that ""Vafambi lava swi nga va olovela ku tolovela ndhavuko lowuntshwa swi nga va tikela nkarhi wun'wana ku tlhela va tolovela ndhavuko wa rikwavo."" This translates to ""Travelers who find it easy to adapt to a new culture may find it difficult to readapt to their home culture.""
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, ku hlangahlangana ku nga ha tika swinene eka mufambi wa muxaka muni?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Vafambi lava hatlisaka va tolovela ku hanya entsungeni**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that travelers who *easily* adapt to a new culture may actually have *more* difficulty readjusting to their home culture. This is because they have more fully embraced the new culture and shed old habits. The easier it is for someone to adapt to a new environment, the more difficult it becomes to revert to their old environment and habits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vafambi lava tikeriwaka hi ku tolovela ndhavuko lowuntshwa** The passage says that those who find it *easier* to adapt to the new culture are the ones who struggle upon return.
*   **C: Vafambi va ha ri eka xiyimo xa ntsako lowukulu** Although being in a state of euphoria is something that can be experienced by a traveller, it is not the experience directly connected to the difficulty of readjustment, according to the paragraph.
*   **D: Vafambi lava nga kotiki ku lehisa mbilu** While impatience might be a factor, the passage focuses on the *ease* of adapting to a new culture as the primary determinant of re-entry shock.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi vanhu va nga fanelangiki ku xi endla hi moose?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku tekela ehansi nxungeto wa xona** (Underestimating its threat).

The passage explicitly states that people get into danger by thinking moose are harmless and approaching them too closely. This means they are underestimating the potential threat the moose poses.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka swivulwa leswi malunghana ni moose hi xihi lexi nga riki ntiyiso?","Nhlamulo leyi nga riki ntiyiso hi leyi:

**A: I swiharhi swa vukarhi hi ntumbuluko**

Exiyengeni, ku vuriwa leswaku ""xiiharhi lexi vitaniwaka moose... hi ntumbuluko a xi levi"". Leswi swi kombisa leswaku a hi vukarhi hi ntumbuluko.  Leswi vuriwaka eka swivulwa swin’wana hinkwaswo i ntiyiso hi ku ya hi xiyenge.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi swihi leswi nga na khombo leri nga nyawuriki eka mufambi wa le mananga?","The correct answer is **D: Ku heta mati u ri karhi u landzelela miraji.**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that mirages can be dangerous because a traveler might pursue them, **overestimating their remaining water supply.**

Let's break down why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Ku pfumala swiambalo swo kufumela evusikwini byo titimela** This is a risk mentioned in the passage, but the passage specifically highlights the danger of pursuing mirages and depleting water and strength.
*   **B: Ku vona miraji leyi langutekaka onge i mati** Seeing a mirage isn't inherently dangerous. The danger lies in *acting* on the illusion.
*   **C: Ku heta matimba u ri karhi u landzelela miraji** This is a risk, but it's directly tied to and often a consequence of running out of water while following a mirage. The primary danger is the water depletion.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi boxiwiki tanihi nxungeto eka vafambi va le mananga?,"Hikokwalaho ka swivangelo leswi landzelaka, nhlamulo leyi lulameke hi: **E: Leswi hinkwaswo swi lavekaka**

*   **A: Ku pfumaleka ka mati:** Endzima yi boxa leswaku timiraji ti nga va ni khombo loko mufambi a sukela timiraji, a tlanga hi matimba ya nkoka na mati lama saleke. Leswi swi kombisa leswaku ku pfumaleka ka mati i nxungeto.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi vahi vanhu lava khumbekeke swinene endzhaku ka ku fika ka vavalangi?","The correct answer is **C: Mataino**.

The passage states that the Taíno population decreased significantly due to being conquered by the Spanish, and that approximately 100,000 Taíno were killed by the Spanish conquerors between 1492 and 1498. This clearly indicates they were the most affected.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi rihi rimi leri vulavuriwaka hi Makharabiya?","The correct answer is **D: Xiarawakan**.

The passage states: ""MaKharibiya a va ri vanhu lava vulavulaka Xiawaraka..."" (The Caribs were Arawakan-speaking people...).
"
I mani loyi a endleke leswaku ku rheta egambokweni ku duma tanihi ntlangu wo tihungasa?,"The correct answer is **A: Ski bums**.

The passage states that people who enjoy skiing on snow are called ""ski bums"", and they prioritize skiing by organizing their lives around it. This implies that they play a significant role in popularizing skiing as a recreational activity.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i nkarhi wihi laha ku rheta egambokweni ku sunguleke ku tekiwa tanihi ntlangu?","The correct answer is **A: Lembexidzana ra vu-18**.

The passage states ""Ku endla ntlango wa ku rheta eka gamboko eswirhelelweni swi sungule hilembexidzana ra vu 17 na hi 1861 clilabu yo sungula yi pfule hi vanorwegia eAustraliya"". This implies that it became a formalized sport with clubs in the 17th/18th century. Although the passage does mention the activity can be traced back to 5000 BC, this only establishes that skiing in some form existed that far back.

The opening of the first club in 1861 is too specific and happens to be more about the creation of ski clubs.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi fambisanaka ni xihlala lexikulu xa le ribuweni ra vuxa bya Afrika?,"The correct answer is **C: Swiharhi**.

The passage states: ""Madagascar hi xona lexikulu xa kona, naswona i tiko nkulu hi roxe loko swi ta eka swiharhi"" which translates to ""Madagascar is the largest of them, and is a country known for it's animals"". This directly links the largest island (Madagascar) to its significance regarding animals.
"
Hi xihi lexi nga riki xihlawulekisi xa swihlala leswitsongo swa Afrika Vuxa? ,"The correct answer is **C: Ndhuma ya ku va ni swiharhi**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Vuxaka na Furwa (Relationship with France):** The passage states that some smaller islands are associated with France, so this *is* a characteristic.
*   **B: Tindhawu ta vaendzi ta manyunyu to tala (Many popular tourist destinations):** The passage mentions that the islands are known as ""islands of paradise,"" implying they are tourist destinations. So, this is also a characteristic.
*   **D: Ku tiyimela handle ka matiko man’wana (Independence from other countries):** The passage mentions that some smaller islands are independent nations, so this *is* a characteristic.
*   **C: Ndhuma ya ku va ni swiharhi (Famous for animals):** The passage says that Madagascar is the island with the most unique animals but doesn't say this about the *smaller* islands, which is the focus of the question.
Therefore, ""Ndhuma ya ku va ni swiharhi"" is not necessarily a characteristic of the smaller islands of East Africa."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana Xilalelo xa Hosi xi tlangeriwa njhani ngopfungopfu hi tikereke tin’wana leti tolovelekeke?","The correct answer is **B: Ku endla murindzelo wa Mugqivela nivusiku**.

The passage states: ""Tikereke to tala titolovele ku khoma Xilalelo Xa Hosi hi vusiku bya Muqhivela wa mahelovhiki ya Xilalelo Xa Hosi, laha mavandla ma toloveleke ku tlangela ku pfuxiwa ka Kreste exikarhi ka vusiku."" This directly indicates a Saturday night vigil related to the Lord's Supper and celebrating the resurrection.
"
"Ku papalata swilaveko swin’wana loko u nghena aEcuador, muaki wa le Cuba u fanele a rhanga a va na yini?","The correct answer is **B: Papila ra xirhambo ra ximfumo**.

The passage explicitly states ""Ecuador yi lava leswaku vanhu vale Cuba va kuma papila ra xirhambo va nga si nghena eEcuador."" This indicates that an official invitation letter is required for Cuban citizens to enter Ecuador. The other options are either conditions or consequences related to the trip, but not a prerequisite for entry.
"
Xana i yini leswi swilaveko swa ku famba swa le Ecuador swi nga endleriwangiki swona?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku pima nhlayo ya vafambi yi nga tali**.

The passage states the requirements are for:

*   Organized travel between the countries.
*   Knowing how long a traveler will stay.
*   Ensuring passport validity.

It does not mention anything about limiting the number of travelers."
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga durhaka etikweni rin’wana ku tlula ekaya?,"The passage states: ""Maghilazi yo durha lama u nga ma kumaka kwalaho ma nga va na swiphiqo swimbirhi; ma nga ha va ma nga ri ya ntiyiso naswona loko ma ri ya ntiyiso ma nga durha ku tlula laha u humaka kona hileswi ma nga lo rhumeriwa.""  This translates to: ""Expensive glasses you might find there can have two problems; they might not be authentic and if they are authentic they can be more expensive than where you come from because they were imported.""

Therefore, expensive frames can be more expensive in another country. The correct answer is **B: Tifiremu to durha** (Expensive frames).
"
Hi rihi khombo leri nga vangiwaka hi ku xava tifiremu to durha eka tiko rin’wana?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti nga ha tshuka ti nga vi ta xiviri** (They might not be genuine).

The passage specifically mentions that expensive glasses you find in another country ""might not be genuine"". The other options are not directly supported by the text:

*   **A: Ku nga ha laveka xikambelo xa mahlo lexi engetelekeke** (An additional eye exam might be needed) - While possible, the text emphasizes getting your eyes checked *before* going.
*   **B: Papila ra dokodela swi nga endleka ri nga tirhi eka tifuremu tin’wana** (The prescription might not work for certain frames) - This is a general possibility with any glasses purchase, not specifically tied to buying them in another country.
*   **D: Ndzindzakhombo wu nga ha tshuka wu nga hakeleli swikoxo** (Insurance might not cover expenses) - This is a possibility, but the text encourages checking your insurance *before* you go, not as a risk associated with buying abroad."
"Malunghana ni ku tirhisiwa ka mali eFalklands, eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga ntiyiso?","The correct answer is **D: Handle ka pound ya le Falkland, pound ya le Britain hakanyingi i mali leyi amukeriwaka**.

Here's why:

*   **A:** The passage mentions that acceptance of credit cards can be unreliable and it's best to ask first. It does not say they are accepted everywhere, especially in remote islands.

*   **B:** The passage states that US dollars are accepted in Stanley, but doesn't exclude them from being accepted elsewhere on the islands.

*   **C:** This is true and directly stated in the passage: ""Swa tika ku cincisa mali u kuma ya Falklands loko u nga ri eswihlaleni, kutani cincisa mali u nga si suka eswihlaleni.""

*   **D:** This aligns with the information given that ""Ko tala Pound ya le Britain yi xava kun’wani na kun’wani eswihlaleni..."".

Since the question asks for the *most* accurate statement from the given options, and C is very specific and clear, and D is slightly less so in that it uses ""hakanyingi"" (often/mostly), and C is a more actionable piece of advice regarding currency exchange *before* leaving the islands, C is a slightly better answer here. However, given the options available, D is the *most accurate* reflection of the passage.

**Therefore, the best answer is D.**"
"Hi ku landza xiyenge lexi, loko u ya eFalklands ku suka eUnited States, hi kwhi laha ndlela yin’wana yo hakela yi nga pfunaka swinene ku tlula khadi ra xikweleti?","The correct answer is **B: Eswihlaleni hinkwaswo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that credit cards ""may not be accepted"". It suggests that while credit cards *might* work, they are not guaranteed.
*   The passage states ""Ko tala Pound ya le Britain yi xava kun’wani na kun’wani eswihlaleni"". This means that the British pound is generally accepted everywhere in the islands.

Therefore, bringing British Pounds is a more reliable payment method than relying on credit cards throughout the islands.
"
Hi xihi xiendlakalo lexi nga fambisaniki ni ku tlangeriwa ka swinkhubyana swa tempele?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku tswariwa ka ndlopfu**.

The paragraph mentions:

*   **Ku hlanganisa lembe ka tempele (Temple anniversary)**
*   **Ku velekiwa ka xikwembu (Birth of the deity)**
*   **Swiendlakalonkulu leswi katsaka tempele (Other major events associated with the temple)**

It does *not* mention the birth of an elephant as a reason for temple festivals. While elephants are part of Kerala temple festivals, their birth itself is not stated as a cause for celebration."
Xana tindlopfu to sasekisiwa ti nga voniwa kwihi?,"The correct answer is **C: Eka swiendlo swa le swinkhumbyanini swa le tempeleni**.

The passage states that decorated elephants are seen at Kerala temple festivals: ""Minkhuvo ya tempele ya Kerala ya tsakisa swinene ku yi vona, ni ntlawa wa tindlopfu leti khavisiweke ti ri karhi ti famba..."".  Temple festivals take place in the temple precinct, therefore the answer is C.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi yihi ndlela leyi tolovelekeke yo hlayisa mali ebindzwini kumbe eka hakelo ya xihahampfhuka ya xiyenge lexi nga durhiki?","The correct answer is **A: Ku yi tirhisa eka khampani ya wena (To have your company pay for it)**.

The passage states, ""Ndlela yo olova yo khandziya xihaha-mpfuka eka xiyenge xa xiyimo xa le henhla kumbe lexi xi tlakukeke ngopfu xa mabindzu i ku hakela mali yo tala leswaku u kuma lunghelo leri (kumbe, leswi swi antswaka, i ku kombela khamphani ya wena yi ku hakelela).""  This translates to: ""The easiest way to fly in a premium business class section is to pay a lot of money for the privilege (or, even better, to have your company pay for it)."" This clearly indicates that having your company pay is the preferred, and by implication, most cost-effective method.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga vaka ku tlanga hi nkarhi ku xi secha loko u buka hi ntsengo wa swiyenge swin’wana?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Swihahampfhuka leswi fambaka hi ku kongoma**.

The passage states: ""Hi ntolovelo, a swi pfuni ku langutela ku hunguteriwa nxavo wa ku khandziya xihaha-mpfuka eka xiyenge lexi tlakukeke ngopfu xa mabindzu kumbe xa le henhla eka swihaha-mpfuka leswi swi sukaka eka ndhawu yin’wana kuya eka yin’wana hi ku kongoma."" This implies that direct flights rarely offer discounts for premium classes, making them potentially less price-sensitive or more ""inelastic"" in terms of demand.
"
I yini lexi nga bohiki ku katsiwa loko u pimanisa ntsengo hinkwawo wo ya eAfrika swin’we ni ntsengo wa misava hinkwayo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ntsengo wa vhisa ya le Afrika**.

The paragraph specifically mentions to not forget to include ""mali leyi engetelekeke ya tivhisa leti ngetelekeke"" when comparing costs to Africa versus elsewhere.  This directly refers to the costs of visas *to* Africa. The other options are either not mentioned or are specifically mentioned as things to include.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini swilo swo hambanahambana leswi switolo swi sungulaka ku swi xavisa?","The best answer is **A, B, and C**. Here's why:

*   **A: Swakudya leswi se swi swekiweke (Pre-cooked/prepared meals):** The passage explicitly states that supermarkets are selling an increasing variety of pre-cooked foods (""Tindhawu to xavisa swakudya se ti ya ti xavisa swakudya swo hambanahambana swo swekiwa."")

*   **B: Timakhrowevhi (Microwaves):** The passage mentions that some stores are placing microwaves in stores to heat food (""Tin'wana ti veka na timakhrowevhi eswitolo kumbe ti lava tindlela tin'wana to kufumeta swakudya."")

*   **C: Tirhesturente endzeni ka switolo (Restaurants inside stores):** The passage describes the existence of small, often inexpensive restaurants within some supermarkets (""Eka matiko man'wana kumbe switolo swin'wana ku va ku ri na rhesturente yin'we endzeni ka swona, mikarhi yo tala yi va yi nga endleriwanga ku tshama u dyela kona naswona yi chipile."")

*   **D: Minxavo yo chipa (Cheap prices):** While the restaurants *are* often inexpensive, the overall *price* of prepared meals isn't necessarily being emphasized as something new the store *sells*. They are simply an option for people who can't or don't want to cook.
    
Therefore, the most accurate answer encompasses the specific innovations mentioned in the text.
"
Hi xihi xitirhisiwa lexi kumekaka eswitolo lexi nga tshukaka xi tsakisa khasitama lexi xavaka swakudya leswi swekiweke?,"The correct answer is **D: Makhrowevhi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that grocery stores are either placing microwaves in stores or looking for other ways to heat up food. This is specifically for customers who are buying already-cooked food and want to eat it right away. Restaurants inside the store may not be preferable to simply being able to heat up one's purchased meal. Therefore, microwaves are the most interesting appliance.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi nga tshukaka xi nga twisisiwi hi vanhu va le Beligium ni va le Switzerland lava vulavulaka Xifurwa?,"The passage states that while there are slight differences, French speakers from Belgium and Switzerland can understand standard French, including the number system. However, the passage does mention that some ""uncommon differences particularly in numbers"" exist between the French spoken in these countries.

Therefore, the answer is **A: Endlelo ro tirhisa tinomboro leri tolovelekeke eFurwa.** Even though they might understand it (as the passage says they learn standard French), it's the aspect that is *least* familiar to them, due to those slight variations. The passage only implies the uncommon number system would be the least understood aspect.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Marito yo karhi ya Xifurwa:** The passage says there are slight differences in vocabulary, but implies understanding.
*   **C: Mavitanelo yo karhi ya marito ya Xifurwa:** Again, slight differences mentioned, implying understanding.
*   **D: Xifurwa lexi hakanyingi xi vulavuriwaka eFurwa:** The whole point is that they can generally understand standard French."
Eka leswi landzelaka hi swihi leswi nga faniki eFurwa ni le Belgium kumbe Switzerland?,"The correct answer is **B: Endlelo ro tirhisa tinomboro**.

Here's why:

*   **P says:** ""Xifurwa lexi vulavuriwaka eBelgium na Switzerland ku na ku hambana lokuntsoongo na loku ku nga tolovelekangiki ngopfu ngopfu eka tinomborho ku na Xifurwa lexi vulavuriwaka eFurwa"". Which explicitly states that the way of using numbers differs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mavitanelo ya marito hinkwawo:** The passage mentions only slight differences in pronunciation, not all words.
*   **C: Xifurwa xa ntolovelo lexi dyondzisiwaka eswikolweni:** The passage states that people in Belgium and Switzerland learn standard French in school, implying it's the same as in France.
*   **D: Ku peletiwa ka marito yo karhi ya Xifurwa:** The passage doesn't mention anything about differences in spelling, just pronunciation and number usage.

Therefore, **B** is the only option that directly reflects information presented in the passage."
Hi le ka xiyimo xihi laha u nga tshukaka u nga nyikiwi mali ya ku loveriwa?,"The correct answer is **B: Loko u ringeta ku buka ekhampanini ya xihahampfhuka hi ku kongoma ematshan’weni yo tirhisa muyimeri**.

The passage states ""Eka swiyimo hikwaswo, u fanele u buka hi foyini eka khampani ya swihaha mpfhuka.""  This means you need to book *through* the airline, not directly, to get the bereavement fare.
"
Hi wihi leswi nga ntiyiso hi tihakelo ta ku loveriwa?,"The correct answer is **D: Ti fanele ku bukiwa hi ku kongoma ekhampanini ya xihahampfhuka hi foni**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Eka swiyimo hikwaswo, u fanele u buka hi foyini eka khampani ya swihaha mpfhuka.""
"

Hi xihi xivangelo lexi nga riki xinene xo tirhisa app leyi pfumelaka GPS ematshan’weni ya xitirhisiwa lexi tiyimeleke?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku ka u nga lavi ku vilerisiwa hi ku tirhiseka ka data**

Here's why:

*   The passage states a limitation of using GPS apps: ""Loko u nga ri na data eka foyinini ya wena kumbe loko inthanete yi nga tirhi kahle, ku tirha ka yona ku nga va na swipimelo kumbe yi nga tirhi."" This means data usage is a concern, which supports answer A. The other options (B, C, and D) are all listed as benefits of using a GPS app."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, u nga tiyisisa njhani leswaku u kume xikepe lexi faneleke?","The passage emphasizes the importance of using an agent familiar with Galapagos cruises to match your preferences to the right ship. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: Ku buka hi ku tirhisa muyimeri loyi a tirhanaka ni ku famba hi Galapagos**
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi swihi leswi nga tirhisiwiki tanihi ndlela yo kucetela vaendzi ku hambeta va gembula?","The correct answer is **A: Ku tirhisa swinene ku vonakala ka ntumbuluko (Making good use of natural light)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions the *absence* of windows as a tactic used by casinos. This is to disorient gamblers and make them lose track of time. Using natural light would be the opposite of this tactic.

The other options are mentioned or implied in the passage:

*   **B: Ku nyika swilo swo tanihi mathikithi ya mahala ya tikhonsati (Giving away things like free concert tickets)**: The passage mentions ""special food, drinks, and entertainment"" to keep gamblers engaged, which could include concert tickets.
*   **C: Swonwa swa mahala (Free drinks)**: The passage mentions casinos sometimes giving away alcohol.
*   **D: Ku tshika ku vekela tiwachi (Omitting clocks)**: The passage explicitly mentions the absence of clocks.

Therefore, only option A describes something casinos would *not* do to encourage continued gambling."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, mugemburi loyi a tlhariheke u fanele ku papalata yini?","The correct answer is **A: Ku nwa byalwa byo tala** (Drinking too much alcohol).

The passage explicitly states that experienced gamblers know it's important to stay sober because intoxication impairs judgment. Therefore, a wise gambler would avoid drinking too much alcohol.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xiyenge xa mbulavulo lexi tsariwaka hi letere lerikulu exikarhi ka xivulwa?","The correct answer is **B: Riviti**.

The passage explicitly states that proper nouns (mavito) and the pronoun ""Sie"" (which translates to ""You"" in a formal way) are capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga endlaka swi nonon’hwa loko riviti ri tsariwe hi letere lerikulu?","The correct answer is **C: Ku tsala**.

The passage states: ""hambiloko yi endla ku tsala ku tika hikuva u fanele u languta leswaku xiendli kumbe rihlawuri ri tirhisiwe hi ndlela leyi faneleke."" This translates to ""even though it makes writing difficult because you have to check that the verb or pronoun is used correctly."" Therefore, writing is what becomes difficult.
"
"Emalayinini ya le Malaysia, hi xihi xikoweto lexi vulaka “tanani”?","The correct answer is **A: Ku khotsa ritiho ra ku komba**.

The passage states that in Malaysia, specifically among Malays, the gesture for ""come here"" is similar to beckoning with a finger in some Western countries, which is ""ritiho ra ku komba loko u ri pfula u tlhela u ri pfala"" (closing and opening the index finger). ""Ku khotsa ritiho ra ku komba"" is the best way to express this idea in a concise manner in the given language.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xikoweto lexi nga ha vulaka “vuya”?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Ku tlakusa xandla xi langute endzeni**.

The passage mentions that in Spain, a British traveler might mistake a gesture with the palm facing inward (towards the person gesturing) as a ""come here"" gesture, even though it's meant as ""go away"". Therefore, raising a hand with the palm facing inward can mean ""come here"" in some contexts.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi vangelaka ku pandzeka?","The correct answer is **B: Nhulu ya gamboko leyi nga tiyangiki**

The passage states: ""Minkova ya gwitsi a yi yimanga eka ndhawu yin’we, kambe yi khuluka etintshaveni. **Leswi swi ta vangela ku pandzeka**..."".  ""Leswi"" in this sentence refers to the movement of the unsolidified glacier snow.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi i yini lexi nga tumbetiwaka hi mabuloho ya gamboko?","The correct answer is **A: Ku pandzeka**.

The passage states: ""Leswi swi ta vangela ku pandzeka, ku pfuleka swinene ka ndhawu leyi pandzekeke, leyi yi tumbetiwaka hi mabuloho ya gamboko."" This clearly indicates that fractures (ku pandzeka) are hidden by ice bridges (mabuloho ya gamboko).
"
"Hi ku landza xiyenge lexi, vafambi va fanele ku va ni vuxiyaxiya lebyi engetelekeke va nga endzela ndhawu yihi?","The correct answer is **B: Tindhawu ta le kusuhi na Goma**.

The text states: ""Hambileswi Goma yi hlayisekeke, maendzo hinkwawo lama endliwaka eka ndhawu leyi yinga le handle ka Goma ya fanele ya lavisisiwa leswaku u ta tiva xiyimo xa tinyimpi leti ti nga kona eN’walungu wa xifundzha nkulu xa Kivu."" This means extra caution is needed when traveling *outside* of Goma, not within the city center or to the volcano itself (though the volcano trip likely falls under the umbrella of needing to be aware of the situation).
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki xitsundzuxo lexinene eka vapfhumba vo ya eGoma?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku lwa loku nga kona le North Kivu ka nyanyula**.

Here's why:

*   **P:** This statement is the opposite of what the text says. The passage indicates that one must inquire about the fighting in North Kivu, implying it's a safety concern, not something enjoyable.
*   **B:** The passage states that Goma is used as a jump-off point for visiting the Mountain Gorillas, implying it's an attraction.
*   **C:** The passage specifically mentions using ""boda-boda"" (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma.
*   **D:** The passage mentions that the volcano Nyiragongo erupted and covered city streets. It also states that the city is used to ascend the volcano."
Xana mpfumelelo wo dzima tendze emalayinini wa siku ro sungula ra August wu ta kumeka rini?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti-1 ta April**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mimpfumelelo yi kumeka eka siku ro sungula ra n’wheti, eka tin’wheti ta mune ku nga si fika n’wheti yo sungula.""

To get a permit for August 1st, you need to count back four months:

*   July
*   June
*   May
*   April

Therefore, the permit would be available on April 1st."
Hi yihi pholisi leyi endleriweke ku sirhelela canyon?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku ni mimpfumelelo ya nhlayo leyi pimiweke**.

The passage states, ""Mpfumelelo lowu wu vekeriweke vanhu lava fikaka wu pimiwile, naswona wu kumeka hikuya hi leswaku hi wihi a nga sungula ku fika."" This clearly indicates that the permits are limited in number, and this limitation is intended to protect the canyon.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga tshukaka xi nga kumeka eka tihotela lexi hlamuseriweke eka xiyenge lexi?,"The correct answer is **D: Makamara lama ha ku lunghisiwaka hi ndlela ya manguva lawa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that the hotels have a ""lack of modern entertainment and some antique items."" This directly contradicts the idea of newly renovated modern rooms.
*   The other options are possible elements of these hotels:

    *   A: The passage mentions that famous people would eat ""exquisite dinners"" and enjoy the nightlife, so a fine bar is very possible.
    *   B: The passage states they would eat ""exquisite dinners,"" so a fancy restaurant is possible.
    *   C: The text states the hotels are often visited by celebrities.

Therefore, the only option that is unlikely to be found in these hotels based on the description is D."
"Hi ku landza rungula leri nga eka xiyenge lexi, eka swilo leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi vaendzi va le hotela va nga taka va nga xi rhangisi emahlweni?","The correct answer is **D: Makamara ya mitsengo leyi nga durhiki**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes luxury and exclusivity:** It mentions wealthy guests, famous people, fine dining, and sometimes even royalty staying at these hotels. This indicates high prices are expected.
* **Other options are supported by the passage:**
    * **A: Ku va ni fanichara ya xikhale eka muako hinkwawo:**  The passage explicitly states ""Nhundzu ya khale"" (antique furniture) is a feature of these hotels.
    * **B: Rhesturente leyi nga ni musweki wo hlawuleka:** The passage mentions ""swakudya swo lalela swa kahle"" (fine dining), implying a skilled chef.
    * **C: Ndhawu yo tihungasa ni vusiku:** The passage states ""hakanyingi a va dya swakudya swo lalela swa kahle ni ku tihungasa nivusiku"" (they often had fine dining and nighttime entertainment).

Therefore, affordable room prices are the *least* likely priority for guests of these historical, luxury hotels.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi faneleke ku papalatiwa hi vapfhumba lava endzelaka Greenland?","The correct answer is **D: Ku vitana muaki wa le Greenland u ku “Eskimo”**.

The provided text specifically states that while the term ""Eskimo"" is acceptable in the United States, it is considered offensive to Arctic peoples, especially in Canada, and visitors should avoid using it.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga tshukaka xi va xiphiqo eka vapfhumba lava nga swi lunghekelangiki ku endzela Greenland?","The correct answer is **C: Maxelo**

The passage states: ""Maxelo xo titimela kumbexana hi wona khombo leri munhu a nga hlanganaka na rona loko a nga ma lunghekelanga."" (The cold weather is perhaps the biggest danger someone can face if they are not prepared.)
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi sweswi xi tirhisiwaka tanihi plaza?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**

The passage states: ""Sweswi wu tirha tanihi plaza, naswona ku tshama ku ri bizi vusiku ni nhlikanhi,"" which translates to ""Now it functions as a plaza, and it is always busy day and night."" This refers to Jardín de la Unión.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga kumekiki le Jardín de la Unión?","The correct answer is **A: Gazebo leyikulu leyi nga ni switirhisiwa**.

Here's why:

*   **P: Jardín de la Unión** describes:
    *   Templo de San Diego (Muako wa khale wa vukhongeri) - **D** is mentioned.
    *   Tirhesturente to tala leti nga rhendzeleka ntanga - **C** is mentioned.
    *   Gazebo (no mention of additional facilities)
*   **Q: Callejon del Beso** describes:
    *   Kaya ha xitirho xa khale lexi rhandziwaka - **B** is mentioned.

Therefore, only option A is not explicitly mentioned as being found at the Jardín de la Unión in the provided text."
"Hi ku landza xiyenge lexi, eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga tekiwaka xi nga pakanisi malunghana ni ku hayika ninhlikanhi?","The correct answer is **D: Ku hayika ninhlikanhi a hi xiendlo lexi faneleke eka mindyangu leyi nga ni swihlangi**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Mindyangu leyi nga ni vana lavatsongo yi endla malunghiselelo lama engetelekeke, kambe ku tihungasa ehandle swa koteka hambiloko vari ni vana lavatsongo kumbe lava hariki eka swikolo swa le hansi.""

This clearly indicates that while families with young children need to make extra preparations, day hiking IS still a viable activity for them. Option D directly contradicts this statement, making it inaccurate based on the passage.

The other options are supported by the passage:

*   **A: Ku laveka ku tilunghiselela kutsongo eku hayikeni ka ninhlikanhi eka tindlela to olova:** The passage states preparations are needed for hiking.
*   **B: Mimpfhuka ya siyana, kambe yi endleriwe ku hlanganisiwa hi siku:** The passage says day hikes are completed in a day.
*   **C: Vanhu lava hanyeke kahle hi ntolovelo va swi kota ku tiphina hi sweswo:** The passage says people in good health enjoy hiking."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana hi rini laha siku ro hayika ri lavaka ku lunghiselela loku nga nyawuriki?","The correct answer is **A: Loko loyi a hayikaka a tiyerile emirini**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Swi lava ku lunghiselela leswaku u ya ku hayikeni naswona vanhu lava hanyeke kahle va tiphina hi ku hayika."" (It requires preparation to go hiking and healthy people enjoy hiking.) This implies that when the hiker is healthy (tiyerile emirini), they are better prepared and require less extensive preparation. The passage also states ""Mindyangu leyi nga ni vana lavatsongo yi endla malunghiselelo lama engetelekeke"" (Families with small children make additional arrangements), implying that families with children need more preparation than people without children.
"
I yini lexi hambaneke hi tindhawu leti tlakukeke le Rogaland kumbe Agder loko ti pimanisiwa na Norway hinkwayo?,"The correct answer is **D: Hakanyingi ti funengetiwe hi heathera**

Here's why:

*   **P** states: ""ERogaland na eAgder ti tiviwa tanihi """"hei"""" leyi vulaka misava leyi yi nga riki na misinya leyi tolovelekeke ku funengetiwa hi heathera ehenhla."" which translates to ""Rogaland and Agder are known as """"hei"""" which means land without trees that is typically covered by heather on top.""

Let's eliminate other options:

*   **A: Ti ni misinya** - This contradicts the passage which says hei (Rogaland and Agder) has NO trees.
*   **B: Ku hava tifjord** - The passage discusses fjords in Norway in general, not specifically related to the elevated areas of Rogaland/Agder. The question specifically asks about the elevated areas.
*   **C: Tindhawu leti tlakukeke hakanyingi a ti tlhandluki ngopfu** - This isn't mentioned in the passage about Rogaland/Agder. The passage only describes their typical ground cover."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga kumekiki le Norway?","Based on the provided text:

*   **A: Rivala leri pfulekeke swinene** - This is mentioned as ""vidde""
*   **B: Tindhawu leti nga ni mahlathi** - The text states ""vidde"" is open and **without trees** so this is likely the correct answer
*   **C: Tifjord to voyama swinene** - This is directly mentioned.
*   **D: Tindhawu to pfumala misinya** - This is mentioned as ""hei""

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Tindhawu leti nga ni mahlathi**. The text explicitly states that the ""vidde"" is *without* trees.
"
Xana hi rini laha vapfhumba lava tsakela ku rheta eka gamboko va faneleke ku endzela switsunga?,"The correct answer is **A: Hi xixika**.

The passage states that there are beautiful things that occur in winter, including some hill stations getting snow that allows for skiing. The question asks when skiing enthusiasts should visit the hill stations. Therefore, the answer must be in winter.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi rihi laha hakanyingi ku vaka ni vapfhumba vo tala eswitsungeni?","The correct answer is **C: Hi nkarhi wa ximumu xa le India**.

The passage states: ""Nkarhi wa vumpfhumba eka xitshunga yi tolovele ku tlakuka hi nkarhi wa ximumu le Indiya."" (Peak tourist season in the mountains usually rises during the summer in India).  Therefore, summer is when tourist numbers are typically highest.
"
I yini lexi u faneleke ku xi papalata loko u lava ku kuma xikepe laha ku lavekaka munhu?,"Based on the passage, the focus is on being proactive, networking, and making yourself known to find a sailing opportunity.  The passage emphasizes things like:

*   Offering help
*   Networking
*   Being communicative

Therefore, the answer that contradicts the advice given is **D: Ku honisa vahayiki van’wana va le swikepeni (Ignoring other hitchhikers on ships).** The passage encourages you to connect with others in the sailing community, not ignore them.
"
I yini lexi u faneleke ku xi endla etindhawini to yima swikepe loko u lava xikepe lexi lavaka mpfuno?,"Based on the provided text (P), the correct answer is **A: Ku tihlanganisa ni vatlutisi** (Contacting sailors).

The passage emphasizes the importance of interacting with people at the harbor, helping them, and making yourself known. All of this points towards the goal of connecting with sailors (vatlutisi) to find a ship in need of assistance.
"
Hi yihi ndhawu leyi nga tsakeriwaka hi mupfhumba loyi a lavaka ku tiva hi matimu ya xihlala hi nkarhi wa vakoloni?,"The correct answer is **A: Ribuwu ra le N’walungwini**.

The passage states: ""Leyi i ndhawu leyi makoloni yale Britain a va yi teka tanihi ya vona naswona loko u lava vumbhoni bya matimu ya ku tekiwa ka ndhawu hi makoloni, u nga sungula kwahalani."" which refers to the reclaimed land along the northern waterfront of Hong Kong Island.
"
Hi yihi ndhawu leyi nga tsakeriwaka hi mupfhumba loyi a rhangisaka emahlweni ku vona ku saseka ka ndhawu?,"The correct answer is **D: Waterfront ya le Kowloon**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Leswaku u vona tindhawu leti sasekeke ngopfu e Hong Kong, siya xihlala u ya eka ndhawu leyi languteneke na waterfront yale Kowloon"" which translates to ""To see the most beautiful places in Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the waterfront of Kowloon"".
"
Xana tisala tin’wana ti na yini leswi pfunaka ku hunguta khombo ro va nenge wu phasiwa hi swo khwakanyisa?,"The correct answer is **B: Swisirhelelo** (Safety stirrups).

Here's why:

The passage mentions ""switshego leswi hlayisekeke leswi hlanganisaka swilo swo seketela nenge wa mukhandziyi loko a tshuka a wa"" which translates to ""safety stirrups that incorporate features to release the rider's foot in the event of a fall.""  ""Swisirhelelo"" is the direct translation of ""safety features"" or ""protections"" in this context.
"
Hi xihi xiyenge xa butsu yo gada lexi pfunaka ku antswisa vuhlayiseki bya mugadi loko a tirhisa swikhwakanyiso?,"The passage mentions boots with heels and flexible outsoles as safety measures.  Of the options given, **C: Xirhendze** (Heel) is the part of the boot that directly contributes to the safety mentioned in the passage. The passage states the heel is flexible.

Therefore, the answer is **C**.
"
I yini leswi nyikiwaka vapfhumba hi fambiselo ra tindhawu to amukela?,"Based on the passage, the most accurate answer is:

**A: Byetlelo eka vaaki va madoroba lava rhurhelaka vapfhumba**

The passage states that the hosting systems connect travelers with locals who can provide them with a place to stay. The Couchsurfing example further illustrates this point.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi lexi nga riki ntiyiso eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka malunghana ni fambiselo ra tindhawu to amukela?","Impendulo leyi nga riki ntiyiso exikarhi ka swivulwa leswi i:

"Hi ku landza xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi a nga tshukaka a tshama ehositela?","Based on the passage, the most likely option is:

**B: Vantshwa va malembe ya 22 lava fambaka swin'we**

Here's why:

*   **P** states that hostels attract younger tourists, about 20 years of age.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Vatekani lava fambaka ni ricece**: The passage mentions that it's unusual to see families with children, suggesting it's not a common occurrence.
*   **C: Vatekani lava nga emalembeni ya va-70**: While the passage mentions older travelers can be found there, the primary target audience is younger travelers.
*   **D: Mindyangu yimbirhi lexi fambaka ni vana va yona**: This is even less likely than option A, given the passage's statement about families being uncommon."

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Chukele ra khokhonati**.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana vuvabyi lebyi tlulelaka byi hangalaka njhani?","The correct answer is **B: Tipathojini**.

The passage states: ""Ntungu lowu tlulelaka wu vangiwa hi pathojini..."" which directly answers how a contagious disease spreads.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi hikuya hi vutivi xi nga vangeliki vuvabyi lebyi tlulelaka?","The correct answer is **A: Ku tlhava nsawutiso**.

The passage states that infectious diseases are caused by pathogens like viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasitic insects. Vaccination is a preventative measure, not a cause of infectious disease.
"
Xana hi le ka xiyimo xihi laha ku hlawula purokizi ta web ematshan’weni ya vanyiketi va ti VPN ya munhu swi nga ringanelaka mutirhisi?,"The argument P states that personal VPN providers are better than web proxies because they handle all internet traffic, have better performance and service, and are difficult to trace. Therefore, web proxies would be sufficient for a user who **only needs to handle HTTP traffic.**

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Mutirhisi u lava ku fambisa hinkwako ku kwetlembetana ka inthanete:** This directly contradicts the reason why VPNs are considered superior. If a user *needs* all internet traffic handled, a VPN is better.

*   **B: Mutirhisi u vilerisiwa hi ku siveriwa hi nawu ni kumisisa rungula leri tumbetiweke:** Again, the argument states VPNs are more difficult to trace, making them better for bypassing censorship and anonymity.

*   **C: Mutirhisi ngopfungopfu u fambisa ku kwetlembetana ka inthanete:** This is closest to the ideal answer. It refers to traffic, especially HTTP.

*   **D: Mutirhisi u lava bandwith ya xiyimo xa le xikarhi ku ya ehenhla:** The argument states that VPNs have better performance and service. Therefore, a web proxy would be ideal for traffic that does not use a lot of bandwidth.

Therefore, the best answer is **C**.

I yini lexi pfumelelaka munhu ku tirhisa foyini ya khamphani ehandle ka ndhawu leyi a tshamaka eka yona?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku foyina hi ku tirhisa inthanete**.

The passage explicitly states that ""Tanihi leswi ku foyiniwaka hi Inthaneti..."" (Because of internet calling...) it is not necessary to use a phone company located in or serving your physical location. This is the core reason why someone can use a phone service outside their area.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga lavaka ku endliwa leswaku u amukela tifoyini tin’wana?","The correct answer is **A: Ku xava nomboro ya misava (To buy a worldwide number)**.

The passage states: ""Minkarhi yo tala, u fanele u xava nomboro leyi tirhisiwaka emisaveni hinkwayo leyi pfumelaka tifoyini ta PSTN ti ku foyinela."" (Often, you must purchase a worldwide number that allows PSTN phones to call you.) This directly indicates that purchasing a worldwide number is often necessary to receive calls. The other options are either contradicted by the passage or not presented as a requirement.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi hlamuseliki hi ku kongoma ku vitaniwa ka marito ya Xintariyani?,"The best answer is **B: Marito yo tala ma vitaniwa hilaha ma tsariwaka hakona**.

Here's why:

*   The prompt states: ""Ku vitana mavito ku olova ngopfu hi Xintariyane tanihi leswi mavito wo tala ma vitaniwaka hi ndlela leyi ya tsariwaka ha yona."" (It's very easy to pronounce words in Italian as most words are pronounced how they are written.)

Let's look at the other options:

*   A: Ti r timbirhi ti vitaniwa hilaha ku hambaneke na r yin’we - While true, this is *one specific detail* mentioned. The main point is the overall ease of pronunciation.
*   C: Marito lama nga letere c na g ma nonon’hwa - This is true, but it's also a specific exception, not the main rule.
*   D: Ku vitaniwa ka marito yo tala ka hambana hikuya hi xitwari lexi landzelaka - This is too general, while it is true for c and g, it is not true for the vast majority of words.

Therefore, B is the most accurate and encompassing answer.
"
Eka swihlawulekisi leswi landzelaka swa Izmir hi xihi lexi sunguleke emahlweni ka nkarhi wa ximodeni?,"The correct answer is **D: Malwangu ya thayilese ro tshwuka**.

The passage states: ""Ti boulevards leti anameke, miako yo vekiwa ngilazi emahlweni na tindhawu ta mavhengele ta ximodeni ti fuleriwe hi thayilese-to tshuka ta ndhavuko, makete wa lembe xidzana ra vu 18, na tindhawu ta khale ta vukhongeri ni tikereke...""

This implies that the ""malwangu ya thayilese ro tshuka"" (or tiled courtyards) existed alongside the 18th-century market and old religious sites/churches, predating the modern boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and shopping centers. The other options are explicitly described as modern.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki xihlawulekisi xa Izmir?,"The correct answer is **B: Xiyimo xa kona xi kombisa Turkey ya ndhavuko**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that while Izmir is in Turkey, it has a Mediterranean European feel, contrasting with traditional Turkey. The passage says ""hambileswi doroba ringa na moya wa Mediterranean Europe ku ri na Turkey.""

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: Doroba ri rhendzela ndhawu leyikulu ya swikepe:** The passage states that ""ri vekiwe eka ndhawu leyikulu ya le lwandle"" which is a port area.
*   **C: U nga kuma tindhawu ta mavhengele ta ximodeni ni tikereke ta khale:** The passage mentions ""tindhawu ta mavhengele ta ximodeni ti fuleriwe hi thayilese-to tshuka ta ndhavuko, makete wa lembe xidzana ra vu 18, na tindhawu ta khale ta vukhongeri ni tikereke.""
*   **D: Ku ni ndhawu ya swikepe ya vumbirhi hi vukulu eTurkey:** The passage states that ""ndhawu ya swikeke ya vumbirhi endzaku ka Istanbul."""
Rito hanami ri vula ku vona yini?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku rhumbuka ka cherry**.

The passage explicitly states that ""hanami"" refers to cherry blossom viewing.
"
I mani loyi a rhurheleke swinkhubyana swo sungula leswi a swi endleriwa ku vona ku rhumbuka ka ti-cherry?,"The correct answer is **C: Mufumi wa Japani**.

The passage states that ""mintlango yo sungula ya ku rhumbuka ka cherry a yi khomiwa hi mulawuri ntsena na van’wana va le vuhosini kusuhi na Imperial Court."" ""Mulawuri"" in this context refers to the Japanese ruler (emperor).
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka swilo leswi landzelaka xa Yerusalema hi xihi lexi nga taka xi nga tsakisi ngopfu vapfhumba?","The correct answer is **B: Xiyimo xa yona tanihi dorobankulu ra Israel**.

Here's why:

The paragraph emphasizes that Jerusalem's religious importance, historical sites, cultural aspects, and shopping areas are all attractive to tourists. The controversial status of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, while mentioned, doesn't contribute to its appeal as a tourist destination. In fact, it's noted that many countries and the UN *don't* recognize it as such, implying it's a point of contention rather than attraction.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga boxiwiki eka xiyenge lexi tanihi nchumu lowu Yerusalema ri tiviwaka ha wona?,"The correct answer is **B: Nkucetelo wa politiki**.

The passage mentions Jerusalem's historical significance, religious importance (as a holy city for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), cultural sites, and tourist attractions. While the passage mentions that many nations and the UN don't recognize it as Israel's capital, it doesn't explicitly elaborate on Jerusalem's political influence or power. Therefore, political influence is the least emphasized attribute from the choices provided.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mupfhumba wa muxaka loyi a nga taka a nga pfuneki hi ku xava Wild Card?","The correct answer is **B: Mupfhumba loyi a endzelaka Kruger National Park ntsena**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that a Wild Card is beneficial for accessing **multiple** parks in South Africa or **all** SANParks.
*   Therefore, if a visitor only intends to visit Kruger National Park (and no other SANParks), a Wild Card would not be financially worthwhile for them.
*   The other options describe travelers who would benefit from a Wild Card because they are visiting multiple parks or considering park fees, suggesting they might want to explore several parks."
Hi xihi xivulwa lexi nga yi hlamuseliki hi ku kongoma Kruger National Park?,"The correct answer is **C: Hi yona leyitsongo eka ti-National Park ta Afrika Dzonga**.

The passage describes Kruger National Park's location, size, and popularity, and mentions the Wild Card. However, it does not say that Kruger National Park is the smallest National Park in South Africa.

Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga vangaka ngopfu khombo eka vakhandziyi eka swiyenge leswi tlhandlukaka swinene swa ntshava?,"The correct answer is **A: Tindhawu to tsakama** (Tindhawu to tsakama).

The passage states, ""ku nga va ni nghozi ngopfungopfu loko ku tsakama"" (it can be especially dangerous when it is wet). This directly links wet conditions to increased danger. The other options are either aids to climbing (B and D) or features that require maneuvering but aren't explicitly described as dangerous (C).

Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga hlamuseliki hi ku kongoma xiganga xa ntshava ya Machu Picchu lexi hlamuseriwaka eka xiyenge lexi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku hava tinsimbi to khomelela eeka tona eka swiyenge leswi tlhandlukaka ngopfu.**

Here's why:

*   **A: Hambi kuri vakhandziyi lava hanyeke kahle va nga hefemuteka:** The passage states, ""Hilaha swi vuriweke hakona, langutela ku hefemuteka, loko u kandziya exigangeni...""
*   **C: U boheka ku hundza ebakweni leri nga ehenhla:** The passage states, ""Ku ni mabakwa lawa u faneleke u hundza eka wona loko u ri ekusuhi ni le henhlahenhla ka tshava...""
*   **D: Swiyenge leswi tlhandlukaka ngopfu swi ni khombo loko ku tsakama:** The passage states, ""...ku nga va ni nghozi ngopfungopfu loko ku tsakama.""
*   **B: Ku hava tinsimbi to khomelela eeka tona eka swiyenge leswi tlhandlukaka ngopfu:** The passage states, ""...exigangeni ku ni tinsimbi leti munhu a nga khomelelaka eka tona"" which means that there are metals that can be held onto in the climbing sections of the mountain. So the opposite of this statement is true."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi i yini lexi nga riki swakudya leswi tolovelekeke swa Majorcan?","The correct answer is **C: Tindzoho**.

The passage mentions that Majorcan cuisine consists of bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and that olive oil is used exclusively. Nuts (tindzoho) are not mentioned as a staple ingredient.
"
"Hikuya hi rungula leri nga eka xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xivulwa lexi nga riki ntiyiso hi swakudya leswi vuriwaka hangi?","The correct answer is **A: Hangi ya ku hisa loku humaka endzeni yi tirhisa maribye ya le xitikweni leswaku ku hisisiwa khele**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that sometimes the hangi oven involves heated rocks, and *in other places*, the heat comes from the earth. That means hangi using underground heat *doesn't* use rocks to heat the oven. Thus, statement A is false.

*   The passage states that some hangi that uses heated rocks can be found in Wellington. That means that statement B is true.

*   The passage stated that hangi is traditionally a special food. That means that statement C is true.

*   The passage clearly states that hangi in Rotorua is cooked using underground heat, which means that statement D is true."
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga boxiwiki tanihi ndlela ya ntolovelo yo hisisa khele ra hangi?,"The correct answer is **A: Gasi**.

The passage mentions:

*   Heating the pit with hot stones (maribye yo hisa)
*   Heating the pit with geothermal heat (ku hisa loku humaka endzeni ka misava)

Gasi (gas) is not mentioned as a method of heating the hangi pit.
"
I yini lexi nga vangelaka ku xiyiwa hi ndlela yo hlawulaka eka monk kumbe nun?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku ambala xifunengeto xa muvala wo vangama**

The passage states: ""...loko u te na xa wena, ngopfu-ngopfu lexi nga na mivala yo vonaka ngopfu, u ta kuma ku nwayitela ku suka eka monk kumbe nun enyangweni."" This translates to ""...if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.""
"
Eka swiambalo leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga tshukaka xi kumeki ku xi lomba eka monasitiri? ,"The correct answer is **A: Swikete**.

The passage states:
*   ""To tala ta tiyindlu ta ti monk ti na swo funengeta swa vavasati lava taka va nga lunghekanga..."" - This implies skirts are available to borrow.
*   ""Hilaha ku fanaka, vavanuna va fanele va mbala maburuku lama pfalaka matsolo. Leswi na swona swi nga lombiwa eka leswi nga kona enyangweni..."" - This implies pants are available for men to borrow.

While pants are also mentioned, skirts are specifically stated to be available for women who are not prepared, and *swifunengeto* is a general term for coverings, not specifically available to borrow. Shorts would not fit the need mentioned in the passage.
"
Xana hi rini laha muendzi a nga vaka ni nkarhi wo tala wa languta tinyeleti loko a endzela tindhawu ta le Antarctic?,"The correct answer is **C: Hi tin’hweti ta xixika**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the polar night (which occurs in winter in the Arctic and Antarctic) provides an excellent opportunity to see the aurora and stars because the sky is dark all the time.
"
Xana hi rini laha foyini ya sethalayiti yi nga taka yi nga sivi selifoni?,"The correct answer is **A: Loko ndlela ya sethalayiti yo tshuka yi siveriwa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Foyini ya sethalayiti a yi tirhiseriwa ku teka ndhawu ya riqhingho, tanihi leswi u fanelkee u va ehandle naswona eka ndhawu leyi sethalayiti yi vonaka kahle leswaku u kota ku foyina."" This means a satellite phone will **not** work if the satellite's line of sight is blocked. The other choices aren't reasons it wouldn't replace a cell phone, but rather situations where it might be necessary or applicable."
Xana hi rini laha foyini ya sethalayiti yi nga antswaka ku tlula selifoni?,"Hi ku ya hi P, foyini ya sethalayiti yi pfuna eka tindhawu ta le kule laha ku nga riki na tinqhingho ta le nyongeni. Leswi swi endla leswaku nhlamulo ya B (Hi nkarhi wa riendzo ra xikepe) yi va yona leyi faneleke, tanihi leswi riendzo ra xikepe ri nga endlaka eka tindhawu ta le kule e lwandle.
"
Ku simekiwa ka Transnistria Republic ku vangiwe hi lwetana hi yini eka leswi landzelaka?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **B: Mindhavuko**.

The text states: ""Hi 1994, ku nga twani loku ku endle leswaku van’wana va sungula Rhiphabuliki Ya Transnistria evuxeni bya Moldova, leyi nga na mfumo wa yona n’wini na mali kambe a ri tiveki eka matiko hinkwawo lama nga swirho swa UN."" It refers to ""ku nga twani loku"" (this disagreement) but earlier in the paragraph it states ""Moldova i rhiphabuliki leyi nga ni vanhu va mindhavuko yo hambana leyi a yi nga twani.""
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi Rhiphabuliki Ya Transnistria yi nga na xona lexi hambaneke na Moldova hinkwayo?,"The correct answer is **D: Muxaka wa mali**.

The text states that Transnistria has its own government and currency (mali), but it is not recognized by UN member states. This means its currency is different from Moldova's. The text doesn't indicate differences in language or religion, and it's implied that both regions have different political situations.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana hi rini laha muendzi a faneleke ku endzela Montevideo loko a lava ku papalata mimoya?","Xiboho lexi lulamisaka i **C: Hi tin’hweti ta ximumu xa Northern Hemisphere**.

Leswi hi swi tivaka hi swi teka eka xiyenge:

*   Montevideo yi le dzongeni wa Equator, leswi vulaka leswaku nguva ya kona yi hambana ni ya Northern Hemisphere.
*   Loko ku ri ximumu eSouthern Hemisphere (Montevideo), ku va ku ri xixika eNorthern Hemisphere.
*   Xixika eMontevideo xa titimela naswona xi na mimoya.

Hikokwalaho, ku papalata mimoya, muendzi u fanele a endzela hi nkarhi wa ximumu xa Montevideo, leswi endlaka leswaku ku va ku ri xixika eNorthern Hemisphere."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana hi rini laha muendzi a faneleke ku endzela Montevideo loko a nga ma rhandzi ngopfu maxelo yo hola?","The correct answer is **A: Loko ku ri ximumu le Montevideo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Montevideo is in the Southern Hemisphere, so its seasons are opposite to those in the Northern Hemisphere.
*   The passage also states that during the summer in Montevideo, it often gets hot (+30°C).
*   The question asks when a visitor who *doesn't* like cold weather should visit. Therefore, the best time would be during Montevideo's summer."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga fambisanaka ni loyi a mpfampfarhutaka emakhumbini leswi vitaniwaka girafiti, ku hambana ni ku onha nhundzu?","The correct answer is **A: Swiendlakalo swa girafiti (Graffiti events)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that ""masiku lawa ku ni vampfampfarhuti va tigirafiti va le nawini, mintlangu yo mpfampfarhuta ni makhumbi lawa va pfumeleriwaka ku mpfampfarhuta eka wona"" (these days there are legal graffiti artists, graffiti events and walls that they are allowed to paint on). This directly supports the idea of organized graffiti events being a legitimate, non-destructive form of graffiti.
*   The other options all represent forms of illegal or unwanted graffiti."
Hi swihi swiphemu swa minkhuvo ya vuyimbeleri leswi van’wana va swi tekaka swi ri swa nkoka eku tiphineni ka vona?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku ndzima matende** (Camping).

The passage specifically states that ""vunyingi bya lava teke eka minkhuvo ya vuyimbeleri va hlawula ku dzima matende endhawini yoleyo naswona vo tala va vona va swi teka ku ri nchumu wa nkoka eka xiendlakalo xexo"" which translates to ""the majority of those attending music festivals choose to camp on site and many of them consider it an important part of the experience"".
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana loyi a yaka enkhubyeni lowu u faneleke ku rhangisa yini emahlweni loko a lava ku dzima tende ekusuhi ni vuyimbeleri?","The correct answer is **D: Ku hatla u fika (To arrive early)**.

The passage states: ""Loko u lava ku swi vonela ekusuhi, u fanele u hatla u fika u ta kuma ndhawu yo dzima ka yona tende leyi nga ekusuhi ni ntlawa wa vayimbeleri."" (If you want to be close, you must arrive early to find a place to pitch your tent near the music stage).
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana hi kwihi laha vaendzi va fanele va ku papalata loko lava ku tihungasa ni vusiku le New Mexico?","The correct answer is **B: Etibarheni letitsongo edorobeni**.

The passage states: ""Tivonele: tibara leti kumekaka emadorobeni lamatsongo a ti hlayisekanga eka vaendzi."" This directly advises visitors to be cautious of small-town bars.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana hi kwihi laha muendzi a nga tshuka a kuma vuhungasi lebyi dumeke le New Mexico?","The passage states that casinos, especially the larger ones near Albuquerque and Santa Fe, offer entertainment. It also warns against bars in smaller towns. Therefore, the best answer is:

*   **C: Ekhasino ya le kusuhi na Sante-Fe**

Here's why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Ekhasino ya mpfhuka wa tiawara timbirhi ku suka le Albuquerque**: While a casino might offer entertainment, the passage doesn't specify that distance as a factor. More importantly, the passage talks about casinos *near* Albuquerque and Santa Fe.
*   **B: Eka pueblo ya le tlhelo**: The passage doesn't mention entertainment in pueblos.
*   **D: Ebarheni leyitsongo edorobeni**: The passage explicitly warns against bars in smaller towns due to safety concerns."
Vapfhumba lava xiyisisaka ku tirhisa ka vona mali va nga papalata swonwa swihi?,"The correct answer is **D: Juzi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Tijuzi leti endliwaka hi mihandzu ta durha kambe ta nandziha."" (Fruit juices are expensive but delicious). This indicates that juice is a relatively costly item.
*   The passage mentions that local beer and tap water are readily available and good quality, and while foreign wines are popular, the text doesn't focus on the price, just their fame.

Therefore, to save money, a tourist should avoid the expensive juices."
"Hi ku landza ndhawu leyi hlamuseriwaka eka xiyenge lexi, hi tihi tiodara ta swonwa leti nga tshukaka ti kanganyisa muphameri?","The correct answer is **D: Leswi vuriwaka flat white**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states: ""Eka vanhu va le Australia, khofi leyi cheriwaka meleke wutsongo va yi teka yi ri ya le ntsungeni.""** This means that a ""flat white"" is likely a common or standard order in Australia. Ordering ""what they call a flat white"" implies the speaker is not sure exactly what the local version is, which could cause confusion.

Let's eliminate the other options:

*   **A: Short black:** The passage mentions 'espresso', which is likely equivalent to a short black. There is nothing in the passage that suggest that order will cause confusion.
*   **B: Number One:** This is the name of a local beer, so it should be straightforward to order.
*   **C: Sauvignon Blanc ya le New Zealand:** The passage says that New Zealand wine is popular, so ordering it shouldn't be confusing."
"Nguva ya vukoloni yi sunguriwe hi ntlawa wihi, leyi tekeke malembe xidzana manharhu?","The correct answer is **D: Vaaki va Spain**.

The passage states: ""Tiko ra Spania ri sungule ku lawula matiko man’wana naswona ri endle tano ku ringana malembe ya madzana manharhu.""  This directly says Spain started and maintained colonial rule for three centuries.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi yihi ndlela leyinene yo kota ku tsakeriwa hi Vaperesiya?","The correct answer is **C: Ku endla hi moya wo rhula**.

The passage states that the best way to navigate Paris is to behave well, like someone who is ""bien élevé"" (well-mannered). It also mentions that Parisian impoliteness quickly disappears when you show them humanity. This implies a calm, respectful, and well-mannered approach.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga tekiwiki tanihi ndhuma yo tianakanya ya Vaperesiya?","Based on the provided text, the reputations associated with Parisians are:

*   Selfishness (yo tianakanyela va ri voxe)
*   Disrespectful (yo pfumala nhlonipho)
*   Hostile (yo va ni nkanu)

The text does not mention ""Misavu"" or ""Ku phuphurhuka"". Therefore, the best answer would be one of these. Since ""Misavu"" is not a common reputation, the best answer is:

**D: Ku phuphurhuka** (Flakiness, being unreliable). While not a direct translation, this is the closest option to something that isn't explicitly listed as a stereotype in the passage."
Hi byihi vuyelo bya Tlilasi yo Sungula eka MetroRail ya le Cape Town?,"The correct answer is **B: A ti talelanga hi vanhu**.

The passage states that MetroPlus (also called First Class) ""ya tsakisa ende a yi talelanga hi vanhu kambe ya durhanyana"".
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi lexi xitimela xin’wana ni xin’wana xa vakhandziyi xi nga na xona le Cape Town?","The correct answer is **B: Ntsengo lowu fanaka eka titlilasi hatimbirhi**.

The text states: ""Xitimela xin’wana ni xin’wana xi na matorokisi ya MetroPlus ni ya Metro"" which means each train has both a MetroPlus (First Class) carriage and a Metro (Third Class) carriage.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka i ini lexi xifuwo xi nga tshukaka xi nga xi endli?,"Based on the passage, the answer is **A: Ku vangela swirhumbana**.

The passage states that pets *can* cause allergies, spread poison, or cause illness. It also mentions that dangerous animals that can injure or kill are *not* suitable as pets according to the law.

However, the passage does not mention that pets can cause swirhumbana (which are warts in this context).

Therefore, **A** is the correct answer.
"
Xana makhadi ya tifoyini lama hakeleriwaka ma nga xaviwa kwihi?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: Eswitolo swa le khoneni**.

The text states ""Xitolo xin’wana ni xin’wana xi tele hi makhadi ya tifoyini..."" which translates to ""Every store is full of calling cards..."" Therefore, stores, particularly ""switolo swa le khoneni"" (corner stores), are where you can find these cards.
"
Xana mitsengo leyi antswaka yo foyini yi kotisa ku yini ku nyikeriwa hi makhadi man’wana lama tirhisiwaka?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: Hi ku tirhisa tinomboro ta mahala**.

The passage states that the service (of better international call rates) is ""often accessible by calling a toll-free number that can be called from many phones without charge.""
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka misinya leyi landzelaka hi wihi lowu nga talangiki ephakini ya swiharhi ya Mativa ya Plitvice?","The correct answer is **B: Oak**.

The passage states that the forests of Plitvice Lakes National Park are primarily beech, spruce, and fir. Oak is mentioned as being present, but not as a dominant type of tree. Therefore, oak is less prevalent than the other options."
Eka leswi landzelaka hi swihi swimila leswi tolovelekangiki leswi kumekaka ephakini ya swiharhi ya Mativa ya Plitivice?,"The correct answer is **D: Capercaillie**.

The passage explicitly states that ""capercaillie"" can be found in the national park. The other options are animals, not plants, and one of them (Honey Badger) is not found in the area.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana tikhowudi ta tindhawu ti pfuna ha yini?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Ku lawula vuxavi**.

The passage argues that the real goal of region codes is to give media companies more control over markets and make more money, not to stop piracy.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga mavunwa hi tikhowudi ta ndhawu lexi vuriwaka hi tikhamphani ta ku vika mahungu?","The passage explicitly states that media companies claim regional codes are meant to ""prevent piracy"". Therefore, the statement that media companies make that is FALSE, according to the passage, is:

**B: Ti pfuna ku papalata ku kopiwa swi nga ri enawini (They help to prevent illegal copying)**

The passage argues the real purpose is increased market control and profit, *not* preventing piracy. The passage says, ""Xikongomelo xa ntiyiso i ku nyika tikhamphani teto vulawuri lebyi engetelekeke eka timakete teto; hi ku endla ntsena mali leyi engetelekeke."" (The real purpose is to give those companies more control over their markets; to simply make more money.)

Therefore, the answer is **B**.
"
"Loko u fika eka tiko ra ka n’wina, hi rihi endlelo leri nga tolovelekangiki?","The correct answer is **A: Ku kamba vupfhumba**.

The passage (P) states that if immigration/passport control isn't done properly, controlling what enters the country becomes difficult. This directly implies that the *absence* of passport/visa checks is unusual upon arrival. The other options, while related to border control, aren't specifically highlighted as something that, if missing, would make controlling entry difficult.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi u faneleke u xi tiva u nga si fika eka tiko ra ka n’wina?,"The correct answer is **D: Loko nhundzu yo karhi leyi u nghenaka na yona yi pfumeleriwa**.

Here's why:

The premise P states that if you arrive without customs or immigration checks, cultural regulations can be difficult to enforce. It emphasizes knowing what you're legally allowed (and *not* allowed) to bring in.  The question asks what you should know *before* arrival.  Knowing *what goods are permitted* directly addresses the advice to understand what you're legally allowed to bring in.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as good:

*   **A: Loko ku ta va ni ku kambiwa ka vupfhumba (If there will be immigration checks):** While helpful to know, the premise states what happens when those checks *don't* happen. So knowing *if* they happen isn't the most crucial takeaway.

*   **B: Loko u boheka ku paluxa swilo leswi tlulaka mpimo wa mpfumelelo (If you are required to declare items that exceed the permitted amount):** This is related but not the core issue. It is linked to knowing what is acceptable or not. However option D is more broad and covers all items.

*   **C: Loko ku ta va ku lawuriwa ka swilo swo nghena na swona (If there will be controls on goods entering):** Like A, this is helpful information, but the prompt is about what happens *if* those controls are absent. So option D is the most correct.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i ku tala ka yini leswi pfunaka vakhandziyi ku hambeta va kuma tindlela letintshwa eka Nawu wa Cochamó?","The answer is **D: Makhumbi**.

The paragraph specifically states that climbers continue to open routes ""emakhumbini"" (on the walls). The other options, while present in Cochamó, are not directly linked to the continuous discovery of new climbing routes in the paragraph."
"Eka xiyenge lexi nyikeriweke laha, hi xihi xihahampfhuka lexi hlanganisaka tindhawu to tala le Southern Hemisphere?","The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that **Star Alliance** covers all routes across the Southern Ocean *except* the Santiago de Chile to Tahiti route.
*   It then mentions that LATAM (which belongs to the **Oneworld** alliance) covers the Santiago-Tahiti route, but only as a single, unique option.
*   **SkyTeam** is specifically mentioned as *not* having any Southern Ocean crossing routes.
*   South Pacific is a geographical region, not an airline.

Therefore, Star Alliance, by covering almost all the routes mentioned, connects the most locations in the Southern Hemisphere mentioned in the passage."
Hi wihi nhlangano wa swihahampfhuka lowu hlanganisa mpfhuka lowutsongo wa le lwandle le Southern Hemisphere?,"The answer is **D: SkyTeam**.

The passage states: ""Star Alliance yi hlanganisa hinkwato handle ka vuxeni bya South Pacific ku suka eSantiago de Chile kuya eTahiti... A ku na ntlawa wa swihaha mpfhuka lowu hlanganisaka tindlela tinharhu to tsemakanya lwandle eDzongeni Wa Misava (naswona SkyTeam a yi hlanganisi na yin’we ndlela yo tsemakanya lwandle)"". This clearly indicates that SkyTeam covers the least amount of oceanic routes in the Southern Hemisphere, as it doesn't cover any.
"
Hi wihi nhlangano wa vuvalangi lowu siveke Global Running Tours?,"Based on the text, the correct answer is **B: Go Running Tours**.

The text mentions that ""Lava vuyeriwaka eka mapfhumba ya misava hinkwayo yo tsutsuma va nhlanganise vatsutsumi lava valangaka ekamatikonkulu ya mune"" which translates to ""Beneficiaries of **global running tours** have grouped runners who visit on four continents"".  It goes on to mention Barcelona, Copenhagen and Prague running tours as examples.  This indicates that **Go Running Tours** is the overarching organization that encompasses these local tours.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, Go Running Tours yi pfuna ku hlanganisa mihlangano yingani yo hambana yo valanga?","Based on the text, the correct answer is **A: Mune**

The text states: ""Lava vuyeriwaka eka mapfhumba ya misava hinkwayo yo tsutsuma va nhlanganise vatsutsumi lava valangaka ekamatikon’wini ya mune."" (Those benefiting from global running tours have brought together runners who are sightseeing on four continents).
"
Xana mupfhumba u fanele ku endla yini loko a lava ku tshuka a vona xikanka?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku tirhisa swilo swo vona swiharhi swi ri ekule**

The text says: ""Minkarhi yin'wana tinghala, tikanka (cheetahs) na tiyingwe a ti swi lavi ku voniwa naswona ti voniwa kahle hi swilo swo tirhisiwa ku vona kule.""  This directly implies that using tools to see from afar is helpful in spotting cheetahs.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i muxaka wihi wa xiharhi lowu mupfhumba a nga tshukaka a hlanga na xona loko a famba hi movha ku valanga swiharhi?","The passage states that elephants and giraffes sometimes approach the vehicles closely. Lions, cheetahs, and leopards, on the other hand, are not always willing to be seen and are best viewed from a distance.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Tigirafi**.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga hungutaka ntsengo wa riendzo ro valanga?","Based on the passage, the answer is **B: Ku famba tanihi ntlawa**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Maendzo ma chipile loko mi famba hi mintlawa"" which translates to ""Trips are cheaper when you travel in groups.""
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi a nga tshukaka a kuma ntsengo wo chipa wa riendzo ro valanga?","The correct answer is **A: Vaendzi lava tiyimiseleke ku cincacinca mimovha**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that trips are cheaper when traveling in groups. However, it also says that individual travelers are often grouped together to fill vehicles. This implies that people who are flexible about being grouped with others (and therefore filling the vehicles) are the ones who benefit from the cheaper group rate.

Let's look at why the other options aren't the best fit:

*   **B: Ntlawa wa vanhu vanharhu:** The passage doesn't explicitly state if a group of three will get a cheaper price.
*   **C: Vanghana vambirhi lava fambaka swin’we:** The passage implies that two friends should try to join others to make a larger group to get a better price.
*   **D: Ntlawa wa vanhu va ntlhanu:** A group of five should be fine according to the passage, but option A is more generally applicable, because individuals or small groups will potentially get cheaper fairs by being put together to fill vehicles."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi hoxeke xandla leswaku San Francisco yi tekeriwa enhlokweni?","The best answer is **A: Ku hamba yi va kona eka mixaka yo hlaya ya vutshila ni lava vikaka mahungu.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Ndlela leyi yi kombisiwaka ha yona eka vuyimbeleri, tifilimi, matsalwa ni ndhavuko lowu dumeke swi pfunile leswaku doroba ni tindhawu ta rona to hlawule ka ti tiviwa misava hinkwawo"" which translates to ""The way it is represented in music, films, literature, and popular culture has helped the city and its special places become known worldwide.""

While the other options are mentioned in the text, they are not the *primary* reason stated for San Francisco's global recognition. Option A directly reflects the text's emphasis on the impact of artistic representation."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka i yini lexi nga riki ntiyiso hi San Francisco?","The correct answer is **D: Ikhonomi ya kona yi titshege hi vupfhumba hi ku helela**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that San Francisco's economy is *influenced* by being a tourist destination, but it *doesn't* depend *entirely* on it. The passage mentions other major sectors like professional services, government, finance, and retail.
*   The other options (A, B, and C) are all explicitly stated in the passage."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i muxaka wihi wa mupfhumba loyi a nga tshukaka a nga vuyeriwi hi ku tirhisa vukorhokeri bya muyimeri wa swo famba?","Mpfumawulo lowu nga lowona hi: **B: Mupfhumba loyi a endlaka xiboho hi xihatla**

Xivangelo:

Eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi nga boxiwangiki eka xiyenge lexi tanihi vuyelo bya ku buma hi ku tirhisa muyimeri wa vupfhumba?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku hatlisisiwa ka mapapila yo famba** (The expediting of travel documents).

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that travel agents can book flights and offer packages including meals, transportation to/from the airport, and hotel stays.
*   The passage also mentions that travel agents may hold reservations.

The passage doesn't mention anything about assisting with speeding up passport or visa applications."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana switirhisiwa leswi kotaka ku hundzuluxela tsalwa swi tsandzeka ku endla yini?","The correct answer is **D: Ku hundzuluxela hi ku pakanisa ka 100%**.

The passage states that translation engines are quite advanced and often translate well, *but you should still be careful, as they can translate incorrectly*. This indicates that they are not always 100% accurate. The other options are things the passage suggests they *can* do.
"
I yini lexi pfumelelaka vuhundzuluxeri ku endliwa u nga pfulanga inthanete?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku dawuniloda rungula ra ririmi** (Downloading language data).

The passage explicitly states: ""Google Translate, leyi yi ku pfumelelaka leswaku u hundzuluxeriwa hambiloko u nga nghenanga eka inthanete endzhaku ka ku **dawunilowda data ya ririmi** leri u ri lavaka."" (Google Translate, which allows you to translate even when you are not connected to the internet after **downloading the language data** you need.)
"
Eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi nga vangeliki ku wa ka gamboko?,"The passage states the following can cause an avalanche:

*   Sun heating the snow
*   Falling snow
*   Other natural events
*   Humans

The passage says that **snow sticking** leads to avalanches.

Therefore, the answer is **A: Gamboko leyi tiyeke (Solid snow)** because the passage states that the problem is that the snow sticks, and that is why it needs to be triggered to fall. The other options are mentioned as causes of avalanches."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi waka tanihi kuwa ka gamboko?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: Gamboko leyi engetelekeke erigiyagiyeni (Gamboko leyi engetelekeke erigiyagiyeni)**

The passage states that when the accumulation of snow exceeds what the area can hold, the excess falls as snow (or an avalanche of snow). Therefore, the excess snow that builds up on the slope falls as an avalanche.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, kheri yi endliwa hi swilo swihi?","The correct answer is **B: Mintsembyana ni swipayisisi**

The passage states: ""Kheri i swakudya leswi endliwaka hi nyama kumbe matsavu naswona swi cheriwa swipayisisi ni mintsembyana.""  This directly translates to: ""Kheri is a dish made with meat or vegetables and seasoned with spices and herbs.""

While the passage also mentions yogurt and coconut milk as ingredients used in *some* regional variations, *spices and herbs* are mentioned as a universal ingredient.
"
"Eka tindhawu tin’wana, ntswamba wa khokhonati wu pfa wu tirhiseriwa nchumu wihi eka kheri?","The correct answer is **C: Yogati**.

The text states that in northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is used to cook kheri, while in southern India and other regions, coconut milk is often used. This implies that coconut milk is used as a substitute for yogurt in some kheri recipes.
"
Hikwalaho ka yini ndlela yi fanele ku rhendzeleka Tintshava Ta Transantarctic ku fika erivaleni leri tlakukeke?,"The correct answer is **B: Gamboko leyi manyaneke yi ni khombo**.

The passage states that the ice is ""manyaneke yi thlela yi pandzeka leyi hoxiweke mijeko,"" implying it is dangerous. This is the reason the route must detour around the Transantarctic Mountains to reach higher, presumably safer, ground.
"
"Ku longoloka na South Pole Traverse, i yini leswi funghiweke hi mijeko?","The correct answer is **C: Mabakwa lama taleke gamboko**.

The passage states ""Gamboko ya yona leyi manyaneke yi thlela yi pandzeka leyi hoxiweke mijeko.""  This means the cracks and crevices in the ice/snow are marked with flags. While the route is important and followed by vehicles, it's the dangerous crevasses themselves that are directly marked.
"
I yini lexi nga boxiwangiki eka xiyenge lexi vapfhumba va faneleke va pfa va xi lemuka loko va valanga eDzongeni wa Afrika?,"The correct answer is **A: Matiko yo hambana ma ni swilaveko leswi nga faniki swa Tivhisa**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly mentions visa requirements**: It states: ""Swilaveko swa vhisa ni timali ta kona swi titshege hi tiko naswona swi susumetiwa hi tiko leri u humaka eka rona."" (Visa requirements and their costs depend on the country and are influenced by the country you come from).
*   **The other options are also mentioned:**
    *   B: ""Ku nghena eDzongeni wa Afrika hi movha I ndlela leyi hlamarisaka yo vona ku saseka ka ndhawu leyi..."" (Entering Southern Africa by car is a wonderful way to see the beauty of the area...).
    *   C: ""...hambileswi Dzonga wa Afrika wu tiyeke matiko yale kusuhi na yona a ma tiyangi."" (...although Southern Africa is stable, the neighboring countries are not).
    *   D: ""...4x4 yi ringanyetiwa ngopfu naswona tindhawu to tala ti fikeleleka hi movha wa 4x4 wa mavhilwa yale henhla."" (...4x4 is highly recommended and many places are accessible by a high wheel drive 4x4 vehicle).

Therefore, option A is the one that is not mentioned in the text."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga tekiwaka xi ri xi xitsundzuxo xo biha eka vapfhumba loko lavaka ku valanga Dzonga wa Afrika hi movha?","The correct answer is **D: Matiko man’wana lama akelaneke eDzongeni wa Afrika a hi manene ku ma endzela**

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Swi veki emiehleketweni loko u ri karhi u kunguhate leswaku hambileswi Dzonga wa Afrika wu tiyeke matiko yale kusuhi na yona a ma tiyangi."" This translates to: ""Keep in mind when planning that while Southern Africa is stable, the countries around it are not."" This is a warning, as it implies potential instability or risk in neighboring countries. The phrase ""a ma tiyangi"" is open to interpretation, but the most likely meaning is the countries are not as stable, and not as safe."
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi boxiweke eka xiyenge lexi tanihi khombo loko u siya mindzhwalo ya wena yi nga ri na munhu?,"The correct answer is **D: Valawuri va nga ha yi languti tanihi nxungeto wa bomo**

The passage states: ""Tibege leti vonakaka ti nga ri na vini ti yiviwa ngopfu nakambe maphorisa ma ti ehleketelela leswaku ti nga va ti ri na tibomo."" This directly translates to bags that appear unattended are often stolen and also police suspect they might contain bombs.
"
I yini lexi nga boxiwiki eka xiyenge lexi malunghana ni ku famba ni xidzidzirisi?,"The correct answer is **D: Valawuri va nga ha teka mindzhwalo ya wena, hambiloko u nga tamelanga swidzidzirisi**

Here's why:

*   The paragraph discusses the dangers of unknowingly carrying drugs for others and the consequences. It also mentions the possibility of lost bags being suspected of containing bombs and being confiscated. It does not discuss authorities taking your belongings even when you are not carrying any illegal items.
*   Options A, B, and C are all explicitly mentioned in the paragraph.
"
I xonwa xihi lexi nga boxiwangiki lexi u nga ringeta ku xi endla ekaya loko u wisile?,"The correct answer is **C: Byala (Beer)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions coffee, tea, and juices as options for drinks to try.
*   While it mentions bars and clubs, which may serve beer, it doesn't directly suggest making beer at home. The other drinks are suggested as things you can make yourself.
* Byala means beer in Xitsonga language."
Eka leswi landzelaka hi kwihi laha u fanele ku endzela kona loko u endzela ndhawu laha u tshamaka kona ku ya nwa swonwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Switolo swa kofi ekulenyana ni laha u tshamaka kona**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly recommends trying different coffees when visiting local places: ""Loko u vhakela tindhawu ta laha u tshamaka kona u va ni nkarhi wo ringeta tikofi to hambanahambana."" This directly translates to trying coffees in your local area.
* While the passage also mentions juice and new bars/clubs, the primary focus in the context of *visiting local places and trying drinks* is on coffee.
"
Xana swifaniso swa matuva swi kumeka kwihi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ejarateni ra kereke**

The passage states: ""Eka jarata ra kereke, ku na swifaniso swo tsakisa swa matuva..."" which translates to ""In the church graveyard, there are interesting sculptures of doves...""
"
Hi wihi muxaka wa vhisa lowu nga ha lavaka leswaku munhu a nyika vumbhoni bya leswaku u ni mali leri ringaneke?,"The correct answer is **D: Vhisa ya xichudeni**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Eka matiko yo tala, u ta lava papila ra xikolo lexi u nga tsakela ku dyondza eka xona, na vumbhoni bya mali leyi yi nga ta ku hlayisa eka lembe ro sungula ra tidyondzo ta wena."" This indicates that a student visa often requires proof of sufficient funds.
"
I mani loyi a nga tshukaka a lava ku va ni vhisa yo leha?,"The correct answer is **C: Xichudeni xa le ka tiko rimbe** (Foreign student).

The passage specifically states that studying in a country for a longer period usually requires obtaining a visa in advance, and that student visas have different requirements than tourist or business visas. The passage also mentions the need for an acceptance letter from a school and proof of sufficient funds for the first year of study, which are specific to student visas.
"
Hi rini laha ngopfungopfu u fanele ku xiyaxiya tinsuna?,"The best answer is **A: Hi tin’hweti ta ximumu**.

The passage specifically states that you need to be most careful of ticks in the summer (""Ngopfu ngopfu eka ximumu, ku ta laveka u tivonela eka tinsuna...""). While the other options are related to the risk of encountering ticks, summer is explicitly mentioned as the time of greatest concern.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi u faneleke u papalata ku xi endla leswaku u nga karhatiwi hi tinsuna loko u chayela ekhwatini?","The correct answer is **A: Ku tshika tinyangwa ta movha ti pfuriwile nkarhi wo leha.**

The passage states that even a few seconds with the car doors open is enough time for ticks to get inside. Therefore, leaving the doors open for extended periods is what should be avoided.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki ntiyiso hi Vasundarban?","The correct answer is **B: Hafu ya ndhawu ya kona hinkwayo i nhlangasi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""n’we xa nharhu ku nga mati kumbe nhangasi,"" which translates to ""one third is water or swamps"". This is not half.

Let's look at why the other options are true according to the passage:

*   **A: Ku ni makhwati ma nga ri mangani lama saleke** - *Khwati a ri endliwanga hi ti mangrove ntsena—swi katsa man’wana ya masalela ya nhova ya matimba...* This tells us that it includes remnants of forests that were previously much larger and this is true, there are only a few forests remaining.
*   **C: I ndhawu leyikulu swinene emisaveni ya bandhi ra mangrove** - *Vasundarban hi vona vo tala eka bandhi ra mangrove...*, which means that the Vasundarban is one of the largest in the world.
*   **D: Ku na timhala to tala ku tlula tiyingwe ta le Bengal** - The passage states *...ku ringanyetiwa leswaku sweswi ku na 400 wa ti yingwe tale Bengal tale Vuhosini ni kwalomu ka 30,000 wa ti mhala leti voniweke.*, this confirms that there are more deer than tigers."
Hi xihi xiphemu xa khwati lexi nga endhawini ya India?,"The correct answer is **A: Sundarbans National Park**.

The passage states: ""Tlhelo ra khwati leri welaka etikweni ra Indiya ri vitaniwe Sundarbans National Park."" (The part of the forest that falls within India is called Sundarbans National Park).
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi a nga tshukaka a nga ri twisisi ngopfu ririmi ra Xinghezi?","Based on the passage, the answer is **B: Vanhu lava nga vantshwa hi malembe (People who are young in years)**.

The passage states: ""...eka matiko yo tala vanhu va kona va xi vulavula kahle Xilungu, kambe u nga kuma leswaku a va na vutivi byo tala ngopfungopfu vanhu lavatsongo (in many countries people there speak English well, but you may find they don't have much knowledge especially young people)"".
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga tikaka ku xi vitana?","The correct answer is **D: Marito lama tikaka ku ma vula ya ndhawu**.

The passage states that it is often easier to understand written words than spoken words, ""ngopfungopfu eka marito lama mikarhi yo tala ma tikaka ku ma vula kahle."" This directly relates to the difficulty in pronouncing regional words or slang, as exemplified by the people from Manchester, Boston, and Sydney using their local expressions.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xiyimo lexi nga vaka xinene eka mupfhumba loyi a hlelaka ku famba hi bazi ku suka exitichini xa le ndzeni ka xifundzha?","Mhlamulo lowu lulameke i **D: Mupfhumba u ya evuxeni ivi a fika exitichini emahlweni ka 6:20**.

Hi leswi ha yini:

*   **Pfungulo:** Xitici xa mabazi xi na mabazi yo tala lama yaka evuxeni exikarhi ka 06:30 na 07:30.
*   **Pfungulo:** Mabazi lama nghenaka eka xifundza nkarhi wunwana ya tala.
*   **Leswi swi vula:** Loko mupfhumba a lava ku ya evuxeni, u fanele a fika exitichini ka ha ri emahlweni ka 06:30 ku tiyisekisa leswaku u kuma xitulu eka bazi naswona a nga saleli endzhaku. Xihlawulekiso xa D hi xona ntsena lexi kombisaka leswi."
Hi xihi xitsundzuxo lexi nga vaka xinene eka muendzi loyi a lavaka ku ya evuxeni ku suka exichini xa bazi xa le ndzeni ka xifundzha?,"The correct answer is **B: Xava thikithi ka ha ri emahlweni (Buy a ticket in advance)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Tanihi leswi mabazi lama nghenaka eka xifundza nkarhi wunwana ya tala, swa tsundzukiwa leswaku u xava tikithi masiku ma nga ri mangani."" which translates to: ""Since buses entering the region are sometimes crowded, it is recommended that you buy tickets a few days in advance.""
*   **A: Tibazi ti suka hi 8:30 ntsena (Buses only leave at 8:30)** - The passage states buses leave throughout the day, especially between 6:30 and 7:30 heading east.
*   **C: Tibazi to tala ta suka siku hinkwaro (Many buses leave all day)** - While buses run throughout the day, the passage highlights that buses to the east leave mostly between 6:30 and 7:30.
*   **D: Ku hakelela thekisi yin’we ku nga ha va ndlela leyinene yo famba (Hiring a taxi might be a good way to travel)** - Taxis are mentioned as a faster and more comfortable option for shorter distances, like Paro or Punakha. This is not relevant for a trip to the east."
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki nhlamuselo leyi kongomeke ya Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **C: A yi fikeleleki hi xihahampfhuka**.

The passage states that Timbuktu ""yi na rivala ra swihaha mpfuka"" which means it *is* accessible by airplane. Therefore, option C is the statement that is *not* an accurate description of Timbuktu according to the passage.
"
Eka timhaka leti landzelaka hi yihi leyi nga ntiyiso hi Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **A: Doroba leri ra fikelelaka hi xihahampfhuka**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""...naswona yi na rivala ra swihaha mpfuka."" (and it has an airport).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ri xongile ematshan’weni yo va evuswetini** - The passage states: ""...Timbuktu i doroba leri siwaneke..."" (Timbuktu is a poor city).
*   **C: Yi hava swilo swa le Afrika ku hambana ni madoroba ya le kusuhi** - The passage states: ""...Doroba leri ri hererile ku akiwa ku hambana na ma doroba man’wana wa tiko, hikuva ri na vu Arabiya ngopfu ku ri na vu Afrika."" (This city is built differently from other cities in the country, because it has more Arab than African influence). This *implies* it has African influences, just less than other cities.
*   **D: Doroba leri a ra ha koki vapfhumba** - The passage states: ""...hambileswi ndhumba ya rona yi ri endla ndhawu ya vapfhumba..."" (although its beauty makes it a tourist destination). This indicates that it still attracts tourists."
Xana Tiolimpiki ta ximumu xi sungule ku hleriwa rini? ,"The correct answer is **D: July 2020**.

The passage states ""eku heleni ka March milawu yo tala yo khansela hikwalaho ka ntungu wa khorona a yi nga pfumeli leswaku munhu a buka ku hi **July 2020** ku nga nkarhi lowu Tiolimpiki a ti hundziseriwe kona."" This means the Olympics were postponed to July 2020 due to the pandemic.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana moya lowukulu wu hundzuka rini xihuhuri?","The correct answer is **D: Loko wu khumba ehansi**.

The passage states: ""Loko swi sungula swi sungula tanihi tifanele leti ehlaka emapapeni, naswona ku va “xihuhuri” loko xi khumba misava."" This directly translates to: ""When they start they start as funnels hanging from the clouds, and only become a ""tornado"" when they touch the ground.""
"
Eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi fambisanaka ni xihuhuri?,"The correct answers are:

*   **A: Swihuhuri swi tshamela ku pfuxa mimoya rivilo ra 100-200 wa timayile hi awara** (This is directly stated in the passage)
*   **B: Swi tala ku tlakula swilo swo tika** (This is also directly stated in the passage)
*   **C: Swi va ni xiyimo xa xihuhuri loko swi khumba misava** (This is also directly stated in the passage)

Option D is incorrect, because the passage indicates that tornadoes *draw* air in, rather than push it out."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana mupfhumba a nga xi kuma kwihi xitsundzuxo malunghana ni xiyimo xa politiki xa doroba leri a ri endzelaka?","The correct answer is **D: Eka hulumendhe ya yena** (To their own government).

Here's why:

*   The passage warns that travel advisories are specific to the issuing country's citizens and might not accurately reflect the situation for others. It suggests that while seeking foreign advisories can be helpful, travelers should primarily rely on sources within their own country.
"
"Loko switsundzuxo swa maendzo, xana hi swihi leswi muaki wa tiko rimbe a nga tshukaka a nga langutani na swona?","The correct answer is **C: Ndzindzakhombo wa rihanyo lowu khumbekaka**.

The passage states: ""Loko ko humesiwa xilemukiso mayelana ni tiko leri u lavaka ku ri endzela, swi nga endleka ndzindzakhombo wa wena wa swa rihanyo kumbe lowu ku pfunaka loko u lava ku khansela riendzo wu nga tirhi."" This directly implies that health insurance might not be valid if a travel advisory is in place. Therefore, that's a potential issue a traveler from another country might face.

Option A (Ndzindzakhombo wo pfuna ku khansela riendzo lowu khumbekaka): While mentioned, it's tied to the health insurance issue. The primary concern being highlighted is health coverage, not just cancellation insurance.

Option B (Ku katsakanyiwa swinene ka xiyimo xa politiki xa tiko ro karhi): While the passage mentions simplification of political situations, it does not suggest that this simplification is only a concern for the foreign national.

Option D (Vuxokoxoko malunghana ni xiyimo xa politiki xa tiko ro karhi): This is the opposite of the point being made, which states that the information is an oversimplification.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i muxaka muni wa riendzo lowu nga tshukaka wu nga lavi ngopfu mpfuno wa ku buma eka muhleri wa maendzo?","The correct answer is **A: Riendzo ra nhlengeletano wa ntirho edorobeni leri muendzi a tshameke a ri endzela**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage focuses on the value of travel agents for unfamiliar or complex travel situations.** Option A describes a familiar trip, which would likely not require the expertise of a travel agent.
*   **Options B, C, and D all involve elements where a travel agent's expertise would be particularly valuable.** These elements include:
    *   Specific budget constraints
    *   Language barriers
    *   First-time travel to unfamiliar locations

Therefore, Option A is the type of travel least likely to need the assistance of a travel agent."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xiyimo laha muendzi a nga vuyeriwaka swinene eka muhleri wa maendzo?","Based on the passage, the best answer is **B: Loko muendzi a tsakela ku buka vuvalangi byo hlawuleka ro sungula** (When a tourist is interested in booking a specific, first-time tour).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that travel agents are helpful when visiting places with different cultures, languages, or economic conditions. A ""specific first-time tour"" implies a specialized experience, potentially involving unfamiliar aspects where a travel agent's expertise would be beneficial. The passage says that it would be better to use an agent who is accustomed to booking the type of travel you want to do.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Loko muendzi a buka swihahampfhuka swa ku ya ni ku vuya edorobeni ra ka vona** (When a tourist books round-trip flights to their hometown): This is the simplest type of travel and likely doesn't require a travel agent's specialized knowledge.
*   **C: Loko muendzi a ri kota kahle ririmi leri vulavuriwaka laha a yaka kona** (When a tourist is fluent in the language spoken at their destination): If the tourist is fluent in the language of the place, they would likely not need help from a travel agent.
*   **D: Loko muendzi a endzela ndhawu laha a toloveleke mindhavuko ya kona** (When a tourist visits a place where they are familiar with the cultures): If the tourist is already familiar with the cultures, they would likely not need help from a travel agent."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga pfunaka muendzi ku papalata ku khomiwa hi tingana loko a endzela tindhawu letintshwa?","The correct answer is **B: Ku tiyimisela ku ringeta swakudya leswi nga tolovelekangiki**.

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes the importance of understanding that things will be *different* from home. Therefore, expecting things to be the same (A & C) goes against the passage's advice.
*   While researching accommodations (D) might be helpful, it's not the core point about adapting to cultural differences.
*   Trying unfamiliar foods (B) directly addresses a point mentioned in the passage (swakudya) and demonstrates an open-mindedness that helps avoid disappointment or discomfort with local customs.

Therefore, the best answer is **B**."
"Hi ku landza rungula leri nga eka xiyenge lexi, i munhu wa muxaka muni loyi a nga ha khomiwaka hi tingana loko a endzela tiko rimbe?","The correct answer is **C: Munhu loyi a pfumalaka mianakanyo yo pfuleka (A person who lacks an open mind)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes that things will be different when you travel and that you shouldn't expect them to be like home.
*   A person who is not open-minded is less likely to accept and adapt to these differences. They would be more prone to being surprised or dissatisfied with the unfamiliar aspects of a new place.
*   The other options describe people who would likely enjoy or be less bothered by the differences encountered while traveling."
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki xitsundzuxo lexi bumabumeriwaka eka vaendzi lava sungula ku endzela tiko leri ra ha hluvukaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku rhanga hi ku tiva swimila swa ndhawu u nga si endlela ehansi.**

Here's why:

*   The paragraph advises against immediately immersing oneself in the ""local life"" upon arrival. It suggests easing into the culture by staying in upscale hotels and eating familiar foods. This contradicts the idea of immediately exploring and identifying local plants before settling down.

The other options are consistent with the advice given:

*   B: is implied, not explicitly in the given text.
*   C: is directly stated as something to do if you *must* sleep outdoors.
*   D: is directly advised.

Therefore, option A is the only one that goes against the recommended approach for first-time visitors in a developing country, according to the provided text."
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga boxiwiki tanihi nchumu wo wu dya ngopfu loko wa ha titoloveta tiko leri ra ha hluvukaka?,"The correct answer is **C: Matirasi kumbe xiponci loko u dzima tende**.

The passage advises against sleeping directly on the ground without protection from animals, but it doesn't say that a mattress or sleeping bag should be avoided for eating. The other options are mentioned as things to adjust to slowly:

*   **A: Swakudya swa muxaka wa Xilungu** - The passage suggests eating familiar foods at first.
*   **B: Vukorhokeri bya xiyimo** - The passage suggests staying at high-class hotels.
*   **D: Tihotela ta xiyimo** - The passage suggests staying at high-class hotels.

"Eka mihlawulo leyi landzelaka hi swihi leswi nga swinene eka loyi a nga ni pholisi loyi a lavaka ku kuma kopi ya pholisi yo yi hlayisa eka online, kambe a ri hava inthanete?","The correct answer is **C: Ku hlayisa kopi eka laptop**.

Here's why:

*   **P says**: ""Loko u famba ni Laptop kumbe tablet seyivha kopi ya wena eka swona kumbe u va na disk (u ta kota ku yi kuma hambi u nga ri na inthanete).""
*   The question specifically asks for a solution that works *without* internet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku nyika kopi eka munghana loyi u fambaka na yena:** While the text suggests giving a copy to someone else, it doesn't help the policyholder access the information themselves.
*   **B: Ku tirhumelela kopi hi imeyili:** Requires internet access to send and receive.
*   **D: Ku hlayisa kopi eka “cloud”:** Requires internet access to access."

"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi wihi mpimo wa negative lowu kombisa muxaka wa filimi lowu tirhisaka ngopfu?","The correct answer is **D: 36 x 24 mm negative**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Filimi leyi tolovelekeke ya 35 mm (36 x 24 mm negative) hi yona leyi tolovelekeke."" This directly translates to ""The common 35 mm film (36 x 24 mm negative) is the most common.""
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi wihi muxaka wa filimi lowu nga ni resolution leyi fanaka na DSLR?,"The answer is **A: Filimi ya 35 mm**.

The passage states: ""Filimi leyi tolovelekeke ya 35 mm (36 x 24 mm negative) hi yona leyi tolovelekeke. Hi ntolovelo yi nga tatisiwa hi ku olova loko yi ku helerile naswona yi ni resolution leyi ringanakanyana ni leya sweswi ya DSLR.""
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi hi rihi goza ro hetelela eku sunguleni bindzu ro tsala hi swa vufambi?","The correct answer is **C: Ku tiendlela webusayiti ya wena (To create your own website)**.

The passage states that *after* you've mastered writing and editing on an existing travel blog website, *then* you can create your own website. This makes creating your own website the final step mentioned in the passage.
"
"Loko u sungula bindzu ro tsala hi swa vufambi, eka vuswikoti lebyi landzelaka hi byihi lebyi faneleke ku rhanga byi lotiwa?","The correct answer is **A: Ku buloga**.

The passage states that the first step is to improve your skills on an existing travel blog website. ""Ku buloga"" translates to ""blogging,"" which aligns with this first step. While editing and website creation are mentioned, they come *after* improving your blogging skills on an existing platform.
"
Xana swiphiqo swa le ndzeni ka khwiri swi toloveleke eka maxelo ya njhani?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: Maxelo yo hisa**.

The passage states that ""hi ximumu ni swiphiqo swa le ndzeni swi tinyika matimba,"" meaning that internal problems are strengthened during summer (the hot season).
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana u nga sawutiseka hi ku tshamela ku langutana ni xiyimo xihi?","The correct answer is **B: Switsongwatsongwana swa ndhawu**.

The passage states that being exposed to germs in your home can lead to immunity. This implies you build immunity to the **local germs (switsongwatsongwana swa ndhawu)**. The other options aren't directly linked to developing immunity from household exposure according to the text.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi pfunaka loko u famba endhawini ya Schengen?,"The correct answer is **A, B, and C**.  All three are mentioned as benefits of the Schengen area in the given text. Option D is incorrect, as a passport is still required, just not for every border crossing within the Schengen zone.
"
I yini lexi nga ha kumekiki esirheni ra Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **D: Rifuwo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the artifacts from the tomb (including treasure) have been removed to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. So, while the tomb itself exists, the ""rifuwo"" (treasure) is no longer *in* the tomb.
*   The passage confirms you can see the head and shoulders of the mummy.
*   While the tomb is not elaborately decorated, the question asks what is no longer *in* the tomb, not what was never there."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi yihi ndhawu ya Vancouver leyi nga tshukaka yi nga tsakeriwi hi vaendzi lava xiyisisaka mitsengo? ","The correct answer is **D: Whistler**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Whistler is ""expensive to visit"" due to the Olympics.
*   It mentions Bowen Island as a place people visit for day trips and weekends.
*   Granville Island is mentioned as the location where you can take a taxi to Bowen Island.

Therefore, Whistler is the location which might not be attractive to price-conscious tourists."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi yihi ndhawu leyi nga tshukaka yi nyika ngopfu vaendzi ntokoto wa xiviri wa le Vancouver?","The correct answer is **A: Bowen Island**.

The passage highlights Bowen Island as a popular destination for day trips and weekend getaways, offering activities like kayaking, hiking, and restaurants. This suggests it provides a genuine Vancouver experience. While Whistler is mentioned, it's noted as being expensive. The passage mentions Granville Island and Downtown Vancouver in relation to how to get to Bowen Island, but does not suggest they are the best experience for tourists.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi rini laha vaendzi va faneleke ku endzela mahovohovo loko va lava ku vona khwatsi?","The correct answer is **D: Ehandle ka nguva ya mpfula**.

The passage states that during the rainy season (November to March), the water levels are so high that it's difficult to see the falls properly. Therefore, the best time to visit is outside of the rainy season.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi swihi leswi nga swinene hi ku endzela Victoria Falls exikarhi ka November na March?","The correct answer is **C: Ku vona vuxongi lebyi hlamarisaka bya ti-Fall**.

The passage states: ""Hi nguva ya mpfula (November kuya eka March), mpimo wa mati wu va wu ye ehenhla naswona mahovohovo ma ta wisa mati hi ndlela yo tsakisa."" This translates to: ""During the rainy season (November to March), the water level is high and the falls will cascade water in a spectacular way."" This indicates that the falls are especially beautiful during this time.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi nga bumabumeriwiki loko u tirhisa drone?","The correct answer is **D: Ku teka filimi etindhawini leti teleke ntsena laha drone a yi voniwiki.**

Here's why:

*   The text specifically mentions that flying a drone near an airport or over a crowd is frowned upon, even if legally permitted. Filming in crowded areas where the drone is visible directly contradicts this advice.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: Ku kamba ka ha ri emahlweni leswi u pfumeleriweke ku teka filimi ya swona** - The text explicitly advises checking what you're allowed to film.
*   **B: Ku kuma layisense leyi engetelekeke** - The text mentions checking for necessary permits/licenses, implying it's something to consider.
*   **C: Ku lavisisa hi mapapila ya mpfumelelo** - The text mentions checking for necessary permits/licenses, implying it's something to consider."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi tihi tindhawu letinene to teka filimi hi ku tirhisa drone?","The correct answer is **D: Eka tindhawu laha u kumeke mimpfumelelo ka ha ri emahlweni.**

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes the importance of checking regulations and obtaining permits *before* filming with a drone. It explicitly states ""languta ka ha ri nkarhi leswaku i yini leswi u pfumeleriweke ku swifilima naswona ku laveka mpfumelelo kumbe layisense ya njhani."" This means that flying in areas where you've secured the necessary permissions is a good place to start.

Let's examine why the other options are wrong:

*   **A: Ekusuhi ni mintshungu leyi nga taka yi nga karhatiwi hi vukona bya drone:** The passage states that ""Ku hahisa drone kusuhi na...eka ntshungu ku tshama ku vonelo ro biha"". So this is not a good place to take a video using a drone.
*   **B: Eka tindhawu laha ku teka swifaniso ku nga amukeriwiki:** The passage states that ""Loko ku tekiwa ka swinepe swi nga pfumeleriwi,sweswo swi vula leswaku u nga ehleketi ni ku ehleketa hi ku teka vhidiyo eka ndhawu yo leyo"". So this is not a good place to take a video using a drone.
*   **C: Eka tindhawu ta mphesamphesa laha drone yi nga vonakiki kahle:** This option doesn't address the legality or safety concerns highlighted in the passage. Hiding the drone doesn't make its use appropriate or legal."
"Hi ku landza xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xivulwa lexi nga riki ntiyiso malunghana ni xilaveko xo tsarisa eka endlelo ra vhisa?","The correct answer is **B: Matiko hinkwawo ma lava ku tsarisa ni valawuri va ndhawu.**

The passage states: ""Ematikweni man’wana, u fanele u tsarisa leswaku u kona ni adirese ya laha u tshamaka kona eka valawuri va kwalaho."" This clearly indicates that registration is *not* required in all countries.
"
Eka leti landzelaka hi yihi ndhawu leyi muendzi a nga taka a nga yi eka yona ku ya tsarisa?,"The correct answer is **D: Tihofisi ta vapfhumba**.

The text mentions:

*   Police station
*   Hotels
*   Tourist offices

Option A, B and D are all mentioned. The question is asking about an instance that might not occur, the text does not say all hotels do the registration process.

Therefore, the best answer is **D: Tihofisi ta vapfhumba**.
"
I mani loyi a nga taka a nga vuyeriwi hi ku tinyikela hi ku tirhandzela loko a ri karhi a famba?,"The correct answer is **B: Munhu loyi a lavaka muholo wo nyawula (Someone who wants a high salary)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""...mintirho yo tala yo tirhandzela hi va na byetlelo naswona a hi yingani leyi nyikaka muholo nyana wutsongo (most volunteer jobs provide accommodation and very few provide a small salary)."" This implies that volunteer work generally doesn't offer significant financial compensation. Therefore, someone seeking a high salary wouldn't benefit from it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Munhu loyi a nga ni ntshembo wo kuma vanghana lavantshwa loko a ri entsungeni (Someone who hopes to make new friends when they are abroad):** The passage mentions meeting other people as a benefit of volunteering.
*   **C: Munhu loyi a nga ni ntshembo wo kuma vuswikoti lebyintshwa (Someone who hopes to gain new skills):** The passage explicitly mentions gaining new skills as a benefit.
*   **D: Munhu loyi a nga tsakelaka ku ku tirha ivi a hakeriwa hi ku nyikiwa byetlelo (Someone who is willing to work and be paid with accomodation):** The passage clearly states that most volunteer jobs provide accommodation and very few provide a small salary."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana ku tinyikela hi ku tirhandzela loko a ri entsungeni swi nga n’wi vuyerisa njhani muendzi loyi a landzelaka bajete?","The correct answer is **C: Ku pfa ku nyikeriwa ntirho wo hakeriwa hi ku nyikiwa byetlelo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""mintirho yo tala yo tirhandzela hi va na byetlelo naswona a hi yingani leyi nyikaka muholo nyana wutsongo,"" and ""Swi nga va mhaka ya kahle loko u anamisa bajeti ya wena leswaku u tshama nkarhi wo leha hikuva mintirho yo tala yo tirhandzela hi va na byetlelo naswona a hi yingani leyi nyikaka muholo nyana wutsongo.""

Therefore, the primary benefit mentioned for someone on a budget is that many volunteer positions provide accommodation (byetlelo), which would reduce the cost of travel."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga langutiwaka tanihi xitsundzuxo lexi tolovelekeke ku ya le Walt Disney World?","The correct answer is **C: Ku heta riendzo hinkwaro eka muako wa le Disney**.

The passage states ""...heta kwalomu ka vhiki u nga si huma eka miako ya Disney..."" which directly translates to spending the entire trip within the Disney complex. Options A and D are elements of the typical trip but not the *entirety* of it. Option B is incorrect because it states ""hoteleni ya le tlhelo,"" meaning a hotel that is not Disney-owned, whereas the passage explicitly states that the visitors stay in Disney hotels."
Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki ntiyiso hi Walt Disney World?,"Nhlawulo lowunene hi:

**A: Mathikithi yo tirhisiwa katsongo ephakini ma nga hundziseriwa eka vaendzi van’wana**

Leswi swi hambanile na leswi vuriweke eka ndzimana ya P. Ndzimana yi vula hi ku kongoma leswaku mathikithi a ya hundziseriwi. Swilondza swin’wana hinkwaswo swi ntiyiso hi Walt Disney World hi ku ya hi ndzimana."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka timhaka leti landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga tshukaka xi nga hlanganisiwi eka khoso yo letela kumbe eka tibuku?","The correct answer is **D: Ku tlanga hi ku ku encenyeta (Playing practical jokes)**.

Here's why:

*   **P states:** The text focuses on preparation for hostile environments, specifically war zones. The training involves first aid, possibly weapons training, and understanding the dynamics of conflict areas. Survival in hostile environments is mentioned.
*   **Ku hanya emananga (A: Desert survival):** While mentioned as a topic with abundant books, it is still a survival skill related to the ability to survive harsh conditions, and survival skills might be useful in a hostile environment.
*   **Ku lulamela mpfuno wa xilamulela mhangu (B: First aid preparedness):** Explicitly mentioned as part of the training.
*   **Ku lulamela ndhawu ya nyimpi (C: War zone preparedness):** The main focus of the training and the text as a whole.
*   **Ku tlanga hi ku ku encenyeta (D: Playing practical jokes):** This is irrelevant to survival skills or staying safe in a dangerous environment."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka timhaka leti landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga tshukaka xi hlanganisiwa eka khoso yo letela?","The correct answer is **A: Mpfuno wa xilamulela mhangu**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Khoso ya kona yi teka 2 ku ya eka 5 wa masiku laha na wena u nga ta katseka eka vuleteri bya xilamulela mhangu..."".
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi yihi ndlela leyinene yo papalata mati lama kumbexana ma thyakeke?","The passage mentions two ways to avoid potentially unsafe water:

*   Boiling water (for different durations depending on the situation)
*   Buying bottled water from a reputable company.

Option B, ""Ku xava mati ya mabodlhele"" (Buying bottled water) is therefore the most accurate answer based on the text. While A is correct, B is a safer option.
Option B is the best response.
Final Answer: (B)"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga tshukaka xi tika hambi kuri eka vahlamberi lava nga ni vuswikoti?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: Ku hlambela emagandlatini (Swimming in rip currents)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that rip currents can cause fatigue and difficulty returning to shore, even for experienced swimmers. The text details the dangers and how they can drown even skilled swimmers.
The other options are not relevant to the text."
Xana u fanele ku endla yini loko u kokiwa hi magandlati lama hobomulanaka?,"Based on the passage (P), the correct answer is **A: Ringeta ku huma eka magandlati ya matimba hi ku ya eka tlhelo rin’wana, ivi u hlambela u ya eribuweni hi ntolovelo.**

The passage advises to get to safety, and if you cannot, seek help. So, the best strategy is to swim out of the rip current to the side.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi le ka ndhawu yihi laha ku endzela xihondzo ku nga vaka nkarhi wo wisa lowu phyuphyisaka?","The correct answer is **C: Minkova ya le Rhine**.

The passage specifically mentions visiting ""xihondzo xa le Loire Valley, minkova ya le Rhine kumbe ku famba hi swikepe u ya eka tindhawu leti tsakisaka ta le Danube kumbe Erie Canal.""  Therefore, the Rhine Valley is listed as a place to visit.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki xitsundzuxo lexinene eka vavasati lava endzelaka ndhawu leyi?","The correct answer is **C: Ku papalata ku ambala rhingi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly advises women to wear a ring (even if they're not married) and recommends it *not* look expensive. Avoiding wearing a ring goes directly against the provided advice.
*   The other options are supported by the passage:
    *   A: The suggestion that a woman should pretend to be married implies that speaking about being single could be a bad idea.
    *   B: The passage mentions that cultural differences can lead to misinterpretations.
    *   D: The passage advises women to be firm when refusing men."
"Hi ku landza ndhawu leyi hlamuseriwaka eka xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xitsundzuxo lexi nga pfunaka vavasati lava nga vaendzi?","The correct answer is **B: Ku ambala rhingi leyikulu ku kombisa ku va u nghenele vukati**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Swa pfuna ku tlhela u ambala rhingi (a yi fanelanga yi vonaka yi durha ngopfu. Vavasati: Ku ringanyetiwa leswaku vafambi hinkwavo lava nga vavasati va vula leswaku va tekiwile, kunga khathariseki xiyimo xa vukati."" (It is useful to wear a ring (it does not need to look expensive. All female travellers are encouraged to say that they are married, regardless of marital status).

The other options are incorrect:

*   A: The passage explicitly mentions that being followed, grabbed by the hand, etc., is common.
*   C: It is not being advised to avoid being conservative.
*   D: The passage suggests to be firm and don't be afraid to stand your ground when saying no to a man."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xiyimo lexi nga tshukaka xi lava muteki wa swifaniso swa swiharhi a tirhisa khamera ya tilense yo karhi?","The correct answer is **A: Loko a teka swifaniso swa swivumbiwa leswitsongo ngopfu**.

The passage states: ""Swi lava ku tirhisa khamera ya tilense to leha hambileswi swilo swo fana ni swinyenyana kumbe swiharhi leswitsongo swi lavaka tilense tin'wana."" This directly indicates that small animals require different lenses than the commonly used telephoto lenses.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga boxiwiki eka xiyenge lexi tanihi leswi tikaka eka vateki va swifaniso swa swiharhi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku kuma tilense leti lavekaka**.

While the passage mentions the *use* of specific lenses (long lenses for many animals, different lenses for birds and small animals), it doesn't explicitly state that *obtaining* these lenses is a difficulty for wildlife photographers. The other options are directly mentioned as challenges:

*   **A: Ku kuma swiharhi leswi nga riki swa tiko rero** (Finding non-native animals) - Directly mentioned in the text.
*   **B: Ku langutana ni swiharhi swo kariha** (Dealing with angry animals) - Directly mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Ku tirha eka mbango wo tika swinene** (Working in difficult environments) - Discussed in terms of extreme weather conditions.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga tshukaka xi vanga swiphiqo leswi nga nyawuriki eka muchayeri loyi a fambaka etintshaveni?,"The passage mentions several problems that snow, ice, and cold weather can cause for drivers, specifically:

*   Lower traction
*   Snow or ice making vehicles unable to move
*   Reduced visibility

Looking at the answer options:

*   **A: Ku tala ka mimovha (High traffic)** - Not mentioned in the passage as being specifically tied to snow/ice/mountains.
*   **B: Ku khuhlana ku le hansi (Lower traction)** - Directly mentioned as a problem with ice and snow.
*   **C: Nkahelo lowukulu (High altitude)** - Although driving in the mountains will have this factor, the passage does not directly state this.
*   **D: Ku tikeriwa ku vona kahle (Reduced visibility)** - Directly mentioned as a problem caused by snow.

While both B and D are plausible, the question asks about problems that are *significant*. The passage says even a small amount of snow can quickly render a car unable to move; in this scenario, B: low traction would be a significantly greater problem than D: reduced visibility. So, to avoid accidents and stay on the road, you must have proper traction.

Therefore, the best answer is **B: Ku khuhlana ku le hansi (Lower traction)**."
I yini lexi nga tshukaka xi fana hi ta xibalo xa muholo eka matiko yo hambanahambana?,"The correct answer is **D: Swiyenge swa xibalo (Tax brackets)**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ti rheyiti na tlawa wa xibalo swi hambanile ku suka eka tiko kuya eka rin’wana."" This implies that while the *rates* and *specific brackets* vary, the concept of using *brackets* to determine the tax owed is a common element across different countries.
* **Option A: Tirheyiti (Rates)**: The passage explicitly states rates *differ*.
* **Option B: Ku hleriwa (Calculation)**: Tax calculations can vary significantly.
* **Option C: Laha u vikaka kona xibalo (Where you report the tax)**: Reporting procedures are highly specific to each country.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, loko u tirha entsungeni kambe u tshama kun’wana, u nga ha tshuka u rhumela kwihi xibalo xa muholo?","The correct answer is **C: Eka tiko leri u tirhaka eka rona sweswi**.

The passage states ""ku tirha e tikweni rimbe swi vula leswaku u fanele u hakela xibalo xa muholo eka tiko leri u nga eka rona."" (working in a foreign country means you must pay income tax to that country).  The question asks where you pay income tax if you work in one place but live elsewhere.  Therefore, you pay tax in the country where you are working.
"
Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga hlamuseliki hi ku kongoma World’s Fair?,"The correct answer is **C: Swiendlakalo swa kona swi nga teka ku fika eka tin’hweti ta ntsevu**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Minkombiso yi nga ha kombisa matimu kumbe ndhavuko wa tiko** - This is directly stated in the first paragraph ""Matiko lama hlanganyelaka ma lunghiselela minkombiso ya vutshila ni ya dyondzo eka timbala ta mintlangu ta tiko leswaku ma kombisa swiphiqo swa misava kumbe ndhavuko ni matimu ya matiko ya vona.""
*   **B: Minkombiso ya timbala yi kombisiwa swin’we ni ya vutshila ni ya dyondzo** - This is implied in the first paragraph, mentioning that countries prepare exhibits of art and education in national pavilions.
*   **C: Swiendlakalo swa kona swi nga teka ku fika eka tin’hweti ta ntsevu** - The text refers to International Horticultural Expositions, not World’s Fair. Therefore it does not directly describe it.
*   **D: Matiko a ma boheki ku hoxa xandla** - While not explicitly stated, the text implies that participation is voluntary.

Therefore, option C is the only statement that does not directly describe the World’s Fair as defined in the first paragraph."
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nawu wa World’s Fair kumbe International Exposition?,"Let's analyze each option based on the provided text:

*   **A: Minkombiso yi fanele ku kombisa matimu ni swiphiqo swa misava:** The first sentence of the text mentions that participating countries prepare artistic and educational exhibits to showcase global issues or their country's culture and history. So this statement is consistent with the text.

*   **B: Tiko rin’we ri nga ka ri nga rhurheli minkombiso lembe ni lembe:** The text states that International Horticultural Expositions ""can legally be held every year (as they are in various countries), but in reality they are not."" This implies that legally, it's *possible* to hold them every year, although not always done. The question asks about the law, and the law allows for this to happen every year.

*   **C: Minkombiso yi fanele ku teka tin’hweti to fika eka ntsevu:** The text states that these events ""typically last between three and six months."" This statement is consistent with the text.

*   **D: Leswaku nkhuvo lowu wu va kona, matiko hinkwawo ma fanele ku hoxa xandla:** The text doesn't say that *all* countries must participate. It only mentions that participating countries prepare exhibits.

Both A and C are correct, however, since the question is about the World Fair or International Exposition in general, instead of International Horticultural Expositions specifically, the correct answer is A.

**Therefore, the correct answer is A.**"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi ku xi endla swi nga sivelaka ku hlaseriwa hi xiharhi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku basisa ekhempeni (Keeping the campsite clean)**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""tivonele eka risema leri vitanaka tibere ni swiharhi swin’wana, kutani papalata ku khoma kumbe ku sweka swakudya leswi nga ni risema u tlhela u basisa ekhempeni ya wena."" (Beware of smells that attract bears and other animals, and avoid handling or cooking food with strong smells, and keep your campsite clean). Therefore, a clean campsite helps prevent attracting animals and thus avoids attacks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku tamela mintsembyana ya risuna (Handling perfumed lotions):** The passage recommends against this as strong smells attract bears.
*   **C: Ku va ekule hi mpfhuka wa 25 wa timitara eka timhisi (Being 25 meters away from hyenas):** The passage states staying 100 meters away from bears and hyenas. Also, staying away does not prevent attack.
*   **D: Ku hlongola swiharhi swi swiphemu swa swakudya (Chasing animals with food scraps):** This would agitate the animal and likely increase the risk of attack.

Therefore, keeping the campsite clean is the preventative measure mentioned."
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga boxiwiki eka xiyenge lexi tanihi lexi nga vangelaka ku hlaseriwa hi swiharhi?,"The correct answer is **D: Swiharhi leswi nga tolovelangiki vanhu**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Risema lerikulu** - The passage mentions to be careful of the scent that bears and other animals are attracted to.
*   **B: Ku tsandzeka ku va ekule na swona** - The passage clearly states the importance of maintaining a safe distance from animals.
*   **C: Ku nyika swiharhi swakudya** - The passage explicitly warns against feeding animals.
*   **D: Swiharhi leswi nga tolovelangiki vanhu** - The passage starts by stating that even though the animals there are accustomed to seeing people, it is important to be cautious. Therefore, it is implied that the passage does not point to animals not being accustomed to seeing people as a factor for animal attacks."
