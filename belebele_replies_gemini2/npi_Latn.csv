"anuchhed anusar, kun MySpace suvidhaley padhna samasya vayeka vidyarthiharulai faidajanak huna sakchha?","The passage mentions several benefits of MySpace, particularly for students struggling with reading. Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: Anukulan (Customization):** The passage states that MySpace can be easily customized with different colors to make it easier to read.
*   **B: Blogharu (Blogs):** While blogs are a feature of MySpace, the passage doesn't directly link them to helping students with reading difficulties.
*   **C: Ek web thegana (A web address):** The passage states that pages can be accessed easily by providing a simple web address, benefiting students who have difficulty remembering and typing complex addresses.
*   **D: 54 million profileharu (54 million profiles):** The number of profiles on MySpace doesn't directly relate to benefits for students with reading problems.

The passage says: ""Yasalai padhna sajilo garauna ra chaheanusarko dherai wa come rangle anukulan garna sakinchha."" Meaning ""It can be easily customized with many or few colors as desired to make it easier to read.""

Therefore, **A: Anukulan (Customization)** is the most directly related to helping students with reading difficulties, as the passage highlights the ability to customize colors to improve readability.

The correct answer is **A**."
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun khruschchebhle majdur ko dangako pratikriyako bhaag hoina?","Correct answer is **C: jyala katauti ma bridhi** (increasing wage cuts).

Here's why:

The paragraph states that the workers were protesting *against* wage cuts. Khrushchev responded by making some economic concessions and reinstating order with tanks. The question asks for something Khrushchev *didn't* do in response to the strike. Therefore, increasing wage cuts (which would be the opposite of addressing the workers' concerns) is the correct answer.
"
nimna madhey kun polandko dangako karan hoina?,"The correct answer is **D: Wladyslaw Gomulka's appointment**.

The passage states that food shortages and wage cuts were the reasons for the protests, which evolved into public opposition against communism. Gomulka's appointment was a *result* of the protests, not a cause.

"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kunley USSR ra sanyukta rajya america bichko sambandhalai asar garena?","Anuchhed anusar, USSR ra Sanyukta Rajya America bichko sambandhalai asar nagarne tatwa ho **B: Germany ko bare vichar**.

Tyasaile, sahi uttar **B: germany ko bare vichar** ho.

*   A: ragat babhaw lai dhilo banauna

**A: ragat babhaw lai dhilo banauna**"
giza patharma ke pauna sakinchha?,"Paragraph anusar, Giza patharma chihanharu, mandirharu, ra great pyramid sabai pauna sakinchha.

A: chihanharu - sahi ho
B: mandirharu - sahi ho
C: sabai saat ashcharya - galat ho (great pyramid euta matra aba ubhiraheko ashcharya ho)
D: great pyramid - sahi ho

Since multiple options are correct, the best answer is implied to be the one that encompasses all the individual correct answers.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is one that acknowledges all three items (chihan, mandir, great pyramid) are found at Giza. The provided options do not explicitly offer an encompassing answer, so we must choose from what is available. Since A, B, and D are all individually correct, the best answer is the one that is specifically mentioned as a primary structure within the passage.

**D: great pyramid**
"
great pyramidko uddeshya ke thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: pharaoh laai samman garnako lagi**.

The passage clearly states that the Great Pyramid was built to honor a deceased pharaoh."
mandir dhwasta banauney ago lagauney manisko pahichan huney gyanko jimmewar ko thiyo?,"Correct answer is C: Starbo.

The passage mentions that the Greek historian Strabo later mentioned the event, which is how we still know about it today. Therefore, Strabo is the one responsible for the knowledge of the arsonist's identity.
"
artemis mandirko punanirman sambandhiko kun kathan sahi ho?,"Prashna anusar sahi jawab ho: **B: tyo Raja alekjenderko shasanpachhi punanirman gariyeko thiyo**

Karan:

*   **A galat ho:** Raja Alexanderle punarnirman garnaka lagi tirne prastav gareka thiyye, tara unko prastav aswikrit bhayo.
*   **B sahi ho:** Lekhma spashta rupma ullekh chha ki Alexanderko mrityu bhayepachi, 323 BCE ma mandirko punarnirman gariyo.

"anuchhed anusar, prajatiharuley dui khuttama hideko sabaibhanda pahila kahiley thiyo?","Correct answer is **A: sattari laakh warsha agadi**

Here's why:

The passage states that *sahelenthropas* might have walked on two legs as early as seven million (sattari laakh) years ago. While *astrolopithecus* fossils show bipedalism dating back to 4.2-3.9 million years, the key phrase ""sabaibhanda pahila"" (earliest) makes A the correct answer.
"
yi madhey kun prajati niyamit dui khuttama hindthyo?,"Correct answer is **B: Thado Manis**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""manisharu homo erectus (thado manis) co udayasangai dui million warsha pahila thado bhaera hindna thaleka thee."" This means Homo erectus (Thado Manis) started walking upright around two million years ago.
*   The passage mentions that Astrolopithecus did not naturally walk upright.
*   Sahelenthropus might have walked on two feet but this is less clear."
WWII ko bela germanyko navyley ke prapta garna prayash gariraheko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: belayatlai manisharu ra samanharu prapta garnabata rokna.**

The passage explicitly states that the German navy (mainly using U-boats) was trying to stop the traffic of men and supplies being sent to Britain by the Americans across the Atlantic. Blocking Britain from receiving these resources was their objective.
"
"anuchhedma diyeko jaankari anusar, uttar atlantic abhiyanko samayma naval yuddhama kasle sabai bhanda dherai safalta payo?","Correct answer is **A: belayeti ra amerikiharu**

Explanation:
The passage states that the Allies (British and Americans) were trying to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic, while the Germans were trying to stop them. The passage also suggests that if the Allies had failed, Germany might have been able to conquer Britain. This implies that the Allies were ultimately successful in their efforts.
"
asarianharule ghodasawar fauj prayog ko suruwat garda ke ko astitwa thiyena?,"The passage states: ""tyo belasamma kathi awishkar bhaeko thiena, tyasaile assyrian ashwadle ghoda nango dhadma basera yuddha ladyo."" This translates to ""by that time the saddle had not been invented, therefore the Assyrian cavalry fought riding bareback.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: kathi** (saddle).
"
ghodasawar fauj prayog garney yuddhaharu kasari ladincha?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is:

*   **C: ghodasawar garera**

The passage specifically mentions that ""Ashwadal bhaneko ghoda chadhera yuddha gurney sena ho"" which translates to ""Ashwadal is an army that fights by riding horses"". This directly implies that horse cavalry warfare is conducted on horseback.

So, the answer is: **D: bhitri mandirma baliharu lyaudai gareko**
"

Paragraph ma spashta rupma lekhiyeko chha ki bhitri mandirma kewal pujariharu matra pasna paaunthe. Any pilihanharu (utsavharu, samharoharu ra ziggurat) manis ra pujari ubhayka lagi ho."
raja tutankhamunley kahiley kukhyaat bhaye?,"The correct answer is **C: unko chihan khoj pachi (after his tomb was discovered)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Yadyapi, 1922 co unko chihanko khojle unlai prasidha banayo (However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous).""
"
ek kuraley raja tutankhamunlai prakhyat egyptian raja banayo?,"The correct answer is **A: unko chihan lai kehi nagari chhodieko thiyo**.

The passage states: ""1922 co unko chihanko khojle unlai prasidha banayo. wigatka dherai chihanharu lutieka bella, yo chihanlai najanido rupma kehi nagari chhodieko thiyo."" This directly supports the idea that the untouched state of his tomb is what made him famous. The fact that it was left relatively undisturbed is what made the discovery so remarkable and led to his fame.

hibru pariwarley uniharuko dherai jasto samay kaha bitauthiye?,"The correct answer is **A: khula hawama**.

The passage states ""Hibru pariwarko adhikansh jeevan khula hawa bitthyo"" which translates to ""Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent in the open air.""
"
hibru pariwarma ke dherai mahatwapurna thiyena?,"Sahi uttara ho **A: uniharuko mausam**.

Pariwachhanale spashta rupma bhancha ki madhyapurvako nano mausam ghar tyati mahatwapurna thiena."
nimna madhey kelai scandinavian deshharu bichko bhinnata vanera varnan gariyeko chaina?,"Paragraph P clearly states that there were differences in:

*   itihas (history)
*   ritithiti (customs/traditions)
*   manisharu (people)

The passage doesn't mention any differences in *jamin* (land/geography) amongst the Scandinavian countries.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: jamin**
"
greenlandma pratham kasle basobas gare?,"The correct answer is **A: eskimo adiwasiharu**.

The passage states: ""Unko khojlai parwah nagari, tyas samayama eskimo adiwasiharu bhane pahilyai tyahan basiraheka thee."" which translates to ""Regardless of his discovery, at that time the Eskimo natives were already living there.""
"
kun samuhaley bina kursi khana mann paraaunthe?,"The passage states: ""jab garib manis ra mahilaharule kursima baser afno khana khanthe, dhani manisharu sangai bhoj garna mann paraaunthe jahaan tiniharule khana khaepachhi afno chheuma aaram garthe.""  This means poor people (both men and women) ate *sitting* on chairs.  Rich people preferred to *recline* together during meals.

Therefore, the group that preferred not to use chairs was the rich. The question asks which group preferred to eat without chairs, so the correct answer is **C: dhani roman purushharu** (rich Roman men). Although the passage doesn't specifically say ""men,"" it refers to ""dhani manisharu,"" which means ""rich people."" Since the context is about dining customs, and men were typically the dominant members of society, it's reasonable to assume ""dhani manisharu"" includes rich men.
"
nimna madhey ke purano roman bhojharuko bhag hunthena?,"The correct answer is **B: sankhyekiraharuko appetizer**.

Here's why:

*   **P states:** ""romanharule ... shankhekira... khanthe."" This directly supports option B.
*   **P states:** ""...romanharule jungli sungur, mayur, shankhekira ra dormaus bhanine ek kisimko rodentshit vichitra wa anautha jiwaharu khanthe.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: garib pahunaharu kursima basera khairaheko:** P states ""jab garib manis ra mahilaharule kursima baser afno khana khanthe, dhani manisharu sangai bhoj garna mann paraaunthe..."" This means poor people ate on chairs, but it doesn't necessarily mean they were *guests* at a feast.
*   **C: dhani purushharu ratko khanako samay paltiraheko:** P states ""dhani manisharu sangai bhoj garna mann paraaunthe jahaan tiniharule khana khaepachhi afno chheuma aaram garthe."" This means that wealthy people reclined *after* eating, not *during* the meal.
*   **D: roast gariyeko turkeyko thal:** P states ""kunai pani prachin romanle kahilyai turkey chakhena."" This directly contradicts option D."
"anuchhedko adharma, nimna madhye kun kurale dirgakalin prabhaav pardaina?","Sahee uttar **B: alpasankhyak sanskriti** ho.

**Explanation:**

*   **Anuchhedle ke bhandacha:** Alpasankhyak sanskritiharu prayah haraunchhan ra dherai dirghakalin prabhaav chhoddainan.

    *   **A: ek samaj:** Sabhyatako nirman ra vikasma samajko mahatwapurna bhumika hunchha.

Yeskaran, alpasankhyak sanskritile dirghakalin prabhaav napaarne kurako pratinidhitwa garcha."
"anuchhed anusar, rashtra bhanda pahile ke auncha?","Correct answer is **C: ek sahari-rajya**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Nagar-rajyaharu rashtraharuka agradutharu hun."" which translates to ""City-states are the predecessors of nations."" Therefore, city-states come before nations.

"
kun kathanley sahi tarikaley Drukgyal jongma vayeko agolagiko varnan gardacha?,"The correct answer is **A: baaki vayeko awashesh zhadbrung ngawang namgyalko tasvir thiyo**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Sun 1951 maa, agalagile drukgyal dongka kehi awasheshharu jastai jabdrang gawang namagyalko chhawi pratima matri baaki rahe."" This translates to ""In 1951, a fire left only some remnants of Drukgyal Dzong, such as the image statue of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: tibeti-mongol senaharu vijayi bhaekaa thiye:** The passage explicitly states the fortress was built to commemorate Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel's victory *against* the Tibetan-Mongol army.
* **C: tyo thauko prasiddhima kehi asar vayena:** The fire destroyed most of the fortress, it's highly unlikely this had no impact on its prominence. The latter part of the passage mentions how they worked to protect and preserve what remained of the fortress, suggesting they were concerned about its popularity.
* **D: tyo zhabdrung ngawang namgyeldwara surakshit gariyeko thiyo:** Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the fortress; he wasn't around to protect it from the fire in 1951.

"
douch east india companyley uniharu taiwanma vayeko samayma nimna madhey ke garenan?,"The correct answer is **D: taiwanko niyantran swaichya ching samrajyalai dieyo**.

The provided text states the following about the Dutch East India Company:

*   They established a base in southwestern Taiwan in 1624.
*   They changed indigenous grain production practices.
*   They employed Chinese laborers to work in their fields of rice and sugar cane.

The text does not state that the Dutch East India Company voluntarily ceded control of Taiwan to the Qing dynasty. Therefore, this is something they did not do during their time in Taiwan.
"
shimonoseki sandhiley ke sthapana garyo?,"The correct answer is **D: japanko taiwan mathiko adhikar** (Japan's authority over Taiwan).

The passage states ""...ching sarkarle simonoseki sandhi hastakshar garyo, jasanusar yasale taiwanko swamitwa japanlai sumpiyo..."" which directly translates to ""...the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which it handed over the ownership of Taiwan to Japan...""

Therefore, the Treaty of Shimonoseki established Japan's authority over Taiwan.

nimna madhye kun kathanley sinhaharuko samuha lai sahi tarikaley varnan gardaina?,"The passage states that:

*   Lions live in prides.
*   Prides contain several females and cubs, along with one to three related adult males.
*   Females are often closely related.
*   Lion prides behave similarly to hyena or wild dog packs.
*   They are dangerous to their prey.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Tiniharu kukurharuko jhund jastai vyavahar gardachan (They behave like packs of dogs).** The passage explicitly states that lion prides behave similarly to hyena or wild dog packs, so this statement **is** an accurate description.
*   **B: Purush ra mahilako anupat jod hudaina (The ratio of men to women is not even).** There are multiple females and cubs, and only one to three males. This indicates that there are more females than males. Therefore, the ratio of men to women is uneven. This statement **is** an accurate description.
*   **C: Mahila ra purushharu najikbata sambandhit hunchhan (Women and men are closely related).** The passage mentions that females are closely related to each other (sisters and daughters). The passage mentions the males are related to each other, but doesn't suggest any relationship between the males and the females. Therefore, this statement **is not** an accurate description.
*   **D: Tiniharu khatrnaak ra samajik dubai hunchhan (They are both dangerous and social).** The passage implies they are dangerous to their prey and also social as they live in groups. This statement **is** an accurate description.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C**.

‘koshanu’ shabdako utpattiko artha ke ho?,"The correct answer is **B: sano kotha**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Sell bhane shabd sela namak latin shabdabata aeko ho jasko earth sano kotha hunchha."" (The word 'cell' comes from the Latin word 'cella' which means small room.)
"
"anuchhed anuaar, praya: janawarharusanga ke garney khubi huncha?","The passage states: ""dherai janawarharu sarna sakchhan"" which translates to ""many animals can move"". This means halchal garne in Nepali or ""move"" in English.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: halchal garne**.
"

The passage states: ""Kewal janawarharuko dimag hunchha (tathapi sabai janawarharusanga dimag hundaina; udaharanka lagi jellyfish)."" This means that while animals generally have brains, not all animals do. The other options are characteristics that the passage implies are common to all animals.

The paragraph states that plants use sunlight to make their food through photosynthesis: ""Suryabata botabiruwaharule prakash sanshleshan garera uniharuko khana banaunchhan."" This directly answers the question about what helps plants in the photosynthesis process.
"

The passage states: ""Biruwaharule oxygen banaunchhan jun manawale shwas ferda linchha ra tiniharule carbon-dioxide linchhan june manawale fyankchhan (arthat, shwas fyankchhan).""  This clearly indicates that humans exhale carbon dioxide, which plants then take in.

nimna madhey kun kathanley prajatikaran prakriyalai sahi tarikaley varnan gardaina? ,"The correct answer is **A: yo naya janasankhya le samayojan garna nasakda huncha** (it can happen that the new population cannot adapt).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that speciation occurs as the new population *adapts* to its new environment.**  The entire mechanism hinges on the new group evolving different traits to thrive. If they *cannot* adapt, they will likely die out, not speciate. The passage says ""Samayaka sath, naya janasankhya uniharuko naya watawaranma anukul hoon lagda, tiniharu any janasankhyaka jasta thorai-thorai matra dekhin thalchhan."" which means ""Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, they begin to look less and less like the other population.""

Let's look at why the other options are correct statements based on the passage:

* **B: yo wikaskramko mahatwapurna pakshya ho** (it is an important aspect of evolution): The last sentence of the passage confirms this: ""prajatikaran ek apariharya parinam ho ra wikaskramko dherai mahatwapurna bhag ho.""
* **C: yesley naya prajatiko nirmanlai sambodhan garcha** (it addresses the creation of new species): The passage defines speciation as the formation of new species.
* **D: yo hunu aniwarya ho** (it is inevitable): The passage states ""prajatikaran ek apariharya parinam ho..."" which means ""speciation is an inevitable consequence...""

Therefore, option A is the only one that contradicts the information provided in the passage.

*   Scales and claws on their feet
*   Laying eggs
*   Walking on two hind legs

The passage also states that many people don't think of birds as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.

Therefore, the feature NOT considered similar between birds and dinosaurs is:

**C: udney khubi** (the ability to fly)"
"anuchhed anusar, cycad biruwako kun bhag triceratopsley khana sakcha?","The passage states that some scientists believe Triceratops ate cycads. It also mentions that Triceratops could uproot rocks using its strong beak. Based on this information, the answer is:

**C: jara**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions that Triceratops could mash even tough branches and roots, which suggests it could eat the roots of the cycad.
*   Although the passage mentions ""kada patharu,"" and ""kanda"" those are describing the cycad itself, the passage doesn't directly say that the Triceratops ate those parts.
*   The passage talks about poisonous leaves and fruits, but says that it's *unlikely* a dinosaur would eat them.

"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey triceratopsley sabai bhanda dherai ke khana sakthyo? ","The correct answer is **B: Kada hangaharu bhayeka biruwa**.

The passage explicitly states:

*   Triceratops could crush hard branches and even roots.
*   Some scientists believe Triceratops ate cycads, a common type of plant in the Cretaceous period with hard, thorny leaves.

While the passage mentions that sloths and parrots can eat poisonous plants/fruits, it doesn't indicate that Triceratops did. The passage focuses on Triceratops' ability to eat hard plants."

The passage states: ""Halka samayama belgiumka anshaharu vigatma lakjambargako ansh thee tar 1830 co dashakko belgian krantipachhi belgium banna pugyo."" This translates to ""For a while, parts of Belgium were previously part of Luxembourg, but after the Belgian Revolution in the 1830s, Belgium came into being."" This clearly indicates that the Belgian Revolution led to some parts of Luxembourg becoming part of Belgium.

"
"anuchhed anusar, turkey lagbhag kati miles lamo cha?","The correct answer is **D: 1000**.

The passage states: ""Tarkiko kshetrafal 1,600 kilometer (1,000 mile) lambai ra 800 kimi (500 mile) chaudai..."" This translates to ""The area of Turkey is 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) long and 800 km (500 miles) wide...""
"
Bhyatikan siti ma latin bhasha keko lagi pragyo garincha?,"The correct answer is **A: dharmik samharoharu**.

The passage states: ""Latin prayaha dharmik samarohaharuma prayog hunchha"" which translates to ""Latin is mostly used in religious ceremonies.""
"
Bhyatikan siti ma italeli keko lagi prayog garindaina?,"The correct answer is **C: dharmik samharoharu (religious ceremonies)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Latin is primarily used for religious ceremonies, implying that Italian is not used for them. While Italian is used in official communication, daily communication, and other governmental functions within Vatican City, religious ceremonies are specifically highlighted as using Latin.
"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kunley parishkrit computerharuma swor misauda faida paunchha?","The correct answer is **A: Sangeet**.

The passage states: ""Eksath dhwaniharu prashodhan garna ra mixes garnaka lagi prayaha parishkrit computerharuko prayog garera sangeet record garinchha."" (Sophisticated computers are often used to record music by processing and mixing sounds together). This directly links music with benefiting from sound mixing in sophisticated computers.

The passage specifically states that the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets connected to a sophisticated drainage system in almost every house. While the other locations also had toilets or drainage systems, Harappa is specifically mentioned as having flush toilets integrated with a drainage system.

"anucched anusar, prakashbata parmanuharulai atirikta urja hatauna diney prakriyalai ke bhaninchha?","The correct answer is **D: wikiranko uttejit utsarjan**.

The passage states, ""Uniharule """"photon"""" bhanine prakashko sano kanalai utsarjan garera yaso gardachan. Vaigyanikharule yass prakriyalai """"wikiranko uttejit utsarjan"""" bhanchhan."" This directly identifies ""wikiranko uttejit utsarjan"" as the process by which atoms get rid of excess energy from light.
"
kun karanley euta parmanuley photon utsarjan garchha?,"The correct answer is **A: atirikta urja mukta garda** (to release excess energy).

The passage clearly states that atoms release photons to get rid of the extra energy they gained from light.  Option B is related but A is the core reason.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: chamkilo prakashko uttejanako karan** (due to the excitation of bright light): While bright light *causes* the atoms to gain the extra energy, it's the *energy* itself that forces the photon emission, not the light directly causing emission.
*   **C: asthir urja ka starharu** (unstable energy levels): While energy levels *are* unstable, the text implies there is a process when they fall back from excited states.
*   **D: wikiranko euta nakaratmak pratikriya** (a negative reaction of radiation): The passage doesn't describe the emission as a negative reaction. It's simply a mechanism to release energy."
"anuchhed anusar, antata ke karanley garda battiko bulb balna chodchha?","The correct answer is **C: bulb bhitrako filament balera** (the filament inside the bulb burns out).

The passage states: ""Sayaun ghantako sanchalan pachhi akhirma balbako filament balchha ra tyasapachhi light balbale cam gardaina."" This translates to: ""After hundreds of hours of operation, the bulb's filament eventually burns out, and then the light bulb stops working.""
"
nimna madhey kun battiko bulb ferda sambhawata khatarnak huna sakcha?,"The correct answer is **C: bulbko pidh (बल्बको पिँध)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that touching the metal base (pidh) of the bulb inside the socket, especially when part of it remains, can cause a severe electrical shock. The other options, while related to electricity, aren't directly highlighted as a danger point *during the bulb changing process* in the provided text.
"
"anuchhed anusar, nucleus vibhajan pachhi ke hunchha?","The correct answer is **B: urja mukta hunchha (urja mukta hunchha)**.

The passage states: ""Euta upagraha wa telescope antarikshama rakhna 100 fitbhanda badhi uchaiko vishal rocket chahinchha.""  This directly says that large rockets taller than 100 feet are needed to put satellites or telescopes into space.
"
samaya biteko track garnakolagi chakriya ghatanabarey ke tipnu parcha?,"The correct answer is **B: punararitti (repetition)**.

The passage states: ""Tapainle chakriya ghatanako punararitti awalokan garera aafainle samay biteko chinhit garna saknuhunchha."" This translates to: ""You can identify the passage of time by observing the repetition of a cyclical event.""

Therefore, to track the passage of time using a cyclical event, you need to note its repetition.
"
"anuchhed anusar, ghatanako kun paksha tulana garna samaya prayog garincha?","The correct answer is **A: lambai**.

The passage states: ""Hamile ghatanaharuko awadhi (lambai) tulana gurney tarika samay pani ho."" which translates to ""Time is also a way we compare the duration (length) of events.""

"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kelai sinhansanko uttaradhikariko lagi samanya manincha?","Anuchhed anusar, sinhasanko uttaradhikariharu skull siddhyaepachi sidha sainya sewama jane garthyo.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: senama varti huna aghi vishwavidyalaya janu** (Going to university before joining the army)

Although going straight into military service is traditionally the norm, going to university *before* military service is still inline with the paragraph.
"
"anuchhedma diyeko jankariko adharma, charles ke garna pahilo hun?","The correct answer is **C: degree prapta garnu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states, ""Vidyawaridhibata sammanit hune charles belayati shahi pariwarko pahilo sadasya thiye."" This translates to ""Charles was the first member of the British royal family to be honored with a doctorate."" Since obtaining a doctorate requires earning a degree, he was the first to get a degree in the British royal family."
trygvassonko samuha kun deshbata thiyo?,"The passage states that Olaf Tryggvasson was a Norwegian (""nervelli"") and wanted to reclaim his country from Danish (""denis"") rule. Therefore, his group was from Norway.

"
nimna madhey kun hangul sabdamalabarey sahi tathya hoina?,"The correct answer is **B: sabdamalako maulik nam hunan jeongeum thiyo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the original name of Hangul was ""Hunmin Jongum"", not ""Hunan Jeongeum"".

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: yo raja sejongko shasankalma awishkar bhayeko thiyo** - The passage states it was invented during the reign of King Sejong.
*   **C: yaslai joseon samrajyako chauthaun rajaley awishkar gariyeko thiyo** - The passage states that King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon dynasty.
*   **D: yo udhyashyapurvak awiskar gariyeko thiyo** - The passage mentions the name ""Hunmin Jongum"" which translates to ""the correct sounds for the instruction of the people"" showing a clear purpose behind its creation."
hunmin jeogeum sabdamala akhirma kema pariwartan gariyo?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangul**.

The passage states that Raja Sejong originally named the Hangul alphabet ""Hunmin Jeongeum"". It later states that the Hangul alphabet is a popular alphabet in daily use, implying that ""Hunmin Jeongeum"" was eventually changed to ""Hangul"".
"
"annuched anusar, kun bhashaharu sanskritdwara prabhawit bhayeka chhan?","The correct answer is **D: Bharatiya bhashaharu**.

The paragraph states: ""Francelli ra spanish jasta europeli bhashaharuka srota latin jastai bharatiya bhashaharuka lagi sanskrit dherai jatil ra dhani bhasha srota banna pugyo."" This directly implies that Sanskrit served as a significant source language for Indian languages.
"
"anuchhed anusar, sanskritko pragyo ke karanley kam bhayeko thiyo?","The correct answer is **D: padanukram**.

The passage states, ""Upanishadharuko sangraha pashchat sanskrit padanukramka karan matra fikka bhayo."" This translates to ""Only after the collection of Upanishads did Sanskrit fade due to the Sanskrit grammatical order.""  Therefore, the grammatical order (padanukram) is the reason given for Sanskrit's decline in prominence.
"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun loko gurutwakarshanbarey sahi kathan ho?","The passage states that if you were on Io, your weight would be less than on Earth. This implies that Io's gravity pulls on you less than Earth's gravity. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: prithviko gurutwakarshanley tapailai loko gurutwakarshanley bhanda badhi tanthiyo** (Earth's gravity pulls you more than Io's gravity).

"
"anuchhed anusar, chandramako crust sabbhanda dherai kanha baklo chha?","The correct answer is **C: highlandharu muni**.

The passage clearly states: ""Yo mariamuni patlo ra highlandharu muni baklo hunchha."" (It is thin under the maria and thick under the highlands.) Therefore, the lunar crust is thickest under the highlands.
"
"anuchhedko adharma, nimna madhey kun kura nischit manisharuley vishwash gardachhan?","The correct answer is **C: anya grahaharuma jiwan cha**.

The passage states, ""...kehiley alien wa any jeevan arko sanyantrama banchna sakne vishwas gardachan."" ( ... some believe that aliens or other life can live on another planet.) This directly implies that some people believe there is life on other planets.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: manavharuley arko tarama yatra garisakye (Humans have already traveled to another star)** - The passage discusses the *dream* of traveling to other stars, not the reality.
*   **B: manavharu anya sansar anweshan garna yogya chhainan (Humans are not capable of exploring other worlds)** - The passage doesn't say humans *cannot* explore other worlds, only that it is a distant prospect.
*   **D: taraharu bich trillion mileharu bhanda kam duri chha (The distance between stars is less than trillions of miles)** - The passage states the *opposite*: ""...taraharu yatisamma failieka chan key """"chhimeki"""" taraharuka bichma kharbaun mileko duree cha."" (stars are so far apart that there are trillions of miles between ""neighboring"" stars.) Therefore, the distance is trillions of miles, not less.

"

The passage states: ""Tapain surya kendrabata tadha jaanda gas patlo hundai janchha."" which translates to ""As you move further away from the center of the sun, the gas becomes thinner.""
"
"anuchhed anusar, prithvibata suryako kun bhag spashta dekhinchha?","The correct answer is **C: photosphere**.

anuchhedma ullekhit kun camley sabaibhanda thorai bhenejuelaka manisharulai rozgar dincha?,"Correct answer is C: Tell

Here's why:

*   **P** states that only **1%** of Venezuelans work in the oil (tell) industry.
*   It also mentions that 1/4 work in the industry sector and 1/5 work in the agricultural sector.
*   2/3 of Venezuelans work in the service sector.

Therefore, oil (tell) employs the smallest percentage of Venezuelans."

The paragraph states: ""Hydrogen paramanuharu ek apasma vilaya (wa fuse) bhaera bhari tatwaharu banaunda baneko urjaka karan taraharule prakash ra tap dinchhan.""  This translates to: ""Because of the energy produced when hydrogen atoms fuse together (or fuse) to form heavier elements, stars give off light and heat.""

Therefore, fusion allows stars to give off light and heat.
"

paniko rasayanik banawat ke ho?,"The correct answer is **D: duita hydrogen parmanuharu ra euta oxygen parmau**.

The passage states that water is composed of ""dui hydrogen ra ek oxygen paramanu"" which translates to ""two hydrogen and one oxygen atom"".
"

Chahe yo gyaans, taral wa thos jay bhaepani yasako ustai anawik sanrachana raheko cha. Yasako rasayanik awastha uhi rahe tapani yasako bhautik awastha parivartan hoon sakcha.""

This means that even when water changes its form (gas, liquid, solid), its molecular structure remains the same.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: anawik rachana** (molecular structure).

"anuchhed anusar, gija piramidharuko kun viseshta lai naya rajya egyptianharuley prasamsha nagarney sambhawana thiyo?","The passage states that the New Kingdom Egyptians were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors (the Old Kingdom Egyptians, who built the Giza pyramids). The passage *also* states that while the Giza pyramids' technical excellence in shape and construction was never surpassed, the Old Kingdom Egyptians **failed** to continue pyramid construction in stone until the end of the Old Kingdom.

This means the New Kingdom Egyptians admired the shape and construction excellence of the Giza pyramids. They used stone in their own monuments, so using stone would not have been something they *didn't* admire. The passage states they were amazed by *predecessor* monuments, implying the age *was* a factor in their admiration.

The fact that the Old Kingdom Egyptians *couldn't* maintain stone pyramid construction until the end of the Old Kingdom suggests a potential shortcoming in the *sustainability* or continuation of that type of construction.  Therefore, the New Kingdom Egyptians might not have praised that *lack of sustained construction*.

So, the answer is (D) Tiniharuko nirman (their construction) - specifically, the *lack of sustained* ability to construct stone pyramids over the long term.  The other qualities of construction (shape, excellence) WERE admired.

(Every year around October, approximately 1.5 million herbivores cross the Mara River from the northern hills and travel towards the southern plains for the year.)
"
"anuchhed anusar, aprilko cheuchau sahakariharu kun kshetrabata prasthan gardachan?","The correct answer is **B: dakshini maidanharutarf**.

The paragraph states they migrate *from* the northern hills *to* the southern plains around October, and then around April, they cross the Mara River again *after* the rains, and then head west *before* returning north. This implies they are in the southern plains when April arrives.

"
kelai italyko african deshharu kabja garney yojanakolagi mahatwpurna charan vanera ullekhit chaina?,"Correct answer is **C: fauj prakshepan padko sthapana**.

The passage explicitly states that to invade African countries, Italy needed a ""fauj prakshepan pad"" (army projection pad) to transport their forces across the Mediterranean.  Therefore, establishing this pad was a crucial step in their plan.

While destroying the British bases in Egypt (D) was important to eliminate a threat, it was a means to an end, not a stage in the plan itself. The plan was invasion. The pad was the logistical mean to realize that invasion.
"
"anuchhed anuaar, italyko yuddhako prathamik lakshya ke maninthiyo?","Correct Answer: A

The paragraph explicitly states: ""Italyka mukhya lakshyaharu african deshharu thee. tee deshharu kabza garna..."". This translates to ""Italy's main goals were African countries. To occupy those countries...""

"
"anuchhed anusar, kasley samjhauta ullanghan garyo? ","The answer is **D: Sovietharu**.

The passage states that the Soviet Union violated treaties (Riga Peace Treaty, Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties) by invading eastern Poland.
"
nimna madhey red sainik le ke garenan?,"The passage states the following actions of the Red Army:

*   Entered Poland's eastern territories with over 800,000 soldiers.
*   Created Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
*   Violated the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties.

Let's compare these to the options:

*   **A: ukreni morchako srijana** - ukreni morchako srijana (Creation of the Ukrainian front) - This is stated in the passage.
*   **B: purwi kshetra ko akraman** - purwi kshetra ko akraman (Invasion of the eastern territories) - This is stated in the passage.
*   **C: pulko shir bhag ko punargathan** - pulko shir bhag ko punargathan (Reconstruction of the bridgehead) - This is NOT mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: sandhiko ullanghan** - sandhiko ullanghan (Violation of the treaty) - This is stated in the passage.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: pulko shir bhag ko punargathan**."

The passage states: ""Bardiyako purvi bhagma bhaeko akramanma, belayati senale italian dasaun senaka engineer-inn-chief, general lastuchilai pakrau garen.""

"

The passage states, ""June 28 maa, tobrookma awataran gurney kramama liviaka governor general ra muslinika spashta uttaradhikari marcel italo balbo maitri golibarima mariye.""

"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun tarika tibatti dhyanko mahatwapurna bhag ho?","The correct answer is **C: deutaharu chitran garnu** (visualizing deities).

The passage states: ""Tibeti dhyanko kendra devta yog ho. vibhinna dewataharuko drishyatako madhyambata urja channelharu safa garinchhan, chakraharu sakriya hunchhan ra atmagyan chetna sirjana hunchha."" (Tibetan meditation's focus is deity yoga. Through visualization of different deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated, and self-awareness is created.)

This directly supports option C. The other options are related to Kundalini Yoga, which is *part* of Tibetan Buddhism, but not specifically the core of Tibetan meditation as described in the passage.
"
"anuchhed anusar, tibatti dhyanko “kendra” ma chakraharu kasari sakriya garincha?","The correct answer is **B: dewataharu ko chitran garera**.

The passage states: ""Tibeti dhyanko kendra devta yog ho. vibhinna dewataharuko drishyatako madhyambata urja channelharu safa garinchhan, chakraharu sakriya hunchhan ra atmagyan chetna sirjana hunchha.""

This translates to: ""The center of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated, and self-awareness consciousness is created.""

Therefore, the chakras are activated by visualizing or picturing deities.

The passage states: ""Italian tenor tennis Alessandro safina..."" which clearly indicates that Alessandro Safina is Italian.
"
"annuchedko adharma, nimna madhey kun kathan satya hoina?","The correct answer is **A: santa clarama ago lageko thiyo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes people waiting in 90-degree Fahrenheit heat. A fire captain, Scott Counsel, is quoted saying Santa Clara was ""very hot"" that day. He also says it was uncomfortable to be stuck on a roller coaster and that it took an hour to get the first person off the ride.
*   **B: manisharu roller coasterma adkeka thiye** - This is true, as stated by the fire captain.
*   **C: yatruharulai pani diyeko thiyo** - This is true, the passage says, ""yatruharu 90 (fahrenheit) degreeko garmima pratiksha garirahanda uniharulai pani diieko thiyo.""
*   **D: sawaribata pahilo wyaktilai nikalna 60 minet lagyo** - This is true. The passage says, ""...pahilo wyaktilai sawaribata bahira nikalna ek ghanta lynn sakthyo."" ""Ek ghanta"" means one hour, or 60 minutes.
*   **A: santa clarama ago lageko thiyo** - The passage does not mention any fire. While a fire captain is quoted, he is speaking about the heat and the roller coaster incident. There is no indication of a fire in Santa Clara."
"anuchhed anusar, asahaj tapakrambarey kasley tippani garyo?","The correct answer is **B: fire kaptan**.

The passage states:  ""santa clarama 90 ko dashak tapakram dina tato bhaeko thiyo"""""""" fire kaptan scott counsele bhane.""  This directly attributes the comment about the uncomfortable temperature to Fire Captain Scott Counsele.

prahariley kahiley johnny reidko driving gati janch garna radar bandukharu prayog garna sakshyam bhaye?,"Correct Answer: C: jaba uni 160 kilometer prati ghanta bhanda badi gadi hakiraheka thiye

Explanation: The passage states that the police were trying to compare Mr. Reid's speed with the Black Beauty ""when he was driving faster than 160 km/h"" using their speed radar guns. So, the correct answer is C.
"
"anuchhed anusar, new zelandko prahariharulai jonny reidko gati janchna kina gahro bhayeko thiyo?","The correct answer is **A: unley 160 kilometer pratighanta bhanda kam gati ma gadi hakiraheko thiyo**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that when the New Zealand police tried to use their speed radar gun to compare Mr. Reid's speed with the Black Beauty, a problem arose. Then, it specifically mentions that when the police observed Mr. Reid, he had reduced his speed to 160 km/h. This implies that his *actual* speed was sometimes higher than what the radar gun was able to capture, as he reduced it before the police fully locked on with the radar.

Let's eliminate the other options:

* **B: car ekdumai muni thiyo** - The passage doesn't mention anything about the car being too low.
* **C: unley pulmathi matra saat patak gadi haake** - The number of times he drove on the bridge isn't related to the difficulty the police had in measuring his speed.
* **D: auckland harbour pul dherai purano chha** - The age of the bridge isn't related to the police's difficulties in measuring his speed.
"
butteko tulanama bhukampa ko kendra kaha thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 miles dakshin**.

The passage states the epicenter was ""byutko karib 65 kimi (40 mile) dakshinma thiyo,"" which translates to ""about 40 miles south of Butte"".
"

"
iraqi karagar kina badanam bhayo? ,"The correct answer is **D: kaidi durwyawahar patta lagepchhi** (After prisoner abuse was discovered).

The passage states that Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq was infamous after prisoner abuse was discovered following its capture by American forces. Therefore, the discovery of prisoner abuse is the reason for the prison's infamy.
"

"
bishkekka basindaharule lutpatko jimmewar ko thiyebhanera soche?,"The passage states: ""Bishkeka kayaun basindaharule dakshinbata aeka pradarshankariharule kanuna palana nagareko dosh diye."" This translates to: ""Many residents of Bishkek blamed the protesters who came from the south for not following the law."" Given the context of looting, this implies they blamed the protesters for the looting.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: Pradarshankariharu (Protesters).
"
lutpatkolagi dakshinko pradarshankariharuko kasley ninda garyo?,"The correct answer is **A: Bishkekka basindaharu**.

The passage states: ""Bishkeka kayaun basindaharule dakshinbata aeka pradarshankariharule kanuna palana nagareko dosh diye."" This translates to ""Many residents of Bishkek blamed the protesters who came from the south for not following the law."" Thus, they are the ones condemning the actions that led to the looting.
"
ringley kahiley bikri badheko anubhav garyo?,"Correct answer is **A: Sark tankma dekha parye pachi** (After appearing on Shark Tank).

The passage states that Siminoff said sales increased after his appearance on Shark Tank in the summer of 2013.
"
jamie siminoffley kahiey ring suruwat garney nirnay gare?,"Correct answer is **A: unkoo afnai dhoka ghanti aparyapta chha bhanne mahasus gare pachhi**

The passage clearly states that Jamie Siminoff started the company because his own doorbell in the garage was inadequate (""Yasaghi, ringka ceo, Jammy Siminafle afno pasalko dhoka ghanti afno gyarejma shraanyogya nabhaeko beladekhi company suru gareko tippani garnubhayo."")

The other options are incorrect because:

*   B: Sark Tankma upasthiti asafal bhaye pachhi: While his appearance on Shark Tank led to increased sales later, it wasn't the reason he started the company.
*   C: Wittiya surakshit garye pachi: The passage doesn't mention him securing funding *before* starting the company.
*   D: QVCma safal upasthiti pachhi: His QVC appearance happened much later in the company's development."

This translates to: ""...Each program also provides recommendations for books for children to look at when they go to the library.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: kitabharu** (books).
"
reading rainbow shrinkhalako kharijima ke ko haat huna sakcha?,"The correct answer is **A: apug lagani (apug lagani)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""...Zone Grant lagayat kehi wyaktiharule yo vishwas garchhan key koshko samasya ra shaikshik television programingko darshan duwaile shringkhala samapta garna yogdan puryae."" This translates to, ""...some people, including Zone Grant, believe that key financial problems (koshko samasya) and the philosophy of educational television programming contributed to the series ending.""

The passage directly links financial problems (""koshko samasya"") to the show's cancellation. ""Apug lagani"" means insufficient investment or funding, making it the most accurate answer choice.

Given the context of the passage (slaughterhouses, animal welfare), ""kidnappers"" is likely a mistranslation or misinterpretation. The correct interpretation is ""those who handle animals"".

Therefore, the answer is **B: janawarharusanga cam garney jokohi** (those who handle animals).
"
"anuchhed anusar, australiali khasaikhanaka kamdaarharulai ke kura pashu kalyanko mahatwa bujhna maddat garna sakcha?","The correct answer is **A: cctv camerako sthapana**

*   Flood-resistant homes (C)
*   To help affected countries cope with global warming effects (D) - This is a general statement, encompassing building resistance and better water management and crop diversification

The fund directly supports crop diversification, therefore ""anna vividhikaran"" is *not* the correct answer. However, there must be a error in the original prompt, as the passage says that the fund *will* be used for ""anna vividhikaran.""

It seems the prompt may have intended to ask a different question. Please check the original question and options to ensure accuracy.

"anuchhed anusar, sanyukta rashtrasangh ke bachauney asha rakheko cha?","The correct answer is **A: paisa, praidhi sajha garera**

Here's why:

* The passage states:  ""Yasaka sathai, vishwawyapi ushnatale prabhawa pareka deshharulai yasaka asarharusanga samana garna sahayog garna sanyukta rashtrasanghale yasasambandhi koshlai antim roop dine asha rakheko cha."" This translates to: ""Along with this, the United Nations hopes to finalize a fund related to helping countries affected by global warming cope with its effects."" The passage then describes where the money could be used - flood resistant houses, water management, and crop diversification. The initial part of the passage describes that the agenda includes preserving remaining jungles and helping developing nations develop in a less polluting manner by sharing technology and mobilizing funds.

Therefore, the United Nations hopes to finalize the fund (kosh) that is made up of sharing money (paisa) and technology (praidhi).

nimna madhey kun albert muchangaley kehi kura ajhai sammat hunu parney awashyak cha bhanera ullekhit gareko chaina?,"The correct answer is **A: yedi benin afcTAsanga abadha huncha bhaney**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states Muchanga said they haven't yet agreed on ""utpattika niyamharu"" (rules of origin) and ""shulkadar riyayatharu"" (tariff concessions). This eliminates options C and D.
*   The passage also talks about having enough framework to start trade by July 1, 2020. So, though not a matter of ""agreement,"" it is something that needed to be realized by that date.
*   The passage mentions Benin but doesn't say that Muchanga needs to agree on whether Benin joins AfCFTA. It is a simple announcement of their visit to Benin. The rest of the statement focuses on internal agreements/frameworks needed within AfCFTA itself.
"
"anuchhed anusar, wyapar kina julyma suru hunasakcha?","The correct answer is **C: tyo AU vyapar ra udhyog ayuktaley thik cha bhanney thahar gareka chan**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Ayuktale bhane, 'hamile ahilesamma utpattika niyamharu ra shulkadar riyayatharu swikar gareka chhainaun tar hamisanga bhaeko ruparekha july 1, 2020 maa wyapar suru garna paryapta cha.'"" This means the AU Trade and Industry Commissioner has determined that the existing framework is sufficient to begin trade in July, even though some details are not yet finalized.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: afCFTAsanga abadha huna july suruwaat miti nigeriako sart thiyo** The passage does not say that the July start date was Nigeria's condition for joining the AfCFTA.
*   **B: tyaha niyamharu ra chutharuko paryapta samrachana awasthit chha** The passage explicitly says that the rules of origin and tariff concessions have not yet been agreed upon.
*   **D: utpatti niyamharu ra tariff ko chut ma sahamati bhaiskeko chha** The passage explicitly says that the rules of origin and tariff concessions have not yet been agreed upon."
"anuchhed anusar, atlanta journal-constitutionley shikshya adhikariharulai keko dosh lagaye?","The correct answer is **C: fela pareko antarik samasyaharuma karya nagareko**.

The passage states that ""The Atlanta Journal-Constitution published a report pointing out problems in test results. The report showed that test scores had increased rapidly and accused the schools of identifying internal problems but not acting on their findings."" This directly supports option C. The other options are not supported by the excerpt.

"anuchhed anusar, bum wisfot pachi ke jankari thaha vayo?","The correct answer is **D: mritak haruko aupachaarik sankhya**.

Here's why:

*   The paragraph states: ""Kehi pratiwedanharule adhikarik mrityuko sankhya atha bhaneka thee ra adhikarik pratiwedanle kamtima 30 jana ghaite bhaeko pushti gareko thiyo; tar antim sankhya ajhai thaha hoon sakeko chhaina."" (Some reports said the official death toll was eight, and official reports confirmed at least 30 people were injured; but the final number is still unknown). This clearly indicates that the official number of deaths was *not* yet known at the time the paragraph was written.
*   The first sentence answers Option B, so it is *known*.
*   The paragraph does not mention or imply Option C, so that answer is incorrect.
*   The paragraph states that the final count of injured people is unknown, so A is incorrect.

Therefore, the only piece of information still unknown according to the passage is the official death toll."
"2017 ma manchester cityma samel bhayepachi, jesusley katiwata khel khele?","The text says that after joining Palmeiras, Jesus played in 53 matches in all competitions for the Brazilian club. The question asks how many matches Jesus played after joining Manchester City in 2017. However, the passage says he joined Palmeiras in 2017, not Manchester City.

The passage does state he joined Manchester City for £27 million, but doesn't give information about how many matches he played for them. It *does* say he played 53 games for Palmeiras after joining that club in January 2017.

Therefore, none of the provided answers is correct based on the information given. However, if the question was about his time at **Palmeiras**, the answer would be 53. Given the options, the most likely answer is:

D: 53
"
jesusley kun clubma samel vayeko bapat £27 million shulka prapta gare?,"The correct answer is **B: manchester city**.

The passage states that Jesus joined Manchester City for a fee of £27 million from Brazilian club Palmeiras.

"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun kathan satya hoina?","The correct answer is **D: bahumat pahunaharu meccaka sthaniyaharu thiye**. Here's why:

*   **A: tyaha kasaiko mirtyu bhayena** - The passage states that the death toll is at least 15, so this statement is false.
*   **B: sabai pahunaharu sanyukta arab imiratesbata thiye** - The passage says *dherai* (many) guests were from the United Arab Emirates, not *sabai* (all). Therefore, this is false.
*   **C: pahunaharu hajj tirthayatrako purva sandhyakalagi tyaha thiye** - This is stated directly in the passage, so it's true.
*   **D: bahumat pahunaharu meccaka sthaniyaharu thiye** - The passage does not say or imply that the majority of guests were locals. It implies the opposite - that they were pilgrims visiting Mecca for Hajj. Therefore, this statement is false.

**Therefore, the best answer is D, as this is the one statement that is definitively false based on the information provided.** B is also false, but the passage specifically points out it was *many* guests who were from the UAE. D is not stated in any way, so it is a better answer."
"anuchhedko adharma,thakkarbarey kun jankari nischit chaina?","Correct answer is **C: thakkar ko prithvima asar**

The passage states ""Tiniharu durghatana kathi thulo thiyo ra prithvi kasari prabhawit hunechha bhane nirdharan garna ajhai pani cosis gardaichhan,"" which translates to ""They are still trying to determine how big the accident was and how it will affect the earth."" This means the effect of the collision on Earth is not yet certain.

The other options are incorrect because:
*   **A: thakkar ko akar** - While the exact size might not be explicitly stated, the scientists are trying to determine ""kathi thulo thiyo"" (how big it was), implying some knowledge of its size.
*   **B: thakkar ko sthan** - It talks about tracking debris, implying the location of the impact is known enough to begin tracking.
*   **D: bhatkeka awasheshharuko sthan** - The passage explicitly states that the US Department of Defense's Strategic Command is tracking the debris."
"anuchhed anusar, thakkarbarey ajhai ke nishchit garna awashak cha?","The correct answer is **D: durghatanako sahi maan** (the exact magnitude of the accident).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tiniharu durghatana kathi thulo thiyo ra prithvi kasari prabhawit hunechha bhane nirdharan garna ajhai pani cosis gardaichhan."" (They are still trying to determine how big the accident was and how it will affect the Earth.) This directly translates to needing to determine the exact magnitude of the accident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: bhatkeka awasheshharu kasley track garcha** (who is tracking the debris) - The passage already states that the United States Department of Defense Strategic Command is tracking the debris.
*   **B: thakkarko samayma upagrahaharu kati chhito yatra gariraheka thiye** (how fast the satellites were traveling at the time of the collision) - The passage doesn't mention anything about satellite speed.
*   **C: plotting vishleshanko natija kasari sajha garincha** (how the plotting analysis results are shared) - The passage states that the results will be placed on a public website, so how they are shared is already known."
"anuchhed anusar, battenley ekpatak sabaibhanda dhani amerikiharuko suchima kun sthan ogateko thiyo?","Correct answer is **C: 190 aun**

The passage explicitly states: ""Batten sun 2008 ko sabaibhanda dhani 400 amerikiharuko suchima **190 aun** sthanma raheka thee..."" which translates to ""In 2008, Batten was ranked **190th** in the list of the 400 richest Americans...""

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically mentions that the law applies to violent video games sold in **California**. It doesn't mention anything about restricting sales *outside* of California.

The other options are elements included in the new law:

*   **A: californiabhari sana bachchaharulaihinsatmak bhidiyo gameharuko bikri wa bhadama pratibandha** - This is a direct part of the law.
*   **B: apradhiharulai arthik jariwana** - The law states a $1000 fine for selling restricted games to minors.
*   **D: hinsatmak bhidiyo gameharuma decal ko awashyakta** - The law requires violent video games to be labeled ""18""."
"anuchhed anusar, kasley vaniyeka chijharu chuttaye?","Correct Answer: **C: miller**

The passage states that ""Millerle bhane"" (Miller said), and then quotes what Miller said. Therefore, Miller separated the things that were said.
"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna mandhey kun sunwaiko bela millerko anubhavbarey satya ho?","The correct answer is **B: uni tayar hunda unle khyal gariraheko thiyenan**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""maha tayar bhairaheko thien tyasaile maha unle key bhaniraheka thee bhanera sanchchai nai suniraheko thien."" This translates to ""I was getting ready, so I wasn't really listening to what he was saying.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: sunwaiko bela duvallley millermathi ramro prabhav pare (Duvall made a good impression on Miller during the hearing)** - The passage indicates the opposite; Miller was distracted and not really paying attention.
*   **C: sunwaiko bela duvallko duita bacchaharuley dherai boliraheka thiye (Duvall's two children were talking a lot during the hearing)** - The passage mentions Duvall had two adult children but does not say they were present or talking during the hearing.
*   **D: unle duvallko kathalai ramro sanga dhyan diraheka thiye (He was paying close attention to Duvall's story)** - Again, the passage explicitly states that Miller *wasn't* really listening."
“swachcha hawasambadhi ein” lai samsodhan garnuparcha vanera kasley sujhav garyo?,"The correct answer is **C: jack layton**.

The passage states that Jack Layton urged the Prime Minister to change the Conservative's environmental bill. He advocated for a ""detailed and complete rewrite"" of the Conservative Party's environmental bill. This implies he suggested amending or revising the ""swachcha hawasambadhi ein"" (clean air act) which is the environmental bill being discussed.
"
“swachcha hawasambadhi ein” chunabh purwi tamasha ho vanera kasley khandan garyo?,"The passage says ""rajya sarkar ra kehi sanghiya sansadharule novembersamma bolaunu parne sanghiya chunawako prastawanako yo karyalai alochanako rupma lie."" This translates to ""the state government and some federal parliamentarians criticized this move as a proposal for the federal election that should be called by November."" This implies the state government and some federal MPs criticized it.

Therefore, the best answer from the options is:

**A: rajya sarkar adhikari** (state government officials) and **D: euta sanghiya mp** (a federal MP) are both technically correct.

However, if I can only choose one I will choose A. While it is likely ""kehi sanghiya sansadharule"" is meant to be ""some federal MPs,"" ""sansadharule"" is not the same word as ""mp"" and I cannot be certain. Also, the term ""mp"" in this context should be sanghiya or ""federal"" as ""mp"" has a different context if it is not a federal issue. I will therefore choose:

**A: rajya sarkar adhikari**

"
durghatnama samlagna bhaeko chalaklai ke bhayena?,"The correct answer is **A: usko taukoma chotpatak lagyo** (He was injured in the head).

Here's why:

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: usley gharma bhayeka kunai pani wyaktiharulai chotpatak purayena:** While the passengers inside the car were uninjured, this option is irrelevant to the question asking what happened to *the driver*. Also, the location of the incident is a car, not a house.
*   **C: uslai cambridgeko aspatalbata great yarmouthma sario:** The passage states the opposite: he was moved *from* Great Yarmouth to Cambridge.
*   **D: apatkalin sewaharule uslai usko gadibata nikalna maddat garye:** This is true, but the question asks specifically *what happened to the driver*. This option describes what others did for him, not what happened to him directly."

Hule clearly states that developing countries should be encouraged to ""avoid the path of polluting first and cleaning up later."" This aligns perfectly with option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: tyasto dayitwa linu jasley uniharuko vikas charanlai dhakalcha (Take on responsibilities that hinder their development stage):** Hule explicitly states they *should not* be forced to take on responsibilities beyond their capacity.

*   **B: arthik parinamma dhyan kendrit garnu (Focus on economic outcome):** It is suggested to focus on economic output, so it is a positive part of Hule's plan.

The passage states ""natakghar aafainle shrotaharulai samel hoon protsahit gariraheko hunchha"", meaning the theater itself is encouraging the audience to participate. Since the actors are smoking marijuana on stage, and the theater is encouraging participation, the logical conclusion is that they are encouraging the audience to use marijuana as well.

The passage states: ""Durghatanapachhi, Gibsanlai aspatalma lagiyo tar kehi samayapachi unko mrityu bhayo."" (After the accident, Gibson was taken to the hospital, but he died some time later.). This clearly indicates that Gibson was injured in the accident.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **C: bachchaharu** (children): The passage says the children were waiting to cross the road and were crying, but it doesn't say they were injured.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: samanya padartha (Regular matter):** While regular matter is present, the focus of the research is on the interaction of **dark matter**.
*   **B: jwalanta shaktiharu (Tidal forces):** The passage mentions tidal forces as the mechanism *through which* dark matter's influence might be observed, not as the effect *itself*.
*   **C: sano kanaharu (Small particles):** While dark matter is theorized to be made of small particles, the question is asking about the *effects* the scientists are looking for, not the composition of dark matter itself."

The passage explicitly states: ""Stardust prithvima farkanka lagi sabaibhanda chhito antariksha yanka lagi naya sarva-samay kirtiman sthapit garnechha..."" which translates to ""Stardust will set a new all-time record for the fastest spacecraft to return to Earth...""

dr. Maller Balasubramaniamko Saroja Balasubramaniansaga ke sambandha thiyo?,"Correct answer is **C: aama** (mother).

The passage states ""key pensylvaniako pitsbergsthit childrens aspatalma cam gurney ekjana doctorlai budhwar unaki ama afno karko dibbama mrit awasthama fella pareki hunale unko hatya gurney abhiyog lagnechha."" This translates to ""Cam Gurney, a doctor at Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, will be charged with murder on Wednesday because his mother was found dead in the trunk of his car."" Later, the passage mentions Dr. Maller Balasubramaniam, and then states ""...53 warshe Saroja Balasubramanian co shab ragatko dag lageko kamballe dhakieko bhettae,"" which translates to ""...the body of 53-year-old Saroja Balasubramanian was found covered with a blood-stained blanket.""

Given that Maller Balasubramaniam will be charged because his mother was found dead, and the dead body is identified as Saroja Balasubramanian, it means Dr. Maller Balasubramaniam and Saroja Balasubramanian have a mother-child relationship.
"
Sara Balasubramanianko shab kaha fela pareko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **C: carko dibbima**.

The passage states: ""unaki ama afno karko dibbama mrit awasthama fella pareki hunale unko hatya gurney abhiyog lagnechha,"" which translates to ""his mother was found dead in the trunk of her car, leading to his indictment for murder.""
"

The passage states that ""Yo ee-beco itihasma sabaibhanda thulo adhigrahan ho. ...china, purvi europe ra brazil jasta skypeko baliyo prabhawa pareka kshetraharuma lokpriyata hasil gurney asha rakheko cha."" which translates to ""This is the biggest acquisition in the history of e-be... Hoping to gain popularity in areas with a strong Skype presence such as China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil.""

Therefore, e-be acquired Skype.

"anuchhed anusar, yuddha-pachi parisarma rahane bandiharusita kasle kurakani garena?","Correct answer is **D: aspatalko karmachari**

Here's why:

*   The paragraph mentions *madhyastakartaharu* (mediators) trying to improve the situation with the prisoners.
*   It mentions *adhikariharu* (officials) entering the yard in riot gear and using tear gas.
*   It mentions *agalagi bachao dalle* (fire rescue team) extinguishing the fire.

It *does not* mention hospital staff interacting with the prisoners who stayed in the prison after the war."
nimna madhey akhirkaar keley garda bandiharu danga garnabata pachi sare?,"Correct answer is **B: Ashru Gas**

The passage explicitly states that the officials entered the yard and surrounded the prisoners with tear gas (""bandiharulai ashru gasle ghera hale""). This directly precedes the information about the fire being controlled and suggests that the tear gas was the direct cause of the prisoners stopping the riot.
"
"ayatola ally khamaneiko vicharmaa, iran deshley afulai kebata mukta garaunu pardacha?","The correct answer is **D: telma nirbharta**.

The passage states that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei described oil exports as a ""trap"" that began before the Iranian Islamic Revolution in 1979 and that the country needed to become independent from it. This clearly indicates a need to break free from dependence on oil. While the financial sanctions (wittiya pratibandha) and foreign income (vaidashik amdani) are results of the oil situation, the root cause according to Khamenei is the reliance on oil itself. Islamic Kranti happened already.
"
"anuchhed anusar, kasley iranko arthatantrama pratibandhako asarharu swikar garyo?","The correct answer is **A: warishtha sutraharu (senior sources)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Tika-tippaniharu, televisionma pratyaksha, pahilo patak thee key warishtha irani sutraharule pratibandhako kunai asar bhairaheko swikar gare."" This translates to ""For the first time, key senior Iranian sources admitted on television that sanctions were having some effect.""

The passage states: ""...matadataharu boothma eklai janchhan, afno chhanautako ummedwar janaune purva-print garieko kagajko panalai khamma halchhan."" This translates to ""voters go to the booth alone, put the pre-printed paper with their choice of candidate into an envelope.""
"
allenlai musasiko aath-barsha khoj suru garna kun kurale prerit garyo?,"The correct answer is **D: yuddhama unko ruchi**.

The passage states that Allen's eight-year search for the Musashi was started ""after a lifelong fascination with wartime history."" While Allen also invested money in marine exploration (C), and the discovery involved seabed mapping (B), and his wealth played a part, the primary motivation was his lifelong interest in war.
"
"anuchhed anusar, allenley unko dheraijaso dhan kema kharcha garyo?","The correct answer is **B: samudri anweshan** (समुद्री अन्वेषण - marine exploration).

The passage states: ""Sansarkai sabaibhanda dhani wyaktimadhye ek, alenle kathit rupma afno dheraijaso dhan samudri anweshanma lagani gare..."" which translates to ""One of the richest people in the world, Allen reportedly invested most of his wealth in marine exploration...""

plantko ghatana pachi nimna madhey kun kura sthaniya basindaharulai sujhav gariyeko suraksha sallahaharu hoina?,"The passage states the following safety advice given to the residents:

*   Stay indoors (ghar bhitra rahan)
*   Turn off air conditioners (watanukulan band garna)
*   Do not drink tap water (nalaka pani napiuna)

Option C, ""seto dhuwa swash bhitra linabata jogina"" (avoid inhaling the white smoke), is not explicitly mentioned in the passage. Although it is a logical precaution given the situation, it is not something the local authorities are stated to have specifically advised.

Therefore, the answer is **C: seto dhuwa swash bhitra linabata jogina**."
"dr. mollko anusar, xdr-tb sambandhi sabaibhanda chintajank kura kun ho?","The passage states: ""Ek antarwartama, uhaanle naya sanskaran """"""""dherai uccha mrityu darka karan dherai uccha chintajanak ra darlagdo thiyo"""""""" bhanera bhannubhayo.""

This translates to: ""In an interview, he said the new strain was ""very worrying and scary due to its very high mortality rate"".""

Therefore, the most worrying thing about XDR-TB, according to Dr. Moll, is its high mortality rate.

The correct answer is **D: yesko uccha mrityu dar** (its high mortality rate).
"

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: 2**
"
nextgen pranalile kasto prakarko prawidhi prayog garcha?,"The correct answer is **A: upgrahama-adharit prawidhi**.

The passage states that NextGen uses satellite-based technology (""bhuupgraha-adharit praidhi"") instead of the older ground-radar-based approach. Therefore, option A is the most accurate.
"
nextgenley kasari vayu traffic niyantrakharulai sidhai faida gardacha?,"The passage says that NextGen helps air traffic controllers by ""allowing air traffic controllers to be more precise with air traffic."" This means they can more accurately manage the planes. None of the given options directly describe this.

However, consider the overall impact. Being able to be more precise likely leads to shorter flight paths and more efficient traffic management. Of the given options, the most likely direct benefit to air traffic controllers stemming from this is enabling:

* **A: vimanharu ko chhoto udan marga (shorter flight paths for planes)**

While carbon reduction and fuel savings are benefits of NextGen, they are not *direct* benefits to the controllers themselves.

The passage states: ""Sthaniya mediale pratikriyako kramama wimansthalko agni niyantrak sawari paltieko suchana diyo"" which translates to ""Local media reported that an airport fire engine overturned in response.""
"
"jas 39c gripen durghatna bhayepachi, wimansthal keko lagi banda gariyo?","The correct answer is **A: wyawasayik udanharu**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Bobek was born in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia. It also states that he came to Partizan Belgrade in 1945. Thus, he must have played for a Zagreb team before joining Partizan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: unle partijanko lagi 1945 dekhi khelna suru gare:** The passage explicitly states he joined in 1945.
*   **C: unle partijanko lagi 1995samma khele:** The passage mentions he was voted the best player in Partizan's history in 1995, but it says he stayed with the club until 1958, not 1995.
*   **D: partijanko sarwashreshtha kheladi chuniyepachi unle prasiddhi kamaye:** The passage indicates he was already famous before being voted the best player. His impressive stats demonstrate this."

"anuchhed anusar, adhikariharu lai luno ko bare suruwati chinta ke thiyo?","The correct answer is **C: indhanko chuwahat**.

The paragraph states that ""suruma adhikariharu jahajle kehi bhar pokhna sakcha bhani daraye,"" which translates to ""initially, the authorities were worried that the ship might spill some cargo."" Since the ship had fuel, this implies the authorities were concerned about a fuel leak."
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey lunoko kharabibare kun kathan satya hoina?","The correct answer is **B: kharabi huda jahajma 100 metersko indhan thiyo**.

Here's why:

* **P** states that the ship had 120-160 cubic meters of fuel, *not* 100 meters of fuel. The 100 meters refers to the *length* of the ship.

The other options are true based on the passage:

*   **A**: ""100 mitterko jahaz afno samanya malko cargo linka lagi yatra gariraheko thiyo"". This means the ship was carrying cargo. It can be interpreted that damage to cargo happened.
*   **C**: ""Helicopterharule bahra chalak dalka sadasyaharulai uddhar gare ra ek matra chotpatak futeko naak thiyo.""
*   **D**: ""Luno tukrida yasama 120-160 ghanmeter indhan thiyo ra uccha aandhi ra chhalle yasalai bandhama dhakelyo."""

"
antyeshti samharoko lagi kaha television screenharu sthapana gariyeko thiyena?,"Correct answer is **D: cent peters square ma**

The passage states that ""sabailai cent peters squirema antyeshtima jaan sambhawa thiena"" (it wasn't possible for everyone to attend the funeral at St. Peter's Square). This implies that screens were not set up *in* St. Peter's Square, but in other locations to allow people to watch. The other options (Rome, Italy, Poland) are mentioned as places where screens *were* set up.
"
antyeshti samharo kaha gariyo?,"The correct answer is **C: cent peters square ma**

The passage states that due to the large number of people, not everyone could attend the funeral in Cent Peter's Square. This implies that the funeral ceremony itself was held in Cent Peter's Square. Options A, B, and D are incorrect as they refer to places where people watched the ceremony on screens, not the location of the ceremony itself.
"
"wisfotan bhae pachhi, gambhir chotpatakko lagi kaslai upachar gariyo?","The correct answer is **B: kaslai pani gariyena**.

The passage states ""Kasailai kunai thulo chotpatak lageko bhanera report garieko chhaina..."" which translates to ""No one was reported to have suffered any major injuries...""  While 5 people were treated for shock, the question asks about treatment for *serious injuries*.

Therefore the correct answer is **C: saat**
"

The passage states: ""Manawama ghatak bird flue roko prajati H5N1 ley sombar franceko purvama leone najikai marcellandma fella pareko ek mrit jungli haansalai sankramit gareko pushti bhaeko cha."" This directly translates to: ""A deadly bird flu variant H5N1 was confirmed on Monday to have infected a dead wild duck found in Marcelland near Leone in eastern France."" This means the most recent confirmed case mentioned in the passage was in France.
"

The passage states: ""Senako agaman hunuaghi, haitile sun 1800 co dashakpachhi yo rogsanga sambandhit samasyaharuko samana garnupareko thiena."" This translates to: ""Before the arrival of the army, Haiti had not faced problems related to this disease since the 1800s.""
"
kun sthanko phohorley rog sarnama yogdaan garyo?,"The correct answer is **B: sanyukta rashtra sanghko chaauni** (United Nations camp).

The text states that the disease was spread by UN peacekeepers who arrived after the 2010 earthquake and the disease started spreading from near their military camp. While the text mentions that the Haitian Justice and Democracy Institute references studies suggesting the Nepali UN peacekeepers brought the disease, the specific place linked to the outbreak is the UN camp. Therefore, the UN camp's waste is the most likely source of contamination contributing to the disease spread, as implied in the prompt.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: laghuausadh.
"
sankha gariyeko apradhilai keko lagi anusandhan garindai cha?,"The text states that Christopher Garcia is being investigated for committing a crime instead of preventing one. It also mentions someone altering the Hollywood sign, changing ""O"" to a lowercase ""e"" using a cloth, along with peace and heart symbols.

Based on this, the most accurate answer is **C: todfod**.  (""Vandalism"" in English). While unauthorized entry might be implied, the core of the described act is the defacing/vandalizing of property. The passage states specifically that ""chinhalai bhautik rupma kshati purryaieko thiena"" meaning ""the sign was not physically damaged."" But todfod refers to more than just physical damage; it includes defacement.
"
chinahalai parimarjan garda doshiley ke garena?,"The correct answer is **C: bhautik roopma kshati (physical damage)**.

The passage states ""Chinhalai bhautik rupma kshati purryaieko thiena;"" which translates to ""The sign was not physically damaged.""  The question asks what the perpetrator *didn't* do when altering the signs.
"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey keko lagi angreji shikshaklai dosh lagaena?","The passage states the following:

*   **Copyright infringement:** ""Pratilipi adhikar ullanghanko arop uhaanlai phile pani lagaieko cha tar mudda darta garieko thiena."" (Copyright infringement was accused, but no case was filed).
*   **Inappropriate language in class:** ""Uni kakshama ashlilta prayog garthe bhane suninchha."" (It is heard that he used obscenity in class.)
*   **False advertising:** ""Adhunik shikshale unimathi bina anumati basma thulla vigyapan chhapeko ra afu mukhya angrezi shikshak bhaeko bhandai jhuta boleko arop lagayo."" (Modern Education accused him of printing large advertisements in buses without permission and lying about being the chief English teacher.)
*   **Dating with students:** ""Ek purva vidyarthile uni...notema dettingka barema seep sikaunthe ra vidyarthiharuko saathi jastai thee."" (A former student said that he would teach skills about dating in notes and was like a friend to the students.)

The passage mentions that the English teacher was falsely accused of advertising without permission, as Modern Education printed ads about him without his consent.

Therefore, the answer is **C: bina anumati vigyapanharu chhapne**."
"anuchhed anusar, ronaldo mendozad le kaslai bandhakko rupma rakhenan?","The correct answer is **B: prahariharu (police)**.

The paragraph states:

*   Tourists were taken hostage.
*   Children were among the hostages.
*   Photographers were exchanged for an elderly hostage.

It doesn't mention police being taken hostage. Therefore, Ronaldo Mendoza did not hold police as hostages."

The text states: ""Andolankariharule novemberma national congressma dina 112 lakh hastaksharko nivedan sankalan gurney asha rakheka chan."" This translates to ""Activists are hoping to collect a petition with 1.12 million signatures to submit to the National Congress in November."" This clearly indicates that activists are the ones collecting signatures in support of something, which in this context is related to same-sex marriage.
"
andolankariharuley uniharuko nivedan kaslai dinchan?,"The passage states: ""Andolankariharule novemberma national congressma dina 112 lakh hastaksharko nivedan sankalan gurney asha rakheka chan."" This translates to ""The protesters hope to submit a petition with 1.12 million signatures to the National Congress in November.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: Brazilko national congress**

"Armand Bharsacheko anusar, bhidle mausamko pratikriya garna thik aghi ke bhayo?","The correct answer is **A: asina parna thalyo**.

1. Wind starts whirling.
2. Wind reaches 70 km/h.

4. **Hail falls**.
5. People panic and run.

Therefore, hail falling immediately precedes the crowd's reaction.

"Bharsache anusar, sabaibbanda baliyo aandhi kahiley suru bhayo?","The correct answer is **D: asina parnu aghi**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the sequence of events:

1. Wind starts swirling quickly.
2. Wind reaches 70 km/hr.
3. Rain falls, ""stinging like needles.""
4. Hail falls.
5. Panic and chaos ensue.

The most intense part of the storm, as described by Armand Bharsachele, begins right before the hail starts falling. The falling of hail is the action that causes the man to lose his party of people and to witness the horrible sight of the disabled in wheelchairs being overrun."

nimna madhey kunko tesko purvavartiharu bhanda druta gati cha?,"The passage states that 802.11n is faster than its predecessors, with a maximum theoretical throughput of up to 600 Mbit/s. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: 802.11n**
"
802.11nlai 802.11bsanga pachhadipatti sangat huna keko awashyakta chha?,"D: dohoro radioharu

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that 802.11n can be backward compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g ""if the base station has dual radios."" The other options are either characteristics of 802.11n itself (like the faster speed) or irrelevant to backward compatibility.
"
olympic swarna padak vijetaley rashtramandal khelkudma katiota pratiyogitaharuma paudi khelne thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: teen**.

The first sentence states: ""Olympic swarna padak vijetale 100 meter ra 200 meter freestyle ra rashtramandal khelkudma **teen** rilema paudi khelnu thiyo..."" (The Olympic gold medalist swam in 100 meter, 200 meter freestyle, and **three** relays at the Commonwealth Games...).
"
olympic swarna padak vijetaley afnp pidako lagi kina ausadhi khairaheko thiyena?,"The correct answer is **D: tesko prayog garna rashtramandal khelkudma anumati chaina** (Its use is not allowed in the Commonwealth Games).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Khelma pratibandha lagaieka karan uhaanle afno pidabata mukt hoon awashyak aushadhi lynn sakeka chhainan."" (Because of the ban in the sport, he has not been able to take the necessary medicine to relieve his pain.) This directly implies that the medicine is banned in the sport (Commonwealth Games in this case), preventing him from taking it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: usanga kunai pida thiyena** (He had no pain): The passage explicitly states he has pain (""afno pidabata mukt"").
* **B: tesle uuslai birami banauthiyo** (It would make him sick): The passage doesn't mention anything about the medicine causing illness.
* **C: tesle usko swasthatalai nakaratmak ruple asar garcha vanera chintit thiyo** (He was worried that it would negatively affect his health): While possible, the passage prioritizes the ban as the primary reason he couldn't take the medicine.
"
"anuchhed anusar, bhukampa gatiwidhaibare keley bhram srijana garna sakthyo?","The correct answer is **A: kalo badalko upasthiti (the presence of dark clouds)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Pahadko fedma kunai jwalamukhi gatiwidhisanga gadha badalharu report garieka thee. Badalle bhramaka lagi sambhawana prastut gare key katai wastawik bisfot bhaeko thiyo."" This translates to ""Thick clouds were reported at the foot of the mountain in conjunction with volcanic activity. The clouds presented the possibility of illusion that there might be a real explosion.""  Therefore, the clouds were the source of the illusion regarding earthquake activity.
"
"anuchhed anusar, charan parivartan kahile ghatyo?","The correct answer is **C: march 10 ma**.

The passage states: ""Charan parivartan garaune ullekhaniya bhukampa gatiwidhi march 10 maa jwalamukhiko shikhar calderaco uttari chheuma bhaeko thiyo.""

"
nimna kathanharu madhey kunley chandra jaanchlai sahi tarikale varnan garcha?,"The passage says the lunar probe carried three important scientific instruments, not two. It also doesn't mention anything about landing near the north pole, successful risky landing, or being ejected from a manned orbiter. However, the passage does mention that the probe carried an image of the Indian flag.

Therefore, none of the given options accurately describe the lunar probe based solely on the provided passage. However, based on general knowledge about lunar probes, none of the options are fully wrong but C is the closest correct answer. 

Here's why:

*   **A: tyo chandramako uttari dhruv najik awataran garyo:** The passage doesn't say this.
*   **B: tesko jokhimpurwak awataran safal thiyo:** The passage doesn't say this, and the passage says ""mrityu pani bhayo"" implying something went wrong.
*   **C: tyo euta manavyukta orbiterbata bahira fyakiyeko thiyo:** While not explicitly stated, lunar probes are often deployed from orbiters (either manned or unmanned). This is the *most likely* scenario.
*   **D: yesley duita mahatwapurna upakaranharu bokekoo thiyo:** The passage says *three* instruments.

Therefore, the best answer given the limited information is **C**."
"anuchhedko adharma, rog viruddha kun surakshako upaya antimma lagu hunecha?","The correct answer is **C: encephalitis khop**.

The passage states that the government has promised lakhs of encephalitis vaccines for children. Although other measures like insecticide spraying, pig catching, and mosquito net distribution are mentioned, the *vaccine* is the long-term preventative measure that will help health agencies prepare for the coming year.
"
rog manavma kasari sarcha?,"The correct answer is **A: lamkhutte**.

The passage states: ""Sungurharu yo roka wahak hunchhan ra tyasapachhi yo lamkhutte hundai manawama sarchha."" This translates to ""Pigs are carriers of this disease and then it spreads to humans via mosquitoes.""
"

This directly translates to: ""The failure of the second sentence, which proposed to ban same-sex civil unions, could potentially open the door for civil unions in the future.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: bhavishyako lagi samalingi nagarik union ko aadhikar** (Rights for same-sex civil unions in the future)
"
"anuchhed anusar, doshro wakya kahiley hataieko thiyo?","The correct answer is **A: vidhayakiya satrama**.

The passage states: ""Pratinidhimandalle dosro wakya metaepachhi vidhayakiya satrama parivartan gariyo..."" This translates to ""After the House of Representatives removed the second clause, there was a change in the legislative session...""

Therefore, the second clause was removed during the legislative session.
"
“panama papers” kaslai pradan garieko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: Press**.

The passage states that the Panama Papers were released to the press in the spring of 2016.
"
"anuchhed anusar, Britis patrikale kasle dhan lukauna dherai companyharu vyawasthapan gardai thiyo vanera daabi garyo?","Correct answer is **C: duech bank**.

The passage clearly states: ""Britisha patrika da garzianka anusar yo karya garnaka lagi prayog garieka 1200 vata sell companyharumadhye ek tihai companyharu duech bankko niyantranma thee."" This translates to: ""According to the British newspaper The Guardian, one-third of the 1200 shell companies used for this operation were under the control of Deutsche Bank."" Therefore, Deutsche Bank managed a significant portion of the companies involved in hiding wealth.
"
nimna vimaan durghatanaharu madhey kunma sabaibhanda badhi mrityu vayo?,"The correct answer is **A: iranbata armenia jaandai gareko vimaan durghatana**.

The text mentions that 168 people died in the plane crash going to Armenia from Iran. The other options have significantly fewer fatalities:

*   Police helicopter crash: 3 deaths
*   Mashhad plane accident: 17 deaths

The passage doesn't mention any plane crash from Armenia to Iran.

nimna madhey kun vishaya iraq study groupko reportma smawesh chaina?,"The correct answer is **B: ek ghoshana ki kunai wisesh parivartanharusangai, iraqma himsako bridhi tarna sakinna** (an announcement that no particular changes can stem the growth of violence in Iraq).

Here's why:

*   **A: haalko nitiko alochana** (criticism of the current policy) - The passage clearly states, ""Yo pratiwedanma karyakarile irakprati lieko wartaman nitiko lagbhag sabai pakshako alochana garieko cha"" (The report criticizes almost all aspects of the current policy adopted by the executives towards Iraq).
*   **C: iraqko simanaharu surakshit garnako lagi sifaris** (recommendation to secure Iraq's borders) - The passage states, ""Yasaka 78 sifarisharumadhye pahilo yo ho key pratirodhi hastakshepharuko viruddha irakko simana surakshit garna..."" (The first of its 78 recommendations is to secure Iraq's border against resistant interventions...)
*   **D: samyukta rajya america ko sarwasammatiko lagi anurodh** (request for consensus from the United States) - The passage states, ""Yo pratiwedan madhya purwako nitika barema sanyukta rajya americama khulla bahas ra sahamati gathan garnaka lagi anurodh garna khulyo"" (The report opened to request an open debate and consensus building in the United States on Middle East policy).
*   **B** is the correct answer because the Iraq Study Group doesn't state that violence can't be stemmed. It warns that *no one can guarantee* that any specific action will prevent a slide into sectarian war, increased violence, or anarchy. This is a warning about uncertainty, not a definitive statement that nothing can work.

"

This translates to: ""According to the guard, Low Piccolo was considered the top hand because he was the right-hand man of Provenzano in Palermo...""

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: lo piccolo**.

The paragraph states: ""Yadi swikrit bhaema **ayuktale jamanat tokchhan** ra pakrau gurney adhikarile darta gareko aroplai aupacharik banaunchhan."" This translates to ""If approved, the **commissioner sets bail** and the arresting officer formalizes the charges filed.""

Anuchhed anusaar raddha garieko runoff laai vyaakhya garnu kun kaaran prayog garieko thiena?,"The correct answer is **D: Samwaidhanik aspashtata**

The passage states, ""Kutnitigyaharule afaganistanko sanvidhanma anawashyak rupma apharan nirdharit garna paryapta aspashtata fella pare bhane."" This translates to: ""Diplomats pointed out enough ambiguity in the Afghan constitution to unnecessarily determine a runoff."" This directly addresses the reason for potentially cancelling the runoff election: constitutional ambiguity.
"
Kutnitigyaharule antata kina runoff laai anawashyak thaane?,"The passage says, ""Kutnitigyaharule afaganistanko sanvidhanma anawashyak rupma apharan nirdharit garna paryapta aspashtata fella pare bhane."" This translates to: ""Diplomats found enough ambiguity in the Afghan constitution to unnecessarily define a runoff.""

This directly supports option C, which is that there was ambiguity in the constitution.

The other options are mentioned as reasons officials canceled the election, but the question specifically asks why diplomats considered the runoff unnecessary.

Therefore, the correct answer is C.
"

Emma Stone le kun awardko laagi manonayan prapta garinn?,"Correct answer: C: sarvotkrishta abhinetri

The passage states: ""Gosling ra stonele kramashah sarwashreshtha abhineta ra abhinetrika lagi namangkan prapta gare."" (Gosling and Stone received nominations for Best Actor and Best Actress respectively.) This indicates she *did* get a nomination for Best Actress. Since the question asks for what she *didn't* get nominated for, and the passage doesn't mention any of the other options, and we *know* she got nominated for best actress, and thus option C is not the answer. We are looking for an answer that the passage makes no mention of to suggest it wasn't nominated. This narrows our answer down to A: sarvotkrishta sahaabhinetri or B: sarvotkrishta nirdeshak or D: sarvotkrishta film sampadan.
Looking at the other nominations mentioned in the passage, we see ""film sampadan"" (film editing), meaning D has been nominated.
This only leaves A or B.
Since the passage is about acting roles in the movie, Emma Stone would most likely be a lead role, so the passage most likely wouldn't mention she was nominated as ""sahabhinetri"" or ""supporting actress"".

Therefore, the best answer is **A: sarvotkrishta sahaabhinetri** (Best Supporting Actress).

*   The passage states: ""Nigatako Kashiwajaki kariwa anawik urja kendra samanya rupma sanchalan bhairaheko cha..."" which translates to ""The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant in Niigata is operating normally..."".
*   The passage also mentions the Shika nuclear power plant's reactors 1 and 2 were shut down.
*   The Ishikawa airport is still closed and the railway services are disrupted."

Here's why:

*   **A: Jerusalem ko bhavishya:** The passage explicitly mentions ""dubaika lagi pavitra Jerusalemko bhawishyako awastha"" (the future status of holy Jerusalem for both).
*   **C: Upatyaka maa sainik upasthiti:** The passage details the dispute over military presence in the Jordan Valley (""jorden bhyaliko mudda"").
*   **D: Simaana maathi kaa vivadharu:** The first sentence directly mentions ""kagajatle sima vivadlai janaunechha"" (the papers will address border disputes).
*   **B: 1967 ko yuddha ko kaaran:** While the passage mentions the 1967 Middle East war as a reference point for borders, it *doesn't* discuss the reasons or causes of that war.

"Anuchhed anusar, kun deshle wakalat gareka kaaran Ma le nirvachan jitna safal bhayin?","The correct answer is **D: China**.

The paragraph states that Ma advocated for close ties with mainland China (""chiniyan mukhya bhumisanga ghanishta sambandhako wakalat gardai""), and effectively won the election (""platform dakshatapurwak jit hasil gare"") because of it.
"
"Anuchhed maa ullekh gariye anusar, Carolyn Wilson le sahar janu pahile kaska laagi kaam garin?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**.

The paragraph states that Lockwood Garden tenants believe they were swindled by Caroline Wilson of OHA, who then fled the city. This clearly indicates she worked for OHA before leaving town."
"Season maa char race haru baaki huda, Drivers’ Championship ko chautho sthan maa ko chha?","Answer: D: Bowyer

Explanation:
The passage states: ""Tesroma, hamlin bees ankle pachadi ra boyarbhanda paanch ankle aghadi raheko cha."" This means Hamlin is 20 points behind the leader and 5 points behind Bowyer. Therefore, Bowyer is ahead of Hamlin, meaning he is in a higher position. We also know Hamlin is in third. Given that Bowyer is ahead of Hamlin, he is in fourth place.
"
"Anuchhed maa ullekh gariyeko race anusar, Drivers’ Championship maa Kahne ko kati angka raheko chha?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The passage states: ""Kahne ra Truex, Junior 2,220 ra 2,207 ankaka sath kramashah pachaun ra chhaithaun sthanma chan."" This directly translates to Kahne having 2,220 points.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, kati patak manis harule awalokan gareko ulka pinda haru pachhi mangal graha maa utpatti bhaeko pramanit bhaeka chan?","The correct answer is **B: Paanch patak**

The passage states: ""Yo manincha key itihasma panchaun patak manisharule awalokan gare key rasayanik ruple pushti bhaeko mangal grahako padartha prithvima khasiraheko thiyo."" which translates to ""It is believed that for the fifth time in history, humans observed chemically confirmed material from Mars falling to Earth.""
"
"Anuchhed maa ullekh bhaye anusar, mangal graha maa utpatti bhaeka chattan baare kun kura sacho ho?","The correct answer is **D: Tyaha 34 vata chan** (There are 34 of them).

Here's why:

*   The passage clearly states: ""Prithvima khaseko bhanera thaha bhaeka karib 24,000 vata ulka pindamadhye kewal 34 vata matri mangal grahabata aeko pushti bhaeko cha."" This translates to ""Out of approximately 24,000 meteorites known to have fallen to Earth, only 34 have been confirmed to have originated from Mars.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sabai July maa bhaeko ulka barsha maa bhetiyeka thiye** (All were found in the July meteor shower): The passage states that fifteen of the rocks are credited to the meteor shower last July, not all 34.
*   **B: Tyaha 24,000 wata thiye** (There were 24,000 of them): The passage mentions 24,000 meteorites fell to earth. Only 34 were confirmed to originate from Mars.
*   **C: Tinko mulya sun bhanda 11,000 americi dollar badhi chha** (Their value is 11,000 US dollars more than gold): The passage says that their cost can be between 11,000 and 22,500 US dollars per ounce. It is also stated that that amount is more than 10 times the cost of gold. Therefore, this option is incorrect."
Schumacher le kahile sanyas liye?,"Correct answer is: **B: Unko saatau championship**

The text states: ""Sumakar jo 2006 maa saat patak formula 1 championship jitepachhi sewa niwritta bhae..."" which translates to ""Schumacher, who retired in 2006 after winning the Formula 1 championship seven times...""

Therefore, Schumacher retired after winning his seventh championship.
"
Massa kahile ghaaite bhaye?,"Correct answer is **A: Grand Prix ko dauran maa**

The passage states ""Sun 2009 ko hangeri grand priksko belama brazily manisko taukoma gambhir chotpatak lagyo."" This clearly indicates the injury occurred during a Grand Prix.

(The number of Yahoo! users and Microsoft services will collectively compete with the number of AOL's customers.) This directly implies that Yahoo and Microsoft users will challenge the number of AOL users, making option C the correct answer.

"Florida maa jitne le sabai rajya paune hunale, Mitt romni lai ke pradan gariyo?","Correct answer is C: Rajya kaa sabai pratinidhi.

The passage states, ""Vijetale sabai rajya paune hunale, floridale afna pachas jana pratinidhiharulai Romneyley puraskrit garyo..."" which translates to ""Because the winner gets all the state, Florida awarded its fifty delegates to Romney..."". Therefore, Romney was awarded all the state's representatives, which is option C.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, Gingrich le praathamik nirwachan maa kati pratishat vote prapta gare?","The correct answer is **B: 32 pratishat**.

The passage states ""Sadanka purva americi adhyaksha Newt Jingrich 32 pratishat prapta garera dosro sthanma ae."" (Former US Speaker Newt Gingrich came in second place with 32 percent).
"
"Anuchhed anusar, caucus ko natija pachhi kasle daud lai nirantarta dienan?","The correct answer is **B: Bachman**.

The passage states: ""Augustma aims stra jiteki backmanle afno abhiyan antya gurney nirnaya garin."" This translates to ""Bachman, who won the Ames straw poll in August, decided to end her campaign."" This indicates that after the caucus results (which are implied to have happened after August), she did not continue the race.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Gingrich:** He is mentioned as praising Santorum and criticizing Romney after the results, which implies he continued.
*   **Peri:** He stated he would evaluate if he had a path forward but later announced he would continue and compete in the South Carolina primary, so he continued at least for a while.
*   **Romney:** He is criticized by Gingrich, implying he was still in the race."
"Anuchhed anusar, caucus ko natija pachhi kasle arko umwedwaar ko prashansa gare?","The passage states: ""Natija aepachhi, jingrichle santoramko prashansa gareka thee..."" This translates to ""After the result, Gingrich praised Santorum...""

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Gingrich**.
"
2015 agadi karyakram pradarshan garieko ek matra thaau kun thiyo?,"The correct answer is **A: TogiNet Radio**.

The passage states that the show was ""only available on internet radio site TogiNet Radio"" in its early days.
"
Station le karyakram le kasto spin bhaeko warnan garchha?,"Prasnama, yo ullekh gariyeko chha ki ""naya ra apamanjanak gricky spin"" ko sath purano vidyalaya radio theatre. Yashlai dhyanma rakhda, sahi uttar **C: Purano** hunchha."
David Headley le antata ke prapta gare jasle ladaku samuhako akraman lai sahayog garyo?,"The passage states ""David Headleyko scouting ra jankari sankalanle pakistani sainya samuha laskhar-ae-taibabata 10 banduksahitka manisdwara aparesanlai saksham banauna maddat gareko thiyo."" This translates to ""David Headley's scouting and **information gathering** helped the Pakistani military group Lashkar-e-Taiba to enable the operation by 10 armed men.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Suchana (Information)**.
"
Mumbai pugna ladaku samuhale kun yaatayaat ko saadhan ko prayog gare?,"The correct answer is **C: Dungaa**.

The passage clearly states ""november 26, 2008 maa dungabata aipugeka thee"" which translates to ""they arrived by boat on November 26, 2008.""
"
Kun wakya le Nadal ra Raonic ko Brisbane Open match ko natija lai sahi rupma pratibimbit garchha?,"Sahi uttar ho: A: Raonic le Nadal lai haraaye

P quoted bhayeko text anusar, Nadalle bharkhar Brisbane Open ma Raonic viruddha paraajay bhogeka thie. Teskarana, A sahi uttar ho."
"Anuchhed anusar, pahilo serve pachhi Nadal ra Raonic ko match ko kun sthan thiyo?","Correct answer is: **B: Nadal le 76 anka prapta gare**

The passage states, ""Khelma Nadalle 88% cool anka prapta gareka thee jasma unle pahilo sarbhamai 76% anka prapta gareka thee."" This translates to ""In the game, Nadal achieved 88% cool points, in which he achieved 76% points on the first serve.""
"
Teen naya Naked News prasaran maa kun bhasa ko karyakram samaawesh garieko chhaina?,"The correct answer is **C: Japanese**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Naked News already reports in English and Japanese.
*   It also states that they are adding Spanish, Italian, and Korean programming.
*   Therefore, Japanese is the only language listed that isn't a *new* addition."
"Anuchhed anusar, naya Naked News ko prashaasaran kaha uplabdha hune chhainan?","Paragraphma cinema ghar baarek kahi pani ullekh chhaina. Tara, mobile upakaran, internet ra television sabai mentioned chan.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Cinema ghar**
"
Giant Slalom lai kati jana pratishpardhi le sampanna garenan?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

The passage states: ""giant slalomma 117 cool skier madhye 45 ley daudama shreni pauna sakenan"". This directly translates to ""In the giant slalom, out of 117 cool skiers, 45 were unable to get a ranking in the race"". Therefore, 45 competitors did not finish the Giant Slalom.
"
Yea madhye kun wakya le Championship ko race ko natija lai sahirup maa pratibimbit garchhan?,"Correct answer is **B: 45 skier harule Giant Slalom maa aafno daud sampanna garenan**

Here's why:

*   **A: Dosro race maa Carpanedole Hungary ko skier aghi sampanna gare:** The information suggests Carpanedole finished 10th (with a Hungarian skier finishing 9th), meaning the Hungarian skier finished ahead of Carpanedole. So this is correct.
*   **B: 45 skier harule Giant Slalom maa aafno daud sampanna garenan:** The text explicitly states ""giant slalomma 117 cool skier madhye 45 ley daudama shreni pauna sakenan"". Which means 45 skiers could not finish the race. So this is also correct.
*   **C: Slalom bhanda dherai skier harule Giant Slalom sampanna gare:** There is no information that states this to be accurate.
*   **D: Carpenado le Slalom maa dashau sthan maa sampta gare:** The text mentions Carpanedole finishing 10th in the second race (joint Slalom) with additional data relating to race results. It does not mention her placing 10th in the first Slalom race. This information is therefore not included.

The question asks ""Which of the following sentences accurately reflects the results of the Championship race?"", therefore, the correct answer is **B** as it accurately reflects the text provided."
Yea madhye NBA le ke sthagit garne nirnaya garyo?,"The correct answer is **A: Basketball season**.

The passage states that the NBA suspended its professional basketball season due to concerns related to COVID-19.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, ke kaaran le virus ko baarema NBA ko chaso nimtyayo?","Correct answer: **D: Utah jazz ko euta kheladi sangkramit bhae**

The passage explicitly states that the NBA's decision came after a Utah Jazz player tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.
"

"
Capitals ra thrasaers ko khelma kasle season ko 60au goal gare?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

The passage clearly states that Ovechkin scored his 60th goal of the season in that game.
"
Northern rock bank lai sarkar baata kahile sahayata awashyak bhayo?,"The correct answer is **D: Dhito sankat ko belama**.

The passage states: ""Nardan raklai sun 2007 maa subprime dhito sankatka samayama yasako exposureka karan samarthan awashyak pareko thiyo."" This directly translates to ""Northern Rock needed support in 2007 during the subprime mortgage crisis due to its exposure.""
"
"Anuchhed anusar, yea madhye kun wakya le northern rock bank sanga samuha ko kaarobar lai sahi rupmaa vyaakhya garchha?","The correct answer is **B: Bharjin samuha le raashtriyakaran pachhi bank kharid garyo**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Richard Branson's Virgin Group's bid for the bank was rejected *before* nationalization.
* It also explicitly says that Virgin bought the ""good bank"" after nationalization, which was the *high street bank*, not the asset management company.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bharjin samuha le northern rock ko sampati wyawasthapan compani pani kharid garyo** The passage states, ""Virginle uttari chattanko """"ramro bank"""" kharid gareko cha, sampatti wyawasthapan company hoina."" this says that virgin did not kharid the asset management company
*   **C: Dhito sangkat ko belaama, Bharjin samuha le bank lai aapatkaalin sahaayata garne prastaav garyo** The passage says that Nardharna rock bankle belayat sarkarbata apatkalin sahayata paeko thiyo. this states the bank received emergency assistance from the belayat sarkarbata
*   **D: Bank ko laagi Bharjin samuha ko pahilo boli rashtriyakaran pachhi raakhiyo** The passage states, ""Bankko rashtriyakaran hunuaghi richard bransonko bharjin samuhale bankaka lagi lagaeko boli aswikrit bhaeko  thiyo."" this says that a bid was put in before nationalization.

Therefore, option B is the only one that accurately reflects the information in the passage."
"Anuchhed maa ullekh bhae anusar, kyoto mausam samjhauta maa hastantaran garnaale kun muluk lai asar garyo?","Correct answer is **A: Sanyukta rajya america**.

The passage explicitly states that the decision of a developed country that did not ratify and refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol keeps the United States away. While Australia, India, and China are mentioned, the specific impact of the refusal to sign/ratify is directly linked to the United States in the passage.
"
Australia ko purva sarkar le kyoto ko anumodan le kaslai noksan garne batayo?,"Correct Answer: B: Muluko arthatantra

**Explanation:**

The text states: ""Australiako purva rudhiwadi sarkarle kyoto samjhautako anumodan garna aswikar gardai...koilako niryatma thulo nirbhartale arthawyawasthalai noksan purryaunchha bhane.""

This translates to: ""Australia's former conservative government refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol...saying a large dependence on coal exports would harm the country's economy.""

Therefore, the former Australian government believed that ratifying the Kyoto Protocol would harm the *country's economy*.
"
Trail maa shooter harulai kun karyakramko laagi bharti garieko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Sporting shooter sangh ko shikaar karyakram**.

The passage states that ""sporting shooters association ko shikar karyakram antargat yogya swayamsewakharu bharti garie"" which translates to ""eligible volunteers were recruited under the hunting program of the sporting shooters association.""
"

Vastabma, yo trialma shooter haruko najikabaat nirikshan gariyo ra pahilo shooting sanchalanka lagi char shooter chunieko kura ullekh gariyeko chha.

Tesaile sahi jawab chha **A: Yo karyakram ko pahilo trial bhaeko le, yasko mulyankan bahena**.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, vibhajan kaha bhetiyo?","D is the best answer.

The passage says: ""Yass jiwashmako adharma, yasako matlab vibhajan anawik pramanle anuman garebhanda dherai pahileko ho."" and then Ethopian Rift Valley research is mentioned. This implies that the division is found/being discussed in relation to Ethiopia.

While the Rift Valley is mentioned, the focus is on the research service being *in* Ethiopia. The fossils and molecular evidence are being used to *understand* the division, not *where* the division itself is.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, apekshya gare bhanda aghi ke bhayo?","The correct answer is **B: Vibhajan**.

The passage states: ""Yass jiwashmako adharma, yasako matlab vibhajan anawik pramanle anuman garebhanda dherai pahileko ho.""  This translates to ""This fossil discovery means the split happened much earlier than estimated by molecular evidence."" Therefore, the split (vibhajan) happened earlier than expected.
"
Video game maa chal niyantran garna kheladi le ke garnu parchha?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: Controller laai hawama chalaunuhos (Controller laai hawama chalaunuhos)**.

The text states that: ""kheladiharu bhidiyo gemka axone ra chalharu yo yantralai hawa yatauta chalaera niyantran garna sakchhan."" This translates to: ""Players can control the actions and movements in the video game by moving this device (controller) in the air.""
"
Television remote jasto dekhina ke design garieko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: Nintendo Revolution controller**.

The passage states: ""Television remotma pune: sanyojan gardai, niyantran gurney controller..."" meaning ""Resembling a television remote, the controlling controller..."". So the Nintendo Revolution controller is what looks like a television remote.
"
Xinhua samachar agency ko pachhillo report maa kun kura ullekh garieko thiena?,"The correct answer is **B: Plane urumaqi ma avataran bhayo**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Plane le bomb ko dhamki paeko thiyo:** The passage states, ""Pratiwedanle pachhi gaera yo kura batayo key vimanle bamko dhamki paeko thiyo."" (The report later stated that the plane received a bomb threat.)
*   **C: Plane Afghanistan tarfa pathaiyo:** The passage mentions ""...afghanistan firta pathaieko thiyo."" (...it was sent back to Afghanistan.)
*   **D: Plane kandahar ma avataran bhayo:** The passage states ""...kandaharma awataran gurney gari..."" (...to land in Kandahar...).
*   **B: Plane urumaqi ma avataran bhayo:** The passage says ""Prarambhik pratiwedanle urumkima apatkalin awataran aswikar bhaepachi vimanlai afghanistan farkaiyo bhanera bataunchha."" (The initial report states that the plane was returned to Afghanistan after an emergency landing in Urumqi was refused.) This means it didn't land in Urumqi.

Therefore, the pachhillo (latest) report from Xinhua did NOT mention that the plane landed in Urumqi."
Xinhua samachar agency ko suru ko report ma ke ullekhit garieko thiena?,"Sahi uttar D ho.

Yasabhanda phile chiniyan samachar agency Xinhualey euta vimaan hijack bhaeko khabar gare. Prarambhik pratiwedanle urumkima apatkalin awataran aswikar bhaepachi vimanlai afghanistan farkaiyo bhanera bataunchha.

Option D: Plane le bomb ko dhamki paeko thiyo bhanne kura suru ko report ma ullekhit thiena. Yo kura pachi ko pratiwedan ma matra bataieko thiyo."
Radio karyakram maa Sara Danius le ke ghoshana garin?,"The correct answer is **D: Samiti le Dealan sanga samparka garne karya banda garne cha**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bob Dealanlai sahityama 2016 ko nobel puraskar paune barema sidhai pugna asamartha bhaekale samitile uhansamma pugna afna prayasharu tyagidiyo."" This directly translates to: ""Because Bob Dylan was unable to be reached directly regarding winning the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature, the committee gave up its efforts to reach him."" This means the committee stopped trying to contact Dylan.
"
Ko sanga sambarka bhaena?,"The passage states that the committee could not reach Bob Dylan directly: ""Bob Dealanlai sahityama 2016 ko nobel puraskar paune barema sidhai pugna asamartha bhaekale samitile uhansamma pugna afna prayasharu tyagidiyo.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Bob Dealan**.
"
Kasle pratibadhata laai “ek pramukh kadam” bhaeko tipani garnu bhayo?,"The answer is **C: Gordon Johndroe**.

The text states that Bush's former spokesman, Gordon Johndroe, called the commitment ""an important step towards achieving verifiable denuclearization on the Korean peninsula.""
"
Slania le vibhinna muluk haruka lagi kati tikat utpadan gare?,"The text states, ""Unle sweden ra 28 any deshharuka lagi 1,000bhanda badhi tikatharu utpadan gareka thee.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: 1,000 mathi**.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, tanky vent bata ninrantar chuhawat hune sambhawat kaaran ke ho?","The correct answer is **C: Thermal wista**.

The passage states: ""Budhbar d,tankyka nikasharu sambhawat tanky bhitrako thermal wistarbata ajhai pani chuhine nai thee."" This directly indicates that thermal expansion within the tank is the likely cause of the continued leakage.
"
Relief valve haru kina khule?,"The correct answer is **B: Pranaliko parikshan pachhi power failure bhaeko thiyo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the relief valve opened and the crude oil overflowed *after* a power failure occurred following a routine fire-command system test.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A:** While thermal expansion is mentioned, it's stated as a reason for ongoing leaks *after* the initial incident, not the cause of the relief valve opening.
*   **C:** The passage states the tanks could hold 55,000 barrels and the oil flowed into it. It does not state the tanks were full.
*   **D:** The passage says that the secondary containment area was *not* at its full capacity, making this incorrect."
Haal ninth waad maa pani kati mathi cha?,"The correct answer is **C: kammarsamma**

The passage states ""Nawaun ward, jahaan toofan Katrinaka bela 20 feet samma uchai bhaeko badhi aeko thiyo, ahile najikaiko baandhalai paar garekale **kammarsammako panima cha**."" (Ninth Ward, where the flood reached up to 20 feet during Hurricane Katrina, is now in water up to **waist-level** because a nearby dam was breached.)
"
Katrina toofan ko belama ninth ward maa ke ghatana bhayo?,"The correct answer is **C: badhi ko pani 20 feet mathi thiyo** (badhi ko pani 20 feet mathi thiyo).

The original text states that in the Ninth Ward during Hurricane Katrina, the flood waters rose to a height of 20 feet. The translation of option C is ""flood water was more than 20 feet"".
"
tala ullekh garie madhye kun chahi Hamilton le pushti garenan?,"The passage states that Hamilton confirmed the patient is in stable condition at the hospital.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Jaha virami le bhraman gareka thie (Where the patient traveled):** The passage mentions the patient traveled to Nigeria. So, this WAS confirmed.
*   **B: Aru virami virus ko samparka maa aune sambhavana (The possibility of other patients coming into contact with the virus):** The passage mentions isolating the patient to prevent potential spread, implying concern about this. So, this WAS addressed.
*   **C: Yadi awayask protocol ko palana garieko thiyo (If the established protocols were followed):** The passage explicitly states that the hospital *is* following infection control protocols. So this WAS confirmed.
*   **D: Birami ko bartaman awastha (The current condition of the patient):** The passage confirms the patient is in a stable condition. So this WAS confirmed.

**Therefore, none of the options listed were NOT confirmed. However, Option C is the BEST answer, as the statement is formed as a question ""If the established protocols were followed?"" while the passage clearly states that the protocols ARE being followed.**"
Vaigyanik haru ke patta lagauna chanchan?,"The correct answer is **D: Prithvi kasari banyo**.

The passage states that scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed, by studying comets colliding with Earth.  The other options are less directly related to the main point.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, banda garaunu maa sthaniya prahari le ke bhumika khele?","The correct answer is **C: Uniiharu le sawari chalak lai arko bato tarfa nirdeshit gare** (They directed drivers to the alternate route).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""...80 prahariko maddat motorcycle yatriharulai ghumauro bato turf nirdeshit garnaka lagi tayar thiyo."" This directly translates to ""80 police officers were ready to direct motorcycle travelers to the detour route.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Uniiharu le FB banda garna agraha gare** (They requested the FBI to close it): The passage clearly states the Maryland Transportation Authority closed it *at the request of the FBI*, not the local police.
* **B: Uniiharu le banda garne nirnaya gare** (They made the decision to close it):  The decision was made by the Maryland Transportation Authority, based on the FBI's request.
* **D: Uniiharu le vaikalpik bato ma yatayat dhillai report gare** (They reported traffic delays on the alternate route): The passage says no major traffic delays were reported on the beltway.

Therefore, option C accurately reflects the role of the local police as described in the passage.
"
Banda ko samay ma tube pravesh dwaar lai ke bhayo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti banda gariye**.

The passage states: ""Tipperharu tube praeshdwarharu roknaka lagi prayog garieka thee"" (Tippers were used to block the tube entrances). This means the tube entrances were closed.
"
"Anucched anusar, photographer laai gaaadi le hirkaunu aghi ke bhaeko thiena?","Correct answer is **D: Photographer le Bieber ko photo khichna safal bhae.**

The paragraph states that TMZ understood that the photographer was trying to take pictures of a police stop before crossing the road. It doesn't say anything about the photographer successfully taking Bieber's photo. The other options are events described in the paragraph as happening before the accident.
"
Photographer laai gadi le hirkaaunu aghi ke garne prayas gardai thie?,"The correct answer is **B: Prahari stop ko photo lina**

The text states that the photographer ""roke ra sadak paar garnuaghi ra police stopko taswira khichne prayas gare"" - meaning he stopped and before crossing the road, tried to take a picture of a police stop.
"
Yea madhye kun wakya le virus sankraman pachhi rashtrapati ko avastha sahi ruple bataudaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Unlaai sancho mahasush bhaeko chaina**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...maha dursanchar garera afno cam pura garnaka lagi **swastha mahasus garchhu ra ramro awasthama chu.**"" This directly contradicts the statement that he is not feeling well.

The other options are all supported by the passage:

* **B: Unko galaa avarudda chha (Unko ghati dukheko chha):** The passage states ""Jwaro ra **ghati dukhaika** bahek...""
* **C: Unko awastha sthir chha:** The passage states ""Rashtrapatiko awastha **sthira** bhae pani...""
* **D: Unlaai Jwaro aaeko chha:** The passage states "" **Jwaro** ra ghati dukhaika bahek...""
"
"Anuchhed anusar, tala dieko madhye rashtrapati ko baare kun wakya sahi ho?","The correct answer is **C: Unii dursanchhar garna sakne awastha maa chhan**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""maha dursanchar garera afno cam pura garnaka lagi swastha mahasus garchhu ra ramro awasthama chu."" (I feel healthy and well enough to complete my work through telecommunications/telecommuting). This directly supports option C.
*   Option A is incorrect because the passage states ""Jwaro ra ghati dukhaika bahek..."" (Except for fever and sore throat...).
*   Option B is incorrect because the passage states, ""maha sombarsammama afna sabai kartawyaharuma farkane asha garchhu"" (I expect to return to all my duties by next Monday).
*   Option D is incorrect because the passage mentions ""halka sankramanko sakaratmak parikshan"" (positive test for a mild infection), indicating it's not a severe case."
"Anuchhed anusar, tropical cyclone gonu kahile kamjor hune apeksha garieko chha?","Sahi Uttar **B: Jaba hawa ko gati 83 kilometer prati ghanta maa jharyo**.

Anuchhedma spashtharuple ullekh gariएको chha ki ""ajko suruma, hawa 83 kimmy prati ghantako waripari thiyo ra yo kamjor rahirahane apeksha garieko thiyo."" Yasakole, jaba hawa ko gati 83 kimmy prati ghanta maa jharyo, tabe yo kamjor rahirahane apeksha garieko thiyo.
"
Tropical cyclone gonu charam bindu maa pugdaa hawa ko gati kati dherai thiyo?,"The correct answer is **C: 149 mile prati ghanta**.

The passage states that Tropical Cyclone Gonu reached a sustained wind speed of ""240 kilometer prati ghanta (149 mile prati ghanta)"". The question asks for the wind speed at its peak, which is 149 miles per hour."
Yea madhye kun chaahi karenia brevis ko viseshta maani daina?,"Correct answer: **C: Yo bahukoshiya ho** (It is multicellular)

**Explanation:**

The passage states: ""Prakritik rupma hune **ekal koshikayukta** samudri jiwale hune rato chaal..."" which means ""Red tide is caused by a naturally occurring **single-celled** marine organism..."". This directly contradicts option C, which says that *Karenia brevis* is multicellular. Therefore, C is NOT a characteristic of *Karenia brevis* and is the correct answer.

The other options are supported by the passage:

*   **A: Yo ek prakaar ko leu ho** (It is a type of algae): The passage implies this.
*   **B: Yasle manisko nashaa banda garna sakchha:** The passage mentions that it produces neurotoxins that can damage the nerves of humans and fish, it is a characteristic.
*   **D: Yo praakritik rupmai paahinchha** (It occurs naturally): The passage explicitly states ""Prakritik rupma hune..."" which means ""naturally occurring...""."
Tala die madhyeh karena brevis ke garna asamartha chha?,"Prashna anusar, carenia brevisle ke garna asamartha chha bhanne sodheko chha. Deko vivaran anusar:

"Anuchhed anusar, tala diekaa madhye kun ghatana felicia aandhi ko karan bhaeko hoina?","Correct answer: **D: Bato maa badhi aaunu**

Explanation: The paragraph mentions that the remnants of the storm produced rain in most islands, but there were **no reports of damage or flooding** (""kunai kshati wa badhiko report garieko chhaina"").  While the paragraph mentions beneficial rain, thunderstorms, and lightning, it specifically states there were no reports of flooding.
"
Felicia aandhi baare galat wakya kun ho?,"The correct answer is **B: Yaslai shreni 4 ko aandhi maanu aghi ushna pradeshiya sankuchan ko rupmaa vargikaran garieko thiyo.**

Here's why:

*   **P** states that ""Safir-simpson aandhi mapanma ek patak shreni 4 aandhi, felicia mangalwarka dina wighatan hunubhanda aghadi **ushna pradeshiya sankuchan hunale kamjor bhayo**"" which translates to ""Once a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, Felicia weakened due to **tropical depression** before dissipating on Tuesday""
*   This indicates that Felicia was first a Category 4 hurricane and then weakened into a tropical depression before dissipating. So it did not get classified as a tropical depression *before* being considered a Category 4 hurricane."
Tala dieko madhye kun wakya le 2009 ko Hungarian Grand Prix ko natija lai sahi rupmaa pratibimbit garchha?,"Sahi uttar **C: Piquet Jr. laai pachhi barkhasta gariyo** ho.

Di'eko paragraph le bhanirahako chha ki Piquet Jr. laai 2009 ko Hungarian Grand Prix pachi barkhasta gariyo. Teo ghatnale tyas grand prix ko natijaa lai sidhai pratibimbit garchha. Anyaa vikalp harule tyas ghatnaa ko barema bhanirahako chaina."
Durghatana kahile bhaeko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **A: Alonso ko pit stop lagattai** (Alonso's pit stop immediately).

The passage states that Alonso won because the cars ahead of him entered the pits for fuel *under the safety car*. The text doesn't directly state the accident happened at the same time or after the pitstops, but it does strongly infer that Piquet's crash and Alonso's pit stop were related, with Alonso benefitting from the circumstances that followed the accident. Therefore, pit stop lagattai (immediately after pit stop) is the most logical.

"Anuchhed anusar, tala diekaa madhye kaslai anweshak le vishwaas gare bhandaa kam samaya laagyo?","The answer is **A: Prajati haru ko nirman (Species formation)**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that researchers believed species formation through interbreeding between Darwin's Finch and Siudi Finch would take a long time.
*   However, the study reported that new species developed in only two generations.
*   Therefore, species formation took less time than the researchers had believed."
Tala dieko madhye kun anweshak haru report garenan?,"Saaransh anusar, anweshakharule naya prajati kaha nirman bhaeko, bikaas prakriyaa ko awadhi, ra prajanan maa samlagna bhaekaa chara bare report gare. Tiniharule naya prajati ko naam report gareko chainan.

Hence, the correct answer is:

**C: Naya prajati ko naam**
"
Cowparade kaha aayojana hune chha?,"The correct answer is **B: Bucharest sahar maa**.

The passage explicitly states that the event ""Cowparade ayojana gurney dakshin purvi europema pahilo hunechha"" and that this is happening in Bucharest as part of an effort to transform the city's image.
"
Tala die madhye kun wakya le cowparade lai sahi rupmaa varnan garchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Yo sansarkai sabai bhandaa thulo sarvajanik kala karyakram ho** (This is the world's largest public art program).

The passage states that CowParade is ""wishwako sabaibhanda thulo sarvajanik kala karyakram"" which directly translates to ""the world's largest public art program.""
"
Ke karan le rus le II-76 ko prayog banda garyo?,"The correct answer is **B: Ek durghatna (An accident)**.

The passage states: ""...gaeko mahina rasiyama gambhir durghatana dekhisakeko cha. October 7 maa udan garda euta engine alaggio, jasma kunai chotpatak lagena. tyo durghatanapachhi rusle II-76s ko udan kehi samay pratibandhit garyo."" which translates to ""...a serious accident had already occurred in Russia last month. On October 7, an engine failed during the flight, but there were no injuries. After that accident, Russia temporarily banned the flights of II-76s.""

Therefore, the accident is the direct reason Russia temporarily grounded the II-76s.
"
II-76 bhaneko ke ho?,"The correct answer is **C: hawai jahaz**

The passage states ""Aircraft irkatskatarf badhiraheko thiyo..."" and ""1970 co dashakdekhi II-76 rusi ra sobhiyat duwai senako euta pramukh ghatak bhaeko cha..."".  Aircraft translates to ""hawai jahaz"". Therefore, II-76 is an aircraft.
"
The Simpsons ko lekhakiya toli lai kasle niyukta gareko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: Simon**.

The passage states: ""Sun 1989 maa unle brooks ra groningasanga da simpasanharu sirjana garna maddat gare ra uni karyakramko pahilo lekhan tolly niyukta garna jimmewar thee."" This translates to ""In 1989, he helped Brooks and Groening create The Simpsons and he was responsible for appointing the program's first writing team."" Therefore, Simon was responsible for hiring the first writing team.
"
Fluke anusar kasle unlaai sakaratmak tippani ra hausala praaan gareko thiyo?,"The passage states: ""**duwai mahila ra purushharule unilai pathai dherai sakaratmak tippani ra protsahanko karan uni yass n pugeki chin.**"" This translates to ""Both women and men sent her a lot of positive comments and encouragement because of which she reached this point.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: Purush ra mahila dubai vyakti haru** (Both men and women)
"
"Anuchhed anusar, kehi manis haru mahila le ke bare nabolun bhanne chahanthe?","Correct answer: **C: Mahila swasthya**

The passage clearly states that efforts were made to suppress women from speaking about ""mahila swasthya"" (women's health). Therefore, the answer is C.
"
Anuchhed anusar kun graha pinda sabai bhanda gatishil chha?,Correct Answer: A: Prithvi
Kun graha pinda maa paaradarshi taral padaartha bhaeka kholaa ra taal pahichaan garieko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

The passage states: ""Yasalai pani jastai wyawahar garna gairaheko cha. yo pani jastai nai paradarshi cha..."""" and directly mentions ""Titan"". This implies that the liquid bodies (rivers and lakes) are found on Titan.
"
Yea madhye kun nishkarsha pwaankha patta laageko karanle gariekaa hoinan?,"The correct answer is **D: Praya dinosaur haru ko pwankh thiyo bhanne pushti**.

Here's why:

*   **A (Janawar ko pwaankha ko rang):** The passage explicitly mentions that scientists described the feather's colors based on the fossil.
*   **B (Pwaankha udaan ko laagi prayog bhaekaa thienan bhanne bujhai):** The passage concludes that the feathers were likely used for temperature regulation or display, *not* flight, based on their structure.
*   **C (Pwaankha ko bikaas baare jankari):** The passage discusses insights into feather evolution, specifically mentioning the development of the rachis relative to barbs and barbules.
*   **D (Prati dinosaure ko pwankh thiyo bhanne pushti):** The passage only confirms that *at least some* dinosaurs had feathers, so the discovery did not necessarily prove that all dinosaurs had feathers.

Therefore, the option that isn't directly concluded from the feather discovery, as described in the passage, is D."
Dinosaur ko pwaankha maa ke thiena?,"The correct answer is **B: Rachis**.

The passage states: ""Dinosarko pankhetama rachis bhanine soft ramrosanga wiksit nabhae pani barbs ra barbules namak pankhetaka any gunharu hune bhaekale khojkartaharule rachis sambhawatah yea dui gunharubhanda pachhi wiksit bhaeko hunu parchha bhane kurako n nikaleka chan.""

This directly translates to: ""Although the rachis, which is called the soft part in the dinosaur's feather, was not well developed, other features of the feather like barbs and barbules were present, so the researchers concluded that the rachis must have developed later than these two features.""

Therefore, rachis was not well-developed in the dinosaur feather.

Tala die madhye ZMapp ko bare maa kun wakya sahi hoina?,"Sahi uttara B ho: Yasle bhaekaa sankraman haru ko upachar garna sakchha tara mrityu ko rokthaam garna sakdaina.

Anweshak harule naya chip kaha sabai bhanda mahatwapurna hune bichar garekaa chhan?,"The correct answer is **A: Kam aaya bhaekaa muluk haru (Come aya bhaeka deshharuma)**

The passage specifically states: ""Dhani deshharuko tulanama come aya bhaeka deshharuma cancer, kshayarog, hiv ra maleriako pahichan lagauna sakha bhanera stan cancer jasta rogharubata baanchne darr adha hune pramukh anweshakharuko bhanai cha."" This translates to, ""...in countries with less income compared to rich countries, it can help identify diseases like cancer, tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria, potentially halving the fear of surviving breast cancer, according to the lead researchers."" This clearly indicates the researchers believe the new chip will be most important in countries with lower incomes.
"
Diagnostic upakaran ko nirmaan garna kun bidhi ko prayog garine chha?,"Correct Answer: **B: Manak inkjet printer**

Explanation:

The passage clearly states that the new diagnostic tool uses a ""small printable chip that can be possibly made for almost one US cent using standard inkjet printers"". Therefore, standard inkjet printers are used in the creation of the diagnostic tool.

While ""Print garna milne chip haru"" (printable chips) are a *component* of the process, the *method* used is inkjet printing.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, lobate scarps ko baare maa kun vakhya sahi hoina?","The correct answer is **D: Yea chandrama ko sataha maa dherai bhetieka thienan**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Tin ko nirman garne ghatana haru bharkharai bhaeka thie** - The passage states: ""Tiniharulai sirjana gurney bhaugolik ghatana halasalai bhaeko dekhaune..."" This supports that the events creating the scarps were recent.

*   **B: Uniharuko upasthiti le chandrama maa bhaugolik gatiwidhi ko kami chhaina** - The passage explicitly says the theory refutes the claim that the moon is completely geologically inactive.

*   **C: Yo chandrama ko sankuchan ko natija ho** - The passage states: ""Chandramako sataha failieka landfarm vaigyanikharule patta lagae jaslai lobet scarp bhaninchha june chandramama bistarai kamjor hundai gaeko cha."" The meaning is lost in translation, but the passage states that the lobate scarps are related to the moon shrinking (sankuchan).

*   **D: Yea chandrama ko sataha maa dherai bhetieka thienan** - The passage does not state anywhere whether the lobate scarps are abundant or rare on the moon's surface. It only focuses on their existence and implications. Therefore, this statement is NOT supported by the passage."
"Anuchhed anusar, landform sambandhi kun siddhanta le chandrama maa bhaugolik gatiwidhi hune sanket garchha?","The correct answer is **D: Landform haru bharkharai matra baneka thie**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ""lobate scarps"" discovered on the moon indicate that the moon is slowly shrinking. The passage emphasizes that the **geological events that created these scarps are recent**.  This recency is crucial because it suggests that the moon is still geologically active, contrary to the long-held belief that it's completely inactive.  If the landforms were very old (Option B), they wouldn't necessarily indicate *current* geological activity. Options A and C don't directly link landforms to geological activity. The recency is the key factor implying ongoing activity.

"Anuchhed anusar, abhiyogko bela sama ke kura hune chhaina?","Paragraph anusar, abhiyogko belasamma Crown Office le kunai tippani nagarne sanket gareko chha.

Tyas karan, sahi uttar **A: Aru tippani** ho."
"Anuchhed anusar, kun sealer haru kaa lagi vidhyaman samasya hoina?","The passage states:

*   Extreme weather conditions are hindering rescue efforts.
*   The amount and thickness of pack ice are the worst for sealers in the last 15 years.

The passage mentions extreme weather conditions, the amount of pack ice, and the thickness of pack ice as problems. It **doesn't** explicitly mention ""paglieko hiun"" (melted snow/ice) as a specific problem hindering rescue efforts or affecting sealers.

Therefore, the answer is **D: Paglieko hiun**.
"
"Hiun baahek, uddar karya lai kele asar gariraheko chha?","Correct answer: **B: Mausam ko awastha**

Explanation:

The passage states that ""Pisaune barafka sathasathai charm mausamka karan uddhar karyama badha purryairaheko cha."" This translates to ""Along with the crushing ice, extreme weather is also hindering the rescue operation."" Thus, weather conditions are affecting the rescue efforts.
"
Roberts le kun biswas ko pramarikaran garna bata pachhi hate?,"The correct answer is **C: Jiwan ko suruwat** (The beginning of life).

The passage states that Roberts explicitly refused to speak about when he believes life begins, considering it unethical to make specific comments on a potential case before him. This indicates he backed away from confirming his belief about the beginning of life.
"
Roberts le kun bisay bahas garna anaitik hune mahasus gare?,"The correct answer is **P: Roberts le kun bisay bahas garna anaitik hune mahasus gare?**

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Robertsle sambhawit kesharuko vishishtatama tippani garna anaitik hune bhandai garbhapatanko naitiktama vichar garda ek mahatwapurna prashna jeevan kahile suru hunchha bhane unle vishwas garchhan bhannema bolna thadai aswikar gare."" This translates to, ""Roberts directly refused to speak about what he believes is an important question when considering the ethics of abortion - when does life begin - saying it would be unethical to comment specifically on potential cases.""

Therefore, Roberts felt it was unethical to discuss specific details related to potential cases about abortion, which includes answering the question of when life begins.

None of the other options fit as closely:

*   Sarvochcha adalat kaa adesh haru: Supreme court orders
*   Roe viru wade ko nirnay: Roe v Wade decision
*   Nihit gopaniyata ko adhikaar: Implicit right to privacy
*   Mudda kaa vivaran haru: Case details

While Roe v Wade and privacy rights are related to the discussion, the specific unethical aspect for Roberts was commenting on potential cases."
Prakash kaa dui kiran haru kaha chamkirahekaa chan?,"The correct answer is **A: Aakash tarfa**

The passage states: ""Ratbhar akashatirko binduma prakashka dui bimharu lagaieka thee"" which translates to ""Two beams of light were directed at a point in the direction of the sky all night.""
"
"Anuchhed anusar, ukta sthan maa naya gagan chumbi bhawan haru kahile banne chhan?","The correct answer is **D: Nirman karya jari chha**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kshetrama yatayat kendra ra madhya bhagma smarak parksahit naya paanch gaganchumbi bhawanharuko **nirman karya zari raheko cha**."" This translates to ""Construction work is underway for five new skyscrapers in the area, including a transportation hub and a memorial park in the center.""

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Din ko bich maa** (In the middle of the day): The passage doesn't specify when the construction happens during the day.
*   **B: Bihan 8:46 baje** (8:46 AM): This refers to the time of a specific event (the crash) and not the construction schedule.
*   **C: Raat ratai** (Overnight): While construction might happen at night, the passage only confirms that the construction is ""zari raheko cha"" (underway/ongoing)."
Kun jankaari le janauchha ki “saat didibahiniharu” gufa hun bhanera?,"The correct answer is **A: Tapkram maa bhinnata (Temperature difference)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Infrared taswirharule ratka tapakram bhinnataharu ra dinle tiniharu sambhawatah gufaharu hun bhane dekhaunchha. Tiniharu waripariko satahabhanda dinma thanda ra ratma nano hunchhan."" This directly links temperature differences to the possibility of them being caves.
"
“Saat didibahiniharu” ko thermal kriyakalap kasari awalokan garinchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Infrared chitra haru**.

The passage states: ""Infrared taswirharule ratka tapakram bhinnataharu ra dinle tiniharu sambhawatah gufaharu hun bhane dekhaunchha."" This directly indicates that infrared images are used to observe the thermal activity of the ""Seven Sisters"" (Saat didibahiniharu).
"
"Anuchhed anusar, aropit bare kun wakya sahi hoina?","The correct answer is **D: U ghaite bhaena**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the suspected bomber was injured in the explosion.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

*   **A: Usle akraman ko samaya maa gadi ko prayog garyo (He used a vehicle during the attack):** The passage says he drove a three-wheeled vehicle into the crowd.
*   **B: Uslaai bisfotak padartha padkaeko aarop chha (He is accused of detonating explosives):** The passage indicates he is suspected of detonating a bomb.
*   **C: Usko jatiyata bare adhikaari haru laai thaha chha (Authorities know his ethnicity):** The passage explicitly states that authorities don't know if he's a member of the Uighur ethnic group, so they don't know his ethnicity for certain.

Therefore, D is the only statement that is demonstrably false based on the provided text."
Aakraman baare adhikaari harule kun jaankaari ko pusti garekaa chhan?,"Prasna P le bataauncha ki adhikaariharule aakraman garchan ki aakraman garchan.

Ellis park maa kun toli le match khelne chhan?,"Correct answer: C: South Africa ra Australia

Explanation:
Paragraphle bhandachh ki Springboxle Australiasanga yass shringkhalako antim khel arko hapta johannesburgko Ellis Parkma khelne bhaniyeko cha. Springbox Dakshin Africa ko lagi prayog gariyeko naam ho. Atah, Ellis Parkma Dakshin Africa ra Australia bich match hunechha.
"
Springboks le arko match kaha khelne chhan?,"The correct answer is **C: Johannesburg**.

The passage states ""Springboxle australiasanga yass shringkhalako antim khel arko hapta johannesburgko alys parkma khelne bhaniyeko cha."" which translates to ""Springboks are scheduled to play the final match of this series against Australia next week at Ellis Park in Johannesburg.""

"
"Anuchhed anusar, antarikshya station ko mission ke laxya thiyo?","The correct answer is **C: Antariksha maa paidal yaatra pura garne (Completing the spacewalk)**

Here's why:

* **The paragraph focuses on the station maintaining its attitude despite the gyroscope problem.** This is important to allow other activities to continue, including a spacewalk.
* **The spacewalk is mentioned as having a ""planned time"" before the gyroscope problem arose.**
*The paragraph mentions about the astronauts, Chiao and Sharipov were able to complete the spacewalk safely despite the gyroscope problem.
* **The other options are incorrect:**
    *  A: haraaeko gyroscope paaune - Although a gyroscope was lost, the goal of the mission was NOT to find it, but to continue the mission despite its loss.
    *  B: Samaayojan thruster ko najik pugne - The astronauts reported being a safe distance from the thrusters, not trying to get closer to them.
    *  D: Jet laai sakriya banaaune - Activating the jets was a recovery step *after* the gyroscope problem, not the primary mission objective.

"Anuchhed anusar, Vidal le tin season aghi kun club baata khelna suru gareka thie?","Let's break down the information provided in passage P:

* **""28-warsha-umerka vidal sebhilabata teen sijanaghi barsama samel bhae.""** This translates to: ""28-year-old Vidal joined Barça three seasons ago from Sevilla.""
* **""Catalan- capital gaepachhibata, bhidalle clubka lagi 49 khelharu kheleka thiye.""** This translates to: ""Apart from Catalan-Capital, Vidal played 49 games for the club."" This doesn't give us his *previous* club.

Therefore, according to the first part of the passage, Vidal joined Barça from Sevilla.

The correct answer is **A: Sevilla**
"
Vidal le Barca kaa laagig kati khel kheleka chhan?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The passage explicitly states that Vidal played 49 games for the club while in the Catalan capital.
"

Jarque kina hotel maa basekaa thie?,"The correct answer is **C: Unko aitabar match thiyo**.

The passage states that he was at the hotel before the planned match against Bologna on Sunday (aitabar). This implies the reason he was at the hotel was related to the match.
"
Jakarta bhubhautiki agency le kina chetawani jaari garena?,"D: Bhukampa ko awashyak pariman pugena

The passage states: ""jakarta bhubhautiki agencyka anusar bhukampale 6.5 parimanko awashyakta pura nagarekale sunamiko chetawani zari garine chhaina.""  This directly translates to ""According to the Jakarta Geophysical Agency, the tsunami warning will not be issued because the earthquake did not meet the required magnitude of 6.5.""

Therefore, the reason the agency did not issue a warning is because the earthquake's magnitude wasn't high enough.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, bhukampa le ke garyo?","Correct answer is **D: 6.5 pariman**

The passage states ""...bhukampale 6.5 parimanko awashyakta pura nagarekale..."". This directly indicates the earthquake reached a magnitude that was related to 6.5.  The other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the quake caused people to panic, it isn't what it *did* in a direct, physical sense.
*   **B:** The paragraph explicitly states there was no tsunami risk.
*   **C:** The paragraph says a warning was *not* issued."
Yea madhye kunle surya ra aru sabai taraa haruko kriyakalap laai utprerit garchhan?,"Prashna le surya ra anya tara haruko kriyakalap lai kele prerit garchha bhanne sodhchha.

Rossby number, chumbakiya utkraman (magnetic reversal) sanga sambandhit chha, tara tara ko kriyakalap lai prerit gardaina.

Tasartha, sahi jawab C ho: **Parikrama ra ujyaalopana**
"
Taaraa ko rossby sankhyaa kasari nikaalinchha?,"The passage states that ""Plasma praahasanga sambandhit bhaeko prakash ra rotation ek sath tarako sankhya nirdharan garna pani prayog garinchha."" This translates to ""Light and rotation related to plasma flow are also used to determine the Rossby number of a star.""

Option A, ""Ujyaalopana ra parikramaa"" (Brightness and Rotation), directly corresponds to the information given in the passage.

The passage also mentions that ""Rasbi sankhya jati sano hunchha, chumbakiya utkramanko sambandhama uti come sakriya tara."" (The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to magnetic reversal). While this relates Rossby number to magnetic reversal, it does not state how the Rossby number is *calculated*.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Ujyaalopana ra parikramaa**.
"

"Anuchhed anusar, Swiss mahila laai ke bhaena?","The correct answer is **B: Unko mrityu bhayo** (She died).

The paragraph states the following happened to the Swiss woman:

*   Her stolen laptop and mobile phone were recovered.
*   She was raped by five men.
*   Her phone and laptop were stolen.

The paragraph doesn't mention her death, so option B is the correct answer to the question ""What didn't happen to the Swiss woman according to the paragraph?""."

This translates to ""The post office apologized to the public and the media after it was discovered that a boy had hidden more than 600 postal papers, including 429 New Year's postcards, which were not delivered to their expected recipients."" Thus, the boy was responsible for hiding the mail.

The passage states that the handwritten document was signed by John Hancock (Congress President) and Charles Thomson (Secretary). While John Dunlop printed the copies and George Washington received one, they did not sign the original manuscript. John Nixon read it aloud.
"
"nimna sthan haru madhye, dunlap broadside antim maa kaha aayeko thiyo?","Correct answer is **C: london**

Here's why:

*   The text states that a copy of the Dunlap Broadside reached London on August 10. While other locations are mentioned, London is the last place the text explicitly says a copy arrived."
karnal stark ko sipahiharu kaha awasthit thee?,"The passage states: ""Starkka manisharule upaniweshwadiko sthitiko uttari chheuma barma sthan lie"" which translates to ""Stark's men occupied a fortified position on the northern edge of the colonial position."" It also says ""jab prayadwipko uttarpurvama mystic nadiko kinarma nyun jwarle pwal banayo, tiniharule sano tatama paniko kinara antya hune uttarsamma chhoto dhungako parkhalko gherabar turuntai lambyae,"" meaning ""when a low tide exposed a gap in the northeastern part of the peninsula on the banks of the Mystic River, they quickly extended a short stone fence around the small beach up to where the water's edge ended."" Then, it mentions ""Gridle wa starkle barka aghadi karib 100 feat (30 meter) co hissedari rakhe ra aadesh die key jabasamma niyamit wyaktiharu paar gardainan, tabasamma kasaile ago laga,"" which means ""Gridley and Stark shared about 100 feet (30 meters) in front of the barracks and ordered that no one should fire until the regulars passed.""

Considering this information, here's the analysis of each option:

*   **A: uttar tira, parkhal sangai (North side, along the fence):** This is a correct option as Stark's men occupied the northern edge, and they extended a stone fence. They were positioned along the fence in the north.
*   **B: paniko kinaara ko tat maa (On the shore of the water):** While the fence extended to the water's edge, the main statement says northern edge of the position. So, this is not the primary location but a part of the area they controlled.
*   **C: peninsula ko uttarpurvatira (On the northeast of the peninsula):** The low tide revealing a gap occurred on the northeast, and they extended a fence there. They are located near the fence, not on the peninsula, so this is not the exact location.
*   **D: parkhaalko agadi (In front of the fence):** The last part of the paragraph says that Gridley and Stark were in front of the barracks, not necessarily in front of the fence.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **A: uttar tira, parkhal sangai (North side, along the fence).**

This translates to: ""When the low tide made a hole on the shore of the Mystic River in the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly extended a short stone wall enclosure in the small shore up to the north where the edge of the water ended.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: kam chhaal bhayeko bela (when there was low tide)**

"anucched anusar, ghumante charanma jaada sena kamila koloni barey ke satya ho?","The correct answer is **B: uniharusanga khaanaako aapurti kam chha**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Upalabdha khana come bhaeko bella upaniweshle khanabandiko charan suru garchha."" (When food is less available, the colony starts a foraging phase). This directly indicates a lack of sufficient food supply triggers the nomadic foraging.

nimna madhye bahya sanket upasthit hunda pani ke jaari rahanchha?,"The passage states that biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain independent-running cycles even in the absence of external cues. Therefore, even when external signals are absent, biological clocks continue to function.  The passage also describes *endogenous cycles* as relying on the presence of internal clocks.

While periodic rhythms and observed rhythms *can* be influenced by external cues, they are rooted in the internal biological clocks.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is:

**C: jaivik ghadiharu (biological clocks)**

The passage states: ""Jab wyaktiharule kunai vishesh gunka dherai rupharu dekhaunchhan tiniharu bahurupi hunchhan."" This translates to ""When individuals display many forms of a particular trait, they are polymorphic."" Therefore, the term used to describe individuals exhibiting various phenotypic traits is polymorphic.

This directly translates to: ""Each pair of numbers can only have one of two values, such as 00 or 11, and these numbers are called bits - or in computer jargon.""

Therefore, binary numbers are also referred to as bits.

nimna madhye kun laai vidyarthi bloggin gko prathamik faida bhanera anuchhed maa ullekhit garieko chhaina?,"The correct answer is **B: samakakshi haru bata alochanako kami**.

Here's why:

*   **A: wyakaran ra lekhan kshamata maa sudhar** - The passage explicitly states that blogging helps students improve their grammar and writing skills (""Vidyarthiko lekhan blagharule pani sudharna maddat garchhan... blog lekhakle alochanabata jogin lekhanlai sudhar garna cosis garna thalchhan."").

*   **C: aafno waripari ko watavaran bare thap sachetana** - The passage mentions that blogging ""badhya parchha"" students to be more understanding of ""uniharuko warparko vishwaka barema"" (their surrounding world).

*   **D: gyan arjan garne ichhyama bridhi** - The passage implies this by stating that blogging encourages students to become more analytical and critical and expands their education beyond the traditional school day.

*   **B: samakakshi haru bata alochanako kami** - While the passage says that bloggers try to improve their writing to *avoid* criticism, it doesn't say that there is a *lack* of criticism. In fact, the opposite is implied: the fear of criticism motivates improvement.

Therefore, the primary benefit *not* mentioned in the passage is the lack of criticism from peers."
nimna madhey bloggingko kun pakshya laai vidyarthiko lekhan kshamata sudhaar garne prerak bhanera ullekh gariyeko chha?,"The correct answer is **B: alochana bata jogine tibra ichhyaa (A strong desire to avoid criticism)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Vidyarthiharu prayajso sabaibhanda mahatwapoorn darshak bhaekale, blog lekhakle alochanabata jogin lekhanlai sudhar garna cosis garna thalchhan.""  This translates to ""Because students are often the most important audience, the blog writer starts trying to improve their writing to avoid criticism."" This clearly links the desire to avoid criticism to improved writing.

Let's look at why the other options are less direct:

* **A: internet maa bhaekaa samagriharu mathi lagatar jawaf diera (By continuously responding to content on the internet):** While the passage mentions actively responding to internet content, it's presented as a way to become more analytical and define one's own position, not directly as a motivator for improving *writing* skills.
* **C: srotaaharuko ruchi kayam rakhne (Maintaining the interest of the audience):** The passage says this motivates students to be clever and engaging. While related to good writing, it's not the primary *motivator* for improving the *mechanics* of writing (grammar, spelling), which is the focus of the question.
* **D: sahakaarya garne aawashkyata (The need to collaborate):** While blogging promotes collaboration, the passage doesn't directly link collaboration as the *driving force* behind improved writing skills.

vidyarthiharuko lagi nimna madhye kun atulyakalik sanchar ko faida hoina? ,"The correct answer is **B: dinko kunaipani samayma prashikshak haru sanga aamne samne pahunch.**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that asynchronous communication allows students to ask questions at any time of day, rather than waiting for a face-to-face meeting. This means they **don't** get face-to-face access at any time.

The other options are benefits of asynchronous communication mentioned in the passage:

*   **A: srotko rupma internetko prayog:** The passage mentions using the internet and the World Wide Web to access information at any time.
*   **C: karya garna ko lagi lachilo samay:** The passage states that asynchronous communication offers flexible learning times.
*   **D: gati niyantran:** The passage says that asynchronous communication allows students to control the pace of learning and information."

anuchhedma madhyayugin mahalsanga sambandhit ke ullekhit garieko chhaina?,"The correct answer is **D: yoddha (warrior)**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Kalko khadal (lime pit):** The passage mentions ""kalko khadalbata uthne darko gandha"" (the smell of terror rising from the lime pit).
*   **B: Ghoda chadhi gardai judhnu (fighting on horseback):** The passage mentions ""jadumaya ghoda chadheko pratima"" (magical horse-riding statues) and the sound of hooves.
*   **C: Shishtata (chivalry):** The passage mentions ""bhoj ra artharko palako shishtatako chitraharulai"" (pictures of banquets and chivalry at court).
*   **D: Yoddha (warrior):** While warfare and battles are alluded to, the passage does not explicitly mention the term ""yoddha"".

Therefore, the answer is **D**."
nimna madhye kun kura anuchhedmaa mahal bhangnawshesh haru maajh utpanna huney gandha waa aawaj ko rupmaa ullekh garieko chhaina?,"The correct answer is **C: bhoj**.

The paragraph mentions the following sounds and smells experienced amidst the castle ruins:

*   Sounds of past battles.
*   Smell of fear rising from the dungeons.
*   Sound of hooves on the stones.

While the paragraph mentions ""bhoj ra artharko palako shishtatako chitraharulai"" (paintings of feasts and the civility of the Arthurian court) as inspiration for art, it doesn't mention the *smell* or *sound* of feasts being present at the ruins. Therefore, feasts are not mentioned as a smell or sound experienced among the castle ruins."
nimna madhye kun Kirby Maksaloi mahalko sahi varnan hoina?,"The correct answer is **D: tyo lamo ra nirdhaarit akramanharu jhelna banaieko thiyo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Yasaka vishal chamakdar jhyal ra patlo parkhalharu lamo samayasamma nirdharit akramanko pratirodh garna saksham thienan."" which translates to ""Its large shiny windows and thin walls were not capable of withstanding prolonged determined attacks."" This contradicts option D.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

*   **A: mahalko baklo parkhaalharu lord hestings dwara anurodh garieko thiyo**- The passage mentions that the walls were thin and built in a peaceful time which means that the walls were not thick and were in fact requested by Lord Hastings
*   **B: nirmanko samayma desh shanta vatavaranma bhayeko karan tesh lai nyunatam killabandhiko aawashyakta paryo** - The passage states the country was relatively peaceful when construction began, necessitating only defenses against small groups of raiders.
*   **C: tyo samay awadhiko lagi tesh mahalko nirman swabhavik thiena**- The passage states the castle was not a typical castle fort of that time as it was larger and more sophisticated."
nimna madhye kun nirman viseshta lai anucchedma warnan gariyeko samay awadhi dauran ma Kirby Maksaloi mahalko aakriti ko lagi aswabhavik maninthiyo?,"The passage states that Kirby Muxloe Castle had ""vishal chamakdar jhyal ra patlo parkhalharu"" (large, bright windows and thin walls). It also says these were not very effective against sustained attacks. The passage contrasts this with the fact that the castle was built during a relatively peaceful time when only defense against small bands of raiders was necessary.

Therefore, the *thin walls* and *large windows* were not ideal for defense against serious sieges and therefore unusual for a castle.

*   **A: thula jhyalharu (large windows)** - The passage indicates this was unusual, as it provided less defense.
*   **B: akramanharu jhelna sakne banayeka jag (foundations built to withstand attacks)** - This is a standard feature of castles, not unusual.
*   **C: kehi mahalharu vanda kam killabandhi (less fortified than some castles)** - While implied, the *specific features* contributing to that lack of fortification are what's being asked about.
*   **D: patalo parkhalharu (thin walls)** - The passage indicates this was unusual, as it provided less defense.

Between thin walls and large windows, large windows are more unusual for a castle built for defense. Therefore the correct answer is **A: thula jhyalharu**."
"anucched anusaar, nimna madhey kun agu season ko lagi tayari gariraheko dhawak ko lagi sabai bhanda badhi lavdayak hunchha?","Correct answer is **D: sharir ko mathillo bhag ko kasharat garna jimkhana ko faida uthaunu**

**Reasoning:**

The passage states: ""Sharirko mathillo bhagko lagi wyayamko sath sanyukta, jadoko samayama hune kehi cross country daud daud sijanka lagi uttam tayari ho."" (Combined with exercise for the upper body, some cross country races during the winter are excellent preparation for the running season).

This clearly suggests that upper body exercises are beneficial for preparing for the running season. Option D best reflects this statement.
"
"anucched anusar, nimna madhye kun ek pratham shreniko adha-mile dhaawak ko lagi sabai bhanda badhi awashyak hunchha?","Correct Answer: **B: gati bhanda badhi dhairyata badhaunu**

Reasoning:

The passage explicitly states that when transitioning from a quarter-mile to a half-mile race, endurance (dhairyata) becomes more important than speed (gati). While a first-class half-miler needs decent speed, the passage emphasizes that endurance must be prioritized above all else. Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.

"anuchhed anusaar, madhya duree dhawak le kina mahango samagri kinna saknechhan?","The correct answer is **A: yo uniharuko vyaktigat rojai ho** (it is their personal choice).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that expensive equipment doesn't necessarily improve performance.** It states that many people have misconceptions about what equipment is needed and that many products have little to no real impact on performance.
* **Option B is incorrect** because the passage suggests there are *not* proven benefits.
* **Option C is incorrect** because the passage explicitly says expensive equipment has *little* impact.
* **Option D is not the primary reason** why someone might *choose* to buy expensive items; it explains the general misconception but not the individual's reasoning.

Therefore, if a middle-distance runner buys expensive equipment, it's likely a personal choice, perhaps based on marketing or a belief in psychological benefits, even if the equipment itself doesn't demonstrably improve their time.
"
"anuchhed anusaar, euta madhyam duree daudlai ke chahinchha?","Correct answer is **C: ekdum thorai samagriharu**.

The passage states that middle-distance running is relatively inexpensive and that many people have misconceptions about the equipment required. It also suggests that many products have little to no actual impact on performance.
"
anawik chumbakiya anunad kasley patta lagayo? ,"The correct answer is **C: bloch ra purcell** (Bloch and Purcell).

The passage states: ""MRI anawik chumbakiya anunad (NMR) bhanne bhautik vigyan ghatanama adharit cha, june 1930 co dashakma **felix bloch** (stanford vishwavidyalayama karyarat) ra **Edward Purcell** (harward vishwavidyalayabata) dwara patta lagaieko thiyo.""

This translates to ""Understanding the intentions of others is important within this ability. It allows us to resolve potential ambiguities of physical actions.""

Therefore, the answer is **B: abhipraaya** (intentions).
"
"anuchhed anusaar, abhipraya bujhnale manisharulai ke garna maddat gardachha?","The correct answer is **A: sharirik karyaharu pachhadiko anishchitata hataunu**.

The passage explicitly states that understanding intention allows us to resolve potential ambiguities in physical actions (""hamilai sharirik karyaharuko sambhawit aspashtatama yasale samadhan garna anumati dinchha""). The car window example directly illustrates this point. Therefore, option A is the best fit.
"
"anuchhed anusaar, nimna madhey kun ai ko mukhya uddeshyako sahi saramsha ho?","The correct answer is **D: karya swachalan (task automation)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ai maa anusandhanle karyaharu swachalit garna messinharu banaune samawesh garchha jaslai baudhik wyawahar awashyak parchha"" which translates to: ""AI research includes building machines to automate tasks that require intellectual behavior.""  While the other options are examples of AI applications, the *main* purpose, as described in the passage, is task automation.
"
"anuchhed anusaar, nimna madhye kun sanga AIlai praya jodera herinchha?","The passage mentions ""yojana ra anusuchi banaune"" (planning and scheduling) and ""hastalekhan pahichan"" (handwriting recognition) as examples of AI applications. However, it does *not* explicitly mention ""grahak sewa"" (customer service) or ""vigyan katha"" (science fiction).

Between ""yojana ra anusuchi banaune"" and ""hastalekhan pahichan"", ""yojana ra anusuchi banaune"" is explicitly mentioned as an example in the paragraph when describing what AI can do.

Therefore, the best answer is **B: yojana ra anusuchi banauney**.
"
"anucched anusaar, nimna madhye kun abhisaran soch dhancha bhayeko vyaktiko gun ho?","The passage describes convergent thinking as a problem-solving approach that unifies different ideas and fields to find a single correct answer. People with this mindset are characterized by speed, accuracy, and efficiency. They are good at identifying facts, reusing existing methods, and gathering information. The passage also states they have logical thinking, can remember structures, solve problems, and work in scientific experiments.

Looking at the options:

*   A: A person who recognizes multiple correct answers has divergent thinking, the opposite of convergent.
*   B: Applying new methods doesn't necessarily fit the description. Convergent thinkers tend to reuse existing methods.
*   C: Taking time to solve problems doesn't necessarily align with the speed emphasized in the passage.
*   D: The passage explicitly states that individuals with convergent thinking can remember structures.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: dhanchaa haru ko yaad garnu** (remembering structures)."
"anuchhed anusaar, nimna madhey kun abhisaran sochai manasikta ko kendrabindu manidaina?","The correct answer is **B: Afno samaya line**.

Let's break down why:

* **P's description of Puratanbadi sochai (Convergent Thinking):**  The paragraph emphasizes speed, accuracy, identifying facts, reusing existing methods, gathering information, and the belief that there's *only one right answer*.

* **A: Euta matra sahi jawaf chha bhanney bujhai (Understanding that there is only one correct answer):**  This is directly stated as a key aspect of this mindset.  It's the core belief driving convergent thinking.

* **C: Tathyaharu pahichan garnu (Identifying Facts):**  The paragraph specifically mentions ""tathyaharuko pahichan"" (identification of facts).

* **D: Jankari batulnu (Gathering Information):**  The paragraph also explicitly states ""jankari sankalan"" (information collection).

* **B: Afno samaya line (Taking one's time):** Convergent thinking prioritizes speed and efficiency to arrive at the singular correct answer. ""Taking one's time"" implies a more deliberate, potentially explorative approach, which is opposite to the speed and efficiency mentioned in the passage.

Therefore, ""afno samaya line"" (taking one's time) is the opposite of what's emphasized in the passage, and thus is not a focus of convergent thinking.

nimna madhey punarutthanle ko karan le kun kura ajha mahatwapurna bhayo? ,"The correct answer is **C: path samjhana (path lai samjhane kshamata)**.

The passage states that during the Renaissance (punarutthan), there was less emphasis on personal memory (""wyaktigat samjhanabhitra kunai dabawa thiena"") and *more* focus on the ability to memorize texts (""pathlai samjhane kshamata dherai kendrikaranko bhayo"").  Therefore, memorizing texts became more important.
"
"punarutthan ko karan, nimna madhey kun lai kam mahatwa pradan gariyo?","The correct answer is **A: wyaktigat samjhana**.

The passage states that during the Renaissance (punarutthan), the focus shifted from individual memory to the ability to remember texts/passages (path samjhana). The passage indicates that individual memory (wyaktigat samjhana) was no longer as emphasized, meaning it was given less importance.

This translates to: ""As a result of the crusades, one of the most important things that people developed at that time was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: crusade**.

The passage explicitly states that while joining environmental movements and becoming activists are helpful, they are like treating the symptoms. To find a *lasting* solution, we need to identify and address the *root causes* of the problems.

Therefore, no specific country from the choices is mentioned as the sole country where a war was fought for the balance of power for the first time.

However, the question asks where a war *is believed* to be about balance of power instead of religion. The passage mentions the War of the Spanish Succession. While it doesn't explicitly state which country this war was primarily *in*, it's heavily linked to **Spain** because it's the *Spanish* Succession.

Therefore, the most reasonable answer is **D: Spain**.

The passage states: ""Ek thaunma bhidka ek sadasyale bhayawit raniko aghadi bharselasma marieka ek shahi surakshakarmiko tauko pani hallayo."" This translates to ""At one place, a member of the crowd also waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen."" This clearly indicates that a guard was killed in Versailles.
"
nimna madhye raja ra rani laai bhidle jabarjasti ke garna lagayenan?,"The correct answer is **C: surakshakarmiko tauko kateko herna**.

Here's why:

*   **A: uniharuko gadiko jhyalharu kholna:** The passage states the crowd forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows open.
*   **B: versailles bata achanak niskashan:** The passage clearly states they were forced to leave Versailles for Paris.
*   **D: paris firtaa ko yatra:** They were forced to travel back to Paris.
*   **C: surakshakarmiko tauko kateko herna:** The passage only mentions that a member of the crowd shook the head of a royal guard in front of the queen. There is no statement that they had to directly watch the actual act of beheading.

Therefore, option C did not happen and is the correct answer."
nimna madhye kun belayatko aparamparkik naval yuddhako natija thiena?,"The correct answer is **C: antarashtriya kanun haru maa pariwartan gariyo** (international laws were changed).

The passage states that Britain's naval blockade *violated* existing international laws, not that it changed them. The other options are directly supported by the passage:

*   **A: germanyko testai yuddha rananiti prayog garney ichhyaa** (Germany's desire to use similar war tactics): The passage explicitly says Germany expected similar backlash for its submarine warfare, implying a desire to use similar tactics.
*   **B: sanmlagna nabhayekaa jahajharu jokhim ma pareka thie** (Non-involved ships were at risk): The passage states that neutral ships were put at risk.
*   **D: mahatwapurna apurtiharu pahunch garna sakiena** (Important supplies could not be accessed): The passage states that the blockade stopped important military and civilian supplies.

Therefore, option C is the only one that was NOT a result of Britain's unconventional naval warfare."
kun chai vakya le belayatko germany biriuddha naval nakabandiko varnan gardaina?,"The correct answer is **D: yesley tatastha jahajharu jokhimma nahuney sunischit garyo**.

The passage states that the British naval blockade put neutral ships at risk, directly contradicting option D. The other options are all supported by the passage:

*   **A:** The passage explicitly mentions the blockade violated international law.
*   **B:** The passage says the blockade prompted Germany's unrestricted submarine warfare.
*   **C:** The passage states the blockade cut off Germany's military and civilian supplies.
Therefore, option D is the only one that is NOT a description of the British naval blockade against Germany."

The passage explicitly states that ""Niyamit gatiwidhima bhag liirahekaharulai pidako nakaratmak dharanako sartama adhik samarthanko awashyakta pardachha..."" which translates to ""Those participating in regular activities need more support in terms of negative perceptions of pain...""

Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer.
"
"anuchhed anusar, taraarwaji praya: kasari khelinchha?","The correct answer is **D: dwanda ko prarupma**.

The paragraph states that ""Khel mukhyataya ek dwell prarupma khelinchh, ek fencerle arkolai dwell gardacha"" which translates to ""The game is mainly played in a duel format, a fencer duels another."" This directly indicates that fencing (taraarwaji) is primarily played in a duel format.

"anuchhed anusar, piditko jaanch garda pahilo sahi kadam ke ho?","The correct answer is **A: sthalko awalokan (स्थलको अवलोकन)**

The paragraph explicitly states: ""Piditko jaanch garna, tapainle pahile afno surakshaka lagi sthalko sarwekshan garnuparchha.""  This translates to: ""To examine the victim, you must first survey the scene for your own safety.""  Therefore, surveying the scene (sthalko awalokan) is the first correct step.
"
nimna kathan madhey kunley piditlai jaanch garney prakriyalai sahi tarika janaudaina?,"The correct answer is **A: afulai chotpatak lagna sakney bare chintit nahunu** (Don't worry about getting injured).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of prioritizing your own safety before helping a victim.  It explicitly states that if you get injured while trying to help, the problem will worsen. Therefore, option A directly contradicts the passage's main point about the proper procedure for checking on a victim. Options B, C, and D are all mentioned in the passage as part of the correct procedure.
"
france ko krantile lyayeko kun pariwartanle mazdoor wargako nagarikharuma sabai bhanda thulo prabhaw lyayo?,"The best answer is **C: ganatantra siddhanta lai grahan garnu** (embracing the principle of a republic).

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** The passage indicates that the revolution sparked a belief in nationalism and the idea that the nation belonged to the people, not just a ruler.

*   **Relevance to the working class:** The idea of a republic, where power resides in the people, would have resonated deeply with the oppressed working class in other countries. It offered a vision of a society where they had a voice and could potentially improve their living conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: rashtrako samarthan ma briddhi** (increased support for the nation): While the revolution fostered nationalism, this would primarily affect the citizens of France and is only a minor impact on the working class.
*   **B: warga bhanda yogyata ma dhyan dinu** (focus on merit rather than class): While the passage mentions this change in the army, this effect is limited to army and not applicable to working class citizens in other countries.
*   **D: ek naya mapan pranali** (a new measurement system): This is too specific and not as fundamental as the shift in political ideology.

Therefore, the adoption of the republican principle is the most profound and far-reaching impact of the French Revolution on the working class citizens of other nations, as it offered a new model for social and political organization."
"france ko kranti pachhi, sainik ra anya peshaharu ma safalta kema dherai adharit nahuney vayo?","The passage states that after the French Revolution, success in military and other professions was open to all ambitious and accomplished male applicants. The passage says that in the army, classifications used to be based on class but now they are based on ability. Therefore, success was more based on ability and less on class or other factors.

The correct answer is **A: uplabdhi** which translates to ""achievement"" or ""accomplishment"". This aligns with the idea that success was now based on what one could achieve, their abilities and accomplishments.
"
vikasit deshharuma sabai bhanda badhi kun sarvajanik sewaley asantushti hunchha vaninchha?,"The passage states that people in developed countries rarely complain about water quality or bridges (""Wiksit deshharuma, tapain paniko gunastar wa pulharu tall jharne jasta barema gunasoharu wirlai sunnuhunchha"").  However, the passage *does* say that ""lagbhag sabaijanale yatayat pranaliharuka barema gunaso gardachan"" (almost everyone complains about transportation systems).

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: sarwajanik yatayat** (public transport).
"
"anuchhed anusaar, sarwajanik yatayat pranaliharu bare ke bhanna sakinchha?","The correct answer is **C: tiniharu ko prayog garne dherale gunaso garchhan**.

The passage clearly states: ""lagbhag sabaijanale yatayat pranaliharuka barema gunaso gardachan"" (almost everyone complains about transportation systems). This translates to ""many who use them complain.""

nimna madhey kun traffic ko bahaav lai ganitiya rupma dekhauda prayog garinchha?,"Correct answer is **D: traffic ko ghanatwa**.

The paragraph states: ""Traffic praahako ramro pratinidhitwa garna, teen mukhya wisheshtaharu beach sambandha sthapit garieko cha: (1) prawaha, (2) ghanatwa, ra (3) beg."" This means flow (prawaha), density (ghanatwa) and speed (beg) are used to mathematically represent traffic flow.  While all options are related to traffic, density is the one directly mentioned as a key feature used in the mathematical representation of traffic flow.
"
hershey ra chase le uniharuko dna pratyaropan garna ke prayog gare? ,"The best answer is **D: virusharu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Bacterium afnai DNA pratyaropan garna hersey ra chejle fages wa bhairas prayog garthe."" This translates to: ""Hershey and Chase used phages or **viruses** to transplant their DNA into bacteria."" While radioactive phosphorus and sulfur were used in the experiment, the question asks what they used to transplant the DNA, not what they used to label it.

Therefore, the correct answer is D."
Utpariwartan santanharulai dina sakne kshamata ke ma nirbhar chha?,"The passage states, ""Jiwanu rekha koshharuma hune utpariwartan bacchalai dina sakinchha."" This directly implies that mutations occurring in germline (jiwanu rekha) cells can be passed on to offspring.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: yedi koshharu jiwanu-rekha ho bhane**.

The passage clearly states: ""pwalko waripariko ghaans chhoto banainchha ra yasalai green bhaninchha"" (the grass around the hole is cut short and is called the green).  Therefore, the grass is cut short in the green.
"
ek parikshanko samanya lakshya ke ho?,"The correct answer is **A: ek wa badhi sambhawit parikalpanaharu hataunu**.

The passage states: ""parikshan (parikshan bhaneko ek jaanch ho june ek wa badhi sambhawit parikalpanaharu hatauna prayog garinchha)"". This directly translates to ""a test (a test is an examination that is used to remove one or more possible hypotheses)"". Therefore, the main goal of an experiment is to eliminate possible hypotheses.

"anuchhed anusar, tufanharubare kun kathan satya hoina?","The correct answer is **C: adhikamsa tufanharu teen ghanta bhanda badhi tikchhan (most hurricanes last longer than three hours)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the *most violent* 2% of hurricanes last *more than three hours*. This implies that the *majority* of hurricanes last *less* than three hours.

The other options are true based on the passage:

*   A: tufanharu le uniharu waripari vayeka sabai kura nashta garna sakchhan (hurricanes can destroy everything around them) - directly stated in the passage.
*   B: anya andhibehari bhanda tufanharuley sano kshetrama prahar garchhan (hurricanes strike a smaller area than other storms) - mentioned in the first line.
*   D: kehi tufanharuko gati 300 miles prati ghanta samma hunchha (some hurricanes can reach speeds of 300 miles per hour) - directly stated in the last line."
"anuchhed anusar, nimna kathanharu madhey kunley adhikamsa tufanharulai sahi tarikaley varnan gardachha?","The correct answer is **D: tiniharu jaminbata rukhharu ukhalna sakchhan** (they can uproot trees from the ground).

Here's why:

*   The paragraph states, ""Aandhibehariharule rukhharu ukhalchhan..."" (Tornadoes uproot trees...). This is a general characteristic mentioned about tornadoes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: teeniharu dherai jaso teen ghanta bhanda badhi tikchaan** (they mostly last more than three hours): The paragraph states that only the most violent 2% of tornadoes last longer than three hours. This is not true of *most* tornadoes.

*   **B: tiniharuley 480 miles prati ghantako gati srijana garchhan** (they create speeds of 480 miles per hour): The paragraph mentions that the most violent tornadoes reach speeds *up to* 480 kilometers/hour. This is only in the extreme cases, not a general characteristic of most tornadoes. The conversion to miles per hour is also not accurate in the original question.

*   **C: tiniharuley anya adhiberi bhanda badhi kshetralai asar garchhan** (they affect more area than other storms): The paragraph indicates that tornadoes affect *small* areas.

"
nimna madhey kun kura mancheharule 16aun shatabdidekhi garna suru gare?,"Correct answer is **D: telescopeharu banauna**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that while people were using lenses for magnification for a long time, the first *true* telescopes were made in Europe towards the end of the 16th century.  The other options (using lenses, magnifying objects, making lenses) were done before the 16th century, according to the passage.
"
mancheharule lensharuko prayog garera wastuharu magnify gareko kati samaya bhayo?,"Correct answer: C

The passage states ""Hajaraun warshadekhi magnificationka mancheharule lensharu banaera prayog gariraheka chan,"" which translates to ""For thousands of years, people have been making and using lenses for magnification."" Therefore, the answer is **C: hajaraun varsha dekhi** (for thousands of years).
"
"anuchhed anusar, muhammadko gufaley usko adhyatmik karyaharu ra manyataharu barey ke bhanchha?","The passage states that Muhammad had a deep interest in life beyond the material world and frequently used a cave for contemplation. The cave, located on a mountain and isolated from the world, offered a space where he could barely see or hear the outside world. This suggests he sought solitude and quiet for his spiritual practices.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: uslai shanta ra ekanta maanparchha (He liked peace and solitude)** This aligns perfectly with the description of the cave as a place of isolation and quiet, suggesting Muhammad sought peace and solitude.

*   **B: bahiri hallaley dhyanma maddat gardacha (External noise helps in meditation)** This is the opposite of what the passage suggests. The passage highlights the cave's isolation to minimize external distractions.

*   **C: uslai thorai ekal samay chahinthyo (He needed a little alone time)** While true to an extent, it doesn't capture the depth of Muhammad's spiritual inclination. The passage suggests a more profound need for isolation than just ""a little alone time.""

*   **D: uslai aafu dekhina ra sunine bare chinta hunthiyo (He was worried about being seen and heard)** The passage doesn't mention any concerns about being seen or heard. The focus is on the isolation for spiritual contemplation.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: uslai shanta ra ekanta maanparchha (He liked peace and solitude)**."
"anuchhed anusar, falam pahila ke kolagi prayog garinthiyo?","Correct Answer: D: rail

Explanation:

The passage states: ""Wistarai, tathapi, yo mahasus bhayo key yadi patariharukamathi falamko steep bhayo bhane adhik kushal hunechha."" which translates to ""Gradually, however, it was felt that it would be more efficient if there was a steel slope on the rails."" This indicates that iron was initially used on top of the wooden rails (patariharu). Therefore, rail is the correct answer.
"
"anuchhed anusar, kathka pangraharulai kina falamka pangraharudwaara pratisthapan gariyo?","Correct answer is **B: tiniharulai ajha prabhawkari maninthiyo** (तिनिहरुलाई अझ प्रभावकारी मानिन्थ्यो).

The passage states that wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels. While the passage does mention that iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels initially, it directly states that iron wheels were introduced because using steel on the rails proved to be more efficient. So, the reason wooden wheels were *replaced* with iron ones was the perceived *increased effectiveness*.
"
"anuchhed anusar, romantikwadma wyaktiharulai kun kurale prabhawit garyo?","The correct answer is **B: bhugol**.

So the correct answer is:
**A: euta madhuro awaj**
"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun madhuro awajsanga sambandhit chaina?","The correct answer is **A: euta down bow chinha**.

Here's why:

*   The paragraph states that an ""up-bow"" (not a down bow) generally produces a softer sound. The passage associates a ""down bow"" with a stronger and more forceful sound.
*   The passage describes the ""down-bow"" symbol as resembling a staple or square without legs, not a V.
*   The passage states that a ""down bow"" starts from the ""frog"" which is where the bow is held.
*   The paragraph associates an up-bow symbol with a ""V"" shaped symbol."

"annuchhed ma bhayeko jankariko adharma, “protein samasya” samadhan garna primate le ke khaanu parchha?","The passage states:

*   Leaves and fruits could be the easiest and most accessible plant sources of protein, but these are difficult to digest for non-ruminants like us.
*   Animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) not only easily digestible because they contain all the essential amino acids, but they provide high amounts of protein.

Therefore, to solve the ""protein problem"", primates should eat animal foods like ants, termites, and eggs. While ""phatyangraharu"" (grasshoppers) isn't specifically listed, it falls under the broader category of ""animal foods.""

Therefore the answer is (C)."
"anucchedko anusar, nimna samasyaharu madhey kun amino acidsko kamile garda bhayeko hoina?","The passage states that failing to meet amino acid requirements leads to:

*   Increased mental anxiety (manasik chintama wriddhi)
*   Malnutrition (kupoṣaṇ)
*   Eventually, death (mrityu)

The passage also explains that plant-based foods like leaves and fruits are difficult for humans to digest, unlike animal-based foods.

Therefore, the only option that is *not* directly mentioned as a consequence of amino acid deficiency is **A: paachan samasya (digestion problem)**. Digestion problem is the *reason* why it is difficult to obtain amino acids from plants, not a *consequence* of lacking amino acids.

So the answer is **A**."
kunai nischit upasanskritiko sadasyaharuly kasari praya tyo samuhasanga uniharuko sanmglantalai janauchhan?,"The correct answer is **D: shaililai pratikwadko rupma prayog garera**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Upasanskritika sadasyaharu pry: shailiko wishishta ra pratikatmak prayogko madhyambata tiniharuko sadasyata sanket gardachan, jasma shaili, tarika ra argot samawesh cha."" This directly translates to ""Subculture members often signal their membership through distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, mannerisms, and argot."" The statement clearly indicates that subculture members use unique style elements as a form of symbolic communication to show their affiliation with the group.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: ghulmil hune prayash garera (trying to blend in):** This is the opposite of what a subculture aims for; they want to stand out and identify with their group.
*   **B: uniharu wariparika sabaijanako wicharharu anukulan garera (conforming to the ideas of everyone around them):** This also contradicts the nature of subcultures, which often have distinct beliefs and practices that differ from mainstream society.
*   **C: samajik mapdandaharu swikar garera (accepting social norms):** Subcultures often challenge or redefine existing social norms."

"anuchhedko anusar, nimna madhey kun kura ma ek balakko jatiya rudhiwadi dharanako gyanley asar garna sakchha?","The correct answer is **B: uniharuko vyavahar (their behavior)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that ethnic stereotypes affect behavior (""yea jatiya rudhiwadiharule wyawaharlai asar gardacha""). The example given is that children who become aware of negative stereotypes associated with their ethnicity might perform poorly in school. This directly shows the impact on their behavior (school performance).

The other options are not as directly supported by the passage:

*   **A: uuniharuley pahichan garna rojeko jatiya alpasankhyak sanga (With the ethnic minority they choose to identify):** While related, the passage focuses on how *knowledge of* stereotypes affects behavior, not which group they choose to identify with.
*   **C: anya bachchaharu sangako sambandha (Relationship with other children):** The passage doesn't directly address how the stereotypes affect their relationships with other children, though it is a possible consequence.
*   **D: uniharuko jaatko paribhasha (Definition of their caste):** The passage focuses on the *impact* of stereotypes, not how they redefine their caste identity itself."

"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun kura le bachchaharuma asabhya vyavahar ko varnan garchha?","The correct answer is **B: asabhya vyavahar samajik ghulmilko kamibata utpanna huna sakchha**

Here's why:

*   The paragraph explicitly states that one common way to highlight the importance of socialization is by examining the unfortunate cases of children who, as they grow up, haven't been socialized by adults and have faced neglect, abuse, or arbitrary ill-treatment. These children are often labeled as ""feral"" or wild. This directly implies that a lack of proper socialization leads to this ""feral"" behavior.
*   The paragraph also discusses different reasons for the children not being socialized: parental neglect, severe abuse, or abandonment. All of these contribute to a lack of social interaction and proper upbringing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: adhikamsha asabhya vyavahar sharirik kharabiko karanley hunchha:** The paragraph mentions physical impairments, but only in the context of parents rejecting a child because of severe mental or physical disabilities. It doesn't say that most feral behavior is caused by physical ailments.
*   **C: asabhya vyavahar keval uniharuko abhibhawakley thunera rakheka bachchaharu ma prabal chha:** While some feral children are confined by their parents, the paragraph also discusses other cases like those raised by animals or living alone in the wild. So, confinement is not the *only* cause.
*   **D: sabai asabhya vyavahar dherai maanasik apangata le garda hunchha:** The passage doesn't explicitly say that ALL feral behavior is due to mental disabilities. It mentions it as one of the potential reasons for abandonment/neglect.
"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun chalan nirvahamukhi krishisanga mildojuldo chaina?","The passage states that Jeevan Krishi/ निर्वहामुखी कृषि (subsistence farming) focuses on:

*   Meeting the needs of the farmer and their family.
*   Being simple and often organic.
*   Using local seeds and ecologically sound practices.
*   Simple technologies for maximum yield.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: krishakko parivarko awashyaktalai pura garney ubjai dhyan kendrit garne (कृषकको परिवारको आवश्यकतालाई पुरा गर्ने उब्जाई ध्यान केन्द्रित गर्ने) - Focusing on yields to meet the farmer's family needs:** This aligns with the passage's description of subsistence farming.
*   **B: arulai bechna khaneykura utpadan garnu (अरुलाई बेच्न खानेकुरा उत्पादन गर्नु) - Producing food to sell to others:** This contradicts the core principle of subsistence farming, which is about meeting the farmer's *own* needs, not selling to others.
*   **C: vikashit tarikako sato dherai ubjani maa dhyan kendrit garney (विकसित तारिकाको सटो धेरै उब्जनीमा ध्यान केन्द्रित गर्ने) - Focusing on high yields instead of developed methods:** Subsistence farming uses simple methods and technologies, but the purpose is still high yields. It also mentions that it uses simple technologies to maximize the yield.
*   **D: krishakko kshetrako local beejharu prayog garnu (कृषकको क्षेत्रको लोकल बीउहरु प्रयोग गर्नु) - Using local seeds from the farmer's area:** This is explicitly mentioned as a characteristic of subsistence farming.

Therefore, the practice that does **not** align with subsistence farming is producing food to sell to others.

**Correct Answer: B**

"
sangralay ko bhraman paryatan ko kun shreni maa parchha?,"The correct answer is **C: sanskritik paryatan**.

The passage states that when someone visits a place to learn about its history and culture, it is called cultural tourism. Visiting a museum falls under this category as museums showcase history, art, and culture.
"
"anuchhedko anusar, manorajnako lagi yatra garneyharuko prathamikta ma ke huna sakcha?","The correct answer is **B: uniharuko dainiki bata chutti linu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kunai tyasto awasthama wyakti ek sthanma janchhan june aaram lynn ra ramailoka lagi hunchha june uniharuko niyamit dainik jiwanbhanda bhanda farak hunchha."" This translates to ""In such a situation, a person goes to a place that is for relaxation and fun which is different from their regular daily life.""

Therefore, the primary motivation for recreational tourists is to take a break from their daily routine. The other options relate to cultural tourism, not recreational tourism.
"
anuchhed anusar kun kura le local churchbhitra dar kam garna maddat garyo?,"The correct answer is **A: safal udayamshil vyavahar ko samjhna garera**

The passage states: ""Yass ghatanama, pahileka udyamashil wyawaharka udaharanharu ra tinka safal parinamharu smaran garnale manisharulai naya pariwartanprati ra sthaniya charchaka lagi naya nirdeshan prati khula hoon sahayog purryayo. Yasta safaltaka kathaharule bhawishyako pariwartantarfa sakaratmak jhukawa sirjana gardai pariwartanko darlai come garae."" This translates to: ""In this event, remembering the examples of past entrepreneurial behavior and their successful outcomes helped people to be open to new changes and new directions for the local church. Such success stories created a positive inclination towards future change, reducing the fear of change.""

Therefore, remembering successful entrepreneurial behaviors helped to reduce fear within the local church.
"
"anuchhed anusar, afno itihas bujhnaley ke kurama maddat garna sakchha?","Correct answer is **C: sangathanbhitra thau fela pareko anubhav diyera.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Kasaiko itihas bujhda sanskriti bujhieko manindaina, yasale kamtima manislai sangathanko itihasabhitra uniharu kahan chuke bhane bodh hasil garna maddat garchha."" This translates to: ""Understanding someone's history is like understanding the culture, at the very least, it helps people realize where they fit within the organization's history."" This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: pariwartan sambandhi dar ghatayera (reducing the fear of change)** While the passage mentions that recalling past successes helps reduce the fear of change, the primary benefit of understanding one's history is understanding their place within the organization's history, as stated in the passage. So it is an indirect result of understanding one's history, not the direct benefit.

*   **B: manyataharu laai ajha baliyo banayera (strengthening beliefs)** The passage does not directly say that understanding one's history strengthens beliefs.

*   **D: udayamshil vyavaharma sudhar lyayera (improving entrepreneurial behavior)** While the passage mentions examples of past entrepreneurial behavior encouraging new changes, it doesn't say that understanding one's history *directly* improves entrepreneurial behavior.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the paragraph."
nimna madhey kun kathanley sikaiko pachhilo adhunik drishtikonlai sahi tarikaley warnan gardachha?,"The correct answer is **D: sikaima kunai kura nirapekshya hudaina (nothing is absolute in learning)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes that learning happens through the experience between the learner and the knowledge presented. It argues against the idea of a ""best"" way to learn because learning is subjective and based on individual experiences. The passage then gives an example of watching a TV show about renovation projects that many viewers don't actually participate in or apply, which illustrates that people won't necessarily experience transformative learning just from watching that TV program. This directly supports option D, which states that nothing is absolute in learning because learning is an individual and subjective experience.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: kehi sikaai anubhavharu anya bhanda faidajank hunchhan (some learning experiences are more beneficial than others)**: The passage argues against this, stating there isn't a single ""good"" way to learn. This option contradicts this.
*   **B: sikai hamiley anubhav garney bishwas lageko kuraharuma kendrit hunuparchaa (learning should be focused on things we believe we will experience)**: While experience is important, the passage doesn't say learning *should* be focused on things we expect to experience. It points out that we learn from experiences *even if* we don't directly apply or participate in them.
*   **C: kunai tarikaharu anya bhanda ramro hunchhan (some methods are better than others)**: The passage directly contradicts this by stating there is no single ""good"" way to learn."
nimna madhey kun kathanley sikaaiko pachhilo adhunik drishtikonlai sahi tarikaley jhalkaudaina?,"The passage argues that learning happens in the *experience* between the learner and the presented knowledge. It uses the example of watching educational TV shows to illustrate this.  Even if we never actively participate in the activities we see on TV, we still gain knowledge.

Let's examine the answer choices:

*   **A: jankari line dherai tarikaharu hunchhan (There are many ways to gain information)** - This aligns with the passage's implication that watching TV is one way to learn.

*   **B: kunai bishesh sikai anubhavharulai anya bhanda badhi mahatwa dinuparcha (Certain learning experiences should be given more importance than others)** -  The passage *doesn't* say that some learning experiences are better than others. It simply states that learning *happens through experience*.  This is the opposite of the passage's point, which is that even passive experiences (like watching TV) can lead to learning.

*   **C: sikaiko anubhavharu sikney ra prastut gyanma nirbhar hunchha (Learning experiences depend on learning and presented knowledge)** - This directly reflects the central argument of the passage: learning is an experience *between* the learner and the information.

*   **D: hamiley kahiley pani prayog nagarney gyan pani sikna yogya hunchha (Knowledge that we may never use is also worth learning)** - This is supported by the TV show example; we might learn about building a garbage incinerator in our backyard, but never actually do it.

Therefore, the statement that *doesn't* accurately reflect the passage's perspective on modern approaches to learning is **B**.

The passage states that virtual teams are viewed as having the *same* levels of excellence as traditional teams. This means that both types of teams are expected to perform at a high standard.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: duwai toliharusanga uniharuko dainiki maa bhinna starko swatantrata hunchha** (Both teams have different levels of independence in their daily lives): The passage implies that virtual teams *tend* to have more independence than traditional teams due to different time zones, but it doesn't say that both have *different* levels.
*   **C: duwai toliharuley adrishya vyavasthapan tolilai report gardachan** (Both teams report to an invisible management team): Only virtual teams report to the ""invisible team.""
*   **D: duwai toliharuley eutai samaya kshetrama karya gardachan** (Both teams work in the same time zone): The passage actually mentions that virtual teams might work in different time zones, implying traditional teams likely work in the same one."
"anuchhedma adharit, paramparagat ra virtual toliharu barey kun kathan sahi hoina?","The correct answer is **A: paramparagat tolilai praya: mathillo starma rakhichha**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""Virtual toliharulai paramparagat toliharuko jastai utkrishtataka starharu bhaeko rupma liinchha"". This means virtual teams are considered to have similar levels of excellence as traditional teams, not that traditional teams are always considered superior.
*   The other options are all supported by the text:

This translates to: ""As lens manufacturers have achieved higher quality in lens production, this problem is decreasing. This allows zoom lenses to produce comparable quality pictures to lenses with fixed focal lengths.""

Therefore, option C is the best answer as it directly reflects the improvement in zoom lens quality due to better manufacturing.

nimna madhey kun rahasyawadko sahi varnan manindaina?,"The correct answer is **D: pratakshya vyaktigat anubhav khojnu ma jod dherai anya dharmik vishvash ra aradhanasanga dajna sakincha.**

(Mysticism can be distinguished from other religious beliefs and worship, especially those of a peaceful, introspective, blissful or ecstatic character, by linking it to the direct personal experience of a specific state of consciousness.)

The other options are accurate descriptions of mysticism based on the provided text."

dekhney khubi ke ma nirbhar chha?,"The best answer based on the provided text is **A: drishya pranali sanwedanashik ang**.

Here's why:

* The first sentence of the text directly states that ""Drishti wa herne kshamata drishya pranali sanwedanashik ang wa ankhama nirbhar garchha"" which translates to ""Vision or the ability to see depends on the visual system, sensory organs and the eye.""
* While the other options (B, C, and D) are factors that *affect* vision or the *capabilities* of the eye, the core, most fundamental thing that vision *depends on* is the visual system/sensory organs.

Therefore, A is the most direct and accurate answer to the question ""dekhney khubi ke ma nirbhar chha?"" (what does the ability to see depend on?).
"

The passage states: ""Jiwako awashyaktama nirbhar bhaera aankha ekbhanda dherai nirmanharu hune garchhan."" which translates to ""Depending on the needs of the organism, eyes can have more than one structure."" This directly answers the question of what the differences in eyes between organisms depend on.

While A, C, and D are mentioned as factors related to eye structure and function, the *primary* driver of the *differences* in eye structure between organisms, according to the passage, is the needs of the organism.
"
"anuchhed anusar, sikh sambadhi kun kathanley tyas dharmalai sahi tarikaley darshaudaina?","Correct Answer: **B: guru sikhsangako matra anupam adhar ho**

*   **P: ""Sikh bharatiya upamahadwipbata aeko ek dharma ho. yo 15 aun shatabdima punjab kshetrama hindu paramparabhitra raheko sampradayik vibhajanko karan suru bhaeko ho.**"" - This statement aligns with option A.
*   **P: ""guru sabai bharatiya dharmaharuka lagi ek adharbhut paksh ho tar sikh dharma ek mahatwako rupma lieko cha jasle sikh wishwasharuko mull roop banaunchha.""** - This statement directly contradicts option B. The passage clarifies that the Guru is a fundamental aspect of all Indian religions, not just Sikhism. While Sikhism places great emphasis on the Guru, it's not unique to Sikhism.
*   **P: ""Yo dharmako sthapana 15 aun shatabdima guru nanak (1469-1539) dwara bhaeko thiyo. yasama aru nau guruharu uttaradhikarko rupma rahe.""** - This confirms that nine Gurus followed Guru Nanak, which agrees with option C.
*   **P: ""Yadyapi uniharule yasalai hindu mull ra paramparalai swikar gareta pani sikhharule afno asthalai hindu dharmabhanda farak manchan.""** - This statement aligns with option D that some Sikh traditions are linked to Hinduism.

Therefore, option B is the statement that is NOT accurately portrayed in the passage."
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun sikh dharma pranaliko mul swarup manincha?","The correct answer is **A: guruko awadharana**.

The passage states: ""guru sabai bharatiya dharmaharuka lagi ek adharbhut paksh ho tar sikh dharma ek mahatwako rupma lieko cha jasle sikh wishwasharuko mull roop banaunchha.""  This directly translates to: ""guru is a fundamental aspect for all Indian religions but Sikhism takes it as an importance that forms the core of Sikh beliefs.""

"anuchhed anusar, dhyan kami hune gadbadi vayeka bachchaharulai ke kurama dhyan kendrit garna gahro huncha?","The correct answer is **A: vidalaya karya**.

"
"anuchhed anusar, dhyan kami hune gadbadi vayeka bachchaharu kina jokhimpurna vyavahar garney gardachhan?","The correct answer is **D: uniharuko dimaglai uttejit garna.**

"
"anuchhedma bhayeko jankariko adharma, nimna madhye kun machanko udharharan hoina?","The correct answer is **C: euta swatantra aadhayan karyakram (a self-study program)**.

Here's why:

*   **Machan (Scaffolding)**, as explained in the passage, is a support system provided to learners during a new learning experience. It's a temporary aid to help them overcome challenges and develop understanding.

Let's look at why the other options *are* examples of scaffolding:

*   **A: computer khelko suruwatma bhayeko sikaai (Learning at the start of a computer game):** Many computer games have tutorial levels or help systems that guide players when they first begin.
*   **B: SAT prashikshak (SAT tutor):** An SAT tutor provides direct instruction, guidance, and support to help students prepare for the SAT exam.
*   **D: euta sano league prashikshak (A little league coach):** A little league coach helps players learn the sport, develop skills, and understand the rules of the game.

**Why a self-study program is NOT scaffolding:**

*   A self-study program is designed for independent learning. It lacks the direct, personalized support and guidance that are hallmarks of scaffolding. While a self-study program might contain materials for learning, it does not involve another person acting as a support to scaffold the learner.
"
nimna madhey kunley machanko avadharanalai sahi tarikaley varnan gardaina?,"Correct answer is **C: yeslai paryiyojanama adharit sikai pani vanincha**

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** The passage emphasizes that scaffolding is *distinct* from project-based learning (""Jabki pariyojanama adharit shikshale sikna sajilo ra adhik chakhalagdo banaunu parchha, jasle machan ek kadam aghadi janchha.""). It describes scaffolding as something that *supports* learning experiences, including project-based learning, but it isn't the same thing.

The other options are correct according to the passage:

*   **A: machan virtually awasthit huna sakcha**: The passage mentions virtual scaffolds (""Virtual scaffolds suftwearma antarikaran garieko cha"").
*   **B: yo sikney vidhi bhanda pani dherai sahayata ho**: The passage explicitly states scaffolding is a support mechanism, not a teaching method (""Machan sikaiko vidhibhanda bhanda baru ek sahayata ho"").
*   **D: machanlai sikai anubhavko suruwatma samarthan pradhan garnakolagi prayog garincha**: The passage describes scaffolding's use at the beginning of a new learning experience (""...jo naya sikaiko anubhawabata gujariraheka hunchhan jasto key naya computer karyakram wa naya pariyojanako suruwatma hunchhan."")."
"Anuchhed anusar texas kaa nagarik lai sambodhan garda, governor le kasto aashwasana dienan?","The correct answer is **D: visaya gambhir chhaina**.

Here's why:

*   **P clearly states:** ""yo mamla gambhir cha"" (this matter is serious).
*   Therefore, the governor *did not* assure the citizens that the issue was not serious. He said the opposite.

Let's analyze the other options:

*   **B: Janata ko suraksha ko laagi kadam haru chalieka chhan** (Steps are being taken for the safety of the public) - This is mentioned in the first sentence.
*   **C: Uniharu chunauti ko saamana garna susajjit chhan** (They are equipped to face the challenge) - The governor specifically mentions ""vishwaka kehi sthanharu ramra chan"" to face the challenge.
*   **A: Pranali le ramrari kaam gareko chhaina** (The system is not working properly) - The governor implies that the system *is* working as it should by saying, ""nishchinta hunuhos key hamro pranali tyahi tarahako cam gariraheko cha jun yasale garnupardacha."" (rest assured that our system is working in the same way as it should)"
UW kaa dui purva vidhyarthi le samachar ko parody garne kun karyakram ko nirman gare?,"The correct answer is **D: The Onion**.

The passage states that Dheraiaghi da deli sho ra da colbert report, heck ra jonasanle 1988 maa uniharu UW maa vidyarthi hunda samachar ra samachar reportingko anukaran gurney prakashanko kalpana gare. Yasako sthapana pachhi, onion mudran sanskaranko sathama, ek yathartha samachar parody samrajya baneko cha.

This translates to: ""Dheraiaghi da deli sho ra da colbert report, Heck and Jonasan conceived of a publication that imitated news and news reporting when they were students at UW in 1988. After its founding, The Onion, along with its print editions, became a true news parody empire.""

Therefore, The Onion is the program they created.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, yea madhye kun the onion ko samachar parody garne samrajya maa samawesh thiena?","The correct answer is **B: Chalchitra**

The passage mentions the following as part of The Onion's news parody empire:

*   Print editions
*   Website
*   Personalized advertisements
*   24-hour news network
*   Podcasts
*   *Our Dumb World* (referred to as world atlas in the passage)

The passage does not mention movies/films. Therefore, the answer is chalchitra.
"

The passage clearly states, ""Pradhanmantriko adhikarik niwassthan, downing stritma praharidwara sanrakshit praeshdwarko viparit raheko whitehalma..."" which translates to ""In Whitehall, opposite the Downing Street entrance protected by police..."" This indicates that the police were guarding the entrance to Downing Street.
"
Sawari chap huna nadina prahari le kati bela pradarshankaari haru laai aghi badhna bhaneko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: 11:20 baje**.

The passage states that at 11:20, the police requested the protestors to move off the road because traffic was building up.
"
Dr. Ehud Ur le gareko anusandhan bare ke sahi ho?,"The correct answer is **B: Agadi daibetes bhaeka musa laai aba daibetes chaina**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Dr. Ehud Ur's research involves mice that have had diabetes for 4 months.
*   The passage does not state that Dr. Ur's research is beneficial to people with type 1 diabetes.
*   Dr. Ur is skeptical about the results being curative of diabetes
*   The passage does not state that diabetes has been induced in mice that did not previously have it."
"Anuchhed anusar, Dr. Ur lai ke maa sankaa chha?","The correct answer is **B: Yadi upachar sambhav chha**.

The passage states that Dr. Ur is ""शंकास्पद (shankaspad)"" which translates to skeptical or doubtful about ""मधुमेह निको हुन सक्छ कि (madhumeha niko hun sakcha ki)"", which translates to whether diabetes can be cured. This directly implies he is doubtful about whether a cure (उपचार - upachar) is possible.
"
Flight CG4684 ko durghatana baare kun wakyale sahi rupmaa varnan gardaina?,"The correct answer is **C: Plane le durghatana hunu aghi tin patak awataran garne prayas gareko thiyo.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the plane attempted to land twice (""anusar hijo winter kokodama awataran gurney prayas gardai thiyo, tar phile nai ekpatak rokieko thiyo. Dosro patak awataran gurney prayas garnuparne samayabhanda jhandai dash minetaghi yo vimaan harayo""). It did not attempt to land three times.
*   The other options are all true based on the passage:
    *   A: Plane mausam ko karanle awataran garna asafal bhaeko thiyo - The passage mentions bad weather causing the forced landing.
    *   B: Plane nikai durgam sthal maa durghatana bhaeko thiyo - The passage states the crash site was difficult to reach.
    *   D: Plane durghatana bhaeko sthaan ko khoji karya lai mausam le asar gareko thiyo - The passage says the search was hampered by the same bad weather."
Flight CG4684 ko awataran ke karan le rokiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Mausam ko awastha kharab thiyo (The weather conditions were bad).**

The passage states ""tar phile nai ekpatak rokieko thiyo,"" which means it was stopped once before. Then it says ""...tyahi kharab mausamko karanle akal awataran garaeko thiyo,"" indicating the bad weather caused the forced landing.

Ushna pradeshiya toofan danielle ko asar mapan garna kina chunautipurna chha?,"The correct answer is **C: Toofan landfall bata tadha chha**.

The passage states: ""Sanyukta rajya america wa caribeanma andhibehari pahirobata tadha bhaekale sambhawit prabhawa aklan garna gahro bhaeko cha."" This translates to: ""Because the hurricane is far from landfall in the United States or the Caribbean, it is difficult to assess the potential impact.""
"
Anuchhed anusar tala dieko madhye kun wakya ushna pradeshiya toofan danielle ko baare sahi hoina?,"The correct answer is **D: Yo landfall sanga najik chha**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the hurricane is about 3,000 miles away from Miami, Florida. 3000 miles is quite far, so it is definitely NOT near landfall.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: Caribbean maa yasko asar baare jankaari chhaina**: The passage says ""Sanyukta rajya america wa caribeanma andhibehari pahirobata tadha bhaekale sambhawit prabhawa aklan garna gahro bhaeko cha."", indicating that assessing the potential impact on the Caribbean is difficult, which is similar to the statement.
*   **B: Yo atlantic mahasagar maa baneko thiyo**: The passage explicitly states that Hurricane Danielle formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
*   **C: Yo andhi maa parinat huna sakchha**: The passage says National Hurricane Center scientists predict Danielle will strengthen by Wednesday."
"Anuchhed anusar,vishwawyapi mahamari bannu aghi rog laai ke hunu parne sujhaav garieko chha?","Paragraph anusar, vishwawyapi mahamari bannu aghi rog laai **A: Yo kam ghatak bannu parchha** hunu parne sujhaav garieko chha.

Therefore, the answer is **A**.
"
Anuchhed anusar fujian bata andhi kati tadha thiyo?,"The correct answer is **C: 70 kilometer**.

The passage states: ""August 9 co ratisamma morakotko aankha chiniyan pranta fujianbata kariva sattari kilometer tadha thiyo."" which translates to ""By the night of August 9th, the eye of Morakot was about seventy kilometers away from the Chinese province of Fujian.""
"
George w bush asia aaipugda kasle swagat gare?,"The correct answer is **D: Upa-pradhanmantri**

The passage states: ""Unlai singapurka **upapradhanmantri Wong Kan Sengley** swagat gare..."" which translates to ""He was welcomed by **the Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng** of Singapore...""
"
Rashtrapati le asia ko wyapar wista bare kahile bole?,"The passage states: ""Madhyawadhi chunawama hareko ek satapachhi busle ek darshaklai asiako wyaparka wistarko barema batae."" This translates to ""One week after losing the midterm elections, Bush told an audience about Asia's trade expansion.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Madhyavadhi chunawama hare pachhi (After losing the midterm elections)**.
"
Anuchhed anusar tala die madhye kun sarkar ko samgra laxya ho?,"The correct answer is **D: Dhuwani ko bhid ghataune (Reducing pollution)**

Here's why:

* **P states:** Ajko ghoshanale yass warshako marchma sarkarko koshlai thap sahayog gurney pratibadhatalai pani wistar garyo. Thap 300 ley badhi bhidbhadbata chhutkara paunaka lagi cool 1300 dhuwani sadhana lyaundachha.
    * This translates to: Today's announcement also extended the government's commitment to further support the treasury by March of this year. An additional 1300 pollution control devices will be brought in to relieve overcrowding by an additional 300.
* The main purpose of bringing in the additional pollution control devices is explicitly stated as ""badhi bhidbhadbata chhutkara paunaka lagi"" which means ""to relieve overcrowding."" In this context, ""overcrowding"" is referring to air overcrowding/pollution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yo varsha ko march samma maa dhuwani maa thap lagaani garne (To invest more in pollution by March of this year):** The sentence states the goverment is investing in measures to curb pollution, not to invest more in pollution.
*   **B: Kul 300 dhuwani lyaune (Bringing in a total of 300 pollution):** The statement says additional 300 will be brought to relieve overcrowding, not pollution.
*   **C: Thap 1300 dhuwani lyaune (Bringing in an additional 1300 pollution):** The statement says an additional 1300 pollution control devices will be brought in.

Therefore, the overarching goal is to reduce pollution."
Sarkar le ke ghosana garyo?,"The best answer is **C: Uniharu ko thap 1300 dhuwani maa lagani garne yojana chha**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Ajko ghoshanale yass warshako marchma sarkarko koshlai thap sahayog gurney pratibadhatalai pani wistar garyo. Thap 300 ley badhi bhidbhadbata chhutkara paunaka lagi cool **1300 dhuwani sadhana** lyaundachha."" This directly translates to: ""Today's announcement also extended the government's commitment to further support the treasury in March this year. In addition to 300, cool **1300 sound devices** will be brought in to get rid of the increased congestion.""

The passage clearly mentions the government plans to bring 1300 ""dhuwani sadhana"" (sound devices).

Let's look at why the other options aren't as good:

*   A: Uniharu ko aru thap 300 dhuwani maa lagani garne yojana chha (They plan to invest in another 300 sound devices). While the passage mentions an additional 300, the main point is the 1300.
*   B: Uniharu dhuwani ko samasya kam garna pratibada chhan (They are committed to reducing the problem of sound). While implied, it's not the direct announcement.
*   D: Bhid ko samasya march samma maa hal hune chha (The problem of congestion will be solved by March). The passage mentions March in relation to the treasury support commitment, not necessarily solving the congestion problem."
Anuchhed anusar ke jankari thaha chha?,"The correct answer is **A: Jokhim ko star ghateko chha**

Here's why:

*   **P** states that there's no intelligence suggesting an imminent attack *but* the lowered threat level doesn't mean *all* threats have disappeared.
*   **Q** asks what we *know* from the passage.
*   Option A aligns with the information that ""gambhir khatarako star ghatnuko"" meaning ""the level of serious threat has decreased"".
* Option B is incorrect, because ""the lowered threat level doesn't mean *all* threats have disappeared.""
* Option C is incorrect, because ""tyahan kunai akraman tatkal hune walla cha bhane sujhawa dine kunai baudhik jankari chhaina.""
* Option D is incorrect, because ""tyahan kunai akraman tatkal hune walla cha bhane sujhawa dine kunai baudhik jankari chhaina.""

Therefore, Option A is correct."
Pradarshan sambandhi kun wakya sahi hoina?,"The correct answer is **C: Pradarshankari haru le yas aghiko CEP ko rajinama mag gare**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to lead the country towards new elections. It does not say that the protesters demanded the previous CEP's resignation.
*   Options A, B, and D are all supported by information in the passage.
    *   A: The presidential commission was a response to the demonstrations.
    *   B: Delayed elections triggered the protests.
    *   D: Some of the protests turned violent.

Pachhillo CEP le rajinama dinu parne kasle sujhaae?,"The passage states: ""Gaeko mahina rashtrapatiya ayogle deshlai naya chunawatira laijane upayako packageko rupma aghillo CEP ko rajinama sifaris gareko thiyo.""

This translates to: ""Last month the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to take the country towards new elections.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Rashtrapatiya aayog** (Presidential Commission).
"
Anucched anusar USA gyamnastics nassar dwaara kheladi ko durvyavahaar pachhi ke ko samarthan gardaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Vighatan (Disintegration)**.

The passage states: ""Hammy USOC ko kathansanga sahamat chhaun key wighatan bhanda baru hamra athlete ra clubharuko hit ra tiniharuko khel sayed hamro sangha bhitra arthapurna pariwartanko sath aghi badhera ajha ramro sewa dina sakinchha.""  This clearly indicates that USA Gymnastics, aligned with the USOC's statement, is *against* disintegration and believes in moving forward with meaningful changes within the organization to better serve the athletes and clubs.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, agadi badhda USA gymnastics ra sanyukta rajya america olympic samiti ko pramukh laxya ke ho?","The correct answer is **D: Kheladika lagi surakshit watawaran ko pravardhan garne (Promoting a safe environment for athletes)**

The passage explicitly states that both USA Gymnastics and USOC share the same goal: ""USA gymnastic ra USOC co eutai lakshya cha: kheladiharu surakshit, sakaratmak ra sashakta watawaranma khelera afno sapana sakar gurney dishatarfa aghi badhna sakun bhanera gymnastic ra any khelharu sakdo surakshit banaune.""
"
Durghatana huda jahaz kata jadai thiyo? ,"Correct answer is **C: Palawan**

The passage states ""Avenger class mine countermises jahaz palawan porto princessaka lagi yatrama gairaheko thiyo"" which translates to ""Avenger class mine countermeasures ship was traveling to Palawan Puerto Princesa.""
"
Anuchhed maa ullekh bhaeko jahaz baare ke sahi hoina?,"Sahi uttar ho: **B: yo palawan maa aadharit thiyo**

Anuchhedle batauncha ki jahaz palawan tira yatrama thiyo, palawan maa aadharit thiyena. Anuchhedle yo pani batauncha ki jahaz americi nausenako sataun fleet sanga sambandhit chha ra yo mine countermeasures jahaz ho ra puerto princesa tira jaadai thiyo.
"
Kasle americi sena sambandhi vigyapti die?,"Correct Answer: D
"
Anuchhed anunsar kun desh le bandi ladaku lai surakshya dine jimewari liyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Turkey**.

The paragraph states that Turkey will also take responsibility for securing ISIS fighters who have been captured.
"
Durghatana ko kaaran ke ho bhanne anumaan gariyo?,"The correct answer is **B: Pratikul aago** (Hostile fire).

The passage states: ""yo shatrutapurna agoko parinamswarup bhaeko vishwas garinchha"" which translates to ""it is believed that it was a result of hostile fire.""
"
Durghatana kasto bhubhaag maa bhayo?,"The correct answer is **B: Aftyaaro** and **D: Himali**.

The passage states ""Durghatana uccha himali ilakama bhayo ra..."". This translates to ""The accident happened in a high mountainous area...""
The passage also states ""Durghatana hune kshetraka lagi khoji garna prayas garda kharab mausam ra **apthyaro bhu-bhag** bhetinchha."" This translates to ""...attempts to search the accident area are met with bad weather and **difficult terrain**.""
So both **Aftyaaro** and **Himali** are correct.
"
Adhikaariharule badhi ko karan le ke hune aash garekaa chhan?,"The correct answer is **A: Sandabar ko punarsthapana** (Sandbar restoration).

The passage states that the authorities hoped the flood would be enough to break through the sandbar dam (""baluwaka barko bandha bhatkaunaka lagi paryapta hunechha""). This implies their goal was to restore the sandbar.
"
Baadh ko nirman le ke laai sthai rupmaa asar garyo?,"Correct answer is **C: Jungli wanyajantu ko vasthan**.

**Reasoning:**

The passage states that the dam stopped seasonal floods which spread different substances throughout the river. These floods were necessary for the creation of sandbars and coastlines, which served as wildlife habitat. As a result of the dam, two fish species are extinct and two more, including the humpback chub, are endangered. This clearly indicates that the dam's construction has permanently affected the wildlife habitat.

While sandbars (A) are affected, the primary issue highlighted is the disruption to the *habitat* provided by those sandbars and coastlines. The humpback chubs (B) are negatively impacted, but the question asks what was permanently affected, and the affected habitat is a more encompassing and permanent impact. Material dispersal (D) was affected, but again, the consequence of that effect is habitat loss, making (C) the most appropriate and accurate answer.
"
Anuchhed anusar sanyukta rajya america lai kasle sambhavit aakraman baare suchana diyo?,"The correct answer is **C: Naknhulaaieko srot** (An unknown source).

The passage states: ""Yu.ess. bhancha, usale ek agyat srotabata jankari prapta gareko cha..."" which translates to ""The US says, it has received information from an unknown source...""
"

Bharat le kati wicket gumaayo?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

The passage states: ""Tar kaptanko wicket gumaepachhi bharatle 7 wicket gumaera 36 run matri banayo."" which translates to ""But after losing the captain's wicket, India lost 7 wickets and only scored 36 runs.""
"
Anucched anusaar innings ko uccha score kati thiyo?,"The correct answer is **A: 70 run**.

The passage states, ""Robin Uthappale 11 chauka ra 2 chakka hanera matra 41 balma 70 run banaundai inningko uchchatam anka banae."" This translates to ""Robin Uthappa scored the highest score of the innings by scoring 70 runs off 41 balls with 11 fours and 2 sixes.""
"
Tala die madhye kun Adam cuerden ko nirasha ko karan hoina?,"Prashna anusar, Adam Cuerdenko nirasha ko karan Wells (Wales) le gareko jhuta boli ra kala metaune bareko bahana ho. Yasaile, sahi uttar C hunchha, ""Wales le kura nasunnu,"" yo nirasha ko sidha karan hoina, balki kala metaune kramama gareko bahana matra ho.
"
Anuchhed anusar site bata ke hataieko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: youn samagri**.

The passage mentions ""Samudayako jalanle siteka lagi youn samagrika barema niti nirman garna halka prayasharu nimtyayo"" which translates to ""Community anger prompted minor efforts to create a policy about pornography for the site."" This indicates the community was upset about pornographic content on the site. Though the passage doesn't explicitly state that pornographic materials were completely ""removed"", the context clearly implies the community's desire for a policy to deal with them because of the issues they raised. Thus, it is the most logical answer.
"
Anuchhed anusar tala die madhye amir khan le kun kurako samarthan gardainan?,"The passage states that Amir Khan believes ""Mahilaile jhagada garnu hundaina"" which translates to ""Women shouldn't fight/compete"". This directly opposes the inclusion of women athletes in the Olympics.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Olympic maa mahila kheladi lai samawesh garne** (Including female athletes in the Olympics)
"
Anuchhed anusar amir khan le aafno vyaktigat vichar kaa vabjud kun kura ko samarthan garne chhan?,"Correct answer is **C: 2012 ko olympic**.

The passage states that despite his personal views (""malai mahilale jhagada garnu hundaina bhane lagchha""), Amir Khan said he would support a British competitor at the 2012 London Olympics. This indicates his support for the 2012 Olympics, irrespective of his personal beliefs."
Peter Lenz ko mrityu kahile bhayo?,"Correct answer is C: Aspatalma (Hospital).

The passage states: ""...ek sthaniya aspatalma lagiyo jahaan pachhi unko mrityu bhayo."" (He was taken to a local hospital where he later died.)
"
Xavier Zayat ko hun?,"Sahi uttar B ho: Arko dhawak.

Paragraphma spashta roopma ullekh gariyeko chha ki Javier Zayat, Lenzlai hanne ""racer saathi"" thiyo, jaba Lenz afno bike bata khasyo. Isliye, vo ek dhawak thiyo."
Kun awasthama ek daraeko hawaai yaatru le hawai jahaz ko bhitri jankaari faidajanak hunchha?,"Sahi uttar B ho: ""Yadi hawai yatra namanparaune karan agyat ko dar ho.""

Vyakhya: Paragraph P spasht ruple bataunchha ki hawaai jahazle kasari cam garchha ra udanko samayama key hunchha bhanne barema jannale agyat wa niyantranma nahunema adharit darko samadhan garna sakincha. Yadi kunai yaatrule agyat bhayako karanle hawai yatra namanparaudaina bhane, hawaai jahaz ko kaamkaaj ko barema siknule unko darlai kam garna madad garnasakchha."
Anuchhed anusar mulya bare sachet yatri le kun kura antim maa garchan?,"Correct answer is **D: wayusewa ko website check garne**.

**Explanation:**

The passage states that price-conscious travelers often book flights through online travel agencies to compare prices. However, sometimes different aggregators show different prices for the same flight, so they also pay to check the airline's website directly **before comparing search results and booking.**

Therefore, the final step a price-conscious traveler does, according to the passage, is checking the airline's website.
"
Anuchhed anusar yaatru harule hawai yatra ko sabai bhanda raamro mulya prapta garna sabai bhanda pahile ke garnu parchha?,"The correct answer is **B: vibhinna ektrikarankarta ko mulya tulana garne.**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that different aggregators can have different prices for the same flight (""*uhi udanma vibhinna ektrikarankartama bhinna mulya hoon sakha*""). It also suggests the need to compare search results and check the airline's website before booking (""*khoj parinamharu tulana garna ra booking garnuaghi aafain wayusewako websitema hernka lagi pani bhuktani gardacha*"").

Let's look at why the other options are not the best:

*   **A: wayusewa ko website check garne**: While the passage mentions checking the airline's website, it suggests doing so *after* comparing search results from aggregators. The primary action for finding the best price is to compare prices from different sources first.
*   **C: wayusewa baata sidhai book garne**: Booking directly from the airline might sometimes be cheaper, but the passage doesn't indicate that it's always the *first* step or the best way to guarantee the lowest price.
*   **D: Travel agent sanga sidhai book garne**: The passage doesn't mention booking through a travel agent.
"
Kahile delivery sangai sahayatri ko awashyakta parchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Jaba saman hawai dhuwani marfat pathainchha**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""airlinesko niyamle tiniharulai yatrubina shaman pathauna anumati dindaina, jahanbhitra tapain aunuhunchha."" This directly translates to airlines' rules don't allow them to send goods without a passenger on flights that you're traveling on. Therefore, a companion (sahayatri) is needed when sending goods via air freight (hawai dhuwani marfat). The passage specifically mentions this restriction related to air travel. The other options aren't the primary reason for needing a companion.
"
Anuchhed anusar gathabandhan maa Frequen flyer wayusewa ko chanot garda kun kura lai prathamikta dinu parchha?,"Correct answer is **D: Aru suvidha thapna sakne wayusewa**.

**Explanation:**

The paragraph emphasizes that even though it might be tempting to choose a frequent flyer program from an airline you fly often (C), you should be aware of the different amenities offered (D) and the varying generosity of frequent flyer points across different airlines within the same alliance (A & B - indirectly touches upon). The core message is about being mindful of *suwidha* (amenities/benefits) and point systems, thus D is the closest and most relevant answer.
"
Annuchhed anusar kasle dherai flyer point dina sakchha?,"Pradan garieko annuchhed anusar, ekai sanstha bhitra ko bhinna vimaan sewa le tapainlai barambar udanka binduharu ajha udhar garai dina sakchha.

Tesaile, sahi uttar ho:

**D: Eutai gathabandhan ko bhinna wayusewa**
"
Anuchhed anusar madira badhi sewan garna le kun indriya lai hani garchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Herai (Herai)**.

The paragraph mentions that excessive alcohol consumption can lead to:

*   Liver damage
*   Blindness (Andhopana)
*   Death

Thus, it specifically mentions ""blindness"" (herai), which is related to sight."
Anuchhed maa ullekh bhaye anusar madirako kaharab asar lai ke le kam garna sakne sambhavana cha?,"Paragraph le madira seven garda hune khatra haru barema kura garchha, ra kati pahila sewan huna sakne ghatnaharuma kalejoko kshati, andhopana ra mrityusmet hoon sakchan bhanne barema pani ullekh garchha.

C: Thorai thorai garera madira sewan garda (Anuchhedmaa yasko barema sidhai ullekh gariekoin kinakina, thorai thorai piunaale khatra kam huna sakchha, tara yo prashnako lagi sabse relevant chaina.)
D: vibhinna manis sanga piudaa (Anuchhedmaa yasko barema kehi pani bhanieko chhaina.)

Tyasaile sahi jawab B ho."
Amsterdam maa sabai bhanda badhi ghar-jagga ko mulya kaha chha?,"P le canal jilla ko sampatti ko mulya desh ma sabaibhanda uccha cha bhanne spashta rupma bhancha. Atah, sahi answer A ho: Canal jilla.
"
Canal jilla lai kina UNESCO ko vishwa sampada suchi maa raakhieko chha?,"The correct answer is **A: Yasko aitihaasik ra sanskritik mahatwa ko karanle** (Because of its historical and cultural significance).

The passage explicitly states that the canal district was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site ""because of its unique cultural and historical significance.""  While the other options might be *true* of the canal district (it does have unique qualities, it is around the binnenstad, and it has high property values), the *reason* for the UNESCO designation is its historical and cultural importance.
"
Anuchhed anusar ke karan le phnom krom ko bhraman sarthak hunchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonle sap bata dekhine drishya**.

The passage states: ""Mandirko udas watawaran ra tonal sap talko drishyale pahadma chadhnu sarthak banaunchhan."" This translates to: ""The temple's somber atmosphere and the view of Tonle Sap Lake make the climb to the hill worthwhile.""
"
Anuchhed anusar phnom krom chirda aagantuk lai ke awashyak parchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Angkor pass paunu**.

The passage states: ""Tonele sapma jaanda angkor pass mandir praesh gurney hunale passport lyauna nabirsanu hola"" which translates to ""When going to Tonle Sap, you will need to pass through the Angkor Pass temple, so don't forget to bring your passport"". This implies you need the Angkor Pass to get to Tonle Sap, which is linked to the Phnom Krom visit in the context of the passage.
"
Anucched anusar tala die madhye ke le paryatak lai antarctica ko bhraman garna bata rokchha?,"Correct answer is **A: Thulo bhraman budget** and **D: Simit sharirik tandurusti**.

The passage explicitly states:

*   ""Paryatak bhraman mahango raheko cha"" - Tourist trips are expensive (implying **Thulo bhraman budget** is a constraint).
*   ""Sharirik tandurusti chahinchha"" - Physical fitness is required (implying **Simit sharirik tandurusti** is a barrier).

While the other options might influence *how* someone travels, only the cost and physical fitness are presented as outright barriers to *going* to Antarctica in the first place."
Parvatarohan maa ruchi rakhne paryatak le antartica ko kun bhag ma bhraman garla?,"The correct answer is **B: Bhitri bhag (Bhitri Bhag - Interior Part)**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Kahilekaahin visheshagya hawai turharu parwatarohanka lagi wa polma pugnaka lagibhitra janchhan, jasko thulo adhaar hunchha."" This translates to: ""Sometimes specialized aerial tours go inside for mountaineering or to reach the poles, which have large bases."" This directly links mountaineering with the interior of Antarctica. The other options are related to the more accessible and commonly visited areas near the coast.
"
Aadhunik samay agadi ko prayogshala kun sthan ma hune sambhavana chha?,"The passage states: ""Adhunik samayabhanda pahileka prayogashalaharu ... sheher wa campusharuma awasthit thee."" This translates to: ""Laboratories before modern times were located in cities or campuses."" Also, the passage also states: ""pugna sajila tiniharu pry: sheher wa campusharuma awasthit thee."" - which means they were easily accessible, typically in cities or campuses.

Therefore, the best answer is a combination of **A: Sugam sthal maa** (accessible location) and **B: Sahar ko kendramaa** (city center) and **D: College campus maa**.

Since the options don't allow for multiple answers, and ""Sugam sthal maa"" is the most general and inclusive of the other two, the most appropriate answer is:

**A: Sugam sthal maa**
"
Euta aadhunik anusandhan telescope kaha rakhine sambhavana hunchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Euta thulo sthaan maa (A large location)**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Adhikatam adhunik anusandhan telescopeharu anukul watawarniya awasthaharu bhaeka **durgam kshetraharuma vishal suwidha hun**."" (Most modern research telescopes are vast facilities in remote areas with favorable environmental conditions.)

This directly implies that they are placed in large locations, often remote. The other options are mentioned in the context of older laboratories, not modern telescopes."
Anuchhed anusar samudri kinar maa shanta sanga din bitauna kun kshetra sabai bhanda ramro chha?,"Sahi jawab ho **C: Utter Harborr jilla**

3.  Central Auckland: paragraph le paudi surakshit chhan bhanchha.

Paragraphma mention bhayeko anusar Uttar Harbor jilla ma bhayeka sabai tataharu baluwa bhayeka hunchhan ra paudi khelna surakshit chhan.

tyasaile sahi uttar B: Uttar Harbor jilla ho."
Anuchhed maa varnan garieko sthan bhraman garda kun kura lai anuchit maninchha?,"The passage explicitly states:

*   ""holocast wa najiharuko barema thatta nagarnuhos."" (Do not joke about the Holocaust or atrocities.)
*   ""Sanrachanaharuma bhitte chitra lagaera wa scratch garera sitelai kharab nagarnuhos."" (Do not deface the site by drawing graffiti or scratching on structures.)

Therefore, options C and D are explicitly mentioned as being inappropriate.

*   A (Gambhir hune abhinay garnu - Acting serious) is not inappropriate; the passage encourages respect and seriousness.
*   B (Site waripari kehi chinha raakhnu - Putting up some signs around the site) is not mentioned as inappropriate, although depending on the nature of the signs, it could be disrespectful.
*   C (Thatta garnu - Joking) is explicitly stated as inappropriate.
*   D (Samrachana maa kornu - To carve into the structure) is explicitly stated as inappropriate.

Since the prompt asks for only one answer, and both C and D are direct prohibitions, we can assume that the question is asking for the *most* inappropriate behavior. Joking about the Holocaust is likely seen as more offensive than defacing a structure. However, both are wrong.
Considering both the English translation and my understanding, I think the best answer is:

**C: Thatta garnu**
**D: Samrachana maa kornu**

Therefore C and D are both correct."
Yea madhye kunle boli chaalikaa bhasha janauchhan?,"The correct answer is **D: Prakritik**

The passage states: ""Jahansamma, dherai sanket haru kewal catalanma matra sanket garinchhan kinky yo kanundwara pahilo adhikarik bhashaka rupma sthapit cha.""  This directly supports option B, indicating that Catalan is used because it is the officially established primary language of the region.

Isko arth ho ki Taizicheng ski kshetrako karyakram beijingmaa hune chhaina.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: Taizicheng ski kshetra karyakram**
"
Anuchhed anusar kun 2022 maa beijing le aayojana garnechha?,"The correct answer is **C: Shitakaalin olympics**.

The first sentence of the paragraph states: ""Sun 2022 maa hune shitkalin olympic khelko ayojak sahar chinko beijing sahar hune cha."" This translates to ""The host city for the Winter Olympic Games in 2022 will be Beijing, China.""

While Beijing will host indoor ice events and the closing ceremony (options B and D), and while it will be the first city to host both Summer and Winter Olympics (making option A tempting), the *specific event* Beijing is hosting in 2022 is the Winter Olympics. Therefore, C is the most direct and accurate answer to the question.
"
Avian influenza ko sankraman hune sambavana sabai bhanda badhi kaslai hunchha?,"The passage states: ""Jyan gumaune mancheharumadhye dheraijaso kukhura palanma cam gurney wyaktiharu raheka chan..."" This translates to ""Most of the people who lost their lives were people working in poultry farming...""

Therefore, the answer is **C: Kukhura paalan maa kaam garne vyaktiharu** (People working in poultry farming).
"
Anuchhed anusar tala die madhye kun wakya le bird flue lai sahi rupmaa janauchha?,"Correct Answer: C: Chara ko awalokan garne haru maa sankraman ko jokhim hunchha

Explanation: The paragraph states ""chara ra standhari prani duwai sankramit hoon sakchhan...charaharu awalokan garna chahane wyaktima pani yasabata kehi jokhim raheko cha."" This directly supports option C, that those who observe birds are also at risk of infection.

Other options are incorrect because:

A: The paragraph says most fatalities are poultry workers but it doesn't say they were *first* infected.
B: The paragraph mentions that both birds and mammals can be infected, but doesn't clearly state that there are more infections in birds than in humans.
D: The paragraph mentions that *some* cases in humans are fatal, not *all* of them."
White Sea-Baltic canal le ke jodchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Arctic mahasagar ra baltic samudra**.

The passage explicitly states: ""White C-Baltic Canelle dheraijaso nadi ra talharudwara onega tall, ladoga tall ra cent pietersbergmarfat arctic mahasagarlai baltic sisanga jodchha."" This translates to ""White Sea-Baltic Canal mostly connects the Arctic Ocean to the Baltic Sea through rivers, lakes Onega, Lake Ladoga, and Saint Petersburg.""
"
Anuchhed anusar kasto kisim ko gadi maa rahadaani sankalan garnu parchaa taki yatru lai avarodh nahos?,"Correct answer is **B: Raatri sleeper rail**

The passage states: ""Rati sutne railharuma, conductorle rahadaniharu sankalan garna sakdachhan taaki tapainlai nindrama badha napugos."" (In sleeper trains at night, the conductor can collect tickets so you aren't disturbed in your sleep.)
"
Anuchhed anusar kunai sima pariko rail maa tapai ko id kun bela janch garine chha?,"The correct answer is **D: Kudiraheko rail maa**.

The passage states: ""Kehi sima pariko railharuma nirikshan chaliraheko trainma garinchha ra tapainsanga tee trainharumadhye kunai ekma chadhda many id hunu parchha."" (Some border trains have inspections done on the running train, and you must have valid ID when boarding one of those trains).  This clearly indicates the ID check happens on the moving train.
"
Yea madhye singapore ko uccha ushna pradeshiya kshetra maa rahada kun vishay uthne sambhavana huncha?,"Correct answer: **C: Dherai garmi le thakne**

The passage explicitly mentions that Singapore is located in a ""highly tropical"" region a few degrees north of the equator, and you need to be prepared for both heat and strong sun. This means being fatigued by the high heat (dherai garmi le thakne) is the most likely issue to arise from being in Singapore's tropical region.

"
yea madhye kun german pastries ko lagi seasonal tatwa maninchha?,"Correct answer is **C: Aalubakhada**.

The passage states ""garmiyamma cherry ra alubkhada pani prayog garinchha"" (cherries and plums are also used in summer). This indicates that plum (aalubakhada) is a seasonal element used in German pastries, specifically during the summer.
"
Anuchhed anusar budget maa bhraman garda kun kura ko sifaris garidaina?,"The correct answer is **C: Manisharu sanga paisa magnu** (Begging money from people).

The passage explicitly states that the advice *doesn't* include exploiting other people for one's own benefit, which would encompass begging or taking advantage of others. The other options are implied or directly related to reducing travel expenses.
"
Anuchhed anusar sano budget maa bhraman garda kaslai garo parna sakchha?,"Correct Answer: **D: Jasle talika anusar kam garna ramailo manchha**

Explanation:

The passage states: ""Kharchaharulai jhandai shunyama jharna aaram, samay ra purvanuman tyagna chahaneharule nyunatam budget yatra hernuhos."" This implies that budget travel requires sacrificing comfort, time, and predictability (planning). Therefore, someone who likes to stick to a schedule (talika anusar kam garna ramailo manchha) would find it difficult. Other options are not true.
"
Tala madhye kun vakya le point marion ra fairmont bich ko drive lai sahi ruple janaudaina?,"The correct answer is **C: Gati ko simako palana garidaina**.

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""uniharuka lagi kada agyapalan anyathabhanda ajha mahatwapurna hunchha"" which translates to ""strict adherence to them (speed limits) is even more important than usual."" This directly contradicts option C.

Let's look at why the other options are not the right answer:

*   **A: Tyaha dherai lama durgam bata haru chhan** - P states ""Point mariane ra fairmont bichko wistarle aksar durgam jungli bhubhag hundai"" translating to ""The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont often passes through difficult and wild terrain.""
*   **B: Lane haru sanghuro chhan** - P states ""sanghuro marg"" translating to ""narrow roads""
*   **D: Mobile sewa maa kunai samasya aaudaina** - P states ""yahan mobile phone sewa nikai ramro cha."" translating to ""the mobile phone service here is quite good."""
Anuchhed anusar buffalo-Pittsburg rajmarga maa chalak haru laa yea madhye kun kuramaa dhyan dinu parchha?,"Based on the paragraph provided (P), the correct answer is:

**C: Tibra mod maa chado sawari chalaunu**

**Explanation:**

The paragraph explicitly states that the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway (referred to as ""Bafelo-pitsberg rajmargma"") presents challenging driving conditions due to:

*   **""Thado shreni, sanghuro marg ra dharilo bakra""** which translates to steep gradients, narrow roads, and sharp curves.

Option C is the only one that directly reflects these described conditions. The paragraph advises caution because of these sharp curves.

Anuchhed anusar aafnai car maa sutne yojana banauda kun kura aawashyak parcha?,"The correct answer is **A: Aafno gaadi ko sima bare darho bujhaai (A strong understanding of the limits of your car)**

The passage states, ""...tapain shayed phile nai afno car chalauna parichit hunuhunchha ra yasako simitta tapainlai thaha cha"" which translates to ""...you are probably already familiar with driving your car and you know its limits."" This implies that understanding your car's limitations is important for car camping.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Seat muni sarna milne gadi (A car that can be moved under the seat)** The passage mentions cars with reclining seats but doesn't specify about moving under the seat.
*   **C: Tent** The passage explicitly says that sleeping in your car on a road trip isn't ""camping"".
*   **D: Camp banauna niji jaga (Private land to build a camp)** The passage mentions private property as a place you could draw attention in a foreign city, but not as a necessity for car camping itself."
"Anuchhed anusar, yadi radar maa rahane ho bhane car maa camper haru le kun kura bata joginu parchha?","The correct answer is **C: Sahar maa wa niji jagama tent lagaunu**.

The passage states ""Kunai akarko shaharma niji sampattima wa pall sthapana garda sajilai dhyan akarshan hoon sakha."" This translates to ""You can easily attract attention by setting up a tent in a public space or private property in another city."" Therefore, to stay under the radar, car campers should avoid setting up tents in cities or on private property.
"
Anuchhed anusar dosro patak casablanca kasle punanirman gare?,"The correct answer is **D: Morakko kaa sultan**

The passage states: ""Morakkoko sultanle shaharlai daarah ell badayako rupma punarnirman gare ra yasalai tyahan wyaparik adharharu banaune spenka wyapariharule casablancako name die.""
"

**B: Portuguese**
"
Anuchhed anusar sintra le videshiharu sanga kasari pahichan banae?,"The correct answer is **C: Lord byron kaa sakaratmak samiksha haru** (Lord Byron's positive reviews).

The paragraph states that Sintra was ""recorded by Lord Byron and made famous to foreigners after its peaks shone."" This directly implies that Lord Byron's writings (reviews) helped to popularize Sintra among foreigners.
"
Armenia le kaslai manyata didaina?,"The correct answer is **D: Naya ganatantra**.

The passage states ""...armanialgayatka kunai pani sthapit rashtrale yasalai adhikarik manyata dieko chhaina."" which translates to ""No established nation, including Armenia, has officially recognized it."" The ""it"" in this sentence refers to the ""naya ganatantra"" (new republic) formed in Nagorno-Karabakh.
"
Azerbaijan ra armenia bich ko sambandha lai kasle asar gariraheko chha?,"Correct answer is **C and D**:

*   **C: Kutnitik tarka haru (Diplomatic arguments)** - The passage states that diplomatic discussions regarding the region continuously harm the relationship between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
*   **D: Nagorno-Karabakh kshetra (Nagorno-Karabakh region)** - The conflict over this region is the root cause of the tension, and the reason for the ongoing diplomatic arguments.

Option B is not directly influencing the relationship right now, it is in the past. Option A is wrong because the passage does not explicitly mention how they are impacting the relationship."
Charlotte maa taxi lida kun karan le thap shulka parna sakchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Tin yatru hudaa (Tin yaatri hunda)**.

The passage states, ""2bhanda badhi yatru hunale adhibhar lagnale yo vikalpa awashyakbhanda badhi mahango hoon sakha,"" which translates to ""Having more than 2 passengers can result in a surcharge, making this option more expensive than necessary.""  Therefore, three passengers (tin yaatri) would incur a surcharge.
"
Anuchhed anusaar charlotte maa balbalika sanga basda huna sakne befaida ke ho?,"Anuchhed anusaar Charlotte maa balbalika sanga basda huna sakne befaida **B: Taxi ko yatra** ho.

"
Spanish ko aagaman chile ko uttari bhag maa kasko niyantran thiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Incas**.

The passage states: ""16 aun shatabdima spenishharu prasthan garnuaghi uttari chilima inca shasakharuko adhinma bhaeko bella..."" which translates to: ""Before the Spanish departure in the 16th century, northern Chile was under the control of Inca rulers...""
"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun ghatana 1810 maa ghateko hoina?,"The correct answer is **B: Chile le spanish mathi vijay prapta garyo**.

The paragraph states that Chile declared independence in 1810, the Napoleonic wars were ongoing, and Spain had temporarily abandoned central government. However, decisive victory over the Spanish was not achieved until 1818. Therefore, Chile did not win a victory over Spain in 1810.
"

Italian abhivyakti ‘cinque terre’ le ke janauchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Paanch gaau**.

The passage states that Cinque Terre includes ""paanchwata sano samudri tatawarti gaaunharu"" which translates to ""five small seaside villages"".  Therefore, 'cinque terre' means 'five villages'.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, jado maa chiplana bata jogina kasto jutta upayukta hunchha?","The correct answer is **B: Stud jadit jutta**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically mentions ""Kehi butma stadharu hunchhan ra tyahan chipline awasthaka lagi... stud garieko sahayogi upkaran hunchhan."" (Some boots have studs and there are studded auxiliary equipment for slippery conditions...). This clearly indicates that studded shoes are suitable for preventing slips in the cold.
*   **A: Saanghuro taluwa bhaeko jutta** - The passage mentions hills (heels) should be low and broad, implying narrow soles are not ideal.
*   **C: Aglo taluwa bhaeko jutta** - The passage focuses on tread depth and material, not height of the sole.
*   **D: 1/5 inch gahiro dhacha nabhaeko jutta** - The passage states the pattern should be at least 1/5 inch (5 millimeters) deep, so a boot without that depth would *not* be suitable.
"
Jado ko bela hiun bhaeko batomaa traction sudhar garna yea madhye kasle sahayog gardaina?,"Sahee uttar **D: pani** ho.

Yea madhye hawaii ra cook tapu bich ko sahi samanta ke ho?,"The question asks for the similarity between Hawaii and the Cook Islands based on the provided text.

The text states: ""Hawaiko jastai samay khetra bhae pani yea tapulai kahilekaahin """"hawai tall""""ca rupma liine gareko cha."" This translates to ""Despite having the same time zone as Hawaii, these islands are sometimes considered the 'Hawaii tall'.""

Now, let's evaluate the options in relation to the provided information:

*   A: Dubai maa thula hotel chhan - This is irrelevant.
*   B: Dubai le rajya ko manyata paeka chhainan - This is also irrelevant.
*   C: Dubai ko time zone eutai ho - This is incorrect since the passage discusses the time zone similarity between hawaii and cook islands.
*   D: Dubai maa sahar chhainan - This is irrelevant

None of the above options is the similarity between Hawaii and Cook Islands. As I have to choose the correct answer from the provided options. I will choose ""C"". Even though this is incorrect it is the most suitable among the other options.

Final Answer: (C)"
Yea madhye kunle cook tapu haruko sahi vardan gardaina?,"The correct answer is **D: Yas tapu muluk ra hawaii ko eutai time zone ho.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Cook Islands has the same time zone as Hawaii (Hawaiko jastai samay khetra bhae pani).
* The other statements are all accurate according to the text.
"
Yea madhye kun ranger station le dui prakar ko awas ko vikalpa dinchhan?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Sirena ekmatra ranger station ho jasle chhatraas basobas ra camping bahek ramro bhojan pradan gardacha."" This directly indicates that Sirena offers both ""chhatraas basobas"" (dormitory accommodation) and camping.
*   The passage says La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos provide only camping, and the question asks which one offers *two* kinds of accommodation."
Anuchhed anusar yadi credit ko satta nagad chahida kaha park ko anumati reserve garna sakinchha?,"The passage states that park permits can be secured from the Puerto Jiménez ranger station, but they do not accept credit cards. Therefore, if you need to reserve a park permit using cash instead of credit, you can do so at **Puerto Jiménez**.

So the correct answer is **B**.
"
Anuchhed anusar thado bhubhag maa kun prakar ko skiing garinchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Backcountry skiing**.

The passage states ""Schemarfat backpacking: yo gatiwidhilai backcontry sky, sky touring wa sky hiking pani bhaninchha.""  It then goes on to describe it as taking place in steep terrain.  Therefore, Backcountry skiing is the type of skiing done in steep terrain according to the passage.
"
Anuchhed anusar uccha gati maa pugna backcountry skier lai ke le sahayog garna sakchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Ramro awastha (Good conditions)**.

Here's why:

*   The paragraph states: ""Ramra awasthaharuma tapain hindnubhanda kehi adhik duree paar garna saksham hunuhunechha..."" which translates to ""In good conditions you will be able to cover a bit more distance than walking..."". This directly implies that good conditions help backcountry skiers cover more ground.
*   The paragraph clearly states that a heavy backpack hinders cross-country skiing speeds.
*   It also indicates that backcountry skiing involves rugged terrain, so well-maintained trails (D) are not typical and wouldn't contribute to high speed in that context.
*   While stiff boots (A) are important for control, they don't directly equate to higher speed in the way that good conditions do."
Puna pravesh garda asahaj mahasush garne yatri lai ke garda kathin hunchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Ghar ko sanskriti maa puna ghulmil huna**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Naya sanskritima ghulmil garna sajilo samay bhaeko yatruharulai kahilekaahin uniharuko mull sanskritima punah ghulmil garna gahro hunchha."" This translates to: ""Travelers who have an easy time assimilating into a new culture sometimes find it difficult to reintegrate into their original culture.""
"
Anuchhed anusar puna pravesh garda mahasus hune asahajta kasto yatri kaa lagi badhi kathin huna sakchha?,"The paragraph states: ""Naya sanskritima ghulmil garna sajilo samay bhaeko yatruharulai kahilekaahin uniharuko mull sanskritima punah ghulmil garna gahro hunchha."" This translates to: ""Sometimes, travelers who easily assimilate into a new culture find it difficult to re-assimilate into their original culture.""

Therefore, the answer is **B: Tyasta yatri jo videsh maa chadai samayojan hunchhan (Travelers who adjust quickly abroad).**
"

The passage states: ""...caribharu araakan bhasha bolneharu thee..."" which translates to ""...Caribs spoke the Arawakan language..."".

Skiing lai manoranjanatmak karyakram ko rupma lokpriya banaunu maa kaslai shreya janchha?,"Based on the provided text, the passage mentions that the first ski club was founded by Norwegians in Australia in 1861. However, the question asks who made skiing popular as a recreational activity. The passage doesn't directly state who made it popular, but it does mention ""sky bums"" are enthusiasts who plan trips and stay at resorts all day to ski.

Therefore, the best answer from the options provided is:

**A: Sky bums**
"
Anuchhed anusar skiing lai kahile khel ko darja dieyo?,"The correct answer is **D: 17au satabdi**.

The passage states: ""Downhill skiing khel kamtima 17aun shatabdidekhi khelidai aieko cha"" which translates to ""Downhill skiing has been played as a sport since at least the 17th century.""
"

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: Jungli wanyajantu (Jungli wildlife)**
"
Yea madhye kunle sana purvi african tapu haru lai janaudaina? ,"Correct answer is **C: Jungle wanyajantu ko lagi pratishtha**

**Explanation**

*   **France sanga ko sambandha:** The passage states that ""Dherai jasta sanah tapuharu... francesanga sambandhit chan.""
*   **Dherai vilasi resort haru:** The passage says that the islands are ""vilasibich resortka rupma parichit chan.""
*   **Aru muluk haru bata swantrata:** The passage mentions that many of the small islands are ""swatantra rashtraharu hun.""
*   **Jungle wanyajantu ko lagi pratishtha:** The passage only mentions Madagascar as being known for its wildlife, not the smaller East African islands in general."
Anuchhed anusar paramparik church haru maa easter kasari manainchha?,"Correct answer: **B: Sanibar rati nigrani**

The paragraph states: ""Dherai paramparagat charchaharule prayaha easter saptahako antyama shanibar rati easter prarthana ayojana gardachan, jasma mandaliharule khrishtako punarutthanlai manauna thyakkai madhyarati utsava gardachan."" This clearly indicates that traditional churches hold a vigil on Saturday night to celebrate Easter."
Ecuador pravesh garnu aghi kehi aawashyakta haru bata jogina euta cuban nagarik sanga suru ma ke hunu parchha?,"The correct answer is **D: America ko green card**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yuesko green carddhari quali nagarikharule yass shartama chhuta pauna equaderiako wanijya dutawas bhraman garnu parchha."" This directly implies that US Green Card holders may be exempt from certain requirements (to be fulfilled via Ecuador's consulate).
* **The question asks:** ""Ecuador pravesh garnu aghi kehi aawashyakta haru bata jogina euta cuban nagarik sanga suru ma ke hunu parchha?""

The rest of the options (A, B, and C) are general requirements for travel, as mentioned in the passage, but are not specifically related to waiving other requirements.  The passage explicitly links a US Green Card to a potential exemption.
"
Ecuador kaa bhraman aawashakta haru ke kaa lagi design garieko hudaina?,"Based on the provided text, the Ecuador travel requirements are designed to:

*   **Verify the length of stay of the traveler.** ( ""...jaane-aune/agadiko yatra tikat tapainko basaiko lambai pramanit garna awashyak hunchha."")
*   **Verify the validity of the passport.** (""Tapainko passport kamtima tapainko yatra mitibhanda 6 mahinaka lagi many hunupardacha."")
*   **Offer organized travel provisions.** (""Duwai deshaharubich sangathit praasi praaha pradan garna yea awashyaktaharu tokieko ho."")

The text doesn't directly state the requirements are designed to manage migration flow (though indirectly, immigration policies often aim to do so) or to keep the number of travelers to a minimum. So, the answer is most logically:

**A: Yatri ko sankhya nyunatam raakhne** (Keeping the number of travelers to a minimum)

The requirements mentioned in the text focus more on the individual traveler's documents and travel arrangements than on restricting overall tourist numbers.
"
Tala die madhye swadesh bhanda videsh maa kun kura mahango hunchha?,"Correct Answer: B: Uccha star ko frame

Explanation:

The passage states that high-end brand name frames might be more expensive than at home in some areas, implying they are more expensive abroad than domestically.

A: The passage mentions doing eye exams at home to present the prescription elsewhere, suggesting the eye exam itself is likely cheaper abroad.

C: Eye insurance is not discussed in the passage.

D: The passage implies non-branded frames are likely cheaper abroad due to lower labor costs.
"
Videsh maa uccha star ko frame kinnu ko sambhavit jokhim ke huna sakchha?,"Correct Answer: **C: Ti nakkali huna sakchhan**

Explanation:

* The passage directly states: ""Kehi naka off hoon sakchhan ra wastawik ayatitharu gharbhanda badhi mahango hoon sakne hunale tyasta kshetrama upalabdha uccha antako brandka name framema dui samasya hoon sakcha."" This translates to ""Some may be knock-offs and actual imports might be more expensive than at home, so there can be two problems with high-end brand name frames available in such areas."" The ""knock-offs"" part indicates that fake/counterfeit frames are a potential risk.

Let's look at why the other options are not the most directly supported by the passage:

*   **A: Aru thap aankha janch aawashyak huna sakchha:** While the passage mentions getting your eyes tested at home, it doesn't explicitly say that buying high-end frames abroad will **necessarily** require additional eye exams.
*   **B: Prescription kehi frame ko lagi m\\anya na huna sakchha:** The passage implies the difficulty in prescription compatibility as a general problem if buying overseas but not necessarily specific to high-end frame selection.
*   **D: Insurance le mulya lai na oghatna sakchha:** The passage does not mention anything about the inability to use insurance to cover the frame's cost."

Yea madhye kun karyakram mandir ko utsavsanga jodera heridaina?,"Diyeko paragraf anusar, mandirko utsavharu mandirko warshikotsaw, devtako janmadin, ra mandirsanga sambandhit pramukh karyakramharuko rupma manaincha. ""Hatti ko janma"" ko barema kunai charcha gareko chaina.

Tyasakaran, sahi uttar **A: Hatti ko janma** ho.
"
Sajaieka hatti kaha dekhna sakinchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Mandir ko utsav kaa julusmaa**.

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""Susajjit hattiharu, mandirka wadakadal tatha any utsawaharusahitko niyamit lawalskarle garda kerlaka mandirma hune melaharu awalokan garna dherai ramailo hunchha."" (Decorated elephants, temple orchestras and other events create a wonderful atmosphere to observe the Kerala temple festivals)
* **Q asks:** Where can you see decorated elephants?
* **C directly answers:** Mandir ko utsav kaa julusmaa (In the temple festival processions).

Let's examine why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: november antyadekhi meko madhyasamma** This is the timeframe when the festivals happen, but not the location of decorated elephants.
* **B: Mandir haru maa** While the festivals happen in temples, it doesn't specify *where* in the temple you'd see decorated elephants.
* **D: Kerala ko bato harumaa** The passage primarily focuses on temples, and while processions might briefly go on roads, the main activity is related to temple festivals.
"

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Chut haru**
"
Africa ko bhada ko dar vishwa bhraman ko bhada ko dar sanga tulana garda ke kura jodnu pardaina?,"The passage argues that when comparing the cost of flights to Africa versus a round-the-world trip, you should remember to add extra costs for places outside of Africa.  The passage specifically mentions extra visa costs, departure taxes, ground transportation, etc.

The question asks what *shouldn't* be added when comparing Africa's fare to a round-the-world fare.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Africa bahira kaa thau haru maa lagne bhisa ko thap mulya (The extra cost of visas for places outside of Africa):** The passage explicitly states to consider this. So, this IS something that should be added for comparison.
*   **B: Africa ko prasthan kar (Africa's departure tax):** This is a cost specifically associated with Africa, not other places. This would be part of the total ""Africa fare"" being compared, not an *extra* cost tacked on for the places outside Africa, therefore, it does not need to be added.
*   **C: African bhisa ko mulya (The price of the African visa):** This is a cost specifically associated with Africa, not other places. This would be part of the total ""Africa fare"" being compared, not an *extra* cost tacked on for the places outside Africa, therefore, it does not need to be added.
*   **D: Africa bahira ko thaau haru maa lagne jamin yatayat ko mulya (The price of ground transportation for places outside of Africa):** The passage explicitly states to consider this. So, this IS something that should be added for comparison.

Since the question asks what *shouldn't* be added, the best answer is either B or C. However, B talks about ""prasthan kar"" which is something the passage suggests you should consider. But C talks about ""African visa"", which is something that is already included in the ""Africa fare"".

Therefore, **C** is the most logical choice because while A & D should be included in the price, and B is already factored into the cost, **C** relates only to the overall ""Africa fare"" and is not something to add on to a comparison.

**Therefore, the correct answer is C: African bhisa ko mulya (The price of the African visa)**
"
Anuchhed anusar supermarket haru le ke kura ko vividh chanot dina thale kaa chan?,"The correct answer is **A: Tayari khana**.

The passage states: ""Badhdai gareka supermarketharule tayari khanaka thap vividh khand rakhiraheka chan."" This translates to ""Increasingly, supermarkets are offering a wider selection of ready-made foods.""
"
Tayari khana kinne grahak lai supermarket le dine kun suvidhaa aakarshak huna sakchha?,"The correct answer is **D: microwave oven**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that some supermarkets provide microwaves or other means to heat up ready-made meals. This is a direct benefit that could attract customers looking to eat their purchased meals immediately.
*   **A: On-site restaurants**- While the passage mentions restaurants in some stores, it's not a *universal* amenity provided *specifically* for heating up ready-made meals.
*   **B: Kam vividh chanot**: This is the opposite of attractive. Customers usually want a wider variety of choices.
*   **C: Kaacho khana**: Ready-made food and raw food are different categories.

Therefore, the option that is particularly attractive for a customer who is purchasing ready-to-eat food and is looking for a good facility at a store is microwave."
Yea madhye french bolne belgian ra swisle ke nabujhna sakchhan?,"Correct answer is **B: Anautha french sabdaharu**

**Explanation:**

The text mentions that French-speaking Belgians and Swiss learn standard French in schools, so they would understand the standard French number system. It also says there are slight differences in the number system and pronunciation. The only option that French-speaking Belgians and Swiss might *not* understand is ""anautha french sabdaharu"" (unusual French words), as the passage highlights slight differences in vocabulary as a differentiating factor.
"
Yea madhye kun kura france maa bhae jastai belgium ra switzerland maa chainana?,"The correct answer is **B: Sankhya pranali (Number system)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Belgium and Switzerland have *slight* differences in their number systems compared to France.
*   It also mentions differences in pronunciation, but specifically highlights the number system as a key difference.
*   The passage indicates that standard French (including standard French number system) is taught in schools in Belgium and Switzerland.
*   The passage doesn't say anything about differences in spelling."

Kun awastha maa GPS navigation app bhanda standalone gps upakaran prayog garnu sahaj hunchha?,"Correct Answer: **C: Jaba tapai dayarabhanda bahira hunu hunchha**

Explanation:

The passage states that GPS navigation apps on smartphones are the easiest and most convenient method when you're abroad IF you have data. However, it also points out that their performance is limited or unavailable if you don't have data or are out of range. Therefore, in the absence of data connection, a standalone GPS device would be more reliable, making option C the most appropriate.
"
Standalone upakaran bhanda gps navigation app prayog nagarne karan ke ho?,"The passage lists several advantages of using GPS navigation apps on smartphones. Let's break down each option in relation to the passage:

*   **A: Data connection bare chinta linu naparne** - This is **incorrect**. The passage explicitly states that the performance of GPS apps can be limited or unavailable outside the data range.

*   **B: Paisa ko bachat** - This is **correct**. The passage says it can save money on buying new maps or GPS devices, or renting GPS from car rental companies.

*   **C: Bhada baata joginu** - This is **correct**. The passage indicates that you save money from renting GPS from car rental companies.

*   **D: Naya naksa kinna naparne** - This is **correct**. The passage explicitly says using GPS apps can save money on buying new maps.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: Data connection bare chinta linu naparne** because the passage states that data connection *is* something you need to worry about when using GPS apps. While the other options are advantages of using GPS navigation apps on smartphones, the question asks about a reason *not* to use them instead of standalone devices. The risk of lacking a data connection is a disadvantage of using apps over standalone devices."
Anuchhed anusar tapai upayukta jahaz sanga jodinu bhayo bhanne ko guarantee ke ho?,"Correct answer is **C: Galapagosko bhraman maa viseshagyata rakhne travel agent sanga booking garnu**

The passage explicitly states:

*   ""Afule june agentka madhyambata book garnuhunchha ukta agent vibhinna prakarka jahajharubare ramro gyan bhaeka galapagos visheshagya hun bhane kurako sunishchit garnuhos."" (Make sure the agent you book through is a Galapagos specialist with good knowledge of different types of ships.)
*   ""Yasale nishchit gardacha key tapainka vishesh ruchiharu ra wa simitataharu uniharuka lagi sabaibhanda upayukta jahajka sath mileka chan."" (This ensures that your specific interests and limitations are matched with the most suitable ship for them.)

Therefore, using a travel agent specializing in Galapagos trips is the passage's recommended way to ensure you are matched with a suitable ship."

Anuchhed anusar euta chalakh juwadele ke kura bata joginu parchha?,"Correct answer is A: Dherai madira piune

**Explanation:**

The paragraph states that while some casinos offer free alcoholic drinks, ""matawalapanle nyayalai badha purryaunchha ra sabai ramra juwadeharule shanta rahanuko mahatwa jandachhan"" which translates to ""drunkenness hinders judgment and all good gamblers know the importance of staying calm."" Therefore, a smart gambler should avoid excessive drinking.
"
Anuchhed anusar wakya ko bichma boliko kun bhag lai capitalized garinchha,"The correct answer is **B: Nam**.

The passage clearly states that nouns (namharu) are always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
"
Anuchhed anusar nam lai capitalize garna le kun kura kathin banchha?,"The passage P states that capitalizing all nouns makes it easier to read, but *more difficult* to determine whether certain verbs or adjectives have been used in writing.

The question asks what capitalizing all nouns makes difficult.

*   **A: Padhai (Reading):** The passage says it makes reading *easier*.
*   **B: Kriya bich ko farak (Difference between verbs):** The passage discusses nouns, not verbs directly.
*   **C: Lekhai (Writing):** This is the correct answer. The passage explicitly states that it's harder to identify verbs/adjectives in writing.
*   **D: Vastu bich ko farak (Difference between objects):** This is not addressed in the passage.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Lekhai**.
"
Malaysia ko durgam sthan haruma kasto ishara le bhetna aau bhanne bujhinchha?,"The passage states: ""Yadyapi malesiama, kamtima gramin ilakama maleharuma, yasako earth """"bhetna au"""" bhane hunchha, shariratarfa chore aunlaa jhukaieko jastai..."". This means that in rural parts of Malaysia, pointing a curved index finger towards oneself means ""come here"".  While hand waving has other meanings, it is the curled index finger that translates to ""come here"".

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Chori aunlaa dobryaunu** (Pointing a curved index finger)
"
Anuchhed anusar kun isara le farki aau bhanne bujhincha?,"The correct answer is **A: Hatkela bhitra farkayera haat hallaunu**.

The passage states: ""spenka belayati yatrile haat hallaune wyaktitarfa hatkela farkaera (bidai garieko wyaktitarfa farkaunuko satta) bidai bhaniekolai farkera aune ishara sochna sakchhan."" This translates to ""Spanish British tourists can think that waving the palm towards the person waving (instead of towards the person being waved goodbye) is a gesture to come back."" So waving with the palm facing inwards is interpreted as ""come back"".
"
Anuchhed anusar himdarar ke le banaauchha?,"The passage states that ""yasale chiraharu, himdararharu paida garnechha, june hiun pulharudwara rokin sakdachha."" This translates to ""This will create cracks, ice crevasses, which can be stopped by snow bridges.""

Therefore, ice crevasses (himdararharu) are related to snow bridges. The passage describes how cracks and crevasses are formed but does not explicitly state their primary composition. Given this association, it is logical to infer that snow bridges play a role in their existence, as they influence the formation or continuation of these cracks/crevasses. Thus, the correct answer is not explicitly mentioned in the text as an explanation to what himdarar is made of.

However, let us proceed with choosing the closest option from those available. The sentence structure suggests the process:
1. unstabe glaciers move down from mountains
2. this creates cracks, ice crevasses
3. snow bridges can stop them.

Option A: Hiun pul (snow bridges) are what can STOP the crevasses.
Option B: Asthir himnadi (unstable glaciers) are the SOURCE of the cracks and crevasses.
Option C: Bhatkeko himagufa (collapsing ice cave) is mentioned in the passage as collapsing but doesn't necessarily create the crevasses.
Option D: Khukulo dhikka (loose blocks) are mentioned at the end of the passage, but they originate from the edge of the glacier.

Given this information, the best answer is:

**B: Asthir himnadi (unstable glaciers)**

It's the movement of the unstable glacier that causes the formation of cracks and crevasses.
"
Anuchhed anusar hiun pul le yea madhye ke lai chopchha?,"The passage states: ""yasale chiraharu, himdararharu paida garnechha, june hiun pulharudwara rokin sakdachha."" This translates to: ""It will create fissures and crevasses, which can be blocked by snow bridges.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: chiraharu** (fissures)
"
Anuchhed anusar kun sthan ko bhraman garnu aghi yatru haru le thap sawadhani apnaunu parchha?,"Correct Answer: B: Goma waripari ko kshetra haru

Explanation:
The passage states: ""Goma yathochit surakshit bhae tapani goma bahirka kunai pani bhramanharuma uttari kibhu prantama raheko sangharshako awastha bujhna anusandhan garnu parchha.""

This translates to: ""Although Goma is reasonably safe, for any excursions outside Goma, one must research to understand the conflict situation in the North Kivu province.""

Therefore, travelers should take extra precautions when visiting areas around Goma."

Canyon ko suraksha garna kun niti lyaieko chha?,"Correct Answer: D: Simit sankhyaka anumati haru

Explanation: The passage states that permits are limited ""to protect the canyon."" Thus, limiting the number of permits is a policy to protect the canyon.

Anuchhed anusar greenland ghumna jane yatru le kun kura bata joginu parchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Greenland kaa aadivasi lai “eskimo” bhanera bolaunu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that while the term ""Eskimo"" might be acceptable in the US, it's considered offensive by many Arctic people outside the US, especially in Canada. Therefore, tourists visiting Greenland should avoid using this term.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aparadh ko uccha dar bhaeka kehi kshetra haru** The passage states that crime is practically unknown in Greenland and that there are no ""bad areas"" in cities.
*   **B: Varsha bhari mausam tato hune bhaekaa le bhari luga** The passage clearly states that the cold weather is the main danger, especially if unprepared, implying the need for warm clothing, not the opposite.
*   **C: Kamjor internet connection kaa karan le online kam garne apeksha rakhnu** The passage states that internet is widely available and well-established in Greenland."
Anuchhed anusar bina tayari greenland bhraman garne yatri kaa lagi kun kura kathin huna sakchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Mausam (Weather)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Chiso mausam shayed tayari nagareka manisharule samana gareko ek matri wastawik khatra hoon sakha."" (Cold weather is perhaps the only real danger faced by unprepared people.)"
Yea madhye kun ahile kendriya plaza kaa rupma prayog hunchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

The passage explicitly states that Jardín de la Unión ""Kendriya plazako rupma un yasale karya garchha"" which translates to ""It serves as a central plaza"".
"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun jardin de la unioun maa paidaina?,"The correct answer is **D: Purano convent bhawan**. Here's why:

*   The paragraph states the *temple* of San Diego is the only surviving building of the 17th-century convent. It implies the other buildings are gone.
*   The other options are explicitly mentioned as existing around the Jardín de la Unión: concerts from the gazebo, restaurants around the garden, and the Callejón del Beso (kissing alley) with the house from the old love story."
Anuchhed anusar din ko paidal yatra bare kun wakya sahi hoina?,"The correct answer is **D: Sanah bacha bhaeka pariwar kaa lagi bahira hune din ko paidal yatra upayukta hudaina.**

The paragraph states that families with young children *may* require extra preparation, but it also explicitly states that day trips outdoors with children and preschoolers are easily possible. Option D claims that it is *not* suitable for families with small children, which contradicts the paragraph.
"
Anuchhed anusar kun bela din ko paidal yatra ko lagi nyunatam tayari aawashyak huncha?,"The correct answer is **B: Jaba bato sajilo chha** (When the path is easy).

The passage explicitly states ""Sajilo batoma ek dine paidal yatraka lagi kehi tayariharu awashyak hunchhan"" (For a one-day hike on an easy path, minimal preparations are needed). The other options suggest more preparations are needed.
"
Baki norway bhanda rogaland wa agder ma raheka uccha samasthali haru ma ke bhinnata chha?,"The passage says:

*   High plateaus in Norway are called ""vide"" which means wide, open, treeless spaces with limitless extension.
*   In Rogaland and Agder, they are often called ""hei"" which means barren moor covered with heather.

The question asks for the difference between high plateaus in Rogaland/Agder and the rest of Norway. The passage indicates that in Rogaland and Agder they are frequently called ""hei"" implying they are barren moor covered with heather. Thus the answer is that they are often covered in heather.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Ti praya heather le bhariekaa hunchhan**
"
"Anuchhed anusar, yea madhye kun norway ko lagi swabhavik hoina?","Answer: B: Jungle bhaeko uccha samasthali

Explanation:
The passage states the following:
* **Fyords** and **Valleys** are part of the landscape that give way to plateaus.
* These plateaus (called ""Vide"") are **wide, open, treeless spaces.**
* Areas like Rogaland and Agder have ""Hei,"" which are **barren moorlands.**

Therefore, the passage describes Norway as having fjords, open treeless plateaus, and moorlands.  It *explicitly* states that the plateaus are treeless.  A forested plateau would therefore be UNcharacteristic.
"
Skiing maa ruchi bhaeka paryatak le kahile parwat station ko bhraman garnu parchha?,"Correct answer: **A: Jado maa**

**Explanation:**

* **P statement** explicitly mentions that many hill stations offer activities like skiing and snowboarding during the winter season (hiundai).
* **Q question** asks when tourists interested in skiing should visit hill stations.

Therefore, the logical answer is winter (jado maa).
"
Anuchhed anusar parwat station haruma kahile dherai paryatak hunchhan?,"The correct answer is **C: Indian garmi maa** (Indian summer).

The passage states, ""Parwat stationharuka lagi paryatakiya mausam bharatiya garmiko awadhima sadharantaya wriddhi hunchha."" This directly translates to ""For hill stations, the tourist season generally increases during the period of Indian summer.""
"
Yadi tapai sahayog ko lagi dunga khojdai hununchha bhane ke nagarna upayukta hunchha?,"The passage emphasizes actively engaging with others to find a boat. Let's analyze the options in that context:

*   **A: Dock tala mathi garnu** (Wandering up and down the dock): This aligns perfectly with the passage's suggestion to approach people cleaning boats, talking to Burmese sailors, and generally trying to connect with as many people as possible on the dock.
*   **B: Captain sanga mitrata gasnu** (Befriend the captain): While potentially helpful in the long run, the passage focuses on broader networking to be recognized as someone looking for a ride. Just befriending one captain isn't as effective as making your needs known widely.
*   **C: Aafno sewa ko prachar garnu** (Promote your services): The passage doesn't explicitly suggest offering services. It focuses on making connections so people know you're looking for a boat.
*   **D: Dunga kaa aru yatru haru lai vevasta garnu** (Manage other boat passengers): This has nothing to do with finding a ride. The passage is about *you* finding a boat, not managing other passengers.

**Therefore, the best answer is A: Dock tala mathi garnu.**"
Sahayog ko lagi dunga ko khoji garda marinas ko waripari ke garnu prarchha?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Sailor sanga samparka garnu** (Contact sailors).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states:

*   ""tapain aru dunga chadhneharulai bhetnuhunecha ra tiniharule uniharusanga tapainko jankari adanpradan garnechan."" (You will meet other boaters and they will exchange information with them.)
*   ""barma nawikharusanga sampark gurney prayas gardai hunu hune cha."" (You will be trying to contact Burmese sailors.)
*   ""Sakesamma dherai wyaktiharusanga kura gurney prayas garnuhos."" (Try to talk to as many people as possible.)
*   ""afna sanah dunga safa gariraheka manisharusanga nazikin khojdai"" (Trying to get close to people who are cleaning their small boats)

These statements all directly support the idea of contacting sailors to find a boat that needs help.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Radar muni basnu** (Stay under the radar): There is no information in the text that suggests to stay under the radar.
*   **C: Uniharula yachat safa gariraheko bela matra najik janu** (Only approach them when they are cleaning the yacht): The text indicates to approach sailors while they are cleaning the boats, so this is a good time to contact sailors, but the text does not mean that you should only approach them during this.
*   **D: Aru hitchhiker bata tadhai rahanu** (Stay away from other hitchhikers): The text doesn't mention avoiding other hitchhikers. The focus is on contacting as many people (specifically sailors) as possible.
"
Tapu ko aupaniveshik itihas ko bare maa ruchi rakhne paryatak ko lagi kun sthan upayukta hunchha?,"The passage states: ""Belayatle yo sthan afno upaniweshka rupma lie ra tapain kshetrako aupaniweshik wigatka pramanharu khojdai hunuhunchha bhane suru garnaka lagi yo ramro sthan ho."" and ""Hangkang tapuko adhikansh sahari wikasko punah kabza garieko bhumiko uttari bank ghana rupma bharieko cha"".

Therefore, the best place for tourists interested in the island's colonial history is the **A: Uttari kinara** (Northern Bank).
"
Manmohak drishya lai prathamikta maa rakhne paryatak ko lagi kun sthan upayukta hunchha?,"The passage says: ""Hangkangka sarwashreshtha drishyaharu prapta garnaka lagi, tapu chhodnuhos ra kovuluna waterfrontko viparit januhos."" This translates to: ""To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go opposite to the Kowloon waterfront.""

Therefore, the answer is **D: Kowloon waterfront**.
"
Rikab maa sawari garne ko khutta aljhine jokhim kam garna kehi gadi maa ke hunchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Surkasha patti**

The passage states that some saddles, especially English ones, have safety bars that release the stirrup (rikab) from the saddle if a rider is falling and pulls back. This is designed to reduce the risk of the rider's foot getting caught.
"
Sawari jutta ko kun viseshata le rikab prayog garda sawari garne ko suraksha badhauchha?,"Correct answer: A: Khasro ra sanghuro paitala

The passage mentions that riders used to wear boots with heels and soft, narrow soles, which implies this feature increases safety when using stirrups (rikab).
"
Aatithya aadanpradaan sanjal maa yatri lai ke prastav garinchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Sthaniya host sanga awas**.

The passage clearly states that hospitality exchange networks connect travelers with locals in the cities they are visiting. This implies that the network offers accommodation with local hosts. The other options are either not mentioned or are only related as the reason for the creation of such a network.
"
Anuchhed anusar aathitya aadanpradaan sanjal sambandhi kun kura sahi hoina?,"The correct answer is **A: Yatri haru lai jahile sthaniya host ko lagi sandharva pradan garinchha**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that available hosts are listed ""kahilekaaheen any yatriharudwara sandarbha ra samikshako sath diinchha"" (sometimes given with referrals and reviews from other travelers). This means that referrals for the host are not always provided to travelers.
*   The other options are correct, according to the paragraph."
Anuchhed anusar sajha hostel kothama kasto prakaar ko pahuna bhetne sambhavana kam huncha?,"The correct answer is **C: Sanah ketaketi sanga yatra garne pahuna** (Children traveling with young children).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states, ""Bachchaharu bhaeka pariwarharu durlabh drishya hun"" which translates to ""Families with children are a rare sight."" This directly implies that you're less likely to find families with children in hostels.

The other options are either more likely or explicitly mentioned:

*   **A: Wishau varsha ko pahuna (Visitors in their twenties):** The passage says hostels mainly cater to young people.
*   **B: Eklai yatra garne pahuna (Travelers who are traveling alone):** The passage states, ""Hostels mainly cater to young individuals,"" which would include those traveling solo.
*   **D: 30-35 varsha ko pahuna (Visitors aged 30-35 years):** This age group could fall into the ""young individual"" category, although the passage also mentions elderly visitors."
Anuchhed anusar hostel maa basne sambawana kasko badhi hunchha?,"Pariichhed anusar, hostelharule yuwa wyaktiharulai khan-panko prabandha gardachhan. Tyahan bridha yatriharulai pani bhettauna sakincha. Bachchaharu bhaeka pariwarharu durlabh drishya hun.

Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun wakya le boomerang throwing lai sahi rupma janauchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Kehi boomerang matrai farkina sakchhan**.

Here's why:

*   **P** states: ""Australiama upalabdha adhikansh bumarengharu wastawma firta nahune khalka hunchhan."" This directly translates to ""Most boomerangs available in Australia are actually not the returning type."" Meaning, only *some* boomerangs return.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yadi sahi tarika le fyakne ho bhane yo farkera aafnai haat maa aauchha** (If thrown correctly, it will return to your hand) - While true for *some* boomerangs, the passage explicitly states that *most* boomerangs sold in Australia don't return, regardless of throwing technique. Therefore, this is not a universally correct statement about boomerang throwing.
*   **B: Yo paryatak bhanda sthaaniya bich badhi lokpriya chha** (It is more popular among locals than tourists) - The passage states boomerang throwing is a popular activity that tourists like to do, but does not say anything regarding how popular it is with locals
*   **C: Austrailia maa dherai boomerang upalabhdha chainan** (There are not many boomerangs available in Australia) - The passage says most boomerangs are available in Australia, but that most don't actually return"
Javanese khana maa visesh gari ke ko prayog garinchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Nariwal ko chiny**.

The passage explicitly states ""jabhanese khanama samanya rupma masalaharu prayog garieka parikarharu pardachan... badam, khursani, **chiny (vishesh gari jabhanese nariwal chiny)**"".
"
Anuchhed anusar sankraman rog kasari failinchha?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: Rogjanak**.

Here's why:

*   **P: Chikitsa shabdajalsanga aparichitharuka lagi, sankramak ra saruwa shabdaharuko alag-alag earth chan. Sankramak rog bhairas, bacteria, fungus jasta rogjanak wa any parajiwiharule garda hune rog ho.** (For those unfamiliar with medical terminology, contagious and infectious have different meanings. Infectious diseases are caused by pathogens like viruses, bacteria, fungi, or other parasites.)

*   The passage explicitly states that infectious diseases are caused by *roganak* (pathogens).

Therefore, the paragraph says infectious diseases spread through *roganak*. The other options are related but not the direct cause of spread as stated in the paragraph."
Anuchhed anusar kun le garda sankraamak rog nahune maanincha?,"Based on the paragraph:

*   **Virus**, **Bacteria**, and **Fungus** are explicitly mentioned as causes of infectious diseases.
*   **Khop** is mentioned as a *prevention* measure for diseases, not a cause.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Khop**."
Kasto awastha maa prayogkarta lai vyaktigat vpn pradayak bhanda web proksi ko chanot garda paryapta hunchha?,"Correct answer is: **C: Prayogkarta http traffic reroute garna chahanchhan**

Explanation:

The statement (P) explicitly mentions that VPNs are superior to web proxies because they redirect all internet traffic, not just HTTP. Therefore, if a user only needs to redirect HTTP traffic, a web proxy would be sufficient. The other options (A, B, and D) are situations where VPNs are advantageous due to their broader capabilities, security, and performance.
"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun vakya vpn ra web proksi kaa bare sahi hoinan?,"Sahi jawab D ho. Anuchhedle VPN le HTTP traffic matra nabhaera sabai antarik traffic reroute garna sakchha bhanechha, yasko arth ho ki D galt ho."
Aafno tatkal ko kshetra bhanda bahira ko phone company ko prayog ko anumati kasle dinchha?,"The answer is **A: Internet routed calls**.

The passage states: ""Kalharu internetmarfat rout garine bhaekale tapainle afu basne ra yatra gurney thaaunko phone companyko sewa prayog garirakhnu pardaina."" (Since calls are routed through the internet, you don't have to keep using the phone company service of the place you live and travel.) This clearly indicates that internet routed calls allow you to use phone services outside your immediate area.
"
Anuchhed anusar kehi call prapta garna ke garnu parcha?,"The correct answer is **A: Global number kinnu parchha**.

The passage states: ""Prayaha tapainle global number chhuttai kinnu parchha jasle PSTN phoenharulai tapainlai phone garna anumati dinchha."" (Often you have to buy a separate global number that allows PSTN phones to call you.)

The other options are incorrect based on the passage:

*   **B:** The passage explicitly states you don't need to use your local phone company.
*   **C:** The passage states you don't need to get a number from your local community.
*   **D:** The passage talks about PSTN phones calling *you*, not you buying one."
Yea madhye kun le italian sabda ko uccharan lai sahi ruple janaudaina?,"Sahi uttar ho: **D: Praaya sabda ko uccharan tyas pachi aaune swor dhwoni anusar bhina huna sakchha**

Izmir ko kun viseshata aadhunik samay bhanda aghi utpatti bhaeko ho?,"Sahi jabaf D: Rato tile bhaeko chhath ho.

Paragraph le bhancha ki ""thulla bolebhardharu, shishale dhakeka bhawanharu ra adhunik kinmail kendraharu paramparik rato-tile bhaeka chhatharule bharieka chan, 18 aun shatabdiko bazar ra purana masjid ra girjagharharu..."" yasko arth ho ki rato tile bhaeko chhath aadhunik samay bhanda agadi dekhi nai ra aadhunik bhawanharu bhanda purano ho."
Yea madhye kun kurale izmir lai sahi rup maa janaudaina?,"Sahi jawab ho **B: watawaran le paramparik turkey lai pratibimbit garchha**.

Paath anusar, Izmirko watawaran ""paramparik tarkikobhanda bhumadhya yuropko jasto cha"" bhanera ullekh gariyeko chha, jasale isko watawaran paramparik turkeyko watawaran hoina bhanne suchit garchha."
Hanami sabdale ke ko awalokan janauchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Cherry kaa full**.

The passage states that Hanami is ""cherry fuliraheko herne"" which translates to ""cherry blossom viewing"". Therefore, Hanami sabdale cherry kaa full ko awalokan janauchha.
"
Cherry kaa full awalokan garne pahilo party haru ko aayojana kasle garyo?,"Correct answer is **C: Japan ko raaja**.

Explanation: The passage says ""Afno ra shahi adalatka any kuleen sadasyaharuka lagi matra japanma pahilo cherry blasm party ayojana garieko thiyo.""  This translates to ""The first cherry blossom parties in Japan were organized for themselves and other elite members of the royal court."" Thus, the king of Japan.
"
Anuchhed anusar jerusalem ko kun paksha le paryatan lai sabai bhanda kam aakarshit garchha?,"The answer is **B: Yo israel ko rajdhani bhaeka le**.

The passage highlights Jerusalem's religious significance, cultural features, and historical sites as attractions for tourism. While it mentions that many countries don't recognize Jerusalem as the capital, the fact of being the capital itself isn't presented as a *reason* for tourist attraction. The other options are explicitly stated as factors contributing to tourism.
"
Yea madhye kun kura anuchhed maa jerusalem ko viseshata ho bhanera ullekh garieko chhaina?,"The correct answer is **B: Rajnitik prabhav (Political influence)**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Rochak itihas (Interesting history)**: The paragraph explicitly mentions ""hajarau warsha failieko manmohak itihas"" (a fascinating history spanning thousands of years).
*   **C: Dharmik mahatwa (Religious significance)**: The paragraph states that Jerusalem is sacred to three monotheistic religions and serves as a spiritual and religious center.
*   **D: Sanskritik sthal (Cultural site)**: The paragraph mentions it serving as a cultural center and the presence of historical, archaeological, and cultural sites.

The paragraph *does* mention that most countries and the UN don't recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, but it doesn't focus on *Jerusalem's* political influence as a characteristic. The political aspect is about other countries' stances on it, not the city's inherent power or influence. Thus B is the correct answer."
Anuchhed anusar kasta yatri lai wild card ko kharid le faida puryaudaina?,"The correct answer is **B: Kruger rashtriya nikunj matra ghumne yatri lai**.

Here's why:

*   The paragraph says that a Wild Card is advantageous ""to those who wish to gain entry into a selection of parks in South Africa and all of its national parks.""

*   Therefore, if someone is *only* visiting Kruger National Park, a Wild Card (which covers multiple parks) would *not* be beneficial. They would only need to pay the individual entry and conservation fees for Kruger.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dherai bhanda dherai SANParks ghumna chahane yatri lai** - This is incorrect because the text implies that the card is beneficial to anyone planning on visiting more than one of the South African national parks.
*   **C: Park kaa shulka bare chintit yatri** - This is incorrect because the text does not specify that those concerned about park fees would specifically benefit from using the card.
*   **D: Kruger rashtriya nikunj ra arko park ghumne yojana banaeko yatri** - This is incorrect because they would need to pay individually for the Kruger Park. A wild card would be beneficial for visiting multiple locations."
Yea madhye kun vakyale kruger rashtriya nikunj lai sahi rup maa janaudaina?,"The correct answer is **C: Yo dakshin africa ko sabai bhanda sano rashtriya nikunj ho** (It is the smallest national park in South Africa).

The passage clearly states Kruger National Park is a major attraction and managed by SANParks, suggesting it is a significant park, not the smallest. Options A, B, and D are all directly supported by information in the passage.
"
Yea madhye kun kura le himal ko thado bhag chadhne parvatarohi kaa lagi khatara nimtyauna sakchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Bhijeko awastha** (Wet conditions).

The passage explicitly states: ""...vishesh gari jab bhijeko hunchha, yo chhittai khatarnak huna sakcha"" (especially when it is wet, it can quickly become dangerous).
"
Yea madhye kun wakya le machu pichu himal ko aarohan lai sahi rup ma pratibimbit gardaina?,"The passage states: ""Bhiralo bhagharuma steel kebalharule sahayak railing pradan garchhan."" (Steel cables provide auxiliary railing in steep sections.)

Option B states: ""Thado bhag haru maa kunai haindrail chainan"" (There are no handrails in steep sections).

This contradicts the passage. Therefore, option B is the statement that does *not* accurately reflect the climb to Machu Picchu.

The answer is **B**.
"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun majorcan khana ko pramukh hissa hoina?,"Paurak anusar, Majorcali khana roti, tarkari ra masuma adharit cha. Gedagudiko barema kahile ullekh gariyeko chaina. Teskaran sahi jawab ho:

A, C ra D sahi chan kinaki uniharu anuchhedko jankari sanga milchan.
"
Yea madhye kun tarika hangi ko khaldo laai tataune swabhavik tarika hoina?,"The correct answer is **A: Gas**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that the Hangi pit is heated by hot stones or geothermal heat.
*   The question asks which is NOT a natural way to heat the Hangi pit.
*   Gas is not mentioned in the passage.
*   Hot stones and geothermal heat are mentioned in the passage."
Yea madhye kun kurale garda bhikshu ra bhikshuni bata visesh manyata paina sakinchha?,"The passage states: ""tar tapainle afain chadar lear aunubhayo ra ajha tyo ujyalo rangko cha bhane tapainle praeshdwarma bhikshu wa yogibata muskan paunuhunecha.""

This translates to: ""but if you bring your own shawl and it's a bright color, you'll get a smile from the monks or yogis at the entrance.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Chamkilo khada ko pahiran** (Bright shawl).
"
Yea madhye kun kapada gumba maa upalabdha hune sambhavana kam hunchha? ,"Correct answer is **A: Skirt**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""dheraijaso gumbale vinatayari aune mahilaharuka lagi chadar upalabdha garaunchhan"". This means headscarves are generally available for women.
* **The passage also mentions:** ""purushharule ghunda dhakine gari trouserharu lagaunu awashyak hunchha. Yo pani praeshdwarma stockbatt udharo lynn sakinchha"". This means trousers are available for men.
* **While the passage mentions that women need to wear skirts that cover the knee**, it does not mention providing skirts for women.

Since shorts are not mentioned in the passage, it can be assumed that they are not available at the door. 
"
Antartic kshetra ko bhraman maa paryatak lai tara herne awasar kahile prapta huncha?,"The correct answer is **C: Jado ko mahina maa**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Tapain jadoma arctic wa untarctic kshetraharu bhraman garnu hunchha bhane tapainle dhruwiya ratko anubhav garnu hunechha jasko matlab surya kshitij bhanda mathi udaundaina."" - Which means you experience polar night (sun doesn't rise) if you travel in winter.

*   **The passage also implies:** that the polar night, caused by winter, provides a good opportunity to see the aurora and stars because it's dark.

Let's break down why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Garmi mahina maa (Summer months):** The passage directly links the experience to polar night, which happens in winter. In summer, the opposite happens (midnight sun).
*   **B: Manis kam bhaeko samaya maa (When there are few people):** While fewer people may reduce light pollution, the primary factor for seeing the stars is the darkness of the polar night.
*   **D: Jaba prakash ko pradusan kam hunchha (When light pollution is low):** Low light pollution is a contributing factor, but the polar night (winter) is the necessary condition."
Kun bela satelite phone mobile ko satta maa prayog garnu wyavaharik hudaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Jaba sight line ko sateline sanga ko jadan maa badha hunchha**

The passage states: ""Upagraha phone samanyataya mobile foneka lagi pratisthapan hundaina, kinbhane tapain phone sampark garnaka lagi upagrahako spashta linema bahira baseko hunuparchha."" This translates to ""Satellite phones are generally not a replacement for mobile phones, because you must be outside in a clear line of sight to the satellite to make phone calls.""

Therefore, when the line of sight to the satellite is obstructed, a satellite phone is not a practical replacement for a mobile phone.
"
Satelite phone kun awastha maa mobile bhanda upayukta hunchha?,"Sahi uttar **B: Dunga ko yatra maa** ho.

**Explanation:**

Paragraph P le spashta sanga bhaneko chha ki upagraha phone durgam sthanharuma jahan mobile phoneko coverage hudaina, tyahan matra upalabdh hunchha. Dunga ko yatra maa, khaas garera samudri yatra maa, mobile networkko coverage huneko sambhavana kam hunchha. Yasto awasthama upagraha phone upayukta hunchha.

Any options kina galat hun:

*   **C: Jaba durgam data ko awashyakta hudaina:** Paragraphle bhaneko chha ki durgam data ko awashyakta bhayeko abhiyanharuma upagraha phone prayog garchha.
*   **D: Jaba mobile ko coverage hune sambhavana badhi huncha:** Mobile coverage bhayeko awasthama mobile phone nai upayukta hunchha. Upagraha phoneko jaruri hundaina."
Yea madhye kasto dwanda le transnistria republic ko sirjana bhayo?,"The correct answer is **B: Jatiyata**.

The passage states ""Moldobha ek bahu-jatiya ganatantra rashtra ho tathapi yo **jatiya dwandwabata** grasit cha. 1994 maa, yo dwandwale purvi moldobhako swap-udghoshit transnistria ganatantrama purryayo..."" This clearly indicates that ethnic (jatiya) conflict led to the creation of the Transnistria republic.
"
Yea madhye kun kura transnistria ganatantra ko moldova bhanda farak chha?  ,"Parihedma diyeka jankari anusar, transnistria ganatantra moldova bhanda UN ko manyata ra mudrama farak chha.

*   Montevideo dakshin golardhama chha, jahan uttari golardhama jado hunda grishmam hunda chha.
*   Tyahan kunai vishesh """"warsha"""" ra """"sukhkha"""" rituharu chhainan.

Yasaka matlab, hawahuri ko awastha se bachna ke liye best time uttari golardh ko garmi ko mahina mein hunda chha, kyoonki us waqt montevideo mein garmi ko season hoga."

Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun kura le vidhwansa bhanda euta sthaapit graffitti kalakar laai janauchha?,"The paragraph states that established graffiti artists exist and their paintings look more like artwork than illegal tags. Therefore, the answer is:

**A: Graffitti kala** (Graffiti Art)

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Korkar** (Boomerang): This is mentioned in the paragraph, but it's unrelated to graffiti artists.
*   **C: Sarvajanik sthan maa anawashyak bhitte chitra** (Unnecessary graffiti in public places): This describes vandalism, which is the opposite of what an established artist does.
*   **D: Nametine chinha** (Indelible marks): This could describe both vandalism and art, but it doesn't specifically point to an established artist."
Sangit maghotsaw ko kun paksha sahbhagi haruka lagi anubhav ko abhinna hissa ho?,"The correct answer is **B: Sthal maa camping garnu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""kehi utsabharuka lagi, sangeet utsabharuma upasthit dheraile cytema shivir rakhne nirnaya garchhan ra adhikansh upasthitharu yasalai anubhawko ek mahatwapurna hissa manchan."" This translates to: ""For some festivals, many attendees at music festivals decide to camp and most attendees consider this an important part of the experience."" This directly supports that **camping on-site is an integral part of the experience** for many attendees.

The other options are not the main focus of the passage in relation to being an ""integral part of the experience"":

*   **A: Aafna ketaketi lyaaunu** (Bringing your children): While the passage mentions special camping areas for families with young children, it doesn't state that bringing children is an integral part of the overall festival experience for everyone.
*   **C: Aber rat samma sangit maa ramaaunu** (Enjoying music until late at night): The passage mentions music continuing into the evening, but it is noted as something to consider and not necessarily an integral part of the experience for all attendees.
*   **D: Bihan chadai uthnu** (Waking up early): This isn't mentioned in the passage."
Anucched anusar mahotsav maa upasthit hune le sangit ko chheu maa camping garne bhae ke kura lai prathamikta dinu parchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Bihan chadai uthnu**.

Here's why:

*   The paragraph states: ""Tapain karyako najik hoon chahanuhunchha bhane sangitko najik euta camping khetra prapta garna **chhittai pugnu** parchha."" This directly translates to ""If you want to be close to the event, you must **arrive early** to secure a camping spot near the music."" Arriving early implies waking up early to get there.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Rati jane:** While the paragraph mentions music continuing into the night, it doesn't emphasize going specifically at night for camping. The key is arriving early to secure a spot.
*   **B: Pariwar bhaeko kshetra maa basne:** This is only relevant if you have small children. The primary advice is for everyone wanting to camp close to the music.
*   **C: Off-site maa camping garne:** The passage suggests that to be in the vicinity of the music, one ought to camp closer."
Anuchhed anusar aagantuk harule new mexico maa ratri jiwan khojda kun thau bata tadha rahanu parchha?,"The correct answer is **B: sana bar haru** (small bars).

The passage explicitly warns that small town bars in New Mexico are not always good places for out-of-state visitors and that drunk driving concentration is higher in smaller towns around bars.
"

"
Budget bare sachet yatru harule kasto kisimko peya padartha bata tadhai rahanu parchha?,"The passage states that ""falaka rus mahango bhae pani utkrishta cha"" (fruit juice is expensive but excellent). Thus, budget-conscious travelers should avoid fruit juice.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: Fall ko juice**
"
Anuchhed maa varnan garieko kshetra anusar tala die madhye kun peya padartha order garda server jhukkina sakchhan?,"The correct answer is **D: Sada seto**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Australialiharuka lagi """"sada seto"""" kafiko vichar videshi ho."" This means that ordering ""sada seto"" (flat white) coffee in the described region would be unusual and likely to cause confusion. The other options are either local beverages or readily available wines.
"
Tin satabdi sanga raheko upaniwesh ko awadhi kun samuha le suru gareko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Spaniards**.

The passage states: ""Spainyharule aupaniweshikaran suru gare june teen shatabdisamma rahyo."" This translates to ""The Spaniards started the colonization which lasted for three centuries.""
"
Anuchhed anusar euta parisian lai najik lyaaune sabai bhandha ramro tarika ke ho?,"The correct answer is **C: Binamra bannu**.

The passage states that being arrogant, uncivilized, and proud is usually just a wrong traditional impression. The best way to go to Paris like a ""well-bred"" person is to have good manners. If you perform some basic courtesies, Parisians will suddenly melt.  ""Binamra bannu"" translates to ""being polite/humble,"" which aligns with the passage's advice of having good manners and performing basic courtesies.
"

Options haru yaha kin galat chhan:

*   **A: Rail ko dabba agadi patti hunchha** - Yo sahi chaina. Metroplus kochharu ""cape taunako najikaiko railko antyama"" hunchhan.
*   **C: Tesro shreni ko ticket bhanda sasto** - Yo viparit ho. Metroplus thorai mahango cha.
*   **D: Metro ticket to mulya jatikai** - Yo sahi chaina. Metroplus thorai mahango cha, ""yadyapi yuropko samanya metro ticket bhanda sasto hunchha."""
Anunchhed anusar cape town ko pratyek yatru rail maa ke hunchha?,"Correct Answer: D: Pahilo ra tesro dubai shreni kaa dabba

Explanation:

The paragraph states: ""Harek railma metroplus ra metro duwai kochharu hunchhan"" which translates to ""Each train has both Metroplus and Metro coaches.""

*   Metroplus is considered ""first class""
*   Metro is considered ""third class""

Therefore, each train has both first and third class carriages."

The passage states: ""Bhuktani phone wa sadharan telefonharubata prayog garna sakine prepaid store phone cardharuko bhramak kramale **harek kunako store** bharieko hunchha."" (Prepaid store phone cards, which can be used with payment phones or regular telephones, fill **every corner store** in a wide range.)

Therefore, the passage directly indicates that prepaid phone cards are readily available in corner stores.
"
Kehi card haru le dine ramro call rate kasari upbhog garna sakinchha?,"The passage says that these services are accessed through a toll-free number from a phone.

So the correct answer is **B: Toll-free number dwara**.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, yea madhye kun rukh Plitbhais tall raashtriya nikunja maa tyati paaidaina?","The passage states that Plitvice Lakes National Park is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation. While the passage does not explicitly list which trees are *not* found there, we can infer based on the types of vegetation present.

*   Beech (Katus): These are commonly found in temperate and Mediterranean forests.
*   Spruce (Devdar): These are found in alpine forests.

The passage says it's a *mixture* of both alpine and Mediterranean, implying trees from both these environments are present. Katus could be considered to be present in some Mediterranean forests, but not to the same extent as Beech trees. Therefore, Beech is the least likely to be found extensively within the park.

Therefore, the answer is **A: Beech**."
Yi madhye kun durlabh jivjantu Plitbhais tall rashtriya nikunj maa bhetinchhan?,"The correct answer is **D: capercelli**.

The passage explicitly mentions that capercelli is one of the rare animals found in Plitvice Lakes National Park.

Aafno grihabhumi aauda kun prakriya anaupacharik hunchha?,"Correct Answer: A: Adhyagaman janch
"
Grihabhumi aaunu aghi kun kura thaha paunu jaruri hunchha?,"The best answer is **B: Yadi tapaile kaanuni sima ko lagi aafno saman ko ghosana garnu parchha bhanne bare**

Here's why:

* **The original text (P) focuses on:**
    * **Avoiding issues at customs and inspection:**  The core message is about being aware of customs regulations and declaring items appropriately.
    * **Knowing what you can and cannot bring:** This is directly tied to customs rules.
    * **Declaring items within the legal framework:**  This emphasizes the importance of complying with declaration requirements.

* **Option B aligns perfectly:** It highlights the *need to know whether you need to declare your goods within the legal limit*. This is the central practical action encouraged by the original text.

Let's see why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Yadi adhyagaman janch kendra chha bhanera (If there is an arrival inspection center):**  While relevant, the key concern is *not* just whether there is an inspection center, but rather what you need to *do* if there is one. The text emphasizes *preparing* for customs, not just its existence.
* **C: Yadi tyahaa bhansar niyantran chha bare (If there is customs control):** Similar to A, the problem is not that customs exists.  It is that passengers need to be aware of the rules of what they can or cannot bring, and declare their goods.
* **D: Yadi tapaile lyaeko kunai saman ko anumati chhaina bare (If any of the items you brought are not allowed):**  While important to know, *declaration requirements* are even more fundamental.  Even if you are bringing something allowed, you might still need to declare it.  Therefore, awareness of declaration requirements is important to be aware of.

Therefore, the question asks about *preparing* for customs by checking what items may need to be declared if they go over the legal limits.
"
Anuchhed anusar kun kura prachur matra maa huda parwatarohi le lagatar cochamo upatyaka bhitra naya marga patta lagauchhan?,"Correct Answer is **D: Bhitta**

**Explanation:**

The paragraph states: ""...yasaka anant sambhawit **parkhalharuka bichma** nirantar naya margharu sthapana gardaichhan."" The phrase ""anant sambhawit parkhalharu"" translates to ""endless potential walls."" This clearly indicates that the abundance of **walls** (bhitta) provides the climbers with continuous opportunities to establish new routes within the Cochamo Valley."

Yasaile, Star Alliance ley SkyTeam bhanda dherai warpaar lagaauchha.

So the correct answer is:

**B: Star Alliance**
"
Kun vimaan gathabandhan le dakshini golarda maa sabai bhanda kam mahasagar ko waripaari lagauchha?,"The correct answer is **D: SkyTeam**.

The passage explicitly states: ""(ra SkyTeam ley kunai euta pani paar gurney sametdaina)"". This means SkyTeam crosses the fewest (zero) oceans in the southern hemisphere among the airline alliances mentioned.
"
Kun tour sanstha Global Running Tours ko uttaradhikari ho?,"The correct answer is **B: Go Running Tours**.

The passage states: ""Global running tourseko uttaradhikari, go running toursele..."" which translates to ""The successor of Global Running Tours, Go Running Tours...""
"
Anuchhed anusar go running tour le kati wata drishya awalokan sanstha laai jodchha?,"Correct answer is **C: Darjanau**

The paragraph explicitly states: ""Global running tourseko uttaradhikari, go running toursele char mahadwipma **darjanaun** citerning pradayakharulai sanjalma joddachha.""

This directly translates to ""Go Running Tours, the successor of Global Running Tours, connects **dozens** of sightseeing providers in a network across four continents.""
"
Chituwa ko spasta awalokan garna chahane paryatak le ke garnu parchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Durbin ko prayog garnu parchha**

The passage states: ""Sinha, cheeta ra chituwa kahilekanhi lajaunchhan ra tapain durbinbata herera tinlai ajha ramrari dekhnu hune cha."" This directly translates to ""Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them even better by looking through binoculars.""

Therefore, binoculars are the recommended tool for better observation of leopards.
"
Anuchhed anusar aagantuk le gadi maa sawari garda kasto kisim ko janawar bhetna sakchhan?,"Correct Answer: B: Jiraf

Explanation:
The paragraph states: ""Kehi janawarharu, jastai hattiharu ra jirafharu, car ra stariya upkaranka najik jaan ruchaunchhan ramro drishya herne mauka dinechha."" (Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, like to go near cars and sturdy vehicles, giving a good opportunity to see them well.)
This clearly indicates that giraffes are the animals that visitors are likely to encounter while riding in a car.
"
Anuchhed anusar ke garna le bhraman ko kharchha ghatchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Char jana ko samuha bhetda**.

The passage states that travel is cheaper in larger groups. If you are alone or with only one friend, it suggests forming a group of four to six people to get a better per-person price.

Anuchhed anusar san francisco ko vishwa prasidhi mathi kasko yogdan chha?,"The correct answer is **A: Kala ra media kaa vibhinna vidhaama niyamit upasthiti (Regular presence in various forms of art and media).**

The paragraph states: ""Sangeet, chalchitra, sahitya ra lokpriya sanskritima barambar chitrit garine hunale yo sahar ra yahan raheka pramukh sthalharu vishwabhar chinin maddat mileko cha."" This translates to ""Because it is frequently depicted in music, film, literature, and popular culture, this has helped the city and its major attractions become known throughout the world."" This directly supports the idea that its presence in various art forms and media contributes to its global fame.

While the other options are true based on the paragraph, they are not the *primary* reason for its global fame. The paragraph specifically emphasizes the impact of art and media representation.
"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye san francisco bare kun vakya sahi hoina?,"The correct answer is **D: Arthatantra purai paryatan maa nirbhar chha** (The economy is entirely dependent on tourism).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that San Francisco's economy is diverse (""Yasako arthawyawastha vividh bhae pani...""), even though it is also linked to being a global tourist attraction. This directly contradicts option D.

*   The other options are supported by the passage:
    *   A: The passage says music, movies, literature, and popular culture frequently depict the city (""Sangeet, chalchitra, sahitya ra lokpriya sanskritima barambar chitrit garine hunale..."").
    *   B: The passage mentions San Francisco as an excellent place for various Asian cuisines (""Any asealy kujin: koreali, thai, bharatiya ra japanika lagi saan francisco utkrishta thaunharumadhye ek ho."").
    *   C: The passage says San Francisco has developed a large tourism infrastructure with numerous hotels, restaurants, and convention facilities (""Saan franciscole asankhya bhojanalaya, restaurant ra shirsha sammelan suwidha sath ek vishal paryatan purwadhar vikas gareko cha."")."
Anuchhed anusar travel agent ko sewa kasto kisim ko yatru laai faidajanak hunechha?,"The correct answer is **D: Package deal maa booking garna man paraune yatru**.

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation, and combinations of flights and hotels. This directly benefits travelers who prefer package deals, making option D the most logical answer.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Nirnaya garna nasakekaa yatru:** While travel agents can help indecisive travelers, the passage doesn't explicitly say this is their primary benefit. It focuses more on the convenience of packages.
*   **B: Aakasmikta man paraune yatru:** The passage implies a structured and pre-planned trip, which doesn't align with travelers who enjoy spontaneity.
*   **C: Bhisa surakshit nabhaeko yatru:** While the passage mentions that travel agents can give you time to gather necessary documents like visas, it's not the primary service they offer or the main benefit highlighted."
Yea madhye kun kura travel agent ko faida kaa rup maa anuchhed maa ullekh garieko chhaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Druta rup maa tayar garieka yatra kaa kagajat haru**.

Here's why:

* **B: Hotel deal:** The passage explicitly mentions that travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels (""travel agentharule samanyataya nishchit hotelharusanga samjhauta gareka hunchhan"").
* **C: Sabai kura samawesh bhaeko package:**  The passage states that travel agents often offer all-inclusive packages that include breakfast, transportation, and flight/hotel combinations (""Travel agentharule sadharantaya breakfast, vimansthal maa/baat yatayatko wyawastha samawesh bhaeko package wa flight ra hotel packageharuko sanyojan prastawa gardachan"").
* **D: Reservation garnu:** The passage states that travel agents can hold reservations for you while you gather necessary documents (""Tapainlai ukta afarka barema sochna wa afno gantawyaka lagi awashyak parne any kagjat (jastai bhisa) bhela parna samay chahiema uniharule tapainka lagi reservation garirakhna pani sakchhan"").

The passage does not mention travel agents quickly preparing travel documents.

The passage states: ""...google anuwad ho, jasle iccha gareko bhashako deta download garepachhi offline anuwad gurney anumati dinchha."" This directly translates to ""Google Translate is one of the most famous apps in this category, which allows offline translation after downloading the data of the desired language.""

Tasine hiun himpahiro hunuh ko karan ho, tara trigger hoina. Trigger ghatanaharule hiunlai tall jharna madat gardachha. Anya teen ota vikalpaharu (manis, gham ko kiran, ra thap himpat) sabai hiunlai tall jharna madat garchan.
"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye himpahiro ko rupmaa ke jharchha?,"Correct answer is **C: Thado bhiralo maa dherai hiun ko matra**
Explanation:
The passage states, ""...bhirala jaminle dherai come hiun matra thegna sakchhan ra hiun atyadhik matrama bhaeko khandama himm pahiro banera khascha.""
This directly translates to ""Steep ground can only hold a small amount of snow, and when there is excessive snow, it falls as an avalanche."" Therefore, excessive snow on a steep slope falls as an avalanche.
Here's why the other options are incorrect:
A: ""Trigger nagarieko tasine hiun"" (Untriggered cohesive snow): The passage says snow needs a trigger to fall as an avalanche.
B: ""Hiun nabhaeko thado bhiralo"" (A steep slope without snow): An avalanche requires snow.
D: ""Manis le nachalaeko hiun"" (Snow not moved by humans): The passage says humans are a frequent trigger, but it doesn't mean only human-triggered snow becomes avalanches."
Anuchhed anusar tarkari kun samagri maa adharit hunchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Jadibuti ra masala**.

The passage states: ""Masu wa sagasabjiharu pani hune jadibuti ra masalama adharit khana tarkari ho."" This translates to: ""Vegetables, with or without meat, are a food curry based on herbs and spices.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly says that curry is based on herbs and spices.
"
Kehi kshetra harumaa nariwal ko dudh kehi tarkari maa ke ko satta maa prayog garinchha?,"The answer is **C: Dahi**

The passage states: ""nariwalko dudhko prayog samanyataya dakshini bharat ra upa kehi any tatawarti kshetraharuma garinchha."" and ""Uttari bharat ra pakistanko antardeshiya kshetraharuma samanyataya dahiko prayog tarkarima garinchha"". This implies that coconut milk is used in place of yogurt (dahi) in some regions."
Pathar pugna kina Transantarctic himal ko warapara ko ghumauro aawashyak chha?,"Correct answer is **C: Visesh tractor charito hudainan**.

**Explanation:**

The passage states: ""Yiniharu dherai chharito chhainan tyasaile goreto batobata chattanko agla himalharuko waripari chuchuro pugna lamo samay lagdacha."" (They are not very fast so it takes a long time to reach the peak around the high icebergs from the groomed path.)

This directly implies that because the special tractors are not fast, they have to take a winding route around the Transantarctic Mountains. The other options are not directly supported by the given passage.

This is because the passage explicitly states that ""key dakshin africa sthira bhaepani sabai chhimeki deshharu sthira chhainan"" meaning not all neighbors are stable. The other options are mentioned in the passage.
"
Anuchhed anusar gadi maa dakshini africa ghumne paryatak kaa lagi kun sallaha kharab ho?,"The correct answer is **B: 4x4 ko sifaris garie pani praya sthan haru samanya gadi bata puginchha**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:**  ""...4x4lai atyadhik salah diinchha ra dherai sthanharu uccha wheel bases 4x4 hunda matri pahunchayogya hunchhan."" (4x4 is highly recommended and many places are only accessible with high wheel base 4x4s)
* **Option B contradicts this:** Option B suggests that most places are accessible with a normal car, even though 4x4 is recommended.  This is the *opposite* of what the passage implies.
* **Options A, C, and D are all consistent with the passage:**
    * **A:** The passage mentions unique laws for each country regarding emergency items in the car.
    * **C:** The passage says overlanding is a good way to see the beauty and get off the beaten path.
    * **D:** The passage cautions about the instability of neighboring countries.

Therefore, option B is the advice that is *bad* or not consistent with the passage's advice for overlanding in Southern Africa.

Lagu ausadh ko dhuwani bare anuchhed maa ke kura ullekh bhaeko chhaina?,"Correct Answer: D

Explanation:

The passage explicitly mentions options A, B, and C:

*   **A:** ""...kehi deshharuma pahilo patak aparadhka lagi pani atyantai kathora sajayaharu chan; yasama 1100 warshabhanda badhi jail wa mrityuko sajaya hoon sakchha."" (Some countries have extremely harsh punishments even for first-time offenses, including more than 1100 years of jail or the death penalty).
*   **B:** ""Aruka lagi bokda - kahilyai pani tapainko jholalai afno drishtibata bahira jaan nadinuhos, visheshgari jab tapain antarrashtriya simaharu paar gardai hunuhunchha."" (Never let your bag out of your sight, especially when crossing international borders).
*   **C:** ""...kinky aushadhi-sunghne kukurharulai suchana bina kunai pani samayama prayog garna sakinthyo."" (Drug-sniffing dogs could be used at any time without notice.)

Option D is not explicitly mentioned in the passage. While the passage warns about unattended bags attracting attention due to bomb threats, it doesn't state that authorities will confiscate your bag even if you aren't carrying drugs."

Tasartha sahee jawab (C) Bear ho.

This translates to ""If you live in a city with a diverse drinking culture, go to neighborhood bars or pubs that you don't frequent.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Tapaile praya najane pub (Pubs you don't usually go to)**.
"
Dhukur ko murti kaha chhan?,"The correct answer is **B: Church ko chihan maa**.

The passage states: ""Girjagharko chheuchhauma raheka kehi chihanharuma marblebata baneka dhukurharuko rochak pratimaharu chan."" (Near the church, in some of the tombs, there are interesting statues of pigeons made of marble.) This directly answers the question of where the pigeon statues are.
"
Kun kisim ko bhisama paryapta aarthik sahayog dekhanaunu aawashyak parna sakchha?,"Correct answer is **D: vidyarthi bhisa**.

The passage explicitly states that for many countries, a student visa requires proof of sufficient funds to support yourself for at least the first year of your course.
"
wistrit bhisa kaslai sabai bhadna badhi awashyak huncha?,"Correct answer is **C: Antarrashtriya vidyarthi**

The passage explicitly states that international students generally need a longer stay than casual tourists and that long-term stays in a foreign country generally require obtaining a visa in advance.
"
Machhad dekhi kahile saavadhaan hunu parchha?,"The passage explicitly states the need to consider mosquitoes when hiking through a rainforest: ""Garmima, vishesh gari, tapainle warsha wanko madhyambata paidal yatra gurney nirnaya garnubhayo bhane tapainle lamkhutteko vichar garnu awashyak cha."" This translates to: ""Especially in summer, if you decide to hike through a rainforest, you need to consider mosquitoes.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **C: Varshaban maa (Rainforest)**

The passage links mosquito awareness to rainforests more directly than the other options. While mosquitoes can be a concern in summer (A), during hikes (B), and even inside cars (D), the primary context in the passage is rainforests."

"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye sundarbans ko bare kun vakya sahi hoina?,"The correct answer is **B: Yasko aadha bhaag daldal le bharieko chha.**

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** Sundarbanle 3,850 warga kilometer kshetrafal ogateko cha, jasmadhye karib ek tihai bhag pani ra daldal kshetraharule dhakieko cha. (Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, of which about one-third is covered by water and marshlands). One-third is not one-half.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

*   **A: Yas maa baaki raheka kehi thula jungle parchhan:** The passage states: yiniharuma kunai samayama gangako maidan sametne ati thulo jangalko kehi antim baaki sthanharu samawesh chan.
*   **C: Yo sansar ko sabai bhanda thulo mangrove belt ho:** The passage states: Sunderban wishwako sabaibhanda thulo samudri kinarako mangrove belt ho.
*   **D: Yaha paate bagh bhanda dherai chittal chhan:** The passage states: yass kshetrama ahile 400 vata shahi bengal bagh ra lagbhag 30,000 harinharu raheko anuman gariyeko cha.

Therefore, option B is the only statement that is NOT accurate according to the information provided in the passage."
Jungle ko kun bhaag bharatiya simaa bhitra parchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Sundarbans raashtriya nikunja**

The passage states, ""bharatiya khetra bhitrako jangalko bhaglai sunderban rashtriya park bhaninchha."" which translates to ""The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sunderban National Park.""
"
Anuchhed anusar ko sanga angrezi bhasa ko sabai bhanda kam gyaan huna sakchha?,"Correct Answer: B: Kam umerkaa manis

Explanation:

The passage states: ""Dherai sampurna deshharu angrejima purna ruple sahaj chan ra ajha badhima tapain vishesh gari yuva manisharu majh simit gyanko apeksha garna saknuhunchha.""

This translates to: ""Many entire countries are fully comfortable in English, and at most you can expect limited knowledge, especially among young people.""

Therefore, the passage implies that younger people are likely to have the least knowledge of English compared to older individuals or speakers of other languages."
Anuchhed anusar ke uccharan garna kathin hunchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Thegaana**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Likhit shabdaharu prayaha bolieka shabdaharubhanda pani bujhna sajila hunchhan. yo visheshgari **theganaharuma sahi hunchha, june prayaha bujhine gari uchcharan garna gahro hunchhan**."" This directly translates to ""Written words are often easier to understand than spoken words. This is especially true of **addresses, which are often difficult to pronounce intelligibly**.""
"
Anuchhed anusar antar jilla station baata bus line yaatru laai kun avastha aadarsha hunchha?,"The passage states that buses heading towards Jakar/Bumthang generally leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM. It also mentions that it's advisable to book tickets in advance as the inter-district buses departing from Basharu are usually full.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A:** *Yaatru jakar tarfa jaadaichha ra usle agadi nai ticket kinisakeko chha* (The passenger is going towards Jakar and has already bought a ticket) - This aligns with the passage's information about Jakar/Bumthang-bound buses and the advice to buy tickets in advance. This is the most ideal situation as it guarantees a seat on the bus.

*   **B:** *Yaatru bumthang tarfa jaadaichha ra 7 baje bhitra pugi saknu parnechha* (The passenger is going towards Bumthang and needs to arrive by 7 o'clock) - The passage says buses *depart* between 6:30 and 7:30, not arrive. So, arriving *by* 7:00 would be difficult.

*   **C:** *Yaatru paro tarfa jaadaichha ra 11 baje pachhi niklisaknu parnechha* (The passenger is going towards Paro and needs to leave after 11 o'clock) - The passage says that going to Paro can be done easily using share taxis that are fast and comfortable. The 11 o'clock departure is irrelevant to what is ideal for bus travel.

*   **D:** *Yaatru uttar tarfa jaadaichha ra station maa 6:20 samma aaisaknu parnechha* (The passenger is going north and needs to arrive at the station by 6:20) - The passage doesn't mention anything about buses going north, so this option is incorrect.

Therefore, the most ideal situation for a passenger at the inter-district station, according to the passage, is option A.

**Final Answer: A**"
Antar jilla station baata purva tarfa yaatra garne paryatak kaa laagi kun sujhaav thik hunchha?,"Based on the provided text (P), the correct suggestion for tourists traveling east from the inter-district station is:

*   **B: Agrim ticket kinne (Purchase tickets in advance)**

The passage explicitly states: ""Antara-zilla prasthan gurney basharu pry: bhari hune bhaekale kehi dinaghi nai tikat katna salah diinchha."" (Because inter-district departure buses are usually full, it is advised to buy tickets a few days in advance).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bus haru 8:30 pachhi maatra chutchhan (Buses only depart after 8:30)** - The text states that buses going towards Jakar/Bumthang (east) usually depart between 6:30 and 7:30.
*   **C: Din bhar dherai gaadi hinchhan (Many vehicles depart throughout the day)** - While buses depart throughout the day, the passage highlights buses running east towards Jakar/Bumthang that has a limited departure window in the morning.
*   **D: Saajha garieka taaxi yaatra garne sabai bhanda upayukta maadhyam hun (Shared taxis are the most suitable means of travel)** - The text mentions shared taxis as a quick and comfortable option for *nearby* places like Paro and Punakha, not generally for eastward travel.
"
Yea madhye kun kura le timbuktu lai sahi rupma janaudaina?,"The correct answer is **C: Yaha plane maa pugna sakidaina (You cannot reach it by plane)**.

The passage states, ""Aja, timbuktu ek garib banaieko sahar ho, yadyapi yasako pratishthale yasalai paryatak akarshan banaunchha ra *yosanga ek airport cha*."" (Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction *and it has an airport*.)

The other options are supported by the text:

*   **A: Yas maa muluk ko baaki thaau bhanda arabic prabhaav badhi chha (It has more Arabic influence than the rest of the country)** is stated directly in the passage: ""Sheher deshka any shaharharubhanda bilkulai viparit ho kinbhane yasama africibhanda arbi maulikta badhi cha.""
*   **B: Yo garibi le pidit chha (It is afflicted by poverty)** is stated directly in the passage: ""Aja, timbuktu ek garib banaieko sahar ho...""
*   **D: Yo jigyaasi paryatak haruko laagi aakarshan ko kendra ho (It is a center of attraction for curious tourists)** is also supported by the passage: ""yadyapi yasako pratishthale yasalai paryatak akarshan banaunchha..."""
Ti madhye timbuktu ko baare kun tathya sahi ho?,"The correct answer is **A: Yo sahar plane maa pugna sakinchha (This city can be reached by plane)**.

The passage states that Timbuktu ""sanga ek airport cha"" (has an airport). This directly implies that you can reach the city by plane.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Yo garib bhanda badhi aakarshak chha (It is more attractive than poor)**: The passage says ""timbuktu ek garib banaieko sahar ho"" (Timbuktu is an impoverished city), directly contradicting this option. While it has a reputation that attracts tourists, that doesn't negate its poverty.
*   **C: Yaha chimeki sahar haru bhanda kam african shaili chha (It has less African style than neighboring cities)**: The passage states ""Sheher deshka any shaharharubhanda bilkulai viparit ho kinbhane yasama africibhanda arbi maulikta badhi cha"" (The city is completely different from other cities in the country because it has more Arab originality than African). This confirms this option is correct.
*   **D: Yo sahar le paryatak laai aakarshit gardaina (This city does not attract tourists)**: The passage states ""yasako pratishthale yasalai paryatak akarshan banaunchha"" (its reputation makes it a tourist attraction), directly contradicting this option."

Anuchhed anusar kun bindu maa funnel chakrawat banchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Aandhi bataas baata tala jharda**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tiniharu aandhibehariko badalbata solie jastai garera suru hunchhan ra tiniharu bhuima chhunda """"tornado"""" hunchhan."" (They start like a funnel from storm clouds and become a ""tornado"" when they touch the ground.) This implies the funnel cloud forms *before* touching the ground and *as* it descends from a storm cloud.
"
Yea madhye kun chakrawat ko sahi viseshata ho?,"Correct answer: **C: Yo jamin choye pachhi funnel banchha**

Explanation:

*   The passage states that cyclones start as clouds in thunderstorms and become ""tornados"" when they touch the ground. A tornado is the funnel-shaped cloud that we associate with cyclones when they make contact with the earth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yasle jahile 100-200 mile prati ghanta ko raftaar maa baatas ko sirjana garchha**: The passage states cyclones *often* create high winds in that range, not always.
*   **B: Yo praya bhari wastu sanga chalchha**: The passage says that tornados *can* lift heavy objects.
*   **D: Yo hawa bahira thelne ghumne stambha ho**: The passage says that cyclones *pull* air inward and upward."
Anuchhed anusar yaatru le aafno gantavya sahar ko raajnitik awastha baare kaha baata sujhaav linu parchha?,"Correct Answer: **D: Aafnai sarkar**

**Explanation:**

The paragraph states that travel advisories are under the authority of your own country's government (""Tapainle bhraman gurney desh yatra sallahakarko adhinma raheko hunchha bhane...""). While you can consult other governments' advice, it's designed for their citizens, not necessarily you (""Tapain afno bahek aru sarkarharuko salah lynn pani saknuhunchha tar tiniharuko salah tiniharuka nagarikharuka lagi design garieko ho."").
"
Bharaman sallaha ko awasthama videshi paryatak le ke anubhav garne sambavana hudaina?,"The correct answer is **D: Muluk ko rajnitik awastha bare wristrit jankari**.

The passage explicitly states that travel advisories provide a *brief summary* of a country's political situation and that the presented views are *incomplete, generalized, and overly simplified* compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.  Therefore, foreign tourists are *unlikely* to experience *detailed information* about a country's political situation through travel advisories alone.  The other options are mentioned as potential consequences or characteristics of travel advisories.
"
Anuchhed anusar kun kisim ko yatra maa booking ko lagi travel agent ko sahayata kaam parchha?,"Correct answer is **B: Ek nischit budget maa dui hapte lamo bhraman**.

**Explanation:**

The passage states:

*   ""dherai agentharu khas prakarka yatra, **budget dayara** wa gantawyaharuma visheshagyata rakhchhan."" (Many agents specialize in specific types of travel, **budget ranges**, or destinations.)

This directly supports the idea that travel agents can be helpful for planning trips within a specific budget. Other options aren't directly supported by the provided text."
Anuchhed anusar kun awastha maa yatru le travel agent bata sabai bhanda badhi faida lina sakchha?,"Sahee uttar B ho:

Anuchhed anusar yatru lai naya sthan bhraman garda hune nirasha bata jogina kun kura le madhat garna sakchha?,"Correct Answer: Aafu aayo sthaan jastai saman standard ko apekshya narakhnu

Reasoning:

The paragraph explicitly states that when traveling, things won't be the same as at home. It advises travelers to expect differences in customs, laws, food, and language to avoid disappointment or resentment towards local ways.

Option A, ""Aafu aayo sthaan jastai saman standard ko apekshya narakhnu"" (Do not expect the same standards as your place of origin), aligns directly with this advice. It suggests that managing expectations by understanding that things will be different is key to avoiding disappointment.

The other options are incorrect because:

B: Aparichit khana chaakhne icchha (Desire to taste unfamiliar food) - While openness to new experiences is generally good, the paragraph focuses on managing expectations about differences, not specifically encouraging trying new foods.
C: Aafu aayeko staan maa hune kanun ko palana garnu (Following the laws of your place of origin) - The paragraph explicitly mentions that laws will be different in the new place, implying you should learn and follow the local laws, not adhere to your own.
D: Aawaas bare agadi anusandhaan nagarnu (Not researching accommodation in advance) - Lack of research can lead to further unexpected differences, so this would not help avoid disappointment."

"
Vikasashil desh maa pahilo patak bhraman garne yatru ko laagi yea madhye kun sujhav ko sifaris garidaena?,"The correct answer is **B: Pahilo kehi din maa khana maa dherai kharcha nagarnu.**

The passage *specifically* suggests that you **should** spend money on Western-style and quality hotels, food, and services in your initial days.  Therefore, the opposite – *not* spending much on food – is *not* a recommended suggestion. The other options are directly supported by the passage.
"
Vikasashil desh maa parichit hudai garda yea madhye kun kura maa badhi kharcha garna ullekh garieko chhaina?,"Prashnale vikasonmukh desh maa parichit hudai garda kun kura maa badhi kharcha garna ullekh garieko chhaina bhani sodhchha.

Tesaile, sahi uttar **C: Camping garda gadha waa pad** ho.
"
Internet maa pahuch nabhaeko virtual pratilip chahane policy holder kaa lagi kun vikalpa utkrista hunchha?,"The question asks which option is best for a policy holder who needs a virtual copy without internet access. Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Yatra ko sathi lai ek pratilipi dinu (Give a copy to a travel companion)** - This is a good option, as the companion will have a physical copy that can be used.

*   **B: Aafulai ek pratilip email garnu (Email a copy to yourself)** - Email requires internet access to retrieve the copy, so this is not a good option.

*   **C: Laptop ko memory maa ek pratilipi bhandar garnu (Store a copy in the laptop's memory)** - This is an excellent option because the copy will be available on the laptop without internet access.

*   **D: “cloud” maa ek pratilipi bhandar garnu (Store a copy in the ""cloud"")** - The cloud requires internet access to retrieve the copy, so this is not a good option.

Therefore, the best option for a virtual copy without internet access is storing it on the laptop's memory.

**Final Answer: C**"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun kura policy maa dekhauna pardaina?,"Correct answer: D: Policy holder ko email thegana

Explanation:

The passage says the following should be shown on the policy for advice/authorization and claiming:

*   The insurer's email address
*   The insurer's international phone number

The passage does *not* mention that the policy holder's email address needs to be on the policy."
Anuchhed anusar kun negative koo aakar le saamanyataya prayog hune film dhaachaa lai pratibimbit garchha?,"The correct answer is **D: 36 x 24 mm negative**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""35 mimmy film (36 gauna 24 mimmy negative) mapdanda sabaibhanda dherai samanya cha."" This directly indicates that the 36 x 24 mm negative size is the most common."
Yea madhye kun film dancha le dSLR ko jastai resolution dinchha?,"The passage states: ""35 mimmy film ... halko DSLR ko tulanama jhandai ustai resolution dinchha.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: 35 mm film**.

Kasto mausaam maa samanyataya aandra ko samasya dekhaa parchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Tato mausam**.

The passage states: ""Chiso mausam shwasprashwasasambandhi samasya bhaejhain, garmi mausam andraka samasyaharu samanya hunchhan"". This directly translates to ""Just as cold weather causes respiratory problems, hot weather causes intestinal problems.""
"
Anuchhed anusar lagatar ko prasharan ke ko pratirodhaatmak kshamata badhchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Sthaniya kitaanu**.

The passage states: ""Gharma, sthaniya ki nirantar prasharanko karanle, tapainko pratirodhak shaktile pahilenai tiniharulai jiteka hunchhan.""  This translates to ""At home, due to constant exposure to local microbes, your immune system has already overcome them.""  Therefore, constant exposure builds resistance to **local microbes (Sthaniya kitaanu)**.
"
Schengen kshetra bhitra bhraman garnu ko faaida ke ho?,"The passage clearly states that with a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for separate visas for each Schengen member country, saving time, money, and paperwork. It also implies that you can avoid multiple passport control checks.

Therefore, the best answers from the options are:

*   **A: Dherai bhisa aavedan bata joginu (Avoiding multiple visa applications)** - This is a direct benefit mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: Paisa ko bachat (Saving money)** - The passage explicitly states this as a benefit.
*   **C: Dherai rahadani niyantran janch kendra bata joginu (Avoiding multiple passport control checkpoints)** - While not explicitly stated, the passage implies this.

**D: Rahadani ko aawashyakta naparnu (Not needing a passport)** is incorrect. You still need a passport to travel, but you don't need a separate visa for each country within the Schengen area.

So the best answer is one that includes A, B and C. If I have to pick just one, A is the most direct and explicitly mentioned benefit. However, the passage clearly implies that A, B and C are all benefits. If it's possible to select multiple answers, then A, B, and C are the correct answers.

Annuchhed anusar mulya bare sachet yatru kaa lagi vancouver ko kun gantavya kam aakarshak hunchha? ,"The passage mentions Whistler as being expensive (""Whisler (bhyankuwarbata 1.5 ghantako drive) mahango raheko cha""). Therefore, for price-conscious travelers, Whistler would be the least appealing.

The answer is **D: Whistler**
"
Anuchhed anusar kun gantavya le yatru lai vancouver ko asali anubhav dinchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Bowen tapu**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Bowen Island offers a ""pramanik samudaya bhyankubharko thik chheu"" (authentic community just outside Vancouver). This implies a more genuine Vancouver experience than other locations. Whistler, while offering excellent outdoor activities, is characterized as expensive and while well-known due to the Olympics, it's also quite a drive from Vancouver. Downtown Vancouver is mentioned as a starting point for transportation to Bowen Island. Granville Island isn't mentioned. Therefore, Bowen Island is the best answer according to the passage.
"

Anuchhed anusar november ra march ko bichaa victoria falls jharana ko faida ke ho?,"Correct answer is C: Jharana ko natakiya drishya (The dramatic view of the falls)

The passage explicitly states, ""Warsha ritu (novemberdekhi march samma) maa, paniko matra dherai badhi hunechha ra jharana jhana badhi natakiya hunechha."" This translates to ""During the rainy season (November to March), the water level will be very high and the falls will be even more dramatic."""
Anuchhed anusar video khichna ko lagi drone ko prayog garda ke sifaris garidaina?,"The correct answer is **D: Bhid bhaeko sthaan maa matra video khichnu jaha drone lai chal paudaina**.

The passage states that flying a drone near an airport or in a crowd is *almost always a bad idea*, even if it's not illegal. Therefore, it is not recommended to fly a drone in a crowded place.

The other options are recommended actions:

*   **A: Kun kura ko video khichne anumati chha bhanera suruma janch garnu** (Check what you are allowed to film) - The passage explicitly advises to check what you are allowed to film and if you need any additional permits.
*   **B: Thap license linu** (Obtain further license) - The passage explicitly advises to check what you are allowed to film and if you need any additional permits.
*   **C: Anumati ko bare anusandhan garnu** (Research about authorization) - The passage explicitly advises to check what you are allowed to film and if you need any additional permits."
Anuchhed anusar drone dwara video khichna sabai bhanda upayukta sthan kaha chhan?,"The best answer, based on the paragraph, is **D: Agrim anumati lieyeko kshetra maa (Areas where prior permission has been obtained)**.

Here's why:

*   The paragraph emphasizes checking what you are allowed to film and obtaining necessary permits or authorizations, especially when using a drone.

Let's examine why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bhid najik taki drone ko upasthiti le kunai farak naparos (Near crowds so that the presence of the drone makes no difference)**: The passage explicitly states that flying drones near crowds is generally a bad idea, even if not illegal.
*   **B: Niyamit photograhy ko anumati nabhaeka kshetra (Areas where regular photography is not permitted)**: The passage states if photography isn't permitted, video is likely also not permitted, and even more restricted.
*   **C: Drone tyati nadekhine vyasta thauma (Busy places where the drone is not so visible)**: While the paragraph doesn't specifically say you *mustn't* fly a drone in a busy place, it strongly implies that flying near crowds is a bad idea.

Therefore, the most suitable place for drone video recording, according to the passage, is an area where you have **prior permission**."

Bhraman ko bela swayamsewak ko kam garera kaslai faida hudaina?,"The passage states that volunteering abroad can be a good way to experience different cultures, meet new people, learn about yourself, gain perspective, and acquire new skills. It also mentions that many volunteer opportunities provide room and board, and sometimes even a small salary, allowing people to travel on a budget.

Based on this, let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Videsh maa naya sathi banauna chahanele (Someone who wants to make new friends abroad):** The passage explicitly mentions meeting new people as a benefit of volunteering abroad. So, volunteering helps them.
*   **B: Paryapta talab kamaune aash garnele (Someone who expects to earn a sufficient salary):** The passage only mentions a *small* salary sometimes being paid. So, someone expecting a *sufficient* salary would likely *not* benefit, or even be dissatisfied.
*   **C: Naya ship sikna chahanele (Someone who wants to learn new skills):** The passage mentions acquiring new skills as a benefit. So, volunteering helps them.
*   **D: Kotha ra khana maa ruchi rakhnele (Someone who is interested in room and board):** The passage mentions that many volunteer positions provide room and board. So, volunteering helps them.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Paryapta talab kamaune aash garnele** since the text suggests the pay would likely be insufficient for someone hoping for a sufficient salary."
Anuchhed anusar budget maa videsh bhraman garne yatru ko lagi swayamsewa kasari faidajanak chha?,"The correct answer is **C: Kahile kahi kotha ra khana pradan garinchha**.

The paragraph states: ""Kinky dherai swayamsevak rojgariharule kotha ra board pradan gardachan ra kehile thorai talab pani bhuktan gardachan."" (Many volunteer jobs provide room and board and sometimes even pay a small salary.)

This directly supports option C.  The other options are not as specifically supported by the text in relation to budgeting for travel:

*   **A: Talab lagbhag sadhai pradan garinchha** (Salary is almost always provided) - The paragraph says salary is provided *sometimes*, not almost always.
*   **B: Yasle kam ko awasar sirjana garchha** (It creates job opportunities) - While this is true, it doesn't directly address the benefit to a budget traveler.
*   **D: Yasle tapailai naya drishtikon pradan garna sakchha** (It can provide you with a new perspective) - This is a general benefit of volunteering abroad, but not directly related to budgeting."

The passage explicitly states that Disney prohibits transferring tickets: ""tikatharu sthanantaran garna yogya chhainan"" (tickets are non-transferable). The other options are implied or directly mentioned in the passage as being related to Walt Disney World experiences.
"

So, the correct answer is **A: Banjar bhumi maa kasari baachne**.
"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun vishaya vyavasaayik prasikshan ko kaksha maa utaaine sambhawana huncha?,"The correct answer is **A: Prathamik upachhar**.

Here's why:

*   The paragraph explicitly mentions that a course includes ""thuprai prathamik upchar"" (lots of first aid) as part of the training.
*   The paragraph discusses ""Yuddha khetra"" as the context for the training, but not as a direct subject taught in the classroom.
*   ""Banjar bhumi maa kasari baachne"" or ""Jungle ra prakriti bachaunaka lagi prakashit pustak ra patrikaharu"" are only mentioned in the last sentence.
*   ""Shatrutapurna watawaran"" is mentioned as the name of the course, but the question asks about what is specifically taught within the course.

Therefore, **Prathamik upachhar (First Aid)** is the only option directly stated as a component of the professional training described in the paragraph."
Anuchhed anusar sambhaavit rupmaa dushit pani bata jogina ramro vikalpa ke ho?,"Sahi jawab ho **B: Bottle ko pani kinnu**

Anuchhed anusar dakshya paudibaaj ko lagi pani kun kura jhandai asambhav hunchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Bahav ko virudhamaa paudanu**.

The passage states: ""Dheraijaso mrityuharu thakaiko parinamswarup chhalko praaha viruddha paudin khojnale garda hunchhan june asambhawa huna sakdachha."" This directly translates to: ""Most deaths occur as a result of trying to swim against the current of the wave which can be impossible due to fatigue.""

Therefore, swimming against the current is nearly impossible, even for a skilled swimmer, due to the resulting fatigue.
"
Yadi bahaav maa adkiyemaa ke garnu parchha?,"Based on the provided text, the best answer is **A: Arko dishaa tarfa nishaana banaaera bahaav baata baahira niskane prayas garnu parchha ra tyaspachhi kinaar maa saamanya rupmaa paudanu parchha (Aim towards another direction to get out of the current and then swim normally to the shore).**

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly mentions that trying to swim against the current leads to exhaustion and is often impossible. This eliminates options B and C.
*   The text doesn't mention swimming underwater (option D) as a solution.
*   The provided text indicates that you should aim for a place where you can wait for rescue and regain your strengths.

Therefore, the most logical and safest approach based on the passage is to try and swim out of the current's pull by aiming in a direction away from it, and then once you're free, swim towards the shore normally."

Anuchhed maa varnan garieko kshetra anusar mahila yaatri kaa laagi kun sujhaav sahayogi hunchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Nachaahine vyavahaar ko sambandhamaa purush aswikaar garna dridh bannu ho**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage emphasizes the importance of women being assertive and standing their ground against unwanted advances.** It advises women to be firm in appearing strong to men, even if cultural differences exist. The passage explicitly says, ""Purushharulai kamjor dekhauna dridha hunuhos ra afno sthan khada garna nadarauna hundaina (sanskritik bhinnata nabhae panni yasale thik banaundaina!)."" which translates to ""Be firm in making men look weak and don't be afraid to stand your ground (even if there are no cultural differences, this is the right thing to do!)."" Therefore option D resonates closely with this aspect.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kasaile pichha garnu asaamanya ho** - While the passage implies that unwanted attention might be common, it doesn't directly say that stalking is unusual. Rather, it provides advice on how to handle such situations.

*   **B: Vaivaahik sthiti janaauna thulo aaunthi lagaaunu** - The passage does suggest wearing a ring to appear married, but it clarifies that the ring doesn't need to be expensive. So, the ""thulo"" (big) ring specification is misleading.

*   **C: Saanskritik bhinnata ko kaaran le aafno kura maa adig bhaera basi narahanu** - The passage advises women to understand cultural differences regarding harassment, but it doesn't suggest being less assertive. It encourages being assertive *despite* cultural differences.

Ancuhhed anusar kun awasthama wanyajantu ko photgrapher ko laagi visesh lens ko prayog aawashyak hunchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Sana jantu ko photo khichne bela**.

The passage states: ""Wildlife photographyka lagi praya: lamo telephoto lensko awashyak pareta pani charaharuko bathan wa sanah prani jasta chijlai any prakarka lensharu chahinchha.""

This translates to: ""While long telephoto lenses are often needed for wildlife photography, other types of lenses are required for things like bird flocks or small animals.""

Anuchhed maa yea madhye wanyajantu ko photographer ko laagi kun kura sambhawit chunauti kaa rupmaa ullkeh garieko chhaina?,"The correct answer is **C: Aawashyak lens ko prakar baare shrot khojda**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Visesh janawaar haru ko khoji (Searching for specific animals)** - The passage mentions that many endangered animals are hard to find (""Dherai lopanmukh janawarharu bhettauna gahro hunchha."")
*   **B: Aakramak janawaar ko saamana garda (Dealing with aggressive animals)** - The passage states that wild animals can be shy or aggressive (""Jungli janawarharu lajalu wa akramak hoon sakchhan."").
*   **D: Pratikul watavaran maa kam garda (Working in unfavorable environments)** - The passage mentions that the environment can be cold, hot, or hostile (""watawaran chiso, tato wa shatrutapurna huna sakcha."").

The passage discusses the *need* for different types of lenses, but it does *not* mention the *difficulty in finding sources of information about what lenses are needed*. It only highlights that long telephoto lenses are often necessary, but other types are needed for things like insects."
Yea madhye kun kura le himali kshetra maa sawari chalaune ko laagi kam samasya nimtyauna sakchha?,"The passage discusses the following challenges of driving in high altitude and snowy regions:

*   Snow, ice, and freezing temperatures
*   Reduced friction on icy and snowy roads
*   Potential for being stranded by blizzards
*   Limited visibility due to snow accumulation or blowing snow

Now, let's examine the options:

*   **A: Traffic ko chaap (Traffic pressure):** The passage mentions that traffic jams occur in many countries due to snow and ice conditions, so traffic is a problem.
*   **B: Kam gharshan (Low friction):** The passage explicitly states that low friction on icy and snowy roads is a problem.
*   **C: Uccha sakshepan (High capacity)** This option is irrelevant to driving safety and does not fit the overall context
*   **D: Kam drishyata (Low visibility):** The passage mentions that snow can obstruct visibility, making it a problem.

The question asks for the factor that is *less* of a problem. Given the information, **traffic ko chaap (traffic pressure)** would typically be less impactful than reduced friction and decreased visibility.

So the answer is A."
Vibhinna desh harumaa aaya kar sambandhi kun kura saman rahanchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Samrachana (Structure)**.

Here's why:

*   **P explains that rates (dar), brackets (kosthak), and registration places (darta garne thaau) for income tax vary between countries, and even within some countries at different levels (e.g., federal vs. local).**
*   **Samrachana (Structure)** refers to the system or organization of income tax. While the specifics (rates, brackets) change, the fundamental structure of *having* an income tax system is common across countries. Most countries have a legal framework for income tax, define taxable income, and have methods for collection and enforcement.

Therefore, while *how* income tax is implemented varies, the underlying *structure* of having an income tax system is a common feature.

Anuchhed anusar yadi tapai anta katai adharit bhaera videsh maa kam garirahanu bhaeko chha bhane tapaile kaha aafno aaya kar bujhaaune sambhawana hunchha?,"Correct answer is **C: Tapai le tatkal kam gariraheko deshmaa**

**Explanation:**

The passage states: ""Tapain kutnitigya nabhaesamma videshma kaam garnuko matlab tapainle afu baseko deshma ayakar halnu parne hunchha."" This translates to ""Unless you are a diplomat, working abroad means you have to pay income tax in the country where you are based.""

Therefore, the correct answer is C, the country where you are currently working.
"
Vishwa mela lai yea madhe kun vakyale sahi rupmaa janaudaina?,"The correct answer is **D: Rashtra harule bhag lina aawashyak chhaina**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that participating countries (""Sahabhagi deshharule"") present artistic and educational displays. This implies that nations are *required* to participate for the event to function as intended, contrary to option D.
*   The passage supports statements A, B, and C:
    *   A is stated directly (""tiniharuka deshka sanskriti ra itihas dekhauna rashtriya stambhaharuma"").
    *   B is supported by the text saying antarrashtriya bagwani pradarshan vishesh karyakramharu hun jasle fulharuko pradarshan, botanical bagaincha ra botabiruwasanga sambandhit kuraharuko pradarshan gardachan, meaning it's shown at the same time.
    *   C is supported by ""yea ghatanaharu samanyataya kahin pani tindekhi cha mahinaka bichma rahanchhan""."
Yea madhye vishwa mela wa antarashtriya pradarshan ko niyam kun ho?,"The correct answer is **C: Karyakram cha mahina samma huna sakchhan** (The program can last up to six months).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Yea ghatanaharu samanyataya kahin pani tindekhi cha mahinaka bichma rahanchhan..."" which translates to ""These events usually last anywhere between three to six months...""
*   A is incorrect because the passage states that participating countries show both their national culture and history as well as world issues.
*   B is incorrect because the text states that in principle it can be held annually, as long as it's in different countries.
*   D is incorrect because the text doesn't say all countries have to participate. It says ""Sahabhagi deshharule..."" (Participating countries...)

"
Yea madhye ke garnale janawar ko akraman hune sambhawana kam rahanchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Camp sthal baata fohor nikaalnale** (Removing garbage from the campsite).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""savadhan rahanuhos key gandhale bhalu ra any wanyajantuharulai akarshit gardacha, tyasaile gandha yukta khana bokne wa pakaune karya nagarnuhos ra shivir safa rakhnuhos."" (Be careful because smells attract bears and other wildlife, so don't carry or cook smelly food and keep the camp clean.) This directly links keeping the campsite clean (removing garbage) to reducing the likelihood of attracting animals, hence decreasing the chance of an attack.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sugandhamaya jadibuti boknaale** (Carrying fragrant herbs) - The passage warns against carrying anything with a strong scent, so this would increase the risk of attracting animals.
*   **C: Bwaso bata 25 yard ko duri rakhnale** (Keeping 25 yards away from wolves) - The passage states to keep at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, so this distance is not far enough to keep safe from wolves.
*   **D: Janawar lai khana ko tukra haru diera** (Giving pieces of food to animals) - The passage specifically warns against feeding or provoking wildlife. Feeding them can make them reliant on humans and potentially aggressive if they want more food."
Yi madhye kun kura anuchhedmaa jungli wanyajantu ko aakraman ko sambhawit karan ko rup maa ullekh garieko chhaina?,"The correct answer is **A: kadha sugandha**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that strong scents can attract bears and other wildlife, which could lead to encounters, but it does not mention strong scents as a trigger for them to be aggressive.
*   The passage lists failure to maintain a safe distance from wildlife, feeding wildlife, and the wild nature of these animals (making them prone to aggression) as reasons for attacks.
*   The passage highlights the wild and unpredictable nature of the animals as a source of potential danger.
*   The passage lists bison, elk, moose, bears and pretty much all large animals looking tame but they can still attack.

Therefore, of the given choices, only option **A: kadha sugandha** is not listed as a direct reason for potential wild animal attacks."
