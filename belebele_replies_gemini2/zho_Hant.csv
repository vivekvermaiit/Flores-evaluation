以下何者並未正確反映波貝克在貝爾格萊德游擊隊的職業生涯？,"The correct answer is **A: 他在為球隊效力期間踢進超過 468 個進球**.

Here's why:

* **P states:** Bobek played 468 games and scored 403 goals. Option A is false because he scored 403 goals, not over 468.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **D: 他在獲選為游擊隊最佳球員後名聲大噪 (He became famous after being chosen as the best Partizan player)** The passage states he became famous *while* playing for Partizan Belgrade. The ""best player"" selection was much later."
根據文章，哪個特徵讓伊氏西爪龍有別於迅猛龍？,"正確答案是 **B: 牠第二隻爪比較大**。

文章中提到伊氏西爪龍和迅猛龍都以帶爪的雙腳直立行走、全身覆蓋羽毛、且是溫血動物。只有「第二隻爪比較大」這個特徵是專屬於伊氏西爪龍的，也是它名字「西方之爪」的由來。
"
「西爪龍」的含義源自該物種的什麼身體特徵？,"The correct answer is **A: 爪子**.

The passage states ""牠的第二隻爪比較大，使牠獲得西爪龍的封號，意指「西方之爪」."" This directly links the name ""西爪龍"" (Western Claw) to the animal's claw.

Here's why:

*   The text states the husband was killed in a shooting, and he was a Buffalo native.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the ship had ""120 to 160 cubic meters"" of fuel. Option B says it had 100 cubic meters, which is outside that range and therefore incorrect.

"
葬禮在哪裡舉行？,"The correct answer is **C: 在聖伯多祿廣場**.

"
愛爾蘭政府計劃做什麼？,"根據文章，愛爾蘭政府強調議會立法改正現況的迫切性，且衛生部長關切毒品相關犯罪的判決。 因此，最符合的選項是：

**B: 引入更嚴格的毒品容許度法律**

原因：政府想要「改正現況」，且關切毒品相關犯罪判決，代表他們想要限制或規範毒品，而非放寬或除罪化。 引入更嚴格的法律，是改正現況並處理犯罪判決最合理的方式。
"
在愛爾蘭，什麼是暫時合法的？,"The correct answer is **D: 毒品**.

*   **D: 在課堂上使用髒話 (Using swear words in class)**: The passage states ""據說他在課堂上也會講粗話"" and ""他在筆記中使用了某些家長視為髒話的字眼"" - It is mentioned he allegedly did this.
*   **B: 與學生交往 (Having relationships with students)**: The passage does say ""他跟學生亦師亦友"" - He has a friendly teacher-student relationship.
    There's no accusation or implication that he engaged in inappropriate *romantic* relationships with his students."

"

"

"
根據維薩切的說法，最強的風是什麼時候開始的？,"The correct answer is **A: 表演開始後數分鐘**.

"
在弗雷德之前，在 35°W 以東記錄了多少個重大颶風？,"The passage states that Fred is the third strongest hurricane ever recorded east of 35°W. This means there were two hurricanes *before* Fred that were stronger.

"

"
以下何者的速度比其前代更快？,"正確答案是 **A: 802.11n**。

理由：

根據給出的文字，802.11n 的速度比過去的設備都快。選項 B、C 和 D 都是 802.11n 的前代標準，因此 802.11n 是唯一符合條件的選項。
"
802.11n 與 802.11b 兼容需要什麼條件？,"The correct answer is **D: 雙射頻**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""If a base station has dual radios, this will make it backward compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g."" Dual radios mean the base station can operate on different frequencies simultaneously, allowing older devices (like those using 802.11b) to connect.
*   The passage states: 802.11n operates on 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz frequencies.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 明顯更快的速度:** While 802.11n is faster, speed isn't the *requirement* for compatibility.
*   **B: 讓 802.11b 能在 5.0Ghz 上運作的能力:** 802.11b only operates on the 2.4GHz frequency.
*   **C: 600Mbit/s 的傳輸量:** 600Mbit/s is the *potential* speed of 802.11n, not a compatibility requirement."
這位奧運金牌選手原本要在大英國協運動會參加幾場游泳比賽？,"答案是 **A: 五場**

題目說明這位奧運金牌選手要參加「100 公尺和 200 公尺自由式比賽，以及三項游泳接力賽」，總共是 2 (自由式) + 3 (接力) = 5 場比賽。
"
為什麼奧運金牌選手沒有服用藥物來止痛？,"正確答案是: **D: 大英國協運動會不允許使用此藥物**

理由：

原文提到「奧運會禁止使用那些藥物」。雖然原文說的是奧運會，但題目問的是大英國協運動會。最接近且合理的推論是，這位選手不吃藥是因為**相關賽事** (這裡指大英國協運動會) 禁止使用那些藥物。

選項 A、B、C 都不符合原文內容，原文只有提到**奧運會**禁止使用特定藥物。"
根據文章，什麼可能會導致有關地震活動的混淆？,"The correct answer is **A: 烏雲的存在**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that there are reports of strange clouds at the foot of the mountain that are said to be unrelated to volcanic activity.
*   The passage then specifically mentions that these clouds ""might cause confusion"" and make it uncertain whether a volcanic eruption (which could involve seismic activity) is actually happening.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   B: The Icelandic Meteorological Office's report actually clarifies that there has been no seismic activity.
*   C: The international earthquake map corroborates the lack of seismic activity.
*   D: Other areas of Iceland is not mentioned."
根據文章，什麼時候發生了狀態改變？,"The correct answer is **C: 三月十日**

The passage states ""引發狀態改變的明顯地震活動發生於 3 月 10 日..."" which translates to ""Significant seismic activity that triggered a change in state occurred on March 10th...""
"
有關月船 1 號的月球探測器，以下哪個陳述不正確？,"根據段落 P，選項 A 的陳述 **不正確**。

月船 1 號是**無人**月球軌道探測器，因此沒有機組人員。其他選項都直接在段落 P 中提到。
"
關於月球探測器，以下哪個描述正確？,"The correct answer is **B: 它迫降成功 (It successfully crash-landed)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states the MIP ""crash-landed"" near the lunar south pole.
*   A is incorrect because it landed near the *south* pole.
*   C is incorrect because it was deployed from an *unmanned* orbiter.
*   D is incorrect because it carried *three* scientific instruments."
根據文章，哪項防範疾病的措施最後才會實施？,"The correct answer is **C: 腦炎疫苗 (Brain fever vaccine)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the plan to deliver vaccines to the hardest-hit areas was delayed due to lack of funds and lower priority compared to other diseases. This implies that the vaccine distribution will be the last measure to be implemented.
*   The passage states that capture squads, mosquito nets and insecticide have already been implemented."
這種疾病是如何傳染給人類的？,"The correct answer is **A: 蚊子 (Mosquitoes)**.

The passage clearly states that the disease ""存在於豬身上，然後透過蚊子傳播給人類 (exists in pigs and then spreads to humans through mosquitoes).""
"
第二條文宣判失敗可能會導致什麼結果？,"正確答案是 **B: 未來有權進行同性民事結合**

理由如下：

* 文章指出 ""禁止同性民事結合的提議經第二次宣判失敗，有可能開啟未來同性民事結合之門。"" 這直接表明了宣判失敗可能導致的結果。

其他選項不正確的原因：

* **A: 眾議院聯合決議 3 立即重新審查**  文章說明眾議院聯合決議 3 將在2015或2016年由下屆民選立法機構重新審查，並非立即重新審查。
* **C: 緊急立法會議** 文章沒有提到緊急立法會議。
* **D: 禁止同性民事結合** 文章明確指出，禁止的提議被宣判失敗，所以這個選項是相反的。
"
根據文章，第二條文是什麼時候被刪除的？,"The correct answer is **A: 在立法會議期間**.

The passage states that the amendment was modified ""在立法會議期間"" (during the legislative session) when the House removed Article 2.
"
「巴拿馬文件」洩露給誰？,"The correct answer is **B: 新聞媒體**.

The passage explicitly states that the Panama Papers were ""外洩給媒體的文件"" (leaked to the media).
"
根據文章，英國媒體聲稱誰在管理許多用於藏匿財富的公司？,"The correct answer is **C: 德意志銀行**

The passage states: ""英國報紙《衛報》暗指，用於實現此目的的 1,200 間空殼公司裡，德意志銀行控制了大約三分之一。"" This directly implicates Deutsche Bank in controlling a significant number of the shell companies used for hiding wealth.
"
以下哪一次航空事故造成的死亡人數最多？,"正確答案是 **A: 從伊朗飛往亞美尼亞的班機失事**。

文章中提到，這起事故造成了 168 人罹難，是死亡人數最多的航空事故。
"
以下哪一項不是伊朗發生多起航空事故的原因之一？,"根據文章內容：

*   **A: 老舊的民用和軍用飛機機隊：** 文章開頭就指出飛機年久失修，這是個原因。
*   **C: 制裁禁止購買新飛機：** 文章指出國際制裁導致無法購入新飛機，這是個原因。

選項 B 和 D 沒有直接在文章中提到。雖然缺乏預算和維護不良可能是老舊機隊和空難的原因，但文章中並沒有明確說明這些是直接原因。

因此，最合適的答案是：

**B: 沒有預算購買新飛機** 和 **D: 飛機機隊維護不良** (因為兩個選項在原文中都沒有被明確提及)。"
以下哪一項不包括在伊拉克研究小組的報告中？,"The correct answer is **B: 聲明透過某些改變就能避免伊拉克的暴力局勢加劇**.

Here's why:

*   The report explicitly states that ""no course of action at this point can guarantee"" preventing sectarian war, escalating violence, or chaos. This directly contradicts option B.
*   The passage mentions the report critiques current policy (A), makes recommendations to protect Iraq's borders (C), and calls for consensus in US Middle East policy (D)."
伊拉克研究小組的報告中未敦促以下哪一項？,"The correct answer is **A: 宣布保證阻止持續成長的暴力事件**.

The passage states that the Iraq Study Group *warned* that no course of action could *guarantee* the prevention of escalating violence. Therefore, the report would *not* urge guaranteeing the prevention of violence. The other options are mentioned in the passage as recommendations or findings of the report.
"
根據警方，誰被認為是普羅文察諾的左右手？,"The correct answer is **B: 洛·皮科洛**

The passage states: ""警方說，洛·皮科洛之所以佔了上風是因為他在巴勒莫曾擔任普羅文察諾的左右手..."". This directly identifies Lo Piccolo as Provenzano's right-hand man in Palermo.
"
根據文章提供的資訊，喬凡尼·法爾康的死因是什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 他在里納發動的戰爭中被殺害**.

The text states that Giovanni Falcone was killed in a conflict launched by Riina against the state.
"
以下何者不是齊藤仁的榮譽之一？,"The correct answer is **A: 兩次世界冠軍**.

"
岩崎想辦法避開在哪裡立下誓約？,"正確答案是 **B: 尼泊爾**。

根據P段文字，岩崎圭一在尼泊爾逃離了一場婚姻，所以他想辦法避開在尼泊爾立下誓約。
"
誰攻擊了岩崎？,"The correct answer is **B, C, and D**. The passage states that he was robbed by pirates, attacked by a dog, and arrested by police.

However, option C, ""A dog"", is more precise as it also mentions it was a rabid dog. But the other two still happened to him.
"
阿隆索在何時結束了他的比賽？,"The correct answer is **C: 在舒馬克結束自己的比賽後** (After Schumacher ended his race).

The passage states that Alonso's race ended shortly *before* Schumacher's. Therefore, Alonso's race ended *after* he left the pits.

Let's break it down:

*   Alonso led most of the race, then his race ended *after leaving the pits*.
*   Schumacher's race ended *after* Alonso's race, due to suspension damage.
* Since Schumacher ended his race after Alonso, Alonso's race ended *before* Schumacher's race. Therefore, Alonso ended his race **before** Schumacher ended his race."
是什麼原因導致舒馬克提前結束比賽？,"The correct answer is **D: 汽車懸吊系統損壞**

The passage states that ""麥可・舒馬克...也因為在比賽中多次與對手競速，造成懸吊系統損壞而結束了比賽.""
"
根據文章，誰負責為被捕人士決定保釋金？,"正確答案是 **D: 法院臨時法官**。

文章明確指出「如果獲得批准，**法院助理法官**會決定保釋金額...」。因此，負責決定保釋金的是法院助理法官。
"
根據文中提到的臨時禁制令，被捕人士必須達到什麼條件才能被拘留超過 24 小時？,"The correct answer is **D: 聽證會**

Here's why:

The passage states that the temporary restraining order requires the release of people detained for over 24 hours *without* receiving notice of a preliminary hearing. This implies that if a hearing is scheduled, detention beyond 24 hours *is* permissible. The hearing determines bail and formally enters charges into the system.
"
根據這段文字，沒有使用以下哪個原因來解釋取消決選？,"The correct answer is **B: 與憲法牴觸 (Conflicting with the constitution)**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 安全風險 (Security risks)**: The text explicitly mentions that the decision to cancel the second round was partly to avoid security risks associated with another election.
*   **C: 高昂的開支 (High costs)**: The text explicitly mentions that the decision was partly to save Afghanistan money.
*   **D: 憲法的不明確性 (Constitutional ambiguity)**: The text explicitly mentions that diplomats found enough ambiguity in the Afghan constitution to justify canceling the runoff.
*   **B: 與憲法牴觸 (Conflicting with the constitution)**: The text actually states the *opposite*. The decision to cancel the election was made *despite* previous reports that canceling it would be unconstitutional. The constitutional ambiguity was used as a justification to *avoid* the conflict, not as a reason *for* the cancellation.

Therefore, conflicting with the constitution was not a reason used to explain the cancellation of the runoff.
"
為什麼外交官最終認為決選投票是沒有必要的？,"The correct answer is **C: 憲法存在不明確的地方**

The passage states: ""外交人員說他們已在阿富汗憲法中找到足夠的歧義，因此決定沒有必要進行決選投票."" This directly translates to ""Diplomats said they found enough ambiguity in the Afghan constitution, and therefore decided that a run-off vote was unnecessary.""
"
誰為聯邦直轄部落地區提供司法服務？,"根據文章，政治代理人負責治理與**提供司法服務**。 因此，正確答案是：

**B: 政治代理人**
"
關於聯邦直轄部落地區「政治代理人」的敘述，以下何者為非？,"The correct answer is **D: 他們對特定地區擁有完全控制權 (They have complete control over specific regions)**.

While the passage states they have *almost* complete autonomy, it doesn't say they have *complete* control. This is a subtle but important distinction. The passage states they need to provide judicial services so A is true. They are appointed by the president so B is true. They need to do so according to the Constitution so C is true.

Therefore, D is the only statement that is demonstrably false based on the information provided.
"
請問艾瑪·史東被提名哪個獎項？,"The correct answer is **C: 最佳女演員 (Best Actress)**.

The passage explicitly states that ""雷恩‧葛斯林和艾瑪‧史東分別獲提名為最佳男主角和最佳女主角 (Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were nominated for Best Actor and Best Actress respectively).""
"
該電影沒有被提名哪個獎項？,"根據題目敘述，以下是各選項的狀態：

*   **A: 最佳影片:** 電影有被提名。
*   **B: 最佳視覺效果:** 題目中沒有提到這部電影有被提名最佳視覺效果獎。
*   **C: 最佳混音:** 電影有被提名。
*   **D: 最佳原創歌曲:** 電影有被提名。

因此，正確答案是 **B: 最佳視覺效果**
"
地震後，哪些設施繼續運作？,"The correct answer is **D: 新潟的一座發電廠**

Here's why:

*   The text states that the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant in Niigata Prefecture was operating normally at the time of the earthquake.
*   The text says that the Shika Nuclear Power Plant's reactors were shut down.
*   The text also mentions that the airport is closed, and rail service is disrupted.

"
根據這段文字，以下何者因地震受損？,"Based on the text, the correct answer is:

*   **C: 部分道路**

The text explicitly states: ""部分道路已受損..."". The other options are either false or not directly stated as being damaged by the earthquake.
"
根據這段文字，文件中沒有包含以下哪個問題？,"The correct answer is **B: 1967 年戰爭的原因**.

The paragraph explicitly mentions the document addresses the following:

*   **A: 耶路撒冷的未來**: ""...兩國共同聖城耶路撒冷的未來走向...""
*   **C: 河谷駐軍**: ""...約旦河谷問題. 以色列要求...將繼續在約旦河谷駐軍十年，而巴勒斯坦自治政府則同意駐軍只保留五年.""
*   **D: 關於邊界的糾紛**: ""...巴勒斯坦希望以 1967 年中東戰爭之前的邊界為基礎這樁邊界糾紛.""

The paragraph doesn't mention anything about the *causes* of the 1967 war, only that the Palestinians want to use the pre-1967 borders as a basis for negotiation.
"
下列何者並非巴勒斯坦的要求？,"正確答案是 **B: 繼續在約旦河谷駐軍**

巴勒斯坦的要求包括：

*   **A: 以戰前邊界為基礎** (文件提到巴勒斯坦希望以 1967 年中東戰爭之前的邊界為基礎解決邊界糾紛)
*   **C: 有關耶路撒冷的未來的答案** (文件提到兩國共同聖城耶路撒冷的未來走向)
*   **D: 在約旦河谷持續五年的駐軍** (巴勒斯坦自治政府同意駐軍只保留五年)

相反，繼續在約旦河谷駐軍十年的要求是以色列提出的，不是巴勒斯坦的要求。"
馬英九在哪個國家學法律？,"The correct answer is **A: 美國**.

The text states that Ma Ying-jeou attended Harvard Law School, which is in the United States.
"
根據這段文字，馬英九因擁護哪個國家所助得以勝選？,"The correct answer is **D: 中國 (China)**.

The passage states that Ma Ying-jeou ""easily won with a platform advocating closer ties with mainland China."" This directly indicates that his position on relations with China was a key factor in his victory.
"
在文章中提到，Carolyn Wilson 離開小鎮前為誰工作？,"The correct answer is C: 奧克蘭房屋委員會

The text states: ""...奧克蘭房屋委員會的 Carolyn Wilson 偷走他們的保證金並已捲款潛逃.""
"
在賽季仍剩四場賽事的情況下，誰在車手錦標賽排名第四？,"基於題中資訊，漢姆林名列第三，波伊爾落後漢姆林五分，因此波伊爾名列第四。

所以，正確答案是：**D: 波伊爾**
"
文中提到比賽結束後，卡恩在車手錦標賽中獲得多少分？,"The correct answer is **A: 2220 分**.

The passage states that ""卡恩和小楚克斯分別以 2220 分和 2207 分位居第五和第六名"".
"
根據這段文字，人類看到掉落的隕石，後來證實是來自火星的情況有幾次？,"The passage states: ""It is believed to be the fifth time in history that humans have found and chemically confirmed Martian material falling to Earth.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: 5 次** (5 times).
"
如文中所提，關於已發現是來自火星的岩石，何者為真？,"The correct answer is **D: 共有 34 個 (共有 34 個)**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""地球上將近兩萬四千顆已知的隕石中，只有 34 顆確定來自火星 (Of the nearly 24,000 known meteorites on Earth, only 34 are confirmed to be from Mars).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 全都是在七月的流星雨期間發現的 (All were discovered during a meteor shower in July)** - The passage mentions 15 of the 34 were found during a July meteor shower, not all of them.
*   **B: 共有 24000 個 (There are 24000 in total)** - This is the total number of meteorites found on Earth, not just Martian meteorites.
*   **C: 其價值比黃金還要高出 $11000 美元 (Their value is $11000 higher than gold)** - The range of $11,000 to $22,500 per ounce is their total price, which is about 10 times the price of gold. It's not a difference *above* the price of gold."
舒馬克是何時退休的？,"The correct answer is **B: 在他第七次贏得冠軍之後**

The passage states: ""曾七度贏得一級方程式冠軍，已於 2006 年退休的舒馬克..."" which translates to ""Schumacher, who had won the Formula One championship seven times and retired in 2006...""  This clearly indicates he retired after winning his seventh championship.
"
馬薩是何時受傷的？,"The correct answer is **D: 2009 年賽季前**

The passage states that Massa was injured at the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix, which is part of the 2009 season. So, the injury happened *before* the season was over (meaning before the end of the 2009 season), and thus *before* the 2009 season ended.
"
根據這段文字，這個安排會如何影響 AOL？,"The correct answer is **C: 雅虎和微軟客戶加總將可匹敵 AOL 的客戶數量 (Yahoo and Microsoft customers combined will rival the number of AOL customers)**.

The passage explicitly states that the combined user base of Yahoo and Microsoft services will rival AOL's customer numbers. This is a direct restatement of information presented in the passage.
"
以下何者可能會於新安排後結束？,"The correct answer is **C: AOL 自主發展市場的自由**.

Here's why:

*   **Premise (P):** AOL currently has the freedom to develop the instant messaging market at its own pace because it has a large US user base. This freedom is threatened because Yahoo and Microsoft combined have a similar user base.
*   **Question (Q):** What might end under the new arrangement?

The passage explicitly states that AOL's freedom *might* end due to increased competition from a combined Yahoo/Microsoft presence. Therefore, option C directly reflects the potential consequence described in the premise.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **A: 美國普遍的網路發展:** This is too broad and not directly linked to the information provided. The passage focuses on the instant messaging market, not the overall development of the internet in the US.
*   **B: 即時通訊市場的使用:** The passage suggests *increased* competition in the instant messaging market, not its end.
*   **D: 雅虎和微軟的合作夥伴關係:** While the passage implies a potential alliance, it doesn't suggest that the *partnership* itself will end. The focus is on the *impact* of their combined user base."
在攻擊中喪生的人有多少個不是警察？,"**C: 0 人**

**理由：**

* 新聞中提到「兩名員警死亡」。
* 新聞中提到「傷患中有十九名是警察」。
* 問題問的是「在攻擊中喪生的人有多少個不是警察？」
* 因為死亡的都是警察，所以沒有非警察在攻擊中喪生。"
是誰舉報攻擊事件的嫌疑犯？,"The correct answer is **A: 警方**.

The passage states: ""警方說，他們懷疑這起攻擊是由達伊沙（伊拉克和黎凡特伊斯蘭國）的好戰嫌疑犯所為。"" (The police said they suspect the attack was carried out by militant suspects from Daesh (Islamic State in Iraq and Levant)).
"
由於佛羅里達州是一個贏者全拿的州，米特·羅姆尼贏得了什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 該州的所有代表**.

The passage explicitly states: ""作為贏者全拿的州，佛羅里達州的五十名代表全數歸予羅姆尼..."" (As a winner-take-all state, all fifty of Florida's delegates went to Romney...). While the number of delegates is slightly off (the passage mentions 50, the options imply 32 or 50), option C most accurately reflects the information provided in the passage about the ""winner-take-all"" rule.
"
根據這段文字，金瑞契在初選中獲得了多少百分比的選票？,"正確答案是 **B: 0.32**

這段文字明確說明紐特‧金瑞契獲得了 32% 的選票，這等同於 0.32。
"
根據這段文字，在公布預選會議結果之後，誰沒有繼續競選？,"The correct answer is **B: 巴克曼**.

The passage states that Bachmann ""決定終止競選"" (decided to end her campaign). The other candidates either continued or the text implies they continued (Romney).
"
根據這段文字，在公布預選會議結果之後，誰對另一位候選人給予了高度評價？,"The correct answer is **B: 金瑞契 (Kim Gingrich)**.

The passage states that 金瑞契 congratulated 桑托榮 (Santorum) after the results were announced.
"
在 2015 年之前，唯一播出該節目的地方在哪裡？,"正確答案是 **A: TogiNet 網路電台**

原文明確指出 ""早期，這個節目只有在一個經營許久的網路電台 TogiNet 上播出""，而 AstroNet 電台是在 2015 年末才成立的，所以 2015 年之前只有 TogiNet 播出該節目。
"
該電台描述節目具有什麼樣的反轉？,"The correct answer is **B: 古怪**

The website describes the show as having ""extremely quirky twists."" ""Quirky"" translates to ""古怪"" in Chinese.
"

關於文中提到的納達爾與拉奧尼奇在布里斯本公開賽，哪一種敘述能正確表達出他們交手的結果？,"The correct answer is **A: 拉奧尼奇擊敗納達爾**

The text says ""He recently lost to Raonic in the Brisbane International."" This clearly states that Raonic won the match against Nadal.
"
根據這段文字，納達爾和拉奧尼奇在比賽首發後的戰績如何？,"The correct answer is **D: 拉奧尼奇擊敗納達爾 (Raonic defeated Nadal)**.

Here's why:

*   The text states ""He recently lost to Raonic at the Brisbane Open."" This directly indicates Raonic won the match.

Let's look at the other options:

*   A: 拉奧尼奇拿下了 88% 的網前分 (Raonic won 88% of net points) - The text says Nadal won 88% of net points.
*   B: 納達爾贏得 76 分 (Nadal won 76 points) - The text says Nadal won 76% of his first serve points, not a total of 76 points.
*   C: 比分是 7-2 (The score is 7-2) - This refers to the overall head-to-head record between the two players, not the result of this specific match."
裸體新聞的三個新廣播節目中，不包括哪種語言的節目？,"The correct answer is **C: 日語**.

The passage states that Naked News already has English and Japanese coverage. The three new broadcasts are in Spanish, Italian, and Korean.
"
根據這段文字，哪裡不會播出裸體新聞的新廣播節目？,"正確答案是 **C: 劇院**。

題目中提到新節目會在電視、網路和行動裝置上播出。劇院並未提及，因此是答案。
"
有多少參賽者沒有完成大迴轉賽？,"The correct answer is **D: 45 人**.

The passage states: ""在大迴轉賽的 117 位滑雪者中，有 45 位未在比賽中獲得排名."" This means 45 racers did not finish the giant slalom.
"
以下哪項陳述正確表達了錦標賽賽事的結果？,"Let's analyze each statement based on the provided text:

*   **A: 在第二場比賽中，卡潘內多在匈牙利滑雪者之前完成比賽** - The text states that Carpanedo finished the Giant Slalom (大迴轉賽) in 10th place and Gyöngyi Dani (the Hungarian skier) finished in 9th place. This means Dani finished *before* Carpanedo. So, this statement is incorrect.
*   **B: 在大迴轉賽中，有 45 名滑雪者沒有完成比賽** - The text states: ""在大迴轉賽的 117 位滑雪者中，有 45 位未在比賽中獲得排名"". We also know that four didn't finish the team event. The 45 who didn't get a rank *could* have completed the race (they may have been disqualified for some other reason), but the question asks about completion, and the number of incompletes is not given. So, this statement is most likely incorrect.
*   **C: 完成大迴轉賽的滑雪者人數多於小迴轉賽** - The text states that 116 skiers participated in the Slalom, and 36 did not complete the race. The text states that 117 skiers participated in the Giant Slalom, and 45 did not get a rank. The total number of skiers who started the Slalom = 116; the number of skiers who finished the slalom = 116 - 36 = 80. The total number of skiers who started the Giant Slalom = 117; the number of skiers who finished the Giant Slalom = 117 - 45 = 72. More skiers finished the Slalom than the Giant Slalom. So this statement is incorrect.
*   **D: 卡潘內多在小迴轉賽中獲得第十名** - The text states that Carpanedo did not finish (未完賽) the first run of the Slalom. This means she did not get 10th, or any other placing. So this statement is incorrect.

However, the text says, ""在大迴轉賽的 117 位滑雪者中，有 45 位未在比賽中獲得排名。"" This statement is most likely referring to not finishing, therefore **B** is the most probable correct answer.

**Therefore, the correct answer is B.**"
美國國家籃球協會 (NBA) 決定暫停以下何者的活動？,"The correct answer is **A: 籃球賽季**.

The passage states that the NBA suspended ""its professional basketball season"".
"
根據這段文字，是什麼引發了美國國家籃球協會對病毒的擔憂？,"正確答案是 **D: 一名猶他爵士隊球員確診新冠病毒**

段落明確指出，一名猶他爵士隊球員確診新冠病毒是 NBA 暫停賽季的原因。 其他選項雖然部分包含正確資訊（例如涉及爵士隊和新冠病毒），但都不是觸發 NBA 行動的直接原因。
"
在對陣亞特蘭大鶇鳥的比賽中，誰為華盛頓首都隊射進了致勝球？,"正確答案是 A: 尼可拉斯·巴克斯卓。

段落中明確指出「奧維琴根當晚第一記助攻，就獻給新人尼可拉斯‧巴克斯卓打進的那顆致勝球」。
"
在首都隊對陣亞特蘭大鶇鳥的比賽中，誰射進了他本賽季的第 60 個進球？,"正確答案是 C: 亞歷克斯·歐維契金。

段落中明確指出：「他當晚的第二次射門得分，是他在該賽季的第 60 次得分...」。
"
北岩銀行何時需要政府支援？,"The correct answer is **D: 房貸危機期間**.

The passage states that Northern Rock requested assistance due to the subprime mortgage crisis in 2007. This was *before* nationalization, the Virgin Group's bid, and the split into ""good bank"" and ""bad bank"".
"
根據這段文字，關於維珍集團與北岩銀行的交易，以下說法何者正確？,"The correct answer is **None of the above**. Here's why:

*   **A: 維珍集團也收購了北岩的資產管理公司:** The text explicitly states that 維珍集團 *did not* purchase the asset management company (the ""bad bank"").
*   **B: 維珍集團在銀行國有化後收購了該銀行:** The text states 維珍集團 attempted to purchase the bank *before* it was nationalized. They eventually purchased the ""good bank"" portion of Northern Rock after its nationalization and split into two entities, but not the entire nationalized entity.
*   **C: 維珍集團在房貸危機期間為銀行提供緊急支援:** The text says the bank requested assistance due to the mortgage crisis. 維珍集團 offered to buy the bank, but didn't provide emergency support in the form of a bailout.
*   **D: 維珍集團首次競標該銀行是在該銀行國有化後進行的:** The text states that 維珍集團 bid for the bank *before* nationalization.

Therefore, none of the statements accurately reflect the information provided in the text."
如文中所述，哪個國家受到《京都氣候協定》簽署的影響？,"根據文章，**A: 美國** 是正確答案。

文章明確指出，陸克文簽署京都議定書使美國成為唯一沒有批准該協議的已開發國家，因此受到影響（被孤立）。
"
澳洲前政府認為批准《京都氣候協定》會對什麼造成傷害？,"The correct answer is **B: 該國的經濟**.

The passage states that the Australian government refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol because it claimed it would damage their economy. While coal exports (C) are related, the broader concern was the overall economic impact.
"
控制補強試驗的狩獵者是為哪個計畫招募的？,"The correct answer is **D: 射擊運動協會的狩獵計劃**

The passage states that the hunters were recruited ""under the Shooting Sports Council's hunting program.""
"
哪種說法不能正確表達害蟲控制試驗？,"The correct answer is **A: 由於此為該計劃的首次試驗，因此未進行評估**.

Here's why:

*   **P** states: ""參與有害動物控制補強試驗的狩獵者會受到國家公園管理員之緊密監督，因相關單位需要監控並評估此試驗的績效."" This directly contradicts option A, which says no evaluation is being done.

The other options are supported by the text:

*   **B:** ""...已接受周全的安全及訓練指導.""
*   **C:** ""...受到國家公園管理員之緊密監督...""
*   **D:** ""...獲選進行第一場射擊的 4 位射擊手..."""
根據這段文字，裂谷是在哪裡發現的？,"The correct answer is **D: 在衣索比亞**.

The text states: ""衣索比亞「裂谷研究服務」的研究員...伯爾漢·阿斯法"". This directly indicates that the ""裂谷研究服務"" and implicitly the裂谷 are in Ethiopia.
"
根據這段文字，什麼事情發生的時間比預料的更早？,"正確答案是 **A: 化石的發現**

這段文字明確指出，根據化石的發現，演化分家的時間比分子證據所預料的要早得多。因此，化石的發現意味著演化分家的時間需要往前推，也就是比預料的更早發生。
"

"
新華社的最新報導中沒有說明什麼？,"正確答案是 **B: 飛機降落在烏魯木齊**

理由如下：

*   **A: 飛機收到炸彈威脅** - 後續報告有提到飛機受到炸彈威脅。
*   **B: 飛機降落在烏魯木齊** - 報告指出飛機**被拒絕**緊急降落在烏魯木齊，因此並沒有降落在那裡。
*   **C: 飛機遭轉回阿富汗** - 後續報告說明飛機改道返回阿富汗。
*   **D: 飛機降落在坎大哈** - 後續報告說明飛機降落在坎大哈。

題目問的是新華社的**最新報導** *沒有*說明什麼，而選項B是唯一一個新華社的最新報導 *有* 說明 *沒有* 降落的城市。
"
新華社最初的報導中沒有說明什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 飛機遭劫持 (The plane was hijacked)**.

The passage states:

*   ""稍早之前，中國新聞媒體新華社曾報導一架飛機被劫持 (Earlier, Chinese news agency Xinhua reported that a plane was hijacked).""
*   ""後續的報告說明該飛機接獲炸彈威脅，因而改道返回阿富汗，降落於坎大哈 (Subsequent reports indicated the plane received a bomb threat and was diverted back to Afghanistan, landing in Kandahar).""

This means Xinhua's initial report *did* mention the hijacking. The question asks what was *not* in the initial report.

The other options are mentioned only in subsequent reports:

*   **B: 飛機遭拒絕緊急降落 (The plane was refused an emergency landing):** This is mentioned as something in the *initial* reports about the plane returning to Afghanistan
*   **C: 飛機遭轉回阿富汗 (The plane was diverted back to Afghanistan):** This is in a *subsequent* report.
*   **D: 飛機收到炸彈威脅 (The plane received a bomb threat):** This is also in a *subsequent* report.

Therefore, A is incorrect, and the answer is A.
"
莎拉·戴紐斯在廣播節目中公布了什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 將不再嘗試聯繫巴布·迪倫**

The passage states: ""戴紐斯說：「現在我們什麼都不做...就現在來說，那樣的確就夠了。」"" This clearly indicates they are giving up trying to contact Bob Dylan.
"
戴紐斯無法聯繫到誰？,"The correct answer is **D: 巴布·迪倫** (Bob Dylan).

The passage states that the committee could not directly contact Bob Dylan to discuss his Nobel Prize.
"
是誰評論此一承諾是為「一大步」？,"The correct answer is **C: 戈登·喬翰羅 (Gordon Johndroe)**.

The passage states: ""布希發言人戈登·喬翰羅將朝鮮的承諾稱為「達成朝鮮半島可核實無核化目標的一大步。」"" which directly translates to ""Bush spokesperson Gordon Johndroe called North Korea's commitment 'a major step toward achieving verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.'""
"
斯拉尼亞為多國製作了多少枚郵票？,"The passage states: ""He produced more than a thousand stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries.""

"
根據這段文字，油槽排氣孔持續漏油的可能原因是什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 熱膨脹**.

The passage states: ""截至週三下午，油槽排氣孔仍在漏油，可能是油槽內部的熱膨脹所致。"" (As of Wednesday afternoon, oil was still leaking from the tank vent, likely due to thermal expansion inside the tank.) This directly links the leaking to thermal expansion.
"
為什麼放洩閥會打開？,"The correct answer is **B: 系統測試後發生斷電**.

The passage states: ""斷電之後，隨之而來的是常規的火災指揮系統測試，導致放洩閥開啟..."" This directly links the power outage and system test to the opening of the relief valve.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 油槽內部的熱膨脹**: 熱膨脹可能導致持續洩漏，但不是造成放洩閥初始開啟的原因。
*   **C: 油槽已全滿**: 文章說油槽溢出到輸送平台，但沒說油槽已經全滿。放洩閥開啟的原因是在系統測試後發生斷電，並非油槽已滿。
*   **D: 第二攔油區無法容納足夠的桶量**: 文章提到第二攔油區*沒有*滿。"
目前第九區的水位有多高？,"正確答案是 **C: 水深及腰**。

文本中明確指出，目前第九區的水深及腰。
"
卡崔娜颶風來襲期間，第九區發生了什麼事？,"The best answer is **C: 洪水高達 20 英尺**

The original text states: ""卡崔娜颶風來襲時曾水淹高達二十英尺的第九區..."" (When Hurricane Katrina hit, the Ninth District was flooded up to twenty feet...)

The other options are incorrect because they describe conditions after Katrina, not during.
"
漢密爾頓並未證實以下何者？,"The correct answer is **B: 其他患者感染病毒的可能性 (The possibility of other patients contracting the virus)**

Here's why:

*   The passage states Hamilton confirmed:
    *   The patient's travel history (Nigeria)
    *   The patient's stable condition
    *   The hospital followed infection control protocols.

*   The passage implies that other patients could potentially be infected, but Hamilton does not confirm whether other patients actually contracted the virus.
"
科學家想瞭解的事情是什麼？,"The best answer is **D: 地球是如何形成的**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""科學家希望瞭解星球形成的過程，尤其是地球...因為彗星在很久以前曾與地球相撞."" This directly links the interest in planet formation, specifically Earth's, to the fact that comets collided with it.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: 彗星何時與地球相撞 (When did comets collide with Earth)** While knowing the timing of the collisions is relevant, the primary goal is broader: understanding the *process* of Earth's formation. The timing is just one piece of that puzzle.
* **B: 蛋白質是如何形成的 (How are proteins formed)** The passage mentions organic material from comets could form proteins, but the focus is on Earth's formation, not protein formation itself. Protein formation is a consequence of the organic material.
* **C: 什麼是有機物質 (What is organic matter)** Again, understanding organic matter is relevant, but it's not the central research question. It's a contributing factor to understanding how Earth formed.

Therefore, **D** is the most encompassing and accurate answer.
"
根據這段文字，當地警方在關閉隧道中扮演了什麼角色？,"The correct answer is **C: 他們指揮駕駛者改道行駛** (They directed drivers to reroute).

The passage states: ""自卸卡車被用來堵住隧道的各個入口處，並在 80 名警力的協助下指揮駕駛們改道行駛。"" This translates to ""Dump trucks were used to block each entrance to the tunnel, and 80 police officers assisted in directing drivers to reroute.""
"
隧道入口在關閉期間發生了什麼事？,"The correct answer is **A: 它們被堵住了 (They were blocked)**.

The passage states, ""自卸卡車被用來堵住隧道的各個入口處 (Dump trucks were used to block each entrance to the tunnel)."" Therefore, the entrances were blocked.
"
根據這段文字，攝影師被車撞到前沒有發生什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **D: 攝影師得以拍到了小賈斯汀的照片**

The text says that Justin Bieber was not present at the scene. Therefore, the photographer would not have been able to take his picture. All of the other options are mentioned as actions the photographer took before being hit.
"
攝影師在被車撞到前試圖做什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 拍攝警察攔停點的照片 (Photograph police during a traffic stop)**.

The passage states: ""該名攝影師在塞普爾韋達大道 (Sepulveda Boulevard) 的對側停下車，試圖在穿過馬路並繼續前進之前對警察攔停點拍照... (The photographer stopped his car on the other side of Sepulveda Boulevard and tried to photograph a police traffic stop before crossing the road...)""
"
關於總理在確診病毒後的狀況，哪種說法不正確？,"The incorrect statement is **A: He feels unwell**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states he feels ""healthy and in good condition"" *aside* from the fever and sore throat. Feeling healthy is the opposite of feeling unwell.

The other options are true based on the text:

*   B: He has a sore throat (explicitly stated).
*   C: His condition is stable (explicitly stated about the president, which is how he describes himself).
*   D: He has a fever (explicitly stated)."
根據這段文字，以下關於總理的說法中，何者為真？,"The correct answer is **C: 他身體狀況良好，可以遠端辦公 (He is in good health and can work remotely)**

Here's why:

*   **A: 他沒有發燒 (He doesn't have a fever):** The text explicitly states he has a fever.
*   **B: 他將留在家裡幾個星期 (He will stay home for several weeks):** The text says he hopes to return to his duties on Monday, implying a much shorter isolation period.
*   **D: 他有病毒的嚴重症狀 (He has severe symptoms of the virus):** The text says he has *mild* symptoms.

Therefore, only option C accurately reflects the information given in the text."
根據這段文字，熱帶氣旋古努預計何時會持續減弱？,"The correct answer is **B: 當風速降至每小時約 83 公里時**.

The passage states the wind speed was *already* about 83 km/h *and* that it is expected to continue weakening. This means the weakening is happening *at* or *from* that point.
"
熱帶氣旋古努巔峰期的風速有多快？,"The correct answer is **C: 每小時 149 英里**

The passage states that the highest sustained wind speed reached 240 km/h (149 mph). The question asks about the *peak* wind speed.
"
以下何者並不被視為腰鞭毛藻的特徵？,"The correct answer is **C: 它是多細胞生物 (It is a multicellular organism)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that dinoflagellates (腰鞭毛藻) are ""single-celled"" (單細胞) marine microorganisms. Multicellular means ""many cells.""
*   The other options are all directly supported by the passage:
    *   A: It is an algae - The passage says ""這種藻類的數量急速增加"" (This algae's quantity increases rapidly).
    *   B: It can paralyze human nerves - The passage says ""這種藻類會產生神經毒素，癱瘓人類和魚類的神經"" (This algae produces neurotoxins, paralyzing the nerves of humans and fish).
    *   D: It is naturally occurring - The passage says ""腰鞭毛藻是一種天然生成的單細胞海洋微生物"" (Dinoflagellates are naturally occurring single-celled marine microorganisms)."
以下何者是腰鞭毛藻無法做到的事情？,"根據文章內容：

*   **A: 癱瘓魚類的神經** - 文章提到腰鞭毛藻產生的神經毒素會癱瘓人類和魚類的神經，所以A是腰鞭毛藻可以做到的。
*   **B: 處於任何條件皆能急速增加數量** - 文章說自然因素交互作用產生*理想的*環境，腰鞭毛藻的數量才會急速增加。這表示並非任何條件下都能大量繁殖。所以B是正確答案。
*   **C: 影響水質** - 紅潮的發生就是腰鞭毛藻影響水質的表現。
*   **D: 產生神經毒素** - 文章中明確指出腰鞭毛藻會產生神經毒素。

所以，腰鞭毛藻無法做到的是在任何條件下都能急速增加數量。

因此，答案是 **B**
"
根據這段文字，以下何者並非颶風費莉希亞所導致的？,"The passage states that there have been no reports of disasters or floods. Option D, ""街道洪水泛濫 (Street flooding),"" is a disaster/flood. Therefore, the answer is D.
"
關於颶風費莉希亞的哪種說法有誤？,"The correct answer is **B: 在變成第四級颶風前，它原本被歸類為熱帶低氣壓** (Before becoming a Category 4 hurricane, it was originally classified as a tropical depression).

Here's why:

*   The passage states Felicia *decreased* to a tropical depression before dissipating. It started as a Category 4 hurricane and weakened. Therefore, it couldn't have been a tropical depression *before* being a Category 4 hurricane.
The other options are factually supported by the given text."
哪一種說法正確表達了 2009 年匈牙利大獎賽後的結果？,"The correct answer is **C: 小畢奇賽後遭到解僱**. The passage states that after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix, Nelson Piquet Jr. lost his drive. This is equivalent to being fired or dismissed from his role as a race car driver.
"
撞車事故發生於何時？,"正確答案是 **C: 安全車出來之前**

題目明確指出小畢奇的撞車導致安全車出動。因此，撞車事故一定發生在安全車出動之前。

翻譯：

P: In the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, Nelson Piquet Jr. crashed shortly after Fernando Alonso's brief pit stop, resulting in the deployment of the safety car. Alonso moved to the front of the pack to take the victory as the cars ahead of him pitted for fuel under the safety car. Piquet Jr. lost his drive after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.
Q: When did the crash occur?
A: Right after Alonso pitted
B: When the other cars were refueling
C: Before the safety car came out
D: After Piquet Jr. went in for refueling
"
根據這段文字，以下哪一項花費的時間比研究人員最初認為的要少？,"The correct answer is **A: 物種的形成 (The formation of species)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""儘管過去人們認為新物種的演化過程歷時更久，但來自美國普林斯頓大學與瑞士烏普薩拉大學的研究人員卻發現這個新物種在短短兩個世代內就演化出來了...""
*   This directly indicates that the **formation of a new species** took less time than previously thought.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 關於物種的報告 (Report on species)**: The passage discusses the *formation* of a species, not the time it takes to write a report about it.
*   **C: 不同物種之間的繁殖 (Reproduction between different species)**: While hybridization is mentioned, the passage doesn't focus on the *time* it takes for reproduction between different species.
*   **D: 物種的演化 (Evolution of species)**: This is very close to the correct answer. But the passage specifically states that it is the **formation of *new* species** that happens faster than they thought. Thus, *the formation* is more specifically what took less time."
研究人員沒有報導以下哪一項？,"The correct answer is **C: 新物種的名稱**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 新物種形成的地方 (新物種形成的地方)**: The passage states the new species is forming in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
*   **B: 演化歷時長短 (演化歷時長短)**: The passage mentions the evolution happened in ""短短兩個世代內"" (in just two generations).
*   **D: 涉及混種的鳥類 (涉及混種的鳥類)**: The passage names the bird species involved in the hybridization: ""達爾文雀（Geospiza fortes）和外來的仙人掌雀（Geospiza conirostris）"" (Geospiza fortis and the immigrant Geospiza conirostris).
*   **C: 新物種的名稱 (新物種的名稱)**: The passage doesn't mention the name of the new species that is forming.

Therefore, the researchers did not report the name of the new species."
奔牛藝術節將在哪裡舉行？,"The correct answer is **B: 在布加勒斯特市**

The passage states that ""該城市[布加勒斯特]將成為東南歐首座主辦奔牛藝術節城市。"" (The city [Bucharest] will be the first city in Southeast Europe to host the CowParade.)
"
關於奔牛藝術節的描述，以下說法何者正確？,"The correct answer is **D: 這是世界上最大的公共藝術活動 (This is the largest public art event in the world)**.

The passage states: ""奔牛藝術節是世界上最盛大的公共藝術活動..."" which translates to ""The CowParade is the largest public art event in the world...""
"
是什麼原因導致俄羅斯停飛伊爾-76 ？,"正確答案是 **B: 一起事故**

這段文字明確指出，因為一架伊爾-76 飛機在起飛時發生引擎脫落的事故，俄羅斯短暫停飛了伊爾-76。
"
什麼是伊爾-76？,"The correct answer is **C: 一架飛機**.

The passage states ""伊爾-76 自 1970 年代起即為俄羅斯及蘇聯軍事重要的一部分，上個月已經在俄羅斯發生一起重大事故"" which clearly indicates that Il-76 is an aircraft.
"
誰聘請了《辛普森家庭》的編劇團隊？,"The correct answer is **B: Simon**.

The passage states, ""In 1989, he collaborated with Brooks and Groening to develop The Simpsons, and he was responsible for hiring the show's initial team of writers."" This clearly indicates that Simon hired the writing team.
"
根據弗路克所言，是誰給了她正向的留言與鼓勵？,"正確答案是 **D: 男性和女性皆有**

題目引述弗路克的話：「她之所以得到這個結論，是因為收到了許多來自女性和男性的正向留言與鼓勵...」
"
根據這段文字，為什麼有人不想讓女性公開發表意見？,"從這段文字中，我們可以推斷出**C: 婦女健康** 是答案。

弗路克的結論是，壓制女性疾呼婦女健康的行為是不會成功的。這暗示有人試圖阻止女性公開表達關於婦女健康的意見。 其他選項則無關。
"
根據這段文字，哪個天體最有活力？,"The correct answer is **A: 地球**.

The passage states, ""据我们所知，只有一个天体比泰坦星更有活力，它就叫地球"" which translates to ""As far as we know, only one celestial body is more dynamic than Titan, and it is called Earth.""
"
在哪個天體上發現了由透明液體組成的河流和湖泊？,"正確答案是 **B: 泰坦星**

引文直接提到 ""只有一個天體比泰坦星更有活力..."".  引文也提到 ""它的特性就跟水一樣。透明如水。"" 以及在岸邊可以看到底部的東西，這些都在描述泰坦星上的液體。
"
在這些發現中，何者並非發現羽毛的結果？,"The correct answer is **D: 確認大多數恐龍都有羽毛**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the discovery *proves* a widespread theory that *at least some* dinosaurs had feathers. It doesn't confirm that *most* dinosaurs had feathers.
*   The passage explicitly mentions the colors of the feathers (A), states that the feather structure indicates they were not used for flight (B), and discusses the evolution of feathers, providing insights into that process (C)."
恐龍的羽毛不具備什麼？,"正確答案是 **B: 羽軸**。

段落中明確指出：「因為恐龍的羽毛缺乏發展健全的軸，所謂羽軸...」所以恐龍的羽毛不具備羽軸。
"
以下關於 ZMapp 的敘述中，何者為非？,"正確答案是 **B: 它能夠治療既有感染，但不能預防死亡**

原因如下：

*   文章明確指出「正式研究指出，它的效果並未達到預防死亡的預期目標」，這並不代表它「能夠治療既有感染」。事實上，文章只是說它無法有效預防死亡，並沒有肯定它能治療感染。選項B錯誤地詮釋了文章的內容。
*   其他選項都可以在文章中找到直接支持：
    *   A: 「一種抗體雞尾酒 ZMapp」 指出它由抗體製成。
    *   C: 「ZMapp 在 PALM 試驗中作為對照組」 文章中明確提到。
    *   D: 「起初很可望在實務上帶來好消息，但正式研究指出，它的效果並未達到預防死亡的預期目標」說明了它的效果比預期的要少。"
關於 PALM 試驗的描述，以下說法何者正確？,"The correct answer is **C: ZMapp 被用作為試驗基準 (ZMapp was used as the baseline for the trial)**.

The passage states: ""ZMapp 在 PALM 試驗中作為對照組，代表科學家將其視為基準，與其他三種治療方法相比較 (ZMapp was used as a control group in the PALM trial, representing the baseline against which the other three treatments were compared)."" This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 研究表明，它的效果可能比預期的要好 (Research indicates its effect may be better than expected)** The passage explicitly says ZMapp's effectiveness ""並未達到預防死亡的預期目標 (did not achieve the expected goal of preventing death).""
*   **B: 將管制藥品與其他三種治療方法進行了對照，其中一種是 ZMapp (Controlled substances were compared with three other treatments, one of which was ZMapp)** This doesn't accurately describe the PALM trial. It's about comparing different *treatments* (not necessarily controlled substances) against the ZMapp baseline.
*   **D: 試驗證明它可有效治療現有病況 (The trial proved it to be effective in treating existing conditions)** The passage clearly states that ZMapp didn't meet expectations for preventing death, so it wasn't proven effective."
研究人員認為新芯片對哪裡的意義最大？,"The correct answer is **A: 低收入國家**.

The passage explicitly states the potential for early disease detection in low-income countries with the new chip, and highlights the disparity in survival rates for diseases like breast cancer between low-income and wealthier nations.
"
診斷工具將會透過何種方式製作？,"The correct answer is **B: 標準噴墨印表機**.

The passage states the chips ""can be printed using a standard inkjet printer.""
"
根據這段文字，關於瓣狀陡坡的說法，何者為非？,"The correct answer is **D: 在月球表面發現的陡坡並不多 (Steep slopes are not found in large numbers on the moon's surface)**.

Here's why:

* **A: 創造陡坡的事件可能最近才發生 (The events that created the steep slopes may have occurred recently)** This is supported by the text. The text states that the low weathering of the scarps suggests recent geological activity.
* **B: 它們的存在表示月球並不缺乏地質活動 (Their existence indicates that the moon does not lack geological activity)** This is also supported by the text. The discovery of the scarps challenges the idea of a geologically inactive moon.
* **C: 它們可能是月球縮小所導致的結果 (They may be the result of the moon shrinking)** This is directly stated in the text.
* **D: 在月球表面發現的陡坡並不多 (Steep slopes are not found in large numbers on the moon's surface)** The text says: ""月球上到處都是這種陡坡 (These steep slopes are everywhere on the moon),"" so this statement is false.

Therefore, option D is the only statement that contradicts the information presented in the text.
"
根據這段文字，關於地形的何種理論表明月球上發生了地質活動？,"The correct answer is **D: 這些地形是最近才形成的**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the ""瓣狀陡坡"" (lobate scarps) are evidence of the moon slowly shrinking.
* It also says that the scarps' low weathering indicates they formed ""不久之前"" (not long ago).
* The overall point is that these *recent* geological events contradict the idea that the moon is geologically dead.

Therefore, the theory that these scarps are recently formed supports the idea of recent geological activity on the moon. Options A, B, and C do not directly support recent geological activity as described in the passage.
"
根據這段文字，起訴之前將不會再有什麼？,"The answer is **A: 進一步的評論 (Further comments)**.

The text states: ""負責整體檢察事宜的蘇格蘭皇家檢察院向記者表示，至少在起訴前，將不再做出任何評論。"" This directly translates to the fact that no further comments will be made before the prosecution.
"
根據這段文字，何者並非海豹目前的問題？,"The correct answer is **D: 融冰**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 極端的天氣條件 (Extreme weather conditions):** The passage explicitly states that extreme weather conditions are hindering rescue efforts.
*   **B: 冰的量 (Amount of ice):** The passage says the amount of ice is the worst seen in 15 years.
*   **C: 冰的厚度 (Thickness of ice):** The passage mentions the thickness of the ice is the worst seen in 15 years.
*   **D: 融冰 (Melting ice):** The passage talks about ice breaking, which could be interpreted as melting. However, the main problem is the **amount and thickness** of the ice, which is hindering the seal hunters. The problem is too much ice, not melting.

Therefore, melting ice is not presented as a current problem for the seals, but instead, the abundant amount and thickness of the ice is the problem."
除了冰，還有什麼因素影響救援工作？,"The correct answer is **B: 天氣狀況**.

The passage explicitly states that extreme weather conditions hinder rescue efforts. The other options are not mentioned in the given text.
"
羅伯茲迴避驗證哪個信念？,"The correct answer is **C: 生命起始點**.

The passage explicitly states that Roberts ""refused to say what he believed regarding the point at which life begins."" The other options are things he *did* address.
"
羅伯茲覺得哪個話題太不道德而無法討論？,"The correct answer is **D: 特定可能的具體情況**.

The passage states that Roberts refused to say when he believes life begins and said that commenting on ""特定可能的具體情況 (specific possible circumstances)"" would be immoral.
"
兩道光束照向何處？,"The correct answer is **A: 照向天際** (照向天際 means ""towards the sky"").

The passage states ""兩道光束直直照向天際"", which translates to ""Two beams of light shone straight towards the sky."" The other options are not mentioned as targets of the light beams.
"
根據這段文字，該地點於何時建造新的摩天大樓？,"The correct answer is **D: 正在興建中** (currently under construction).

The text states: ""目前正在原址興建五座新的摩天大樓..."" which translates to ""Five new skyscrapers are currently being built on the site...""
"
哪些資訊表明七姐妹是洞穴？,"The best answer is **A: 溫差**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""紅外線影像顯示其日夜溫差，顯現這些地方可能是洞穴。 「它們在白天比附近的平面更冷，夜晚則比附近的平面熱..."" This directly links temperature differences to the possibility of these features being caves.

Here's why the other options are less direct:

*   **B: 洞穴入口的直徑:** While the size is mentioned, it's not the primary evidence *indicating* they are caves. Large size alone doesn't guarantee a cave.
*   **C: 地理調查:** The USGS involvement lends credibility, but the *specific* finding that supports the cave theory is the temperature variation identified through infrared imagery.
*   **D: 地球上洞穴的影像:** Comparison to Earth caves provides context but is not direct evidence that the 7 Sisters are caves.

Therefore, the temperature difference is the most direct piece of information mentioned in the passage suggesting the ""Seven Sisters"" are caves."
如何觀察七姐妹的熱行為？,"The correct answer is **A: 紅外線影像**.

The passage explicitly states that ""紅外線影像 (infrared imagery) 顯示其日夜溫差 (showed their day and night temperature differences), 顯現這些地方可能是洞穴 (revealing that these locations were possibly caves)."" The thermal behavior of the Seven Sisters was observed using infrared imagery.
"
根據這段文字，關於嫌犯的哪一種說法為非？,"正確答案是 **D: 他並未受傷**。

段落指出嫌犯在爆炸中受傷，因此說他沒有受傷是錯誤的。 其他選項都與段落中的資訊相符。
"
有關這次攻擊，當局確認了哪些資訊？,"The correct answer is **B: 嫌犯的種族**.

The passage states: ""有關當局還不知道他的名字，但他們知道他是維吾爾族的一份子."" This confirms that authorities have identified the suspect's ethnicity. The passage doesn't mention anything about identifying any accomplices or the motive of the attack. The suspect's full name is also not confirmed in the passage.
"
哪些球隊將在艾利斯公園參賽？,"The correct answer is **C: 南非和澳洲**.

The passage states: ""該系列賽的最後一場比賽將於下週，當南非國家橄欖球隊在澳洲比賽時，在約翰尼斯堡的艾利斯公園球場舉行."" This clearly indicates that South Africa (南非) and Australia (澳洲) will be playing at Ellis Park.
"
Springboks 隊的下一場比賽將在哪裡進行？,"The correct answer is **C: 約翰尼斯堡**.

The passage states: ""該系列賽的最後一場比賽將於下週，當南非國家橄欖球隊在澳洲比賽時，在約翰尼斯堡的艾利斯公園球場舉行.""
"
在執行任務期間，太空站遇到了以下哪項問題？,"The correct answer is **A: 與推進器維持適當距離**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""據報導，焦立中和沙里波夫與姿態調整推進器保持安全距離."" (It was reported that Jiao Lizhong and Sharipov maintained a safe distance from the attitude control thrusters.) This directly indicates a concern or problem related to the distance from the thrusters.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: 保留陀螺儀 (Retaining gyroscopes):** The passage explicitly states that the station ""損失了陀螺儀 (lost a gyroscope).""
*   **C: 噴射口啟動 (Thruster activation):** The thrusters were *activated* to solve the problem, not the problem itself.
*   **D: 恢復正常姿態 (Restoring normal attitude):** Restoring attitude was the solution to the problem, not the problem itself."
根據這段文字，太空站的任務目標是什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 完成太空漫步**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""雖然該站在先前的太空站任務中損失陀螺儀，但還是維持了其姿態直到太空漫步結束。"" This means the太空漫步 was in progress and the station maintained its attitude until it was done.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 找到遺失的陀螺儀:** The passage mentions a lost gyroscope but doesn't state the aim of the mission was to find it.
*   **B: 靠近調整推進器:** The passage says the astronauts kept a *safe distance* from the thrusters, so approaching them was not the goal.
*   **D: 啟動噴射口:** While the ground control *did* activate the jets, this was to *correct* the station's attitude *after* the spacewalk. It wasn't the main goal of the mission itself."
關於本案的陳述中，以下何者為非？,"正確答案是 **D: AOL 遭到起訴**

陳述中明確指出 AOL 是提告者，也就是被害人，而不是被起訴的對象。其他選項 A、B 和 C 都是陳述中所表明的事實。
"
關於本案的描述，以下說法何者正確？,"The correct answer is **D: 本案由 AOL 提起訴訟 (This case was brought by AOL)**.

The passage states that AOL is the plaintiff (提告者), meaning they are the ones who filed the lawsuit.
"
根據這段文字，維達爾三個賽季前開始在哪家俱樂部效力？,"The correct answer is **A: 塞維利亞**

The passage states ""28 歲的維達爾三個賽季前從塞維利亞足球俱樂部加入巴塞隆納足球俱樂部"". This directly indicates that Vidal joined Barcelona from Sevilla.
"
維達爾為巴塞隆納俱樂部踢了多少場比賽？,"The correct answer is **A: 49 場** because the passage states ""自從搬到加泰隆尼亞的首府後，比達爾已經為球隊踢了 49 場球賽"".

The passage explicitly states: ""他在預定週日與 Bolonia 的對戰之前，都待在球隊住宿的飯店中 (He stayed at the team's hotel before the scheduled Sunday match against Bolonia)."" This indicates that he was staying at the hotel because of the upcoming game.
"
為什麼雅加達地球物理局不發布警報？,"The correct answer is **D: 震規未達門檻 (The quake didn't reach the threshold)**.

The passage explicitly states that the earthquake didn't reach the 6.5 magnitude threshold required for issuing a tsunami warning according to the Jakarta Geophysical Agency.  Therefore, that's the reason they didn't issue a warning.
"
根據這段文字，地震造成什麼結果？,"The correct answer is **A: 當地人的恐慌**.

The passage explicitly states that despite no tsunami threat, residents panicked. The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: 海嘯威脅:** The passage states there was *no* tsunami threat.
*   **C: 發布警報:** The passage states that no tsunami alert was issued.
*   **D: 6.5 級震規:** The passage states the quake didn't reach the magnitude 6.5 threshold to issue a tsunami alert."
下列何者推動了太陽和所有其他恆星的活動？,"從P段文字中可以得知：

*   恆星的活動受**光度**、**自轉**推動。
*   羅士比數跟**電漿的流動**有關，必須以**光度**和**自轉**來判斷。

因此，**自轉和光度**直接推動恆星活動，而電漿流動與羅士比數相關，羅士比數又與光度和自轉相關。

正確答案是 **C: 自轉和光度**
"
如何判斷恆星的羅士比數？,"The correct answer is **A: 光度和自轉**.

The passage explicitly states: ""恆星的羅士比數跟電漿的流動有關，必須以光度和自轉來判斷。"" (The Rossby number of a star is related to the flow of plasma and must be judged by its luminosity and rotation.)
"
有多少百分比的受訪者支持澳洲立即成為共和國？,"The correct answer is **B: 29%**.

The text states: ""In the poll's two extremes, 29% of respondents thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible...""

關於埃胡德·烏爾醫師所做的研究何者為真？,"The correct answer is **B: 部分曾經罹患糖尿病老鼠現在沒有糖尿病**

Let's break down why:

*   **A: 結果可能對已患有第一型糖尿病患者有益** - Dr. Ur explicitly states the findings are *not* relevant to people with type 1 diabetes.
*   **C: 他樂觀地認為這些發現可找到治癒方法** - Dr. Ur expresses skepticism about a cure for diabetes.
*   **D: 部分不曾罹患糖尿病的的老鼠現在患有糖尿病** - The passage does not mention about healthy mice getting diabetes.
*   **B: 部分曾經罹患糖尿病老鼠現在沒有糖尿病** - The first sentence of the passage states: ""We have 4-month-old mice that had diabetes and now don't,"" and Dr. Ur is commenting on this study."
根據這段文字，烏爾醫師對什麼存疑？,"The correct answer is **B: 是否可以治癒**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states: ""如同其他專家，他對糖尿病是否可以治癒存疑..."" This means Dr. Ur has doubts about the possibility of curing diabetes.

While Dr. Ur does also comment on the relevance of the study to type 1 diabetes, the primary doubt expressed in the text is about the general concept of a diabetes cure.

關於 CG4684 航班墜機事件的描述，以下說法何者不正確？,"The incorrect statement is **C: 飛機在墜毀前已嘗試降落三次 (The plane had attempted to land three times before crashing)**.

The passage states the plane attempted to land *once* and then disappeared on the second attempt.

Therefore, the answer is **C**.
"
是什麼導致 CG4684 班機降落失敗？,"The correct answer is **D: 天氣條件很惡劣**.

The passage states that the search was hampered by the same bad weather that caused the initial landing attempt to fail. This directly implies that bad weather was a factor in the failed landing attempt.
"
根據這段文字，關於弗朗西斯克·科瓦爾經歷的敘述中，以下何者正確？,"The correct answer is **B: He eventually emerged unscathed.**

The passage states: ""I was fortunate enough to escape unscathed..."" which directly translates to him not being harmed.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: He managed to break a window:** The passage says ""One of the panes of glass finally broke,"" but it doesn't specify that Kowal was the one who broke it.
*   **C: He broke a chair trying to get out:** The passage says people were using chairs, but doesn't specify if Kowal did.
*   **D: He was injured trying to break a window:** The passage explicitly states he escaped ""unscathed.""
"
為什麼很難說得準熱帶風暴丹妮爾可能產生的影響？,"The correct answer is **C: 風暴還要很久才會登陸**.

The passage states: ""預計暴風雨還要很久才會登陸，會對美國或加勒比海地區造成多大的影響還很難說。"" (It is too early to tell how much of an impact the storm will have on the United States or the Caribbean because the storm will take a long time to make landfall.) This directly explains why it's hard to predict the impact.
"
根據這段文字，以下關於熱帶風暴丹妮爾的說法中，何者為非？,"The correct answer is **D: It is about to make landfall.**

The text states: ""It is too early to tell how much of an impact the storm could have on the United States or the Caribbean, and that it will be a while before it makes landfall."" This directly contradicts option D.
"
根據這段文字，在引起全球大流行之前，疾病必須先發生什麼事？,"The correct answer is **A: 必須變得不那麼致命 (Must become less lethal)**.

The text explicitly states: ""他指出，部分研究認為這種疾病必須先變得較不致命，才有可能造成全球大流行 (He pointed out that some studies believe that the disease must first become less deadly in order to cause a global pandemic).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 症狀必須保持輕微 (Symptoms must remain mild)**: While the text mentions mild symptoms and concern about transmission, it doesn't state this as a *prerequisite* for a pandemic, but rather a concerning aspect of the current situation.
*   **C: 必須傳染給更多的人 (Must infect more people)**: This is likely a *consequence* of the disease becoming less lethal and people continuing their daily routines while mildly ill, but not the *cause* of the pandemic.
*   **D: 兒童必須出現症狀 (Children must develop symptoms)**: The text mentions children with asymptomatic infections, but this isn't presented as a condition necessary for a pandemic."
根據這段文字，當時颱風離福建有多遠？,"The correct answer is **C: 70 公里**.

The text explicitly states that the typhoon's eye was approximately 70 kilometers from Fujian province.
"
喬治·W·布希抵達亞洲時，是誰迎接他？,"The best answer is **D: 副總理** (Deputy Prime Minister).

While the text mentions Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, it specifically states that Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng greeted Bush upon arrival. Option C is partially correct, but not the most precise.
"
總統何時談到亞洲擴大貿易一事？,"The correct answer is **C: 於中期選舉失利後 (Yu zhongqi xuanju shili hou)**.

The passage states that ""期中選舉失利的一週後，布希告訴聽眾將於亞洲擴大貿易一事 (Qizhong xuanju shili de yi zhou hou, Bushi gaosu tingzhong jiang yu Yizhou kuoda maoyi yi shi),"" which translates to ""A week after the midterm election loss, Bush told the audience about expanding trade in Asia."" Therefore, he talked about expanding trade in Asia *after* the midterm election loss.
"
根據這段文字，總的來說，以下何者是政府的目標？,"The correct answer is **D: 紓解人潮過度擁擠的車廂**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the addition of 300 cars (bringing the total to 1,300) is intended ""to紓解擁擠人潮"" (to relieve crowded conditions).
*   A and B are actions taken to achieve the goal, but not the goal itself.
*   C is not a direct goal but the total number of cars after the increase.

Therefore, the overall goal is to alleviate overcrowding."
政府公告了什麼事項？,"The best answer is **A: 他們計劃撥款購買額外 300 台的車輛**.

Here's why:

* **A** directly states the immediate action being announced: the plan to purchase 300 more cars.
* **B** is true, but it's the *reason* behind the action, not the announcement itself.
* **C** is incorrect because the 1300 car number represents the total after the purchase, not the number of new cars being purchased.
* **D** is incorrect; the announcement builds upon a commitment made in March, but doesn't guarantee the problem will be solved then.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate and direct answer to the question.
"
根據這段文字，我們知道了什麼資訊？,"The correct answer is **A: 威脅程度已降低**.

Here's why:

*   **P: 她說：「無情報指出會發生立即性的攻擊。 然而，威脅程度降低至『嚴重』並不代表整體的威脅消失了。」**

This statement explicitly says the threat level has been reduced to ""serious."" It also clarifies that this reduction doesn't mean the threat is gone entirely.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 不再有任何威脅 (There is no longer any threat):** The text explicitly states that the threat has not disappeared entirely.
*   **C: 預計會發生攻擊 (An attack is expected to happen):** The text says there is no intelligence suggesting an immediate attack, which contradicts this option.
*   **D: 情報證實會發生很嚴重的攻擊 (Intelligence confirms that a very serious attack will occur):** This option is also incorrect because the text states there's no intelligence indicating an *immediate* attack, let alone a confirmed ""very serious"" one.

Therefore, only option A accurately reflects the information given in the text."
關於抗議活動，哪種說法為非？,"The correct answer is **A: 總統委員會是為回應抗議活動所設**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""總統委員會在上個月建議前任臨時選舉委員會辭職"". It doesn't say that the Presidential Council was created *in response* to the protests. Instead, it was part of a set of measures to move the country towards new elections, and their recommendation to the CEP was *part* of that set of actions.
*   The other options are explicitly supported by the text:
    *   B: 逾期選舉引發了抗議活動 - ""These...protests, were sparked by the failure to hold elections""
    *   C: 抗議活動要求前任臨時選舉委員會辭職 - The Presidential Council advised the previous CEP to resign
    *   D: 抗議活動有時會使用暴力 - ""These sometimes violent protests..."""
誰建議前任臨時選舉委員會辭職？,"The correct answer is **C: 總統委員會**.

The passage states: ""As part of a package of measures to move the country toward new elections, the Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP last month.""
"
根據聲明，在納薩爾虐待運動員之後，美國體操協會不支持什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **A: 取消資格 (Cancellation)**.

The passage states: ""美國體操協會同意美國奧委會的聲明，也就是我們的選手、團隊和其運動項目的利益，會因為我們組織內具有意義的改革而改善，而非取消資格 (USA Gymnastics agrees with the USOC that the interests of our athletes, teams, and the sport are best served by meaningful reform within our organization rather than disqualification.)"" This clearly indicates that USA Gymnastics does *not* support disqualification as a solution.

The other options are explicitly supported by the statement:

*   **B: 建立擁有自主權的環境 (Establishing an environment of autonomy)**: The passage says they want athletes to pursue their dreams in a ""safe, positive, and empowering environment"".
*   **C: 組織內的必要調整 (Necessary adjustments within the organization)**: The passage mentions introducing ""any necessary and appropriate adjustments"".
*   **D: 獨立調查 (Independent investigation)**: The passage explicitly supports an independent investigation.
"
根據聲明，美國體操協會和美國奧委會改善的主要目標是什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 為運動員推動安全的環境** (Promote a safe environment for athletes).

The passage explicitly states that both USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic Committee agree on the need to ""promote safe environments for all of our athletes"" and want to make gymnastics and other sports ""as safe as possible, allowing athletes to pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 揭露賴瑞·納薩爾的虐待行為 (Expose Larry Nassar's abuse)**: While the Nassar case is mentioned as the impetus for change, the primary goal is *preventing future abuse* by creating a safe environment. The statement is about moving forward, not just uncovering the past.
*   **B: 實行取消資格 (Implement disqualification)**: The statement explicitly says that the interests of athletes are better served by reform than by disqualification.
*   **C: 實行私人調查 (Implement a private investigation)**: The statement supports an independent investigation, not necessarily a private one. More importantly, the investigation is a means to an end (creating a safe environment), not the primary goal itself."
事件發生時，船要前往哪裡？ ,"The correct answer is **C: 巴拉望 (Palawan)**.

The passage states: ""該艦是復仇者級的反水雷艦，當時正前往巴拉望的普林塞薩港 (The ship was an Avenger-class mine countermeasures ship, and was heading to Puerto Princesa in Palawan).""
"
關於文中提及的船，何者為非？,"The answer is **B: 它位於巴拉望**.

While the ship was *heading to* Puerto Princesa in Palawan, the text implies the incident is happening *before* it arrives. The statement mentions the ship was ""heading to Puerto Princesa, Palawan"", but does not indicate it actually made it there. The phrase ""All crew are working to safely recover the ship"" strongly suggests the ship is stuck or stranded *somewhere else* along the way.

The other options are explicitly stated as true in the text.
"
是誰發表了關於美國軍隊的聲明？,"正確答案是 **A: 唐納·川普**

雖然新聞秘書發表了聲明，但聲明是美國總統唐納·川普宣布的。 因此，答案是 A.
"
根據聲明，哪個國家承擔了保護受俘戰士的責任？,"The correct answer is **D: 土耳其**.

The passage states that ""土耳其也將負責看守遭囚禁的伊斯蘭國 (ISIS) 成員"" which translates to ""Turkey will also be responsible for watching over the imprisoned Islamic State (ISIS) members.""
"
據信墜機的原因為何？,"The best answer is **B: 敵軍開火**.

The passage states: ""This crash occurred in a mountainous region and is believed to be due to enemy fire."" While the terrain and weather are factors hindering the search, the *believed cause* of the crash is enemy fire.
"
墜機發生在何種類型的地形中？,"The correct answer is **D: 多山的**

The passage states, ""這場墜機事件發生在高山區..."" which translates to ""The crash occurred in a mountainous region...""
"
政府希望洪水帶來什麼？,"正確答案是 **A: 恢復沙洲**。

P 段文字明確說明政府希望洪水足以「恢復下游被侵蝕的沙洲」。
"
大壩的建設對以下何者產生永久的影響？,"基於文章內容，最直接且永久受大壩建設影響的是**沙洲**和**沉積物擴散**。

*   **沙洲：** 文章明確指出大壩攔截了形成河口沙洲和海灘的沉積物，而政府正試圖恢復被侵蝕的沙洲。
*   **沉積物擴散：** 大壩建成後，抑制了將沉積物帶往整片河川的季節性洪水，因此沉積物擴散模式發生了永久性的改變。

雖然野生動物棲息地也受到影響（導致魚類滅絕），但其影響是間接的。野生動物棲息地之所以受到影響，是因為沉積物減少導致沙洲和海灘消失或改變。

座頭鯨則未在文章中被提及，所以是錯誤的答案。

因此，正確答案為 **A: 沙洲** 和 **D: 沉積物擴散**。 由於只能選擇一個答案，那麼**A: 沙洲** 似乎是更好的答案，因為它更直接地與沉積物的缺乏有關。"
根據這段文字，是誰向美國提供了有關可能會發生攻擊的情報？,"The correct answer is **C: 保密的消息來源**.

The text states that the US received *anonymous* information. This means the source is being kept secret, making ""保密的消息來源"" (confidential source) the most accurate answer. The other options are contradicted by the text.
"
關於極端主義者聲稱的攻擊計劃，以下說法何者正確？,"The correct answer is **C: 在兩個國家的地標引爆炸彈 (In the landmarks of two countries)**.

The warning specifically mentions ""著名的地標 (famous landmarks)"" in both Ethiopia and Kenya as targets for suicide bombings.
"
以下誰不是律師？,"正確答案是 **D: 麥基斯**。

理由如下：

*   **薩基斯凱亥尤基由 (Sakis Kechagioglou)** 和 **熱格尼科拉克波琉斯 (George Nikolakopoulos)** 被明確指出是律師。
*   **貝佐斯 (Petros Mantouvalos)** 被描述為國會議員暨律師。
*   **麥基斯 (Makis Triantafylopoulos)** 被描述為記者。"
希臘法律界醜聞當中並未提及哪一群人？,"The correct answer is **C: 記者**.

The passage mentions:

*   **法官 (Judges):** 首席法官依凡傑洛斯・克勞西斯因涉嫌貪瀆及墮落行為而鋃鐺入獄。
*   **律師 (Lawyers):** 薩基斯凱亥尤基由和熱格尼科拉克波琉斯被判有罪。國會議員暨律師貝佐斯因辦公室成員曾涉及非法賄賂和貪腐而下台。
*   **檢察官 (Prosecutors):** 過去幾年來從事過的非法行為也跟著曝光.
*   **事務律師 (Notaries):** 過去幾年來從事過的非法行為也跟著曝光.

The passage mentions a journalist (麥基斯) revealing information but does not implicate journalists as a group in the corruption."
印度失去了幾個三柱門？,"The correct answer is **A: 11 個**

The passage states that after losing the captain's wicket (which is one wicket), India lost 7 more wickets, resulting in a total of 1 + 7 = 8 wickets. However, the question asks about the *total* number of wickets lost in the entire innings, including the captain's. We need to infer the number of wickets lost *before* the captain's wicket. The passage says nothing about any wickets lost before that.

**Let's consider how many wickets are in a game of cricket to decide between 7 and 11.**

In cricket, an innings ends when 10 wickets are down. So if India lost 7 wickets after losing their captain's wicket, and they lost their captain's wicket, that means they lost a total of 8 wickets. Because an inning ends with only 10 wickets and the passage does not indicate more than one inning, then **A: 11 個 is incorrect**.

There's a misleading trick in the wording. The passage only refers to the *last* 7 wickets lost *after* losing the captain. We need to add the captain's wicket to that, which will equal the number of wickets lost *after* Sachin and Rahul scored 100 runs together. But what about before? The passage doesn't clarify how many wickets were lost *before* Sachin and Rahul scored 100 runs. 

We can infer that if *after* the first wicket lost, 7 wickets were lost that is a total of 8.
The passage states clearly ""...India lost 36 runs and **lost 7 wickets**, the innings ended."" Thus, the number of wickets lost at the **end of the inning** after the captain's wicket falls and after the 100 runs is seven.

There is only one correct answer to the question which is **B: 7 個**
"
根據這段文字，這一局的最高得分是多少？,"The correct answer is **A: 70 分 (70 points)**.

The passage states: ""羅賓·烏特帕創下球局最高分，僅以 41 球便完成 70 次跑位 (Robin Uthappa scored the highest score of the innings, scoring 70 runs off just 41 balls...)""
"
以下何者非亞當·庫爾登不滿的原因？,"根據引文，亞當·庫爾登的不滿包括：

*   威爾斯對作品遭刪除的原因撒謊 (假裝是法律考量)
*   威爾斯未真心傾聽

引文也提到，威爾斯的作品被刪除是爭議的一部分。

然而，引文提到該網站**正在**起草一項關於性內容的政策，這表示該政策在當時還不存在，因此不可能是庫爾登不滿的原因。

因此，正確答案是：

**A: 該網站關於性內容的新政策**
"
根據這段文字，什麼東西從網站上被刪除了？,"The correct answer is **A: 作品**.

The passage states that Adam Cuerden said, ""until **his works** were deleted."" This directly indicates that ""works"" were removed from the website. While the passage also discusses sexual content and a policy draft, those are related to the reason *why* the works were removed, not the actual items that were deleted.
"
根據這段文字，阿米爾·汗不支持以下何者？,"The correct answer is **A: 包括奧運會中的女鬥士**.

The passage states that Aamir Khan believes women shouldn't participate in fighting. Although he supports the British participants in the Olympics, it doesn't mean that he supports the female fighters."
根據這段文字，儘管與阿米爾·汗個人想法相左，他仍會支持以下何者？,"The correct answer is **A: 女鬥士 (Female fighters)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that despite his personal belief that women shouldn't be involved in fighting, he would support the British female competitors in the 2012 London Olympics. Female fighters are the subjects he would support despite his personal feelings.
* Options B, C, and D are incorrect because his support is specifically tied to female fighters participating in the 2012 Olympics, despite his personal beliefs."
彼得·倫茨何時死亡？,"The correct answer is **C: 在醫院 (In the hospital)**.

The text states he was taken to the hospital and later died there.
"
賽維爾·扎亞特是誰？,"The correct answer is **B: 另一位選手**.

The passage states that Peter Lenz was hit by ""fellow racer Savvy Zayat"". ""Fellow racer"" means another competitor in the race.
"
在什麼情況下，瞭解飛機的內部運作可能能夠幫助到焦慮的飛機旅客？,"正確答案是 **B: 如果他們對飛行的厭惡集中於對未知的恐懼上**

原因解釋：

* **P 的論點重點：** 瞭解飛機運作原理能幫助克服「基於未知或不可控因素的恐懼」。
* **B 選項：** 直接呼應 P 的論點，說明當恐懼來自於對飛機運作方式的無知時，瞭解內部運作原理是有幫助的。
* **A 選項：** 丟臉感與瞭解飛機運作原理沒有直接關聯。
* **C 選項：** 對所有交通方式的敵意，代表可能存在更深層次的心理因素，單純瞭解飛機運作原理可能無法解決問題。
* **D 選項：** 如果焦慮源於與飛行無關的創傷，瞭解飛機運作原理對解決創傷相關的焦慮沒有直接幫助。

因此，選項 B 最能呼應 P 的論點，說明瞭解飛機內部運作的原理在何種情況下能幫助焦慮的飛機旅客。
"
根據這段文字，一個注重價格的旅客最後會做以下哪件事？,"The correct answer is **D: 查看航空公司的網站**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""比較搜尋結果之餘，也查查看航空公司本身的網站再下單有其回報。"" This directly recommends checking the airline's website.
* While options A and C are good steps to take in the process, the passage highlights the importance of checking the airline's website after searching and comparing.
* Option B is contrary to the first sentence of the passage.
"
根據這段文字，旅客首先應該做什麼才能確保最優惠的航班價格？,"The correct answer is **B: 比較不同資料彙集網站之間的價格**.

The passage states that people compare prices on different websites before booking. It also mentions that while comparing, it's worthwhile to check the airline's website. Thus, comparing prices on different websites should be done first.
"
何時需要人員陪同送貨？,"The correct answer is **C: 物品作為拖運行李寄送時**

The passage states that the only way to get faster delivery is to send the goods as checked baggage, but airlines prohibit this for non-passengers. This implies that a person needs to accompany the goods when they are sent as checked baggage."
根據這段文字，在航空聯盟中選擇飛行常客航空公司時，你應該優先考慮以下何者？,"The correct answer is **A: 提供最多點數的航空公司 (Providing the most points)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...you should be aware that the benefits they offer often vary, and different airlines within the same alliance may offer more frequent flyer points."" This directly points to prioritizing the airline that gives you the most points.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best choice:

* **B: 屬於最大航空聯盟的航空公司 (Belonging to the largest airline alliance):** The passage does not talk about selecting a large airline alliance.
* **C: 你最常搭乘旅行的航空公司 (The airline you travel most often with):** The passage explicitly advises against this, saying, ""While it may seem intuitive to join the airline you fly most often,...""
* **D: 可能另外增加特別待遇的航空公司 (Airline that may offer additional special treatment):** The passage touches on ""benefits they offer,"" but the primary focus is on the difference in point accumulation.
"
根據這段文字，哪家航空公司可能會給予更多的飛行常客點數？,"The correct answer is **D: 相同聯盟中的不同航空公司**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...但你應留意他們提供的優惠通常不同，而且**相同聯盟的不同航空公司**給予的飛行常客點數可能會更多。""
"
根據這段文字，以下哪些感官會因過量飲酒而受損？,"根據文章，過量飲酒可能導致**B: 視覺**受損 (失明)。
"
如文中所述，做什麼事可能可以減輕酒精的有害影響？,"The passage clearly states ""飲用酒精性飲料要適量"" (Drink alcoholic beverages in moderation). This is the key to reducing the harmful effects of alcohol.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 適量飲酒 (Drink in moderation)**.
"
阿姆斯特丹地產價值最高的地方在哪裡？,"The passage states that the Canal District (Grachtengordel) has the highest property values in the country. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: 運河區 (Canal District)**
"
為什麼聯合國教科文組織將運河區指定為世界遺產？,"正確答案是 **A: 它的歷史和文化價值**。

原文明確指出，運河區被列為世界遺產是 ""由於其獨特的文化與歷史價值""。
"
根據這段文字，下列豬山寺廟的哪一點值得一訪？,"The correct answer is **A: 洞里薩湖的景色 (洞里薩湖的景色)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""神廟陰鬱的氣氛和洞里薩湖的美景，讓攀登到山頂的這段路程值回票價 (The somber atmosphere of the temple and the beautiful view of Tonle Sap Lake make the climb to the top worthwhile).""  The other options are either not reasons to visit the temple itself, or are related to logistics of the trip.
"
根據這段文字，遊客需要什麼才能進入豬山寺廟？,"The correct answer is **C: 取得吳哥窟通行證 (Acquire an Angkor Pass)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""必須持吳哥窟通行證才能進入神廟 (An Angkor Pass is required to enter the temple).

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A:** The text mentions the temple was built *during* the reign of King Yasovarman, not that you need to hike through a temple named after him.
*   **B:** While the temple is near Siem Reap, there's no requirement to tour the city to visit it.
*   **D:** While a boat trip on Tonle Sap can be combined with the visit, it's not required for entry to the temple itself.
"
根據這段文字，以下何者能阻止遊客到訪南極洲？,"The correct answer is **A: 高昂的旅行預算**.

The passage explicitly states that visiting Antarctica is ""花費頗高"" (expensive). The other options are either inaccurate based on the passage:

*   **B: 僅羅斯海值得探索** - The passage mentions the peninsula, islands, and the Ross Sea as common areas visited, but doesn't imply they are the *only* worthwhile places.
*   **C: 能夠在十二月和一月旅行的工作時程** - The passage states the visiting season is from November to February, so December and January fall within that window.
*   **D: 受限的身體行動力** - The passage states that visiting Antarctica requires physical endurance, so this could deter visitors. But A is a better answer since the passage mentions cost."
對登山感興趣的遊客可能會參觀南極洲的哪個部分？,"根據文章內容，內陸地區是專家「偶爾會搭機進入南極州內陸登山」的地方。 因此，正確答案是：

**B: 內陸地區**
"
前現代天文台最不可能位於何處？,"正確答案是 **C: 偏遠之地**。

理由如下：

*   P 指出，前現代天文台通常位於城市或校園中，這些都是容易到達的地方。
*   P 還提到現代研究型望遠鏡才位於偏遠地區，所以前現代天文台 *最不可能* 位於偏遠之地。"
現代研究型望遠鏡可能安置在哪裡？,"The correct answer is **D: 大型設施**.

The passage states that modern research telescopes are ""巨大的設施，座落於有大氣條件良好的偏遠地區"" which translates to ""huge facilities located in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions"".
"
根據這段文字，哪個區域最適合寧靜的海灘日？,"The correct answer is **C: North Shore**. Here's why:

*   The passage says North Shore beaches are located on the Pacific coast, stretching from Long Bay to Devonport.
*   It further states that those beaches are mostly sandy, safe for swimming, and offer shade from Pohutukawa trees (New Zealand Christmas trees).
*   Mission Bay and St. Heliers (part of Tamaki Drive) are described as family beaches that are *sometimes crowded* with shops lining the shore, implying they are less tranquil.
*   While Tamaki Drive beaches are also safe to swim, the mention of crowds and nearby shops suggests a busier environment than the North Shore beaches.

Therefore, North Shore offers a better prospect for a quiet beach day because of the natural shade and the lack of an explicit mention of crowding compared to Tamaki Drive beaches."
根據這段文字，哪裡的游泳條件可能最為安全？,"The correct answer is **B: 北港區**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""北岸海灘（北港區）... 那些地方幾乎都是能讓人安全游泳的沙灘..."" which directly implies that the beaches in the North Shore (North Harbour) area are generally safe for swimming.

*   Devonport and Long Bay are specifically mentioned as being *part* of the North Shore beaches, but the statement about safety refers to the *entire* North Shore area ( 北港區 ).

*   奥克兰中央区 refers to the Tamaki Drive beaches which are described as ""safe"" but also sometimes crowded. The North Harbour beaches are described as *generally* safe, implying a broader consistency in safe swimming conditions.
"
到訪文中所述的位置時，下列何者會被視為不合時宜的舉動？,"The correct answer is **B, C, and D**.

The passage explicitly states:

*   Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis (C)
*   Do not mark or deface the buildings (D)
*   Treat the site with proper decorum, solemnity, and respect. (Implies A is appropriate and the opposite inappropriate)

Thus, leaving markings on the site or making jokes would be inappropriate. Behaving solemnly and with respect (A) would be appropriate.
"
以下何者說明了通用語言？,"根據 P 的定義，通用語是「因某種原因而成為其他語言使用者之間的交流方式，所以成為主要語言」。這表示通用語是自然發展出來的，而非人工建構的。

因此，正確答案是 **D: 是有機的**。 有機的意指自然產生、演進，與人工建構相反。
"
關於輔助語言的描述，以下說法何者不正確？,"Based on the provided text (P), the following statement is incorrect:

*   **B: 它們是自然且建構而成的語言**

Here's why:

*   **P** explicitly states that auxiliary languages are **artificial or constructed**. Option B contradicts this by suggesting they are also ""natural.""

Let's analyze the other options:

*   **A: 它們是有機語言，用於輔助可能無法互相理解的人之間的溝通** - This is partially correct (they are used to help people who can't understand each other), but calling them ""organic languages"" is incorrect as per passage P. Therefore, it's a wrong statement.
*   **C: 它們是為改善溝通困難的場景而建構的語言** - This aligns with the description of auxiliary languages in **P** (designed to aid communication).
*   **D: 它們是不同語言使用者之間所創造的具主導地位的語言** - This aligns with the description of auxiliary languages in **P** (become a way for speakers of other languages to communicate with each other).

**Therefore, option B is the most incorrect statement.**"
根據這段文字，如果乘客是搭乘冬季郵輪，他們應該檢查什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **A: 艙房位置**.

The passage directly states: ""若是冬季穿越北波羅的海，請確認您艙房的位置，因為對受影響最嚴重的艙房，穿過浮冰會產生非常可怕的噪音。"" This indicates passengers should check their cabin location due to potential noise from ice.
"
根據這段文字，如果乘客是搭乘夏季郵輪，他們可能可以避免什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **B: 穿過浮冰**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states that crossing ice floes is a problem in *winter* and affects cabin noise. Therefore, taking a summer cruise would likely avoid this.
*   The text states that St. Petersburg cruises involve city tours. This does not imply that city tours can be avoided by traveling in summer.
*   The text says that passengers do not need visas for St. Petersburg cruise itineraries (check regulations). This rule is likely the same during summer.
*   The text does not imply that traveling in the summer would cause one to avoid St. Petersburg."
為什麼巴塞隆納的標誌和廣播經常使用加泰隆尼亞語？,"The correct answer is **B: 它是該市的第一官方語言**.

The passage states: ""大部分的標誌都只用加泰隆語顯示，因為它是法律規定的第一官方語言。"" This directly supports option B.
"

The passage explicitly states: ""地鐵中的固定廣播只有加泰羅尼亞語"".
"
根據這段文字，高端市場中的寢具用品和早餐不太可能優先考慮以下哪些設施？,"根據文章，高端 B&B 市場主要競爭點是寢具和早餐。 特色古董家具、維護良好的戶外空間都是頂級場所可能有的設施，特製佳餚菜單屬於早餐的範疇。

因此，選項中與寢具和早餐競爭力無直接關聯的是 **D: 快速的無線網路**。
"
根據這段文字，以下何者不是豪華民宿之間的競爭要點之一？,"根據這段文字，豪華民宿之間的競爭要點主要有：

*   **寢具用品 (高檔寢具):** 提及 ""最奢華的寢具，也許是手工被單或骨董床""
*   **早餐 (各種季節性早餐 和 當地採購的食物和飲料):** 提及 ""早餐可能包含當地的季節性美食或民宿主人的特製佳餚""

這段文字並沒有提到 ""現代裝飾"" 是競爭要點之一。

因此，正確答案是 **A: 現代裝飾**。
"
根據這段文字，2022 年北京不會舉辦以下何者？,"The correct answer is **B: 太子城滑雪區活動 (Tai Zi Cheng Ski Area activities)**.

The passage states that ski activities will be held in Tai Zi Cheng, not Beijing. The other options are all explicitly mentioned as being held in Beijing.
"
根據這段文字，2022 年北京會舉辦以下何者？,"The correct answer is **B, C, and D**.

Here's why:

*   **B: 在室內舉辦的冰上項目 (Indoor ice sports):** The passage explicitly states that Beijing will host indoor ice sports.
*   **C: 冬季奧運會 (Winter Olympics):** The first sentence confirms that Beijing will host the 2022 Winter Olympics.
*   **D: 閉幕式 (Closing ceremony):** The passage indicates that Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies.

Option A is incorrect, as Beijing will host the *Winter* Olympics, not the Summer Olympics.
"
誰感染禽流感的風險最高？,"根據文章內容，正確答案是 **C: 家禽飼養從業人員**。

文章明確指出：「大部分的案例都是家禽飼養從業人員」。雖然賞鳥者也有一些風險，但家禽飼養從業人員的風險更高。
"
根據這段文字，關於禽流感的描述，以下說法何者正確？,"The correct answer is **C: 賞鳥者有被感染的風險**.

Here's why:

*   **P states:** ""...但賞鳥者也會有一些風險 (but birdwatchers also have some risk)."" This directly supports option C.
*   **選項 A不正確:** The text says ""大部分的案例都是家禽飼養從業人員 (most cases are poultry workers)"", not *only* poultry workers.
*   **選項 B不正確:** The text only discusses the number of cases in humans and doesn't make any comparison to the number of cases in birds.
*   **選項 D不正確:** The text says ""有些是致命的 (some are fatal)"", not *all* cases.

Therefore, only option C is directly supported by the provided text."
白海-波羅的海運河連接了什麼地方？,"The correct answer is **C: 北極海和波羅的海**.

The passage states: ""白海-波羅的海運河...主要以河川和湖泊將北極海和波羅的海連在一起。"" (The White Sea-Baltic Canal...mainly connects the Arctic Sea and the Baltic Sea with rivers and lakes).
"
根據這段文字，為了避免打擾乘客，護照可能會在什麼類型的交通工具上被收走？,"The correct answer is **B: 夜間臥鋪火車**

The passage specifically states that ""搭乘夜間臥鋪火車時，列車長可能會將護照收走，這樣就不會打斷你的睡眠.""
"
根據這段文字，在某些跨境火車上，何時可能會查驗你的身分證？,"The correct answer is **D: 火車行進時 (When the train is moving)**.

"
留在新加坡的高熱帶地區時，最有可能出現以下哪種問題？,"The passage highlights the high temperature and strong sun as the main challenges of being in Singapore's ""high tropical"" location. Therefore, the most likely problem is **C: 中暑 (heatstroke)**.
"
誰可能會不想吃德國糕點？,"正確答案是 A: 對堅果嚴重過敏的人。

原因：

* **原文提及德國糕點常含有杏仁、榛果等堅果。** 對堅果過敏的人當然會避免食用可能含有堅果的食物，以避免過敏反應。
* 其他選項則沒有直接根據原文，沒有直接指出什麼人*可能*不想吃德國糕點。
"
哪種食材屬於德國糕點的季節性元素？,"The correct answer is **C: 李子 (Plums)**.

The passage states that ""櫻桃與李子則在夏日會出現在餐桌上 (Cherries and plums appear on the table in summer)"". This indicates a seasonal connection. While apples are used year-round, plums are specifically mentioned as a summer ingredient in German pastries. The other options, hazelnuts and almonds, are described as common ingredients in many German baked goods, not specifically tied to a season.
"
根據這段文字，針對預算有限的旅行而言，以下何者並非推薦方法？,"The correct answer is **C: 跟人要錢 (Begging)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that it will focus on methods of *limiting expenses* and that the advice assumes the traveler will *not* beg. While finding work (A) might be a way to fund your travels, this passage states it will focus on limiting expenses to bring the cost closer to zero instead.
*   The passage says you will need to *sacrifice comfort* (B) to lower your expenses.
*   The passage states that you must *limit your expenses* (D) to bring the cost closer to zero.

Therefore, begging is the only option specifically ruled out by the text."
根據這段文字，誰可能很難以最低預算旅行？,"根據文章，以下是可能很難以最低預算旅行的人：

*   **D: 喜歡按照預定行程走的人**。 文章提到，以最低預算旅行需要願意犧牲「可預測性」。預定的行程與可預測性密切相關，因此喜歡預定行程的人可能不適合這種旅行方式。

其他選項的原因：

*   **A: 歡迎挑戰的人**：文章暗示以最低預算旅行是一種挑戰，因此歡迎挑戰的人反而可能更適合。
*   **B: 沒有嚴格時間限制的人**：文章提到以最低預算旅行需要願意犧牲「時間」，所以沒有時間限制的人反而適合。
*   **C: 計劃在旅行時遠端工作的人**：文章區分了在旅途中工作和限制開支這兩種旅行方式，但沒有暗示遠端工作會妨礙以最低預算旅行。

**因此，正確答案是 D。**
"
關於波恩馬里恩和費爾蒙特之間的車程，以下說法何者不正確？,"The passage states the following:

*   ""波恩馬里恩和費爾蒙特之間的路段，途中經過許多偏僻的荒涼地區"" - supports A (有長長的偏遠鄉村道路)
*   ""陡坡、窄道和急彎占了絕大多數"" - supports B (車道很窄)
*   ""行動通訊服務比沿途其他路段還要強得多"" - supports D (行動通訊服務應該不是問題)
*   ""速限公告明顯低於前一段路和下一段路，一般為 35 至 40 英里 / 小時（56 至 64 公里 / 小時），嚴格遵守這些速限甚至比其他路段更重要。"" - The passage stresses the importance of obeying the speed limits, but does not say that very few people do

Therefore, the incorrect statement is C (很少人遵守速度限制).

**Correct Answer: C**
"
根據這段文字，在水牛城─匹茲堡高速公路上行駛的駕駛應該主要關心哪些事項？,"The correct answer is **C: 急彎轉太快 (Taking curves too fast)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage emphasizes the challenging driving conditions:** ""陡坡、窄道和急彎占了絕大多數"" (Steep hills, narrow roads, and sharp curves are predominant).
*   **It highlights the importance of obeying speed limits:** ""嚴格遵守這些速限甚至比其他路段更重要"" (Strict adherence to these speed limits is even more important than on other sections).
*   **It explicitly mentions lower speed limits:**""一般為 35 至 40 英里 / 小時（56 至 64 公里 / 小時）"" (Generally between 35 and 40 mph).

All these points suggest that the primary concern for drivers should be navigating the sharp curves safely, which means avoiding taking them too fast.

Here's why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **A: 困在擁擠的車陣中 (Being stuck in heavy traffic):** The passage doesn't mention anything about traffic congestion. It focuses on the road's physical characteristics.
*   **B: 缺乏足夠的行動通訊服務 (Lack of adequate cell service):** The passage actually states the *opposite*, noting that cell service is stronger in this area than in others.
*   **D: 遇上頻繁的道路施工 (Encountering frequent road work):** Road construction is not mentioned at all in the passage."
如果要開始溪降，以下哪一點非必要？,"根據文章敘述，溪降結合了游泳、攀爬和跳躍。文章也說訓練或身體狀態的入門要求相對較低。

因此：

*   A 游泳能力是必要的 (文章提到游泳是溪降的要素)
*   B 巔峰體能狀態不是必要的 (文章提到入門要求相對較低)
*   C 跳躍能力是必要的 (文章提到跳躍是溪降的要素)
*   D 少量訓練是必要的 (因為要練習游泳,跳躍,攀爬)

所以答案是 **B: 巔峰體能狀態**
"
以下何者是成功的溪降之旅所不能少的？,"根據P段文字，溪降結合了游泳、攀爬和跳躍等要素。雖然入門要求相對較低，但仍然需要基本的游泳能力。選項中只有D包含游泳能力，因此是成功溪降之旅所不能少的。

所以答案是 **D: 游泳能力**
"
根據這段文字，對於打算進行汽車露營的人來說，什麼事情會有所幫助？,"The correct answer is **B: 座椅能放平的車輛**.

The text explicitly states that ""If you have a large minivan, SUV, sedan or station wagon with seats that fold flat, you can go car camping.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 深入了解自身車輛的侷限** While knowing your vehicle's limitations is generally helpful for any road trip, the passage says you likely already know them. It's not specifically about *car camping*.
*   **C: 一頂帳篷** The text implies that tents are *not* ideal for car camping because they attract unwanted attention.
*   **D: 用於露營的私人土地** The text states setting up a tent on private land can attract unwanted attention. It does not imply that private land is generally helpful for car camping.
"
根據這段文字，如果汽車露營者希望保持低調，他們可能想要避免什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **C: 在城裡或私人土地上搭帳篷 (In the city or on private land, pitch a tent.)**

The passage states that pitching a tent on private land or in towns is likely to attract unwanted attention. This directly supports option C as something car campers would want to avoid to remain discreet.
"
根據這段文字，是誰二度重建了卡薩布蘭卡？,"Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
The text states that the Portuguese rebuilt the city after leveling it, but they abandoned it after an earthquake. The Moroccan Sultan then rebuilt the city. Thus, the Moroccan Sultan rebuilt Casablanca for the second time.
"
在自然災害後，誰拋棄了現代城市卡薩布蘭卡？,"The correct answer is **B: 葡萄牙人**.

The passage states that the Portuguese abandoned the city after an earthquake in 1755.
"
根據這段文字，辛特拉是如何廣為外國人所知？,"The correct answer is **C: 拜倫男爵的正面評價 (拜倫男爵的正面評價)**.

The text explicitly states that Sintra is famous with foreigners ""because Lord Byron vividly described its beauty.""
"
亞美尼亞不承認什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **D: 新共和國 (New Republic)**.

The passage states: ""然而，沒有任何已成立的國家正式承認它，就連亞美尼亞也不承認。"" (""However, no established country has officially recognized it, not even Armenia."") The ""it"" refers to the new republic that was formed in Nagorno-Karabakh.
"
何者持續影響亞塞拜然與亞美尼亞之間的關係？,"The best answer is **C: 外交爭論**.

While all the options are related to the conflict, the question asks what *continues* to affect the relationship. The 1994 war is in the past, though its consequences are felt. The presence of Armenians in Azerbaijan is also a consequence, and while it could be a source of tension, the passage implies that the *diplomatic dispute* about the region is the active, ongoing problem. Nagorno-Karabakh is the *subject* of the dispute, but not the dispute itself.

Therefore, the diplomatic dispute is the most accurate answer to what *continues* to damage relations.
"
在夏洛特搭乘計程車時，何者可能會導致額外費用？,"正確答案是 **B: 有三名乘客**。

文章指出，超過兩名乘客需支付額外的計程車費用。
"
根據這段文字，帶著孩子在夏洛特一起生活有什麼缺點？,"正確答案是 **B: 搭乘計程車**

以下說明原因：

*   這段文字提到，夏洛特對於親子家庭來說是一個很棒的地方，提供了許多高品質的選擇。因此，選項 A、C 和 D 都不是缺點。

*   雖然計程車在某些情況下很方便，但這段文字特別指出，超過兩名乘客需要支付額外費用，這可能是不必要的開銷。因此，對於有孩子的家庭來說，搭乘計程車的成本會是一項缺點。"
在西班牙人抵達前，是誰控制了智利北部？,"The correct answer is **D: 印加人**.

The passage states: ""在西班牙人於 16 世紀抵達智利前，其北部受印加帝國統治..."" (Before the Spanish arrived in Chile in the 16th century, its northern part was ruled by the Inca Empire...)
"
根據這段文字，以下何者未在 1810 年發生？,"The correct answer is **B: 智利戰勝西班牙 (Chile defeating Spain)**.

The passage states that Chile declared independence in 1810, which coincided with the Napoleonic Wars and Spain's lack of a functional central government. However, Chile didn't decisively defeat Spain until 1818.
"
人們如何到達利古里亞地區的偏遠村莊？,"The passage states: ""步道、火車與船隻串起了村莊，而汽車卻無法從外頭開進這裡."" This means that cars are NOT an option for getting *into* the villages. Therefore, options A and B are incorrect. Option D is also incorrect as planes are not mentioned.

The passage *does* mention trains and boats as ways to connect the villages.

So the correct answer is **C: 搭乘火車或船** (Take trains or boats).
"
義大利文專門名稱「五鄉地」指的是什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 五座村莊 (Five villages)**.

The passage explicitly states that Cinque Terre ""由義大利利古里亞地區的五座濱海小村莊組成"" (is composed of five coastal villages in the Liguria region of Italy).
"
根據這段文字，哪種類型的靴子適合冬季可能會有的濕滑狀況？,"The correct answer is **B: 具有鞋釘配備的靴子**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically mentions ""有些靴子帶有鞋釘"" as an option for slippery conditions.
*   The passage also mentions shoe soles with deep grooves with at least 5mm(1/5 inch) depth, this implies D is incorrect.
*   The passage specifically advises against high heels (""鞋跟應低且寬""). This eliminates C.
*   The passage never says ""細跟靴"", so option A is incorrect.
"
何者無助於改善冬季結冰路面的摩擦力？,"The passage states that sand, gravel, and salt are used to increase friction on icy roads. Therefore, the only option that is not mentioned as helping to improve friction is water.

The correct answer is D: 水
"
關於夏威夷和庫克群島之間的相似之處，以下何者正確？,"The correct answer is **C: 它們共用相同的時區** (They share the same time zone).

The passage states: ""因為群島跟夏威夷同時區，所以有時又被稱為「南半球夏威夷」"" (Because the islands are in the same time zone as Hawaii, they are sometimes called the ""Hawaii of the Southern Hemisphere"").

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 它們都有很多大型飯店** (They both have many large hotels): The passage implies the opposite is true for the Cook Islands. It mentions that the Cook Islands remind older travelers of a time *before* large hotels became prevalent in Hawaii.
*   **B: 它們都沒有獨立的國家地位** (Neither of them have independent national status): The passage states that the Cook Islands are an island country in free association with New Zealand. This implies a level of independence, or at least self-governance, that contradicts the statement. Hawaii is part of the USA.
*   **D: 它們都沒有都市** (Neither of them have cities): The passage indicates that the Cook Islands don't have cities, but it doesn't make the same claim about Hawaii. We know Hawaii has cities."
關於庫克群島的描述，以下何者不正確？,"The correct answer is **C: 主要城市是拉羅湯加島及艾圖塔基島 (The main cities are Rarotonga and Aitutaki Islands)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the Cook Islands **do not have any cities**. It only consists of fifteen different islands.
*   Rarotonga and Aitutaki are listed as **main islands**, not main cities.
*   The other options are all mentioned in the paragraph:

    *   A: It is smaller than Hawaii - implied by the comparison of older Hawaii to the Cook Islands
    *   B: It is an archipelago - directly stated
    *   D: The island nation shares the same time zone as Hawaii - directly stated"
以下哪個林區管理站提供兩種類型的住宿選項？,"正確答案是 A: 西雷納。

說明：

* 段落中明確指出「只有西雷納林區管理站提供露營地以外的合宿房與熱食。」這表示西雷納同時提供露營地和合宿房兩種住宿選項。
* 其他選項（洛斯帕托斯、拉萊歐那、聖佩德里羅）都只提供露營地，沒有其他住宿選項。
"
根據這段文字，如果你想付現而非使用信用卡付款，你可以在哪裡預訂公園通行證？,"正確答案是 **B: 希門尼斯港**。

文字指出：「您可能可以直接從希門尼斯港的公園管理處預定通行證，但他們不收信用卡。」這表示你可以在希門尼斯港的公園管理處預訂並以現金付款。

其他選項不正確的原因：
*   A: 西雷納 - 文字中沒有提到西雷納可以預訂通行證。
*   C: El Sol 網咖 - 文字中提到 El Sol 網咖 提供預約服務，但它會收費，沒有提到是否接受現金。
*   D: 拉萊歐那 - 文字中沒有提到拉萊歐那可以預訂通行證。"
根據這段文字，哪種滑雪是在更陡峭的地形上進行？,"正確答案是 **C: 阿爾卑斯式**

這段文字說 ""阿爾卑斯式登山滑雪類似，但通常不涉及高山滑雪與登山，這兩種活動在陡峭地形中進行，需要更堅固的滑雪板和雪靴。"" 這表示高山滑雪與登山，這兩種活動，包含阿爾卑斯式登山滑雪，是在陡峭地形上進行的。 因此，C 是最符合原文描述的答案。
"
根據這段文字，對於追求更高速度的山岳滑雪者，什麼東西會有幫助？,"The passage states that ""你鮮少在淨空雪道上達到無重裝越野滑雪的速度."" This implies that a clear, unburdened snow track would help to reach higher speeds.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: 淨空的雪道 (淨空的雪道)**.
"
經歷逆向文化衝擊的旅客很難做到什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **D: 重新適應國內文化**.

The passage explicitly states that reverse culture shock makes it difficult for returning travelers to readjust to their home culture. The other options are incorrect because the passage doesn't imply difficulty in adapting to new cultures (rather, it states the opposite), maintaining patience, or traveling abroad.
"
根據這段文字，逆向文化衝擊對於哪種遊客而言可能特別困難？,"The correct answer is **B: 在國外生活時迅速適應的遊客**.

The passage states: ""對於容易適應新文化的遊客來說，有時重新調整融入自身的本土文化反而特別難。"" This directly translates to: ""For tourists who easily adapt to new cultures, sometimes readjusting and integrating back into their own native culture is particularly difficult.""
"
人們應該避免對駝鹿做以下哪種事情？,"正確答案是 **C: 將牠們的潛在威脅程度降至最低**

**解釋:**

*   P 的重點是人們低估了駝鹿的危險性，導致靠得太近而陷入危險。
*   C 直接呼應了這個問題。 如果人們忽略或低估了駝鹿的潛在威脅，他們就更有可能做出危險的行為 (例如靠太近)。
*   A: 忽略牠們的存在也是一種低估威脅的方式，但 C 更直接地表達了低估威脅的行為。
*   B: 過度緩慢地靠近可能不安全，但並非直接與「低估危險」有關。
*   D: 從遠處觀察是相對安全的行為，與問題提出的風險相反。

因此，C 是最符合前提的答案。
"
根據這段文字，關於駝鹿的說法中，以下何者為非？,"The correct answer is **A: 牠們是天生就具有攻擊性的動物**

The passage explicitly states that moose are NOT naturally aggressive. All the other options are supported by the passage.
"
根據這段文字，以下何者對沙漠旅客來說最不危險？,"The correct answer is **B: 看見海市蜃樓造成的水的影像 (Seeing a mirage of water)**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 寒冷的夜晚缺乏保暖的衣服 (Lacking warm clothing on a cold night)**: The passage states this poses a risk of hypothermia, making it dangerous.
*   **C: 浪費能量去追逐海市蜃樓 (Wasting energy chasing mirages)**: The passage directly states that this is dangerous.
*   **D: 浪費水去追逐海市蜃樓 (Wasting water chasing mirages)**: The passage directly states that this is dangerous.
*   **B: 看見海市蜃樓造成的水的影像 (Seeing a mirage of water)**: Simply *seeing* the mirage isn't dangerous in itself. The danger lies in believing it and acting on that belief by chasing after it and wasting resources.

Therefore, seeing a mirage is the least dangerous option."
以下何者未被提及為沙漠旅客的潛在威脅？,"根據文章內容：

*   **缺水** 是暗示的威脅，因為文章提到旅行者會浪費水追逐海市蜃樓。
*   **海市蜃樓** 被明確提及為一種潛在的危險，因為它會誤導旅行者。
*   **失溫** 被明確提及為夜晚的威脅。
*   **曬傷** 並未在文章中被提及。

因此，正確答案是 **D: 曬傷**。"
根據這段文字，探險家抵達後，哪個群體的人口受到了很大的影響？,"The correct answer is **C: 泰諾人 (Taino people)**.

The passage states: ""在歐洲探險家抵達後的短短幾年內，塔伊諾城的人口遭到西班牙征服者大幅地削減"" which directly translates to: ""In the short years after the arrival of European explorers, the population of the Taino cities was greatly reduced by the Spanish conquistadors.""
"
根據這段文字，加勒比人說的是哪種語言？,"The correct answer is **D: 阿拉瓦語**.

The passage states: ""加勒比人说的是阿拉瓦语系"".
"
將滑雪當成娛樂活動推廣一事應歸功於何人？,"The passage states: ""挪威人在澳洲開設了第一間休閒滑雪俱樂部."" This indicates the Norwegians were involved in establishing recreational skiing.

Therefore, the answer is **B: 挪威人**
"
根據這段文字，滑雪大約在何時首次被視為一項運動？,"The correct answer is **C: 1861 年**.

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""...1861 年，挪威人在澳洲開設了第一間休閒滑雪俱樂部."" This indicates that 1861 is the year mentioned as the first recorded establishment of recreational skiing.

While skiing existed long before (as evidenced by the cave paintings), it wasn't necessarily considered a *sport* in the organized, recreational sense until the establishment of ski clubs.
"
以下何者通常與東非沿岸最大的島嶼有關？,"The correct answer is **C: 野生動植物 (Wildlife)**.

The passage states: ""馬達加斯加是其中最大的一座島，野生動植物豐富，使該島本身自成一塊大陸 (Madagascar is the largest of these islands, with abundant wildlife, making the island a continent in its own right)."" This directly links Madagascar, the largest island, with abundant wildlife.
"
何者並非較小的東非群島屬性？ ,"The correct answer is **C: 以野生動植物聞名**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Madagascar is known for its wildlife and being ""its own continent"" due to its unique flora and fauna.
*   The passage specifically says ""most smaller islands are independent nations or have ties to France and are known for luxurious beach resorts"".
*   Thus, the attribute ""known for its wildlife"" is more applicable to Madagascar than the smaller islands."
根據這段文字，某些特別傳統的教堂會如何慶祝復活節？,"The correct answer is **B: 在週六晚上舉辦復活節守夜祈禱會 (In the early hours of Sunday morning)**.

The passage explicitly states that ""較傳統的教堂通常會在復活節週末的週六夜晚舉辦一場復活節守夜祈禱會"" (More traditional churches usually hold an Easter Vigil service on Saturday night of Easter weekend).
"
為了避免入境厄瓜多時的某些要求，古巴公民必須先擁有什麼？,"The best answer is **D: 美國綠卡**

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states that ""持有美國綠卡的古巴公民應前往厄瓜多領事館，獲得這些條件的豁免權."" This means holding a US green card can exempt them from some of the requirements.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: 自旅行日期起，具有 6 個月以上有效期限的護照:** While required, it doesn't exempt them from other requirements.
*   **B: 公證過的邀請函:** This is the requirement that holding a US green card potentially helps avoid, not something you must *already* have to avoid other requirements.
*   **C: 證明停留時間的往返機票:** This is another general requirement, not something that provides an exemption.

Therefore, the most direct answer based on the provided text is that a US green card allows a Cuban citizen to potentially avoid some requirements for entering Ecuador."
何者並非厄瓜多旅行要求的規劃目的？,"The correct answer is **A: 將旅客人數降至最低 (Minimize the number of travelers)**.

Here's why:

* **B: 讓遷徙活動更井然有序 (To make migration activities more organized):** The passage explicitly states this is a goal.
* **C: 確認旅客的停留時間 (To confirm the length of stay of travelers):** The requirement for a return or onward ticket confirms this.
* **D: 確保護照的有效期限 (To ensure the validity of passports):** The 6-month passport validity requirement directly addresses this.

The passage focuses on *regulating* migration, not necessarily *reducing* it. The aim is to make the process more orderly and controlled, not to minimize the number of people traveling.
"
以下何者的花費國外比國內更高？,"根據文章內容：

*   **高級眼鏡框:** 文章提到在低收入國家，真正進口的名牌商品售價可能比原產地更昂貴。

所以正確答案是 **B: 高級眼鏡框**
"
在國外購買高級眼鏡框可能會有什麼風險？,"The passage states that ""有些可能是仿冒品，而真正的進口名牌商品售價可能比原產地更昂貴."" This directly translates to the risk of buying counterfeit frames. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: 眼鏡框可能是仿冒品**
"
關於福克蘭群島的貨幣使用，以下哪種說法為真？,"Let's analyze each option based on the given text:

*   **A: 外島僅接受信用卡和英鎊 (Outer islands only accept credit cards and GBP)** - This is incorrect. The passage states that credit cards are *unlikely* to be accepted on the outer islands.
*   **B: 史坦利是唯一接受美金的地方 (Stanley is the only place that accepts USD)** - This is incorrect. The text says USD *can* be accepted in Stanley, but doesn't exclude it from other places. It also says that outer islands *may* accept British and American currency.
*   **C: 福克蘭群島鎊應在離島後兌換 (Falkland Islands Pounds should be exchanged after leaving the islands)** - This is incorrect. The passage explicitly says it's *almost impossible* to exchange FKP outside the Falkland Islands, so you should exchange it *before* leaving.
*   **D: 除了福克蘭群島鎊 ，英鎊通常是接受度最高的貨幣 (Besides the Falkland Islands Pound, the British Pound is generally the most accepted currency)** - This is correct. The passage states that GBP is ""generally accepted throughout the islands.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **D**."
根據這段文字，從美國到福克蘭群島旅行時，除了信用卡，其他付款方式在哪裡可能特別有用？,"The correct answer is **C: 外島**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that on **外島 (outer islands)**, UK and US currency **may** be accepted, but credit cards likely won't be.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   福克蘭群島公司西店 (Falkland Islands Company West Store): The passage only mentions this store as a landmark near the only bank for currency exchange.
*   遍及所有島嶼 (Throughout all the islands): The passage states that credit cards and USD are commonly accepted in Stanley, but not necessarily on other islands.
*   整個史坦利 (Throughout Stanley): While USD is often accepted in Stanley, the question asks where *other* payment methods besides credit cards would be *particularly* useful.
"
哪個事件與廟宇慶典的慶祝活動無關？,"The correct answer is **A: 大象的誕生 (The birth of an elephant)**.

The passage mentions temple anniversaries, deities' birthdays, and other important events related to the temple as reasons for celebration. The birth of an elephant is not mentioned.
"
哪裡可以看到佩戴裝飾的大象？,"The best answer is **C: 寺廟的遊行 (Temple parades)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage directly links decorated elephants to temple celebrations/parades.** The passage says: ""去喀拉拉邦看寺廟慶典挺有意思的，他們定期會有佩戴裝飾的大象遊行... (Going to temple celebrations in Kerala is interesting, they regularly have parades of decorated elephants...)""

Let's look at why the other options are less ideal:

* **A: 從十一月底到五月中旬到處可見 (Visible everywhere from late November to mid-May)** While many temple festivals (and therefore parades with elephants) happen during this period, the elephants are NOT visible everywhere. They are specific to temple events.
* **B: 在寺廟裡 (In the temple)** While the elephants might be kept near the temple, the main point is their involvement in the parade.
* **D: 在喀拉拉邦的街道上 (On the streets of Kerala)** This is too broad. The elephants are specifically in parades associated with temples.
"
根據這段文字，以下何者是購買商務艙或頭等艙機票最可能的省錢方式？,"The passage directly states that ""讓公司出錢"" (let the company pay) is a ""更好的方式"" (better way) than paying out of pocket for first class or business class. Therefore, the answer is **A: 經由您的公司支出 (Through your company's expense).**
"
根據這段文字，在預訂特定票價的艙等時，搜尋什麼會浪費時間？,"The correct answer is **C: 優惠 (Discounts)**.

The passage states: ""試圖尋找商務艙或頭等艙座位優惠只是徒勞無益 (Trying to find discounts on business or first-class seats is simply futile)."" This directly indicates that searching for discounts is a waste of time.
"
在比較非洲的總票價與環球票價時，不需要加上什麼額外費用？,"The correct answer is **C: 非洲簽證的費用**.

The passage specifically mentions adding extra costs *outside* of Africa when considering round-the-world tickets.  The question asks what *doesn't* need to be added when comparing to a ticket *to* Africa. Therefore, costs associated with Africa (like African visas) are not part of the ""extra costs"" to consider for the round-the-world ticket.
"
根據這段文字，超市開始提供什麼更多樣化的選擇？,"The correct answer is **A: 即食品**.

The text explicitly states: ""越來越多超市開始提供更多樣化的**即食品**..."" The other options are related but not the direct answer to the question.
"
部分超市提供的哪些便利設施可能會吸引購買即食品的顧客？,"The correct answer is **D: 微波爐**.

Here's why:

*   **P mentions** ""部分超市甚至提供微波爐或其他設備以食物加熱"" 說明了部分超市會提供微波爐等設備以食物加熱。
*   **Q asks** ""部分超市提供的哪些便利設施可能會吸引購買即食品的顧客？"" 說明了會吸引顧客購買即食品的便利設施。
*   **微波爐** 作為加熱食物的設施，會吸引購買即食品的顧客。

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 附設餐廳:** While a restaurant is mentioned in the passage, the question specifically asks about facilities *within* the supermarket that make buying ready-to-eat food more appealing. A restaurant is a separate establishment, even if attached to the store.
*   **B: 較少變化的選擇:** Less variety would *discourage* customers from buying ready-to-eat meals.
*   **C: 生食:** 生食 is not considered as 即食品。"
講法語的比利時人和瑞士人可能聽不懂以下何者？,"正確答案是 **A: 標準的法文記數系統**

原因如下：

*   **P 指出比利時和瑞士的計數系統與法國不同。** 這表示他們日常使用的不是標準法文計數系統。
*   **P 也指出他們在學校學習標準法文，所以理解標準法文計數系統。** 然而，Q 問的是他們""可能聽不懂""什麼，而非他們是否知道。他們理解，但日常不使用，因此可能需要思考或適應才能完全理解。
*   **B 和 C 直接來自 P 的說明，表示比利時和瑞士法語區在字彙和發音上與法國有所不同。** 因此，他們可能聽不懂某些奇特的法文單字或發音。
*   **D 是個比較廣泛的說法，涵蓋了 B 和 C。** 因為比利時和瑞士法語區的法文與法國的法文有所不同，所以他們可能聽不懂法國最常說的法文的一些細微之處。

然而，選項 A 最直接地符合題幹的邏輯。雖然他們在學校學過標準法文計數系統，但日常並不使用，所以相較於 B、C、D，他們最有可能聽不懂標準法文計數系統 (需要轉換或思考)。

因此，答案是 **A**。"
以下何者在法國與在比利時或瑞士不同？,"根據段落內容，答案是：

**B: 記數系統**

原因：

*   段落明確指出，比利時法語區和瑞士的計數系統與法國不同。
*   A 錯了，段落說“某些字的發音也有些微差異”，不是所有單字。
*   C 錯了，段落說所有說法文的比利時人和瑞士人在學校都要學習標準法文。
*   D 沒有在段落中提到。"
哪種情況您不太可能得到喪親票價？,"正確答案是 **C: 如果您從巴黎搭乘漢莎航空飛往美國**

以下是原因：

*   **P** 表明漢莎航空只有 **從美國或加拿大出發** 的航班才提供喪親票價。如果您是從巴黎出發，則不符合資格。
*   **P** 聲明加拿大航空、達美航空和西捷航空都提供喪親票價。
*   **P** 聲明您必須直接透過航空公司訂票才能獲得喪親票價。"
關於喪親票價，何者為真？,"根據P段落的資訊，正確答案是：

**D: 必須直接打電話向航空公司預訂**

段落中明確指出 ""不論任何情況，都必須打電話直接跟航空公司訂位。""
"
何時使用獨立的 GPS 設備比 GPS 導航應用程式更方便？,"正確答案是 **C: 超出連線範圍時**

理由：

*   P 提到：「如果你的手機沒有數據連線，或者已經超出連線範圍，GPS 導航的表現可能會受到限制或無法使用。」 這句話暗示了當手機失去網路連線時，獨立的 GPS 設備可能更可靠，因為獨立 GPS 設備不需要網路連線也能運作。
*   其他選項不合理：
    *   A: 想省錢時 - P 指出 GPS App 通常比租用地圖便宜
    *   B: 確定會有數據連線時 - 有數據連線時，GPS App 很好用
    *   D: 不想租用 GPS 設備時 - 問題在於何時使用獨立 GPS 設備，這選項邏輯不通"
與獨立設備相比，何者並非使用 GPS 導航應用程式的好理由？,"The correct answer is **A: 無需擔心數據連線 (No need to worry about data connection)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that GPS navigation apps can be limited or unusable *without* a data connection. Therefore, needing to worry about a data connection is a *drawback* of using a GPS navigation app, not a good reason to use it.
*   The other options (B, C, and D) are all stated in the passage as benefits of using a GPS navigation app compared to other options."
根據這段文字，您如何保證您配到一艘適合的船？,"The correct answer is **C: 與身為加拉巴哥群島旅行專家的旅行社預訂**.

The passage states: ""Ensure the agency that books your trip is a Galapagos specialist and has extensive knowledge of the various vessels. This will ensure your particular interests and/or limitations are matched to the vessel best suited to them."" This directly supports option C.

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: 訂購有 8+ 興趣相似的乘客所組團的船票:** The passage doesn't mention finding a boat based on other passengers' interests. The focus is on matching *your* interests and limitations to the *ship*.
*   **B: 淡季預訂位:** Booking in the off-season might increase availability, but it doesn't guarantee the *right* boat for your needs.
*   **D: 提前訂位:** Booking early is recommended, but this ensures you get *a* boat, not necessarily the *best* boat for you.
"
根據這段文字，以下何者並非用來讓賓客不斷賭博的策略？,"正確答案是 **A: 充足的自然光線**

原因如下：

*   **P 段文字中說明賭場會避免自然光線 (沒有窗戶)，來混淆賓客的時間感。** 因此，充足的自然光線與賭場想讓賓客久留的策略背道而馳。
*   **B: 免費音樂會門票等鼓勵措施** 符合提供娛樂讓客人心情愉悅並留在現場的策略。
*   **C: 免費飲料** 符合提供餐飲讓客人留在現場的策略 (特別是酒精飲料，雖然同時也提到清醒的重要性，但免費提供酒精飲料的確是一種吸引客人並削弱判斷力的手段)。
*   **D: 沒有時鐘** 符合混淆賓客時間感的策略。"
根據這段文字，聰明的賭徒應該避免什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **A: 飲酒過量**.

The passage explicitly states that drinking alcohol impairs judgment, and good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
"
根據這段文字，句子中哪個詞性會大寫？,"The correct answer is **B: 名詞**.

The passage explicitly states that ""所有名詞以及 Sie （意思為'您'）一詞...仍然會以大寫字母開頭.""
"
根據這段文字，名詞大寫會讓什麼事更困難？,"根據文章，名詞大寫**使寫作變得更困難**，因為需要確認是否為名詞化的動詞或形容詞。

所以答案是 **C: 寫作**
"
在馬來西亞鄉下地區，哪個手勢代表「過來」？,"The correct answer is **B: 揮手**.

The passage states that in rural Malaysia, waving means ""come here"".
"
根據這段文字，哪個手勢可能代表「回來」？,"根據文章內容，正確答案是 **A: 手掌朝內的揮手**。

文章提到在西班牙的英國旅人可能會將手掌朝向揮手者（也就是手掌朝內）的揮手手勢誤認為是回來的意思。
"
根據這段文字，什麼狀況會導致隙縫發生？,"The correct answer is **B: 不穩定的冰河**.

The passage states: ""冰河並不穩定，而是會順著山脈流下。這種狀況會導致冰體斷裂或有隙縫..."" (Glaciers are not stable, but flow down mountains. This situation can lead to ice breakage or crevasses...). This directly links the instability of the glacier to the formation of crevasses.
"
根據這段文字，哪些東西會被雪橋遮蓋？,"正確答案是 **A: 隙縫**

文章明確指出「這種狀況會導致冰體斷裂或有隙縫，但可能會被雪橋掩蓋。」
"
根據這段文字，旅客到訪哪個地點之前應採取額外的預防措施？,"The correct answer is **B: 戈馬周邊地區**.

The text states: ""雖然戈馬還算安全，但若要到戈馬以外地區旅遊，就必須做足功課，瞭解北基伍省持續的戰亂狀況."" This directly implies that travel outside of Goma requires extra precautions due to ongoing conflict.
"
對戈馬的遊客來說，以下何者並非好意見？,"正確答案是 **A: 北基伍省的戰亂很好玩**。

解釋：

*   段落中說「若要到戈馬以外地區旅遊，就必須做足功課，瞭解北基伍省持續的戰亂狀況」。這表示戰亂是嚴肅且需要注意的潛在危險，而不是有趣的事。

其他選項在段落中都有提及，並可視為對遊客有用的資訊：

*   B: 段落提到戈馬提供「非洲一些最便宜的山地大猩猩追蹤活動」。
*   C: 段落中提到「可以使用 Boda-boda（摩托車計程車）遊覽戈馬」。
*   D: 段落提到「該城市也是攀登尼拉貢戈火山的基地」。"
8 月 1 日的野地許可證何時可用？,"The correct answer is **B: April 1st**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that permits for a given month become available for application four months prior on the 1st of the month.
*   To get a permit for August 1st, you need to count back four months: August -> July -> June -> May -> April.
*   Therefore, August 1st permits become available on April 1st."
為了保護峽谷而實行了什麼政策？,"正確答案是 **D: 許可證的數量有限**

解釋:

*   選項 D 敘述直接取自 P 段落的第一句話：「為了保護峽谷，許可證的數量有限…」。
*   選項 A 不正確，雖然現場登記是選項之一，但不是主要保護峽谷的政策。
*   選項 B 不正確，段落說明 5 月的許可證在 1 月 1 日開放申請，但並非所有月份的許可證都僅限 1 月 1 日申請。
*   選項 C 不正確，段落說明現場登記是選項之一，但不是取得許可證的唯一方法。

"
在文中所述的飯店類型中，最不可能找到以下何者？,"根據文章描述，這些旅館的特色是「過時的五金配件、沒有新型家電設施，以及特有的優雅年代感」。這表示他們刻意保留了舊時代的風格。

因此，最不可能找到的是：

**D: 近期經過現代升級翻修的客房**

其他選項都有可能存在：

*   **A: 雞尾酒吧**：文章提到這些飯店提供高級的夜生活，雞尾酒吧符合這個描述。
*   **B: 飯店附設的美食餐廳**：文章提到飯店提供高級的餐點，美食餐廳符合這個描述。
*   **C: 知名或一眼就能認出的其他客人**：文章提到這些飯店接待達官顯貴，因此吸引名人入住是合理的。"
根據段落所提供的資訊，飯店客人最不可能優先考慮以下哪些設施？,"The correct answer is **D: 實惠的房價 (Affordable room rates)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states these hotels catered to the wealthy (""富豪名流的下榻之處,"" ""手頭闊綽的旅客""). This implies cost is not a primary concern for their target clientele.
*   The passage mentions ""高級的餐點和夜生活,"" aligning with option B (餐廳) and C (酒吧).
*   The passage also mentions ""過時的五金配件...以及特有的優雅年代感"" which aligns with option A (古董傢俱).
    Therefore, affordable pricing is the *least* likely priority for guests of these hotels, based on the information given."
根據這段文字，前往格陵蘭島的旅客應該避免什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **D: 將格陵蘭島原住民稱為「愛斯基摩人」**.

The passage explicitly states that while the term ""Eskimo"" may be acceptable in the United States, many non-American Arctic peoples, especially Canadians, consider it offensive.  It goes on to say that foreigners should avoid using the term.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage states that crime is rare, and there are no ""dangerous zones.""
*   **B:** The passage says travelers *should* bring warm clothes, especially in colder months.
*   **C:** The passage describes Greenland as having developed internet and 93% of the population having internet access, contradicting the statement of having unstable internet connection."
根據這段文字，以下何者最有可能對毫無準備就到訪格陵蘭島的旅客造成問題？,"The passage states: ""The only real danger facing the unprepared is likely to be the cold weather."" It also mentions the nuisance of Nordic mosquitoes and potential sleep problems due to long daylight hours in summer. While these are problems, the cold weather is described as a ""real danger."" Crime is stated as being ""almost unheard of,"" and the passage doesn't suggest locals themselves pose a problem.

Therefore, the best answer is:

**C: 天氣**
"
以下何者現在當作中央廣場使用？,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**

The text states: ""如今此空間被當作中央廣場, 不論日夜都十分熱鬧."" which translates to: ""Today this space is used as a central square, bustling day and night."" The phrase ""此空間"" refers back to Jardín de la Unión.
"
根據這段文字，在 Jardín de la Unión 中找不到以下何者？,"The correct answer is **D: 古老的修道院建築 (Ancient monastery building)**

Here's why:

*   The text states that the *Templo de San Diego* is the **only remaining** structure of the original monastery. This implies the entire monastery is no longer there.
*   The text explicitly states:
    *   **A:** There are free concerts in the central kiosk in the afternoon and evening.
    *   **B:** Callejon del Beso (Kissing Alley) is the origin of an old love legend.
    *   **C:** There are several restaurants around the garden.

Therefore, the only option not found in Jardín de la Unión is the ancient monastery building. The remaining temple is the last piece but not the whole building.
"
根據這段文字，關於單日健行的說法中，以下何者會被認為不正確？,"正確答案是 **D: 單日健行這樣的戶外活動不適合有嬰兒的家庭**

段落中明確指出「帶著幼兒的家庭可能需要更多準備，不過就算是帶著嬰兒或是學齡前兒童，戶外一日遊也可以簡單達成。」這與選項 D 的說法相反。 因此，D 是不正確的。
"
根據這段文字，單日健行何時需要最低程度的準備？,"The correct answer is **B: 涉及更輕鬆的步道時**.

The passage states: ""輕鬆小徑的一日健行，不必做太多準備，任何體能適中的人都能享受這樣的健行."" This directly links easy trails with minimal preparation.
"
與挪威其他地區相比，羅加蘭或阿格德爾的高原有何不同？,"The passage states that in Rogaland and Agder, the plateaus (vidde) are often called ""hei,"" which means ""treeless moorland usually covered with heather.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: 它們通常佈滿石南花 (They are usually covered with heather)**.
"
根據這段文字，對挪威來說，以下何者並非典型的風景？,"The correct answer is **B: 森林茂密的高原**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes Norwegian plateaus (highlands) as ""vidde"" - wide, open, and treeless.** This directly contradicts the description of ""森林茂密的高原"".
* The passage also mentions ""hei"" which are treeless heaths.
* The passage specifically mentions陡峭的峽灣, 開闊的土地 and 荒野 as typical features of Norwegian landscape.
"
對滑雪有興趣的遊客應何時到訪山間小鎮？,"The correct answer is **A: 冬季期間 (Winter season)**.

The passage states that activities like skiing and snowboarding are offered in the mountain towns when there is snow, which occurs during the winter.
"
根據這段文字，山間小鎮通常何時遊客最多？,"The correct answer is **C: 印度的夏季期間 (The summer season in India)**.

The passage states: ""避暑勝地的旅遊季節，通常在印度的夏季期間達到頂峰 (The tourist season for hill stations typically peaks during the summer season in India)."" While the passage mentions winter activities, it explicitly says summer is the peak season.
"
如果希望找到尋求幫助的船，應該避免做什麼事情？,"基於原文，以下是分析：

*   **P 提到**：「您將遇到其他搭便船的旅行者，而他們將分享資訊給您。」這意味著與其他搭便船的人交流很重要。
*   **P 提到**：「貼出告示，表示願意提供幫助、在碼頭走來走去、主動接近正在洗船的遊艇主，並試著與酒吧裡的船員攀談等。」這表示在碼頭主動尋找機會、宣傳自己、與人交談都是重要的。

因此，**D: 忽略其他搭便船的人** 是最應該避免的，因為這會讓你錯失重要的資訊來源。

其他選項：

*   A: 在碼頭走來走去 - P 提到要「在碼頭走來走去」。
*   B: 與船長交朋友 - P 提到要「主動接近正在洗船的遊艇主」，也就是要與船長（或船主）建立聯繫。
*   C: 宣傳您的服務 - P 提到要「貼出告示，表示願意提供幫助」，也就是要宣傳自己的能力。

**所以答案是 D。**
"
在尋找需要幫助的船時，應該在碼頭周圍做什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **A: 與船員攀談**.

The passage explicitly advises talking to as many people as possible, including crew members in bars. The other options are contradictory to the advice given:

*   **B: 保持低調** goes against the advice to be proactive and talk to people.
*   **C: 僅在人們洗遊艇時接近他們** is too restrictive compared to the advice to approach yacht owners washing their boats, but also to talk to crew members in bars etc.
*   **D: 避免其他搭便船的人** goes against the advice to meet other hitchhikers and share information."
何處會吸引對島上殖民歷史感興趣的遊客？,"The passage states: ""英國殖民者把這裡據為已有，因此如果想在這片土地上尋找殖民歷史的證據，這裡是個不錯的起點。"" and ""香港島的都市發展絕大部份都集中在北部沿岸的海埔新生地上。""

Therefore, the answer is **A: 北部沿岸 (Northern coast)**.
"
何處會吸引優先考慮壯麗景色的遊客？,"The passage states, ""若要欣賞香港最好的景色，你可以離開香港島並前往對岸的九龍海濱。"" This translates to ""To appreciate the best view of Hong Kong, you can leave Hong Kong Island and go to the Kowloon waterfront."" Therefore, the Kowloon waterfront is the best place for tourists prioritizing magnificent views.

The answer is **D: 九龍海濱**
"
有些馬鞍具備什麼東西，有助減少騎士的腳被馬鐙卡住的風險？,"The correct answer is **B: 安全手把**.

The passage states: ""有些馬鞍 (尤其英式馬鞍) 具備安全手把，騎乘者墜馬時往後拉，就可讓馬蹬上的皮帶從馬鞍上脫落。"" This clearly indicates that safety stirrups (手把) help reduce the risk of a rider's foot getting caught.
"
使用馬鐙時，馬靴的哪些功能有助於提高騎士的安全性？,"The correct answer is **C: 鞋跟**

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically mentions that ""大部份的騎士都穿著有鞋跟且鞋底平滑狹窄的馬靴。"" (Most riders wear boots with heels and smooth, narrow soles.) The heel helps prevent the foot from slipping *through* the stirrup. While the narrow sole is also mentioned, the question specifically asks about the function of the *boot* that enhances safety, and the heel is the key feature in that context."
住宿交換網站能為旅客提供什麼服務？,"The correct answer is **A: 與當地房東的住宿**

The passage explicitly states that accommodation exchange websites connect travelers with locals in the cities they want to visit. This implies that these websites provide a way to find accommodation with local hosts.
"
根據這段文字，關於住宿交換網站的說法中，以下何者為非？,"The correct answer is **A: 總會提供旅客當地房東的參考資料**.

Here's why:

* **B: 某些網站可能會要求旅客進行額外驗證:** The passage explicitly states, ""雖然有些網路會提供或需要額外的驗證."" So this is true.
* **C: 會提供旅客目的地城市可供選擇的房東列表:** The passage says, ""可供選擇的房東列表會以紙本或線上方式提供..."" So this is true.
* **D: 有時會提供旅客當地房東的評價:** The passage mentions ""...偶爾還會附有其他旅客留下的推薦和評價."" So this is true.
* **A: 總會提供旅客當地房東的參考資料:** The passage only says that lists of hosts *are* provided, it doesn't say that they *always* are. The use of ""occasionally"" for ratings indicates that some sites might not offer that feature, and it's implied the same could be true for lists of available hosts.

Therefore, option A is incorrect.
"
根據這段文字，哪種類型的房客最不可能在青年旅館宿舍房中找到？,"根據文章內容，最不可能在青年旅館宿舍房中找到的是 **C: 帶小孩旅行的房客**。

理由如下：

*   文章指出「帶著小孩的家庭極為少見」，暗示他們很少會選擇青年旅館。
*   文章也提到「有些青年旅館確實會允許他們入住**私人套房**」，這意味著如果他們入住青年旅館，通常會選擇私人空間，而不是宿舍房。

其他選項：

*   A: 二十出頭的房客 - 文章明確指出這是青年旅館的典型房客。
*   B: 獨自旅行的房客 - 文章並未提及，但青年旅館的社交氛圍通常吸引獨自旅行者。
*   D: 三十多歲的房客 - 文章提到「但也常會在那裡看到年紀較大的旅客」，包括三十多歲的人。

因此，選項 C 是最符合文章內容的答案。
"
根據這段文字，誰最有可能住在青年旅館？,"The correct answer is **B: 三個 22 歲一起旅行的年輕人**.

Here's why:

*   **P** states that the primary customer of a hostel is young people. A group of 22-year-olds fits this description.
*   **A** and **D** are unlikely to stay in a hostel, as the text says that families with children are rare in hostels.
*   **C** is possible, as the text says older travellers are sometimes seen, but young people are more likely."
根據這段文字，關於迴力鏢投擲的描述，以下何者正確？,"正確答案是 **D: 只有部分迴力鏢能夠飛回來**

原文明確指出""大部分澳洲的迴力鏢其實是不會飛回來的""，這意味著只有部分迴力鏢能夠飛回來。

其他選項錯誤的原因：

*   **A: 如果正確投擲，它一定會回到你的手中** - 原文沒有說*所有*迴力鏢只要正確投擲就會回來，只提到要選擇""適合飛回來的迴力鏢""。
*   **B: 比起遊客，它在當地人之間更熱門** - 原文只說遊客想學，沒有比較誰更熱門。
*   **C: 澳洲能買迴力鏢的地方並不多** - 原文沒有提到迴力鏢的購買地點或數量。
"
爪哇美食主要使用以下哪一種調味料？,"The correct answer is **C: 椰子糖**.

The passage specifically mentions ""sugar (especially Javanese palm sugar)"" as a common seasoning. Javanese palm sugar is also known as coconut sugar.
"
根據這段文字，傳染病是如何傳播的？,"The correct answer is **A: 受感染者**.

The passage states: ""傳染病是人在受感染者附近便容易被傳播的疾病"" which translates to ""Contagious diseases are diseases that are easily spread when people are near infected individuals."" This directly indicates that being near an infected person is how contagious diseases spread.
"
根據這段文字，何者並非導致傳染病的原因？,"The correct answer is **A: 疫苗**.

The text states that infectious diseases are caused by pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, or other parasites. Vaccines are used to *prevent* diseases, not cause them.
"
在哪種情況下，對使用者來說，選擇網路代理伺服器而非個人 VPN 供應商就足夠了？,"正確答案是 **C: 使用者主要重新路由 HTTP 流量**

理由如下：

* **前提摘要：** 問題敘述已經清楚表明 VPN 的優勢在於能重新導向「所有」網路流量 (不僅是 HTTP)，提供更高的頻寬、更好的服務品質和更強的加密。

* **選項分析：**

    * **A: 使用者想要重新路由所有流量：** VPN 的強項，而非代理伺服器的優勢。
    * **B: 使用者考慮盡可能避免審查和間諜活動：** VPN 的加密優勢使其更適合這種情況。
    * **C: 使用者主要重新路由 HTTP 流量：** 代理伺服器主要處理 HTTP(S) 流量。 如果使用者的需求僅限於此，則代理伺服器可能就足夠，而不需要 VPN 的所有額外功能（及其潛在的成本和複雜性）。
    * **D: 使用者的活動需要中等到高水平的頻寬：** VPN 通常提供更高的頻寬，因此優於代理伺服器。

因此，當使用者僅需要重新導向 HTTP 流量時，選擇網路代理伺服器而非個人 VPN 供應商可能就足夠了。
"
根據這段文字，關於 VPN 和網路代理伺服器的說法中，以下何者為非？,"The correct answer is **D: VPN 只能重新路由 HTTP 流量**

Here's why:

*   **P clearly states:** ""它們能重新導向**所有網路流量**，而非只有 http 的流量."" This implies that VPNs do *not* only reroute HTTP traffic.
*   **A, B, and C are all supported by the text:**
    *   A: Higher bandwidth is mentioned: ""它們通常會提供**更高的頻寬**與更好的服務品質""
    *   B: Rerouting all traffic versus only HTTP is mentioned: ""它們能重新導向**所有網路流量**，而非只有 http 的流量"" (This implies that network proxies cannot route all network traffic)
    *   C: Better service quality is mentioned: ""它們通常會提供更高的頻寬與**更好的服務品質**"""
何者讓人們可以使用所在地區以外的電話公司？,"The correct answer is **A: 透過網際網路傳訊的通話 (Through internet messaging calls)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that ""由於通話是透過網際網路傳訊的，不需要用到住處或到訪處的電話公司 (Since calls are routed through internet messaging, there's no need to use the phone company of your residence or where you're visiting)."" This directly links internet messaging calls to the ability to bypass local phone companies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 國際電話號碼 (International phone numbers):** While international numbers are mentioned in the context of needing them to receive PSTN calls, they don't *enable* using a phone company outside your area. They are a *consequence* in some situations.
*   **C: 衛星 (Satellite):** The passage mentions satellite internet as a way to get an internet connection in remote areas, but it's the internet connection (and the ability to make calls through it) that matters, not the satellite itself. Satellite alone doesn't allow you to use a different phone company.
*   **D: PSTN 電話 (PSTN phones):** PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) is the traditional phone network, and the passage highlights how internet calls *bypass* the PSTN and its associated geographic limitations.

Therefore, the most accurate and direct answer based on the passage is **A**.
"
根據這段文字，某些電話可能需要做什麼事情才可以接聽？,"The correct answer is **A: 購買國際電話號碼**.

The text states: ""常見的情況是必須購買不同的國際電話號碼，才能接到 PSTN 電話."" (It is common to have to purchase different international phone numbers to receive PSTN calls.)

The other options are incorrect because the text implies the opposite:

*   **B: 使用本地電話公司:** The text says calls ""不需要用到住處或到訪處的電話公司"" (do not require the phone company of your home or place you are visiting).
*   **C: 擁有當地社區的電話號碼:** The text says you ""無需擁有居住社區的當地電話號碼"" (do not need to have a local phone number for the community where you live).
*   **D: 購買 PSTN 手機:** The text does not say you have to buy a PSTN cellphone.
"
關於義大利文單字發音的描述，以下何者不正確？,"The correct answer is **D: 大多數單字的發音會根據其後的母音而定**.

Here's why:

* **P** states specifically that *only* the letters `c` and `g` change pronunciation based on the following vowel. The other options are stated directly by P.

Therefore, option D is the only one that is explicitly incorrect according to the passage.
"
以下哪些伊茲密爾的特色源於現代之前？,"The correct answer is **D: 紅瓦屋頂 (Red-tiled roofs)**.

The passage mentions ""傳統的紅瓦屋頂、18 世紀的市場，以及古老的清真寺和教堂"" which suggests that red-tiled roofs are part of the city's historical/traditional character. The other options (寬闊的林蔭大道, 玻璃帷幕大樓, 購物中心) are described as modern features.
"
關於伊茲密爾的特色，以下何者不正確？,"The correct answer is **B: 能反映傳統土耳其的氛圍 (Reflects a traditional Turkish atmosphere)**.

The passage explicitly states that Izmir has a ""地中海歐洲的氛圍更加濃厚 (more Mediterranean European atmosphere)"" rather than a traditional Turkish one. The other options are all directly supported by the text.
"
「花見」這個詞指的是觀賞什麼事物？,"The correct answer is **A: 櫻花**.

The passage explicitly states that ""賞櫻，又稱為「花見」"" which translates to ""Cherry blossom viewing, also known as 'Hanami'"". Therefore, Hanami refers to viewing cherry blossoms.
"
是誰舉辦了第一次專門賞櫻的派對？,"The correct answer is **C: 日本天皇**

The passage states: ""在日本，最早的櫻花祭是天皇專為自己和皇宮周邊其他貴族所辦的。"" which translates to ""In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing festival was held by the Emperor for himself and other nobles around the Imperial Palace.""
"
根據這段文字，耶路撒冷的以下哪個方面最不可能有觀光吸引力？,"The passage explicitly mentions that Jerusalem is a major tourist attraction due to its religious significance, historical sites, and cultural attractions. It also highlights its vibrancy with shopping centers, cafes, and restaurants.

The fact that most countries don't recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital is a political issue, not a tourist attraction. Tourists are drawn to the city's history, religion, and culture, regardless of its recognized political status.

Therefore, the answer is **B: 它作為以色列首都的地位 (Its status as the capital of Israel)**.
"
文中沒有提到以下何者為耶路撒冷聞名遐邇的原因？,"The correct answer is **B: 政治影響**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 迷人的歷史:** The passage explicitly mentions Jerusalem's ""charming history spanning thousands of years.""
*   **C: 宗教意義:** The passage states that Jerusalem is the holy city for three monotheistic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), making it a significant religious center.
*   **D: 文化遺址:** The passage mentions ""historical, archaeological, and cultural sites.""

While the passage does mention the *fact* of political disagreement regarding Jerusalem's status as Israel's capital, it does not present political influence as a *reason* for Jerusalem's fame. Instead, it emphasizes the historical, religious, and cultural factors.
"
根據這段文字，哪種類型的旅客不會因購買 Wild Card 而受益？,"The correct answer is **B: 只參觀克魯格國家公園的旅客 (Travelers who will only visit Kruger National Park)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage suggests that the Wild Card is beneficial for those visiting multiple parks, either select parks or all of South Africa's national parks. If you are only visiting Kruger, the cost of the Wild Card may not be worth it.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   A: 打算盡可能多參訪幾處南非國家公園的旅客 (Travelers who plan to visit as many South African National Parks as possible) - This is exactly who the Wild Card is designed for.
*   C: 擔心公園費用的窮遊旅客 (Budget travelers concerned about park fees) - The passage implies the Wild Card could save money on entrance fees overall, for visiting multiple parks.
*   D: 打算參觀克魯格國家公園和至少一個其他公園的旅客 (Travelers who plan to visit Kruger National Park and at least one other park) - This implies the Wild Card is likely beneficial because it covers multiple parks."
關於克魯格國家公園的描述，哪種說法不正確？,"The correct answer is **C: 它是南非最小的國家公園 (It is the smallest national park in South Africa)**.

The passage states that Kruger National Park is a ""flagship"" park, implying it's a major and likely large park. It never suggests it's the smallest. The other options are directly supported by the passage.
"
對登山者來說，在整個山坡陡峭部分中，以下何者最有可能造成危險？,"The passage states: ""也要特別小心較陡的部份，尤其是潮濕的時候，因為這可能迅速使情況變得危險。""

This directly links the steep parts of the climb with danger when it's wet. Therefore, the answer is A: 潮濕情況 (Tidal condition).
"
以下哪種說法不能正確表達文中所述的馬丘比丘山的攀登？,"The correct answer is **B: 整個陡峭路段沒有扶手 (The entire steep section has no handrails)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""...地勢陡峭的路段則裝上鋼纜作為扶手 (Steep sections are fitted with steel cables as handrails)."" This directly contradicts option B. The passage says there *are* handrails on the steep sections.
*   The other options are all supported by the passage:
    *   A: ""...要有喘不過氣的心理準備 (Be prepared to be breathless).""
    *   C: ""...有個必須穿越的小洞穴 (There is a small cave to pass through).""
    *   D: ""...也要特別小心較陡的部份，尤其是潮濕的時候，因為這可能迅速使情況變得危險 (Be especially careful on the steeper parts, especially when wet, as this can quickly make the situation dangerous)."""
根據這段文字，何者並非馬略卡島飲食的主食？,"The correct answer is **C: 穀物**.

While bread (made from grains) is a staple, the passage explicitly mentions bread, vegetables, and meat (specifically pork) as the main components of the Mallorca diet. Grains, as a general category, are not explicitly mentioned as a primary focus beyond their use in bread.
"
根據文中資訊，關於地熱土窯美食的說法，何者為非？,"The correct answer is **A: 地熱土窯料理使用火燒過的滾燙石頭加熱坑洞**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""他們會用火燒過的滾燙石頭加熱坑洞，某些地方則有地熱，讓附近的地面變得滾燙。"" This means some use heated rocks while others use geothermal. Option A incorrectly states that *all* geothermal cooking uses heated rocks.
*   The passage indicates that geothermal cooking is possible in locations with geothermically heated ground.
*   The passage states: ""在羅托魯瓦的幾個地方可以吃到地熱土窯料理，而在基督城、威靈頓和其他地方也能品嚐到其他土窯料理。"" This confirms that geothermal cooking can be found in Rotorua and other methods can be found in other cities.
*   The passage states: ""土窯常用於烹煮傳統烘烤式的晚餐。"" This states that the meals are similar and often the same.
"
典型的地熱土窯加熱方法中並未提及以下何者？,"The correct answer is **A: 天然氣**.

The passage mentions:

*   **滾燙石頭 (滾燙石頭)**: Used to heat the pit.
*   **地熱 (地熱)**: Naturally heats the ground in some areas.
*   **滾燙石頭 (滾燙石頭)**: Redundant, but mentioned.

天然氣 is not mentioned as a heating method.
"
什麼可能會引起僧侶或尼姑的特別認可？,"The correct answer is **A: 穿著色彩鮮豔的裹巾 (Wearing a brightly colored wrap)**.

The passage states ""...but if you bring your own (particularly one in a bright color), the monk or nun at the entrance will smile approvingly."" This directly indicates that bringing a brightly colored wrap would elicit a smile of approval.
"
從寺院不太可能借用以下哪件衣服？ ,"The correct answer is **B: 短褲 (Shorts)**.

Here's why:

*   The text says women need skirts or wraps and men need long pants.
*   The text mentions borrowing wraps, skirts, and pants from the monastery.
*   The text does *not* mention borrowing shorts. Therefore, it's unlikely you could borrow shorts from the monastery."
造訪南極地區時，遊客何時有機會看到星星？,"根據原文，在冬季造訪南極地區，天空幾乎整天都是黑的，提供了觀賞星星的機會。因此，答案是 **C: 冬季**。
"
衛星電話何時作為手機的替代品是行不通的？,"根據文章內容，衛星電話無法替代手機的原因是**您必須在戶外且對準衛星才能撥打電話**。 這意味著如果衛星的視線受阻，衛星電話就無法使用。

因此，正確答案是：

**A: 如果衛星的視線可能受阻**
"
何時衛星電話比手機更妥當？,"正確答案是 **B: 在划船旅行期間**。

理由：

* **文章指出：**「船舶（包括遊樂船和有遠端資料與音訊需求的探險船）時常使用這項服務。」划船旅行屬於船舶的一種應用情境。
* **文章指出：**「在手機訊號到不了的偏遠地區，您可能只能選用衛星電話。」划船旅行，特別是遠洋航行，常常會遠離陸地基地台，導致手機沒有訊號。

其他選項錯誤的原因：

* **A: 在城市度假時：** 城市通常有良好的手機訊號覆蓋，不需要衛星電話。
* **C: 不需要遠端資料時：** 文章提到探險船需要遠端資料與音訊傳輸，暗示衛星電話能夠提供這些服務，與此選項描述的情況相反。
* **D: 您可能有合乎需要的手機訊號時：** 如果有手機訊號，就不需要使用衛星電話。
"
以下哪一項衝突促成了聶斯特河沿岸共和國的成立？,"The correct answer is **B: 種族**.

The passage states that Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic ""beset by ethnic conflict problems,"" and that ""this conflict"" led to the formation of Transnistria. This directly links the formation of the breakaway republic to ethnic tensions.
"
聶斯特河沿岸共和國擁有以下何者與摩爾多瓦其他地區不同？  ,"The correct answer is **C: 聯合國的承認** and **D: 貨幣**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (聶斯特河沿岸共和國) has its own currency and is not recognized by any UN member state.
*   The passage does not mention any difference in language or religion.

"
根據這段文字，如果旅客希望避免大風的情況，他們應該何時到訪蒙特維多？,"正確答案是 **C: 北半球的夏季月份**

理由如下：

*   這段文字指出蒙特維多的冬季伴隨著強風，且風加上濕度會讓人感覺更冷。
*   蒙特維多的冬季發生在北半球的夏季月份。

因此，為了避免大風，旅客應該選擇在北半球的夏季月份前往蒙特維多。"
根據這段文字，如果旅客偏愛涼爽的氣候，他們應該何時到訪蒙特維多？,"The correct answer is **B: 北半球的夏季**. Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""由於蒙特維多位於赤道以南，因此當北半球冬季時，那裡是夏季，反之亦然 (Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice-versa)."" This means that when it's summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it's winter in Montevideo.
* **The passage also states:** ""那裡的冬天寒意有時會騙人，因為氣溫很少低於零下，但風加上濕度，讓人感覺比溫度計上顯示的冷多了 (The winter there is sometimes deceptively chilly because temperatures rarely fall below zero, but the wind combined with humidity makes it feel much colder than the thermometer shows).""

Because the Northern Hemisphere's summer corresponds to Montevideo's winter, and the passage suggests that Montevideo's winters are cool, the best time for a traveler who prefers cool weather to visit Montevideo is during the Northern Hemisphere's summer.
"
根據這段文字，以下何者與知名的塗鴉藝術家有關，而不是蓄意破壞？,"The correct answer is **A: 塗鴉活動 (Graffiti events)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage contrasts graffiti as vandalism (e.g., ""年輕人用噴漆破壞公共或私人財產"") with graffiti as art (""現今已有很多知名的塗鴉藝術家、塗鴉活動和「合法」塗鴉牆。這類的塗鴉繪畫通常類似於藝術品"").
*   塗鴉活動 (Graffiti events) are explicitly linked to the positive, artistic side of graffiti.
*   The other options (潦草字跡, 擅自在公共財產上加上的壁畫, 難以辨別的標誌) are all associated with the vandalism aspect of graffiti."
部分參加音樂節的遊客認為音樂節哪些方面是體驗的重要環節？,"The correct answer is **B: 現場露營**.

The passage states: ""在某些節慶中，參加音樂節的大部分遊客都會選擇在現場露營，而且他們大多認為這是體驗的重要環節。"" (In some festivals, most tourists who attend music festivals choose to camp on-site, and they mostly consider it an important part of the experience.)

The other options are mentioned in the passage, but not specifically highlighted as an important part of the overall *experience* for most festival-goers:

*   **A: 帶上幼童 (Bringing young children)**: The passage mentions that some festivals provide designated camping areas for families with young children, but it doesn't say bringing children is an important part of the *experience* for most people.
*   **C: 持續到深夜的音樂表演 (Music performances lasting until late at night)**: While mentioned as a possibility, it's not highlighted as essential to the overall festival experience.
*   **D: 提早進場 (Arriving early)**: This is mentioned as necessary to get a good camping spot, but not as intrinsically important to the overall experience itself."
根據這段文字，如果參加音樂節的遊客想在音樂附近露營，他們應該優先考慮什麼？,"正確答案是 **D: 提早進場**。

文本中明確指出：「如果你想近距離觀賞活動，你必須提早進去，找到一個靠近音樂演奏的露營地點。」 其他選項則與在音樂附近露營無關。
"
根據這段文字，在新墨西哥州北部尋找夜生活時，遊客應該避開哪裡？,"The passage states: ""this author reminds you that the small town bars aren't always the places to be, for out-of-state travelers. One reason is that Northern New Mexico has serious issues with drunk driving, and this is more common around the small town bars.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: 小鎮酒吧**.
"
根據這段文字，在新墨西哥州北部，遊客最有可能在哪裡找到知名娛樂場所？,"The correct answer is **C: 聖塔菲附近的賭場**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that ""the casinos listed above almost all have drinks, and some even bring in big-name entertainment (mostly the larger casinos near Albuquerque and Santa Fe)."" This directly supports that casinos near Santa Fe are likely places to find big-name entertainment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 距離阿布奎基兩小時車程的賭場:** While casinos near Albuquerque are mentioned, the answer C is more appropriate as the passage specifies ""聖塔菲周遭鄰近的較大賭場"" (Larger casinos near Santa Fe)
*   **B: 一個偏遠小鎮:** The passage states that most Indian villages are remote, and there isn't much nightlife unless you go to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
*   **D: 小鎮酒吧:** The passage warns tourists *against* frequenting small-town bars due to potential safety concerns related to drunk driving."
精打細算的旅客可能想避開哪種類型的飲料？,"The passage states that ""果汁很貴，但非常好喝"" (Juice is expensive, but very delicious). Therefore, the answer is **D: 果汁**.
"
根據文中所述的區域，服務生可能會弄混以下哪張飲料訂單？,"The correct answer is **D: 白咖啡**.

Here's why:

*   The text states ""對澳洲人來說，「白咖啡」是外來的點子."" This implies that in the described area (likely Australia or a region influenced by Australian culture), the concept of ""white coffee"" might not be well understood or recognized. Therefore, a waiter might be confused by this order.
*   The other options are either explicitly mentioned as being available (""第一"", ""紐西蘭的白蘇維濃""), or are described with local variations (""濃縮咖啡"")."
長達三個世紀的殖民時期是由哪個群體開始的？,"The correct answer is **D: 西班牙人**.

The passage states that ""西班牙人开始了长达三个世纪的殖民时期"" (Spaniards began a three-century long colonial period).
"
根據這段文字，讓巴黎人對你感興趣的最佳方式是什麼？,"The passage explicitly states: ""If you display basic politeness, the apparent rudeness of Parisians will quickly disappear."" Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: 舉止有禮貌 (舉止有禮貌)**
"
根據這段文字，以下何者不被認為是巴黎人的刻板印象？,"正確答案是 **C: 俏皮**

根據這段文字，巴黎人的刻板印象包含：

*   自我中心
*   無禮
*   自大
*   唐突 (等同於粗率無禮)

俏皮不在這些刻板印象之中，因此答案為 C。
"
開普敦 MetroRail 通勤鐵路頭等艙有什麼好處？,"正確答案是 **B: 人沒有那麼多**

基於提供的段落，我們知道：

*   MetroPlus (頭等艙) 比 Metro (三等艙) 更舒適且較不擁擠。
*   MetroPlus 車廂在靠近開普敦方向的列車尾端，所以 A 不正確。
*   MetroPlus 票價稍貴一些，所以 C 和 D 都不正確。"
根據這段文字，開普敦的每班通勤列車都有什麼？,"正確答案是 **D: 頭等艙和三等艙車廂**

以下解釋為何其他選項不正確：

*   **A: 較不擁擠的三等艙車廂** - 文章提到的是頭等艙 (MetroPlus) 較不擁擠，三等艙 (Metro) 通常比較擁擠。
*   **B: 兩種艙等的票價相同** - 文章明確指出 MetroPlus（頭等艙）的票價比 Metro（三等艙）稍貴。
*   **C: 不同的三種艙等** - 文章只提到兩種艙等：MetroPlus (頭等艙) 和 Metro (三等艙)。"
動物害蟲不太可能做到以下何者？,"正確答案是 **D: 造成藉力傷害**

原因是:

* **P**段落明確指出「藉力傷害或殺害人的危險動物，通常不屬於害蟲」。因此，造成藉力傷害並不是動物害蟲會做的事情。
* **A、B、C**都符合**P**段落中提到動物害蟲可能造成的危害。

所以，**D**是唯一一個不符合**P**段落描述的選項。
"
哪裡可以購買預付電話卡？,"The correct answer is **C: 雜貨店**.

The passage explicitly states: ""每一間雜貨店都有販售預付電話卡..."" (Every grocery store sells prepaid phone cards...).
"
如何取得通話費率更優惠的某些預付卡？,"The correct answer is **B: 透過撥打免付費電話**.

The passage states: ""通常可以透過撥打一支免付費電話號碼來取得這些服務..."". This implies that calling a toll-free number will provide information about the discounted rates for specific countries.
"
根據這段文字，在十六湖國家公園不太常見到以下哪棵樹？,"答案是 B: 橡樹。

文本中明确提到十六湖国家公园以山毛榉、云杉和枞树为主，所以这些树木在那里很常见。文本中没有提到橡树。
"
以下哪些稀有動物可以在十六湖國家公園找到？,"The correct answer is **D: 松雞**

The passage explicitly mentions ""松雞"" (Grouse) as one of the rare animals found in Plitvice Lakes National Park. The other options are not mentioned.
"
根據這段文字，區域碼實際上能幫助什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 掌控市場**.

The passage explicitly states: ""實際目的是讓公司更能掌控他們的市場; 一切都是為了賺錢."" (The actual purpose is to allow companies to better control their markets; it's all about making money.)  It also states that regional codes *don't* prevent piracy.
"
根據這段文字，以下何者是媒體公司以區域碼繼續編造的謊言？,"正確答案是 **B: 區域碼有助於避免非法複製**

理由如下：

*   **P 敘述的主要論點：** 媒體公司謊稱區域碼的目的是「防止盜版」，但實際上並非如此。
*   **選項分析：**
    *   A: 區域碼是更能掌控他們市場的必要措施 - 這不是謊言，而是作者認為的**真正目的**。
    *   B: 區域碼有助於避免非法複製 - 這就是媒體公司聲稱的目的，但作者認為是**謊言**。
    *   C: 區域碼對吸金很有用 - 雖然作者說區域碼的目的是為了賺錢，但這並非媒體公司公開宣稱的理由。
    *   D: 區域碼對防止盜版幾乎沒有幫助 - 這符合作者的觀點，但並非媒體公司所聲稱的。

因此，只有選項 B 準確地反映了媒體公司捏造的謊言。
"
回國時，何者通常是非正規程序？,"The correct answer is **A: 移民署檢查**.

The passage states: ""回國時，可能不必經過移民署檢查，或僅是例行公事,..."" This implies that immigration checks might be skipped or just a formality, making them potentially irregular. The passage emphasizes the importance of customs regulations and declarations, suggesting they are the standard and expected process.
"
回國時，您應該瞭解以下何者？,"The best answer is **D: 是否攜帶任何違禁品**. Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes knowing what you can and cannot bring.** It directly states ""一定要知道可攜帶及不可攜帶的物品種類.""  违禁品 (contraband) falls squarely within the ""不可攜帶"" category.

Let's look at why the other options are less ideal:

* **A: 是否有移民署檢查站 (Whether there is an immigration checkpoint):** The passage says immigration checks might be minimal (""可能不必經過移民署檢查，或僅是例行公事""). While useful to know, it's not the *most* important takeaway.
* **B: 是否需要申報超出法律規定的物品 (Whether you need to declare items exceeding legal limits):**  This is important, but it's a *consequence* of knowing the rules about what you can bring. The passage highlights knowing the *types* of items and then understanding the declaration requirements if you exceed limits (""若攜帶超出規定數量必須詳實申報"").
* **C: 是否有海關管制 (Whether there are customs controls):** The passage mentions customs control can be bothersome (""海關控管就可能十分惱人""), but the core message is about *understanding the rules* of customs, specifically what you can and cannot bring.

Therefore, understanding whether you're carrying any prohibited items is the most direct and crucial point you should understand when returning home, based on the given passage.
"
根據這段文字，科查莫谷具備豐富的什麼東西讓登山者不斷探索其內部的新路線？,"The correct answer is **D: 岩壁**.

The passage explicitly states that ""世界各地的攀岩者持續在潛力無窮的**岩壁**上開創新的路線 (Climbers from around the world continue to open new routes on the rocks of infinite potential)"". While the other options are mentioned, the text directly links the creation of new routes to the abundance and potential of the rock faces (岩壁).
"
根據文中提供的資訊，誰涵蓋了南半球最多的越洋航線？,"根據文章內容：

*   **星空聯盟**涵蓋了南半球幾乎所有航線，只缺少聖地牙哥到大溪地這一段。
*   **天合聯盟**沒有橫跨任何海洋。
*   **寰宇一家**只提到他們營運聖地牙哥到大溪地的航線。

所以，**星空聯盟**涵蓋了南半球最多的越洋航線。

因此答案是：**B: 星空聯盟**
"
哪個航空聯盟涵蓋最少的南半球越洋航線？,"根據文章內容，天合聯盟未橫跨任一海洋，因此涵蓋最少的南半球越洋航線。

所以答案是 **D: 天合聯盟**。
"
哪個旅遊組織接續了全球跑步之旅？,"The correct answer is **B: Go Running Tours**.

The passage states: ""Go Running Tours 接續 Global Running Tours 成立..."" which translates to ""Go Running Tours was established following Global Running Tours..."".
"
根據這段文字，Go Running Tours 協助串連了多少個不同的觀光路跑供應商？,"The correct answer is **C: 數十個** (數十個 means ""dozens"" which is consistent with the text).
"
如果遊客希望盡可能清楚地看到獵豹，該怎麼做？,"The passage states: ""獅子、獵豹和花豹有時會害怕人靠近，比較適合用雙筒望遠鏡來觀察."" This means that to see cheetahs clearly, binoculars are the best option.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 使用雙筒望遠鏡**
"
根據這段文字，遊客在坐車遊覽野生動物園時可能會遇到哪種動物？,"The correct answer is **B: 長頸鹿**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""大象和長頸鹿這些動物往往會接近車子..."" (Elephants and giraffes often approach the vehicles...) This indicates giraffes are likely to be encountered when traveling by vehicle.
* The passage also states: 獅子、獵豹和花豹有時會害怕人靠近，比較適合用雙筒望遠鏡來觀察。(Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes afraid of people approaching and are better observed with binoculars.) This indicates they are less likely to approach the vehicle directly.
"
根據這段文字，什麼事情會降低旅遊成本？,"The correct answer is **D: 尋找六人或六人以上的團體**.

The passage states ""越多人的旅行團價格越便宜"", which directly translates to ""the more people in the tour group, the cheaper the price."" Therefore, the larger the group you join (ideally a group of six or more, as suggested), the lower your individual cost.
"
根據這段文字，誰有可能獲得最棒的旅遊價格？,"The passage states that larger groups get cheaper prices and mentions forming groups of 4-6. Option D, a five-person group, fits that description and is therefore likely to get a better price than smaller groups. The passage also implies that joining a tour by yourself might not be the best deal due to the nature of how the tours are organized.

Therefore, the best answer is:

**D: 五人團**
"
根據這段文字，是什麼讓舊金山得以聞名全球？,"The correct answer is **A: 經常出現在各種形式的藝術和媒體中**.

The text states: ""音樂、電影、文學和流行文化中的頻繁描述使這座城市及其地標變得舉世聞名."" This directly supports option A. While the other options are mentioned in the text, they are not explicitly stated as the reason for San Francisco's global fame.
"
根據這段文字，關於舊金山的說法中，以下何者為非？,"The correct answer is **D: 經濟完全仰仗旅遊業**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that while tourism is important, San Francisco's economy is ""very diverse"" and lists other major sectors like professional services, government, finance, and trade. This directly contradicts the idea that the economy relies *solely* on tourism.

The other options are all supported by the text:

*   **A: 它經常出現在電影和書籍中** - The passage says ""frequent depictions in music, film, literature and popular culture""
*   **B: 亞洲美食很普遍** - The passage mentions being ""one of the best places in the country for Korean, Thai, Indian, and Japanese, among other Asian cuisines.""
*   **C: 有許多飯店和會議中心** - The passage mentions ""a large tourism infrastructure including countless hotels, restaurants, and world-class convention facilities."""
根據這段文字，哪種類型的旅客不太可能因使用旅行社服務而受益？,"The passage highlights several benefits of using travel agencies, including:

*   **Peace of mind from pre-booked accommodation:** Useful for planners.
*   **Variety of accommodation options:** Though they partner with hotels, they can book campsites too.
*   **Package deals:** Combining flights, hotels, meals, and transportation, attractive to those who like bundled services.
*   **Reservation holds:** Helpful for those needing time to consider or gather documents like visas.
*   **Acting as a point of contact:** If there are issues.

Considering these advantages, the type of traveler least likely to benefit from a travel agency is:

*   **B: Tendency to make spontaneous plans:** Travel agencies excel at pre-arranged bookings. Someone who prefers to go with the flow and decide on accommodation and activities on the spur of the moment would find the structured approach of a travel agency restrictive.

Therefore, the answer is **B**."
文中沒有提到以下何者為經由旅行社預訂的好處？,"The correct answer is **A: 旅行證件急件處理 (Expedited processing of travel documents)**.

Here's why:

*   **B: 飯店優惠 (Hotel discounts):** The passage mentions that travel agencies often partner with specific hotels. While not explicitly stated, it implies potential for preferential rates or deals due to this partnership.
*   **C: 全包套裝行程 (All-inclusive packages):** The passage states that travel agencies offer packages that may include breakfast, airport transfers, and even bundles with flights and hotels. These are essentially all-inclusive options.
*   **D: 保留預訂 (Hold reservations):** The passage directly states that travel agencies can hold reservations while you consider proposals or gather necessary documents.

The passage does **not** mention anything about expedited processing of travel documents like visas. It only mentions the *need* to gather documents like visas, but not that the agency can expedite their acquisition.
"
根據這段文字，即時文本翻譯應用程式不能做什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 每次都 100% 正確翻譯**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that translations are not always perfect and that users should exercise caution. It says ""...because the translation results may still be completely wrong..."" This implies that 100% accuracy is not guaranteed.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: 將標誌翻譯成外語:** The passage mentions translating real-world signs or objects.
*   **B: 翻譯整段文本:** The passage defines the app as one that ""automatically translates entire pieces of text from one language to another.""
*   **C: 透過智慧型手機翻譯物件上的文本:** The passage specifically mentions that some apps can translate foreign writing on signs or other objects by pointing a smartphone at them.
"
何者讓翻譯可以離線進行？,"The correct answer is **C: 下載語言資料**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...Google 翻譯, 它可以在下載所需的語言資料後，進行離線翻譯.""
"
以下何者並非觸發雪崩的因素？,"正確答案是 **A: 有黏性的雪**

理由：

*   文章中明確指出「雪有黏性，因此需要一些契機才會滑落」，說明雪的黏性是阻礙雪崩發生的因素，而不是觸發因素。
*   文章中也提到「原初的觸發事件有時是太陽使雪升溫，有時是下了更多雪，有時是其它自然事件，但更常是人為」，說明陽光(C)、額外降雪(D)和人類(B)都可能觸發雪崩。"
根據這段文字，以下何者掉下會形成雪崩？,"The correct answer is **C: 陡坡上多餘的積雪 (Steep slopes with excessive snow)**.

Here's why:

*   **P explicitly states:** ""...陡峭斜坡能累積的雪量有限，多餘的積雪會掉下形成雪崩 (Steep slopes can only accumulate a limited amount of snow, and the excess snow will fall and form an avalanche).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 未觸發的有黏性的雪 (Untriggered sticky snow)**: While the text mentions the stickiness of snow, it also says a trigger is needed. Untriggered snow doesn't cause an avalanche *until* something sets it off.
*   **B: 沒有雪的陡峭斜坡 (Steep slopes with no snow)**: An avalanche requires snow.
*   **D: 人類沒碰過的雪 (Snow untouched by humans)**: The text says that avalanches are often caused by humans, but they can also be caused by nature, so snow doesn't have to be touched by humans to be a part of an avalanche.
"
根據這段文字，咖哩以哪些食材為底？,"The correct answer is **B: 藥草和香料**.

The passage states: ""咖哩是以藥草和香料為底，加上肉類或蔬菜的菜餚。"" (Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, with meat or vegetables added.)
"
在某些地區，有時咖哩中的哪種食材會使用椰奶代替？,"正確答案是 **C: 優格**。

根據文章內容：「巴基斯坦和北印度內陸區的咖哩料理中常用到優格；南印度和印度次大陸的其他沿海地區則常改用椰奶。」 明確指出某些地區會用椰奶代替優格。
"
為什麼沿著橫貫南極山脈繞彎路才能抵達高原上方？,"The correct answer is **C: 專用拖拉機不靈活**.

The passage states: ""它們不太靈活，所以路徑必須沿著橫貫南極山脈繞著長長的彎路才能抵達高原上方"" (They are not very maneuverable, so the route must take long detours around the Transantarctic Mountains to reach the plateau above.) This directly links the inflexibility of the tractors to the need for a winding route.
"
在南極橫貫公路上，什麼東西用旗幟作記號了？,"The correct answer is **C: 用雪填補過的裂縫**.

The passage states: ""It is compacted snow and crevasses are filled and marked with flags."" This means the crevasses (裂縫) filled with snow are marked with flags.
"
文中沒有提到遊客在探索南非時應該注意什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 幾乎所有南非鄰國都很穩定**.

The passage states ""...南非雖然安定，但並非所有鄰國都如此."" This directly contradicts option C, making it the thing tourists *should* be aware of, but the passage doesn't explicitly mention it as something tourists *should* be aware of when exploring South Africa. It just says that not all of the surrounding countries are stable.

The other options are directly supported by the passage:
*   A: ""各國的簽證要求和費用不盡相同，也會跟所屬國家或地區有關。""
*   B: ""開車進入南部非洲是一種很好的方式，能看見該地區的所有美景，也能到達一般旅遊路線以外的地方。""
*   D: ""強烈建議選擇四輪傳動車，而且許多地點只有高軸距的四輪傳動車才能抵達。"""
根據這段文字，對於希望駕車探索南非的遊客來說，何者會被視為不好的建議？,"The answer is **B: 雖然建議使用四輪傳動車，但大多數地點都可以用普通車輛到達**

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states that **many** locations are only accessible by high-clearance 4x4 vehicles. Option B says **most** locations are accessible by regular vehicles, which contradicts the text.

The other options are supported by the text:

*   A: The text says ""Each country also has its own laws concerning what emergency items must be carried in a vehicle"".
*   C: The text explicitly states that driving is a great way to ""get to places outside of the normal tourist routes.""
*   D: The text states that ""South Africa is stable, but not all neighboring countries are."""
文中沒有提到以下何者為行李無人看管的潛在危險？,"The correct answer is **C: 可能會與別人的行李混淆 (Might be confused with someone else's luggage)**.

The passage explicitly mentions the following dangers of unattended luggage:

*   **A: 行李可能被盜 (Luggage might be stolen)**
*   **B: 您可能會在不知不覺中成為攜帶毒品者 (You might unknowingly become a drug carrier)**
*   **D: 當局可能會將其視為可能的炸彈威脅 (Authorities might view it as a potential bomb threat)**

The passage does not mention the possibility of the luggage being confused with someone else's.
"
關於攜帶毒品，文中沒有提到什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 即使沒有攜帶毒品，當局也可能會沒收您的行李**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 在部分國家，初犯者可能遭判處死刑:** The passage explicitly states, ""有些國家就算對初犯也有嚴重的刑罰，包含 10 年以上徒刑或死刑.""

*   **B: 國際旅行時應採取額外的預防措施:** The passage starts by advising caution when entering or leaving a country, so this is accurate.

*   **C: 緝毒犬可在不另行通知的情況下查驗:** The passage directly mentions, ""緝毒犬可以在不另行通知的情況下，隨時查驗.""

*   **D: 即使沒有攜帶毒品，當局也可能會沒收您的行李:** While the passage mentions unattended bags being a target for thieves and attracting attention due to bomb threats, it *doesn't* say authorities will confiscate your luggage *simply* because you don't have drugs. The confiscation would happen because of suspicion related to the bag being unattended.
"
居家度假時，文中沒有提到哪種飲料可以嘗試在家製作？,"The correct answer is **C: 啤酒**

The passage mentions:

*   **果汁 (A)**: ""把握機會榨果汁或打一些果昔""
*   **咖啡 (B)**: ""早晨讓家裡充盈濃郁的咖啡香""
*   **茶 (D)**: ""夜間則來點放鬆身心的洋甘菊茶""

啤酒 is the only option not mentioned as a drink to try making at home.
"
如果你的城市以飲酒文化聞名，你應該於居家度假期間到訪以下何者？,"The correct answer is **C: 你通常不常光顧的酒吧 (You usually don't frequent bars)**.

The passage states: ""如果你生活在一個具有各種飲酒文化的城市裡，你應該去周遭平常不太去的酒吧或酒館 (If you live in a city with a drinking culture, you should go to bars or pubs around you that you don't usually go to)."" This directly addresses the question.
"
鴿子雕像在哪裡？,"The correct answer is **B: 墓地裡**.

The passage states ""在教堂的院落中，一些墓碑上有一些有趣的鴿子大理石雕像,"" which translates to ""In the churchyard, some tombstones have interesting marble statues of doves."" Therefore, the dove statues are in the churchyard, which is a cemetery.
"
哪種類型的簽證可能需要某人提供足夠的財力證明？,"The correct answer is **D: 學生簽證**.

The passage explicitly states: ""在大部分的國家/地區，您都要提供欲就讀的教育機構所給的錄取通知書，同時也要提供至少能支持您完成第一年課程的財力證明"" when discussing student visas. The passage doesn't mention financial proof requirements for the other visa types.
"
誰最有可能需要延長簽證？,"The correct answer is **C: 國際學生 (International students)**.

The passage explicitly states that international students typically stay longer than tourists and need student visas, which have different requirements than tourist or business visas. The passage also infers that because International students are planning to stay for longer and pursue a degree, they are the most likely to require an extended visa to complete their studies.
"
何時應該特別注意蚊子？,"The correct answer is **C: 熱帶雨林中** (Tropical Rainforest).

While the passage mentions summer (A) and driving (D), the *context* makes it clear that the primary condition for increased mosquito risk is being in the rainforest.  Hiking (B) is also relevant but specifically mentioned in the context of the rainforest.

Therefore, C is the most comprehensive and accurate answer.
"
根據這段文字，開車穿越熱帶雨林時，為了避開蚊子，你不應該做什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **A: 讓車門打開的時間過長 (Let the car door open for too long)**.

The passage explicitly states that even a few seconds of having the car door open is enough time for mosquitoes to get inside. Therefore, keeping the car door open for an extended period increases the chance of mosquitoes entering the vehicle.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **B: 夏季開車穿越熱帶雨林 (Driving through a tropical rainforest in summer):** The passage mentions summer and rainforests in the context of mosquitoes, but doesn't explicitly state that you shouldn't do this. It's more about being cautious.
*   **C: 駕車穿越亞熱帶地區 (Driving through subtropical regions):** The passage mentions subtropical rainforests as the environment where mosquitoes enter the car when the door is opened. This is not something to avoid.
*   **D: 徒步旅行時無人看管車輛 (Leaving the vehicle unattended while hiking):** The passage discusses hiking separately from driving. It focuses on precautions when driving.

Therefore, the answer is A."
根據這段文字，關於蘇達班的說法中，以下何者為非？,"The correct answer is **B: 其總面積的一半為沼澤所覆蓋 (Its total area is half covered by swamps)**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 它的特色就是坐擁罕見的巨大叢林 (Its characteristic is possessing rare giant jungles)** - The passage states, ""This forest is not only mangrove swamp, but also contains a portion of the giant jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain, of which little now remains."" This supports option A.
*   **C: 它是世界上最大的紅樹林帶 (It is the largest mangrove forest belt in the world)** - The passage states, ""Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world..."" This supports option C.
*   **D: 居住在此的梅花鹿比孟加拉虎更多 (More spotted deer live here than Bengal tigers)** - The passage estimates 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer. This supports option D.
*   **B: 其總面積的一半為沼澤所覆蓋 (Its total area is half covered by swamps)** - The passage states, ""Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, of which about a third is water or swamp."" This means about a third is covered in water or swamp, not half.

Therefore, option B is the only statement that is NOT supported by the passage."
哪一部分的森林位於印度境內？,"The correct answer is **A: 巽達班斯國家公園**.

The passage states: ""位於印度境內的區域稱為巽達班斯國家公園 (The area located in India is called Sundarbans National Park).""
"
根據這段文字，誰最有可能至少稍微理解英文？,"The passage states: ""能稍微理解英語的國家更多，特別是這些國家的年輕人.""

Therefore, the most likely to understand English is:

*   **B: 年紀較小的人 (Younger people)**

So the answer is B."
根據這段文字，什麼東西很難發音？,"The correct answer is **B: 地址**.

The passage states: ""此外，書面字詞通常比口語字詞容易理解，尤其是傳達地址時，因為地址通常很難清楚地發音。"" This directly indicates that addresses are difficult to pronounce clearly.
"
根據這段文字，對於打算從區間巴士站搭巴士的旅客來說，何者是理想情況？,"Let's analyze each option based on the text:

*   **A: 旅客要前往賈卡爾，並已經先買好了車票** - The text says buses to Jakar/Bumthang leave mostly between 06:30 and 07:30, and that it's recommended to buy tickets in advance due to buses filling up. Therefore, someone going to Jakar *with* a pre-purchased ticket is in an ideal situation.

*   **B: 旅客要前往布姆唐，並需要在 7 點之前離開** - Buses to Bumthang leave mostly between 06:30 and 07:30, which means arriving at 7am wouldn't guarantee a spot, and they'd likely miss the majority of the buses.

*   **C: 旅客要前往帕羅，並需要在 11 點之後離開** - The text mentions shared taxis to Paro, and doesn't mention buses at all. Therefore, the time of day they leave has no impact on the bus schedule.

*   **D: 旅客要前往東方，並要在 6:20 之前到達車站** - Buses to the East leave mostly between 06:30 and 07:30. Arriving at 6:20 might be early enough to secure a ticket, but isn't guaranteed to be ideal, as there might be many other passengers waiting.

Therefore, the best answer is **A**."
對於希望從區間巴士站往東方旅行的遊客來說，何者是好秘訣？,"The correct answer is **B: 購買預售票 (Purchase tickets in advance)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Since the interstate buses fill up regularly, it is advisable to buy your tickets a few days in advance.""
*   The other options are incorrect based on the text."
關於廷布克圖的描述，以下何者不正確？,"The correct answer is **C: 搭飛機無法抵達這座城鎮 (It is not possible to reach this town by plane)**.

The passage explicitly states that Timbuktu ""有一座機場 (has an airport)"". The other options are all supported by the text.
"
關於廷布克圖的事實，以下何者為真？,"The correct answer is **A: 搭飛機可以到達這座城鎮** (You can reach the town by plane).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states ""...過往名聲讓其成為旅遊景點，且有一座機場."" (Its past fame makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport).

Let's look at the other options:

*   **B: 比起貧窮，它更具有異國情調 (It is more exotic than poor)**: The passage states it is ""一座貧困的城鎮 (a poor town)"".
*   **C: 與周邊城市相比，它較不具有非洲風情 (It is less African than the surrounding cities)**: The passage states ""該城市與國內的其它城市有明顯差異，因為它偏向擁有阿拉伯而不是非洲風格 (The city is distinctly different from other cities in the country because it tends to have an Arab rather than African style)"".
*   **D: 這座城市不再吸引遊客 (The city no longer attracts tourists)**: The passage states ""...過往名聲讓其成為旅遊景點 (Its past fame makes it a tourist attraction)""."
夏季奧運會原定何時舉行？ ,"The correct answer is **D: 2020 年 7 月**.

The passage states: ""三月底後大多數因新冠病毒所設的取消政策並沒有延長到 2020 年七月，亦即原定舉辦奧運的日期."" This clearly indicates that the original date for the Olympics was July 2020.
"
根據這段文字，何時漏斗會變成龍捲風？,"The correct answer is **D: 接觸地面時 (Contacting the ground)**.

The passage explicitly states that a funnel becomes a tornado ""when it touches the ground.""
"
關於龍捲風的特徵，以下何者正確？,"基於文章 P：

* **A: 一定會產生每小時 100-200 英里左右的風速** - 文章說龍捲風""通常""會產生 100-200 英里/小時的風速，並非""一定""。所以不完全正確。
* **B: 經常帶著重物移動** - 文章說龍捲風""可以""將重物抬舉至空中，表示有此能力。更重要的是，文章說它會把周圍的空氣往內、往上吸，因此被吸入的重物會跟著移動，可以推論此現象常發生。
* **C: 在接觸地面後會變成漏斗** - 文章說它們開始時是漏斗，接觸地面後成為龍捲風。敘述顛倒。
* **D: 是一個會把空氣向外推的旋轉空氣柱** - 文章說龍捲風是把空氣往內、往上吸，不是往外推。

因此，最符合文章描述的答案是 **B: 經常帶著重物移動**。
"
根據這段文字，旅客應該自何處取得有關目的地城市政局的建議？,"The correct answer is **D: 他們自己的政府**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Besides doing your own research, you may also want to consult your government's advice, *though* their advice is designed for their citizens."" This indicates that consulting their own government is a source of information.

The other options are incorrect:

*   A: While the passage mentions consulting the government of the destination country, it immediately points out that their advice is for their own citizens, implying it might not be as relevant.
*   B: The passage says travel advisories offer a ""brief summary,"" which is ""coarse, general, and oversimplified."" This means they are not a source for specific information on the political situation.
*   C: The passage mentions the plight of different nationals in the Middle East and therefore implies that consulting the government of one's own nation is critical when dealing with volatile political situations in foreign territories."
如果有旅遊公告，外國公民不太可能經歷什麼事情？,"根據文章內容，外國公民**不太可能**經歷的是：

*   **D: 關於該國政局的詳情**

文章明確指出，政府提供的諮詢意見通常是「粗略、籠統且過於簡化」的，因此不太可能提供詳細資訊。

其他選項都是可能發生的情況：

*   A: 受影響的行程取消保險（文章提到旅遊建議會影響）
*   B: 過度簡化該國政局的概況（文章提到政府諮詢意見通常是過於簡化的）
*   C: 受影響的健康保險（文章提到旅遊建議會影響）

因此，正確答案是 **D**。
"
根據這段文字，哪種類型的旅行最不可能需要旅行社的預訂協助？,"The correct answer is **A: 出差前去旅客曾去過的城市參加工作會議**

Here's why:

*   **The passage states that travel agencies are a good choice when:**
    *   The natural environment, culture, or language of the destination is beyond the traveler's experience.
    *   The destination is a low-income country.

*   **Option A doesn't fit these criteria:**
    *   The traveler has been to the city before, meaning the environment and culture are likely familiar.
    *   The purpose is a business meeting, which implies a more structured and potentially less unfamiliar experience compared to leisure travel.

*   **Options B, C, and D all suggest situations where a travel agency would be helpful:**
    *   **B (Specific budget, long trip):** Travel agencies can help with budget management and planning complex itineraries.
    *   **C (Language barrier):** Overcoming language barriers is a reason to use a travel agency.
    *   **D (First time abroad):** First-time international travel can be daunting, and a travel agency can provide support and guidance.

Therefore, A is the least likely scenario where a travel agency's assistance would be needed."
根據這段文字，在哪種情況下，旅客最能因旅行社的協助而受益？,"根據文章，旅行社在以下情況下是個不錯的選擇：

*   旅行目的地的自然環境、文化、語言超出旅客本身的經驗
*   旅行目的地是低收入國家

選項中，B 旅客第一次有興趣預訂特色短途旅行時，最符合文章中提到「專營特定類型的旅行」的情況，所以選 B。
"
根據這段文字，何者可以協助旅客在到訪新地方時不會失望？,"The correct answer is **B: 願意嘗試不熟悉的食物**. Here's why:

*   **The passage emphasizes that things will be different from home.** Options A, C, and D all involve expecting or imposing familiar standards, which directly contradicts the main point.
*   **The passage warns against being disappointed or disgusted by local ways.** Trying unfamiliar food is an example of embracing the differences and being open to new experiences, thus reducing the risk of negative reactions.

The passage does not explicitly state to try unfamiliar food, however it does state that food varies from one place to the next and in order to prevent being dissappointed it is important to be aware of these differences. Option B is therefore the most logical answer, assuming the traveler is aware that the food will be different to their home and they are therefore willing to try these unfamilar foods.
"
根據文中的資訊，什麼樣的人在去他鄉旅行時可能會感到失望？,"The correct answer is **C: 思想封閉的人 (People who are close-minded)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that when traveling, things will be different from ""home"" in many ways (customs, laws, food, etc.).
*   It also warns that you need to keep these differences in mind to avoid disappointment or even disgust with the local ways of doing things.
*   Therefore, people who are unwilling or unable to accept these differences (close-minded people) are the most likely to be disappointed when traveling.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 喜歡異國食物的人 (People who like foreign food):** People who enjoy foreign food are likely to embrace new experiences, and this will make them enjoy traveling to new places.
*   **B: 在變化中茁壯成長的人 (People who thrive on change):** These people are likely to enjoy the differences they encounter while traveling.
*   **D: 喜歡學習的人 (People who like to learn):** People who like to learn are more willing to accept new experiences when they travel to new places."
對於首次到訪發展中國家的旅客，不推薦以下哪項建議？,"The passage advises against sleeping on mattresses or mats on the ground in areas where you don't understand the local animal ecosystem. This implies that **before** sleeping on the ground, you *should* understand the local animal ecosystem. Therefore, option A is not recommended as it suggests learning about the animals **after** you've already slept on the ground.

The other options are directly supported by the text:

*   B: The text suggests spending money on Western-style food and services to help with adaptation, implying avoiding random food purchases at first.
*   C: The text explicitly recommends using a cot or hammock when camping to avoid snakes and scorpions.
*   D: The text explicitly recommends spending money on Western-style hotels initially to ease the transition.

Therefore, the answer is **A**.
"
在適應發展中國家時，沒有提到在以下哪一項東西上揮霍金錢？,"The passage specifically recommends spending more money on Western-style hotels, food, and services to help with the initial adjustment. It also recommends bringing a folding bed or hammock for camping. It does not mention spending money on camping mattresses or pads.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 露營用床墊或墊子 (Camping mattress or pad)**.
"
以下何者最適合想要保單虛擬副本但可能無法存取網路的投保人？,"The best answer is **C: 將副本儲存在筆電的記憶體中**

Here's why:

*   **The question is specifically asking about someone who *might not* have internet access.**
*   A: 雖然好，但並非以網路為基礎的副本
*   B: 需要網路存取才能接收電子郵件。
*   C: 您的問題表明這是在 *沒有網路的情況下*。 如果您的筆記型電腦上有副本，您可以隨時存取它。
*   D: 「雲端」儲存始終需要網路存取。

Therefore, storing the copy on the laptop's memory guarantees access regardless of internet connectivity."
根據這段文字，以下何者不需要顯示在保單上？,"The correct answer is **D: 投保人的電子郵件地址**.

The text explicitly states the policy should include the insurance company's email address and international phone number (for consultation/authorization and claims). It doesn't mention the policyholder's email address.
"
根據這段文字，哪種負片尺寸反映了最常用的底片格式？,"The correct answer is **C: 35 毫米負片**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""標準的 35 公釐底片 (36×24 公釐負片) 是最常見的。"" While option D, 36 x 24 mm, is the exact measurement, 35 mm is the more common way to refer to the film format."
以下哪種底片格式提供近似於數位單眼相機的解析度？,"The correct answer is **A: 35 毫米底片**.

The passage states that 35mm film has resolution ""comparable to modern DSLR cameras."" While medium format film has *higher* resolution, the question asks for which is *similar* to DSLR, so the answer is 35mm.
"
根據這段文字，何者將是進入遊記寫作產業的最後一步？,"The correct answer is **C: 建立自己的網站**.

The passage states: ""待你熟悉在網路上編排格式和編輯後，說不定就能打造你自己的網站."" This implies that creating your own website is a step taken *after* gaining experience with formatting and editing online, making it the final step mentioned in the given text.
"
進入遊記寫作產業時，應該首先完善以下哪些能力？,"根據題幹 P，進入遊記寫作產業最簡單的方式是透過寫部落格來鍛鍊技巧，並熟悉網路編排格式和編輯。因此，選項 A、B、C 都是應該首先完善的能力。 然而，題幹建議**之後**再打造自己的網站。

所以，最符合題幹敘述，且應該**首先**完善的能力，是 A、B 和 C。 如果只能選一個，那麼選項 A (寫部落格) 是最重要的起點，因為它是鍛鍊技巧的平台。

因此，雖然A、B、C都包含在內，但如果只能選一個，**A: 寫部落格** 最能概括。

但如果可以多選，則 **A, B, C** 都是正確答案。
"
腸道問題在什麼類型的氣候下很常見？,"The correct answer is **C: 炎熱的氣候**.

The passage states: ""就像寒冷氣候常見的呼吸系統問題，腸道問題在炎熱氣候也相當普遍..."" This clearly indicates that intestinal problems are common in hot climates.
"
根據這段文字，經常接觸什麼東西會對它產生免疫力？,"The correct answer is **B: 在地細菌**.

The passage states: ""由於在家持續接觸在地細菌，您很有可能已經對它們免疫了 (Because of continued exposure to local bacteria at home, you are likely to be immune to them)."" This directly links exposure to local bacteria with the development of immunity.
"
以下何者是在申根區內旅行的優點？,"The correct answers are **A, B, and C.**

*   **A: 避免多次申請簽證 (Avoid multiple visa applications)** - The passage explicitly states ""...you don't need to apply for separate visas for each Schengen member country, saving time, money, and paperwork.""
*   **B: 省錢 (Save money)** - This is also directly stated in the passage ""...saving time, money, and paperwork."" by not needing to apply for multiple visas.
*   **C: 避免多次護照檢查 (Avoid multiple passport checks)** - The passage explains ""...once you are in the area, you generally can cross borders without having to go through passport control checkpoints again.""
*   **D: 無護照要求 (No passport requirement)** - This is **incorrect**. The passage discusses avoiding *multiple* passport checks *within* the Schengen area. You still need a passport to enter the Schengen area initially.

Therefore, the best answer is **A, B, and C**.
"
圖坦卡門墓中再也找不到什麼東西？,"The correct answer is **D: 財富 (Wealth)**.

The passage states, ""陵墓裡各種令人歎為觀止的財富已不在陵墓內，而是被移往在開羅的埃及博物館 (The various stunning treasures in the tomb are no longer inside the tomb, but have been moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo).""
"
根據這段文字，溫哥華哪個目的地對注重價格的旅客最沒有吸引力？ ,"正確答案是 **D: 惠斯勒**

理由：

*   文章明確指出，惠斯勒因為 2010 年冬季奧運而變得「又貴又出名」。這意味著相較於其他選項，惠斯勒對注重價格的旅客來說吸引力較低。
*   文章中提到寶雲島適合一日遊，而且交通便利，暗示費用可能較低。海天走廊則沒有關於價格的描述。固蘭湖島是水上計程車的起點，並未直接描述是旅遊目的地。"
根據這段文字，哪個目的地最有可能賦予旅客真實的溫哥華體驗？,"The correct answer is **A: 寶雲島**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes Bowen Island as an ""authentic community."" Authentic implies a genuine and less touristy experience.
*   Whistler is described as ""expensive and famous"" due to the Olympics. This suggests a more commercialized and potentially less authentic experience.
*   Vancouver City Center and Granville Island are mentioned only as starting points for accessing Bowen Island and not as experiences themselves.

Therefore, Bowen Island is the most likely destination to provide a real, authentic taste of the Vancouver area based on the text."
根據這段文字，如果追求一覽無遺的景色，旅客應該何時到訪瀑布？,"The correct answer is **D: 除雨季之外 (Except for the rainy season)**.

The text states that during the rainy season (November to March), the increased water volume obscures the view of the falls. Therefore, to have an unobstructed view, you should visit outside of the rainy season.
"
根據這段文字，在十一月至三月期間參觀維多利亞瀑布有什麼優點？,"The correct answer is **C: 壯麗的瀑布景觀 (Zhuangli de pubu jingguan - Magnificent waterfall scenery)**.

The text explicitly states: ""雨季（十一月至三月）水量會高出許多，瀑布會更加壯觀。(Yuji (shiyiyue zhi sanyue) shuiliang hui gaochu henduo, pubu hui gengjia zhuangguan. - During the rainy season (November to March), the water volume will be much higher, and the waterfall will be more spectacular.)""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 一覽無遺的瀑布景觀 (Yilan wu yi de pubu jingguan - Unobstructed view of the waterfall)** - The text says the opposite: ""觀看瀑布本身的視線會被大量的水遮蔽！ (Guankan pubu benshen de shixian hui bei daliang de shui zhebi! - The view of the waterfall itself will be obscured by a large amount of water!)""
*   **B: 寥寥無幾的遊客 (Liaoliao wu ji de youke - Few tourists)** - The text doesn't mention anything about the number of tourists during the rainy season.
*   **D: 避開雨季 (Bikai yuji - Avoid the rainy season)** - November to March *is* the rainy season, so this is the opposite of an advantage."
根據這段文字，使用無人機拍攝時，不建議使用以下何者？,"The correct answer is **D: 僅在無人機不會引起注意的人群擁擠區拍攝**.

The passage explicitly states that flying a drone over crowds is almost always a bad idea, even if legal. Options A, B, and C are all things the passage recommends doing.
"
根據這段文字，使用無人機拍攝的最佳地點在哪裡？,"基於這段文字，最符合的答案是 **D: 事先取得許可的地區**。

理由：

*   原文強調了使用無人機需要事先確認可拍攝內容以及所需許可。
*   原文明確指出，機場附近或人群上方不是好選擇，排除了A和C。
*   原文提及攝影規範適用於錄影，所以若不允許攝影的地方，也不允許錄影，排除了B。

因此，事先取得許可才能確保拍攝的合法性與安全性，也與原文的強調相符。
"
根據這段文字，關於簽證程序的註冊要求，哪種說法為非？,"正確答案是 **B: 所有國家/地區都要求向當地政府機關登記註冊**。

原因：

*   文章明確指出 ""在**某些**國家/地區，你必須...""，這表示並非所有國家都要求登記。 其他選項 A, C 和 D 都直接來自文章的資訊，都是真實的。"
以下何者不是遊客可能去辦理登記註冊的地方？,"The correct answer is **C: 當地郵局**.

The passage mentions local police stations, hotels, and immigration offices as possible registration locations. It doesn't mention post offices.
"
誰不會因旅行時參加志願活動而受益？,"正確答案是 **B: 追求豐厚薪水的人**

原因：

* **選項 B 符合文章的反面。** 文章提到志願工作可能提供食宿或微薄薪水，但不是豐厚薪水。 因此，追求豐厚薪水的人不會從旅行時參加志願活動中受益。
* **選項 A、C、D 符合文章中提到參加志願活動的好處。** 文章提到參加志願活動可以認識新朋友 (A)、獲得新技能 (C)，以及食宿 (D)。"
根據這段文字，在國外做志工對預算有限的旅客有什麼好處？,"The correct answer is **C: 有時會提供食宿**.

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""由於許多志願性的工作均提供食宿，而少數工作還支付微薄薪水，這也不失為放寬預算，以便在某個地方停留更久的好方法.""

*   This directly indicates that volunteers **often** receive accommodation and food and **sometimes** a small salary. This is beneficial for travelers on a budget because it reduces their expenses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 幾乎都有給薪 (Almost all are paid)** - The text says only a *few* jobs offer a small salary, not *almost all*.
*   **B: 通常會帶來工作機會 (Usually leads to job opportunities)** - The text does not mention that volunteering typically leads to paid job opportunities.
*   **D: 可以幫助取得看事情的某種角度 (Can help obtain a certain perspective on things)** - While this is a benefit of volunteering abroad, it doesn't directly address how it helps with a limited budget.

"
根據這段文字，何者可能被認為是一般前往迪士尼世界旅行的非典型行程？,"正確答案是 **B: 住在園區外的飯店**

理由：

*   文章提到「最『典型』的行程包括...搭巴士前往迪士尼飯店...在迪士尼園區玩上一週後再回家」。這暗示了住在迪士尼飯店內是典型行程的一部分。
*   因此，住在園區外的飯店就屬於非典型行程。

其他選項：

*   A: 在迪士尼園區玩上一週：文章明確說明這是典型行程的一部分。
*   C: 在迪士尼園區度過整個旅程：雖然文中沒有直接提到是否有人 *只* 在園區內活動，但這與住在園區飯店的描述一致，因此不一定是非典型。
*   D: 從機場坐巴士到飯店：文章中提到搭巴士是典型行程的一部分。"
關於迪士尼世界的陳述中，以下何者為非？,"根據文章，迪士尼禁止門票轉讓，因此跨園門票**不可**轉讓給其他旅客。

選項B、C、D都可以在文章中找到支持。

因此，正確答案是：

**A: 跨園門票可轉讓給其他旅客**
"
根據這段文字，在專業培訓課程或出版物中最有可能沒有涵蓋以下哪個問題？,"The correct answer is **A: 荒野求生 (Wilderness survival)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions that books and magazines about wilderness survival are common (""有關荒野求生的書籍和雜誌很常見""), implying that this topic is **not** scarce.
*   The passage directly states that professional training courses often include role-playing (""角色扮演"") and extensive first aid training (""大量的急救訓練"").
*   The passage focuses on preparing people for war zones, making war zone readiness (""戰區戰備"") the central theme.
*   Therefore, wilderness survival is the least likely to be missing from professional training courses or publications about war zones because it is a widely available topic.
"
根據這段文字，專業培訓課程最有可能涵蓋以下哪些科目？,"The correct answer is **A: 急救 (First Aid)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the training courses include ""大量的急救訓練 (a lot of first aid training).""

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: 戰區 (War Zone):** While the entire passage deals with war zones, the courses themselves are not a subject *about* war zones. They prepare you to *operate* in war zones.
*   **C: 荒野求生 (Wilderness Survival):** The passage mentions that wilderness survival books are common, but specifically states that war zone survival publications are rare. This implies the courses focus on war zone specifics, not general wilderness survival.
*   **D: 惡劣的環境 (Hostile Environment):** While these courses are called hostile environment courses, ""hostile environment"" is a general term. We're looking for the *specific subject matter* covered. The text lists specific topics the courses delve into."
根據這段文字，避開潛在污水的最佳選擇是什麼？,"The best answer is **B: 購買瓶裝水**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""如果您有任何疑慮，不妨向商譽良好的公司購買密封的瓶裝水."" This suggests that bottled water is a reliable option when you're unsure about the water quality.

Let's analyze the other options:

*   A: 將水燒開幾分鐘 - The passage mentions that the time varies by region, so this isn't a universally safe option.
*   C: 將水燒開一分鐘 - The passage mentions that one minute may be enough in *some* regions, but not all.
*   D: 評估水中的特定威脅 - This is not a practical solution for many people as it requires expertise and resources.

Therefore, the most straightforward and reliable choice, according to the text, is purchasing bottled water."
根據這段文字，什麼事情是連熟練的游泳者也幾乎不可能做到的？,"The passage states: ""大部分致死原因都是在嘗試逆著海流游回去時用盡體力，此舉成功率可能非常渺茫.""

This means trying to swim against the rip current is extremely difficult, even for strong swimmers.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 逆著海流游回去 (Swimming against the current)**.
"
如果困在海流中，該怎麼辦？,"正確答案是 **A: 試著改變方向來脫離水流，然後正常游回岸邊**

原因如下：

*   原文中提到：「一旦您脫離了洋流，游回岸並不比平時困難。試著遊向一個不會再被困住的地方...」這明確表示應該嘗試脫離水流，然後正常游回岸邊。
*   B 和 C 都違反了原文中「大部分致死原因都是在嘗試逆著海流游回去時用盡體力」的說法。
*   D 沒有任何根據，且在海流中並不安全。

因此，選項 A 最符合原文的資訊。"
根據這段文字，在哪個地方參觀城堡可能會是一趟值得的假期遊覽？,"The correct answer is **C: 萊茵河谷**.

The passage specifically mentions ""參觀羅亞爾河谷及萊茵河谷的城堡"" (visiting the castles of the Loire Valley and Rhine Valley). Therefore, the Rhine Valley is a place explicitly stated as having castles worth visiting on a vacation.
"
根據這段文字，以下哪個方法不推薦給在該地區旅行的女性？,"The passage explicitly recommends claiming to be married (even if you aren't) and wearing a ring. Therefore, avoiding discussing marital status is the *opposite* of what's recommended. The other options are all directly or indirectly supported by the passage.

So the answer is **A: 避免討論婚姻狀況 (Avoid discussing marital status)**.
"
根據文中所述區域，什麼小常識對女性旅客有幫助？,"The correct answer is **D: 不願接受男性示好，即堅決拒絕 (Unwilling to accept male advances means being firm in refusal)**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""拒絕男性時應表現堅定，不要害怕堅持立場 (Refuse men firmly, don't be afraid to stand your ground).""

Let's examine why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 認知到遭人跟蹤並非常事 (Recognizing that being stalked is not common)** The passage states that being followed is ""not uncommon"", so this option is incorrect.
*   **B: 戴大戒指表示婚姻狀況 (Wearing a big ring indicates marital status)** The passage recommends wearing *a* ring, but specifically advises against wearing one that looks too expensive.
*   **C: 瞭解文化差異間接表明您避免堅持自己的立場 (Understanding cultural differences indirectly indicates that you avoid insisting on your position)** The passage actually encourages firmness and standing your ground, regardless of cultural differences."
根據這段文字，哪種情況可能需要野生動物攝影師使用專業鏡頭？,"The correct answer is **A: 如果他們正在拍攝特別小的生物 (If they are photographing particularly small creatures)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""...while photographing a group of birds or a small animal requires other lenses."" This indicates that specific lenses are needed for small subjects.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 如果是商業化拍攝 (If it is commercial photography):** The text mentions restrictions on commercial shooting, but not necessarily the *need* for a specialized lens.
*   **C: 如果拍攝的動物很害羞 (If the animal being photographed is shy):** The shyness of the animal might require patience and technique, but not specifically a different lens.
*   **D: 如果公園對野生動物攝影有特殊規定 (If the park has special regulations for wildlife photography):** Park regulations may impact *where* or *how* you can shoot, but they don't directly dictate the need for a particular lens."
文中沒有提到以下何者對野生動物攝影師來說是一個潛在的挑戰？,"The correct answer is **C: 採購所需的鏡頭類型 (Acquiring the necessary lens types)**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 尋找特定的珍稀動物 (Finding specific rare animals)** is mentioned directly: ""許多珍稀的動物很難發現 (Many rare animals are difficult to find).""
*   **B: 面對具攻擊性的動物 (Dealing with aggressive animals)** is mentioned directly: ""野生動物可能很...很有攻擊性 (Wildlife can be...aggressive).""
*   **D: 在潛在的敵對環境中工作 (Working in potentially hostile environments)** is mentioned directly: ""生存環境可能很冷、很熱或很不友善 (Survival environments can be very cold, very hot or very unfriendly).""

While the text mentions needing different lenses, it doesn't say that *acquiring* those lenses is a challenge. It simply states what is needed: ""野生動物攝影通常需要使用長焦鏡頭，而拍攝一群鳥類或一隻小型動物則需要其他鏡頭 (Wildlife photography often requires the use of long focal length lenses, while shooting a group of birds or a small animal requires other lenses).""
"
以下何者可能最不會對途經山口的司機造成問題？,"The passage discusses the following problems drivers might face when driving in high altitudes or on mountain roads:

*   Snowfall, ice, or sub-freezing temperatures
*   Low friction on icy and snowy roads
*   Blizzards and heavy snowfall
*   Reduced visibility due to snow, blowing snow, condensation, or ice on windows

Based on this information, here's an evaluation of the given options:

*   **A: 塞車 (Traffic Jams)** - While traffic jams can occur anywhere, the passage doesn't specifically link them to the weather-related hazards of mountain driving. Therefore, this is the least explicitly mentioned problem for drivers in the passage.
*   **B: 低摩擦力 (Low Friction)** - The passage explicitly states that there's low friction on icy and snowy roads.
*   **C: 過度冷凝作用 (Excessive Condensation)** - Condensation is mentioned as a factor that can reduce visibility.
*   **D: 可見度降低 (Reduced Visibility)** - The passage directly mentions that visibility can be reduced due to snow, blowing snow, condensation, or ice.

Therefore, the answer is **A: 塞車 (Traffic Jams)**.
"
關於各國的所得稅，何者可能保持一致？,"The correct answer is **C: 申報所得稅的地方**.

Here's why:

*   **P** states that working abroad *generally* means you have to file income taxes in that country, *unless* you are a diplomat. This suggests that the *place* where you file (i.e., the country where you're working) is a fairly consistent factor.
*   **A, B, and D** are all explicitly stated in the passage as varying significantly between countries: ""所得稅結構各不相同，各國的稅率及等級差異也相當大"" (""income tax structures differ, and the tax rates and grade differences vary greatly from country to country"").

Therefore, only C aligns with the information given in the passage."
根據這段文字，如果你在海外工作，但居住在他處，你可能會在哪裡申報所得稅？,"The correct answer is **C: 目前工作的國家**.

The passage explicitly states: ""除非你是外交官，否則在海外工作通常表示你必須在所在國家申報所得稅.""  This directly implies that the country where you are currently working is likely where you would need to file income taxes.
"
關於世界博覽會的敘述，以下何者不正確？,"The correct answer is **B: 植物展覽品與藝術及教育展覽品一起陳列**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 展覽品可能會展示一個國家/地區的歷史或文化** - The passage states ""參與國會在各自的國家館設置藝術或教育展，用以展示世界議題或該國的文化與歷史,"" which supports this statement.
*   **B: 植物展覽品與藝術及教育展覽品一起陳列** - The passage differentiates between World Expos (which showcase art and education) and World Horticultural Expos (which showcase plants). Therefore, this statement is incorrect.
*   **C: 活動可持續長達六個月** - The passage states ""這些活動通常會持續 3 至 6 個月,"" which supports this statement.
*   **D: 國家/地區非強迫參與** - The passage doesn't state that participation is mandatory; it implies voluntary participation by saying ""參與國會在各自的國家館設置..."". Therefore this is most likely a true statement, based on inference.

Therefore, the only incorrect statement is B."
以下哪項是世界博覽會或國際博覽會的規則？,"The correct answer is **B: 同一國家不能每年舉辦活動 (The same country cannot hold the event every year)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""...儘管理論上可以年年舉辦（只要辦在不同國家/地區就好了），實際上則不然 (Although in theory it could be held every year (as long as it is held in different countries/regions), in practice it is not)."" This implies that the same country cannot hold the event every year.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 展覽品必須同時展示一個國家的歷史和世界議題 (Exhibits must showcase both a country's history and world issues):** The passage mentions that countries can use their pavilions to display either world issues OR the country's culture and history, not necessarily both.

*   **C: 活動必須持續長達六個月 (Events must last up to six months):** The passage states that the events usually last 3 to 6 months, not that they *must* last 6 months.

*   **D: 為了舉辦博覽會，所有國家/地區都必須參加 (All countries/regions must participate in order to hold the expo):** The passage does not state that all countries must participate. It simply states that participating countries set up exhibits."
採取以下哪一項措施可以降低動物攻擊的可能性？,"The correct answer is **B: 清除野營地的垃圾 (Cleaning up trash in campsites)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that strong smells attract bears and other wildlife, and that keeping campsites clean is important. Cleaning up trash reduces smells and minimizes the chance of attracting animals.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 攜帶有香氣的草藥 (Carrying fragrant herbs):** The passage states that smells can attract bears and other animals.
*   **C: 與狼保持 25 碼的距離 (Keeping a distance of 25 yards from wolves):** The passage specifies a distance of 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves.
*   **D: 用食物殘渣阻撓動物 (Distracting animals with food scraps):** The passage specifically advises against feeding animals."
文中未提到以下何者為野生動物襲擊的可能原因？,"The correct answer is **D: 不熟悉人類的動物**

Here's why:

*   **A: 強烈的氣味** - The passage explicitly states, ""要注意氣味會吸引熊和其他野生動物，因此請避免攜帶或烹煮氣味濃重的食物...""

*   **B: 未能保持距離** - The passage states ""每年有數十名遊客因為未保持適當距離而受傷。"" and stresses the importance of maintaining a specific distance from animals.

*   **C: 餵養野生動物** - While not explicitly stated as a cause for attacks, the first sentence says ""...野生動物畢竟是野生的，因此不應餵食或打擾它們,"" which implies that feeding them is dangerous. The passage warns to avoid disturbing or feeding the animals, implying it's a dangerous act.

*   **D: 不熟悉人類的動物** - The passage mentions that animals in the park are used to seeing humans, implying familiarity. The problem isn't that animals aren't familiar with humans; it's that they're still wild and potentially aggressive even if they appear tame.

Therefore, the passage does *not* explicitly mention that animals attacking humans because they are unfamiliar with humans."
根據文章，以下哪個不會被認為是順利演奏手風琴的正確建議？,"正確答案是 **A: 要增大音量，請增加敲擊按鍵的力度**。

文章中明確說明，不需要像彈鋼琴一樣用力敲擊琴鍵來增加音量。相反地，文章指出應透過更用力或更快速擠壓風箱來增加音量。 因此，A 與文章中的建議相矛盾。

B、C 和 D 都符合文章的建議。
"
當演奏手風琴時，以下哪個有助於增加音量？,"The correct answer is **B: 加大力道** (Increase the force).

The passage states: ""彈手風琴時，若要增大音量，可更用力或更快速擠壓風箱。"" (When playing the accordion, to increase the volume, you can squeeze the bellows harder or faster.) 加大力道 (Increase the force) refers to squeezing the bellows harder.
"
電視上的影像為什麼要裁剪邊框？,"正確答案是 **B: 讓影像填滿整個螢幕**

段落中明確指出，裁剪邊框（過掃描）的目的是「確保圖像能蓋滿整個螢幕」。
"
根據文章，將電影轉換為 DVD 格式可能會遇到以下哪些問題？,"The correct answer is **B: 部分字幕會被裁減**.

The passage states: ""Problem is, when making a DVD, the edges are still likely to be cut off, and if the film's subtitles are too close to the bottom, they may not be fully visible."" This directly supports option B.
"
英國駐軍在哪裡？,"The correct answer is **C: 博登敦鎮 (Bordentown)**.

The passage states that John Cadwalder will attack the British garrison at Bordentown.
"
手寫草案上出現了誰的簽名？,"The correct answer is **D: Charles Thomson**.

The passage states: ""a handwritten draft signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop...""
"
在以下地點中，哪個地方最後收到當列普單面印刷版？,"正確答案是 **C: 倫敦**。

解釋：
* 紐約在 7 月 9 日收到。
* 當列普印刷坊是印刷這些單面印刷版的地方。
* 費城獨立紀念館在 7 月 8 日宣讀。
* 倫敦在 8 月 10 日收到。

由於 8 月 10 日比 7 月 8 日和 9 日晚，因此倫敦是最後收到當列普單面印刷版的地點。
"
史塔克上校的的部隊位於哪裡？,"The best answer is **A: 北端柵欄沿線的位置**.

While the passage mentions Stark's men extending the wall to a beach and a stake being placed in front of the fence, their primary position was along the fence line at the northern end.
"
根據文章，史塔克的手下什麼時候擴展了他們的柵欄？,"The correct answer is **C: 退潮時 (Retreating tide)**.

The text says: ""沿著半島西北部流動的神秘河，在退潮時打開了一個缺口，他們利用這個時機迅速建造小石牆，將圍牆延伸到北方河流末端的小沙灘上。 (Along the peninsula's northwest, the Mystic River created a gap at low tide, which they used to quickly build a small stone wall, extending the wall north to the small sandy beach at the river's end.)"" This clearly states that they extended the fence during low tide.
"
根據文章，以下哪個是中國最動盪的時期之一？,"The correct answer is **D: 三國時期**

The passage explicitly states that ""三國是中國古代歷史上最血腥的時代之一"" (The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history).
"
根據文章，關於螞蟻大軍群體進入游獵階段，以下敘述何者為真？,"The correct answer is **B: 牠們糧食供應不足**.

Here's why:

*   **P: 螞蟻大軍也在不同階段行軍和築巢。 在游獵階段，行軍蟻會在夜晚行動，白天停下來紮營。 當食物量減少時，殖民地居民進入了一種遊牧階段。**
*   The text states that when food supply dwindles, the colony enters the nomadic phase, not the statary (游獵) phase.
*   The statary (游獵) phase is described as when the ants march at night and camp during the day, which doesn't involve food shortage.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 牠們在夜間築巢** - The text says they camp (築巢) during the day.
*   **C: 他們築巢的週期為 17 天** - The 17-day cycle refers to the nomadic (遊牧) phase, not the statary (游獵) phase.
*   **D: 牠們在白天行進** - The text says they march at night."
根據文章，以下哪種說法正確反映了螞蟻大軍在遊牧階段的築巢習性？,"The correct answer is **C: 牠們每天更換巢穴 (They change nests every day)**.

The passage states: ""在此階段，殖民地居民建築起暫時性的住所，並且每天變換 (In this phase, the colony builds temporary shelters and changes them every day)."" This directly supports option C.
"
儘管出現外在信號，以下何者會繼續運行？,"The passage states: ""生理時鐘是自我維持的振盪器，即使沒有外部信號，也會持續自主運行的週期.""  This directly implies that even with or without external cues, the biological clock continues to run on its own.

Therefore, the best answer is **C: 生理時鐘** (Biological clock).
"
哪個術語描述了呈現特定表徵多種差異的個體？,"The correct answer is **D: 多態性**

The passage clearly states: ""如果個體某項特徵呈現多種差異，即稱為多態性。""
"
關於佔據特定區域的生物，以下何者為正確術語？,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: 族群 (Population)**.

The definition of ""族群 (Population)"" directly matches the description in statement P: ""族群指的是在特定地理區域中活動的單一特定物種生物個體組成的群體 (Population refers to a group of individuals of a single, specific species of organisms that operate in a specific geographic area).""

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: 單型性 (Monomorphism)** refers to the state where all individuals in a population are uniform for a particular trait, not the term for the group itself.
*   **C: 物種 (Species)** is a broader classification, referring to a group of organisms capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring. While a population is comprised of a single species, ""species"" itself isn't the term for the group in a specific area.
*   **D: 多態性 (Polymorphism)** refers to the presence of multiple different forms or traits within a population, not the term for the group itself."
以下哪種不是以自然為主題的旅遊活動範例？,"正確答案是 **C: 參觀科學博物館**

理由如下：

*   **P 段落** 明確說明以自然為主題的旅遊行程著重於自然景觀和野生動植物，並列舉了打獵、釣魚、攝影、賞鳥、參觀公園和研習生態系統等活動。
*   **A、B 和 D** 都屬於在自然環境中進行的活動，符合以自然為主題的定義。
*   **C: 參觀科學博物館** 雖然可能與自然科學相關，但它是在室內環境進行的活動，並且不是直接體驗自然景觀或野生動植物。
"
根據文章，以下哪個是交通系統的基礎？,"The correct answer is **B: 私家車** (Private cars).

The passage explicitly states that the ""traffic system"" is ""based on private cars"" (私家車為基礎). The other options are either a consequence of the system (work destinations) or a condition threatened by the system (stable biosphere, human evolution).
"
環繞原子核的粒子具有哪種電荷？,"The passage states: ""electrons ... have a negative charge."" The question asks about the charge of the particles that orbit the nucleus, which are electrons.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: 負電荷 (Negative charge).
"
原子核由哪些粒子組成？,"The correct answer is **A: 質子和中子**.

The passage explicitly states: ""原子核由中子和質子兩種粒子組成。"" (The nucleus is composed of two kinds of particles, neutrons and protons.)
"
根據文章，下列哪個是五位元二進制的例子？,"正確答案是 C: 10010

**理由:**

* **P** 聲明二進位系統只使用 0 和 1。
* **Q** 要求一個五位元的二進位數。

讓我們檢查一下選項：

* **A: 1010** - 只有四個位元。
* **B: 12001** - 包含 2，這不是一個二進位數字。
* **C: 10010** - 只有 0 和 1，並且有五個位元。
* **D: 110101** - 有六個位元。

因此，只有選項 C 符合條件。
"
二進位數也被稱為什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 位元**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Binary digits are called bits, in computer terminology.""
"
文中沒有提到以下何者為學生寫部落格的主要好處？,"The correct answer is **B: 減少來自同儕的批評**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 改善文法與寫作能力:** The passage explicitly states that students improve their grammar and spelling due to the presence of readers and the desire to avoid criticism.
*   **C: 拓展對周圍環境的認識:** The passage mentions that blogging ""forces students to become more aware of the world around them.""
*   **D: 增進持續學習的渴望:** The passage states that blogging encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional classroom.

The passage doesn't say blogging *reduces* criticism, but rather that the *fear* of criticism motivates students to improve."
寫部落格的哪個方面被引用為學生提高寫作能力的動力？,"The correct answer is **B: 避免批評的慾望**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""由於學生通常是最挑剔的讀者，因此部落客作者們會開始努力加強寫作以避免被批評.""  This directly links the desire to avoid criticism from readers (especially student readers) as a motivator for students to improve their writing when blogging.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: 頻繁回應網路上的材料:** While the passage mentions responding to online materials enhances analytical and critical abilities, it's not directly cited as the primary *motivation* for improving writing skills in the context of blogging.
*   **C: 維持他們受眾的興趣:** While maintaining audience interest is mentioned as a benefit (""為了滿足觀眾的興趣，激發學生變得更加聰明有趣""), the primary motivation for improved writing is avoiding criticism, not just keeping the audience entertained.
*   **D: 合作的需要:** While collaboration is a benefit of blogging, the text specifically connects improved writing to the fear of criticism.
"
以下哪一項並非非同步交流對學生的好處？ ,"根據原文，選項A (使用網際網路作為資源)、C (靈活的工作時間) 和 D (步調控制) 都是非同步交流的好處。

選項B (隨時面對面與教師接觸) **不是**非同步交流的好處。非同步交流是指並非即時的溝通方式，因此無法隨時面對面。

因此，正確答案是：

**B: 隨時面對面與教師接觸**
"
根據文章，以下非同步交流的哪個方面對學生並不彈性？,"根據文章，非同步交流提供彈性在於：

*   **學習步調:** 學生得以按照自己的步調學習。
*   **教材呈現速度:** 學生控制教學資訊的呈現速度。
*   **工作時間:** 時間限制較少，讓工作時間可以更加靈活。
*   **網際網路使用:** 網際網路和全球資訊網的使用，讓學習者無時無刻都能取得資訊。

然而，雖然學生可以隨時提交問題，但**回覆需要等待**。文章說「在合理時間內快速得到回覆，不必等到下一次面對面的會談。」 這表示回覆並非即時的，需要一段時間。

題目問的是「哪個方面對學生**並不彈性**」，以上選項中只有網際網路使用不是完全彈性的。

因此，正確答案是 **D: 網際網路使用**。
"
文中沒有提到以下何者為中世紀城堡的相關事物？,"The passage mentions all of the options:

*   **A: 地牢坑 (Dungeon pits)**: ""感受到來自地牢坑裡的恐懼氣息"" (feel the fear emanating from the dungeon pits)
*   **B: 馬上長槍比武 (Tournaments)**: ""想起馬上長槍比武、宴會和亞瑟王時代騎士精神的影像"" (conjures up images of jousting tournaments, banquets and Arthurian chivalry)
*   **C: 騎士精神 (Chivalry)**: ""想起馬上長槍比武、宴會和亞瑟王時代騎士精神的影像"" (conjures up images of jousting tournaments, banquets and Arthurian chivalry)
*   **D: 騎士 (Knights)**: ""想起馬上長槍比武、宴會和亞瑟王時代騎士精神的影像"" (conjures up images of jousting tournaments, banquets and Arthurian chivalry)

All of the choices are explicitly or implicitly mentioned. However, the question asks which wasn't mentioned in **relation to medieval castles**. The passage asks what was the reason for building the castles and their design. Therefore, the answer is **C: 騎士精神 (Chivalry)**, as it is only mentioned as an image evoked by the castles, not a feature of their construction or purpose."
文中沒有提到以下何者為城堡遺址中聞到的味道或聽到的聲音？,"The correct answer is **C: 宴會 (Feasts)**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 戰鬥 (Battles)**: The passage mentions ""戰爭的聲音和氣味"" (the sounds and smells of war).
*   **B: 恐懼 (Fear)**: The passage mentions ""來自地牢坑裡的恐懼氣息"" (the atmosphere of fear from the dungeon pits).
*   **D: 馬蹄聲 (Hooves)**: The passage mentions ""鵝卵石地上達達的蹄聲"" (the clattering of hooves on the cobblestones).
*   **C: 宴會 (Feasts)**: While the passage mentions feasts as part of the imagined image of castles, it does **not** mention them as something that can be smelled or heard at a castle ruin.

Therefore, the passage does not mention ""宴會"" as a smell or sound one might experience at a castle ruin."
以下哪一項是對柯比莫斯洛城堡的正確描述？,"根據段落 P，柯比莫斯洛城堡並非為了承受長時間和猛攻所建造，因此選項 D 不正確。段落也指出，當時國家相對和平，只需要抵禦小群掠奪者，這表示選項 B 「國家一直以來都很和平，因此建造城堡時，僅需最低程度的防禦工事」最符合段落的描述。

因此，答案是：
**B**

就文中所述當時的柯比莫斯洛城堡而言，以下哪項描述為非典型的建築特徵？,"The passage states that Kirby Muxloe Castle had large glass windows and thin walls, which weren't suitable for withstanding a prolonged siege. It also mentions that the castle was more like a fortified house than a ""real"" castle, implying fewer defenses.

The passage *doesn't* mention the *type* of foundation it has, but it does say that this castle was more like a fortified house than a ""real"" castle. Since it was more like a house, it would make sense that it would *not* have a foundation built to withstand an attack like a normal castle would.

*   **A: Large windows:** The passage explicitly states that it had large glass windows, making this a typical feature for Kirby Muxloe but an *untypical* feature for castles in general, especially those meant to withstand attacks.
*   **B: Foundations built to withstand attack:** The passage suggests Kirby Muxloe was more of a fortified house. Normal castles should have a foundations built to withstand attack.
*   **C: Fewer fortifications than some castles:** The passage indicates this by saying it's more like a fortified house than a ""real"" castle.
*   **D: Thin walls:** The passage explicitly states it had thin walls.

The question asks for a description that is *untypical* for castles during that time. The description that does *not* fit is **B: Foundations built to withstand attack**. It can be inferred from the passage that this castle does not have foundations built to withstand attack, and because of this, this is an atypical (unusual) architectural feature.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B**.
"
根據文章，以下哪一項最有益於準備新賽季的跑者？,"The correct answer is **D: 利用健身房鍛鍊上半身**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states:** ""冬天適度的越野長跑，加上強化上身的體操訓練，是為跑季準備的最佳方式"" which translates to ""Moderate cross-country running in the winter, along with upper body gymnastics training, is the best way to prepare for the running season."" Gymnasium workouts focus on upper body strength training.
* The prompt mentioned ""體操訓練"", which means gymnastics or physical exercises. Exercise that strengthen the upper body fits the description.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 夏天練習越野長跑 (Practice cross-country running in the summer):** The passage suggests cross-country running in the *winter*, not summer.
*   **B: 著重於培養速度的訓練 (Training that focuses on developing speed):** The passage states that endurance is now more important than speed due to the increased distance.
*   **C: 在三分鐘內跑完 (Run in three minutes):** This isn't mentioned or implied as a primary training goal in the passage.
"
根據文章，以下哪個對於一流的半英里賽跑者來說最重要？,"The passage explicitly states that ""耐力變成為絕對必要的條件"" (endurance becomes absolutely necessary) and that a top runner ""不論如何一定要培養耐力"" (must develop endurance no matter what). It also implies that speed is already a given for top runners (""速度一定夠快,"" speed must be fast enough).

Therefore, the best answer is **B: 培養耐力勝過速度 (Cultivating endurance over speed)**.
"
對於一位運動員來說，以下哪個不能單靠營養習慣來實現？,"The correct answer is **C: 頂尖成績**.

The passage states that ""僅攝取適當的營養並無法造就頂尖的成績"" (simply consuming proper nutrition cannot create top results). The other options (提高表現, 增加樂趣, 整體健康) are all mentioned as being positively influenced by proper nutrition.
"
根據文章，以下哪個不被建議作為年輕運動員在運動中找到更多樂趣的方法？,"The correct answer is **B: 持續造就頂尖成績**.

The passage states that adequate nutrition alone won't guarantee top performance, but it does *contribute* to improved performance and increased enjoyment. The passage suggests to the young athletes, that good things, like improved performance and increased enjoyment, will come from keeping a healthy energy balance, drinking with effective habits, and having a full understanding on taking nutrition supplements. Therefore, while all the other choices are implied as helpful with this goal, ""continuously creating top performance"" is not implied as being helpful in making them find more enjoyment in sports.
"
根據文章，為什麼中長跑跑者可能會購買更昂貴的設備？,"The correct answer is **A: 他們的個人喜好 (Their personal preferences)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""即使產品無法提供真正的好處，運動員仍偏好使用某產品。"" This directly translates to athletes preferring a certain product even if it doesn't offer real benefits, meaning their personal preference drives the purchase.
*   B is incorrect because the passage states that the items don't have ""公認的好處 (recognized benefits)""
*   C is incorrect because the passage states that the items don't ""大大影響他們的成績 (greatly affect their results)""
*   D is incorrect because the passage says that there are a ""許多錯誤觀念 (many misconceptions)"" around these equipments, not that they misunderstand lower-priced equipments.

Therefore, A is the best answer."
根據文章，中長跑跑者需要什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 非常少的設備 (Very few equipment)**.

The passage states that ""中長跑是一種相對花費較少的運動項目，用以參加此項競技所需的裝備極少"" which translates to ""Middle and long-distance running is a relatively inexpensive sport, and very little equipment is required to participate in this competition.""
"
誰發現了核磁共振？ ,"The correct answer is **C: 布洛赫和珀塞爾**.

The passage states: ""The basis of MRI is a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (Harvard University).""
"
哪一年授予第一項磁振造影的專利？ ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

The passage states: ""Four years later obtained a patent, this was the world’s first patent in the field of MRI. In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed construction of the first ‘whole-body’ MRI scanner..."" This implies the patent was granted before the scanner was completed in 1977. The passage states that Dr. Damadian discovered the principle in 1970 and obtained the patent four years later. Thus, 1970 + 4 = 1974.
"
根據文章，為了解讀他人的身體動作，人類應對什麼有強大的理解力？,"The correct answer is **B: 意圖 (Intentions)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""這些能力中，能夠了解他人的意圖至關重要 (Of these abilities, the ability to understand the intentions of others is crucial)."" It then uses the example of breaking a car window to illustrate how understanding the *intention* behind the action is vital for correct interpretation.
"
根據文章，理解意圖有助於人類做什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 消除身體動作背後的不確定性**.

The passage states that understanding intentions helps us clarify the ""ambiguous meanings"" of physical actions. Breaking a car window could be theft or a legitimate attempt to enter one's own vehicle. Understanding the *intention* behind the action helps us resolve the uncertainty about what the person is *actually* doing.

Let's look at why the other options are not the *best* answer:

*   **B: 預測渴望:** While understanding intentions *can* sometimes help us infer desires, the passage specifically highlights its role in interpreting *actions*, not just predicting desires.
*   **C: 無偏見地看待其他人:** Understanding intentions can *potentially* lead to less biased judgment, but the passage's focus is on clarifying actions, not directly on reducing bias.
*   **D: 揣摩他人心思:** This is too broad. Understanding intentions is *part* of mind-reading, but the question asks what understanding intention helps us *do* according to the passage. The passage specifies it helps with ambiguous actions.

"
根據文章，以下哪一項是人工智慧主要目的的正確總結？,"The correct answer is **D: 任務自動化**.

Here's why:

*   **P** The passage states that AI research aims to ""製造出可自動執行需以智慧行為完成任務的機器"" (produce machines that can automatically perform tasks requiring intelligent behavior). This directly equates to task automation.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: 計畫 (Planning)**: Planning is mentioned as an example of AI research, but it's not the overarching goal.
*   **B: 語音辨識 (Speech Recognition)**: Similar to planning, speech recognition is one of the things AI can do, but not the main objective.
*   **C: 排程 (Scheduling)**: Like the others, scheduling is a specific capability within the broader goal of automation.

Therefore, **D** is the best summary of the main purpose of AI according to the passage."
根據文章，以下哪一項經常與人工智慧聯想一起？,"The correct answer is **B: 計畫與排程**, **C: 科幻小說**, and **D: 辨識手寫文字**.

The passage explicitly mentions ""計畫與排程"" and ""辨識手寫文字"" as examples of what AI research focuses on. It also mentions that AI has ""很強的科幻內涵"", so this makes option C correct too.

While AI can be used in customer service, the passage doesn't specifically mention it as an area of focus in AI research or as something commonly associated with AI *within the context of this passage*. Therefore, A is incorrect."
根據文章，聚斂性思考模式的人具有以下哪一項優勢？,"The correct answer is **D: 記憶模式**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""這類思考模式的人擅邏輯，他們能記住模式、解決問題、進行科學測試。"" (People with this kind of thinking are good at logic, they can remember patterns, solve problems, and conduct scientific tests).
*   The passage also emphasizes that convergent thinking seeks only one correct answer, contradicting option A.
*   The focus is on speed and efficiency, so C is incorrect.
*   While reapplying existing techniques is mentioned, option B focuses on ""new"" technologies, which isn't the primary strength."
根據文章，以下哪一項不被認為是聚斂性思考模式的重點？,"正確答案是 **B: 花時間**。

文章明確指出聚斂性思考模式的焦點在於**快速**，所以花時間與其重點相反。 其他選項 (A, C, D) 都與文章描述的聚斂性思考模式的特點相符。
"
根據文章，以下哪一項不被認為是微表情？,"根據文章，微表情指的是「僅維持幾毫秒的臉部動作」。選項中：

*   **A: 說話時眼神飄忽** - 雖然可能與說謊有關，但並非必然的臉部動作，且時間長度不定。
*   **B: 皺眉** - 是臉部肌肉的動作，可能持續較短時間，符合微表情的定義。
*   **C: 快速眨眼** - 是臉部動作，可能持續極短時間，符合微表情的定義。
*   **D: 豎起大拇指** - 是手勢，不是臉部表情。

因此，**D: 豎起大拇指** 最不符合微表情的定義。

所以答案是 **D**
"
有關微表情解讀的說法，以下哪個敘述不正確？,"The incorrect statement is **C: 除了臉部表情，也可以解讀語言 (Besides facial expressions, language can also be interpreted)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage focuses on microexpressions (facial expressions) and their role in detecting deception and assessing sincerity.** While Oliver Sacks' example mentions understanding sincerity even without comprehending the *content* of the speech, the passage *doesn't* suggest that language itself is being interpreted as a microexpression. Sacks' point is that sincerity is communicated non-verbally.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: 錄影記錄有助於重大進展 (Video recording helps with significant progress):** The passage explicitly states that video recording has led to major findings in understanding microexpressions.
*   **B: 正確的解讀可以發現說謊 (Correct interpretation can detect lies):** This is a core claim made in the passage.
*   **D: 它可以幫助評估誠信 (It can help assess integrity):** This aligns with the idea that microexpressions can reveal a speaker's true feelings and thus their sincerity."
以下哪項文藝復興的成果變得更重要？ ,"The correct answer is **B: 知識傳播**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes a shift in how knowledge is handled.** It moves away from individual memory and rote memorization (""recalling texts"") towards a new emphasis on *how* knowledge is learned and spread.
* **Option B aligns directly with this emphasis.** The passage states the Renaissance brought about major changes to the ways knowledge was learned *and spread*.
* **Option A (Individual Memory) is contradicted.** The passage says it becomes *less* important.
* **Option C (Text Recalling) is mentioned, but in a negative context.** The passage says the focus shifts *away* from simple recall.
* **Option D (Obtaining Information) is related, but not as directly as option B.** Knowledge transmission is the process of making information available and disseminating it.

Therefore, the Renaissance made the *spread* of knowledge more important than simply memorizing facts.
"
以下哪項文藝復興的成果不再受到重視？,"正確答案是 **A: 個別回憶**

**理由：**

*   段落P指出，文藝復興後，「壓力不再存在於個別的回憶中，而變得比較關注在憶起文字的能力」。這表示文藝復興的成果之一是 **個別回憶不再受到重視**，取而代之的是對文字的回憶。
*   選項B（獲得知識）和D（資訊散播）顯然在文藝復興中變得更加重要，而非不再受到重視。
*   選項C（文本回憶）則是在文藝復興後才變得更受重視，而非不再受到重視。

因此，選項A最符合段落P的描述。"
以下哪一項不反映使用網際網路維持人際關係的動機？,"The passage mentions ""socialization,"" ""personal involvement,"" and ""ongoing relationships"" as motivations for using the internet. Options B, C, and D all reflect aspects of these motivations. However, Option A is more oriented toward business. Therefore, the answer is:

**A: 商業網絡**
"
以下哪一項不反映因個人參與而使用網際網路的動機？,"The passage highlights ""personal involvement"" and ""ongoing relationships"" as new motivational aspects for using the internet. Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: Checking out recipes:** While useful, this is primarily about information seeking, not necessarily personal involvement.

*   **B: Posting on online forums:** This directly involves engaging with others, sharing opinions, and building relationships. It reflects personal involvement.

*   **C: Researching health supplements:** Similar to checking out recipes, this involves information seeking.

*   **D: Managing finances:** This involves personal control and responsibility over one's money. It's a goal-oriented activity that emphasizes personal involvement and responsibility.

**Therefore, the best answer is A: Checking out recipes.** It's the least related to personal involvement compared to the other options."
西歐什麼時候停止重度依賴外來影響，並開始發展自己的風格？,"The correct answer is **A: 中世紀末期左右 (Middle Ages' end)**.

The passage states: ""中世紀末期，西歐開始發展獨特的風格"" (Middle Ages' end, Western Europe began to develop a unique style).
"
使用鈕扣來固定衣服是哪個時期的產物？ ,"根據文章，十字軍成員開始用釦子固定衣服。因此，正確答案是：

**C: 十字軍東征**
"
根據文章，以下哪個被認為是環境問題可行的長期解決方案？,"The correct answer is **C: 確定問題的原因 (Determine the cause of the problems)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that ""if we want more than temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problems and solve them thoroughly."" This directly supports option C.
*   The passage criticizes approaches like environmental movements and activism as being akin to ""treating the symptoms,"" implying they are not long-term solutions. This rules out options B and D.
*   While the passage mentions ""wasteful lifestyles"" as a contributing factor, it doesn't explicitly state that boycotting luxury is *the* primary long-term solution. Option A focuses on one symptom, not the root cause.

Therefore, C is the best answer because it aligns with the passage's emphasis on addressing the fundamental reasons behind environmental problems."
根據文章，以下哪個解決方案不被視為環境問題的症狀治療？,"正確答案是 **B: 徹底解決問題的根本原因**

文章明確指出，投身環保運動（包含參與行動主義）和以更環保的方式生活都只是“頭痛醫頭，腳痛醫腳”的暫時性解決方案，也就是在治療症狀而非根本原因。 文章也提到人類浪費的生活方式是問題的加劇因素，所以評論奢侈生活方式，可能只是針對某個表象。

只有“徹底解決問題的根本原因”被文章認為是超越症狀治療的解決方案。
"
據說歐洲第一場以權力平衡為核心議題而非宗教背景的戰爭發生在哪個國家？,"The correct answer is **D: 西班牙 (Spain)**.

The passage explicitly states that the War of the Spanish Succession was the first war with the balance of power as a central issue.
"
哪場戰爭有時被描述為最後一場「宗教戰爭」？,"正確答案是 **A: 三十年戰爭**。

P 段落明確指出，三十年戰爭成為最後一場宗教戰爭。
"
根據文章，以下天主教教會哪個方面未受到詳細審查？,"The correct answer is **B: 是否應修改宗教的主要信條 (Whether the main tenet of religion should be modified)**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 教會內的財富分配是否恰當 (Whether the distribution of wealth within the church was appropriate):** The passage explicitly mentions that people questioned whether the church was following its tenet of using wealth to help the poor.
*   **C: 權力集中於教會 (Concentration of power within the church):** The passage states ""the concentration of this power and money led many to question whether the church was truly following this tenet.""
*   **D: 是否遵循教會的主要信條 (Whether it was following the main tenet of the church):** This is the central issue raised in the passage - people questioned if the church was living up to its principle of helping the poor.

The passage focuses on the *application* of the existing religious tenets, not whether those tenets themselves should be changed. Therefore, option B is the aspect *not* under scrutiny."
根據文章，誰在凡爾賽宮被謀殺？,"正確答案是 **D: 一名衛兵**。

文章中提到，""一名暴徒成員甚至在驚恐的皇后面前揮舞著王室衛兵的頭顱，該衛兵在凡爾賽宮被殺。"" 這明確指出，一名王室衛兵在凡爾賽宮被殺。
"
暴徒沒有強迫國王和皇后做出以下哪種行為？,"根據提供的文字，暴徒強迫國王和皇后：

*   打開他們的馬車車窗 (A)
*   突然離開凡爾賽宮 (B)
*   返回巴黎之旅 (D)

但文字描述的是一名暴徒在皇后面前揮舞王室衛兵的頭顱，這暗示皇后**觀看**了衛兵被斬首後的頭顱，但並沒有直接表明暴徒強迫她**觀看衛兵被斬首**的過程。

所以答案是：

C: 觀看衛兵被斬首的場面
"
以下哪一項不是英國非傳統海戰的成果？,"The correct answer is **C: 國際法得到了修改**. Here's why:

*   **A: 德國希望採用類似的戰術:** The passage explicitly states, ""德國因此認為他們的無限制潛艇戰也不會招致強烈反彈."" This shows the British actions influenced Germany's decision-making regarding its own naval warfare tactics.

*   **B: 將無關的船隻置身危險之中:** The passage states, ""英國在國際海域布置水雷，以防止任何船隻進入整個海域，甚至危害到中立船隻."" This directly indicates that neutral, non-military ships were endangered by the British strategy.

*   **D: 無法獲得關鍵物資:** The passage states, ""這套切斷必要軍事及民生物資供應的戰略確實奏效."" This confirms that the blockade effectively restricted Germany's access to essential resources.

*   **C: 國際法得到了修改:** The passage mentions that the British actions violated international law, but it doesn't say that international law was *modified* as a result. The lack of strong reactions doesn't equate to a formal change in the law itself."
以下哪個陳述並未正確描述英國對德國的海上封鎖？,"正確答案是 **D: 它確保中立國的船舶不會受到危害**

文章中明確指出英國的海上封鎖 *危害到中立船隻*，因此選項 D 與文章內容不符，是唯一未正確描述英國海上封鎖的選項。
"
根據文章，哪種人最有可能被診斷出患有多發性硬化症？,"The correct answer is **A: 一位 32 歲的女性**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that MS is a major neurological disease for younger and middle-aged adults.
*   The passage also states that women are twice as likely to be diagnosed with MS as men.

Option A is the only choice that fits both criteria: a woman in the younger/middle-aged adult range.
"
根據文章，參與規律活動的人哪方面需要更多協助？,"The correct answer is **A: 負面疼痛感知 (Negative pain perception)**.

The passage states: ""那些進行規律活動的人在對於疼痛的負面感知即慢性疼痛及一般物理性動作所造成的不適感之間的區別，需要更多的協助。"" This directly translates to people who engage in regular activity needing more help with the negative perception of pain, specifically in distinguishing between chronic pain and discomfort caused by normal physical movement.
"
根據文章，擊劍通常是如何進行的？,"The correct answer is **D: 以決鬥形式進行**.

The passage states: ""這種運動主要以決鬥模式進行，由一名擊劍選手對決另一名選手。"" (This sport is primarily conducted in a duel format, with one fencer competing against another.)
"
根據文章，以下哪一個是體內中毒最強力的指標？,"The correct answer is **D: 一個處方藥藥瓶 (A prescription drug bottle)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""The best indication of internal poisoning may be discovering an open container of medicine or toxic household chemicals.""

While the other options (A, B, and C) describe symptoms, the passage explicitly says that symptoms like vomiting are too common to be a direct indicator of poisoning. The strongest clue, according to the passage, is finding evidence of a potential poison source. A prescription drug bottle, especially if open or empty, fits this description.
"
根據文章，評估傷者時適當的第一步是什麼？,"根據文章，評估傷者時適當的第一步是 **A: 觀察現場**。

文章明確指出，在檢查傷者之前，必須先觀察周邊環境，確保自己的安全。
"
以下哪一個陳述未正確反映檢查傷者的過程？,"正確答案是 **A: 不用擔心自己受傷**。

P 段落明確指出檢查傷者之前，確保自身安全是首要之務。 A 選項與這個觀點直接衝突，因此未正確反映檢查傷者的過程。 其他選項 B、C、D 都符合 P 段落的內容。
"
法國大革命促使哪些變革對勞工階級產生了重大影響？,"The best answer is **B: 關注重點從階級轉向才幹 (Focus shifted from class to talent)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage directly states:** ""...因為他們此時已不用階級來區分軍階，而是以才幹為基準 (because they no longer used class to distinguish military ranks, but based it on talent)."" This change directly impacts the laboring classes, as it opens up opportunities based on merit rather than birth.
* The passage also says ""各種職缺都開放給所有主動求職的男性，讓最有意願和成就者得以接掌 (All positions were open to any man actively seeking employment, allowing those who were most willing and accomplished to take over).""

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: 增加國家的支持度 (Increased state support):** While revolution *might* lead to this, the passage doesn't explicitly mention increased state support as a direct impact on the laboring classes.
*   **C: 採納了共和意識形態 (Adoption of republican ideology):** While mentioned in the passage, this is a broader political change. The question is about *significant impact on the laboring classes specifically*.
*   **D: 新的度量衡系統 (New system of measurement):** This is a social change, but it doesn't directly impact the laboring class in the way that the shift to meritocracy does."
法國大革命後，要在軍事和其他職業中取得成功，不太可能以什麼為基準？,"基於文章內容，法國大革命後，軍隊不再以階級來區分軍階，而是以才幹為基準。因此，在軍事和其他職業中取得成功，不太可能以 **B: 階級** 為基準。
"
根據文章，在已開發國家中，據說哪一項公共服務引起了最多不滿？,"The passage states: ""In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality and bridge collapses."" This implies that transportation systems receive significantly more complaints than water quality or bridge construction.

Therefore, the answer is **C: 大眾運輸 (Mass Transit)**.
"
根據文章，大眾運輸系統有什麼特點？,"The correct answer is **C: 常常被使用者的抱怨**.

The passage explicitly states that ""幾乎每一個人都抱怨運輸系統."" This directly supports option C.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage states the opposite – people complain about it.
*   **B:** The passage says that water quality receives fewer complaints, indicating the opposite.
*   **D:** The passage doesn't mention anything about transportation systems being free.
"
根據文章，由於難以預測司機的行為，因此難以衡量以下哪個項目？,"The correct answer is **D: 交通流量**.

Here's why:

*   The passage directly states: ""問題是，因為無法百分之百預測駕駛習慣，所以研究交通流量非常困難."" This translates to: ""The problem is, because it is impossible to predict driving habits 100%, it is very difficult to study traffic flow.""

The passage also mentions that relationships between traffic flow, density, and speed are used for road planning, design, and operation. However, the *difficulty* stems from the unpredictability of driver behavior specifically in the *study of traffic flow* itself."
以下哪項工具會用於展現交通流量？,"The correct answer is **D: 交通密度**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that traffic flow is defined by the relationship between three key features: flow, density, and speed.
*   The passage also mentions that these relationships are helpful in the ""planning, design, and operation of traffic facilities."" This implies that C (Road Design) can benefit from the tools to represent the traffic flow but cannot represent the traffic flow itself.
*   Option B (Driver behavior) is mentioned as a challenging aspect to predict exactly and thus not a tool used to represent traffic flow.
*   Option A (Road operations) is also mentioned as part of the facilities which can be planned using traffic flow representation tools, and thus is also not the tool itself.

Therefore, 交通密度 (traffic density) is one of the defined features used to represent traffic flow, making it the most direct and accurate answer."
赫雪和蔡司用什麼來植入他們的 DNA？ ,"正確答案是 **D: 病毒**

解釋：

* 段落提到 Hershey 和 Chase 利用噬菌體 (或稱病毒) 將 DNA 植入細菌中。
* 其他選項雖然在實驗中扮演一定角色，但病毒才是作為將 DNA 植入的載體。
"
突變是否能夠傳遞給後代，取決於以下哪一個因素？,"The correct answer is **A: 細胞是否為生殖系細胞**.

The passage explicitly states: ""只有生殖細胞系細胞中的突變會遺傳給子女"". The other options are described as affecting the cell that has the mutation, but not whether it is passed on.
"
根據文章所提供的資訊，突變的各種不同效果不依賴以下何者？,"根據文章，突變的不同效果取決於：

*   突變的種類
*   受影響遺傳物質的重要性
*   受影響細胞是否為生殖系細胞

因此，突變的不同效果**依賴**於選項 A, B, C, 和 D。

文章沒有說突變的效果**不依賴**於任何選項。因此，問題可能存在瑕疵。

然而，仔細審視選項，A、C、D都被文章明確提及。選項 B ""受影響的細胞是否為生殖系細胞"" 也是文章重點強調的決定因素。

如果一定要選一個**最不**相關的選項，我會選擇 **A: 有多少遺傳物質受到影響**。因為文章更側重於 *哪些* 遺傳物質受到影響 (重要性)，而非 *有多少*。

**然而，請注意這個問題可能存在瑕疵，因為文章暗示所有選項都對突變的效果有影響。**
"
以下哪個不是古代文化飼養山羊的原因？,"正確答案是 **C: 提供陪伴**。

段落中提到了古代文化飼養山羊是為了取得奶、毛、肉與皮。 並沒有提到任何關於陪伴的用途。
"
高爾夫球是用極少數的什麼達到目標？,"正確答案是 **B: 桿數**

段落 P 明確指出：「打完全場後，由以**最低桿數**，也就是最少揮桿次數進洞的球員贏得比賽。」
"
在高爾夫球場上，哪裡的草修剪得比較短？,"Correct answer is **B: 在果嶺上**.

The passage explicitly states ""球洞周圍的草割得較短，稱為果嶺"" which translates to ""The grass around the hole is cut shorter and is called the green.""
"
實驗的典型目的是什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 消除一個或多個可能的假設**.

The passage states: ""...實驗是能消除一個或多個假設的測試..."". This directly reflects the purpose of an experiment. While options B, C, and D are all related to science and scientific research, they are not the *typical* purpose of an experiment *itself*.
"
根據文章，以下何者不能幫助引領科學研究？,"根據文章，以下何者**不能**幫助引領科學研究？

* **文章重點：** 科學方法是主要途徑，但**不是唯一**途徑。問問題、觀察、排除假設（透過實驗）都可以引導科學研究。

分析選項：

* **A: 只靠科學方法：** 文章說科學方法是**主要**途徑，因此依靠科學方法是可以引領科學研究的。
* **B: 進行觀察：** 文章明確指出進行觀察可以引導科學研究。
* **C: 排除可能的假設：** 文章提到實驗可以排除假設，而排除假設可以引導科學研究。
* **D: 進行實驗：** 文章提到實驗可以引導科學研究。

因此，雖然科學方法是主要途徑，但如果題目問的是「不能」，正確答案是 **A: 只靠科學方法** 因為文章隱含著除了科學方法，還有其他方法可以引領科學研究。
"
根據文章，以下哪個對龍捲風的陳述不正確？,"The correct answer is **C: 大多數龍捲風持續超過三小時**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""龍捲風之中最猛烈的 2% 能持續超過 3 小時."" (The most violent 2% of tornadoes can last more than 3 hours.) This implies that the vast majority (the other 98%) last *less* than 3 hours.

The other options are all supported by the text:

*   A: 龍捲風能夠摧毀周圍的一切 (Tornadoes can destroy everything around them) - The passage says ""它們能夠摧毀所有它們所經之處的東西."" (They can destroy everything in their path.)
*   B: 龍捲風影響的範圍比其他風暴小 (Tornadoes affect a smaller area than other storms) - The passage states: ""龍捲風與其他猛烈的風暴相比，侵襲的範圍較小..."" (Tornadoes affect a smaller area compared to other violent storms...)
*   D: 有些龍捲風的風速可以達到每小時 300 英里 (Some tornadoes can reach speeds of 300 miles per hour) - The passage says: ""這些怪獸風暴的風速高達每小時 480 公里（每秒 133 公尺；每小時 300 英里）."" (These monster storms have winds of up to 480 kilometers per hour (133 meters per second; 300 miles per hour).)"
根據文章，以下哪個陳述正確描述了大多數龍捲風？,"The correct answer is **D: 它們能夠將樹木從地上拔起**

Here's why:

*   **A: 它們通常持續超過三小時:** The passage states that only the most violent 2% of tornadoes last longer than 3 hours, meaning the vast majority last for a shorter duration.
*   **B: 它們能夠產生每小時約480英里的風速:** The passage mentions that the most violent tornadoes can reach speeds up to 480 km/h (approximately 300 mph), not all tornadoes.
*   **C: 它們影響的範圍比其他風暴大:** The passage explicitly states that tornadoes affect a smaller area than other severe storms.
*   **D: 它們能夠將樹木從地上拔起:** The passage mentions that tornadoes ""can uproot trees,"" implying this is a general capability of tornadoes."
以下哪個是人類在 16 世紀開始做的事情？,"The correct answer is **D: 製造望遠鏡**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""But the first real telescopes were not made until the end of the 16th century in Europe."" This directly indicates that telescopes were first made in the 16th century.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 使用透鏡:** The passage says humans have used lenses for magnification ""for millennia."" This means they were using lenses long before the 16th century.
* **B: 放大物體:** Similar to using lenses, magnifying objects was done for thousands of years before the 16th century, thanks to the use of lenses.
* **C: 製造透鏡:** Again, the passage states that humans had been making lenses for millennia.
"
人類使用透鏡放大物體已經有多久了？,"The correct answer is **C: 數千年**.

The passage states: ""人類幾千年來一直在製造透鏡，並使用它的放大功能."" This directly answers the question of how long humans have been using lenses to magnify objects.
"
根據文章，關於穆罕默德的靈性修行或價值觀，他的洞穴說明了什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: He valued peace and solitude.**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Muhammad went to the cave to meditate and that the cave was isolated and offered a sense of seclusion. This strongly suggests he valued the peace and quiet necessary for spiritual reflection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Outside noise can help with meditation:** The passage emphasizes the cave's isolation, which is the opposite of suggesting that outside noise is helpful.
*   **C: He needed very little alone time:** Muhammad's consistent journey to the remote cave implies he needed significant alone time for his spiritual practices.
*   **D: He wanted to be seen and heard:** The description of the cave's secluded location directly contradicts this statement. He actively sought isolation."
根據文章，鐵最早是用來做什麼的？,"The correct answer is **D: 鐵軌**.

The passage states: ""但漸漸地，人們發現若鋪上鐵條，軌道效率較高。"" This means iron was first used to overlay the wooden tracks, making them more efficient rails.
"
根據文章，為什麼木輪被鐵輪取代？,"The correct answer is **D: 木輪受軌道上的鐵條磨損 (Wood wheels were worn down by the iron bars on the tracks)**.

The passage states: ""This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carts. Eventually, iron wheels replaced wooden wheels."" This directly indicates that the wear caused by the iron rails led to the replacement of wooden wheels with iron wheels.
"
根據文章，是什麼塑造了浪漫主義時期的個體？,"根據文章，塑造浪漫主義時期個體的是 **B: 地理**。

文章明確指出，「在浪漫主義的脈絡中，地理環境塑造了個體，且隨著時間的推移產生出與該地理環境相關的習俗和文化」。雖然風俗習慣和文化與地理有關，但最初的塑造力量是地理環境。
"
以下哪個陳述不反映科技決定論的普遍概念？ ,"正確答案是 **A: 科技對社會的影響是社會條件所決定的**

理由：

*   **題目說明：** 段落中提到科技決定論認為科技本身發展途徑比文化或政治因素影響更大，且科技會影響社會，而非受社會制約。
*   **選項分析：**
    *   A選項與科技決定論的核心概念直接矛盾，科技決定論認為科技影響社會，而不是受社會條件決定。
    *   B、C、D選項都符合科技決定論的普遍概念，因為科技決定論認為科技發展不受文化、政治影響，且科技本身對社會有內在影響。

因此，選項A是不符合科技決定論概念的陳述。"
根據文章，以下哪個選項與拉弓無關？,"The correct answer is **A: 柔和的聲音 (柔和的聲響)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that 下弓 (down bow), which involves drawing the bow, generally represents a stronger sound. It associates 上弓 (up bow) with a softer sound. The question specifically asks which option is **not** related to pulling the bow (down bow).

The other options **are** associated with pulling the bow (下弓):

*   **B: 看起來像訂書針的標記 (looks like a staple)**: The passage describes the down bow marking as looking like a staple.
*   **C: 強勁的聲音 (strong sound)**: The passage states that down bow markings typically indicate a strong sound.
*   **D: 從弓根開始 (starting from the frog)**: The passage says the down bow stroke begins at the frog (弓根).
"
根據文章，以下何者與柔和的聲音有關？,"The correct answer is **C: 像 V 字形的痕標記**

The passage states: ""上弓記號通常代表的是比較輕柔的聲響，而上弓標記長得像 V"" which translates to: ""Up-bow markings usually represent a softer sound, and up-bow markings look like a V.""
"
化石顯示，手最終適應了以下哪方面的主要用途？,"The correct answer is **A: 操作**

The passage states: ""兩百萬到三百萬年前的手骨化石，顯示從運動到操作，手部功能的轉變."" (Fossilized hand bones from two to three million years ago show a shift in hand function from locomotion to manipulation.) This directly indicates that hands adapted for manipulation.
"
以下何者正確描述了黑猩猩的指骨？ ,"The correct answer is **C: 用於負重**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""黑猩猩手和腳的尺寸與長度相當，反映了牠們的手在握拳行走時承受重量的作用"" (Chimpanzee hands and feet are similar in size and length, reflecting the role of their hands in bearing weight when knuckle-walking). This directly supports option C.
*   A: 比人類的指骨更直 (straighter than human finger bones): The passage says human finger bones are straighter, the opposite of this statement.
*   B: 手腳的指骨大小不同 (finger bones of hands and feet are different sizes): The passage says the hands and feet are similar in size.
*   D: 主要用於操作 (primarily used for manipulation): The passage focuses on the function of carrying weight.
"
天擇從哪個群體中刪除新的基因變異？,"The correct answer is **D: 顯性**.

The passage states: ""突變會增加新的基因變異，而天擇則會將其從**顯性**變異庫中移除。"" (Mutations increase new genetic variations, and natural selection removes them from the **dominant** variation pool.)
"
哪個過程負責增加基因變異？,"The correct answer is **C: 突變 (Mutation)**.

The passage states: ""突變會增加新的基因變異 (Mutations increase new genetic variations)."" The other options are not explicitly stated as increasing genetic variation.
"
根據文章中的資訊，靈長類動物應該攝取那些食物來解決「蛋白質問題」？,"根據文章，為了解決「蛋白質問題」，靈長類動物應該攝取：

*   **動物性食物 (螞蟻、白蟻、蛋)**，因為它們容易消化且提供優質蛋白。
*   **葉子和莢豆**，但需要經過烹調，文章暗示未烹調的豆類不好消化。

選項中，只有 **C: 蚱蜢** 屬於動物性食物，因此是符合文章描述的正確答案。選項 A、B 和 D 都是植物性食物，但文章指出未烹調的豆類不好消化。
因此正確答案是 **C**。"
根據文章，以下哪個問題不是因為缺乏必要胺基酸引起的？,"根據文章，缺乏必要胺基酸會導致：

* 生長不良
* 營養不良
* 死亡

文章提到葉子和莢豆未經烹煮難以消化，因此消化問題不是缺乏胺基酸直接引起的。

所以答案是 **A: 消化問題**
"
一個特定的次文化成員經常如何表明他們與該群體的關聯？,"The correct answer is **D: 使用有象徵形式的風格**.

The passage states: ""次文化的成員通常透過特殊、有象徵意義的形式彰顯他們的屬於該群體，其中包括穿著打扮、行為舉止及暗語的使用。"" (Members of subcultures often demonstrate their belonging to the group through special, symbolic forms, including dress, behavior, and the use of secret languages.)

This directly supports option D. The other options are incorrect because they describe conformity to mainstream society, which is the opposite of what subcultures typically do.
"
根據本文所提出的理論，某少數民族具有從事威脅行為的刻板印象，認同該民族的兒童會發生什麼事？,"根據文章提出的理論，如果某少數民族具有從事威脅行為的刻板印象，認同該民族的兒童得知這個刻板印象後，會更有可能從事威脅行為。 因此答案是 **B: 孩子將更有可能從事威脅行為**。

文章中提到，兒童得知針對其種族的負面刻板印象後，表現會符合該刻板印象。 類似的，如果一個族群被認為有威脅性，認同該族群的兒童可能會受到影響，進而表現出威脅行為。
"
根據文章，孩子對種族刻板印象的了解可能會影響以下何者？,"The correct answer is **B: 他們的行為** (Their behavior).

The passage explicitly states that racial stereotypes can influence children's behavior. The example given illustrates this point directly: children who identify with a minority group associated with negative academic stereotypes tend to perform worse academically after becoming aware of the stereotype.
"
根據文章，以下哪一項不太可能與野孩子的教養一致？,"根據文章，野孩子因為缺乏社會化，會表現出與正常人不同的行為。

*   **A: 獨立生活** - 雖然他們可能獨自生活或在野外生存，但這並不是教育或教養的結果，而是生存的必要。

*   **B: 強大的會話能力** - 文章提到野孩子缺乏社會化，因此不太可能發展出強大的會話能力。這與他們缺乏與人互動的機會有關。

*   **C: 隱居傾向** - 因為缺乏與人互動和社會化，他們更有可能傾向於隱居。

*   **D: 社交焦慮** - 因為缺乏與人互動和社會化，他們更有可能害怕或冷漠地對待人類，這可能導致社交焦慮。

因此，最不可能與野孩子的教養一致的是 **B: 強大的會話能力**。
"
根據文章，以下哪項何者正確描述了兒童的野獸行為？,"The correct answer is **B: 野獸行為可能源於缺乏社會化**.

Here's why:

*   **P** 提到「常用於說明社會化重要性的一種方法，是舉幾則孩童在成長過程中遭受忽視、厄運或蓄意虐待，因而未獲得成人賦予社會化過程的不幸案例」。 這表明缺乏社會化與所謂的「野獸行為」有關。
*   **A** 是不正確的。 雖然文章提到父母可能因為孩子有缺陷而遺棄他們，但這不是野獸行為的主要原因。
*   **C** 是不正確的。 監禁只是野孩子可能面臨的一種情況，還有其他原因，例如被遺棄或被動物撫養。
*   **D** 是不正確的。 雖然父母可能會因為孩子的智力缺陷而遺棄他們，但這並不是野獸行為的唯一或主要原因。"
根據文章，以下哪項做法不符合自給農業？,"The correct answer is **B: 生產食物出售給他人 (Producing food to sell to others)**.

Here's why:

*   **Self-sufficient agriculture (自給自足式農業)**, by definition, focuses on producing enough food for the farmer and their family. Selling the produce to others indicates a move beyond self-sufficiency towards a market-oriented approach.
*   Option A (以滿足農民家庭需求的產量為重點) is a key aspect of self-sufficient agriculture.
*   Option C (注重高產量而非先進技術) aligns with the description of self-sufficient agriculture as a simpler system that does not rely on modern agricultural technologies to produce high yields.
*   Option D (採購當地農民的種子) aligns with the description of self-sufficient agriculture retaining and using the seeds of indigenous crops.
"
下列何者正確描述了自給農業的作法？,"正確答案是 **D: 部分國家的農民仍在使用這種方法**

原因：

*   **A: 是一個完全有機的系統:** 段落中說 *通常* 採行有機耕種，但並非所有自給自足式農業都是有機的。
*   **B: 使用獨特的技術來最大化收穫量:** 段落提到採用相對簡單的技術增加產量，與「獨特」和「最大化」的說法不符。
*   **C: 允許農民在他們的地區分享自己的農作物:** 自給自足式農業的重點是生產足夠農民和家庭使用的作物，不一定有剩餘可供分享。
*   **D: 部分國家的農民仍在使用這種方法:** 段落中明確指出「許多開發中國家依舊如此」。

因此，選項D最符合段落中所描述的自給自足式農業。"
參觀博物館屬於哪種旅遊類型？,"根據文章內容：

*   **休閒旅遊：** 到與日常生活環境不同的地方放鬆玩樂，常見地點包括海灘、主題公園和露營區。
*   **文化旅遊：** 造訪特定地點的目的是為了瞭解其歷史及文化，例如參觀地標或聚焦於特定地區。

參觀博物館的目的是為了瞭解其歷史及文化，因此屬於 **文化旅遊**。

所以答案是 **C: 文化旅遊**。
"
根據文章，下列何者可能是休閒遊客優先考慮的事？,"正確答案是 **B: 離開他們的日常生活休息一下**

理由如下：

*   文章中提到「休閒旅遊。 就是去一些跟日常生活環境截然不同的地方，放鬆玩樂。」這清楚表明了休閒遊客的主要目的是從日常生活中解脫，尋求放鬆和娛樂。

其他選項錯誤的原因：

*   A: 沉浸於當地文化中 - 這是文化之旅的目的，而非休閒旅遊。
*   C: 造訪重要的地標 - 文化之旅或歷史旅行可能會包含造訪地標，但不是休閒旅遊的重點。
*   D: 了解一個地方的歷史 - 這是文化之旅的目的，而非休閒旅遊。
"
文中提到什麼可以幫助減輕當地教堂對變革的恐懼？,"The correct answer is **A: 記住創業行為的成功案例**.

The passage states: ""In this context, recalling past entrepreneurial actions and successes can help people be more open to new changes and directions for the local church. This success story can lessen the fear of change while making people more willing to accept future changes.""
"
根據文章，瞭解自己的歷史有什麼幫助？,"The best answer is **C: 在組織中找到自己的位置 (Find your place in the organization)**.

While the passage touches on all the points mentioned in the options, the most direct and explicitly stated benefit of understanding history is finding your place in the organization.  The passage states: ""儘管了解一個人的歷史並不代表了解文化，但這至少可以讓人理解他們在組織的歷史中處在什麼樣的位置上 (Although understanding a person's history does not mean understanding the culture, it can at least help people understand where they stand in the history of the organization).""
Here's why the other options are less directly supported:

*   **A: 減少對變革的恐懼 (Reduce fear of change):** While the passage mentions that remembering past successes can reduce fear of change, this is more about the overall impact of remembering the past and less about the direct result of understanding *your own* history.
*   **B: 強化價值觀 (Strengthen values):** Understanding history helps in discovering the organization's values, but it doesn't explicitly say it strengthens *your own* values.
*   **D: 改善創業行為 (Improve entrepreneurial behavior):** The passage mentions recalling past entrepreneurial actions, but this is to encourage acceptance of changes, not necessarily to improve future entrepreneurial behavior."
下列哪種說法正確描述了後現代學習方法？,"正確答案是 **D: 學習中沒有定則**

**原因：**

*   P 段落一開始就明確指出 ""後現代的學習方法讓人能擺脫定則"" 和 ""學習的良方不只一種""。 這直接表明後現代學習方法的核心概念是不存在固定或標準的學習規則。

其他選項都不符合 P 段落的觀點：

*   A 和 C 都認為某些學習經驗或方式更好，這與 P 段落強調 ""沒有什麼好事是特別要學習"" 相悖。
*   B 雖然提到了經驗，但重點放在 ""我們相信我們將會經歷的事情""，這與 P 段落中 ""學習發生在學習者與所呈現的知識間的經歷之中"" 的重點不同。 P 段落更強調學習過程中學習者與知識之間的互動。
"
下列哪種說法並未正確反映後現代學習方法？,"正確答案是 **B: 某些學習經驗應優先考慮於其他學習經驗**

理由如下:

*   **後現代學習的核心理念是多元性，沒有唯一的正確學習方式或需要優先考慮的學習經驗。** 段落中明確指出「學習的良方不只一種」，這與選項 B 相矛盾。
*   選項 A（有多種學習方式可以學習資訊）、C（學習經驗依賴於學習者和提供的知識）和 D（可能永遠不會應用的知識仍然值得學習）都符合後現代學習的原則，並且在段落中有所體現。

因此，選項 B 是唯一與後現代學習方法理念不符的選項。"
在正常睡眠期間刻意喚醒後，下列哪些會干擾睡眠中斷的過程？,"根據原文，睡眠中斷的定義是在短時間內（10-60分鐘後）重新入睡。

*   **A: 閱讀一個半小時後再入睡** 超過了60分鐘的時限，會干擾睡眠中斷的過程。
*   **B: 使用浴室後馬上回床上** 符合短時間內重新入睡的條件。
*   **C: 關掉床頭的鬧鐘，二十分鐘後再入睡** 符合短時間內重新入睡的條件。
*   **D: 醒來喝床頭櫃上瓶子裡的水** 符合短時間內重新入睡的條件。

因此，正確答案是：

**A**
"
下列哪個不是關於睡眠中斷的正確描述？,"根據提供的文章，選項 D 是不正確的描述。

文章指出，睡眠中斷的目标是醒来后在短时间内（10-60 分钟）重新入睡，而不是两个小时。
"
當大腦嘗試更頻繁地做清醒夢時，什麼東西會增加？,"The passage states: ""清醒夢增加了快速動眼期狀態的間隔時間 (Lucid dreaming increases the length of REM state intervals).""

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: 快速動眼期的間隔時間 (REM state intervals)**.
"
下列哪一項是頻繁做清醒夢可能對身體產生的負面影響？,"根據文章，清醒夢會增加快速動眼期狀態的間隔時間，而快速動眼期是身體修復的階段。如果快速動眼期每晚發生的次數降至過低，就會產生問題。

因此，正確答案是：

*   **B: 每晚的快速動眼期減少**

因為清醒夢的頻繁發生導致快速動眼期階段的時間或次數減少。"
根據文章，傳統團隊和虛擬團隊有何相似之處？,"The correct answer is **A: 兩個團隊都被期望在同一水準上表現**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""虛擬團隊必須遵守跟傳統團隊一樣的品質標準，但是有細微的差異"" (Virtual teams must adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but with subtle differences). This directly supports option A.

Let's examine why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 兩個團隊在日常工作中都有不同程度的自主權** - The passage states that virtual teams have *more* autonomy than traditional teams, not that both have varying degrees.
*   **C: 兩個團隊都向一個無形的管理團隊報告** - Only virtual teams have the unique element of reporting to an ""invisible management team.""
*   **D: 兩個團隊都在相同時區運作** - The passage suggests the opposite - virtual teams *may* operate across different time zones, implying traditional teams are more likely to be in the same time zone."
根據文章，關於實體團隊和虛擬團隊，以下哪個說法不正確？,"Let's analyze each option based on the passage:

*   **A: 傳統團隊通常被要求的標準更高** The passage states that virtual teams must adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but with subtle differences. It doesn't say that traditional teams are held to *higher* standards. This statement is likely incorrect.
*   **B: 虛擬團隊通常充當傳統團隊的聯絡窗口** The passage explicitly states: ""Virtual team members often are the point of contact for physical teams they are coordinating with."" This statement is correct.
*   **C: 傳統團隊比虛擬團隊自主權較少** The passage states: ""They [virtual team members] often have more autonomy than traditional team members"". This implies traditional teams have less autonomy. This statement is correct.
*   **D: 不同的時區可以使虛擬團隊受益** The passage implies that different time zones *affect* virtual teams and can impact how local management understands them. The word ""benefit"" may be misleading, but this answer is more related to the text than other possible answers.

Therefore, the incorrect statement is **A**.

**Final Answer: A**"
以下哪一項不是內容理論所關注的內容？,"正確答案是 **A: 成年後具體化的新慾望**

**解釋：**

*   **內容理論的核心**，是找出讓人心動或吸引他們的東西。 這些理論認為人們有一些**需求或渴望，在長大成人的過程中內化了**。
*   這些理論探討**是什麼讓某些人想要某些東西**，以及在他們的環境中，**是什麼讓他們想做或不做某些事**。

選項 A 提到的「成年後具體化的新慾望」可能是一種結果，但並非內容理論 *直接關注* 的核心。 內容理論更關注**根本的需求和渴望**，以及它們如何**影響個體的動機和行為**。
選項 B、C、D 都直接符合內容理論的範疇。"
以下哪項不是三分法法則的對象？,"正確答案是 **A: 為主題的可能位置建立基準線**。

理由如下：

*   **P 段落說明了三分法的目的和效果：**
    *   **創造活力 (B):** 三分法有助於創造視覺上的趣味和動態感。
    *   **保持井然有序 (D):** 三分法提供了一個框架，使構圖更有結構。
    *   **將主題保持在特定且有效的位置 (C):** 三分法建議將主體放置在三分線的交點上，以達到更佳的效果。

*   **A 選項描述了**建立基準線，雖然與構圖有關，但不是三分法直接應用的目標。三分法更著重於利用這些線條和交點來**放置**主題，而不是**建立**基準線本身。
"
以下哪一項並非描述 35 公釐的攝影格式？,"The correct answer is **C: 與許多常見格式具有不同的長寬比**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 仍在生產中** - The passage states ""...It continues to be produced to this day..."" This is TRUE.
*   **B: 是數位相機所採用的格式** - The passage states ""...digital camera sensor dimensions inherited its aspect ratio."" This is TRUE.
*   **C: 與許多常見格式具有不同的長寬比** - The passage states ""...Many common formats (such as APS advanced photo system format) are either equal to or close to this aspect ratio."" This is FALSE.
*   **D: 是世界上最常見的格式** - The passage states ""...the most prevalent still photographic format in the world is 35mm..."" This is TRUE.

Therefore, option C is the only statement that is not a description of the 35mm photographic format according to the passage."
根據文章，隨著製造商提高鏡頭生產品質，變焦鏡頭得到了哪些改善？,"The correct answer is **C: 它們的照片品質與固定焦距的鏡頭相似**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""隨著鏡片製造商的鏡片生產達到更高水準，這已不再成為問題。 這已能使變焦鏡頭拍出與定焦鏡頭不相上下的照片品質。"" This directly indicates improved image quality to match prime lenses due to better manufacturing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 它們有更高的鏡頭速度:** The passage explicitly states that zoom lenses typically have *lower* maximum aperture (speed) than prime lenses.
*   **B: 它們在低光源條件下更易於使用:** While improved image quality might indirectly help, the primary issue in low light is the smaller aperture of zoom lenses, which the passage points out remains a problem.
*   **D: 它們比定焦鏡頭具有較少的焦點複雜度:** The passage mentions that zoom lenses require more complex design and more lens elements than prime lenses, and this hasn't changed. The improvement is in *image quality* despite the complexity."
根據文章中的資訊，何時使用變焦鏡頭可能會比定焦鏡頭更好呢？,"正確答案是：**C: 如果不想在較暗的環境中使用閃光燈**

**理由：**

*   文章指出「變焦鏡頭的另一缺點是鏡頭的最大光圈（速度）通常較低。這就使得平價的變焦鏡頭在低光源、無閃光燈的環境中難以使用。」
*   這句話的反推就是：如果不想在較暗的環境中使用閃光燈，平價變焦鏡頭是不好的選擇，因此，如果需要在這種環境下拍攝，且不使用閃光燈，定焦鏡頭可能會更好。文章雖然沒有直接說 *何時* 使用變焦鏡頭更好，但它說明了變焦鏡頭的弱點，暗示了定焦鏡頭在特定情況下是更好的選擇。

**為什麼其他選項不正確：**

*   **A: 如果最大光圈值是優先考慮因素：** 文章明確說明變焦鏡頭的最大光圈通常較低，所以這不是使用變焦鏡頭的好時機。
*   **B: 如果想使用較少的鏡頭元件：** 文章指出，變焦鏡頭需要更多的鏡片元件，所以這也不是使用變焦鏡頭的理由。
*   **D: 如果正在尋找更多的焦點複雜度：** 焦點複雜度是變焦鏡頭的缺點，沒有人會專門追求缺點。"
以下哪一項不是神秘主義的正確描述？,"根據文章的描述，選項 D 錯誤地描述了神秘主義。文章明確指出，神秘主義與其他宗教信仰不同，因為它強調尋求直接的個人體驗。 因此，正確答案是：

**D: 強調尋求直接的個人體驗與許多其他形式的宗教信仰和崇拜差不多**
"
根據文章，以下哪一項不是神秘主義的重點？,"正確答案是 **B: 透過共享的社群體驗追求洞察力**。

文章強調的是 *個人* 對於神性實相的直接體驗和意識狀態，而非透過社群共享的體驗。選項 A, C, D 都直接在文章中有提到。
"
根據文章，哪個族群可能開創了農業社會？,"The correct answer is **D: 來自大陸的毛利人**.

The passage states: ""該理論隨後確立一個觀點，認為毛利人乘坐大艦隊，自玻里尼西亞開始遷徙，然後從莫里奧里人手中奪取紐西蘭，並建立一個農業社會。"" This sentence directly links the mainland Maori (those who migrated in the ""great fleet"") to the establishment of an agricultural society.
"
根據文章，獵殺恐鳥的群體是哪個地方的第一批居民？,"根據文章，長期以來人們相信獵殺恐鳥的族群是**B: 紐西蘭**的第一批居民。
"
在哪種情況下，使用摺紙的淨土法會對折紙者有益？,"The correct answer is **D: 折紙者只在之前試過一兩次**.

Here's why:

*   淨土 (Pureland) 折紙 is designed for beginners or those with limited dexterity. If someone has only tried origami a few times, they are likely a beginner.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 折紙者喜歡一次多褶:** 淨土 (Pureland) 折紙 restricts to only one fold at a time, so someone who likes multiple folds at once would not benefit from this method.
*   **B: 折紙者有進階的動作技能:** Those with advanced motor skills would likely find 淨土 (Pureland) 折紙 too restrictive.
*   **C: 折紙者正在創作需要反摺的摺紙作品:** 淨土 (Pureland) 折紙 does not allow reverse folds, so it would not be suitable for a project requiring them."
以下哪個不是淨土摺紙的正確描述？,"根據文章，淨土摺紙是為了幫助摺紙新手或較不靈活的摺紙練習者設計的。因此，選項 A ""它是專為有經驗的折紙者設計的"" 與文章內容不符，是錯誤的描述。

所以答案是 A。
"
根據文章，哪個地點與印度河流域文明無關？,"The correct answer is **A: 哈拉帕**.

Here's why:

*   **哈拉帕** is mentioned as the name of the first discovered site of the civilization, and some scholars use it as an alternative name for the entire civilization. Therefore, it's related.

*   **薩拉斯瓦蒂河** is mentioned as a river some scholars believe the civilization also existed along. Therefore, it's related.

*   **阿富汗東北部所有地區** The passage states that the civilization covered parts of northeastern Afghanistan. Therefore, it is related.

*   **現代巴基斯坦的大部分地區** The passage states that the civilization covered most of modern-day Pakistan. Therefore, it is related."
文中沒有提到以下何者為青銅時代文明可能的名稱？,"The correct answer is **D: 印度河谷文明 (Indus Valley Civilization)**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 哈拉帕文明 (Harappan Civilization):** The passage explicitly states that some scholars use this name based on the first excavated site.
*   **B: 印度-薩拉斯瓦蒂文明 (Indus-Saraswati Civilization):** The passage mentions this as another proposed name, suggesting it's a possibility.
*   **C: 印度河流域文明 (Indus River Valley Civilization):** The passage introduces this as the primary name based on the civilization's location in the Indus River Valley.
*   **D: 印度河谷文明 (Indus Valley Civilization):** Although the names 印度河流域文明 (Indus River Valley Civilization) and 印度河谷文明 (Indus Valley Civilization) appear similar in English, the question is asking what is **NOT** mentioned as a *possible* name.

Therefore, even though it's closely related to the discussed name, **印度河谷文明 (Indus Valley Civilization)** is the best answer since it is not mentioned in the passage as an alternative name considered by scholars."
根據文章，以下何者產生了長期效益？,"The correct answer is **A: 與他人合作 (Cooperating with others)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""希望多數人終將明白他們長期的最佳選擇是與他人合作 (Hopefully most people will eventually realize that their best long-term option is to cooperate with others)."" This directly supports the idea that cooperation produces long-term benefits.
"
根據文章，如果某人著重於眼前的效益，他們可能會優先考慮以下哪項？,"The passage states: ""cooperation inevitably involves the fact that selfish actions will always gain more in the short term.""

The question asks what someone focused on short-term benefits would prioritize.

Therefore, the answer is **D: 自私 (Selfishness)**.
"
根據文章，誰支付了很大一部分戰爭費用？,"The correct answer is **D: 菲律賓人民**.

The passage states that the Philippine people were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime, which then covered most of the government expenses, including the war expenses.
"

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the era of the Knights Templar (11th-13th centuries) is called the ""High Middle Ages"".
*   It also explicitly says the ""High Middle Ages"" followed the ""Early Middle Ages""."

在羅馬帝國，醫生和外科醫生沒有提到以下哪種醫療或手術？,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: 使用各種鎮靜劑治療創傷後壓力症候群**.

"
根據文章，以下哪個選項不是羅馬帝國醫療領域進步的原因？,"根據文章，以下選項不是羅馬帝國醫療領域進步的原因：

**C: 建立學習型醫院**

文章提到了醫療隊的成立、帝國軍國主義性質促使的醫療需求、皇帝招募醫生，以及醫生們掌握的醫學知識和技術 (鎮定劑、截肢術等)。但文章中**沒有提到羅馬帝國建立學習型醫院**。

因此，正確答案是 **C**。
"
視力的能力取決於什麼？,"The best answer is **A: 視覺系統的感覺器官**.

The passage states: ""P: 視力，或視物的能力，來自視覺系統的感覺器官或眼睛。""  This directly answers the question of what vision comes from.

While the other options are mentioned in the passage, they describe *characteristics* of vision and the visual system, rather than the fundamental *source* of vision. For example:

*   **B: 生物體的需求:** This explains the *complexity* of the eye varies, not the source of vision itself.
*   **C: 對某些波長的敏感度:** This describes a *property* of the eye, not its source.
*   **D: 不同程度的視力:** This describes *variation* in vision, not the fundamental source of vision itself.

Therefore, A is the most accurate and direct answer based on the given text.
"
生物體之間的眼睛結構變化取決於什麼？,"The passage states: ""The complexity of the different structures depends on the organism's requirements."" Therefore, the correct answer is **B: 生物體的要求 (organism's requirements)**.
"
根據文章，關於錫克教的陳述，何者沒有正確描述該宗教？,"The correct answer is **B: 上師是錫克教特有的基本面向**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 錫克教是印度教傳統中宗派分裂的結果** - The passage states: ""its origins lie in the 15th century in the Punjab region from a splinter group from the Hindu tradition."" This aligns with the information in the passage.
*   **C: 在該宗教創始人古魯那奈克之後，有九位大師跟隨** - The passage states: ""This religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469–1539). After him came nine successive Gurus."" This matches the provided information.
*   **D: 錫克教的某些傳統源自於印度教** - The passage states: ""While they acknowledge roots and traditions from Hinduism..."" This supports the statement.
*   **B: 上師是錫克教特有的基本面向** - The passage says: ""The Guru is the basis of all Indian faiths, but in Sikhism, the Guru constitutes the very core of the faith."" This statement indicates that although the Guru is a fundamental aspect of Sikhism, the concept of the Guru is **not unique** to Sikhism. The passage says it is the basis of *all* Indian faiths. Therefore, this statement is the inaccurate description of the religion."
根據文章，以下哪一項被認為是錫克教信仰體系的核心面向？,"The correct answer is **A: 上師的概念 (上師的概念)**.

The passage states: ""上師是所有印度信仰的基礎，但在錫克教裡，上師構成了整個信仰的重要核心 (Gurus are fundamental to all Indian faiths, but in Sikhism, the Guru forms the important core of the entire faith)."" This directly supports that the concept of the Guru is a core aspect of the Sikh faith system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 印度教傳統 (Hindu traditions):** While the passage mentions Sikhism originated from Hindu traditions, it also stresses that Sikhs view their faith as distinct.
*   **C: 拒絕承認其他印度宗教 (Rejection of other Indian religions):** The passage doesn't suggest a rejection of other Indian religions, only a distinction between Sikhism and Hinduism.
*   **D: 講旁遮普語 (Speaking Punjabi):** While Punjabi is mentioned in the context of the term ""Gurmat,"" it is not identified as a core aspect of the *belief system* itself."
根據文章，注意力缺失症的孩子可能難以專注於哪些事情？,"The correct answer is **A: 學校作業**.

"
根據文章，為什麼注意力缺失症的孩子傾向於從事危險行為？,"The correct answer is **D: 刺激他們的大腦**.

The passage states that children with ADHD need to ""做出危險的行為、牽扯進打架並挑戰權威""才能刺激大腦.

根據文章中的資訊，以下哪一項不是鷹架式學習的例子？,"根據文章，鷹架式教學是一種輔助學習者經歷新學習體驗的方式。重點在於提供支援，幫助學習者完成他們獨自難以完成的任務。

*   **A: 電腦遊戲開始時的教學:** 這提供了遊戲機制的逐步指導，屬於鷹架的一種。
*   **B: SAT 輔導老師:** 輔導老師會提供策略、指導和練習，協助學生準備考試，屬於鷹架。
*   **C: 獨立自學課程:** 這種課程通常需要學習者高度自主，缺少即時的反饋和支持，因此比較不屬於鷹架式學習。
*   **D: 小聯盟教練:** 教練提供指導、訓練和反饋，幫助球員學習和進步，屬於鷹架。

因此，答案是 **C: 獨立自學課程**。
"
關於鷹架式學習的概念，以下哪一項描述不正確？,"The correct answer is **C: 它也被稱為專題式學習**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that scaffolding is *not* a learning method but rather a support system.
*   The passage also says scaffolding provides support at the beginning of a learning experience (like starting a new project or using a new program).
*   The passage explains that scaffolding can be virtual, giving examples like Microsoft Office's Clippy.
*   Project-based learning is a *different* pedagogical approach than scaffolding.

So, the only statement that directly contradicts the passage is that scaffolding is also known as project-based learning."

"
根據文章，以下哪一項不是赫魯雪夫對工人暴動的回應？,"The correct answer is **C: 增加減薪幅度**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the protests were *against* pay cuts. Therefore, increasing pay cuts would be the opposite of a concession.
*   The passage directly mentions that Khrushchev used tanks to restore order, appointed a new Prime Minister, and conceded to some economic demands."
以下哪一項不是波蘭騷亂的原因？,"The correct answer is **D: 任命瓦迪斯瓦夫·哥穆爾卡** (Appointment of Władysław Gomułka).

The passage states that the unrest *led to* Gomułka's appointment, not that it was a *cause* of the unrest. The other options (Communism, Food Shortages, and Wage Cuts) are all mentioned in the passage as contributing factors to the protests.
"
根據文章，以下哪一項未影響蘇聯和美國之間的關係？,"正確答案是 **B: 對德國的看法**

**解釋：**

*   文章明確指出制度、做法和文化方面的衝突導致了蘇聯和美國之間的嫌隙。
*   文章指出對德國的共同敵意促成了他們的合作，但它沒有說明他們對德國的看法在戰爭結束後如何影響他們的關係。
*   因此，選項 B 是唯一一個文章中沒有提及影響蘇聯和美國關係的因素。"
關於發送神經脈衝的目的，以下哪一項描述不正確？,"根據提供的文本：

*   神經系統藉由發送神經衝動到全身，**保持血液流動且不受干擾** (這表示管理血液流動)。
*   神經系統藉由發送神經衝動到全身，**維持體內恆定**。
*   這些神經脈衝以極快的速度傳送到身體各處，**協助身體避開潛在威脅**。

因此，A 選項 ""減緩血液流動"" 與文本內容相反，是不正確的。

所以答案是：**A: 減緩血液流動**
"
在吉薩高原上可以找到什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 大金字塔**

Although A, B, and D are mentioned, C is clearly incorrect because the passage mentions that the Great Pyramid of Giza is the *only* one of the Seven Wonders still standing. The passage specifically states the Giza Plateau, or ""Giza Pyramid Complex,"" contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx. Therefore, the presence of tombs, temples and the Great Pyramid on the Giza Plateau is discussed in the passage. Since ""all"" of the Seven Wonders are not on the Giza Plateau, and since there are multiple tombs and temples, the best answer to the question, ""What can be found on the Giza Plateau?"" is D: The Great Pyramid.

Therefore, **D: 大金字塔** is the best answer.
"
大金字塔的建造目的是什麼？,"根據文章，大金字塔是為了榮耀古夫法老所建造的。

所以答案是 **B: 榮耀一位法老**
"
我們會認識燒毀神殿的縱火犯一事是誰該負責？,"The correct answer is **C: 史特拉波**.

"
關於重建阿緹密絲神廟的說法，何者正確？,"The correct answer is **B: 神殿在亞歷山大大帝統治後重建**. Here's why:

*   The passage states the temple was rebuilt ""after Alexander died"" and ""in 323 BC"". Alexander died in 323 BC.
*   The passage mentions that Alexander offered to fund the rebuilding but was refused. (A is incorrect)
*   The passage does not say that 黑若斯達特斯 was ordered to pay (C is incorrect)
*   The passage states the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC not 320 BC. (D is incorrect)"
根據文章，用兩條腿走路的物種最早出現於何時？,"The correct answer is **A: 七百萬年前**.

The passage states that ""查德人猿可能早在七百萬年前就已用雙足行走."" This makes option A the earliest possible date for bipedalism mentioned in the text.
"
這些物種中，哪一個習慣用兩隻腳行走？,"The correct answer is **D: 南方古猿**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""在 420 至 390 萬年前的南方古猿化石中發現了雙足運動的特性"" (Bipedal locomotion was found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago).
*   The passage also mentions *Homo Erectus* (直立人) walked upright starting two million years ago, but the question asks which of the listed species was habitual.
*   It also mentions that *Sahelanthropus tchadensis* (查德沙赫人) *may* have walked bipedally as early as seven million years ago, but it is stated as a possibility.

Therefore, Southern Ape-men (南方古猿) is the most accurate answer, as the passage directly mentions they displayed features of bipedal movement in fossils."
德國海軍在二戰期間試圖達成什麼目的？,"The correct answer is **B: 阻止英國接收人員和貨物**.

The passage states: ""德國海軍則試圖阻斷運輸（主要使用 U 型潛艇）。"" This directly implies they were trying to prevent the British from receiving personnel and goods. Option B is the most accurate and directly supported by the text.
"
根據文中提供的資訊，誰在北大西洋戰役期間的海戰取得了最大的成功？,"從文章中我們可以得知，美國試圖將人員和物資運送到英國以提供協助，而德國海軍則試圖阻斷運輸。文章最後提到如果盟軍戰敗，德國可能會征服英國，暗示了盟軍最終獲勝。因此，美國成功地將人員和物資運送到了英國。

所以答案是：

"
根據文章，在哪裡不會找到一個普通的巴比倫市民？,"The correct answer is **D: 在內部聖殿獻祭 (獻祭)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the **內部聖殿 (inner sanctum)** was only accessible to priests (祭司). Therefore, a regular Babylonian citizen would not be found there.
*   The passage states the 神廟中庭 (temple courtyard) was open and that people brought offerings.
*   The passage states people would take part in 儀式與節慶 (rituals and festivals) so they would be at the temple."
以下哪些是專為祭司而設的？,"The correct answer is **B: 內部聖殿**.

Here's why:

*   **Internal Sanctuary:** The passage explicitly states that only priests were allowed to enter the internal sanctuary.
*   **Rituals:** Although priests played a central role in carrying out rituals, rituals are done for the god and the people.
*   **Festivals:** Festivals include the people as well.
*   **Ziggurats:** The passage states that the special temple with ziggurats is also a special temple for gods."

猶太家族大部分時間都在哪裡度過？,"The passage states: ""猶太家族生活中大多時刻都是在室外度過。 婦女會在院子裡煮飯;商店不過是一個對著大街的櫃檯。"" This indicates that Jewish families spent most of their time outdoors, with women cooking in the courtyard (院子裡).

Therefore, the best answer is **A: 在戶外** (In the outdoors). While they might also spend time in the courtyard (院子裡) and streets (街上), the passage explicitly states ""most of the time outdoors.""

**A: 在戶外** is the best and most encompassing answer.
"

Here's why:

*   **A: 貧窮的客人坐在椅子上用餐 (Poor guests sitting on chairs to eat)** - This aligns with the passage which states that the poor sat on chairs to eat.
*   **B: 蝸牛開胃菜 (Snail appetizer)** - The passage mentions snails as a food eaten by Romans.
*   **C: 富有的男性在晚餐期間躺下來 (Wealthy men reclining during dinner)** - The passage explicitly states that wealthy men liked to recline while eating.
*   **D: 烤火雞盤 (Roasted turkey platter)** - The passage mentions that Romans did not eat turkey."

"
下列哪個陳述正確描述了杜克耶古堡火災的結果？,"The correct answer is **C: 該景點的受歡迎程度未受影響 (The popularity of the site was not affected)**

Here's why:

*   **A: 唯一倖存的遺跡是夏仲阿旺朗傑的畫像 (The only surviving relic was a portrait of Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal)**: The passage states that ""杜克耶古堡只遺下了一部份的文物，像夏巴尊王的畫像"" (Drukgyal Dzong only left behind some cultural relics, like the portrait of Shabdrung.). This means there were likely other relics that survived, not *just* the portrait.

*   **B: 西藏蒙古軍隊勝利了 (The Tibetan-Mongol army was victorious)**: The passage clearly states that the Dzong was built to commemorate a victory *against* the Tibetan-Mongol forces.

*   **D: 它由夏仲阿旺朗傑保存 (It was preserved by Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal)**: The passage states that the fortress survived and was protected AFTER the fire. While Shabdrung built the fortress, he wasn't involved in the preservation after the fire, as he had already passed away.

*   **C: 該景點的受歡迎程度未受影響 (The popularity of the site was not affected)**: The passage states ""大火過後，堡壘倖存且受到保護，仍是不丹最令人驚嘆的景點之一 (After the fire, the fort survived and was protected, and is still one of the most amazing attractions in Bhutan)"".

所以答案是 C。"
以下哪項陳述並未正確描述獅子的行為？,"從文章中可以得知：

*   A: 獅子生活在獅群中，是群居性貓科動物，因此「牠們很會社交」是正確的。
*   B: 文章提到獅群的行為和狼群非常相像，因此「牠們的行為與狼差不多」是正確的。
*   C: 文章提到獅子對獵物非常狠，但沒有明確區分雄性和雌性，可以推斷「雄性和雌性對獵物出手都很致命」是正確的。
*   D: 文章明確指出獅子的行為不像其他大型貓科動物，因此「牠們的行為類似於其他大型貓科動物」是錯誤的。

**原因：**

*   **A:** 段落提到美洲豹貓“與周圍環境融為一體，然後再撲向獵物”，這表明它們會隱蔽身形融入周圍環境。
*   **B:** 段落提到“美洲豹貓憑靠嗅覺跟蹤和尋找獵物，用嗅聞的方式找出獵物出沒的地點”，表明它們會追踪獵物的氣味。
*   **C:** 段落提到“牠們在夜晚擁有良好的夜視能力，還可以靜悄悄地移動”，表明牠們有夜間追踪獵物。
*   **D:** 段落提到“美洲豹貓的獵物幾乎都比牠們的體型小很多”，表示幾乎都狩獵體型小的動物，但並非「只」狩獵。

因此，選項 D 並非美洲豹貓狩獵方式的「一部分」。"
以下哪項並未正確描述美洲豹貓？ ,"The correct answer is **C: 牠們的嗅覺很弱 (Their sense of smell is weak)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that scientists believe ocelots rely on their sense of smell to track and find prey. This directly contradicts option C.

因此，老虎**最不厲害**的強項是**攀爬**。

所以答案是 **B: 攀爬**
"
根據文章，老虎和獅子的區別是什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 吼叫的聲音**.

The passage explicitly states that ""老虎的吼嘯不像獅子全然是嗓音的吼嘯，而比較像是一句混亂、喊叫的話語 (Tiger's roar is not a purely vocal roar like a lion's, but more like a chaotic, shouted phrase)."" This indicates a difference in their roaring sounds.

根據文章，下列哪個例子會阻礙進化的過程？,"根據文章，種化的關鍵是小群體與主要族群隔離，並在新環境中發展出不同的適應能力。 如果小群體無法在新環境中生存，那麼就不會有後續的適應和分化，也就無法產生新物種。

因此，正確答案是 **A: 小群體無法在新環境中生存**
"
下列哪一個敘述並未正確描述物種形成的過程？ ,"正確答案是 **A: 發生於新族群無法適應環境時**

**原因：**

文章中描述的物種形成是基於新族群*成功*適應新環境。如果新族群無法適應，他們會死亡或返回原始族群（如果可能的話），而不會形成新物種。 文章提到，新環境需要新人口*改變*、適應才能有更強大的競爭力。 並且隨著時間的推移，新族群的外表和特徵會越來越不同，最終形成新物種。

其他選項都是文章中提到的：

*   **B: 這是進化過程的一個重要部分:** 文章最後一句提到 ""種化是演化過程中無法避免的後果，也是很重要的一環。""
*   **C: 它指的是新物種的形成:** 文章最後一句提到 ""這個過程稱為種化，表示新物種產生。""
*   **D: 無法避免它的發生:** 文章最後一句提到 ""種化是演化過程中無法避免的後果..."""

"
文中沒有提到以下何者為受昆蟲飛行能力影響的事物？,"Let's analyze the passage and the options:

*   **P:** The passage states that the ability to fly helps insects avoid predators and find food and mates more effectively. The passage also mentions folding wings.
*   **Q:** The question asks what is **not** mentioned as being affected by insects' flying ability.

Now let's examine the options:

*   **A: 繁殖 (Reproduction):** The passage explicitly mentions that flight helps insects find mates, which is directly related to reproduction.
*   **B: 壽命 (Lifespan):** The passage implies that avoiding predators increases survival chances, which directly impacts lifespan.
*   **C: 採食 (Foraging/Food Gathering):** The passage explicitly mentions that flight helps insects find food more effectively.
*   **D: 效率 (Efficiency):** The passage states that insects can more effectively find food, and mates, meaning efficiency of food gathering and mate finding.

The correct answer is **B: 壽命** because while avoiding predators would likely increase lifespan, the text doesn't directly mention壽命壽命.

Therefore, the answer is **B**."
以下哪一個特徵通常與恐龍無關？,"The correct answer is **B: 羽毛 (Feathers)**

Here's why:

*   **P states that birds are descendants of dinosaurs and have many similarities.** It lists similarities like scales and claws on their feet, laying eggs, and walking on two hind legs.
*   **The passage specifically mentions that many people don't consider birds dinosaurs because they have feathers.** This implies that feathers are *not* a trait typically associated with dinosaurs in the common perception.

Therefore, feathers are the trait that is usually *not* associated with dinosaurs."
下列哪一項通常不被認為是鳥類和恐龍共同特徵？,"The passage states that dinosaurs and birds share the following characteristics:

*   Scales and claws on their feet
*   Laying eggs
*   Walking on two hind legs

The passage also notes that many people don't consider birds to be dinosaurs *because* they can fly. This implies that flight is not a characteristic shared by all dinosaurs.

Therefore, the answer is **C: 飛行能力**."

由於題目要求選一個正確答案，而A和B都對，最嚴謹的回答應該是：

**A: 尖銳的葉子 (以及樹幹)**

但如果只能選一個，**A: 尖銳的葉子** 更直接地回答了題目""哪一部分""，因為""樹幹""是在扯下樹葉之後才食用的。

所以，最符合原文的答案是 **A**，但如果選項可以複選，A和B都是正確的。
"
根據文章，以下哪一項最有可能成為三角龍的食物？ ,"根據文章，最有可能成為三角龍食物的是 **B: 有堅硬樹枝的植物**。

"
以下哪個原因會讓滑冰者轉彎？,"The correct answer is **A: 溜冰鞋冰刀底部的輕微弧度**.

The passage explicitly states: ""由於冰刀底部略有弧度，當冰刀往某側傾斜時，其接觸冰面的邊緣亦呈彎曲。 這會使溜冰者轉向。"" (Because the blade has a slight curve, when the blade is tilted to one side, the edge in contact with the ice also curves. This causes the skater to turn.)

The passage states: ""在通電數百小時之後，燈泡中的鎢絲最終會燒壞，燈泡也不再發亮。 (After hundreds of hours of being powered on, the tungsten filament in the bulb eventually burns out, and the bulb no longer lights up.)"" This directly answers the question of what causes the bulb to fail.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 燈具未正確關閉 (The light fixture is not properly turned off)**: This is related to safety when changing the bulb, not the reason the bulb fails.
*   **B: 燈泡的金屬底部只有部分插進插座 (The metal base of the bulb is only partially inserted into the socket)**: This is a potential safety hazard, not the reason the bulb fails.
*   **D: 流入插座的電流變慢 (The current flowing into the socket slows down)**: The passage doesn't mention anything about the current slowing down.
"
更換燈泡時，以下哪個可能有觸電危險？,"The correct answer is **C: 燈泡的底座 (燈泡的底座)**.

根據文章，以下哪個被視為皇位繼承人典型會做的事？,"The correct answer is **D: 先上大學再從軍**

"
愛沙尼亞語受什麼影響？,"The best answer is **B: 德國字母表**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Estonian writing ""originates from the German alphabet"". While German monks were the driving force, the direct influence was the alphabet itself.

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: 字符 Õ/õ** While the character is a specific element of Estonian, the primary influence was the broader alphabet.
*   **C: 德國僧侶** While the monks initiated the writing system, they are people, not the direct influence on the language's structure.
*   **D: 上帝** God was the motivation behind the monks' actions, but not a direct influence on the linguistic structure of Estonian."

*   **A** 說韓文字母在世宗統治初期發明。 由於韓文字母是在 1444 年發明的，而世宗的統治始於 1418 年，因此這並非統治初期。
*   **B** 說這個字母表最初的名字是湖南正音。 韓文字母最初的名字是「訓民正音」，而非「湖南正音」。
*   **C** 說韓文字母是由朝鮮王朝的第四代國王發明的。 這是正確的。
*   **D** 說韓文字母是特意發明的。 這是正確的。

因此，答案為 **B**。"

"
根據文章，以下哪一項陳述正確描述了月球的外層？,"The correct answer is **C: 遠側的月海可能較少 (The far side likely has fewer maria.)**

Here's why:

*   **P states:** ""或許在近端因地殼較薄而有更多月海 (Perhaps there are more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner.)"" This implies the opposite is true for the far side, where the crust is thicker.

Let's eliminate the other options:

*   **A: 近側有更厚的地殼 (The near side has a thicker crust)** - P explicitly states the opposite.
*   **B: 高原下的地殼更薄 (The crust is thinner under highlands)** - P states ""它在月海下較薄，在高原下則較厚 (It is thinner under maria and thicker under highlands)"".
*   **D: 高原下的月海可能較少 (There might be fewer maria under the highlands)** - The passage doesn't directly mention relationship between highlands and maria count, but it rather implies the connection between the maria count and crust thickness.

"
根據文章，月球地殼最厚的地方在哪裡？,"The correct answer is **C: 在高地下**

The passage states: ""It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands."" Highlands translate to 高原, so C is the correct answer.
"
根據文章，有些人相信以下哪一項？,"The correct answer is **C: 生命存在於其他星球上 (Life exists on other planets)**.

"
何者並非亞馬遜河造就的榮譽？,"正確答案是 **C: 它是最長的河流**

根據段落內容，亞馬遜河是地球上**第二長**的河流，而不是最長的。
"
文章提到的哪個行業別雇用的委內瑞拉人最少？,"The correct answer is **C: 石油業 (Oil Industry)**.

*   The passage states that about **25%** of the population works in Industry.
*   The passage states that **two-thirds (66.67%)** of the population works in the Service Industry.

Therefore, the oil industry employs the fewest people."

The passage states that ""三分之二的委內瑞拉工作人口從事服務業"" which is a larger proportion than the other sectors listed.
"
根據文章，融合可以讓恆星做什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 散發光和熱**.

The passage states: ""星星會發出光和熱，這是因為氫原子會在融合形成質量更重的元素時產生能量.""  This directly links fusion to the emission of light and heat from stars. While fusion also forms heavier elements (A), and the goal is to build fusion reactors (B), the passage directly says fusion causes stars to emit light and heat. D is incorrect as fusion *consumes* hydrogen atoms.
"

段落中明確說明了 ""不論是氣體、液體或固體型態，都有相同的分子結構。 雖然它的物理狀態可能會改變，但它的化學狀態依舊不變。""  這表示即使水變換形態，它的分子結構（兩個氫原子和一個氧原子）仍然保持不變。

其他選項不正確的原因：

*   **B: 密度** - 段落中提到液態氮比氣態氮密度更高，所以密度會變。
*   **C: 物理狀態** - 題幹本身就在說物理狀態會改變。
*   **D: 液態氮** - 這與水改變形態無關。
"
根據文章，以下哪一項不是十三個州試圖實施某些法律時的問題？,"The correct answer is **A: 國家當局的嚴格監督**.

Here's why:

*   **P explicitly states the opposite of A.** P mentions that the central government was weak and had to rely on the states, implying a lack of strict oversight from the national authority.
*   **B: 國會內部缺乏權力** is stated in P: ""國會沒有權力徵稅..."".
*   **C: 要求一致同意的修正案** is stated in P: ""這些條例需要所有州全體一致的同意才能進行修改"".
*   **D: 一個不存在的國家行政部門** is stated in P: ""又因為沒有國家行政或司法部門"".

Therefore, A is the only option that was *not* a problem faced by the thirteen states under the Articles of Confederation according to the passage.
"
根據文章，以下哪一種陳述正確反映了中央政府在獨立戰爭期間的狀態？,"The correct answer is **C: 州代表缺席**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""...各州對中央政府的態度非常草率，他們的代表時常缺席."" This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 稅收是由國會和州當局執行的:** The passage explicitly states that Congress *didn't* have the power to tax.
*   **B: 依賴國會的權威來修正章程:** The passage says the Articles required unanimous consent from *all states* to be amended, not just Congressional authority.
*   **D: 中央政府由兩個主要組成部分構成:** The passage states Congress was its *only* institution."

"
根據文章，吉薩金字塔的哪個特質可能不會讓新王國時期的埃及人感到驚奇？,"The correct answer is **B: 使用石材 (Using stone)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""雖然石製金字塔的建造一直延續到古王國末期... (Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom...)"" This tells us that using stone for pyramid construction was *not* unique to the Giza pyramids.  New Kingdom Egyptians would have been familiar with stone construction.
* **The passage emphasizes:** ""...但吉薩金字塔的施工規模和卓越技術無人可及 (but the scale and exceptional engineering of the Giza pyramids were unmatched)."" This implies that the *size* and *construction techniques* of the Giza pyramids *would* have been astonishing to later Egyptians.
* **The passage mentions:** ""當時這些遺跡已經超過千年之久了 (at that time these ruins were already over a thousand years old)."" This implies that the *age* of the Giza pyramids would have been astonishing to later Egyptians.

Therefore, the only characteristic that *would not* have been surprising to the New Kingdom Egyptians is the use of stone itself.
"
根據文章，草食動物在追求雨水時從哪裡出發？,"The correct answer is **B: 北邊山丘**.

While options A and B (breathwork and mantra recitation) are mentioned in the context of Kundalini yoga within Tibetan Buddhism, they aren't specifically identified as the *core* of Tibetan Buddhist *meditation* in the same way that deity visualization is. Option D (mastering yoga postures) is mentioned in reference to Kundalini yoga but not specifically tied to meditation practice itself.
"
根據文章，脈輪在西藏冥想「核心」期間是如何被啟動的？,"The correct answer is **B: 透過觀想神佛 (Through visualizing deities).**

Thus, Lakhbir Singh Lakha (拉克·辛) is the one who sang a devotional song (bhajan) in connection with the offering of food (Chhappan Bhog).
"
晚上的倒數第二場表演是什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 蘇珊·雅克蘇、亞歷山大·沙費納和哈麗絲·亞力克西烏**

"
亞歷山大·沙費納是什麼國籍？,"The passage states that Alessandro Safina is an Italian tenor. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: 義大利**
"
根據文章，以下哪個敘述不正確？,"根據文章，選項 A 是不正確的。文章提到消防隊長，但沒有提到聖塔克拉拉發生火災。其他選項都直接或間接來自文章：

*   C: 有提供水給乘客喝 (文章明確提到)
*   D: 至少要 60 分鐘，才能讓第一個人下車 (文章明確提到「至少要花一個小時才能把第一個人從雲霄飛車上救下來」)

"

"
警方何時能使用雷達槍測量強尼瑞德的駕駛速度？,"The correct answer is **A: He was driving at 160 km/h**.

The passage states: ""紐西蘭警方未能使用測速槍測得瑞德的車速，直到車速降至時速 160 公里，警察才成功測得一次."" This directly translates to ""New Zealand police were unable to use speed guns to measure Reid's speed until the speed dropped to 160 km/h, only then were the police successful once.""
"
根據文章，為什麼紐西蘭警方很難測量強尼瑞德的速度？,"The correct answer is **B: 車子的高度非常低**.

The passage states: ""因為黑美人車身太低，紐西蘭警方未能使用測速槍測得瑞德的車速..."" which directly indicates the car's low height was the reason.

The prompt states ""伊拉克的阿布格萊布監獄在一次暴亂中慘遭祝融"" which translates to ""Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison was destroyed by fire during a riot."" The question ""在阿布格萊布監獄的暴亂期間發生了什麼？"" means ""What happened during the riot at Abu Ghraib prison?"".  The fire is the direct result of the riot.

While A, B, and C are related to Abu Ghraib prison, they are not what *happened during the riot* itself.
"
伊拉克監獄為何聲名狼藉？ ,"The best answer is **D: 揭發了虐待囚犯的行為 (揭發了虐待囚犯的行為)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the prison became notorious because of the abuse scandal after the U.S. took over.
*   While the fire (A) and the U.S. takeover (B) are facts from the passage, they aren't the reason for the notoriety.
*   While the prison did suffer a riot (C), that doesn't explain the negative fame of the prison.

Therefore, the abuse scandal is the correct answer."
在茂宜島的戰爭紀念館體育場將舉行哪種活動？,"The correct answer is **C: 音樂會 (音樂會)**.

The passage states ""樂團取消了在茂宜島戰爭紀念體育場的演出，該演出原定會有 9,000 人參加，並向歌迷道歉."" The word ""演出"" (yǎnchū) translates to ""performance"" or ""show,"" and in this context, it refers to a concert by the band.
"
誰最終對活動取消做出了解釋？,"The correct answer is **B: Management company**.

The passage states that ""The band's management company HK Management Inc. ... but the next day blamed logistical issues.""
"

The passage states: ""西米諾夫表示當他 2013 年在《創業鯊魚幫》節目上露面後，銷售額提高了..."" which directly indicates sales growth after appearing on Shark Tank.
"
傑米·西米諾夫何時決定創辦鈴響公司的？,"The correct answer is **A: 在意識到自己的門鈴不適用後**.

The passage states that Jamie Siminoff created Ring because he couldn't hear his doorbell in his garage workshop. This is the initial impetus for starting the company. The other options are things that happened *after* the company was founded.

"
是什麼導致《彩虹閱讀》系列節目的停播？,"The best answer is **A: 資金不足**.

The passage states: ""包括約翰葛蘭特在內的一些人認為，財政困難及電視教育節目理念的改變，促使此系列畫下句點。"" This directly mentions financial difficulties (資金不足) as a contributing factor to the show's cancellation.

Let's look at why the other options are not as good:

*   **B: 缺乏艾美獎:** The passage states the show won over 24 Emmy Awards, so this is incorrect.
*   **C: 約翰·格蘭特的意見:** While John Grant's opinion is mentioned, it's presented as *one* of the reasons, alongside financial difficulties and changing ideas about educational TV. Financial difficulties are a more direct and prominent cause.
*   **D: 《羅傑斯先生的鄰居》節目的成功:** The passage mentions 《羅傑斯先生的鄰居》僅僅是為了提供情境資料，沒有跡象表明該節目的成功導致了《彩虹閱讀》的取消。
"
以下哪一項不是阿姆斯特丹和博物館官員對樹的爭辯之一？,"The correct answer is **B: 應該保存下來**.

The passage states that the Amsterdam government and Anne Frank House personnel argued that the tree was infected with fungus, likely to fall, and a danger to public health. This means they were arguing *against* preserving the tree. Option B is the only one that contradicts their position.
"

"

"
為什麼澳洲還沒有核能產業？,"The correct answer is **D: 太昂貴 (Too expensive)**.

The passage states that Costello supports nuclear energy ""once it is economically feasible"" and ""once it can be commercialized."" This directly implies that the reason Australia doesn't have a nuclear industry yet is because it's currently not economically viable.
"

The passage states: ""波蘭男子視障滑雪選手麥傑·克雷澤和領滑員安娜·奧加辛斯卡在超級大迴轉中獲得第 13 名。"" This clearly indicates that 麥傑·克雷澤 is a visually impaired skier who competed with a guide.

根據文章，關於布雷克的哪個說法不正確？,"正確答案是 **B: 他承認攻擊**

文章明確指出，主播否認自己的攻擊行為。 其他選項都與文章內容相符：

*   **A: 他當場被捕** - 文章提到「當場被捕的主播」
*   **C: 他在攻擊中使用了一根棍子** - 文章提到他聲稱「棍子是用來保護自己」
*   **D: 他聲稱有人向他扔瓶子** - 文章提到他聲稱「有多達 30 個人朝他扔瓶子」"
根據文章，以下哪件事沒有發生在布雷克身上？,"正確答案是 **C: 他被人用棍子攻擊**。

文章說的是主播聲稱他使用棍子自衛，並未提到布雷克被棍子攻擊。
"
聯合國的全球暖化經費不會用於什麼？,"選項D，「緩解全球暖化的影響」是錯誤的。 根據P段落，聯合國希望敲定經費，**幫助受全球暖化影響的國家解決衍生問題**，這正是緩解全球暖化的影響的一種方式。

選項A、B和C都是段落中明確提及的經費可能用途。

因此，正確答案是 **B: 將技術帶到發展中國家**。 因為題目問的是**不會**用於什麼，而經費是用於幫助開發中國家以較不汙染環境的方式發展，這意味著經費會用於將技術帶到發展中國家。
"
根據文章，聯合國希望拯救什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 剩餘的雨林**.

The passage specifically mentions ""拯救世界上剩餘的森林"" (saving the world's remaining forests) as one of the topics in the Bali agenda. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.
"
以下哪項不是阿爾伯特·穆昌加認為仍需商定的事項？,"The correct answer is **B: 開始交易的日期**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""但我們所建立的架構已足以讓我們在 2020 年 7 月 1 日開始進行交易"" (But the framework we have established is sufficient for us to start trading on July 1, 2020). This implies that the start date for trading is already agreed upon.

The passage also indicates that origin rules and tariff concessions have not yet been agreed.
"
根據文章，為什麼交易可以在七月開始？,"The correct answer is **B: 已經有足夠的規則和讓步架構.**

The text states: ""...we have not yet achieved agreement on rules of origin and tariff concessions, *but the framework we have put in place is sufficient to allow us to start trading on 1 July 2020*.""

This directly supports option B.  The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A:** The text doesn't say that this is a condition.
*   **C:** While the director's statement is relevant, it's the *framework* that allows trade, not just the approval.
*   **D:** The text explicitly says they *haven't* agreed on these.
"
根據文章，亞特蘭大憲法報指責教育官員做什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 沒有針對檢測到的內部問題採取行動**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""...the Atlanta Constitution published a report stating there were problems with test results... and pointed out that the schools had conducted an internal investigation but did not act on the results.""

Let's eliminate the other options:

*   **A: 篡改亞特蘭大憲法報的報告:** The article states the exam papers were tampered with, not the newspaper's report.
*   **B: 未能創新城市教育:** The passage states she was recognized for innovating city education, so this is incorrect.
*   **D: 報告的測試分數很低:** The article states the opposite: the test scores improved rapidly, which was what raised suspicion.
"
根據文中提供的資訊，亞特蘭大憲法報的報告中沒有提到什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 試卷被篡改的證據**

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""...此後，有證據顯示試卷經過竄改..."" This means the report *preceded* the discovery of evidence of cheating.
*   **The passage says the report DID mention:**
    *   **A: 測試分數提升的不尋常:** ""...測驗分數進步速度之快令人難以置信...""
    *   **C: 2009 年年度國家教育局長得主:** The passage focuses on Hall and her award.
    *   **D: 創新城市教育的建議:** ""...因創新的城市教育受到肯定..."" It can be assumed the report highlights Hall's education.

Therefore, the report could not have mentioned the evidence of test tampering because that evidence came to light *after* the report was published."
根據文章，哪些資訊在爆炸後得知？,"The best answer is **C: 是否有額外的炸彈被引爆** and **D: 官方死亡人數**

Here's why:

*   **C: 是否有額外的炸彈被引爆:** The passage states, ""Two hours later, three more bombs exploded near government buildings."" This clearly indicates that information about additional bombs being detonated was learned *after* the initial explosion.
*   **D: 官方死亡人數:** The passage mentions ""reported official death toll"" and ""official reports confirmed"" indicating that information on the official death toll was learned after the initial explosion.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **A: 最終傷害統計:** The passage says ""the true number remains unknown,"" meaning the final figures were NOT known at the time of the passage.
*   **B: 炸彈爆炸附近的建築物:** While you could infer nearby buildings, the passage's main focus is on the explosions themselves and the immediate aftermath in terms of casualties, not a detailed listing of surrounding buildings. Also, the question asks what information was known AFTER the explosion. The fact that buildings were near the explosion would have been known both before and after the explosion."
自 2017 年加入曼徹斯特城足球俱樂部以來，熱蘇斯參加了幾場比賽？,"The correct answer is **D: 53 場**.

The passage states that ""這位巴西選手共為該球隊踢了 53 場球賽"".
"
熱蘇斯因加入哪個俱樂部收取 £2700 萬英鎊的報酬？,"The correct answer is **A: 帕梅拉斯**.

The passage states that Jesus joined Manchester City *from* Palmeiras for a reported £27 million. This implies Palmeiras *received* the fee.
"
關於旅館房客的哪個說法是不正確的？,"The correct answer is **D: 大多數房客來自聖城 (Most of the lodgers were from the holy city).**

Here's why:

*   **A: 房客來麥加朝聖 (Lodgers came to Mecca on pilgrimage):** The passage states the lodgers were visiting the holy city of Mecca ""on the eve of the Hajj pilgrimage"". This implies they are pilgrims.
*   **B: 有些房客不是當地公民 (Some of the lodgers are not local citizens):** The passage mentions that the lodgers were mainly people from the United Arab Emirates. This indicates that they were not citizens of Mecca/Saudi Arabia (the location of Mecca).
*   **C: 房客們在朝覲前夕到達那裡 (Lodgers arrived there on the eve of the Hajj):** This is directly stated in the passage.
*   **D: 大多數房客來自聖城 (Most of the lodgers were from the holy city):** The passage says the lodgers were mainly from the United Arab Emirates, not Mecca. This statement is therefore incorrect."
根據文章，以下哪個陳述是正確的？,"The correct answer is **C: 房客們在朝覲前夕到達那裡 (The guests arrived there on the eve of the Hajj)**.

Here's why:

*   **P: 當地時間今天早上 10 點，伊斯蘭聖城麥加有一處旅館倒塌。 這座建築物留宿了一些在麥加朝覲前夕造訪聖城的朝聖者們。 (P: At 10 AM local time this morning, a hostel collapsed in the Islamic holy city of Mecca. The building was hosting pilgrims visiting the holy city on the eve of the Hajj.)** This statement directly confirms that the guests were there on the eve of the Hajj.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 無人死亡 (No one died)** - The passage states ""至少 15 人死亡 (at least 15 people have died)"".
*   **B: 所有房客皆來自阿拉伯聯合大公國 (All guests were from the United Arab Emirates)** - The passage states ""該青年旅館的房客主要為阿拉伯聯合大公國人民 (the hostel's guests were mainly people from the United Arab Emirates)"", indicating that while the majority were from the UAE, it doesn't necessarily mean *all* of them were.
*   **D: 阿拉伯聯合大公國人民 (People from the United Arab Emirates)** - This is partially correct, as the passage states that the guests were *mainly* from the UAE. However, option C is a more precise and accurate statement from the information given."
根據文章，有關碰撞，哪些並非不確定的資訊？,"The correct answer is **B: 碰撞的地點**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 碰撞的大小** - The passage explicitly states scientists are still trying to determine the ""magnitude"" of the impact.
*   **C: 碰撞對地球的影響** - The passage says scientists are ""still trying to determine"" the impact on Earth.
*   **D: 殘骸位置** - The passage mentions that the US Strategic Command is tracking the debris, implying the precise location is an ongoing process of tracking and analysis.

*   **B: 碰撞的地點** - While not explicitly stated, the passage does give information regarding the location: ""491 miles above Earth."" While the exact coordinates may be unknown to the reader, we do know it happened 491 miles above the Earth.

Therefore, the location of the collision (approximately 491 miles above Earth) is the only one that is known information rather than still being determined."
根據文章，以下關於碰撞的哪些事情有待商榷？,"The correct answer is **D: 碰撞的確切規模**.

The passage states: ""They are still trying to determine the magnitude of the impact and the effect on Earth."" This directly indicates that the exact magnitude (size) of the collision is still being determined. The other options are either stated facts or processes already underway.
"
根據文章，巴汀曾在美國人富豪名單上排名第幾？,"The correct answer is **C: 第 190 名**

The text states that Barton ranked 190th on the 2008 list of wealthiest Americans.
"
巴汀曾向以下哪個機構捐款？,"The correct answer is **B: 維吉尼亞大學**.

The passage explicitly states that he ""大力資助該學院"" (strongly funded that college), and earlier it mentions he graduated from the ""維吉尼亞大學藝術與科學學院"" (University of Virginia's College of Arts and Sciences).  While D is partially correct, B is the most accurate and direct answer based on the given information.
"
阿諾·史瓦辛格州長簽署的法案中不包含哪一部份？,"正確答案是 **C: 禁止在加州以外的地方向未成年人出售或租借暴力電動遊戲**

原因：

*   題目中的法案只針對加州。選項 C 明確說明了法案禁止在加州 *以外* 的地方販售或租借，這與原文資訊不符。其他選項都正確反映了史瓦辛格州長簽署法案的內容。"
根據文章，誰錯過了別人正在說的事情？,"The correct answer is **C: 米勒**

The passage states that Miller ""didn't hear what he (McKeen) said"" because he was busy preparing.
"
根據文章，以下哪項米勒在聽證會上的經歷是正確的？,"正確答案是 **B: 他正在準備所以沒有注意**

P 聲明米勒「其實沒聽到他說了什麼」，因為他正在做準備。 因此，B 是唯一與文章資訊一致的選項。
"
是誰建議對《空氣潔淨法》進行修訂？,"The correct answer is **C: 傑克·林頓 (Jack Layton)**.

The passage states: ""雷頓在與總理的會面中，請求修改保守黨的環境法案，要求「全面徹底改寫」保守黨所提的環境法案."" This clearly indicates that Jack Layton requested changes to the air cleanliness act.
"
是誰駁斥《空氣潔淨法》被當作選舉前的噱頭？,"The passage says Prime Minister John Howard argued that his intervention with Mersey Hospital wasn't a pre-election stunt, but was to protect the hospital. However, the question is asking about who rejected the Clean Air Act as a pre-election stunt. Therefore, none of the options answer the question.
"
當三聚氰酸和三聚氰胺在貓尿中相互反應時，會形成什麼化合物？,"The correct answer is **C: 結晶**.

The passage states: ""貴湖大學的研究員表示，兩種化合物會互相反應，產生阻礙腎功能的結晶。 研究人員在貓尿中加入三聚氰胺和三聚氰酸，並觀察其中形成的結晶。"" This clearly indicates that the reaction between the two compounds results in the formation of crystals.
"
研究人員使用紅外光譜觀察了什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 寵物尿液中的結晶成份**.

The passage states that the researchers used FTIR to compare the crystals formed in the cat urine with the crystals found in the affected pets' urine. FTIR is used to identify the composition of a substance.
"
誰稱露娜為「極限女王」？,"The correct answer is **D: 湯米·卓門 (Tommy Dreamer)**.

"
誰指稱露娜很「怪異」？,"The correct answer is **B: 達斯汀·讓尼爾斯**.

The passage states: ""知名摔角手「金粉」達斯汀·讓尼爾斯 (Dustin Runnels) 評論說：「盧納和我一樣怪異…或許甚至比我還要怪異…我愛她，並且會想念她……希望她去了一個更好的地方。」""
"
撞車事故中的司機沒有發生什麼事？,"The correct answer is **A: 他頭部受傷 (He suffered a head injury)**.

The passage explicitly states that the driver suffered a serious head injury. Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 他沒有傷害到房屋內的任何人 (He did not harm anyone inside the house)** While true, the question is about what happened to the driver, not the people in the house.

*   **C: 他從劍橋的醫院轉到了大雅茅斯的一家醫院 (He was transferred from a hospital in Cambridge to a hospital in Great Yarmouth)** The passage says he was transferred *from* Great Yarmouth *to* Cambridge, so this is backwards.

*   **D: 急診處從車裡把他救出來 (The emergency room rescued him from the car)** The passage states that ""緊急救難人員 (Emergency rescue personnel)"" rescued the driver from the car, not the emergency room.

Therefore, only A correctly describes something that happened to the driver."
在橄欖球賽期間，何者並非南非隊比賽突出的地方？,"The correct answer is **C: 在比賽開始時表現出色**.

The passage states: ""賽事頭號種子南非隊開賽非常順利，以 26 比 0 輕鬆取勝第五種子尚比亞隊."" This means they *did* start the game very well. The question asks what *wasn't* a standout feature. A, B, and D were all explicitly mentioned as strengths, but C directly contradicts the passage.
"
根據文章，南非隊的比賽是什麼時候開始進步的？,"The correct answer is **D: 隨著比賽的進行** (As the game progressed).

The passage states: ""雖然在比賽中與南方姊妹們相比確實生疏了些，但隨著比賽的進行，南非隊很穩定地在進步。"" (Although they were indeed a bit rusty compared to their Southern sisters in the game, South Africa steadily improved as the game went on.)
"
根據文章，哪一個陳述並未正確反映中國的經濟狀況？,"正確答案是 **B: 中國擁有比美國更大的汽車出口市場**

理由：

* **P: 根據文章**，中國的經濟狀況敘述為:
    * A: 自從改革以來，中國的經濟呈指數級增長 (正確，經濟規模成長 90 倍，可解釋為指數型增長)
    * C: 中國最終可能會擁有比美國更高的 GDP (正確，文章說 20 年內可能超越美國)
    * D: 中國出口的汽車從未比德國多 (正確，文章說*去年*才第一次超越德國)

* **B: 中國擁有比美國更大的汽車出口市場** (錯誤，文章說中國汽車出口量 *首次超越德國*，並成為該產業*最大的市場*，但並沒有說它超越了美國的汽車*出口*市場。成為最大的市場可能是指國內銷售市場，而非出口量。)

因此，B 項的敘述並未正確反映文章中描述的中國經濟狀況。
"
根據文章，中國的國民生產毛額 (GDP) 何時可能會超過美國？,"The correct answer is **B: 在二十年內**.

The passage states: ""中國的 GDP 在 20 年之內就可能超過美國"" which directly translates to ""China's GDP might surpass the US in 20 years"".
"
胡錦濤建議發展中國家做什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 避免污染的老路**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""胡錦濤鼓勵發展中的國家「避免先汙染、後清理的老路」."" This translates to ""Hu Jintao encouraged developing countries to 'avoid the old path of polluting first and cleaning up later.'""
*   The other options are incorrect or misinterpret the text:
    *   A: He encourages them to NOT take obligations B: is a focus for china according to his words but not the focus of developing nations
    *   C: He says they should NOT take obligation that they cannot meet
"
胡錦濤沒提到什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 碳減排量的數字**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""He did not set a reduction *number*...""

The other options are incorrect because:

*   A: 削減的基礎 (The basis of reduction) - He said he will reduce based on China's economic output.
*   B: 對發展中國家在污染方面的建議 (Recommendations for developing countries on pollution) - He encouraged developing countries to ""avoid the old path of polluting first and cleaning up later.""
*   C: 希望減少碳排放的日期 (The date he hopes to reduce carbon emissions) - He stated ""by 2020."""
費爾曼說以下何者的情況不好？,"The correct answer is **B: 安哥拉**.

The passage states that ""安哥拉正面臨它們有史以來最嚴重的疫情，且安哥拉的情況仍然非常糟。"" which translates to ""Angola is facing its worst epidemic ever, and the situation in Angola remains very bad."" This clearly indicates that according to Fairman, the situation in Angola is not good.
"
由於起訴，誰將接任休恩的內閣職位？,"The correct answer is **A:戴維**.

The passage states: ""休恩已辭職，他在內閣的職位將由愛德·戴維議員接任."" (Hugh has resigned, and his cabinet position will be filled by MP Ed Davey.)
"
在起訴後，誰將出任商務大臣？,"The correct answer is **A: 蘭姆**

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""諾曼·蘭姆議員有望接替戴維，出任商務大臣一職 (Norman Lamb is expected to succeed Davey as Business Secretary).""
*   The passage states ""休恩已辭職 (Huhne has resigned)"" therefore he can not be the Business Secretary.
*   The passage states ""休恩已辭職，他在內閣的職位將由愛德·戴維議員接任 (Huhne has resigned, and his cabinet position will be taken over by Ed Davey MP)."" so Davey is taking over Huhne's previous role and therefore will not be the Business Secretary.
*   The passage states ""檢察長基爾‧斯塔摩今早發表聲明，宣布起訴休恩和普萊斯 (Attorney General Kier Starmer issued a statement this morning announcing the indictment of Huhne and Price.)"" therefore Starmer is the Attorney General and not the Business Secretary."
表演者在卡米爾·聖桑的歌劇中鼓勵觀眾做什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 參與使用大麻 (參與使用大麻)**.

The passage states the performers are smoking marijuana cigarettes on stage, and the theater encourages the audience to do the same.
"
誰主要在歌劇中抽大麻捲菸？,"The correct answer is **C: 表演者 (Performers)**.

The passage states ""表**演者**在舞台上抽大麻捲菸 (Performers smoke marijuana cigarettes on stage)"".
"
雷歐諾夫執行的「太空漫步」的另一個名稱是什麼？,"正確答案是 **C: 艙外活動**

原文中明確指出「太空載具外活動 (EVA) ，或稱「太空漫步」」，所以選項 C 艙外活動 (EVA) 是太空漫步的另一個名稱。
"

The passage states that he led the Soviet part of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.
"
誰在車禍中受傷？,"正確答案是 **A: 吉布森**。

根據文章，吉布森被送往醫院，但不久後身亡。卡車司機沒有受傷，車庫工人和孩子們目擊了車禍但沒有受傷。
"
捲入事故中的人們發生了什麼事？,"The correct answer is **B: 一個沒受傷，一個死了**

Here's why:

*   **吉布森死了:** The passage clearly states that Gibson was taken to the hospital but died shortly after.
*   **卡車司機沒受傷:** The passage states that the 64-year-old truck driver was uninjured in the accident.
*   **選項 A 不正確**，因為「他們」指的是司機和吉布森，司機並未死亡。
*   **選項 C 不正確**，因為尖叫和哭泣的是孩子，而不是車禍中受傷的人。
*   **選項 D 不正確**，因為只有吉布森受了傷。"
為該計劃工作的科學家希望觀察以下何者造成的影響？,"The correct answer is **B: 潮汐引力 (Tidal forces)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""The team wants to observe the effect that tidal stripping has on the Sagittarius galaxy as it interacts with the Milky Way, as dark matter affects each.""
*   It further explains: ""Just as the moon's gravity causes tides on Earth, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy."" This is a direct analogy to tidal forces.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 固定事件 (Fixed event):** This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: 小粒子 (Small particles):** While the passage mentions that the dark matter halo is made of many small particles, the scientists are not directly trying to observe the particles themselves. They are observing the *effect* of dark matter, which manifests as tidal forces.
*   **D: 暗物質 (Dark matter):** While dark matter is crucial to the process being studied, the team is observing the effects it has, which is the tidal force."
科學家正在觀察下列哪些事物？,"The correct answer is **D: 人馬座星系和銀河**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the research aims to simulate observations of the **人馬座星系 (Sagittarius dwarf galaxy)**.
* It also explicitly mentions the interaction between **銀河 (Milky Way)** and Sagittarius due to tidal forces.
* The analogy to the moon and Earth is to *explain* the tidal forces, not what they are observing.
"
根據文章，保守派不會批評以下何者？,"正確答案是 **B: 缺乏重建努力**。

理由如下：

*   **原文資訊：**
    *   財政保守派人士將卡崔娜颶風後的救濟與重建支出稱為「布希的紐奧良交易」，暗示他們對此不滿。
    *   自由派的批評重點在於重建合約被華府圈內人壟斷。

*   **推論：**
    *   由於保守派將其稱為「交易」，且原文討論了救濟與重建*支出*，可以推斷他們對救濟支出（A）和重建支出（D）持有批評態度。
    *   自由派批評的是「誰獲得重建合約」（C）。
    *   如果缺乏重建努力，就不會有支出，更不會有「交易」可言。因此，保守派不會批評「缺乏重建努力」。

因此，正確答案是 B。
"
誰在批評卡崔娜颶風救援工作的重建合約？,"正確答案是 **B: 自由派**

解釋：

題目文字提到：「自由派對推動重建的批評，主要在於重建合約犒賞了一般認為的華府圈內人。」 這直接說明自由派批評卡崔娜颶風救援工作的重建合約。
"
根據文章，星塵號太空船發出的光首先會在哪裡看到？,"The passage states: ""It will cross the West Coast of Northern California, illuminating the skies from California through central Oregon and across Nevada and Idaho to Utah.""

Therefore, the light from the Stardust spacecraft will first be seen in **B: Northern California**.
"
根據文章，該太空船將創下以下哪一項紀錄？,"The correct answer is **C: 最快返回地球**.

The passage states: ""星塵號將是最快返回地球的太空船並因而創下新的歷史紀錄..."" This directly supports option C.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: 照亮最寬闊的天空:** While the passage describes the path the spacecraft will take and the areas that will see the light show, it doesn't claim it will light up the widest area ever.
*   **B: 最多城市可看到它:** The passage mentions specific states but doesn't specify how many cities within those states will see the spacecraft, nor does it claim it will be the most cities ever.
*   **D: 最快從舊金山抵達洛杉磯:** While the passage uses the speed of the spacecraft to illustrate how fast it's moving, it doesn't state it will actually travel from San Francisco to Los Angeles, nor does it claim to set a speed record for that specific route."
馬拉·巴拉蘇布拉曼尼安醫生是薩羅雅·巴拉蘇布拉馬尼安的誰？,"The correct answer is **B: 女兒**.

The passage states: ""一名在賓州匹玆堡兒童醫院工作的醫師，在被發現她母親死於她後車箱中後，將被控加重謀殺罪."" This clearly indicates that Malar Balasubramanian is the daughter of Saroja Balasubramanian.
"
薩羅雅·巴拉蘇布拉馬尼安的屍體在哪裡被發現？,"The correct answer is **C: 汽車後車箱**.
"
eBay 收購了什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

The passage explicitly states ""eBay acquired Skype"" and mentions Skype's presence in regions eBay wanted to expand into.
"
eBay 希望透過此次收購實現什麼目標？,"Based on the provided text, the best answer is **B: 擴展到新的領域** and **C: 提高知名度**. The text explicitly states that eBay wanted to diversify its profit sources (which implies expanding into new areas) and increase its visibility in regions where Skype was already strong.

While the deal might ultimately lead to consolidating revenue (A) and satisfying shareholders (D), these are not the primary, explicitly stated goals of the acquisition according to the text. Therefore B and C are the most direct and accurate answer.
"
根據文章，誰沒有與留在現場的囚犯互動？,"The correct answer is **D: 醫院工作人員**.

Here's why:

*   **談判者 (Negotiators):** The passage explicitly states that ""談判者嘗試矯正當時的狀況 (Negotiators tried to rectify the situation)."" This means they interacted with the remaining prisoners.
*   **消防救援人員 (Firefighters):** The passage says ""消防隊最後在晚間 11:35 撲滅火勢 (Firefighters finally extinguished the fire at 11:35 PM)"". Thus they interacted with the scene.
*   **警察 (Police):** The passage mentions ""全副武裝的鎮暴警察很快就進入院子，並利用催淚瓦斯把犯人逼到死角 (Fully armed riot police quickly entered the yard and used tear gas to corner the prisoners.)"" They definitely interacted with the prisoners.
*   **醫院工作人員 (Hospital Staff):** The passage only mentions that injured individuals were taken to the hospital, but there's no indication that hospital staff had any interaction with the prisoners who remained at the scene.

Therefore, hospital staff is the only group that did *not* interact with the prisoners who remained in the yard."
以下哪一項最終讓囚犯們停止暴動？,"The correct answer is **B: 催淚瓦斯**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that riot police used tear gas to corner the inmates. This directly led to the prisoners being contained and the riot ending.
*   The other options are incorrect because the violence stopped after the injured person was taken to the hospital and did not end because of negotiation. The fire was put out at 11:35 pm which was after the prisoners were contained."
在阿亞圖拉賽義德阿里·哈米尼的觀點中，伊朗應該從什麼之中解放？,"The correct answer is **D: 對石油的依賴**.

The passage specifically states that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei described the reliance on oil as a ""trap"" that Iran should free itself from.
"
根據文章，誰承認了制裁對伊朗經濟的影響？,"正確答案是 **A: 高層消息來源**

文章明確指出 ""伊朗高層消息來源首次承認制裁有產生影響。"" 其他選項雖然都與文章內容相關，但並沒有直接承認制裁的影響。
"
以下哪項不是法國投票程序的一部分？,"The correct answer is **D: 由候選人代表進行計票 (由候選人代表進行計票)**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 透明投票箱 (透明投票箱)**: The passage explicitly states ""自 1988 年起，投票箱必須是透明的"".
*   **B: 由候選人派出的代表 (由候選人派出的代表)**: The passage mentions ""候選人能派遣代表見證流程的每一部分.""
*   **C: 簽署投票單 (簽署投票單)**: The passage says ""選民再將信封放入投票箱，並在投票單上簽名.""
*   **D: 由候選人代表進行計票 (由候選人代表進行計票)**: The passage says ""志工在嚴格監督之下遵循特定程序計票."" It does not mention that the representatives of the candidates are in charge of the counting of the votes, but volunteers.

Therefore, option D is the only one that is not specifically mentioned as part of the French voting procedure."
選民在哪裡指明他們選擇的候選人？,"The passage states: ""voting involves voters going alone into a booth and placing a pre-printed ballot stating their choice into an envelope.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: 在事先印妥的紙上**.
"
是什麼促使艾倫開始為期八年的武藏號搜尋？,"The correct answer is **D: 他對戰爭的興趣**.

The passage states: ""出於對戰爭的畢生興趣，開始尋找武藏號"" which translates to ""Driven by a lifelong interest in war, he began searching for the Musashi.""
"
根據文章，艾倫將他的大部分財產用於何者？,"正確答案是 **B: 海洋探險**

文章明確指出 ""艾倫已將大部分財產投入於海洋探勘中""。雖然尋找武藏號是海洋探勘的一部分，但海洋探勘是一個更廣泛的範疇，包含了尋找武藏號以及其他未提及的探勘活動。
"
根據文章，以下何者可能導致工廠內部和周圍出現危險情況？,"The best answer is **A: 鈾燃料**. Here's why:

*   **鈾燃料:** The passage states that the authorities suspect a container with uranium fuel has cracked and is leaking. This directly links uranium fuel to the dangerous situation.
*   **放射性銫 & 碘:** These are concerning and indicate a problem, but they are *byproducts* of the uranium fuel undergoing nuclear fission. The uranium fuel itself is the *source* of the radiation and contamination.
*   **白色煙霧:** While concerning, the white smoke itself isn't inherently dangerous in this context. It's more likely a visual indicator of a larger issue (like steam or a reaction involving the leaking materials).

Therefore, the leaking uranium fuel is the most direct and likely cause of the dangerous situation."
