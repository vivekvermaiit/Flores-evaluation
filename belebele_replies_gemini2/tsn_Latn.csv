"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se o ka reng ga se kakantsho e ntle ka go tshameka korosetina?","The correct answer is **A: Go oketsa modumo, tobetsa dikonopo ka maatla**.

The passage explicitly states that you **don't** need to press the buttons with great force to increase the volume on a concertina, unlike a piano. It says to use pressure or speed on the bellows. Therefore, pressing the buttons hard is not a good suggestion.
"
"Fa o tshameka korosetina, ke eng mo go tse di latelang, e e tla thusang go oketsa modumo?","The passage states: ""Mo korosetineng, go bona modumo o mogolwane, o dirisa kgatelelo kgotsa lebelo le legolwane mo meubeng.""  This translates to: ""In the accordion, to get a louder sound, you use more pressure or more speed on the bellows.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Go oketsa lebelo** (Increasing speed).
"
Ke ka ntlha ya eng ditshwantsho tse di mo thelebisheneng di segilwe melelwane?,"The correct answer is **B: Gore setshwantsho se khurumetse sekirini sotlhe.**

The passage explicitly states that ""Sengwe le sengwe se o se bonang mo thelebisheneng se ile sa segwa melelwane, kwa godimo, kwa tlase le kwa thoko. Se se diretswe go netefatsa go re setshwantsho se khurumetse sekirini sotlhe.""
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mathata afe a a latelang, a motho a ka kopanang le one fa a fetolela filimi kwa sebopegong sa DVD?","The correct answer is **B: Mafoko a a tlhalosang a ntshitswe go se kae.**

The passage specifically mentions that when converting a film to DVD, the overscan effect might crop the edges of the image, potentially making subtitles (which are often located at the bottom) unreadable.
"
Masole a Borithane a ne a le mo lefelong lefe?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: Trenton** and **C: Bordentown**. Here's why:

*   The text says General John Cadwalder would launch a diversionary attack against British defenders at **Bordentown**.
*   The main force would cross the river nine miles north of **Trenton** to launch a surprise attack.
* General James Ewing was to cross the river at Trenton Ferry."
Ke mosaeno wa ga mang o o tlhagelelang mo tlhomong ya mokwalo?,"The correct answer is **D: Charles Thomson**.

The passage states: ""mokwalo wa seatla o e seng wa bofelo o o neng o saenilwe ke moporesidente wa Congress John Hancock le mokwaledi Charles Thomson..."" This indicates that Charles Thomson's signature was on the manuscript.
"
"Mo mafelong a a latelang, matlhakore a mabedi a Dunlap a gorogile kwa kae la bofelo?","The correct answer is **C: London**.

The passage states: ""Kopololo ya sone e ile ya goroga kwa London ka di-10 tsa Phatwe."" (A copy of it arrived in London on August 10th.)

While the other locations are mentioned in the passage, London is the final location named where a copy of the Dunlap Broadsides arrived.
"
Masole a ga Colonel Stark a ne a le kwa kae?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka fa bokone, go bapisa legora**.

The passage states: ""Banna ba ga Stark ba ne ba tsaya maemo a bone go bapisa legora, ka fa bokone jwa maeno a bakolone."" This clearly indicates their position.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, banna ba ga Stark ba ne ba oketsa lorako leng?","The correct answer is **C: Fa metsi a felelang teng.**

The paragraph states: ""Fa makhubu a a kwa tlase a bula kgoro fa Nokeng ya Mystic ntlheng ya bokone-botlhaba jwa setlhaketlhake, ba ne ba oketsa lorako ka bonako ka lobota lo lo khutshwane lwa mantswe ntlheng ya bokone fa metsi a felelang teng fa letshitshing lo lo nnye."" This directly indicates that Stark's men reinforced the wall where the water met the small beach.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang, e e neng e le ka nako ya fa China e ne e tletse tshololo ya madi?","The correct answer is **D: Motlha wa Magosi a Mararo**.

The paragraph explicitly states: ""Magosi a le Mararo e ne e le nngwe ya dipaka tse di tletseng tshololo ya madi thata mo hisitoring ya China wa Bogologolo...""
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se e leng boammaruri ka setlhopa sa masole a ditshoswane a neng a aga manno a nakwana, a a agiwang sesha letsatsi le letsatsi?","The correct answer is **B: Fa a felelwa ke dijo.**

The paragraph states ""Masole a simolola go bothologa fa a felelwa ke dijo. Ka nako eo, masole a aga manno a nakwana, a a agiwang sesha tsatsi le letsatsi."" This directly links the building of temporary shelters to the soldiers running out of food.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Di lala di tsamaya bosigo.** While true, this is about *when* they forage, not *why* they build shelters.
*   **C: Megwantlo e, e nna e tsaya lebaka la malatsi a tla nna 17.** This states the duration of the migration, not the reason for the construction of shelters.
*   **D: Di bothologa motshegare** This is incorrect as masole a ditshoswane a lala a tsamaya bosigo mme e re motshegare a ikhutse.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mafoko a fe a a bontshang sentle gore setlhopa sa masole a ditshoswane se aga manno  a nakwana, a a agiwang sesha tsatsi  le letsatsi?","The correct answer is **C: Di fetola mesima ya bone letsatsi le letsatsi**.

The passage states: ""Ka nako eo, masole a aga manno a nakwana, a a agiwang sesha tsatsi le letsatsi."" This translates to ""At that time, the soldiers build temporary shelters that are rebuilt daily."" Option C, ""Di fetola mesima ya bone letsatsi le letsatsi"" directly reflects this meaning.
"
Ke eng mo go tse di latelang di tlile go tswelela le fa go na le dilo tse dingwe tse di diregang ko ntle?,"The correct answer is **B: Meribo ya nako le nako.**

Here's why:

*   **P (Premise):** States that many realize the body and behavior depend on genetics and its evolution over time. It also notes that *circadian rhythms* (Meribo ya nakwana, e e sa bakweng fela ke tse di diragalang kwa ntle) are well-documented in many organisms and can *continue self-regulating even without external stimuli*.

*   **Q (Question):** Asks what will continue even when external things are happening.

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The passage explicitly states that circadian rhythms (meribo ya nakwana) can continue even without external stimuli.
    *   Option A, ""Dilo tse di diragalang mo teng ga tsone"" (Things that happen inside them), is too broad. While internal processes are important, the passage focuses specifically on rhythms.
    *   Option C, ""Dinako tsa tlholego"" (natural times), is also too general. While related, it does not directly address the rhythmicity described in the passage.
    *   Option D, ""Meribo e e lebeletsweng"" (expected rhythms) is too vague and doesn't have any reference point in the prompt.

**Therefore, meribo ya nako le nako (circadian rhythms) aligns most closely with the information provided in the text, specifically the ability to persist independent of external factors.**"
Ke lefoko lefe le le tlhalosang mongwe le mongwe yo o bontshang ditshwano tsa mokgwa tse di farologaneng?,"The correct answer is **C: Ditshedi**.

The passage describes organisms (ditshedi) that display different characteristics. The term ""polymorphic"" refers to this variety in phenotypic traits.
"
Ke mafoko afe a a tshwanang a detshedi tse di dulang mo lefelong le le rileng?,"The correct answer is **B: Palo ya batho**.

The paragraph describes a population, and ""palo ya batho"" translates to ""population"" in Setswana. The other options don't fit the context:

*   **A: Dilo di direga ka tsela e e tshwanang** (Things happen in a similar way) - While true within a population, it's not the definition of a population.
*   **C: Ditshedi** (Living things) - Too broad; a population is a *specific group* of living things.
*   **D: Medumo e e tshwanang** (Similar sounds) - Completely unrelated.
"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang o kare ga e se sekai sa tiro ya tlhago ya bojanala?,"All the options listed are examples of nature tourism. Therefore, the question is flawed.

However, if I *had* to choose the least strong example of nature tourism from the list, it would arguably be **D: Go tshwara tlhapi (Fishing)**.

Here's why:

*   While fishing *can* be a nature-based activity, it's often driven more by the *desire to catch a fish* than specifically appreciating the natural environment itself. It can even have negative environmental impacts if not managed sustainably.
*   The other options (waterfall trips, photographing wildflowers, visiting parks) all have a stronger emphasis on observing and appreciating nature.

Therefore, the answer is **D**."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e leng motheo wa tsamaiso ya dipalangwa?","The correct answer is **B: Dikoloi tsa beng (Private cars)**.

The paragraph explicitly states: ""Mo sepalamong se se tlhabolotseng thata se, batho botlhe ba na le kamano le mafaratlhatlha a mesepele a a dirisang dikoloi tsa beng..."" which translates to ""In this highly developed transportation system, all people have a relationship with the travel infrastructure that uses private cars..."" This directly indicates private cars are a foundation of the transport system described.
"
Dilwana tse di dikologileng nutlease di na le mofuta ofe wa maatla?,"The passage states that electrons have a negative charge. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: Ga di a tlhatlhelwa**

This is because electrons have a negative charge and they are being said that they are not charged."
Nutlease e nale dilwana dife?,"The correct answer is **A: Di-neutron le di-proton**.

The passage clearly states, ""Togwa e na le dikarolo di le pedi - di-neutron le di-proton."" which translates to ""The nucleus has two parts - neutrons and protons.""
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e leng sekai sa nomore e e nang le dinomore tse pedi tse tlhano?","Karabo e nepagetseng ke **A: 1010**

Serapa se tlhalosa gore dinomore tsa baenari di dirisa didijiti tse pedi fela: 0 le 1. Ke yone fela mo dikgethong tse di fa godimo e e dirisang 0 le 1 fela.
"
Dinomore tse di nang le dinomore tse pedi di bidiwa eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Manathwana (Bits)**.

The passage states that the numbers used in binary code (the language of computers) have only two digits, 0 or 1, and these digits are called ""dinomoro tse di kgaoganyang fa o dirisa puo ya di khomphutara"".  ""Manathwana"" is the translation of ""bits"" in Setswana, which is the correct term for binary digits.
"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang tse go sa buiwang ka tsone mo serapeng jaaka e le tse di solegelang molemo moithuti yo o nang le taeari ya inthanete?,"The correct answer is **B: Phokotsego ya go tshwaiwa phoso ke dithaka**.

While the passage mentions that students try to improve their writing to *avoid* criticism from peers (P: ""Ka go re baithuti ga ntsi ke bone ba ba kgalang thata, mokwadi o leka go kwala botoka go re a seka a kgalwa.""), it doesn't directly state that blogs *reduce* peer criticism.  Instead, it suggests the *fear* of criticism is a motivator. The other options are directly supported by the text:

*   **A: Tokafatso ya bokgoni jwa thutapuo le go kwala:** Explicitly mentioned: ""Gape di-blog di thusa go tokafatsa go kwala ga baithuti. Fa ga ntsi baithuti ba simolola maitemogelo a bone a blog ka thutapuo le mopeleto o o botlhaswa, ga ntsi go nna teng ga batho ba bangwe go fetola seo.""
*   **C: Go lemoga thata ka se se diregang mo tikologong:** Explicitly mentioned: ""Gape go kwala mo inthaneteng go """"dira go re baithuti ba nne botlhale ba itse se diragalang mo lefatseng le le ba dikologileng"""".""
*   **D: Koketsego ya keletso ya go batla go tswelapele go ithuta:** Explicitly mentioned: ""Go kwala ka sengwe go tiisa tirisano-mmogo, le go kgothatsa bana ba sekolo go oketsa go ithuta thata go fetisa jaaka go tlwaelesegile ka letsatsi la thuto.""

Therefore, option B is the only one that is *not* explicitly mentioned as a benefit.
"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang tsa dikarolo tsa go dira taeari mo ithaneteng e e bontshiwang e tlhotlheletsa moithuti go tokafatsa bokgoni jwa bone jwa go kwala?,"The best answer is **C: Go baya leitlho kgatlhego ya babadi** (Monitoring reader interest).

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that the need to please the audience motivates students to be more intelligent and engaging in their writing (""Tlhokego ya itumedisa babogedi e tlhotlheletsa go re baithuti ba nne botlhale e bile ba kgatlhise""). This directly connects to monitoring reader interest.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Go araba dilo tse di mo inthaneteng ganngwe le gape** (Replying to things online often): While replying is part of blogging, the passage doesn't specifically link *frequent* replies to writing improvement. The key is the *quality* of the writing due to audience awareness.
*   **B: Go batla go itlhokomolosa go tshwaya diphoso** (Wanting to ignore criticism): This is the *opposite* of what the passage suggests. The passage says students try to write better *to avoid* criticism.
*   **D: Go batla go dirisana** (Wanting to collaborate): While the passage mentions cooperation, it's not the primary driver for *improving writing skills*. The motivation to avoid criticism and engage the audience is stronger.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate reflection of the passage's explanation for how blogging improves students' writing."
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang tse di sa tsweleng mosola tsa puisano e e sa diregeng ka nako e e tshwanang ya baithuti? ,"Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **B: Go bua le molaedi ba lebane mo matlhong ka nako nngwe le nngwe ya letsatsi.**

Lebaka:

*   **Puisano e e sa diregeng ka nako e e tshwanang** e kaya gore batho ga ba buisane ka nako e le nngwe. Go bua le molaedi ba lebane mo matlhong go tlhoka gore ba nne teng ka nako e le nngwe.
*   **Go dirisa inthanete jaaka motswedi, Go fetofetoga ga diura tsa go dira, le Go laola lobelo** ke melemo e e tlhalositsweng ya puisano e e sa diregeng ka nako e e tshwanang mo temaneng."
"Go ya ka temana e, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang tsa puisano e e sa diregeng ka nako e e tshwanang, e e sa fetogeng go rekegela baithuti?","The correct answer is **A: Lobelo lwa go ithuta**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that asynchronous communication ""allows students to work at their own time, and to control the pace of the learning process."" This directly links asynchronous communication to the flexibility of learning pace.

Let's examine the other options:

*   **B: Diura tsa tiro:** While asynchronous communication might offer some flexibility in *when* students work, the text primarily focuses on the flexibility of *learning* at their own pace. The question is directly linked to the students, not workers
*   **C: Dibuka tsa ditaelo:** The passage doesn't mention instruction manuals.
*   **D: Tiriso ya inthanete:** The internet is *used* in asynchronous communication, but the advantage is that students can use it to learn at their own pace."
"Ga go a umakiwa eng mo temaneng e, se motho a ka se golaganyang le dikago tsa bogologolo?","The correct answer is **B: Metshameko (Metshameko)**.

The passage mentions batshameki ba batlhabani (warrior players), mekete e megolo (grand festivals), and batlhabani ba motlha wa ga Arthur (Arthurian knights) all related to castles. It also mentions megogoro ya ntlo-lehitshwana (towers of a castle). Games are not mentioned directly."
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e sa umakiwang mo serapeng jaaka monkgo kgotsa modumo o o kgonang go diriwa jaaka kgakgamatso mo matlotleng a dikago tsa bogologolo?,"The correct answer is **A: Dintwa**.

The paragraph mentions the following sensory impressions associated with ancient castle ruins:

*   **Medumo** (sounds) of past battles
*   **Go kiba ga tlhako** (the sound of hooves) on stones
*   **Go nkgelwa ke letsholo** (the smell of the camp)

The paragraph does not mention ""dintwa"" (wars) as a smell or sound that one might imagine in the ruins. ""Letshogo"" (fear), while not explicitly stated as a smell or sound, could be related to a smell from the camp, and ""Mediro"" (medals) aren't a smell or sound at all. So the best answer is ""Dintwa"" (wars) as it's the only one that isn't mentioned as a sensory impression."
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e tlhalosang sentle Kago ya bogologolo ya ga Kirby Muxloe?,"The correct answer is **B: Go ne go tlhokega kago ya phemelo e nnye ka ntlha ya tlhago e e kagiso ya naga eo ka nako ya fa e ne e agiwa**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""e bile tshireletso e ne e tlhokega fela kgatlhanong le setlhotshwana sa digongwana tse di ebelang le go tsamaya di senya,"" meaning only a small amount of defence was needed because the country was mostly at peace.
*   Option A is incorrect because the text implies the walls were thin, not thick.
*   Option C is incorrect, while it may be true that the design was not unusual, it does not answer the question directly, which is which of the statements *best* describes the building.
*   Option D is the opposite of what the passage suggests. It explicitly says the castle wouldn't withstand a serious attack."
Ke efe ya dikarolo tsa kago tse di latelang di neng di tsewa e le tse di sa tlwaelegang mo go Kagong ya bogologolo ya ga Kirby Muxloe ka nako e e tlhalosiwang mo serapeng?,"The correct answer is **A: Difensetere tse dikgolo** and **D: Mabota a masesane**.

The paragraph explicitly states that ""Difenstere tsa yone tse di tona le mabota a a masesanyane, ne di ka seke tsa kgona go emelela tlhaselo e e mashetla lebaka le le leele."" This implies that large windows and thin walls were unusual for a defensive structure, which is what a castle usually was.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e ne e se mosola fa motabogi a ne a ipaakanyetsa paka e e tlang?","The correct answer is **A: Go ikatisetsa motabogo wa naga ka selemo**.

Here's why:

*   The paragraph mentions cross-country running in the *winter* as beneficial preparation. Running cross-country in the summer is not mentioned as beneficial.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: O tsepamisitse mogopolo mo lobelong fa a ikatisa:** The paragraph states that speed becomes less important as the distance increases, so focusing *only* on speed during training for longer distances would not be ideal.
*   **C: Go taboga ko tlase ga metsotso e e meraro ya nako:** The paragraph implies that a good half-mile runner would be running closer to two minutes. Thus, this is indeed something a runner would benefit from.
*   **D: Go dirisa lefelo la go ikatisa mmele o o ko godimo:** The paragraph explicitly mentions upper-body workouts as a good form of preparation.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e botlhokwa thata mo phaposing ya ntlha mo motaboging yo o sa tabogeng sekgala se se leele thata?","The correct answer is **D: Go lwela go taboga ka lebelo ka boitshoko**.

Here's why:

*   The paragraph states that as the race distance increases (from a quarter mile to a half mile), speed becomes less important, and strength and endurance become key.
*   It also mentions that while a runner who can complete a half mile in under two minutes must have speed, endurance is essential and must be cultivated.

Options A, B, and C are not the most accurate representation of what the paragraph emphasizes. Option A speaks about preparing for the running season, and option B and C talks about achieving a specific time. Hence, Option D is the only option that talks about speed and endurance."
"Go motabogi, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e se kitlang e kgona go fitlhelelwa fela ka go ja dijo tse di nang le dikotla?","The correct answer is **C: Tiragatso ya maemo a a ko godimo (High-level performance)**.

The passage states that ""Go ja dijo tse di nang le dikotla ka bogone fela go ka seka ga dira go re o diragatse sentle, mme go ka dira go ka ama thata boitekanelo ka kakaretso jwa batsayakarolo ba metshameko ba ba saleng basha.""

This means:

*   Eating nutritious food alone is not enough to ensure good performance. It only highly affects general health.
*   Factors like maintaining energy balance, hydration, and understanding nutrient timing are also necessary to improve performance and enjoyment.

Therefore, while nutritious food is essential for general health (D) and can contribute to enjoyment (B), it is not *sufficient* for achieving high-level performance (C). Option A is covered under the factors that the passage states are needed to help athletes improve performance.

High-level performance requires additional strategies beyond just a nutritious diet."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e sa umakiwang jaaka tsela e motabogi yo o monnye a ka bonang boitumelo thata mo motshamekong o a o tshamekang?","The correct answer is **B: Go nna ka gale a taboga ka tsela e e kwa godimo**.

The paragraph mentions:

*   **A: Go ikatisa go ja dijo tse di nang le dikotla (Eating a nutritious diet):** ""...go ja dijo tse di nang le dikotla ka bogone...""
*   **C: Go nwa metsi thata (Staying hydrated):** ""...go nna le mekgwa e e berekang ya go nwa metsi..."" (effective hydration habits)
*   **D: Go nna a nale maatla a itekanyetseng a a siameng (Maintaining proper energy levels):** ""Go boloka tekano e e itekanetseng ya maatla..."" (maintaining a proper energy balance).

The paragraph does NOT mention anything about ""Go nna ka gale a taboga ka tsela e e kwa godimo.""
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke ka ntlha yang motabogi yo o tabogang mo sekgala se se mo magareng a reka sedirisiwa sa tlhwatlhwa e e kwa godimo?","The correct answer is **A: Ke seo ba se batlang**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Batsayakarolo ba metshameko ba ka nna ba ikutlwa e ka re ba rata setlhagiswa se se rileng le fa se sena mesola epe mo go bone."" This directly means that athletes might buy things simply because they *want* them, even if they don't improve performance.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: E bontshitswe e solegela molemo:** The passage implies the opposite - that many accessories don't actually have a real benefit.
* **C: E tlile go dira gore ba kgone go taboga:** The passage says that most of the equipment will not have an impact on their performance.
* **D: Go nale dipuo tse di sa tlhomamang ka didirisiwa tse e seng tsa tlhwatlhwa e e ko godimo:** The passage doesn't emphasize rumors about the equipment but rather focuses on the athlete's perception and desire for certain products, regardless of their actual value or benefit.

Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer based on the given text."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se batabogi ba ba tabogang sekgala se se mo magareng ba se tlhokang?","The correct answer is **C: Didirisiwa tse mmalwa thata**.

Here's why:

* The paragraph states that middle-distance running is not a high-cost sport.
* It also mentions that ""dilo di ka rekwa go ya ka mo di tlhokegang ka teng, mme bontsi jwa tsone bo ka se nne le tshusumetso epe mo tiragatsong."" This translates to ""things can be bought according to what is needed, but most of them will not have any impact on performance.""  This implies that very few essentials are actually needed for performance.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di dirisiwa tse mmalwa:** While some equipment is needed, the passage emphasizes it's not much.
* **B: Ba tshwanetse go nna le kitso ka go taboga:** While knowledge about running is helpful, the paragraph is specifically focused on *equipment*.
* **D: Madi a mantsi:** The first sentence directly contradicts this by saying it's not a high-cost sport.
"
Ke mang a boneng kgogego ya makenete ya nutlia? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch le Purcell**.

The passage states: ""MRI e berekela mo maranyaneng a a bidiwang 'nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)', e e lemogilweng mo dingwageng tsa bo-1930 ke Felix Bloch (wa Stanford University) le Edward Purcell (wa Harvard University).""
"
Ke ka ngwaga o feng go ne gwa newa patente ya ntlha ya kgogedi ya setshwantsho sa kalafi? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

The text states: ""Morago ga dingwaga di le dine phethente e ne ya ntshiwa, e e neng e le ya ntlha mo lefatsheng ya MRI. Ka ngwaga wa 1970, Raymond Damadian...o lemogile lobakala wa go dirisa ”magnetic resonance imaging”..."".  Therefore, the patent was issued four years *after* 1970.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se batho ba tshwanetseng go se tlhaloganya gore ba kgone go itse ditiro tsa nama tse di diriwang ke batho ba bangwe?","The correct answer is **B: Maitlhomo (Intentions)**.

The passage explicitly states that understanding the intentions of others (""Go tlhaloganya maikaelelo a ba bangwe go botlhokwa thata"") is crucial for resolving uncertainty about behavior and understanding why someone might do something. The example given highlights how the same action (breaking a car window) can be interpreted differently based on the person's intention.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, go tlhaloganaya maitlhomo go thusa batho gore ba dire eng?","The correct answer is **A: Go ntsha maisaitsiweng a a mo morago ga ditiro tsa nama.**

Here's why:

*   The paragraph states that understanding intentions helps us ""rarabolole go sa tlhomamang go go ka tliswang ke boitshwaro"" which translates to ""resolve the uncertainty that can be brought by behavior."" This directly relates to understanding the ""maisaitsiweng"" (mysteries/unknowns) behind physical actions.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Go bonela pele dikeletso (To predict desires):** While understanding intentions might *inform* predictions about desires, the primary function described in the paragraph is about understanding *why* someone is acting a certain way, not necessarily predicting what they *want*.
*   **C: Go leba batho ba bangwe ntle le go ba tlhaola (To look at other people without discriminating):** The text doesn't specifically mention discrimination. It focuses on understanding the motivations behind actions.
*   **D: Go bala ditlhaloganyo tsa ba bangwe (To read other people's minds):** While the first sentence refers to the human ability to ""read minds,"" the focus then narrows to understanding intentions as a *part* of that larger ability. The paragraph specifically emphasizes how understanding intentions helps resolve ambiguity in behavior.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e tlhalosang sentle tshobokanyo ya mosola wa AI?","The best answer is **D: Go itirela tiro**.

Here's why:

* **The paragraph emphasizes AI's ability to automate tasks that require intelligence.** The core idea is creating machines capable of performing tasks that usually need human intelligence. This aligns directly with ""Go itirela tiro"" (to automate).
* While options A, B, and C are mentioned in the passage, they are examples of AI capabilities, whereas option D is the underlying principle and main purpose of the creation of AI.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e AI gantsi amangwang le yone?","The correct answer is **C: Tlhamane ya saense** (Science fiction).

The passage explicitly states: ""Le fa AI e gokaganngwa thata le mainane a maranyane..."" which translates to ""Although AI is often associated with science fiction...""
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e leng maatla a mongwe yo o kgonang go akanya a tsepamisitse mogopolo?","The correct answer is **D: O kgona go tshwarelela dipopego ka tlhogo.**

The passage states: ""Batho ba ba nang le tlhaloganyo e ntseng jaana ba akanya sentle, ba kgona go tshwara dilo ka tlhogo ba sa lebale, go rarabolola mathata le go dira ka diteko tsa saense."" This directly mentions the ability to memorize and retain information, which includes figures.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: O kgona go bona dikarabo tse dintsi mo bothateng:** The passage says focused thinking believes there's only ONE true answer, the opposite of this.
*   **B: O kgona go dirisa ditsela tse disha mo bothateng:** Focused thinking relies on existing systems and knowledge, not new approaches.
*   **C: O tsaya nako go rarabolola mathata:** The passage mentions speed (""lebelo"") as a characteristic, suggesting the opposite of taking a long time.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e motho yo o kgonang go akanya a tsepamisitse monagano a sa tsepamisang monagano mo go yone?","The answer is **B: Go tsaya nako ya gagwe**.

Here's why:

* **The paragraph states:** ""Tsepamo ya menagano e ke lebelo..."" (Focus of thinking is speed...)

The other options are all mentioned as characteristics of a focused mindset in the paragraph:

* **A:** ""Kgangkgolo ya tlhaloganyo ke: go na le karabo fela e le nngwe e e leng boammaruri."" (Central point of reasoning is: there is only one true answer.)
* **C:** ""Tsepamo ya menagano e ke...go lemoga mabaka..."" (Focus of thinking is...recognizing facts...)
* **D:** ""Tsepamo ya menagano e ke...go batlana le kitso."" (Focus of thinking is...searching for knowledge...)

Therefore, taking one's time is the opposite of ""lebelo"" (speed), meaning it's something someone with a focused mindset would *not* prioritize.

"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang, e e tsewang e le go ntsha maikutlo a mannye?","The passage states that video recording has led to important discoveries in understanding subtle expressions and facial movements that occur in fractions of a second. While the passage doesn't explicitly define each option as a microexpression, it implies that these are small, fleeting facial movements. Of the options given:

*   **B: Go tsholetsa dintshi (Raising eyebrows)** is the most likely answer, as it is a small, quick facial movement that could be considered a microexpression.

So the answer is **B**."
Ke efe ya mafoko a a latelang a a tlhalosang go ntsha maikutlo a mannye e seng boammaruri?,"The best answer is **D: E ka thusa go lebelela gore a go tswa pelong**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage implies micro-expressions are related to truthfulness.** The passage focuses on using micro-expressions to detect deception. This directly connects to whether someone is being genuine or ""go tswa pelong"". The whole point of the passage is that these minute movements reveal underlying emotions, potentially revealing whether someone is lying.
*   **Other options are too broad:**
    *   A: While video recordings led to discoveries about micro-expressions, this doesn't necessarily mean that their purpose is to find if it is a lie.
    *   B: While the passage does imply that an accurate reading of microexpressions can detect lies, it does not tell about if the detection is a truth or a lie
    *   C: Puo le tebego ya sefatlhego e ka tlhalosiwa does not imply any detection between a truth or a lie

Therefore, option D is the most relevant to the question of accurately discerning truthfulness/sincerity from micro-expressions."
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e nnileng ya botlhokwa ka ntlha ya Tsosoloso? ,"The passage states that ""the ability to recall information became the main element"" and that the ""age of civilisation"" changed ""the way we learn and the way we spread knowledge"". Therefore, both recalling information and spreading knowledge became important. However, of the choices given, **C: Go gakologelwa molaetsa (Recalling information)** is the most direct and best answer based on the text. Option B is partly correct, but C is a closer match.
"
"Ka ntlha ya Tsosoloso, ga go a gatelela efe ya dilo tse di latelang?","Kgang-tlhaloso e bolela gore pele ga Tsosoloso, kgatelelo e ne e le mo go gakologelweng dilo o le esi. Morago ga Tsosoloso, kgatelelo e ne ya fudugela mo go kgoneng go gakologelwa molaetsa le go kgona go bona tshedimosetso.

"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e sa kayeng tlhotlheletso ya go dirisa inthanete go tsweledisa botsalano?,"The correct answer is **A: Go itsalanya ka tsa kgwebo (To associate with businesses)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions ""go tsalana le batho (socializing)"" and ""go tsweledisiwa wa dikamano (maintenance of relationships)"" as motivations for using the internet. Option D, ""Go kopana le batho ba basha (Meeting new people)"" is similar to ""go tsalana le batho."" Option B, ""Go tswelediwa ga dikamano (maintenance of relationships)"" is directly mentioned. Option C, ""Go batla tshedimosetso ka leeto"" (Seeking information about travel) is not directly related to fostering relationships

*   ""Go itsalanya ka tsa kgwebo (To associate with businesses)"" is primarily focused on commercial or business activities and doesn't necessarily involve personal relationships or social connection.

Therefore, A is the answer choice that does not refer to an influence to use the internet to foster friendship."
"Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang, e e sa kayeng tlhotlheletso ya go dirisa inthanete go itsenyaletsa?","The passage mentions:

*   Learning (""go ithuta"")
*   Socializing (""go tsalana le batho"")
*   Personal involvement (""kamego ya botho"")
*   Relationship continuation (""go tsweledisiwa wa dikamano"")

Let's see how the options align:

*   B: Go tlhaeletsana ga batho (Socializing/communication) - aligns with ""go tsalana le batho""
*   A: Go batlana le tsela ya go apaya (Searching for a recipe) - could be linked to learning or personal involvement depending on context, so not necessarily only about self-interest
*   C: Go batlana le didirisiwa tsa kalafi (Searching for medical devices) - Could be linked to personal involvement, but it is more to do with seeking for personal medical assistance

The option that does NOT directly reflect a self-involved motive based on the list in the passage is D: Go leba tsamaiso ya tsa ditšhelete (Checking financial management). This could be related to work, family, or other responsibilities beyond pure self-gratification.

Therefore, the answer is **D: Go leba tsamaiso ya tsa ditšhelete**."
Ke leng fa Bophirima jwa Yuropa bo neng jwa lesa go ikamaganya thata le tlhotlheletso ga mmogo le go simolola kapari ya yone?,"The correct answer is **A: Middle Ages se ya fifing**.

The passage states: ""Fa sebaka se se bidiwang Middle Ages se ya fifing, mafatshe a bophirima ja Yuropa a ne a simolola go itlhamela kapari ya bone."" This directly answers the question of when Western Europe started developing its own fashion instead of relying on outside influence.
"
Go dirisa dikonopo go kopela diaparo go nnile le ditlamorago tsa eng? ,"The correct answer is **C: Ka nako ya dintwa tsa tumelo**.

The passage states that one of the developments of the time (Middle Ages), *as a result of* the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothing. Therefore, the use of buttons is linked to the time of the Crusades.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang e bonweng e le tharabololo e e dirileng sebaka se se leele ya mathata a tsa tikologo?","The passage argues that addressing the *cause* of the problem is the long-term solution, rather than just treating the symptoms. Option C, ""Go bona gore ke eng se se bakang mathata"" (Finding out what causes the problems), directly reflects this idea.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C**.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya ditharabololo ya dilo tse di latelang e e bontshiwang e le kalafi e e bonalang ya mathata a tsa tikologo?","The correct answer is **B: Go bona sesosa sa mathata**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that addressing environmental issues by joining organizations or becoming an advocate is like treating the symptoms of a disease rather than the disease itself.
*   It then explicitly says, ""Mme, fa re sa batle fela tharabololo ya nakwana, re tshwanetse go bona sesosa sa mathata, mme re tshwanetse go se fedisa"" which translates to ""But, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we must find the cause of the problem and eliminate it.""
*   Therefore, finding the root cause of the problems is presented as the more effective solution to environmental issues.

The other options are related to the discussion but are either described as temporary fixes or are causes of the issues, not solutions."
Ke naga efe e Yuropa e neng ya nna le ntwa ya ntlha e mathata a yone a konokono e neng gotwe a nyalana le go dirisa sentle maatla ntle le go tsenyeletsa ba bodumedi?,"The answer is **D: Spain**.

The passage states: ""Ntwa ya Boswa-ja-puso ya Spain ke yone ya ntlha e go neng go lwelwa dithata tsa go busa. Se se ne e tshwaya nako ya phetogo ya bothokwa, mo mafatshe a Yuropa a ka seke a tlhola a lwa dintwa mo leineng la tumelo."" This directly translates to ""The War of the Spanish Succession was the first fought for power. This marked an important transitional period where European countries would no longer fight wars in the name of religion.""
"
Ke ntwa efe e e mo gongwe e tlhalosiwang jaaka ‘ntwa ya bodumedi’?,"The passage states that the ""Thirty Years' War"" was the last war to be called a war of religion.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Ntwa ya Dingwaga di le Masome a mararo**
"
Ke dilo dife tse di latelang tsa Kereke ya Katoliki tse di neng di sa tlhatlhobiwa?,"The passage focuses on the questioning of the Catholic Church's practices, specifically regarding its wealth and power in relation to its stated beliefs. Based on the prompt provided, the most accurate answer is:

**A: Fa go bewa ga khumo ya Kereke e ne e siame**

**Reasoning:**

*   The passage states, ""kgobokanngwa gono ga maatla le madi mo lefelong le le nosi go ile ga dira go re bontsi bo ipotse go re a mme tumelo eno e a diragadiwa."" This directly relates to the accumulation of wealth by the Church and whether it aligned with its teachings about using resources to alleviate suffering.

The other options are not as directly supported by the passage:

*   **B: Fa ditheo tsa konokono di ne di fetolwa:** The passage does not mention any changing in the essential teachings of the church.
*   **C: Go tsenelela ga maatla mo teng ga Kereke:** While the passage mentions the Church's power, it doesn't primarily focus on questioning the depth of its power.
*   **D: Fa ditheo tsa konokono tsa Kereke di ne di diriwa ka moo go tshwanetseng:** The passage does not mention whether the essential institutions of the Church were functioning as they should.

"Go ya ka serapa, Ke mang yo o bolailweng ko Versailles?","The correct answer is **D: Motlhokomedi**.

The paragraph states: ""Ka nako e nngwe lekolo la mogoso le ile a tsikinya tlhogo ya motlhokomedi wa segosi yo o neng a bolawa kwa Versailles fa pele ga Kgosigadi e e neng e tshogile thata."" This clearly indicates that a guard (motlhokomedi) was killed at Versailles.
"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e neng e sa patelediwa mo Kgosing le mo Kgosigading ya segopa?,"The correct answer is **C: Go lebiwa ga go kgaolwa tlhogo ga motlhokomedi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states a group of people shook a guard's head that was beheaded.
*   Therefore, the Queen was not forced to view the beheading.

The other options are directly stated as actions the King and Queen were forced to endure:

*   **A: Go bulwa ga difensetere tsa karana** - ""Segopa sa batho se ne sa pateletsa Kgosi le Kgosigadi go tlogela matlhabaphefo a leteroko a atlhame.""
*   **B: Go tswa botlhaswa mo Versailles** - ""Kgosigadi Marie Antoinette le bana ba bone ba ba nnye (...) ba ne ba patelediwa go boela Paris, go tswa Versallies, ke segopa sa basadi""
*   **D: Leeto la go boela Paris** - ""Ba ne ba patelediwa go boela Paris, go tswa Versallies."""
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e eneng e se matswela a ntwa ya sesole sa lewatle e e sa tlwaelegang ya Boritane?,"The passage states that Britain's naval blockade resulted in:

*   Interruption of important military and civilian supplies.
*   Endangering neutral ships.
*   Germany seeking a similar response in its unrestricted submarine warfare.

The passage does not mention changes to international law. Thus, the correct answer is:

**C: Diphetogo tse di dirilweng tsa molao wa lefatshe**"
Ke efe ya dilo tse go buiwang ka tsone fano e e sa tlhaloseng thibego ya sesole sa lewatle kgatlhanong le Jeremane?,"The correct answer is **D: E ile ya netefatsa gore dikepe tse e seng karolo ya ntwa di se ke tsa tshosediwa.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering, ""putting even neutral ships at risk."" This directly contradicts option D.

The other options are supported by the text:

*   **A: E ne e sa tsamaisane le molao wa lefatshe:** The passage explicitly says the blockade ""violated the generally followed international law.""
*   **B: E ne e gakatsa ntwa ya Majeremane ya mo tlase ga lewatle:** The passage mentions that because of the limited response to Britain's actions, Germany expected a similar lack of response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
*   **C: E ne e kgoreletsa motsamao wa dilwana tsa Jeremane:** The passage states the blockade ""cut off vital military and civilian supplies."""
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mang yo o neng a ka nna le Multiple Sclerosis thata?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **A: Mosadi wa dingwaga tse 32**.

"
"Go ya ka serapa, batsayakarolo mo ditirong tsa ka gale tse di batlang tshegetso e e kwa godimo ya eng?","The correct answer is **A: Ga ba nne le ditlhabi** (They don't have pain).

The paragraph states that ""Bao ba tsayang karolo mo ditirong tsa ka gale ba ne ba tlhoka tshegetso e e oketsegileng mabapi le dikakanyo tse di sa siamang kaga go utlwa botlhoko ba bona."" This translates to ""Those who participate in regular activities needed more support regarding the negative thoughts about their pain."" Therefore, the participants needed help with dealing with their pain, implying they do experience pain.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, go bewa ga legora gantsi go tshamekiwa jang?","The best answer is **D: Gantsi**.

Here's why:

* **P** states, ""Motshameko ga ntsi o tshamekiwa ke batho bale ba bedi ba lwantshana"" which translates to ""The game is often played by two people fighting."" Thus the closest answer to this is **gantsi (often)**.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang e le letshwao le le tseneletseng ya botlhole jo bo moteng?","The correct answer is **D: sejana se se bulegileng sa melemo**.

Here's why:

*   The paragraph describes internal poisoning being difficult to detect because initial symptoms can be common.
*   It then gives an example of a potential source of internal poison - an open container of medicine and household cleaning products. The open container is a stronger indicator of potential poisoning than vomiting alone, which could be from many causes.
* Vomiting can be caused by food poisoning, which is common and not always poisoning."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke kgato efe e e tshwanetseng ya ntlha fa o tlhatlhoba motho yo o amegileng?","The correct answer is **B: Sekaseka gore a mme ga o mo diphatsheng**.

The passage clearly states that the first step in assessing an injured person is to make sure *you* are safe.

"
Ke diphetogo dife tse di batliwang thata ke Tshenolo ya SeFora e neng e nale thotloetso thata mo badiring?,"The correct answer is **C: Go gapiwa ga kgopolo ya Rephaboliki** (The seizing of the idea of a Republic).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that one of the political benefits of the French Revolution was ""phetogo ya go tswa go puso ya bobusaesi go ya go puso ya riphaboliki"" (the transition from a monarchy to a republic).
*   The last sentence mentions that the revolution inspired other oppressed populations to revolt against their governments. This aligns with the seizing of the Republic idea that the people should govern and not a monarch.

The other options are not as directly supported by the text:

*   **A: Tshegetso e e tswang ko godimo ya setšhaba** (Top-down support of the nation) - While the revolution led to national identity, the passage focuses on changes in governance and opportunity, not necessarily top-down support.
*   **B: Go ntsha mogopolo go tswa mo bathong go ya ko kgaisanong** (Removing the idea from people to competition) - The passage discusses increased opportunities based on merit, but not about removing ideas from people to competition.
*   **D: Tsmaiso e ntšhwa ya go lekantsha** (New measurement system) - The system of measurements mentioned in the passage is not related to the influence it has on the workers."
"Go latelana le Tshenolo ya Fora, katlego mo masoleng le ditiro tse dingwe tse di ne di beilwe mo go eng?","The correct answer is **A: Phitlhelelo (Achievement)**.

The passage states that after the French Revolution, military ranks depended on ""bokgoni"" which translates to ability or achievement, not social standing. ""Ditiro di ne tsa bulegela bakopi ba tiro ba banna botlhe mme seo sa dira go re bao ba ikaeletseng go atlega le go feta le bao ba atlegang ba tswelele pele mo botshelong. Go ne ga diragala se se tshwanang le ka sesole ka go nne mo boemong jwa go re maemo a bosole a ikaege ka go re o na le maemo afe mo sechabeng a ne jaanong a ikaegile ka bokgoni.""
"
Ke tirelo efe ya setšhaba e gotweng ke yone e bakang go sa kgotsofale mo dinageng tse di tlhabologileng?,"The correct answer is **C: Dipalangwa tsa botlhe**

Here's why:

*   The prompt mentions that ""Everyone participates in society and all use public facilities. Most people complain about public facilities.""
*   The paragraph also mentions that people complain about public services more than something specific like ""the quality of water or the collapse of bridges in developed countries"".
*   The prompt then asks, ""Why are people not happy with public facilities, why do they fail with such weight every day?""
*   The question asks ""Which public service is said to cause dissatisfaction in developed countries?""
*   Although water quality (A) and bridge collapses (B) can be issues, the question is related to dissatisfaction in developed countries, not necessarily any negative effect. Option C, ""Dipalangwa tsa botlhe"" (Public transport), is the most general public service from the options provided, implying dissatisfaction in developed countries.
*   ""Thuto"" (Education) is a public service, but is not mentioned in the question.

Therefore, the most direct and accurate answer based on the prompt is public transport."
"Go ya ka serapa, go ka tweng ka tsamaiso ya dipalangwa tsa botlhe?","The best answer is **C: Di baka gore batho ba bantsi ba ba di dirisang ba ngongorege**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Bontsi jwa batho ba ngongoregela dipagamo tsa sechaba."" (Most people complain about public services). This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Botlhe ba dirisa dipagamo tsa sechaba.** (Everyone uses public services) While the passage says ""Mongwe le mongwe o na le seabe mo sechabeng mme botlhe ba dirisa dipagamo tsa sechaba"" (Everyone has a contribution to society and they all use public services), the question asks for the conclusion that can be drawn about the system.
*   **B: Batho ba ikuela ba sa kgwe mathe ka boleng jwa metsi** (People complain bitterly about the quality of water) is specifically related to water quality and is not a general statement about public service systems. It also doesn't mean that they don't complain bitterly about other things.
*   **D: Mo dinageng tse dintsi tse di tlhabologileng** (In many developed countries) - While the passage mentions infrastructure issues in developed countries, this isn't the main point about public services.

Therefore, option C best reflects the main point of the paragraph regarding public service systems."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang e ka nnang boima go e lekantsha ka ntlha ya bakgweetsi ba ba sa itsegeng?","Go ya ka serapa, karabo e nepahetseng ke:

"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e dirisitsweng fa go diriwa dipalo tse di bontshitsweng tsa pharakano?,"The correct answer is **D: Bontsi jwa pharakano** (Bokete kwa dikoloi).

The passage explicitly states: ""Go kgona go fa maduo a a tsepameng ka pharakano ya dikoloi, go amantswe dintlha dikgolo tse tharo: (1) go elela ga dikoloi (2) bokete kwa dikoloi le (3) lobelo la dikoloi."" which translates to ""To be able to give stable results on traffic flow, three major factors are combined: (1) the flow of vehicles (2) the density of vehicles and (3) the speed of vehicles.""

The question asks which of the options is used in calculations of traffic flow. Bokete kwa dikoloi (density of vehicles) is directly mentioned as one of the three major factors used in these calculations.

Bokgoni jwa go fetoga ga dijini tse di fetiseditsweng mo losikeng e ikaegile mo go eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Fa disele tse di amegileng e le tsa losika lwa mogare wa disele.**

The passage clearly states: ""Phetogo ya dilo ya losika mogare wa disele ke yone fela e e kgonang go fetela ko baneng..."" which directly answers the question of what determines if a genetic change can be passed down. Therefore A is correct.
"
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e filweng mo serapeng, ditlamorago tsa diphetogo tse di sa tshwaneng ga di a ikaega ka eng?","The correct answer is **C: Fa diteng tsa botlhokwa tsa dijini di amegileng ka gone**.

The paragraph explicitly states that the impact of mutations depends on:

*   **Mofuta wa phetogo** (Type of mutation) - This corresponds to option D.
*   **Bokao jwa karolo ya togwa ya dijini e e amegileng** (Significance of the affected gene region) - This means how important the portion of the gene sequence that is affected is. This corresponds to option A
*   **Go re a disele tsa mmele tse di amegileng ke tsa losika lwa mogare wa disele** (Whether the affected cells are germline cells) - This corresponds to option B.

Option C, ""Fa diteng tsa botlhokwa tsa dijini di amegileng ka gone"", is similar to option A, but is not as direct as it is not stated in the given excerpt. It can be inferred, but it is not explicitly stated.
Therefore, the best answer is C because the paragraph does not explicitly state the importance of the affected gene."
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e seng lebaka la gobo ditso tsa kgale di ileng tsa boloka dipodi?,"The correct answer is **C: E ne ele ditsala**.

The passage mentions that goats were domesticated for milk, wool, meat, and soft leather. It does not mention them being kept as companions. Therefore, that is the reason least supported by the text.
"
Mokgele wa golofo ke go tsaya eng e nnye?,"The correct answer is **B: Go kgotletsa**.

The passage states: ""Motshameki yo itayang thobanyane ya motshameko makgetho a a kwa tlase go ne le ba bangwe, ke ene mofenyi"" which translates to ""The player who hits the ball the fewest times is the winner"".  Hitting the ball is the same as stroking. Thus, the objective is to minimise the number of strokes.
"
"Mo lebaleng la golofo,  tlhaga e ne e kgaotswe gore e nne khutshwane kae?","The correct answer is **B: Ko botaleng.**

The passage states: ""tlhaga e e gaufi le mosima e kgaolwa bokhutshwane thata mme e bidiwa """"ko botaleng"""".
"
"Ke efe ya mothale yo, e e dirisiwang thata mo dipatlisisong?","The correct answer is **D: Mo dipatlisisong tsa maranyane.**

The question asks which method is used a lot in scientific research. The first sentence in statement P says that computer models are used a lot in scientific research. Option D relates to the research.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se se sa thuseng go batlisisa ka maranyane?","Go ya ka serapa, ga go na sepe se se buang ka gore masole a Ma German ga a thuse go batlisisa ka maranyane.

However, if we interpret the question as ""Which of the options is LEAST related to scientific research in general?"", then:

*   **A: Go dira tsela e nngwe ya saense** (Creating a different way of science) - While innovation is important, simply creating a ""different way"" without a clear purpose may not be helpful.

The other options are generally accepted components of scientific research:

*   **B: Go dira ditshekatsheko** (Doing analysis) - Essential for interpreting data.
*   **C: Go ntsha dikakanyo tse di kgonegang** (Generating possible ideas) - Forming hypotheses.
*   **D: Go dira diteko** (Conducting tests) - Testing hypotheses.

Therefore, the least relevant option, based on a broader interpretation, would be **A**.

**Ka jalo, karabo e e ka nnang e nepagetse thata ke A.**

"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya mafoko a tlhalosang ka ga ditsuatsue e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **C: Bontsi jwa ditsuatsue bo tsaya go feta diura tse tharo**.

Here's why:

* **P** states: ""Ditsuatsue tsa diphefo tse di bogale tsa bokete go gaisa tsa dipesente tse pedi di tsaya dioura di le tharo."" This means only the most extreme 2% last that long, implying the *majority* last *less* than three hours.

The other options are true based on the passage:

* **A: Ditsuatsue di kgona go senya sengwe le sengwe mo di leng gone** - The first sentence says they ""can senya sengwe le sengwe mo tseleng"".
* **B: Ditsuatsue di ama mafelo a mannye go na le diphefo tse dingwe** - The first sentence says they affect smaller areas than other natural events.
* **D: Ditsuatsue tse dingwe di kgona go dikologa go fitlha sekgala sa dikilomitara tse 482 ka ura e le nngwe** - The last sentence says a violent storm has a speed of 480km/h.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya mafoko a a latelang a tlhalosang sentle bontsi jwa ditsuatsue?","The correct answer is **D: Di kgona go ntsha ditlhare go tswa ko meding**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Ditsuatsue tsa diphefo di kumola ditlhare"" which translates to ""Tornadoes uproot trees"". This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Di tsaya sebaka sa diura tse tharo:** The passage mentions that only 2% of the most severe tornadoes last up to three hours, not the majority.
*   **B: Di dikologa dikilomitara tse 772 ka ura e le nngwe:** The text gives an example of a strong tornado with a width of 480 km (speed of 133 m/s; 300mph)
*   **C: Di ama mafelo a mannye go feta diphefo tse dingwe.:** The text states that it affects small areas compared to other natural events, not other winds.

Batho ba ntse ba dirisa didirisiwa tsa go godisa ba dirisa dilense lobaka lo lo kae?,"The answer is **A: Dingwaga tse di sekete.**

Here's why:

*   **P** states that people have used magnifying glasses for thousands of years.
*   **Q** asks how long people have been using magnifying devices (lenses).

Therefore, the answer must reflect the fact that people have used lenses to magnify objects for thousands of years."

*   The passage emphasizes Muhammad's need to be alone in the cave (Hira) to contemplate. The description of the cave highlights its isolation and the lack of worldly distractions, suggesting he valued peace and solitude for spiritual reflection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Modumo wa ko ntle o ka thusa go tlhatlhanya** The passage emphasizes the absence of external noise, which directly contradicts this option.
*   **C: O tlhoka nako e nnye a le nosi** - The passage says he stayed alone for extended periods, suggesting he needed considerable time alone.
*   **D: O ne a tshwenyegile ka go bonwa le go utlwiwa** - While the cave's isolation provided privacy, the passage focuses on the absence of distractions rather than explicitly stating a concern about being seen or heard. The emphasis is on creating a space for contemplation.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, tshipi e ne e dirisediwa eng pele?","The correct answer is **B: Ditsela tsa karaki**

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Mme ne ga lemogwa go re seporo se ka dira botoka fa go na le tshipi fa gadimo."" which translates to ""And it was realised that the railway could work better if there was iron on top."" This indicates that iron was initially used to improve the existing wooden track for carts/wagons.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, gore go ntshitswe maotwana a magong ka maotwana a tshipi?","The correct answer is **D: Di ne di tsofadiwa ke tshipi mo maotong**

The paragraph states that the iron rails were damaging the wooden wheels, leading to the change to iron wheels. This corresponds directly to option D.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se mongwe le mongwe a neng a kgona go se dira ka nako ya Lorato?","Go ya ka serapa, batho ba ne ba kgona go aga **ditlwaelo (C)**. Serapa se tlhalosa gore dingwao tsa lefelo di a tlholwa, di tsena, e bile di a nyalana le lefelo le batho ba teng.
"
Ke efe ya mafoko a a tlhalosang a sa bontsheng kakantsho ya kakaretso ka go tlhomamisega ga thekelonoloji? ,"The correct answer is **A: Ka moo thekenoloji e amang botsalano jwa setshaba ka gone.**

Here's why:

*   **Technical Determinism Core Ideas:**
    *   Technological development follows its own independent path, separate from cultural or political influences.
    *   Technology has inherent effects on society, rather than being shaped by social interactions.
*   Option A is about how technology impacts society, which is an affect (good or bad) of the innovation.
*   Option B suggests that technological development is not affected by culture
*   Option C suggests that technology affects society, which is related to technological determinism
*   Option D suggests that the growth of technology doesn't rely on political influence, related to technological determinism.

Therefore, only option A doesn't express an idea of technical determinism."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang ga di a amana le go goga thapo e e bofilweng?","The correct answer is **B: Letshwao le le tshwanang le seteipole**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Modumo o o sa tsenelelang** - The passage states that ""Up-bow e dira modumo o seng ko godimo"", so this is linked to the up bow technique
*   **C: Modumo o o tseneletseng** - The passage mentions that ""down-bow e le thata e bile o utlwala"", so this is linked to the down bow technique.
*   **D: Go simologa mo segwagweng** - The passage states that ""tlase go raya go re o tshwanetse wa simolola ko segogwaneng"", so this is linked to the down bow technique

The passage explicitly says that the up bow symbol looks like a ""V"" and the down bow symbol looks like a rectangle without one side. Therefore option B is the correct answer."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe e e latelang e amanang le modumo o o siameng?","The correct answer is **A: Letshwao la mo fatshe la thapo e e bofilweng**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Up-bow e dira modumo o seng ko godimo, mme fa **down-bow e le thata e bile o utlwala**."" Down-bow corresponds to the earthbound stroke, also called ""Letshwao la mo fatshe la thapo e e bofilweng."" Therefore, the earthbound stroke corresponds to the correct sound.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Go goga thapo e e bofilweng:** This is too general; ""pulling the bound rope"" does not indicate whether it is pulled up or down.

*   **C: Letshwao le le lebegang jaaka V:** This refers to the up-bow, which produces a lighter sound, not the stronger sound.

*   **D: Go simologa mo letsogo la gago le tshwereng thapo e e bofilweng:** This is simply how one starts, but does not guarantee the right sound.

"
Marapo a kgale a a bontshang maemo kwa tshimologong go ya ka se se latelang?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: Go tsamaya**.

The passage discusses how hominids evolved to no longer use their arms for locomotion. It contrasts the chimpanzee's arm, which is used for weight-bearing while walking, with the human arm, which is shorter and more adapted for manipulation. The text also mentions fossil evidence showing the shift from using the hand for locomotion to using it for control.
"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e tlhalosang sentle dipente tsa marapo a menwana a chimpanzee? ,"The correct answer is **C: Di dirisiwa go sikara boima**.

Here's why:

*   **P states:** ""Leoto la tshwene ya chimpanzi ratile go lekana le letsogo la yone ka bophara le boleele. Se se supa go re letsogo le dirisiwa gape go jara bokete jwa mmele wa yone fa e tsamaya ka matsogo."" This directly states that chimpanzee hands are used to bear weight.
*   **A: A tlhamaletse go nale a batho:** P states ""Letsogo la motho le lekhutshwane go na le leoto, ka marapo a menwana a a tlhamaletseng le go feta."" This refers to the finger bones of humans.
*   **B: Matsogo le maoto a yone ga a lekane ka bogolo:** This is incorrect. P states ""Leoto la tshwene ya chimpanzi ratile go lekana le letsogo la yone ka bophara le boleele."" which translates to the leg of a chimpanzee is almost equal to its arm in width and length
*   **D: Di dirisediwa sentlentle go tsietsa:** There is no mention of chimpanzee hands being used to trick other things.

Therefore, the best answer is **C**."
Tlhopo e ntsha go sa tshwane ga dijini tse diša go tswa mo go tsefeng tse di leng gone?,"The correct answer is **D: Di bontshitswe**.

The passage states that selection removes variation from the ""displayed"" (or shown) variation pool. ""Bonalang"" in the passage means ""visible"" or ""displayed"".
"
Ke efe ya tsamaiso e e nang le maikarabelo mo go oketseng dijini tse di sa tshwaneng?,"The answer is **C: Go oketsega (Mutation)**.

The passage states: ""Phetogo ya dijini e dira go re go nne le pharologano e ncha ya dijini..."" which translates to ""Gene mutation creates new genetic variation..."". Therefore, mutation (go oketsega) is the process responsible for increasing genetic diversity.
"
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e mo serapeng, ke efe ya tseno e e ka bonalang e ka jega go rarabolola “bothata jwa poreiteine”?","The correct answer is **C: Ditsie**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""dijo tsa diphogologolo (ditshoswane, motlhwa, mae) ga di jege motlhofo fela, mme gape di na le dikotla tse dintsi tse di nang le poroteine e bile di na le di-amino acid tse di botlhokwa"" which translates to ""animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also rich in protein and essential amino acids."" While ditsie (locusts) are not explicitly listed, they fall under the umbrella of ""animal foods/insects"" which are stated to be a good source of protein and easy to digest.

The passage specifically mentions that raw leaves and beans are difficult for humans to digest.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya mathata a a latelang e e sa bakiweng ke go tlhoma diasiti ya amino e e tlhokegang?","The passage states the following consequences of failing to meet amino acid needs:

*   Impaired growth (go tshwenyega thata mo maikutlong ga kgolo)
*   Malnutrition (phepelotlase)
*   Death (loso)

Therefore, options B, C and D, go sa je sentle (malnutrition), kgolo ya kgatelelo ya mogopolo (Impaired growth) and loso (death) are mentioned in the passage as consequences. Only the first one is not a consequence listed in the passage.

So the correct answer is **A: Mathata a mateng a go sila dijo**
"
Maloko a setso se se rileng gantsi a bontsha jang gore a amana le setlhopha?,"The best answer is **D: Ka go dirisa setaele jaaka tsela ya setshwantsho**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions that members of a subculture often show their belonging through specific styles and behaviors, including dress, conduct, and language. These are all forms of self-expression and signaling identity, making style a kind of ""representation"" or ""image"" of their group affiliation.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Ka go batla go amogelwa (By seeking acceptance):** While belonging and acceptance might be a *result* of joining a subculture, the passage focuses more on the *expression* of belonging rather than the *motivation* for seeking it.
*   **B: Ka go dira se bodumedi jwa batho botlhe ba ba ba potileng (By doing what the religion of all the people around them does):** Subcultures are often *different* from the mainstream; following the dominant religion would be counter to the idea of a subculture.
*   **C: Ka go dira ka moo batho ba dirang dilo ka gone (By doing things the way people do them):** This is too general. Subcultures are characterized by doing things *differently* from the norm."
"Go ya ka kgopolo e e leng mo serapeng, go ka direga eng ka ngwana yo o bontshang a tswa mo lotsong lo lo rileng le le nang le mokgwa wa go akanya ka boitshwaro jo bo tshosetsang?","The correct answer is **B: Ngwana go ka direga thata gore a itshware ka tsela e e tshosang**.

**Explanation:**

The passage (P) states that children, even at a young age, can recognize racial and ethnic stereotypes, which can affect their behavior.  Specifically, if children are part of a group believed to perform poorly in school, they are likely to perform poorly once they internalize this belief.

Therefore, if a child is from a racial group associated with threatening behavior, according to the passage, they are more likely to exhibit threatening behavior themselves after becoming aware of that stereotype.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, kitso ya ngwana ka go akanya ka ditsela tse di rileng ka lotso go ka nna le ditlamorago dife tse di latelang?","The correct answer is **B: Boitshwaro (Behavior)**.

The passage states explicitly that children's awareness of racial stereotypes can affect their behavior. The example given is that children who belong to a racial group stereotyped as underperforming in school are more likely to underperform themselves once they become aware of this stereotype.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang e neng e sa tsamaisane le go gola ga ngwana wa phage?","The correct answer is **B: Bokgoni jo bo boteng jwa puo**.

The passage states that feral children often lack social skills and may exhibit behaviors similar to the animals that raised them, such as fear of humans. The passage does not suggest that feral children have a high level of language.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang e tlhalosang sentle mekgwa ya bophage ya bana?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **B: Boitshwaro jwa bophage bo ka bakiwa ke go tlhoka go itsalanya le batho**.

"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya mekgwa e e latelang e sa tsamaelaneng le temo-thuo ya itshetso?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **B: Go dira dijo tse di rekisediwang ba bangwe.**

"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e tlhalosang sentle tsela ya go lema?,"The correct answer is **D: E santse e dirisiwa ke balimi mo dinageng tse dingwe**.

The passage explicitly states ""...mme go sentse go ntse jalo mo dinageng tse dintsi tse di tlhabologang,"" which translates to ""...and it is still practiced in many developing countries.""  This confirms that subsistence farming is still in use.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ke tsamaiso yotlhe ya dijo tse di jetsweng:** While subsistence farming *is* about food production, the statement ""tsamaiso yotlhe ya dijo tse di jetsweng"" is too broad and doesn't capture the specific characteristics of subsistence farming (focus on family needs, simple methods, etc.).

*   **B: E dirisa ditsela tse di sa tlwaelegang go godisa dijalo:** The passage describes subsistence farming as using ""thulaganyo e e botlhofo, e gantsi e leng ya tlhago..."" (a simple, often natural process), not necessarily ""ditsela tse di sa tlwaelegang"" (unusual methods).

*   **C: E letlelela balemi go abelana ka dijalo tsa bone mo kgaolong ya bone:** While sharing *might* happen in some cases, the primary goal of subsistence farming is self-sufficiency for the farmer and their family, not large-scale sharing within a region.

Therefore, only option D accurately reflects information presented in the passage."
Go etela museamo go wela mo karolong efe ya go ja nala?,"The correct answer is **C: Bojanala jwa setso**.

The passage explains that bojanala jwa setso (cultural tourism) involves visiting a place to learn about its history and culture. Visiting a museum clearly falls under this category as museums are dedicated to preserving and showcasing history and culture.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se se ka tlang pele mo baeng ba tsa go iketla?","The correct answer is **B: Go ikhutsa mo ditirong tsa bona letsatsi le letsatsi**

The passage states that leisure tourism involves people traveling to a different environment from their daily lives to relax and rest.
"
Se se builweng mo serapeng jaaka sengwe se se thusitseng go fokotsa go fetola poifo mo teng ga kereke ya selegae?,"The correct answer is **A: Go gopola moo go nnileng le katlego gone mo boitshwarong jwa kgwebo**.

The passage specifically states: ""Mo seemong se, a gakologelwa ditiragalo tsa maitsholo a boiperekei e bile di tlhola katlego e e thusitseng batho go re ba amogele diphetogo le ditaelo tse di ntsha tsa dikereke tsa kgaolo. Dipolelo tse di ntseng jaana tsa katlego di fokoditse letshogo la diphetogo..."" This directly translates to remembering instances of successful behavior (boiperekei - literally ""self-reliance"" but in this context implying proactive behavior/initiatives) that led to success, which helped people accept change.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, go tlhaloganya hisistori ya botho go ka thusa ka eng?","The correct answer is **A: Go fokotsa letshogo la go fetoga (To reduce the fear of change)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...Dipolelo tse di ntseng jaana tsa katlego di fokoditse letshogo la diphetogo, ebile di tsetsekeletso ya go bona diphetogo mo nakong e e seng kgakala."" This translates to ""...Such stories of success have reduced the fear of change, and they nurture the anticipation of seeing changes in the near future.""

The passage emphasizes that understanding the history of success, especially in relation to past experiences and behaviors, helps to alleviate the anxiety associated with new changes and directions.

The other options are not directly supported by the paragraph:

*   **B: Go thatafatsa boleng (To strengthen value)**: While the passage mentions value, it doesn't directly connect understanding personal history to *strengthening* value.
*   **C: Gore o kgone go nna mo mokgatlhong (To be able to live in the society)**: The paragraph focuses on institutional and personal history within that, not societal integration.
*   **D: Go tokafatsa mekgwa ya kgwebo (To improve business practices)**: The passage is about church changes and personal experiences, not directly related to business practices."
Ke efe ya mafoko a a tlhalosang a a latelang a tlhalosang sentle ditsela tsa morago ga gompieno tsa go ithuta?,"The correct answer is **D: Ga gona ditsela tsa botlhokwa mo go ithuteng.**

Here's why:

* **P (Premise):** The passage emphasizes that there's no single ""right"" way to learn and that any experience can be a learning opportunity, even passively watching a TV show.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Maitemogelo a mangwe a go ithuta a tswela mosola go nale a mangwe:** This contradicts the passage, which suggests all experiences can be valuable for learning.
* **B: Go ithuta go tshwanetse go tlhoma mogopolo mo dilong tse re dumelang gore re tlile go itemogela:** This contradicts that thuto e diragala mo maitemogelong gareng ga moithuti le kitso e e teng.
* **C: Ditsela tse dingwe tsa go ithuta di botoka go nale tse dingwe:** This also directly contradicts the passage's central argument that there isn't a superior method.

Therefore, **D** is the only option that aligns with the passage's core idea of learning as a broad and open process without prescribed methods.
"
Ke efe ya mafoko a a tlhalosang a a latelang e bontshang sentle ditsela tsa morago ga gompieno tsa go ithuta?,"The best answer is **C: Maitemogelo a go ithuta a ikaegile ka moithuti le kitso e a e abetsweng.**

Here's why:

* **P highlights the interaction:** The passage emphasizes that learning happens ""mo maitemogelong gareng ga moithuti le kitso e e teng"" (in the experiences between the learner and the existing knowledge). This perfectly aligns with option C, which states that learning experiences depend on the learner and the knowledge presented to them.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as accurate:

* **A: Go nale ditsela tse dintsi tsa go ithuta tshedimosetso:** While the passage mentions that there isn't one ""right"" way to learn, it mainly focuses on the importance of experience and the interaction with knowledge, not just the variety of methods.
* **B: Maitemogelo a mangwe a go ithuta a tshwanetse go beelwa kwa pele go nale a mangwe:** The passage does not indicate some learning experiences are more valuable than others. In fact, it implies that learning something even if you do not apply it is valuable.
* **D: Kitso e re se kitlang re e dirisa le yone go santse go le botlhokwa go e ithuta:** Although the last part of P mentions that much of the information gained is not used practically, this is presented as an example of how learning occurs outside of practical use, rather than a main point."
"Morago ga go tsoga ka bomo ka nako ya gale ya go robala, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e ka amang go tsamaiso ya go kgoreletsa boroko?","The correct answer is **B: Go ya ntlwaneng mme o bo o boela bolaong**.

The passage describes sleep procrastination as waking up deliberately earlier than normal and then going back to sleep soon after. One of the ways mentioned to help with this is drinking lots of liquids so you're forced to get up and pee, thus interrupting your sleep. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.

Here's why the other options are less suitable:
*   **A: Go bala ura le halofo pele ga go boela borokong** - This implies staying awake for 90 minutes, which is not a short nap.
*   **C: Go tima alamo e e gaufi le bolao mme o bo o ya go thulamela metsotso e le masome mabedi morago ga moo** - While this involves turning off the alarm, the passage suggests placing the alarm further away to force you out of bed. The 20-minute nap aligns with the short nap mentioned in the definition of sleep procrastination. However, the action of turning off the alarm doesn't interrupt the sleep process by physically getting up.

*   **D: Go tsogela go nwa metsi go tswa mo botlolong e e gaufi le bolao** - This doesn't necessarily interrupt the sleep process and encourage going to the bathroom."
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e seng tlhaloso e e tshwanetseng ya go kgoreletsega ga boroko?,"Tlhaloso e e seng tshwanetseng ya go kgoreletsega ga boroko ke **D: Morago ga go tsoga, mokgele ke go robala mo diureng tse pedi**.

Go ya ka tlhaloso ya potso, motho o boela go robala mo nakong e khutshwane morago ga go tsoga, e seng diureng tse pedi.
"
"Fa boboko bo ntse bo leka go lora ka tsela e e utlwalang gantsi, ke eng se se oketsegang?","The correct answer is **D: Nako mogare ga maemo a REM**.

The passage states that lucid dreaming ""increases the amount of time between sleep states called REM."" Therefore, if lucid dreaming (and thus more intense dreaming) is happening often, the time *between* REM states increases.
"
Ke dife tsa ditlamorago tse di sa siamang tse di latelang tse go lora o thantse gantsi go ka nnang le tsone mo mmeleng?,"The correct answer is **B: Go fokotsega ga REM bosigo bongwe le bongwe**.

The passage states that lucid dreaming ""oketsa lebaka la nako e e fa gare ga diemo tsa go robala tse di bidiwang REM."" (increases the duration of time between REM sleep cycles).  Because one is not getting enough sleep each night, lucid dreaming can cause REM sleep to decrease each night (Go fokotsega ga REM bosigo bongwe le bongwe).
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ditlhopha tse di tlwaelegileng le tse e seng tsa mmatota di tshwana jang?","The correct answer is **A: Go lebeletswe gore ditlhopha tseno ka bobedi di dire ka selekanyo se se tshwanang**.

The passage states: ""Ditlhopha tse di mo maranyaneng di tshwerwa ka seemo se se ko godimo sa ditsholofelo, fela jaaka ditlhopha tse di tlwaelegileng..."" which translates to ""Virtual teams are held to a high level of expectation, just like traditional teams..."" This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ditlhopha tseno ka bobedi di na le maemo a a farologaneng a go itaola mo ditirong tsa letsatsi le letsatsi:** The passage actually suggests virtual teams have *more* autonomy.
*   **C: Ditlhopha tseno ka bobedi di ikarabelela mo setlhopheng se se sa bonaleng sa batsamaisi:** While the ""invisible team"" is mentioned, the passage doesn't explicitly state that BOTH virtual and traditional teams are accountable to it in the same way. It primarily describes the ""invisible team"" in relation to virtual teams.
*   **D: Ditlhopha tseno ka bobedi di dira mo lefelong le le lengwe la nako:** The passage doesn't state that traditional teams do not work at different times.

Therefore, option A is the only one directly supported by the information given in the passage."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mafoko afe a a malebana le ditlhopha tsa mmatota le tse e seng tsa boammaaruri?","The correct answer is **C: Ditlhopha tse di tlwaelegileng ga di na taolo e e kalo go na le tse e seng tsa boammaruri**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Gantsi ba nale boikemelanosi go gaisa ditlhopha tsa tlwaelo..."" This directly translates to ""They (virtual team members) often have more autonomy than traditional teams..."" Autonomy implies less control from management.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gantsi ditlhopha tse di tlwaelegileng di na le maemo a a kwa godimo:** The passage states that both virtual and traditional teams are held to high expectations, not that traditional teams *generally* have high expectations.
* **B: Ditlhopha tse e seng tsa boammaruri gantsi ke tsone tse di kopanang le ditlhopha tse di tlwaelegileng:** The text mentions that virtual team members might work to connect traditional teams, but not that virtual teams generally meet with tradional teams.
* **D: Dinako tse di farologaneng di ka solegela molemo ditlhopha tse e seng tsa boammaruri:** The paragraph does not suggest that.
"
Ke efe mo go tse di latelang se se sa amaneng le dikgopolo tsa diteng?,"The correct answer is **A: Dikeletso tse disha tse di diragalang fa motho a setse a godile.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that content theories focus on things that are **internal and develop over time** as people grow. This means options C and D, which refer to internal needs and interests, are related to content theories.

*   The passage also mentions that content theories look at how the environment affects actions, so option B is relevant.

*   Option A describes *new* desires that arise *after* someone has grown. This contradicts the idea that content theories are primarily concerned with needs developed over time.
"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e sa akarediweng mo molaong wa boraro?,"The passage states that the rule of thirds aims to create dynamic compositions while maintaining balance. Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Go dira motheo wa gore motho a ka nna a bewa kae (Creating a basis for where a person can be placed):** This aligns with placing the subject at the intersection points of the rule of thirds grid, which is a direct application of the rule.
*   **B: Go bopa botshelo le maatla mo setshwantshong (Creating life and energy in the image):** The passage mentions ""maatlametlo"" (dynamism), which is related to creating energy in the image. So the rule of thirds is applicable here.
*   **C: Go dira gore motho a nne mo lefelong le le rileng le le molemo (Making a person be in a certain good place):** This is related to placing the subject at the intersection points of the rule of thirds grid, which is a direct application of the rule.
*   **D: Go tlhoma thulaganyo mo setshwantshong (Establishing order in the image):** The passage mentions ""tekano e e rileng"" (a certain balance), which implies order. However, the entire passage is all about the layout of a photograph using horizontal and vertical lines.

Therefore, based on the provided passage, **D: Go tlhoma thulaganyo mo setshwantshong** is the option that is least directly implied by the rule of thirds, as described. While the rule of thirds can contribute to order, the other options are more directly related to its practical application.

So, the answer is **D**."
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e sa tlhaloseng popego ya ditshwantsho tsa dimilimitara tse 35?,"The answer is **C: E na le selekanyo se se farologaneng le sa dipopego tse dingwe tse di tlwaelesegileng**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that many other common formats (like APS) are *similar* to the 3:2 aspect ratio of 35mm format. This directly contradicts option C.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: E santse e dirwa:** The passage states, ""E santse e tlhagisiwa le gompieno"" (It is still being produced today).
*   **B: ""E ne ya dirisiwa ke dipopego tsa dikapaditshwantsho tsa maranyane a """"digital"""""":** The passage mentions, ""Sebopego sa 35mm tota tota, se ka tsela nngwe se tlhakanyang tlhogo, ke sa bophara jwa 36mm ka boleele jwa 24mm. Karoganyo ya dikarolwana tsa sebopego seno (e e aroganngwang ka lesome-le-bobedi go fitlhelela karoganyo ya nomore e feletseng) ka gone e bolelwa fa e le 3:2. Dibopego tse di tlwaelegileng di le dintsi (setlhopha sa dibopego tsa APS, ka sekai) di lekana le kana di batla di lekana gaufi thata le karoganyo ya karolwana.""
*   **D: Ke poego e e tlwaelesegileng thata mo lefatsheng:** The passage starts by saying, ""Ka sekai, sebopego se se tlwaelegileng thata sa go tsaya senepe se se emeng mo lefatsheng ke 33mm"" (For example, the most common format for still photography in the world is 33mm).

Therefore, only option C is incorrect and thus the correct answer."
"Go ya ka serapa, fa baetsi ba dilense ba ntse ba tokafatsa boleng jwa dilense tsa bone, dilense tsa go atolosa dilo di tokafetse jang?","The correct answer is **C: Di kgona go tsaya ditshwantsho ka tsela e e tshwanang le ya dilense tse di nang le lobelo lo lo tlhomameng lwa go tlhoma lense**.

Lebaka:

Tlhaloso e e fa godimo e gatelela gore Masaitseweng a farologane le mefuta e mengwe ya bodumedi le kobamelo ka go gatelela maitemogelo a namana a maemo a a kgethegileng a menagano. Option D e bolela se se fapaneng, ke gore, Masaitseweng ga a farologane le mefuta e mengwe ya bodumedi le kobamelo, e leng se se sa dumellaneng le tlhaloso.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e seng karolo ya dithuto tsa Masaitseweng?","The correct answer is **B: Go batla kitso ka go dirisa maitemogelo a a kopanetsweng le a setšhaba**.

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes **direct, personal experience** in seeking divine truth within Mysticism. This contrasts with shared or public experiences. Options A, C, and D are explicitly mentioned or implied as parts of mystical pursuits.
*   The passage mentions ""Balatedi ba sala morago ditsela tse di rileng tsa go tshela, kgotsa ditwaelo tse di ikaeletseng go otla maitemogelo ao,"" meaning that Mysticism includes some traditions, but it focuses on a single experience."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mang yo o ka tswang a simolotse setšhaba sa temothuo?","The passage states: ""Mogopolo o, o ne wa nna le kakanyo ya go re batho ba letso la Maori ba dule go tswa mo Polynesia ba le bantsi ba leba New Zealand ba bo ba mo tsaya mo morafeng wa Moriori, ba simolola tsamaiso ya temo-thuo.""

This suggests that the initial belief was that the **Maori from Polynesia** were the ones who started agriculture in New Zealand after arriving and displacing the Moriori.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Ba-Maori ba ba tswang kwa Polynesia**.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, setlhopha se se neng se tsoma di-moas e ne e le baagi ba ntlha ba lefelo lefe?","The passage states that it was believed the first inhabitants of **New Zealand** hunted moas.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Naga** (which translates to ""Country"" in Setswana).
"
Ke mo seemong sefe se go dirisa mokgwa wa Pureland wa go dira di-origami go ka solegelang yo o menang molemo?,"Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **D: Foldara e e lekile gangwe kgotsa gabedi pele ga foo.**

**Lebaka:**

Pureland origami e diretswe go tlhofofatsa mothale wa go ruta. Ka jalo, e ne e ka thusa motho yo o sa tswang go leka origami kgotsa ba ba kileng ba leka gangwe kgotsa gabedi.

"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e sa tlhalosang sentle origami ya Pureland?,"The correct answer is **A: E diretswe dipampiri tse di mennweng gantsi.**

Here's why:

*   **P states** that Pureland origami **does not allow** for folding paper multiple times at once. Option A says the opposite, making it an incorrect description.
*   **B states** that Pureland origami **does not allow** for complex folds, which is correct based on the passage.
*   **C states** that all folds should be simple, which is correct.
*   **D states** that Pureland origami is **good for folders with limited motor skills**, which aligns with the passage's statement that it was created to simplify learning for beginners and the disabled.

Therefore, option A misrepresents a core principle of Pureland origami."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke lefelo lefe le le sa amaneng le Setso sa Mokgatšha wa Indus?","The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

Here's why:

*   **Harappa:** The passage states that some call the civilization the ""Harappan Civilization"" *after* Harappa, its first excavated site. This indicates a strong connection.

*   **Noka ya Sarasvati:** The passage mentions that some scholars believe the civilization existed on the now-dried Sarasvati Riverbed, suggesting a connection.

*   **Dikarolo tsotlhe tsa bokonebotlhaba jwa Afghanistan:** The passage states that it included a few parts of northeastern Afghanistan

*   **Bontsi jwa Pakistan ya segompieno:** The passage explicitly states it included most of present-day Pakistan.

Therefore, A is the correct answer."
Ke efe ya maina a a latelang e e sa umakiweng e le leina le le ka tswang le dirisitswe go bitsa Bronze Age e go buiwang ka yone mo serapeng?,"The correct answer is **A: Setšhaba sa Ba-Harappan**.

Here's why:

*   **P: Tlhabologo ya Molatswana wa Indus (Setšhaba sa Noka ya Indus):** This is directly mentioned as the primary name.
*   **Setšhaba sa Indus-Sarasvati:** This is mentioned as an alternative name proposed by some scholars.
*   **Tlhabologo ya Harappan (Setšhaba sa Harappan):** This is mentioned as another name, derived from the first excavated site.
*   **Setšhaba sa Mokgatšha wa Indus:** This is the same as ""Tlhabologo ya Molatswana wa Indus"".

Therefore, ""Setšhaba sa Ba-Harappan"" is the one name that is not mentioned as a potential name for the civilization. Although the text does refer to the ""Tlhabologo ya Harappan"", the provided answer option is ""Setšhaba sa Ba-Harappan"" which is incorrect.

So, the answer is A."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e tla re solegelang molemo mo isagweng?","The correct answer is **A: Ba dirisane mmogo le ba bangwe.**

The passage states: ""Gongwe, bontsi jwa batho bo tla lemoga fa go tla ba tswela mosola fa nako e ntse e ya go re ba dirisane mmogo le ba bangwe."" (Perhaps, most people will realize that it will benefit them in the long run to cooperate with others.) This directly supports option A.
"
"Go ya ka temana e, ke eng se motho a ka se bayang kwa pele fa a batla maduo a a bogadi bo gaufi?","The correct answer is **D: Bogagapa**.

The passage states that ""Lefufa le bogagapa di tla tlhola di na le rona ebile ke mokgwa wa go dirisana go re fa bontsi bo bona dipoelo go tla hola go na le mo go gontsi go gatjwa mo nakong e khutshwane ka tsela ya bo gagapa."" This clearly indicates that greed (bogagapa) is the way to quickly get results.

"
Ke nako efe e e neng ya tla pele ga motlha wa Ba-Templar?,"The passage states that the Templars emerged during the ""High Middle Ages"" (AD 1000-1300). It also says that the High Middle Ages were *followed* by the Late Middle Ages and *preceded* by the Early Middle Ages.

Therefore, the time period *before* the Templars' emergence was the **C: Tshimologo ya Metlha ya Bogare (Early Middle Ages)**.
"
Ke nako efe e e neng ya latela motlha wa Ba-Templar?,"The passage states that the ""High Middle Ages"" (AD 1000-1300) were followed by ""the late Middle Ages"" and that the Middle Ages ended around 1500. Thus, the correct answer is **A: Bofelo jwa Metlha ya Bogare (Bofelo jwa Metlha ya Bogare)**.
"
Ke kalafi efe kgotsa karo e go sa umakiweng gore e ne e dirisiwa ke dingaka le dingaka tse di arang mo motlheng wa Mmusomogolo wa Roma?,"The correct answer is **A: Go alafa bolwetse jwa go ngomoga pelo morago ga tiragalo e e utlwisang botlhoko ka diritibatsi tse di farologaneng tse di robatsang**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions the use of morphine and scopolamine, but it doesn't say they were used for treating PTSD. It only says they were used in general.
*   The passage directly mentions scopolamine being derived from plant extracts.
*   The passage specifically mentions using clamps to stop bleeding.
*   The passage directly mentions amputation for gangrene."
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e sa amaneng le kgatelopele e e neng ya dirwa mo go tsa kalafi ka nako ya Mmusomogolo wa Roma?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **C: Go tlhomiwa ga dikokelo tsa go ithutela bongaka**.

Bokgoni jwa go bona bo ikaegile ka eng?,"Based on the provided text (P), the correct answer is:

**A: Dikarolo tsa mmele tse di dirang gore motho a bone**

The passage explicitly states that vision ""ikaegile ka dikarolo tsa mmele tse di thusang go bona kgotsa matlho"" which translates to ""depends on the parts of the body that help to see or the eyes"".
"
Go farologana ga popego ya leitlho ga ditshedi go ikaegile ka eng?,"The best answer is **B: Ditlhokego tsa setshedi (The needs of the organism)**.

Here's why:

*   **P focuses on diversity.** P states that different organisms have different types of eyes based on their needs, capabilities and method of data reception.

The other options are not directly mentioned in the text as the main reason for the variation in eye structure across species."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mafoko afe a a malebana le Sikh a a sa tlhalosang bodumedi jono sentle?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **A: Bo-Sikh bo simologile ka go kgaogana ga makoko mo dingwaong tsa Bahindu**.

"
"Go ya ka temana eno, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e tsewang e le karolo ya konokono ya tumelo ya Sikh?","The correct answer is **A: Kgopolo ya gore go na le moruti**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Borutisi jwa sedumedi ke karolo ya botlhokwa thata mo ditumelong tsotlhe tsa Se-India mme go ya ka bo-Sikhik bo tsere karolo ya botlhokwa e e bopang dithuto tsa bodumedi tsa konokono tsa ma-Sikh."" This directly supports the idea of the Guru (moruti) being central to Sikhism.
*   The passage also mentions ""Ba-Sikh ba bitsa tumelo ya bone ba re ke Gurmat, e leng """"tsela ya morutisi wa sedumedi"""" ka se-Punjab"".
The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dingwao tsa Sehindu**: While Sikhism has roots in Hinduism, the passage mentions that Sikhs consider their religion distinct.
*   **C: Go gana go amogela madumedi a mangwe a Ma-India**: The passage doesn't indicate a rejection of other Indian religions.
*   **D: Go bua Se-Punjabi**: While the term Gurmat is defined in Punjabi, the passage does not indicate that speaking Punjabi is a core part of the Sikh faith."
"Go ya ka serapa, bana ba ba sa kgoneng go tlhoma mogopolo ba ka nna ba thatafalelwa ke go tlhoma mogopolo mo go eng?","The correct answer is **A: Tiro ya sekolo**.

The passage states: ""Bana ba ba nang le bolwetse jwa ADD ba na le bothata jwa go dira tiro ya sekolo..."" This directly supports option A.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke ka ntlha yang fa bana ba ba sa kgoneng go tlhoma mogopolo ba rata go dira dilo tse di kotsi?","The correct answer is **D: Go tlhotlheletsa boboko jwa bone**.

The passage states: ""Bana ba ba tshabelelwa kego tsena mo mathateng ka gore ba ”inaakanya le ditiro tsedi borai jaaka, go lwantshana le batho lego lwantshana le bogogi”, gore ba tsose boboko ka gore maboko a bone ga a tsosiwe ke dilo tsa tlwaelesego."" This directly explains that children with ADD engage in risky behavior to stimulate their brains because ordinary activities don't provide enough stimulation.
"
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e mo serapeng, ke efe mo go tseno e e seng sekai sa go thusa ngwana go ithuta?","The answer is **C: Thulaganyo e e ikemetseng ya go ithuta**. Here's why:

*   **Scaffolding** as described in the passage involves providing support to learners who are tackling new or challenging tasks. This support can come in the form of tools, real people (like teachers), or virtual aids.
*   Options A, B, and D all describe situations where someone is providing direct support to the learner during a learning process:
    *   A: Starting a computer game might require initial guidance or tutorials (scaffolding).
    *   B: An SAT tutor provides direct instruction and support.
    *   D: A small group tutor provides direct instruction and support.
*   Option C, a ""thulaganyo e e ikemetseng ya go ithuta"" (independent learning program), implies that the learner is working alone without immediate help or guidance from a scaffolding tool as desribed in the passage. There is no immediate access to assistance when the student is struggling. Therefore, it doesn't fit the definition of scaffolding as described in the passage."
"""Ke mafoko afe mo go a a latelang a a sa tlhaloseng sentle kgopolo ya """"scaffold"""" (go thusa ngwana go ithuta)?""","The correct answer is **C: Gape go itsege jaaka go ithuta go go ikaegileng ka porojeke.**

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly contrasts scaffolding with project-based learning.** It states that while project-based learning makes learning easier and engaging, scaffolding does something *more* than that. Scaffolding is presented as a tool to aid in learning, not as a synonym for a specific learning approach like project-based learning.
*   The other options (A, B, and D) align with the description of scaffolding in the passage:

    *   A: real scaffolds
    *   B: Scaffolds as a method of teaching
    *   D: Scaffolds are used at the start of learning new things"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke karolo efe ya MySpace e e ka thusang baithuti ba ba nang le bothata jwa go bala?","The correct answer is **A: Thulaganyo e e diretsweng wena**.

Here's why:

*   The paragraph states that the website ""can be modified to make it easier to read as well as with as much or as little of the desired color as possible."" This directly refers to the ability to customize the website's appearance to suit individual reading needs, making ""Thulaganyo e e diretsweng wena"" the most relevant answer.
*   ""Aterese e le nngwe ya Inthanete"" helps baithuti ba ba nang le bothata le go dirisa khiiboto kgotsa le mopeleto ba tlanye, ga se baithuti ba ba nang le bothata jwa go bala."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e neng e se karolo ya karabo ya ga Khrushchev mo dikhuduegong tsa badiri?","The correct answer is **C: Go fokotsa dituelo**.

The passage states that the workers were protesting against *go fokodiwa ga dituelo* (reduction of wages). Khrushchev addressed this by agreeing to some of their economic demands and appointing a new Prime Minister. He did not reduce the wages further; instead, he likely addressed the reduction that had already occurred. The passage also mentions sending soldiers to restore order and agreeing to some economic demands.
"
Ke efe mo go tse di latelang e e neng e sa bake dikhuduego kwa Poland?,"The correct answer is **D: Go tlhomiwa ga Wladyslaw Gomulka**.

The passage states that Gomulka's appointment was a *consequence* of the unrest, not a cause. The passage clearly states the causes were ""go tlhaela ga dijo (shortage of food)"" and ""go fokodiwa ga dituelo (wage cuts)"" which led to protests against ""mmuso wa Bokomonisi (Communist regime).""
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e neng e sa ame dikamano tsa USSR le USA?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **B: Dikgopolo ka Jeremane**.

"
Ke eng se se ka fitlhelwang kwa Giza Plateau?,"The correct answers are A, B, and D.

Here's why:

*   **A: Mabitla (Tombs)** - The passage states: ""Setlhaba sa Giza...se na le...mabitla a mannye a le mmalwa...""
*   **B: Ditempele (Temples)** - The passage states: ""Setlhaba sa Giza...se na le...ditempele di le mmalwa...""
*   **D: Phiramiti e Kgolo (The Great Pyramid)** - The passage is primarily about the Great Pyramid at Giza and its significance.

**Why C is incorrect:**
*   **C: Dikgakgamatso Tsotlhe Tse Supa (All Seven Wonders)** - Only the Great Pyramid of Giza, of the original Seven Wonders, is still standing. The passage also mentions there are several Pyramids at the location, not all 7 wonders.

**Therefore, the best answer is A, B, and D.**
"
Boikaelelo jwa Phiramiti e Kgolo e ne e le bofe?,"The correct answer is **B: Go tlotla Faro**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Phiramiti e kgolo e ne e agetswe go tlotla Faro Khufu...""
"
Ke mang yo o ikarabelelang ka go bo re itse motho yo o neng a fisa tempele?,"The correct answer is **C: Strabo**.

The passage states that the Ephesians forbade the writing of Herostratus' name in records. However, the Greek historian Strabo later wrote down the name, which is why we know it today.
"
Ke polelo efe e e boammaaruri malebana le go agiwa seša ga tempele ya ga Aretemise?,"The correct answer is **B: E ne ya agiwa sesha morago ga puso ya ga Alexander yo Mogolo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Moragonyana, ga gore Alexander a tlhokafale, tempele e ile ya agiwa sesha kwa ngwaga ya 323 BCE."" This directly translates to ""After Alexander died, the temple was rebuilt in the year 323 BCE"", making option B true.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go agiwa seša ga yone go ne ga duelelwa ke Alexander yo Mogolo** - The passage states Alexander offered to pay, but his offer was rejected.
*   **C: Herostratus o ne a laelwa gore a duelele ditshenyegelo tsa go aga sesha** - The passage does not mention that Herostratus was ordered to pay for the rebuilding costs.
*   **D: E ne ya agiwa seša ka 320 B.C.E.** - The passage indicates the Temple was rebuilt in 323 BCE, so this answer is incorrect."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke leng mofuta mongwe wa ditshedi o neng wa simolola go tsamaya ka maoto a mabedi?","The correct answer is **A: Dingwaga di le dimilione di le supa tse di fetileng**.

The passage states: ""mme le gale gongwe di-Sahelanthropus, tsone di ka tswa di ne di tsamaya ka maoto a mabedi mo e ka nang a dingwaga tse di dimilione tse supa tse di fitileng."" This indicates that Sahelanthropus might have walked on two legs around seven million years ago, making it the earliest possible instance mentioned in the passage.
"
Ke mofuta ofe wa ditshedi tseno o ka metlha o neng o tsamaya ka maoto a mabedi?,"The correct answer is **B: Homo erectus**.

The passage states that Homo erectus was the first to walk upright consistently. While other species may have had the *ability* to walk upright, they didn't do so as their primary mode of locomotion.
"
Ke eng se sesole sa lewatle sa Jeremane se neng se leka go se fitlhelela ka nako ya Ntwa ya Lefatshe ya WWII?,"The correct answer is **B: Go thibela Borithane go amogela batho le dithoto**.

The passage states that ""sesole sa lewatle sa Jeremane...se ne se leka go emisa metsamao e"" (the movement of people and supplies from America to Britain). This directly translates to preventing Britain from receiving people and goods.
"
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e mo serapeng, ke mang yo o neng a atlega thata mo ntweng ya sesole sa lewatle ka nako ya Letsholo la Bokone jwa Atlantic?","The correct answer is **A: Maesemane le Maamerika**.

The passage states: ""Fa nkabo segopana ”Allies” se na sa retelelwa..."". This implies the Allies (in this case, the Americans helping Britain) *succeeded* in the Battle of the North Atlantic. Therefore, the British and Americans were ultimately more successful."
Ke eng se se neng se seyo fa Maaasiria ba ne ba simolola go dirisa bapalami ba dipitse?,"Karabo e nepagetseng ke **A: Ditlhagwana**.

Temana e bolela gore ""Setulo se se mo morago ga pitse se ne ise se diriwe, jaanong maAssyrian bane ba lwanela mo mokwatleng wa pitse yo o senag sepe."" Se se supa gore ditlhagwana di ne di seyo.
"
Dintwa tse go dirisiwang kalvari mo go tsone di lowa jang?,"The correct answer is **C: Go palama pitse**.

The passage describes calvary as soldiers fighting on horseback. So the way these wars are fought is by riding horses.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke kae koo o neng o ka se ka wa fitlhela moagi yo o tlwaelegileng wa Babelona gone?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **D: Go tlisetsa ditlhabelo kwa lefelong le le boitshepho la mo teng**.

Serapa se bolela gore batho ba ne ba isa ditlhabelo ko medimong (ka kakaretso), mme ke baruti fela ba neng ba letleletswe go tsena mo phaphusing e e boitshepho e e ka fa teng. Ka jalo, moagi yo o tlwaelegileng wa Babelona a ka bo a sa fitlhelwe a tlisetsa ditlhabelo gone kwa lefelong leo le le boitshepho.
"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang tse di neng di diretswe baperesiti ka tlhamalalo?,"The correct answer is **B: Mafelo a a boitshepho a mo teng**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that only priests were allowed to enter the inner sanctum of the temple (phaphusi e e boitshepho e e ka fa teng).
*   The passage states that priests tried to supply the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals

The other options are not correct because:
*   A: Ceremonies and festivals were used to supply the gods needs
*   C: Ceremonies and festivals were used to supply the gods needs
*   D: Ziggurats were part of temples, but the passage does not say that they were used for priests."
Kgosi Tutankhamun o ne a tuma leng?,"The correct answer is **C: Morago ga go utololwa ga lebitla la gagwe** (After the discovery of his tomb).

The passage states: ""Le fa go ntse jalo, go utololwa ga lebitla la gagwe ka ngwaga wa 1922 go mo dirile go re e nne motho yo o itsegeng thata"" (However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a very well-known figure).
"
Ke eng se se neng sa dira gore Kgosi Tutankhamun e nne kgosi e e itsegeng thata ya Egepeto?,"The correct answer is **A: Go ribololwa ga lebitla la gagwe**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Le fa go ntse jalo, go utololwa ga lebitla la gagwe ka ngwaga wa 1922 go mo dirile go re e nne motho yo o itsegeng thata."" (However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a very well-known person.)
"
Mmoki wa Mogerika e bong Homer o ne a sa kgone go dira eng?,"The passage states that Homer was a ""sefofu,"" which means blind. Therefore, the answer is:

*   **B: Bona** (See)"
Ke Mogerika ofe yo o tumileng yo o itsegeng ka sengwe kwa ntle ga  dibuka?,"The correct answer is **C: Pythagoras**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions that Pythagoras is known for his mathematical theorem (dealing with the sides of triangles), not for books.
*   Homer, Sophocles, and Aristophanes are mentioned as authors or playwrights."
Lelapa la Bahebera le ne le fetsa nako e ntsi ya lone kae?,"The passage explicitly states: ""Bontsi jwa botshelo jwa malapa a ma-Hebero bo ne bo le kwa ntle.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Kwa ntle**
"
Ke eng se se neng se se botlhokwa thata mo lelapeng la Bahebera?,"The correct answer is **A: Tlelaemete ya bone**.

The passage states that in the warm climate of the Middle East, a house was not so important because most of Hebrew family life was outdoors. This directly implies that the climate itself was more important, as it dictated how they lived and used their time.
"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e sa tlhalosiweng e le pharologano fa gare ga dinaga tsa Scandinavia?,"The correct answer is **B: Lefatshe**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions differences in **batho (people)**, **dikgosi (kings)**, **mekgwa (customs)**, and **ditiragalo tsa bogologolo (historical events)**. Since ""ditiragalo tsa bogologolo"" translates to historical events it would be fair to say that this covers A: Hisitori (History)
*   ""Mekgwa"" refers to ""customs"", which covers C: Ditheo tsa setso (Cultural institutions).

Therefore, the only option not explicitly mentioned as a difference is **B: Lefatshe (Land/Geography)**. Although implied it is not explicitly mentioned.
"
Ke mang yo o neng a nna kwa Greenland pele?,"The correct answer is **A: Merafe ya Maeskimo**.

The passage states that ""go sa kgathelesege go re o fitlheletse eng, merafe ya ma-Eskimo e ne e setse e tshela mo lefelong leo,"" which means the Eskimo people were already living in Greenland when Erik the Red arrived.
"
Ke setlhopha sefe se se ka ratang go ja dijo tsa maitseboa se sena ditulo?,"The passage states: ""fa batho ba ba dikobo di dikhutshwane le basadi ba ja dijo ba ntse mo ditilong, bahumi ba ne ba rata go ja dijo tse di farologaneng mmogo mo ba neng ba sekama ka letlhakore fa ba ntse ba ja dijo tsa bone."" This means the wealthy (bahumi) reclined while eating. ""Batho ba ba dikobo di dikhutshwane"" likely refers to men, as women are mentioned separately and would presumably not wear short robes. Therefore, wealthy men reclined while eating, and the other groups sat.

The correct answer is C: Banna ba ba humileng ba kwa Roma
"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e neng e se karolo ya moletlo wa Baroma ba Bogologolo?,"The correct answer is **D: Sejana sa kalakuni e e besitsweng**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that ""ga gona Baroma bape ba bogologolo ba ba kileng ba utlwa monate wa kalakungwa."" (no ancient Romans ever tasted turkey).
*   The passage mentions that poorer people and women ate sitting, while the wealthy reclined.
*   The passage mentions dormice (kgopa) as food eaten during feasts.
*   The passage mentions phikoko as food eaten during feasts."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e ka se kang ya nna le diphelelo tse di nnelang ruri?","The correct answer is **B: Setso se sennye**.

The paragraph states: ""Dingwao tse di nyennyane gantsi di nyelela di sa tlogele sepe kwa morago, se se dira gore di seka tsa tsewa jaaka merafe e e feletseng."" This directly implies that smaller cultures are less likely to have lasting impact. The other options are associated with the concept of 'Tlhabologo', which the passage presents as an enduring and widespread phenomenon.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se se tlang pele ga setšhaba?","The correct answer is **C: Toropo kgolo e gape e leng lefatshe ka bo yone.**

The passage states: ""Metsemegolo e tsile pele ga dichaba."" This translates to ""Cities came before nations."" Option C best reflects this statement.
"
Ke polelo efe e e seng boammaaruri ka Drukgyal Dzong?,"Karabo e e seng boammaaruri ke:

**A: O ne a tlhama kago ya phemelo go keteka phenyo ya masole a Ba-Tibetan le Ba-Mongol**

Polelo e e nepagetseng e re Zhabdrug Ngawang Namgyel o ne a tlhama kago ya phemelo go keteka phenyo ya gagwe *kgatlhanong* le masole a Tibetan-Mongol, e seng go keteka phenyo ya bone.
"
Ke polelo efe e e tlhalosang sentle se se neng sa direga morago ga molelo kwa Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **C: Go tuma ga lefelo leno ga go a amega.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...kago eno ya phemelo e ne ya baakanngwa le go sirelediwa, mme ya nna yone fela e e setseng ya mafelo a a ngokang kgatlhego a kwa Bhutan."" This directly implies that despite the fire and damage, Drukgyal Dzong remained a popular attraction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Selo se le sengwe fela se se neng se setse e ne e le setshwantsho sa ga Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal:** The passage says the *remains* included images of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, not that the images were the *only* thing remaining.
* **B: Masole a Ba-Tibetan le Ba-Mongol a ne a fenya:** The passage states the Dzong was built to *celebrate* a victory *against* Tibetan-Mongol forces.
* **D: E ne ya bolokwa ke Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel:** Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built it originally; he did not save it after the fire, as the fire happened long after his time. Furthermore, the passage states the fortress was restored and secured after the fire.

Therefore, only option C accurately reflects what happened after the fire as described in the passage.
"
Ke mafoko afe a a latelang a a boammaaruri ka Cambodia?,"The correct answer is **D: Ba-Thai ba ne ba senya Phnom Phen**.

The passage states: ""Ba-Thai ba ne ba tlhasela Cambodia makgetlho a le mmalwa mo lekgolong la bo-18 la dingwaga mme ka 1772 ba ne ba senya Phnom Phen.""
"
"Ke efe ya dipolelo tse di latelang, e e tlhalosang sentle go tlhaselwa ga Cambodia?","The best answer is **D: Ba-Thai ba ne ba tlhasela Cambodia makgetlho a le mmalwa**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Ba-Vietnam ba ne ba tlhasela Cambodia makgetlho a le mmalwa** The paragraph states that they attacked at the *end* of the 1700s, not multiple times.

*   **B: Ba-Thai le Ba-Vietnam ba ne ba tlhasela Cambodia ka 1772** The paragraph states that the Thai attacked Cambodia in 1772 and destroyed Phnom Phen. It does not state that the Vietnamese attacked in 1772.

*   **C: Ba-Vietnam ba ne ba senya Phnom Phen** The paragraph states that the Thai destroyed Phnom Phen, not the Vietnamese.

*   **D: Ba-Thai ba ne ba tlhasela Cambodia makgetlho a le mmalwa** This statement is directly supported by the first sentence in the paragraph: ""Ba-Thai ba ne ba tlhasela Cambodia makgetlho a le mmalwa mo lekgolong la bo-18 la dingwaga.""

Therefore, the best answer is **D**."
Ke efe yakhamphani tsa Ma-Dutch a ko Botlhaba jwa India e ne ya se ka ya dira eng fa e ne e le kwa Taiwan?,"The correct answer is **A: Nna le lefelo kwa karolong e e kwa borwabophirima jwa setlhaketlhake.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states the Dutch East India Company established a base in **southwest** Taiwan. Option A states **southwest**.
*   The passage mentions changes to the cultivation of local grains (B), Chinese laborers (C).
*   Japan controlled Taiwan until 1945. (D) isn't something the Dutch company did.
"
Tumalano ya Shimonoseki e ne ya tlhomamisa eng?,"The correct answer is **D: Taolo ya Japane mo Taiwan**.

The passage states: ""Ka ngwaga wa 1895, ba fetsa go fengwa mo ntweng ya Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), goromete wa Qing o ne wa saenela Treaty of Shimonoseki, e e neng e fa Japan taolo ya kgaolo ya Taiwan."" This directly indicates that the Treaty of Shimonoseki ceded Taiwan to Japan.
"

Tlhaloso: Se se theilwe ka kotloloho mo polelong e: ""Selekanyo sa pH se bontshiwa ke selekanyo sa diayone tsa Hydrogen (H mo go pH) mo khemikaleng e go dirilweng diteko mo go yone."""
Go ne ga ntshiwa eng mo di-ioneng tsa haeterojene?,"The correct answer is **D: Di-eleketerone**.

The passage states: ""Diayone tsa Hydrogen ke di-proton tse di kgaogantsweng le di-electron tsa tsone."" This means electrons were removed from the hydrogen ions.
"
Ke mafoko afe mo go a a latelang a a sa tlhalosang setlhopha sa ditau sentle?,"The correct answer is **D: Di a bolaya e bile di dirisana le batho.**

Here's why:

*   The passage says lions are dangerous to *other animals*, not humans. The passage does not mention anything about lions interacting or cooperating with humans.
*   A: The passage does say that the pride of lions behaves like a pack of wolves or wild dogs.
*   B: The passage mentions that there are 1-3 males and up to 30 females in the pride, which means that the number of males and females are imbalanced.
*   C: The passage mentions that females in the pride are often related, making them a large family of aunts and daughters."
Ke dipolelo dife mo go tse di latelang tse di sa tlhalosang sentle tsela e ditau di itshwarang ka yone?,"Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **A le D**.

Di A le D ke tsona dipolelo tse di sa tlhaloseng sentle tsela e ditau di itshwarang ka yone go ya ka setlhangwa."
Ke mofuta ofe wa sebatana se gantsi se bolayang mebutla?,"The correct answer is **C: Dikatse tse di bogareng**.

The passage states: ""Mo go tsone go na le dikatse tsa bogolo jo bo mo magareng tse di jang diphologolo tsa bogolo jo bo magareng tse di jaaka mebutla, diphoti le diphuduhutswana."" This directly translates to: ""Among them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized animals such as rabbits, squirrels, and lizards.""
"
Dikatse tse dinnye gantsi di tsoma eng mo go tse di latelang?,"The correct answer is **A: Ditshenekegi**.

The passage states that small cats eat ""ditshedinyana tse dinnye tse dintsi tse di jaaka ditshenekegi, dipeba, mekgatitswane, le dinonyane"" which translates to ""many small creatures such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds"".
"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e seng karolo ya mokgwa wa go tsoma wa ocelot?,"The correct answer is **D: Di tsoma fela diphologolo tse dinnye**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Di iphitlha mo tikologong tsa tsone** - The passage states ""Di-ocelot di tsoma ka go iphitlha mo lefelong..."". This is part of their hunting method.
*   **B: Di latela monko wa se ba se tsomang** - The passage states ""Baitsesaense ba akanya go re dikatse tsa nageng di latela le go bona diphologolo tse di ka di jang (se di se tsomang) ka go latela monko wa tsone..."". This is part of their hunting method.
*   **C: Di sala diphologolo tsa bone morago bosigo** - The passage states ""Di kgona go bona fela sentle mo lefifing e bile di tsamaya gape ka tidimalo."". Which suggests they hunt at night, making this part of their hunting behaviour.
*   **D: Di tsoma fela diphologolo tse dinnye** - The passage states ""P: Phologolo e e bidiwang ocelot e rata go ja diphologolo tse di nnye"" and that ""Bontsi ja di phologolo tse di tsongwang ke ocelot di nnye mo go yone"" making this incorrect. While ocelots primarily hunt small animals, this option implies they *only* hunt small animals, which isn't strictly stated. The passage indicates they *prefer* or mostly hunt smaller animals, but doesn't exclude the possibility of them hunting larger prey in rare instances."
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e sa tlhaloseng sentle gore sebatana sa lengau le go tweng ocelot ke eng? ,"The correct answer is **C: Go dupa ga tsone go bokoa**.

The passage states that scientists believe ocelots track prey by scent, implying they have a good sense of smell, not a weak one. The other options are directly supported by the text.
"

"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se se dirang gore go nne le pharologanyo fa gare ga ditau le dipitse?","The correct answer is **B: Modumo wa go kurutla ga tsone**.

The passage states: ""Go rora ga nkwe ga go tshwane le go rora ga lentswe lotlhe ga tau..."" which directly indicates a difference in their roaring sounds.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, Robert Hooke o ne a dira eng pele ga baithutatshelo ba bangwe?","The correct answer is **A: Ela tlhoko disele tse di suleng**.

The paragraph states: ""E ne e le motho wa ntlha go lekola disele tse di suleng."" which translates to ""He was the first person to observe dead cells.""
"
"""Lefoko """"sele"""" le tswa kae?""","The correct answer is **B: Phaposi e nnye**.

The passage states: ""Lefoko sele le tswa mo lefokong la Selatine la """"cella"""" le le kayang phaposi e nnye."" (The word cell comes from the Latin word ""cella"" which means small room.)
"
"Go ya ka serapa, bontsi jwa diphologolo di kgona go dira eng?","The correct answer is **B: Tsamaya**

The paragraph states: ""Bontsi jwa diphologolo di kgona go tsamaya."" which translates to ""Most animals can walk.""
"
"Go ya ka serapa, diphologolo dingwe ga di na eng?","The correct answer is **C: Boboko**.

The passage states: ""Diphologolo ke tsone fela tse di nang le boboko (le fa tota e se diphologolo tsotlhe; ka sekai, jellyfish, yone ga e na boboko)."" This clearly indicates that some animals do not have brains.
"
Ke dimela dife tse di thusang mo thulaganyong ya fotosentesese?,"The correct answer is **D: Letsatsi**.

The passage states that plants make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. The other options are things that plants provide, or things that depend on plants, but the sun is the crucial ingredient for photosynthesis.
"
Ke eng se batho ba se hemang se dimela di se hemang?,"The correct answer is **B: Okosejene** (Oxygen).

The passage states that plants release oxygen for humans to breathe in.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke sekai sefe mo go tse di latelang se se ka kgoreletsang thulaganyo ya go iphetogela ga ditshedi ka botsone go nna tse dingwe?","The correct answer is **A: Setlhopha se sennye se se palelwang ke go atlega mo lefelong le lentshwa.**

Here's why:

* **Speciation requires adaptation:** The passage explains that speciation happens when a small group of organisms adapts to a new environment. If the small group *fails* to thrive (palelwa ke go atlega) in the new environment, they will likely die out, preventing the speciation process from even beginning.
* **The other options describe steps *in* the speciation process:**
    * **B:** Karolo ya batho e e fudugelang kwa lefelong le leša (A population moving to a new location) is the *starting point* for potential speciation.
    * **C:** Palo ya batho e e tlwaelang tikologo e ntšha (A population adapting to a new environment) is a *key step* in the speciation process.
    * **D:** Kgabagare batho ba nna babedi (Eventually, there are two groups) describes the *end result* of successful speciation.
"
Ke dipolelo dife mo go tse di latelang e e sa tlhaloseng sentle gore ditshedi di iphetogela go nna tse dingwe? ,"Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **A: Go direga fa setlhopha se sesha sa batho se sa kgone go fetoga**.

Ke karolo efe ya thulaganyo ya madi e e isang madi kwa pelong?,"The correct answer is **D: Ditshika**.

The passage states: ""Madi a tswa mo pelong ka ditshika tse di bidiwang diatheri a bo a boela mo pelong ka dipeipe tse di bidiwang **diveini**."" Diveini is translated to veins.
"
Ke ditšhupu dife tse dinnye mo thulaganyong ya madi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ditshikana**.

The passage states ""Dipeipi tse dinnye di bidiwa ditshikana."" which translates to ""The small pipes are called capillaries.""
"
Bokgoni jwa tshenekegi jwa go mena diphuka tsa yone bo oketsa eng mo go tse di latelang?,"The correct answer is **B: Mafelonyana a le mantsi a di ka tshabelang dibatana mo go one.**

The passage states that the ability to fold wings allows insects to fit into smaller spaces, which helps them avoid predators.
"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e sa umakiweng mo serapeng e le sengwe se se amang bokgoni jwa tshenekegi jwa go fofa?,"The correct answer is **B: Botshelo jotlhe (Lifespan)**.

The paragraph mentions:

*   **Go tsala (Reproduction)**: ""bokgoni ba go fofa bo di thusitse go tila dira bonolo le gore go kgonege go batla dijo le letsalo"".
*   **Go kokoanya dijo (Gathering food)**: ""bokgoni ba go fofa bo di thusitse go tila dira bonolo le gore go kgonege go batla dijo le letsalo"".
*   **Go lekana (Size/Fit)**: ""Seno se raya go re di na le mafelonyana a le mantsi a di ka tshabelang dibatana mo go one"". (The ability to fold wings allows them to fit into small spaces.)

Lifespan is not mentioned as being directly affected by the insect's ability to fly.
"
Ke mokgwa ofe mo go e e latelang e gantsi e sa amaneng le di-dinosaur?,"The correct answer is **B: Diphofa (Wings)**

Here's why:

*   **A: Go tsamaya ka leoto le le kwa morago (Walking on two hind legs):** Many dinosaurs, especially theropods like the T-Rex, walked on two legs. Birds also walk on two legs.
*   **C: Go beela mae (Laying eggs):** Dinosaurs laid eggs. Birds also lay eggs.
*   **D: Maoto a a nang le manala (Feet with claws):** Dinosaurs had claws on their feet. Birds have claws on their feet.
*   **B: Diphofa (Wings):** While some small dinosaurs may have had feathered arms, **fully formed wings for flight are the distinguishing characteristic of birds**. Most dinosaurs did not have wings or fly."
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e gantsi e sa tseweng e tshwana le dinonyane le di-dinosaur?,"The correct answer is **C: Go kgona go fofa**.

The passage states that many people don't believe birds are dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly. This implies that the ability to fly is a key difference in most people's minds between birds and dinosaurs. The other characteristics (laying eggs, walking on two legs, having clawed feet) are mentioned as similarities.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke karolo efe ya semela sa cycad e Di-Triceratop e ka nnang ya e ja?","The correct answer is **B: Kutu**.

The passage states: ""Triceratops e ka tswa a ne e dirisa molomo wa yone o o thata go tlhobola mathare mo sethareng pele e ja thito."" This directly indicates that Triceratops may have eaten the *thito*, which translates to the *trunk* or *stem*.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng mo go tse di latelang se Di-Triceratop e ka se jang? ","The correct answer is **B: Semela se se nang le dikala tse di thata**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Triceratops **could** eat tough leaves and stems (kegona go sila matlhare ga mmogo le dikgala tse di thata). The question asks what they *could* eat. The paragraph is theorizing about the diet of the Triceratops.
*   The passage mentions that cycads may be poisonous. However, it also mentions that today other animals and birds (descendants of dinosaurs) are able to eat poisonous plants, implying that perhaps the Triceratops was also able to eat them.
*   A and C are not mentioned in the passage at all.

"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mofuta efe ya metshameko e e latelang e e ka tswang o ratiwa thata kwa dikgaolong tse di kwa bokone jwa Italy?","The correct answer is **C: Go palama snowboard**.

The passage states that ""Metshameko ya mariga e tumile thata mo dikgaolong tsa Bokone..."" and snowboarding is a winter sport.
"
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e mo serapeng eno, ke mofuta ofe wa metshameko e e latelang o o neng wa dira gore Italy e nne mmampodi wa lefatshe?","The correct answer is **A: Kgwele ya Dinao**.

The paragraph states that the Italian national football team won the FIFA World Cup in 2006. This confirms that football is the sport that made Italy world champion.
"
Ke tiragalo efe e e neng ya dira gore dikarolo dingwe tsa Luxembourg e nne tsa Belgium?,"The correct answer is **B: Diphetogo Tsa Kwa Belgium**.

The passage states that ""Dikarolo tsa segompieno tsa Belgium e ne e le karolo ya Luxembourg mo nakong e e fetileng mme ya nna karolo ya Belgium morago ga Phetogo ya kwa Belgium ya bo-1830.""
"
Ke maemo afe a a latelang a a neng a ama boitlhaodi jwa Luxembourg?,"The correct answers are **A: Go nniwa ke Jeremane** and **C: Diphetogo Tsa Kwa Belgium**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Go nniwa ke Jeremane** - The text states that Luxembourg was occupied by Germany during both World War I and World War II. This occupation directly affected its autonomy.
*   **C: Diphetogo Tsa Kwa Belgium** - The text explicitly says that parts of modern-day Belgium used to be part of Luxembourg, but became part of Belgium after the Belgian Revolution. This directly impacted Luxembourg's territory and thus its sovereignty.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **B: Go tsena mo Lekgotleng la Ditšhaba Tse di Kopaneng tsa Yuropa** - While joining the predecessor to the EU was important for Luxembourg, the question asks about factors that **affected** its independence, not factors that were a result of its independence.
*   **D: Go nna naga e e ikemetseng** - This is more of a goal or state of being than a condition that affected its sovereignty. The question asks about conditions that impacted its ability to be independent, not simply being independent itself.

Therefore, **A** and **C** are the most direct and relevant answers based on the given text."
Ke dikilometara di le kae tsa sekwere tsa naga ya Turkey tse di mo Yuropa?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The passage states: ""Lefelo la Turkey, go akaretsa le matsha, le disekwere khilomithara di le 783,562 (300,948 sq mi), tse mo go tsone disekwere khilomithara di le 755,688 (291,773 sq mi) di leng kwa borwa-bophirima jwa Asia le disekwere khilomithara di le 23,764 (9,174 sq mi) di leng kwa Yuropa.""
"
"Go ya ka serapa, Turkey e boleele jwa dikilometara di le kae?","The correct answer is **A: 1600**.

The passage states: ""Tshimo ya kwa Turkey e bogolo jo bo fetang dikhilomithara di le 1,600 (dimaele di le 1,000) ka boleele...""
"
Puo ya Selatine e dirisiwa jang kwa Toropong ya Vatican?,"The correct answer is **A: Mekete ya bodumedi**.

The passage states, ""Selatine ga ntsi se dirisiwa mo medirong ya tsa tumelo."" (Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.)
"
"Kwa Toropong ya Vatican, Setadiana ga se dirisiwe mo go eng?","The correct answer is **C: Mekete ya bodumedi**.

The passage states that Latin is often used in religious ceremonies. Italian is used in legal documents, official communications, and daily conversations.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke melemo efe e e latelang ya go kopanya modumo mo dikhomputareng tse di raraaneng?","The correct answer is **A: Mmino**.

The paragraph specifically states: ""Mmino ga ntsi o gatisiwa ka dikhomputara tse di tlhatlhameng go tsamaisa le go tswakanya medumo mmogo."" This directly connects music with the use of sophisticated computers for sound management and mixing. The other options are related to visuals or construction which are not mentioned in the context of sophisticated computers for mixing sound.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, bontsi jwa matlo a a mo lefelong lefe a ne a na le matlwana a boithomelo a a tlhatswang metsi?","The answer is **A: Mohenjo-daro**.

The passage states that the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in nearly every house. While other places had bathrooms, the passage specifically mentions the prevalence of flush toilets in those two cities.
"
Ke mafelo afe mo go a a latelang a a neng a na le dithulaganyo tse di tlhabologileng tsa go tsamaisa leswe?,"The correct answers are:

*   **A: Harappa** - The passage explicitly states that Harappa had toilets connected to a complex sewage system.
*   **B: Santorini** - The passage mentions that Minoan towns on Crete and Santorini had complex sewage systems, meaning Santorini had them as well.
*   **C: Egepeto** - The passage mentions that there were toilets in ancient Egypt.
*   **D: China** - The passage mentions that there were toilets in ancient China.

So the answer is **all of the above.**"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e dirang gore motshameki a retologe?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Matlhakore a mabedi go bapa le legare la sekete**.

The passage describes how the *sides* of the blade, and their ability to angle into the ice, are what cause the skater to turn.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mafoko afe mo go a a latelang a a tlhalosang sentle phatlha e e mo letlhakoreng la seketswana sa gompieno?","Based on the paragraph, the best answer is **B: Go kobega** (which translates to ""curved"" or ""bent"").

The paragraph describes the edges of the blades as ""a a obegelegang ka fa gare"" which means ""two edges that bend inwards"". This is the most accurate description of the groove compared to the other options.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke thulaganyo efe e e dirang gore diatomo di kgone go ntsha maatla a a feteletseng mo leseding?","The correct answer is **B: Go ntshiwa ga difothone go go tlhotlheletsang** (Go ntshiwa ga marang a a fetlhilweng).

The paragraph explicitly states: ""Baitsesaense ba bitsa tsamaiso eno go re ke """"go ntshiwa ga marang a a fetlhilweng"""" ka go nne diathomo di fetlhwa ke lesedi le le tsabakelang, le le bakang go re go ntshiwe photon ya lesedi..."" This translates to ""Scientists call this process """"stimulated emission"""" because atoms are stimulated by light, causing the emission of a photon of light...""

Therefore, the process of atoms releasing excess energy from light is called stimulated emission (go ntshiwa ga marang a a fetlhilweng), which is the same as **go ntshiwa ga difothone go go tlhotlheletsang.**
"
Ke eng se se dirang gore atomo e ntshe fotone?,"The correct answer is **B: Tlhotlheletso e e bakwang ke lesedi le le phatsimang** (Influence caused by shimmering light).

The passage explicitly states that atoms are stimulated by ""lesedi le le tsabakelang"" (shimmering light), causing them to emit a photon.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se kgabagare se tla dirang gore tleloupo e emise go bereka?","The correct answer is **C: Thapo e e mo teng ga tleloupu e a tima**.

The passage states that ""Morago ga sebaka sa diora tse di makgolo, lebone le ne la felela le sha le bole sa tlhole le bereka"" which translates to ""After hundreds of hours, the light bulb eventually burned out and stopped working."" Burning out implies the filament (thapo e e mo teng ga tleloupu) has broken.
"
Ke efe mo go tse di latelang e e ka nnang kotsi go se ama fa o fetola tleloupo?,"The correct answer is **C: Beisi ya tleloupu**.

The passage explicitly warns about touching the base of the lightbulb (beisi ya tleloupu) while part of it is still in the socket because it can cause electric shock. While touching the Mogala (A & D) and switšhi ya lebone (B) may be dangerous in other scenarios, the passage specifically warns against touching the base of the lightbulb when changing it.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, go direga eng fa nutlease e kgaogana?","The correct answer is **B: Go ntshiwa maatla**

The first sentence of the paragraph states: ""Bomb ya Fission e dira ka molaotheo wa gore e tsaya maatla go go kopantsha nucleus le diproton tse dintsi le dineutron."" This implies that when the nucleus is split (as in fission), energy is released.
"
Ke efe mo go tse di latelang e e bontshang gore go na le difouno tsa sekgala se seleele tse di yang kwa Lefatsheng,"The correct answer is **B: Disathalaete**.

The passage states that satellites in space receive calls and send them back down, enabling long-distance phone calls.
"
Ke efe ya tsone e e dirisiwang go romela thelesekoupo mo lefaufaung?,"The correct answer is **B: Didirisiwa tsa rokete**.

The text states: ""Go tsaya rokete e kgolo thata bogodimo jwa dikgato di feta 100 go ya kwa godimo go baya sathalaete kgotsa thelesekoupu mo lefaufaung."" This clearly indicates that rockets are used to send telescopes into space.
"
Ke eng se re tshwanetseng go se ela tlhoko ka tiragalo e e diregang gangwe le gape gore re kgone go bona gore nako e tsamaya jang?,"The correct answer is **B: Go boeletsa**.

The passage states: ""O kgona go tshwaya go feta ga nako ka bowena ka go lebelela dilo tse di diragalelang ka **go ipoeletsa kgapetsakgapetsa**."" This directly links the repetition of events (go boeletsa) to the perception of the passage of time.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, nako e dirisiwa go tshwantsha karolo efe ya tiragalo?","The correct answer is **A: Boleele**.

The passage states: ""Nako e dirisiwa gape go lekanya **lobaka** lwa ditiragalo.""  Lobaka translates to ""duration"" or ""length"".
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e tsewang e le e e tshwanelang moruaboswa wa bogosi?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **B: O tlogela yunibesithi gore a ye bosoleng.**

Lebaka:

Serapa se supa gore tlwaelo e ne e le gore moja-boswa a tsene sesole fa a sena go fetsa sekolo (ka tlhamalalo). Se ga se tlhalose gore ba ne ba tlogela yunibesithi gore ba ye sesoleng, fela se supa gore fa ba fetsa sekolo, ba ne ba ya sesoleng. Dikarabo tse dingwe ga di nepagala ka:

The passage states that Olaf Trygvasson was a Norwegian man.
"
Jeremane e ne ya tlhotlheletsa setso sa Estonia thata ka nako efe?,"The passage states that Northern Estonia was under significant German cultural influence in the 15th century.  Since it is currently the 21st century, the 15th century was approximately 600 years ago.

Therefore, the answer is C: Dingwaga di ka nna 600 tse di fetileng.
"
Ke eng se se neng sa tlhotlheletsa puo ya Seestonia?,"The best answer is **B: Alefabete ya Sejeremane** and **C: Baitlami ba Majeremane**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states the Estonian language was based on the German alphabet (""E ne e theilwe mo alfabeteng ya Sejeremane..."").
*   The passage also states that ""Baruti bangwe ba ma-Jeremane ba ne ba batla go atametsa Modimo mo bathong ba ba tlholegang mo lefelong le, ka jalo ba simolola teme e e seng bofitlha ya se-Estonia"".

Therefore, both the German alphabet and German Monks greatly influenced the Estonian language.

Here's why the other options are not as good:

*   **A: Tlhaka Õ/õ** - While the letter Õ/õ is part of the Estonian alphabet, it's a *result* of the influence, not the influence itself.
*   **D: Modimo** - God was the *reason* the monks created the language, but not a direct influence on the language's structure or vocabulary."
"Go ya ka serapa, palo ya batho ba ba buang Se-Hindi e farologana go ya ka ntlha efe?","The correct answer is **A: Fa go balwa dipuo tse di tshwanang thata le Se-Hindi**.

The passage states: ""Palo ya batho ba ba buang puo ya bone ya tlholego ba a farologana go ya ka go re a palo ya ya tsela ya go bua e amana gaufi thata kgotsa nnyo."" This translates to ""The number of native speakers varies depending on whether closely related dialects are counted."" This is equivalent to option A: ""Fa go balwa dipuo tse di tshwanang thata le Se-Hindi"" meaning ""When counting languages that are very similar to Se-Hindi"".
"
Ke mafoko afe a a latelang a a boammaaruri ka Sehindi le Seurdu?,"The correct answer is **B: Di farologana ka mokwalo**.

The passage states: ""Teme ya Hindi le ya Urdu di tshwana ka puo mme di farologana mo go kwaleng."" (Hindi and Urdu are similar in spoken language but different in writing.)
"

"
"Go ya ka temana e, ke dipuo dife tse di neng tsa tlhotlhelediwa ke Sanskrit?","The correct answer is **D: Dipuo tsa India**.

The passage states ""...Sanskrit ke puo e e thata tota e e humileng, e e leng yone e diteme tse dintsi tsa segompieno tsa letso la se-India di simologileng ka yone..."". This directly indicates that many modern Indian languages originated from Sanskrit.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, go ne ga fokotsega go dirisiwa ga Sanskrit ka ntlha ya eng?","The correct answer is **D: Thulaganyotatelano**.

The paragraph explicitly states: ""Morago ga gore Upanishads e kgobokanngwe, Sanskrit e ile ya nyelela ka ntlha ya thulaganyotatelano."" (After the Upanishads were compiled, Sanskrit declined due to grammaticalization/standardization).
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mafoko afe a a latelang a a boammaaruri malebana le kgogelofatshe a Io?","The correct answer is **A: Maatla a magolo a lefatshe a ka go gogela kwa tlase go feta maatla a magolo a lefatshe**

The passage states that you would weigh less on Io than on Earth, meaning that gravity is pulling you down less.  This is a direct consequence of Io's lower gravitational force.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mafoko afe mo go a a latelang a a tlhalosang sentle gore ngwedi o na le karolo efe e e kwa ntle?","The correct answer is **A: Kafa letlhakoreng le le fa gaufi go na le dikgapetla tse di motsu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the outer layer of the moon is called the crust (legogo).
*   It then says that this crust is about 70km thick on the near side (letlhakoreng le le gaufi) and 100km on the far side.
*   Because the crust is thinner on the near side, this means it's thinner on the near side(Kafa letlhakoreng le le fa gaufi)
*   Option A (Kafa letlhakoreng le le fa gaufi go na le dikgapetla tse di motsu) which says that the near side has thin crusts, it aligns directly with the information in the passage.

The other options are not directly supported by the text in the same way:

*   B: Talks about thin soil in the mountains, but the passage mentions the crust in general, not specifically soil within mountains.
*   C and D: Mention ""maria"" (mawatle), the passage suggests that they *might* be more numerous on the near side because of the thinner crust, but it's not a definitive statement about their presence being lower under mountains or about them being smaller."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke kae mo kgolokwe ya ngwedi e leng tona thata gone?","The correct answer is **C: Kwa tlase ga dithaba**.

The paragraph states that the crust (legogo) is ""lekimanyana fa tlase ga dithota,"" which translates to ""thinnest under the mountains."" Therefore, the area under the mountains has the thickest crust.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang e batho bangwe ba e dumelang?","The correct answer is **C: Go na le botshelo mo dipolaneteng tse dingwe**

The passage states: ""...bangwe ba dumela go re go na le batho ba ba sa tsheleng jaaka rona kgotsa botshelo jo bongwe jo bo farologanang le jwa rona."" This directly indicates that some people believe there is life on other planets.
"
Ke eng se se nnang sennye fa o ntse o katogela kgakala le bogare jwa letsatsi?,"The correct answer is **C: Gase**.

The passage states ""Mowa o a hokotsega fa o ntse o tswa mo bogareng ba letsatsi,"" which translates to ""Gas decreases as you move away from the center of the sun.""
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke karolo efe ya letsatsi e e bonalang go tswa mo lefatsheng?","The correct answer is **C: Photosphere**.

The paragraph states: ""Selo se re se bonang mo bokafatleng jwa letsatsi se bidiwa photosphere, mo go rayang go re ”kgolokwe ya lesedi”."" (What we see on the surface of the sun is called the photosphere, which means ""sphere of light""). This directly answers the question.
"
Ke eng se se neng sa thusa go tlhomamisa kgopolo ya ga Copernicus?,"The correct answer is **A: Dikarolo tsa Venus**.

The passage explicitly states that ""Maphata a a Venus a rurifaditse kakanyetso ya ga Copernicus ya go re dipolanete di dikologa latsatsi."" (The phases of Venus confirmed Copernicus' theory that the planets revolve around the sun.)
"
Galileo Galilei o ne a bona eng mo go seno se se latelang ka 1610?,"The correct answer is **B: Dikarolo tsa Venus**.

The passage states, ""Galileo Galilei o dirisitse selebakgakala sa dinaledi go lemoga fa Venus e na le maphata a mabedi, fela jaaka ngwedi."" This directly translates to ""Galileo Galilei used a telescope to discover that Venus has phases, just like the moon.""
"
"Go ya ka serapa, Noka ya Amazon e tsaya metsi kae?","The correct answer is **A: Dinoka tse dinnye**.

The paragraph states: ""E tsaya metsi a yone go tswa mo dinokaneng tse dinnye di le diketekete."" which translates to ""It takes its water from thousands of small streams"".
"
Ke tlotlo efe e e sa newang Noka ya Amazon?,"The correct answer is **C: Ke noka e telele go di feta tsotlhe**

The passage states the Amazon is the *second* longest river, not the longest. The other options are all facts supported by the text.
"
Ke tiro efe e go buiwang ka yone mo serapeng seno e e thapang Ba-Venezuela ba le mmalwa?,"The correct answer is **C: Oli**.

The paragraph states ""...le fa gone e le peresente e le nngwe fela ya batho e e dirang kwa bodirelong jwa lookwane."" This clearly indicates that only a small percentage of Venezuelans work in the oil industry. The other options employ larger portions of the workforce.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke lefapha lefe mo go a a latelang le le thapang batho ba le bantsi go gaisa mo Venezuela?","Correct Answer: A: Tirelo

**Reasoning:**

The paragraph states: ""Nngwe-peding ya batho ba kwa Venezuela ba ba dirang ba mo ditirong tsa ditirelo..."" which translates to ""One-half of the working people in Venezuela are in the service sector...""

The other options have lower percentages or less direct mentions:

*   **Madirelo (Industry):** ""...mo e ka nnnang sephatlo sa bone ba dira mo madirelong..."" (approximately one-quarter work in industry).
*   **Temothuo (Agriculture):** ""...nngwe-tlhanong ya bone ba dira mo temo-thuong"" (one-fifth work in agriculture).
*   **Oli (Oil):** ""...e le peresente e le nngwe fela ya batho e e dirang kwa bodirelong jwa lookwane"" (only one percent work in the oil industry).

Since one-half is the largest proportion, the service sector employs the most people."
"Go ya ka serapa, go kopana ga dinaledi go dira gore dinaledi di kgone go dira eng?","The correct answer is **C: Go ntsha lesedi le mogote**.

The paragraph states that stars produce light and heat because of the energy released when hydrogen atoms fuse together.
"
Ke eng se se latelang se se ka dirwang ke motshodi wa nutliliya o o nang le mosola?,"The passage states that nuclear fusion reactors aim to replicate the energy production process of stars by fusing hydrogen atoms to create heavier elements. The goal is to generate power in a similar way. Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **D: Maatla a Motlakase (Electrical Power)**

Explanation: The ultimate goal of a viable nuclear fusion reactor is to produce electrical power."
Metsi a dirilwe ka dikhemikale dife?,"The correct answer is **D: Diathomo se pedi tsa haeterojene le athomo e le nngwe ya okosejene**.

The passage states: ""Kopanyo ya metsi e dirilwe ka athomo tse pedi tsa hydrogen le atom e le nngwe ya mowa o phepha.""  (The compound of water is made of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen).
"
"Fa metsi a fetoga, ke eng se se tla nnelang ruri?","The correct answer is **A: Sebopego sa dimolekhule**.

The passage states that ""Le fa sebopego sa yone se ka fetoga, seemo sa yone sa khemikhale se nna se le jalo."" Since the molecular structure determines the chemical composition, and that remains the same during a phase change, the molecular structure is what remains constant.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e neng e se bothata mo dinageng tse di lesome le boraro fa di ne di leka go tlhoma melao e e rileng?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **A: Puso e dira ka natla go laola dilo**.

"
"Go ya ka temana, ke nonofo efe ya Mantswe a kwa Giza e Baegepeto ba Bogosi jo Bosha ba neng ba sa e rate?","The correct answer is **C: Bogolo jwa tsone (Their size)**.

The passage states ""...diphiramiti tsa Giza le ka motlha di ne di sa fetiwe ke dipe ka bogolo le ka botswerere jwa setegeniki jwa go agiwa ga tsone"" and ""Bogosi jo Bosha jwa Baegepeto ba bogologolo ba ne ba jesiwa kgakge ke dikago tseno tse dikgolo..."". This directly indicates that the size of the pyramids was something that impressed the New Kingdom Egyptians.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ditshedi tse di jang dimela di tsamaya di tswa kae go ya go batla dipula?","The correct answer is **A: Dithota tse di kwa bokone**.

"
"Go ya ka temana eno, diphologolo tse di jang ditlhare le bojang di tswa mo lefelong lefe ka kgwedi ya Moranang?","The correct answer is **B: Dithota tse di kwa borwa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Go tswa fo di boela gape kwa bokone di feta ka fa bophirima, di tshela gape noka ya Mara, morago ga dipula ka kgwedi ya Moranang.""  This implies they are starting their journey *from* the southern plains *after* the rains in April.
"
Operation Sealion e ne e le tlhaselo ya naga efe?,"The correct answer is **B: Borithane**.

The passage states that ""Jeremane ya simolola go ipaakanyetsa go tlhasela setlhaketlhake sa Boritane. Jeremane e ne ya bitsa tlhaselo eo """"Operation Sealion"""". "" which translates to ""Germany began preparing to invade the island of Britain. Germany called the invasion ""Operation Sealion"".""

"
Ke eng se se sa umakiwang e le kgato e e tlhokegang mo thulaganyong ya Italy ya go gapa dinaga tsa Aforika?,"The correct answer is **B: Go aga dikepe tse dingwe**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that Italy *already* built four new ships before the war. The passage does not say that they had to build more ships for their plan to succeed.
*   The other options are explicitly mentioned as necessary steps:
    *   Establishing a landing base for soldiers (C) is stated as a requirement for invading Africa.
    *   Neutralizing British military and naval bases in Egypt (A and D) is stated to be a requirement for the invasion."
"Go ya ka serapa, boikaelelo jo bogolo jwa ntwa ya Italy e ne e le bofe?","The correct answer is **A: Go gapa mafatshe a Aferika**.

The passage states: ""Maikaelelo magolo a Italy e ne e le dinaga tsa Aforika."" (The main goal of Italy was the countries of Africa.)

"
"""Ke bomang ba Balekane ba ba neng ba nna le seabe mo """"Operation Dragoon?""""""","The correct answer is **A: Baamerika le Bafora ba ba Gololesegileng**.

"
Ke thekenoloji efe e e neng ya dira gore dikepe tsa kafa tlase ga metsi di simolole go tsamaya kafa tlase ga metsi?,"The correct answer is **D: Radar**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that as ""didiriswa tsa go tsibosa di simolola go tlhabololwa le go nepa dilo le go feta"" (detection devices improved and became more accurate), submarines were forced to go underwater to avoid detection.
*   Radar is a key detection technology that would force submarines to submerge to avoid being seen."
"Ka nako ya fa dikepe tse di tsamayang kafa tlase ga metsi di ne di dirisiwa lekgetlho la ntlha, di ne di kgona go fofa ka selekanyo se se lekanyeditsweng mo karolong efe?","The correct answer is **C: Go thunya**.

The passage states: ""Ka nako eo di ne di le bonya e bile di ne di sa kgone go thunyetsa kgakala."" (At that time they were slow and could not shoot far.) This directly addresses the limitation of submarines during their early use.
"

"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mekgwa efe e e latelang e e leng karolo ya botlhokwa ya go tlhatlhanya ga Setibetan?","The correct answer is **A, B, and C**. Here's why:

*   **B: Go boeletsa melaetsa** : The passage says ""maikanopoelelo"" which implies repeating messages or affirmations which is a part of Kundalini Yoga
*   **C: Go bona medimo ka leitlho la mogopolo :** The passage states that ""Fa motho a akanya thata medimo e e farologanyeng"" (When a person thinks deeply about different deities) which means visualizing deities is central to their meditative practice.
*   **D: Go ithuta go dira yoga:** While yoga in general is part of Tibetan Buddhism, the passage specifically refers to Kundalini Yoga, not just learning how to do yoga.

Therefore, A, B, and C are the core practices specifically mentioned in the passage as important to Tibetan meditation."
"Go ya ka serapa, di-chakra di tshubiwa jang ka nako ya go tlhatlhanya ga Setibet?","The correct answer is **A: Ka go dirisa mekgwa e e farologaneng ya yoga**.

The paragraph mentions Kundalini Yoga, which involves breathing exercises and visualizations to awaken Kundalini energy. This falls under the umbrella of ""different forms of yoga"". While visualizing deities (option B) is also mentioned, it's specifically linked to *ego-self transformation* (itigo-maikutlo), not directly to burning chakras during meditation in general. Options C and D are parts of yoga, but not the overarching method, making A the best answer.
"

The passage states: ""nako fela e mapodise ba kgonneng go tshwara Rre Reid e le fa a fokotsa lobelo go ya ko go sekgele sa dikhilomithara tse 160 ka aura."" This clearly indicates that the police were able to use their speed guns only when he slowed down to 160 km/h.

The passage clearly states that ""Kgolegelo ya kwa Iraq ya Abu Ghraib e fisitswe ka nako ya ditshupetso"" which translates to ""The Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq was burned during the protests.""
"

The passage states: ""Baagi ba le mmalwa ba Bishbek ba ne ba pega badiraditshupetso ba ba tswang kwa borwa molato ka ntlha ya botlhokatsebe jwa bone."" This translates to ""Several Bishkek residents blamed protesters from the south for their irresponsibility.""
"
Ke mang yo o neng a pega babopeledi ba kwa borwa molato wa go utswa dilo?,"The correct answer is **A: Baagi ba Bishkek**.

The passage states: ""Baagi ba le mmalwa ba Bishbek ba ne ba pega badiraditshupetso ba ba tswang kwa borwa molato ka ntlha ya botlhokatsebe jwa bone."" This directly translates to ""Several Bishkek residents blamed protesters from the south for their carelessness,"" implying they also blamed them for the looting.

"
Jamie Siminoff o ne a swetsa leng go simolola Ring?,"The correct answer is **A: Fa a sena go lemoga gore tshitswana e e kokotang,ya lebentlele, e ne e sa utlwale.**

The passage states: ""mookamedi wa Ring, Jamie Siminoff, o ne a tshwaela fa kompone e simolotswe fa tshitswana e e kokotang ya lebentlele e ne e sa utlwale fa a le ko mabeelong a dikoloi. A re o dirile tshitswana e e kokotang ya WiFi."" This directly indicates the company was started because he couldn't hear the doorbell.
"
Kgaolo nngwe le nngwe ya Reading Rainbow e ne e naya bana dikatlageniso tsa eng?,"The correct answer is **D: Dibuka**.

The passage states: ""Tshupegetso nngwe le nngwe e ntsha kaelo ya dibuka tse bana ba ka di batlang fa ba ya ko motlobong wa dibuka wa bone."" This clearly indicates that each episode provided recommendations of books for children.
"
"""Ke eng se se ka tswang se bakile gore go phimolwe motseletsele wa """"Reading Rainbow""""?""","The passage states: ""Bangwe, ba ba akaretsang John Grant, ba dumela go re go fokodiwa ga madi a a abelwang bagasi, ga mmogo le go fetola megopolo ka go re kgaso ya dithulaganyo tsa thuto e tshwanetse go nna jang, go nnile le seabe mo go emisiweng ga thulaganyo e."" This directly points to insufficient funding as a contributing factor.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Madi a a sa lekaneng (Insufficient funds)**.

"Go ya ka motlhatlhobi yo mogolo wa RSPCA, ditlhatlhobo di tshwanetse go nna selo se se tlwaelegileng mo go dife tsa dilo tse di latelang?","The correct answer is **D: Dikago tsa polao ya diphologolo**.

The passage states that RSPCA calls for CCTV to be mandatory *in Australian slaughterhouses*. Also, David O'Shannessy said that monitoring slaughterhouses should be standard in Australia. So, dikago tsa polao ya diphologolo refers to slaughterhouses.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se se ka thusang go gatelela kafa go leng botlhokwa ka teng gore badiri ba kwa mafelong a go bolaelwang diphologolo kwa go one kwa Australia ba tlhokomele diphologolo?","The correct answer is **A: Go tsenya dikhamera tsa CCTV**.

The paragraph states that the RSPCA believes installing CCTV cameras in Australian slaughterhouses would send a ""strong message"" to workers about the importance of animal welfare.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, motho yo o neng a tshwarwa o ne a dira tiro efe?","The correct answer is **A: Moithuti (Student)**.

The paragraph states: ""moithuti yo mongwe yo neng a amana le go thuntsha tlhobolo kwa sekolong ka Mopitlwe 21, o tshwarwe."" This directly translates to ""another student who was involved in the school shooting on March 21, was arrested.""
"
"Go ya ka serapa, fa go ntse go anamisiwa dikgang tsa go tshwarwa gape, go ne go tshwerwe diphitlho tsa batho ba le kae?","The correct answer is **D: Nnè**.

The paragraph states ""jaaka diphitlho tsa ga Jeff Weise le batswa-setlhabelo ba bararo mo go ba le robongwe di ne di tshwerwe"" which means that Jeff Weise's funeral and the funerals of three victims out of the nine were held. That makes a total of four funerals.
"
Ke naga efe e e neng ya se ka ya tswelela pele ka tumalano ya yone ya ACTA e e neng ya saenwa ka ntlha ya ditshupetso?,"The correct answer is **B: Poland**. The text explicitly states that Poland decided not to ratify the agreement due to protests.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dinaga tse di latelang e e neng ya swetsa ka gore e busetse morago thulaganyo ya go nna leloko la ACTA?","The correct answer is **D: Latvia**.

The paragraph states: ""Latvia le Slovakia ka bobedi ba diile tsamaiso ya go inaakanya le ACTA."" This translates to ""Latvia and Slovakia both postponed the process of joining ACTA."" This implies that they stopped the process of joining, which is the same as reversing it.
"
Ke batho ba le kae ba ba neng ba gobala ka ntlha ya ditiragalo tsa go gotela ga di-iPod?,"The correct answer is **A: Bone**.

The passage states: ""dikgobalo tse di seng masisi tsa molelo"" which implies four people had minor burn injuries due to the overheating iPods.
"
Ke mang yo o neng a re ditiragalo tsa go gotela thata ga di masisi?,"The correct answer is **D: Apple**.

The passage states that Apple described the 34 overheating incidents as ""not serious.""
"
"Ka nako ya puo ya gagwe, Steve Jobs o ne a re Apple e tlile go dira eng gape?","The correct answer is **A: Hisitori (History)**.

The passage states: ""Ka nako ya puo ya gagwe ya dioura tse 2, o ne a bolela go re """"Gompieno Apple e tlile go nchafatsa mosokelatsebeng. Re tlile go dira ditso gompieno"""".""  This translates to ""During his 2-hour speech, he said, ""Today Apple is going to reinvent the phone. We are going to make history today.""
"
Boikaelelo jwa puo ya diura tse pedi ya ga Steve Jobs e ne e le bofe?,"The correct answer is **C: Go ribolola founo e ntšhwa**.

The passage explicitly states that Steve Jobs took an iPhone out of his pocket and said Apple was going to ""reinvent the phone."" This clearly indicates the purpose of the presentation was to unveil a new phone.
"
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner o ne a itsise eng kwa Theater ya Argentina?,"The correct answer is **A: Go tlhophiwa ga gagwe go nna moporesidente**.

The passage states: ""Mohumagadi Kirchner o itsisitse ka maikaelelo a gagwe a go emela maemo a bo tautona kwa lefelo la bodiragatsi la Argentine...""  This directly translates to Mrs. Kirchner announcing her intention to run for president at the Argentinian Theatre.
"
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner o ne a itsise kae gore o batla go tsenela bosole?,"The correct answer is **C: Kwa Theatereng ya Argentina e e dikhilometara di le 31 go tswa kwa Buenos Aires**.

Here's why:

* The passage states she announced her presidential bid at ""lefelo la bodiragatsi la Argentine,"" which translates to Argentine Theatre.
* The passage also specifies that La Plata is 50 kilometers (approximately 31 miles) from Buenos Aires.
* The information contained in the passage matches option C.
"
ACMA e ne ya lemoga eng malebana le Big Brother?,"The correct answer is **A: Go ne go sa tlolwa melao ya kanamiso kitso ya mo inthaneteng**.

The passage states that ACMA found that Big Brother did not violate online content rules.
"
Metswedi ya tshedimosetso e tshwanetse go nna le ditekanyetso dife gore e tsewe e le diteng tsa Inthanete?,"Based on the information in statement P, the correct answer is **A: E tshwanetse ya bo e le mo Inthaneteng**.

Statement P states that for the Broadcast Services Act (which contains the Internet Content Scheme) to apply, the content must be considered ""Internet content"" and specifically, that simply streaming a video online *doesn't* automatically qualify it as such if it's not hosted on a website. This implies that the primary qualifier is being *on* the internet.
"

This translates to: ""Mr. Peter Costello, the Australian Treasurer, and also the man who could have succeeded Prime Minister John Howard who is the leader of the Liberal political party...""

Therefore, John Howard is the leader of the Liberal party.

So the correct answer is **B: John Howard**.
"
"""Ke ka ntlha yang fa Australia e ise e nne le madirelo a motlakase wa maranyane a """"nuclear""""?""","Based on the provided text (P), the correct answer is **D: Go ja madi a mantsi thata.**

Here's why:

*   The text says ""Rre Costello a re fa go dirwa ga maatla a nuklea go siamela itsholelo, Australia e tshwanetse go latelela tiriso ya one. Fa e ka nna e tlisang kgwebo, re tshwanetse ra nna le yone."" This implies that the reason Australia hasn't pursued nuclear power is related to its economic feasibility (or lack thereof), therefore it would cost a lot of money.

The other options are less directly supported by the text:

*   **A: Go tlhoka tshegetso ya setšhaba** (Lack of public support): While public support could be a factor, it's not directly mentioned.
*   **B: Go ganetsana thata** (Strong opposition): Similar to public support, opposition could exist, but it's not the primary reason mentioned.
*   **C: Go kotsi thata** (Very dangerous): While safety is a concern for nuclear power, the text focuses on economic considerations."
Ke mothadisi ofe wa ski yo o neng a gaisana a thusiwa ke mokaedi?,"The correct answer is **C: Maciej Krezel**.

The passage states: ""Moreledi wa kapoko wa skiing, wa monna, wa kwa Poland, Maciej Krezel, le mokaedi wa gagwe, Anna Ogarzynska, ba feditse mo maemong a bolesome-le-boraro mo Super-G.""
"
Ke naga efe e e neng ya wetsa e le ya bolesome mo kgaisanong ya Super-G ya basadi ba ba emeng?,"The correct answer is **A: Finland**.

The text states that ""Finland ka Katja Saarinen a fetsa mo maemong a bolesome mo go yone kgaisano eo,"" and ""eo"" refers to the women's standing Super-G competition.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke polelo efe e e seng boammaaruri ka Blake?","The correct answer is **B: O ne a dumela gore ke ene a mo tlhasetseng**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Mogasi denied the assault. Blake was arrested for trying to obstruct justice, not for the assault itself.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se se latelang se se neng sa se ka sa diragalela Blake?","The correct answer is **C: O ne a tlhaselwa ka thobane**.

The passage states:

*   Blake was arrested for attempting to pervert the course of justice. (B is true)
*   The judge told Blake that it was ""almost inevitable"" he would be sent to prison. (D is true - this implies he might be sent to prison)
*   While it doesn't explicitly state Blake *was* found guilty, the judge's statement strongly suggests this is the outcome, and therefore A is likely.

The passage mentions the other person used a plank to defend himself from bottles being thrown, but it doesn't mention Blake being attacked with a plank. Therefore, C is the action that did not happen to Blake.
"
Letlole la Lekgotla la Ditšhaba la go lwantsha go thuthafala ga lefatshe ga le kitla le dirisiwa go dira eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Go tlisetsa dinaga tse di tlhabologang maranyane (To provide developing countries with technology)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that *providing technologies to help developing countries grow in less polluting ways* is a separate item on the agenda in Bali. It's not part of the purpose of the U.N.'s fund for dealing with the impacts of global warming.

*   The passage *does* mention that the fund's money can be used for:
    *   Building flood-resistant houses (**C: Matlo a a sa gogolweng ke metsi**)
    *   Using water efficiently (**implied within D: Go fokotsa ditlamorago tsa go thuthafala ga lefatshe**)
    *   Farming diverse crops (**A: Dijalo tse di farologaneng**)
    *   Helping countries cope with the impacts of global warming (**D: Go fokotsa ditlamorago tsa go thuthafala ga lefatshe**)"
"Go ya ka temana e, ke eng se Lekgotla la Ditšhaba le solofetseng go se boloka?","The correct answer is **C: Dikgwa tse di ratwang ke pula tse di setseng.**

The first sentence of the passage states that one of the topics at the Bali conference is ""go boloka dikgwa tse di setseng tsa lefatshe"" (to save the remaining forests of the world). While the U.N. is establishing a fund to help countries deal with the effects of global warming, the direct effort mentioned about saving something specifically refers to the forests.
"
Albert Muchanga o ne a sa umake eng mo go seno se se latelang jaaka sengwe se se neng se sa ntse se tlhoka go dumalanwa ka sone?,"The correct answer is **A: Fa Benin e ka nna leloko la AfCTA**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Albert Muchanga o begile go re Benin e tla nna leloko."" This indicates Benin's membership is already reported as a confirmed event, not something still needing agreement.
*   The passage also mentions: ""Ga re ise re dumalane ka melao ya tlhago le go fokoletswa lekgetho..."" This directly states that the rules of origin and tariff reductions were still needing agreement.
*   Finally, the passage says: ""Popego e re nang le yone e siame go re go ka simololwa kgwebisano ka kgwedi ya Phukwi a tlhola letsatsi 2020"". This indicates that the date was set.

Therefore, the only option not presented as something needing further agreement is Benin's membership."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke ka ntlha yang fa kgwebo e ka simolola ka kgwedi ya Phukwe?","The correct answer is **C: E ne ya amogelwa ke mokomišenara wa kgwebo le madirelo wa AU**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states that the commissioner said that ""the framework we have is good enough to start trading by July 1, 2020"". This indicates that the commissioner's approval of the existing framework is the reason trade can begin in July. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While Nigeria joining AfCFTA is mentioned, the July start date isn't explicitly tied to its membership conditions in the provided text.
*   **B:** The passage explicitly says they *haven't* agreed on rules of origin.
*   **D:** Again, the passage states they *haven't* agreed on rules of origin and tariff concessions.

"
"Go ya ka serapa, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution e ne ya latofatsa badiredibagolo ba thuto ka eng?","The correct answer is **C: Go se tseye kgato malebana le mathata a ka fa gare a a lemogilweng**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pego e ne ya supa dipholo tsa tlhatlhobo tse di oketsegileng ka bonako thata, go belaelwa fa sekolo nne sa itemogela mathata mme sa seke sa tsaya matsapa ape."" This directly translates to the report indicating suspiciously rapid test score increases and a suspicion that schools were experiencing problems but not taking any action.
"
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e neilweng mo serapeng, ke eng se se neng se sa umakiwe mo pegong ya Atlanta Journal-Constitution?","The correct answer is **D: Ditshitshinyo tsa go tlhabolola thuto ya ditoropo.**

Here's why:

*   **A: Go tokafala e kgolo mo dintlheng tsa thuto.** (Significant improvements in test scores) - The passage mentions that Atlanta schools saw significant improvements in test scores. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported on issues with test results, which implies discussion about these improvements.
*   **B: Bosupi jwa gore dipampiri tsa tlhatlhobo di ne di fetotswe** (Evidence that test papers were changed) - The passage says that later evidence indicated that test papers had been tampered with, indicating they would not be mentioned in the report.
*   **C: Mofenyi wa 2013 wa National Superintendent of the Year** (2013 Winner of National Superintendent of the Year) - The passage states that Hall, along with thirty-four other school administrators, were indicted in 2013. Indicating they would not be a winner.
*   **D: Ditshitshinyo tsa go tlhabolola thuto ya ditoropo** (Suggestions for improving urban education) - The passage focuses on Hall's accolades, the test score scandal, and the resulting legal action. It doesn't mention any specific suggestions or recommendations for improving urban education within the context of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution report."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke tshedimosetso efe e e itsiweng morago ga go thuntshiwa ga bomo?","The correct answer is **B: Dibomo di ne tsa thunya gaufi le dikago dife?**

The paragraph states that bombs detonated outside the chief executive's office and near government buildings. Therefore, we know where the bombs detonated.
"
"Fa e sale a tsena mo Manchester City ka 2017, Jesus o tshamekile metshameko e le kae?","The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The passage states: ""Fa e sa le ka nako eo, mo-Borasili yono o tshameketse setlhopha sa teng mo metsamekong e le masome a matlhano le boraro (53) mo dikgaisanong tsotlhe"".
"
Jesu o ne a amogela madi a a kana ka diranta di le dimilione di le 27 gore a nne leloko la setlhopha sefe?,"The correct answer is **B: Manchester City**.

The passage states that Jesus joined Manchester City from Palmeira for £27 million. The question asks which team he received the £27 million to join.
"
Ke polelo efe e e seng boammaaruri ka baeng ba lefelo la bonno?,"Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **D: Bontsi jwa baeng ba ne ba tswa kwa motseng o o boitshepo.**

Polelo ya re bontsi jwa baeng ba ne e le baagi ba United Arab Emirates, eseng baagi ba Mecca. Ka jalo, polelo D ga se boammaaruri.
"
"Go ya ka temana eno, ke mafoko afe a a latelang a a boammaaruri?","Let's analyze each statement based on the text:

*   **A: Palo ya baswi e ka tshwara 15.** The passage states, ""Palo ya baswi e ka tshwara 15 kgotsa go feta..."" This means the number of deaths could be around 15 or more. So, this statement is likely true.
*   **B: Bontsi jwa baeng ba ne ba tswa kwa United Arab Emirates.** The passage explicitly says, ""Bontsi jwa baeti ba hosetele e ne e le baagi ba United Arab Emirates."" So, this statement is true.
*   **C: Baeng ba ne ba le koo mo maitseboeng a boikhutso jwa Hajj.** The passage states that the incident happened on the morning before the Hajj pilgrimage (""...letsatsi la pele ga fa ba tsaya loeto lwa sedumedi la haji."") Therefore, this statement is false.
*   **D: Bontsi jwa baeng e ne e le batho ba selegae Mecca.** The passage states the majority of the guests were from the United Arab Emirates, not local to Mecca. Therefore, this statement is false.

Therefore, the correct answers are **A** and **B**."
"Go ya ka temana eno, ke tshedimosetso efe e e ka ikanngwang malebana le go thulana ga dikoloi tseno?","The best answer is **B: Lefelo le go thulaneng ka lone**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the collision happened ""mo godimo ga lefatshe ka dimaele di le 491"" (491 miles above the Earth). This is a specific location.
*   **A: Bogolo jwa thulo:** The passage says scientists are *trying* to analyze the magnitude of the impact. This means the size of the collision is *not* yet known with certainty.
*   **C: Ditlamorago tsa go thulana ga tsone mo Lefatsheng:** The passage states that scientists are *trying* to analyze the impact on Earth. This means the effects are *not* yet known with certainty.
*   **D: Lefelo le matlakala a leng mo go lone:** The passage states that the U.S. Department of Defense is tracking the debris. It does not provide the exact location of the debris.

"
"Go ya ka temana eno, ke eng se se sa ntseng se tshwanetse go tlhomamisiwa malebana le go thulana ga tsone?","The correct answer is **C: Tsela e dipholo tsa tshekatsheko ya dipolane di tla abelanwang ka yone**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Ba sa leka go sekaseka go re kotsi e e diragetseng e ne e le bogolo jo bo kae, le go re Lefatshe le tsile go amega jang. ... Maduo a tshekatsheko a tla tsengwa mo maranyaneng a botlhe."" This means the impact size and effect on earth are still being determined, but the results of the analysis *will* be shared publicly online. Therefore, the way the results will be shared is already determined.
*   The other options are incorrect because the passage either states the information outright or implies that it is still under investigation:

    *   **A:** The passage says the U.S. Department of Defense is tracking the debris.
    *   **B:** The passage states their speed when they collided.
    *   **D:** The passage doesn't mention that there was an earthquake and instead says they're working on understanding how the Earth will be affected.

Therefore, the only thing from the answer choices that is certain is the way the analysis results will be shared."
"Go ya ka temana eno, Batten o kile a nna kae mo lenaaneng la Maamerika a a humileng thata?","The correct answer is **C: ya bo190**

The passage states directly that Batten was ranked 190th on the 2008 list of the 400 richest Americans.
"
Batten o ne a ntsha moneelo mo go ofe wa ba ba latelang?,"The correct answer is **B: Yunibesithi ya Virginia** and **D: Kholejeng ya Botaki le Maranyane**.
**Explanation:**

The passage states that Batten ""ne a abela setheo seo go le go ntsi."" ""Setheo seo"" refers back to the ""Kholejeng ya Botaki le Maranyane ya Yunibesithi ya Virginia.""

Therefore, Batten made a significant donation to both the University of Virginia and the College of Arts and Sciences.
"

Molaotlhomo o totile feela thekiso le khuuro ya lipapali tse mabifi tsa video California, e seng linaha tse ling. Likhetho tse ling kaofela li boletsoe polelong."
"Go ya ka temana eno, ke mang yo o neng a sa utlwe se se neng se buiwa?","The correct answer is **C: Miller**.

The passage states: ""Fa a kopiwa tshwaelo, Miller o rile, """"Mike o bua thata mo tshekong... Ke ne ke sentse ke ipaakanya, ke jalo tota ga ke a utlwa se a neng a se bua."""""" (When asked for comment, Miller said, ""Mike talks a lot in the trial... I was already preparing, so I really didn't hear what he was saying."") This clearly indicates that Miller did not hear what Mike was saying.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mafoko afe a a latelang a a boammaaruri malebana le se se neng sa diragalela Miller kwa tshekong?","The correct answer is **B: O ne a sa tlhwaya tsebe fa a ntse a ipaakanya.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Miller said, ""...Ke ne ke sentse ke ipaakanya, ke jalo tota ga ke a utlwa se a neng a se bua."" This directly implies that he wasn't paying attention because he was preoccupied with preparing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Duvall o ne a kgatlha Miller ka nako ya tsheko:** The passage implies Duvall had interesting ideas, but it doesn't say he *impressed* Miller during the trial itself.
*   **C: Bana ba ga Duvall ba babedi ba ne ba bua thata ka nako ya tsheko:** The passage mentions Duvall has two grown children but doesn't say anything about them being at the trial or being loud.
*   **D: O ne a reetsa kgang ya ga Duvall ka kelotlhoko:** This is the opposite of what the passage indicates. Miller explicitly says he *didn't* hear what Duvall was saying."
Ke mang yo o neng a tshitshinya gore go fetolwe ‘Clean Air Act’?,"The correct answer is **C: Jack Layton**.

The passage states that Jack Layton requested changes to the ""Clean Air Act"" during a meeting with the Prime Minister.
"
Ke mang yo o neng a ganetsa gore ‘Molao wa Phefo e e Phepa’ o ne o dirisiwa jaaka motshameko wa pele ga ditlhopho?,"The answer is **D: Mopalamente**.

The passage states that ""puso le mapalamente mangwe ba kgadile se, ba bua fa e le setshosa fela, ka jaana ba lebile ditlhopho tse di tla tshwarwang ka Ngwanatsele."" This translates to ""the government and some members of parliament criticized this, saying it was just a scare tactic, as they are looking at the elections to be held in November."" This implies that members of parliament believe the government's actions are politically motivated in anticipation of the elections. While it's the Australian government and the Mersey hospital action being discussed here, the structure of the statements give the answer.
"
Dikhemikale tsa cyanuric acid le melamine di ne tsa bopiwa ke eng fa di ne di dirisana mmogo mo motlhapeng wa katse?,"Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **C: Dikhiristale**.

"
Babatlisisi ba ne ba dirisa thekenoloji ya infrared spectroscopy go bona eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Seelo sa dikhiristale mo motlhapeng wa diphologolo**.

The passage states that researchers used infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to compare the structure of crystals formed in the urine of cats exposed to melamine and cyanuric acid with the structure of crystals found in the kidneys of the affected animals. This comparison helped them understand the link between the two.
"
"""Ke mang yo o neng a bitsa Luna a re ke """"Mohumagadi wa ntlha  yo o Feteletseng""""?""","The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

"
"""Ke mang yo o neng a bitsa Luna a re o  """"popota""""?""","The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The passage clearly states ""Mme, mokgweetsi o ne a bona dikgobalo tse di masisi mo tlhogong."" (But the driver sustained serious head injuries.)
"
Ke eng se se neng se sa tlhomologe mo motshamekong wa Afrika Borwa wa motshameko wa rugby?,"The passage states the following factors made South Africa stand out:

*   Good defensive play (go itshwara sentle ga basireletsi)
*   Skillful ball handling (kitso ya go tshwara bolo ka matsetseleko)
*   Good teamwork (go dirisana sentle ga batshameki)
* Started well with an easy win. (Ba simolotse sentle ba bona phenyo motlhofo ya 26 - 00 kgatlhanong le maemo a botlhano a gapilweng ke Zambia)

Therefore, all the options are correct, but since the question is asking ""what stood out"", teamwork, ball handling and defense are better answer.

**A: Tiro e e kgatlhang ya setlhopha** is the best answer because the passage says ""go dirisana sentle ga batshameki"" which translates to good teamwork, contributed to the team standing out. This encompasses a broader aspect of their performance compared to just defense or ball handling.

**B: Kitso ya go tshwara bolo ka matsetseleko.** is also one of the factor that stood out.

**C: Ba simolotse sentle, ba fenya motlhofo.** also explains how south africa team stood out.

**D: Bokgoni jwa go itshireletsa.** also explains how south africa team stood out.

Considering the options and the context, while all the options are mentioned in the text, **A** is the most comprehensive and directly linked to the team standing out.

"Go ya ka serapa, motshameko wa Afrika Borwa o simolotse leng go tokafala?","The correct answer is **D: Fa kgaisano e ntse e tsweletse (Fa motshameko o ntse o tsweletse)**

The paragraph states: ""...Aforika Borwa, ene ya tokafala fa motshameko o ntse o tsweletse."" which translates to ""South Africa, improved as the game progressed.""
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mafoko afe a a latelang a a sa bontsheng sentle gore itsholelo ya China e ntse jang?","The correct answer is **D: China ga e ise e ko e romele dikoloi di le dintsi go feta Jeremane**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Itsholelo ya China e ile ya gola ka bofefo morago ga go dirwa diphetogo** - This is clearly stated, the paragraph mentions economic reforms under Deng Xiaoping and subsequent growth.
*   **B: China e na le mmaraka o mogolo wa go romela ntle dikoloi go feta United States** - This is stated directly in the paragraph: ""...e bo e feta Amerika ka go nna mmaraka o motona wa kgwebo e.""
*   **C: Kgabagare China e ka nna ya nna le selekanyetso sa itsholelo sa GDP se se fetang sa United States** - This is also stated: ""GDP ya China e ka nna ya feta ya Amerika mo dingwageng tse di masome a mabedi tse di tlang.""
*   **D: China ga e ise e ko e romele dikoloi di le dintsi go feta Jeremane** - The paragraph clearly states that ""ngwaga o o fetileng China e rekiseditse mafatshe a sele dikoloi tse dintsi go feta Jeremane..."" which directly contradicts statement D.
Therefore, D is incorrect."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke leng GDP ya China e ka fetang ya United States?","The best answer is **B: Mo masomeng a mabedi a dingwaga**.

The passage explicitly states: ""GDP ya China e ka nna ya feta ya Amerika mo dingwageng tse di masome a mabedi tse di tlang.""
"
Hu o ne a akantsha gore dinaga tse di tlhabologang di dire eng?,"The correct answer is **D: Go tila ditsela tsa bogologolo tsa kgotlelo** (To avoid old ways of pollution).

The passage explicitly states: ""Hu o ile a rotloetsa dinaga tse di santseng di tlhabologa """"go emisa mokgwa wa bogologolo wa go kgotlhela pele mme go phepafadiwe morago."""""" This translates to ""Hu encouraged developing countries to stop the old way of polluting first and cleaning up later.""
"
Ke eng se Hu a neng a sa se umaka?,"The correct answer is **D: Palo ya dipalopalo tsa go fokotsa go ntshiwa ga khabone**

Here's why:

*   **P states:** ""O ne a se ke a bua selekanyo sa go re ba tla kgaola ka bokae, a bua fela go ra selekanyo sa teng se tla laolwa ke mabaka a itsholelo a lefatshe la Chaena."" This translates to ""He did not mention by how much they would cut, he only said that the amount would be determined by the economic factors of China.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly states that Hu did *not* mention the *specific amount* of carbon emission reduction."
Veerman o ne a re boemo ga bo a siama mo go efe ya dilo tse di latelang?,"The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

The passage explicitly states that Veerman said the situation is worsening in **Angola**.
"
"Ka ntlha ya tatofatso, ke mang yo o tla tsayang maemo a ga Huhne mo Kabineteng?","The correct answer is **A: Davey**.

The passage states: ""Huhne o rotse tiro mme o tla emisediwa ke Ed Davey MP mo Kabineteng."" This directly answers the question of who will take Huhne's position.
"
Ke mang yo o tla nnang Tona ya Kgwebo morago ga go sekisiwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Lamb**.

The passage states ""Norman Lamb MP o lebeletswe go re a tseye tiro ya Tona ya tsa Kgwebo e Davey a e tlogelang."" This directly indicates that Lamb is expected to take over the role.
"
Batshameki ba rotloetsa bareetsi go dira eng ka nako ya opera ya ga Camille Saint-Saens?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is:

**A: Nna le seabe mo go gogeng cannabis.**

The passage states that the performers encourage the audience to participate in smoking cannabis.
"
Ke mang yo gantsi a gogang disekerete ka nako ya opera?,"The correct answer is **C: Badiragatsi**.

The passage states ""badiragatsi ba goga cannabis mo seraleng"", so ""badiragatsi"" is the most accurate answer.
"
"""Leina le lengwe la """"spacewalk"""" e Leonov a neng a e dira ke lefe?""","The correct answer is **C: Go tsamaya mo lefaufaung, a le kwa ntle ga sesutlhalefaufau.**

The passage explicitly states that Leonov's first spacewalk was also known as """"go tsamaya mo lefaufaung"""", a le kwa ntle ga sesutlhalefaufau"".
"
Leonov o ne a eteletse pele karolo ya Soviet ya thomo efe?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**.

The passage states: ""Dingwaga di le lesome moragonyana, o ne a etelela pele setlhopha sa Soviet sa Apollo–letsholo la Soyuz...""
"
Ke mang yo o neng a gobala mo kotsing?,"The correct answer is **A: Gibson**.

The passage states, ""Gibson one a sianisetswa kwa kokelong morago ga kotsi, mme one a tlokafafala fa a sena go fitlha mo boekelong."" which translates to ""Gibson was rushed to the hospital after the accident, but he died after arriving at the hospital."" This clearly indicates that Gibson was injured in the accident.
"
Go ne ga direga eng ka batho ba ba neng ba amega mo kotsing eo?,"The correct answer is **B: Yo mongwe o ne a sa gobala, yo mongwe o ne a swa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Mokgweetsi wa dilori... o ne a seka a gobala mo kotsing"" (The truck driver... was not injured in the accident).
*   It also states: ""Gibson one a sianisetswa kwa kokelong morago ga kotsi, mme one a tlokafafala"" (Gibson was rushed to the hospital after the accident, but he died).
*   The children are described as being at the scene, but there is nothing in the text that indicates they were injured.

Therefore, one person was uninjured, and one person died.
"
Baitsesaense ba ba neng ba dira ka thulaganyo eno ba ne ba solofetse go bona ditlamorago tse di bakwang ke dife tsa dilo tse di latelang?,"The correct answer is **D: Dilo tse di lefifi**.

The passage states: ""Maduo a setlhopha se neng se a solofetse a ka dirwa ke makhubu a magolo thata magareng ga bosagaripa jo bontsho mo loaping le losagaripa lo lo lefifi lwa molalatladi."" This directly indicates the scientists expected to see effects caused by the interaction between black holes and dark matter.
"
Baitsesaense ba ne ba ela tlhoko kgang efe ya dilo tse di latelang?,"The passage states: ""Fela jaaka ngwedi o na le kgatelelo mo lefatsheng, o dira makhubu, Milky Way le yone e dira kgatelelo kwa lesagareng la dinaleldi la Sagittarius."" This means the scientists are observing the interaction between the Milky Way (Molala wa Tladi) and the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (lesagaripa la dinaledi la Sagittarius).

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Losagaripa lwa Sagittarius le Molala wa Tladi**.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se batho ba ba sa rateng go fetoga ga polotiki ba sa se kgaleng?","The correct answer is **C: Ba ba abelwang dikonteraka tsa kago seša**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kgakololo e e phuthulogileng e remeletse thata mo go matswela a borra dikonteraka go re e bonwe ke baagi ba Washington."" This translates to: ""Open criticism has focused on the contractors' profits being seen by Washington residents.""

This means the criticism (or disapproval from those ""who don't like political change"") is directed at the profits contractors are making. Awarding the contracts (option C) is the action that leads to those profits, and therefore the target of disapproval. The passage doesn't directly criticize the aid money (A), the lack of rebuilding efforts (B), or the rebuilding costs (D), but rather the potential for contractors to profit excessively.
"
Ke mang yo o tshwayang dikonteraka tsa go tsosolosa tiro ya go namola ba ba amilweng ke Setsuatsue sa Katrina diphoso?,"The answer is **D: Batho ba ba mo teng ga Washington**.

The passage states that the open criticism focused on the profits contractors were making, ""to be seen by those in Washington."" This implies that people within Washington are the ones scrutinizing the contracts and their results.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, dipone tsa sekepe sa Stardust di tla bonala kae pele?","The correct answer is **B: Bokone jwa California**.

The text states: ""Se se ka tsamaela kwa ditshitshing tsa bophirima jwa bokone jwa California e bile se tla phatshimisa loapi go tswa California..."" This indicates the lights will be visible first in northern California.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, sejanaga seno sa lefaufau se tla tlhoma rekoto ya eng mo go tse di latelang?","The correct answer is C: Go boela mo Lefatsheng ka bonako.

The paragraph states that Stardust will set a new, brief record for the fastest return of a spacecraft to Earth.
"
Go ne go ntse jang Dr. A Malar Balasubramanian o amana le Saroja Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **C: Mmè**

The passage states ""Ngaka Malar Balasubramanian yo o dingwaga tse 29...o fitlhetswe...Gone fale, ba bone mmele wa ga Saroja Balsubramniam, 53""

Therefore, Saroja Balasubramanian is the mother of Dr. Malar Balasubramanian."
Mmele wa ga Sara Balasubramanian o ne wa fitlhelwa kae?,"The correct answer is **C: Mo teng ga koloi**.

The text says: ""Gone fale, ba bone mmele wa ga Saroja Balsubramniam, 53 o apesitswe ka kobo e e nang le dikolo tsa madi."" The phrase ""Gone fale"" refers to the black Oldsmobile Intrigue, meaning her body was found inside the car.
"
eBay e ne ya reka eng?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

The passage states that the company (eBay) hopes to become more visible in areas where Skype holds a strong position. This implies eBay acquired Skype.
"
eBay e batla go fitlhelela eng ka go reka?,"The correct answer is a combination of options:

*   **A: Go nonotsha lotseno lwa yone (To strengthen its revenue)** - The passage states that the company hopes to have diversified revenue streams, indicating a desire to strengthen revenue.
*   **B: Go atolosa kwa re nang le kemedi teng (To expand where it has a presence)** - The passage explicitly mentions expanding its presence in regions where Skype has a strong foothold, like China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil.
*   **C: Dira gore e bonwe ke batho (Make it visible to people)** - The passage mentions making it more known where Skype is strong, indirectly aiming to increase visibility.

While D might be a general goal of any company, it's not directly mentioned in the passage.

Therefore, the best answer is a combination of A, B, and C. However, if I must choose only one of these then **B: Go atolosa kwa re nang le kemedi teng** is the most accurate as it is explicitly stated in the passage."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mang yo o neng a sa kopane le magolegwa a a neng a sala mo jarateng morago ga ntwa?","Karabo e nepagetseng ke **A: Babueledi**.

Ke eng mo go tse di latelang se kgabagare se neng sa dira gore magolegwa a boele morago mo dikhuduegong?,"The correct answer is **B: Gase e e gogelang**.

The passage states that police equipped with riot gear entered the yard and showered the inmates with tear gas. This directly led to the inmates being subdued. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dipuisano Tse di Atlegileng:** The passage explicitly states that negotiations were unsuccessful.
*   **C: Magolegwa a mangwe a a gobetseng:** While injuries occurred, they are presented as a preceding event that did not stop the riot.
*   **D: Molelo:** The fire was started *by* the prisoners, not something that ended the riot on its own. While it probably contributed to the decision to use tear gas, the gas itself is what directly caused the prisoners to comply."
"Go ya ka pono ya ga Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, naga ya Iran e tshwanetse go gololesega mo go eng?","The correct answer is **D: Go ikaega ka oli (Go ikaega ka leokwaneng)**

The passage states: ""Moeteledipele yo mogolo wa naga, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, o tlhalositse gore go ikaega thata ka leokwaneng ke ”serai” sa pele ga phetogo ya Iselamo ya Iran ka 1979 le se naga e tshwanetseng ya ikgolola mo go sone."" This directly translates to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stating that the dependence on oil is something Iran should free itself from.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mang yo o neng a dumela gore kgaosetso-dipapadisanyo e ama itsholelo ya Iran?","The correct answer is **A: Metswedi e megolo**.

The passage states: ""Dikakgelo, tse di neng di supiwa mo thelebisheneng, e ne e e la ntlha bagolo ba Irana ba bua ba dumela go re makgamu a na le ditlamorago.""

This means the media reported that Iranian officials acknowledged the sanctions have an impact. ""Metswedi e megolo"" is the best translation for media sources.
"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e sa akarediweng mo thulaganyong ya go bouta ya Fora?,"The correct answer is **D: Diboutu tse di balwang ke baemedi ba ba tlhophilweng**.

The passage states that votes are counted by ""baithaopi ka fa tlase ga taolo e gagametseng"" (volunteers under strict control), not by ""baemedi ba ba tlhophilweng"" (elected representatives). The other options are explicitly mentioned in the passage.
"
Batlhophi ba supa kae motho yo ba mo tlhophileng?,"The correct answer is **B: Mo pampiring e e gatisitsweng pele**.

The passage states: ""batlhophi ba itlhaolela mo matlhopelong, e bo ba tshwaye pampitshana e e nna le ntlhopheng yo ba mmatlang, e bo ba e tsenye ba gare ga pampitshana e nngwe"". This clearly indicates they mark a pre-printed paper (pampitshana) with their chosen candidate.
"
Ke eng se se neng sa dira gore Allen a simolole go batla Musashi ka dingwaga di le robedi?,"The correct answer is **D: Kgatlhego ya gagwe mo ntweng**.

The passage states that Allen started his search for the Musashi ""go tswa mo kgatlhegong ya gagwe ya kgale ya ntwa"".
"
"Go ya ka serapa, Allen o ne a dirisa madi a mantsi a gagwe mo go eng?","The best answer is **B: Dipatlisiso tsa lewatle**

Here's why:

*   The paragraph states Allen ""beeleditse bontsi jwa madi a gagwe mo ditlhotlhomisong tsa ka fa tlase ga metsi"". This translates directly to underwater or marine research.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   A: Go batla Musashi go tswa mo kgatlhegong ya gagwe ya kgale ya ntwa. - This is part of the reason why he was interested in dipatlisiso tsa lewatle, but dipatlisiso tsa lewatle is the broader category.
*   C: Go aga ROV - While ROVs were used, the paragraph doesn't say he spent a large portion of his money on building them.
*   D: Go ithuta ka go dira dimmapa tsa boalo jwa lewatle - Map of the sea floor was done during dipatlisiso tsa lewatle, but it's not necessarily what the majority of his money was spent on."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke sefe sa dilo tse di latelang se se ka tswang se ile sa dira gore go nne le maemo a a kotsi mo setlhareng le mo tikologong ya sone?","The correct answer is **A: Leokwane la yuraniamo.**

Here's why:

*   The paragraph states ""balaodi ba fopholetsa gore seno se bontsha gore ditanka tse di tsentseng leokwane la yuraniamo mo lefelong di ka tswa di phatlogile mme di a dutla""

The other options are mentioned, but the passage explicitly connects leaking uranium fuel with the potentially dangerous situation."

The passage explicitly states that NextGen uses satellite-based technology.
"
Baokamedi ba dipalangwa tsa difofane ba solegelwa molemo jang ke NextGen ka tlhamalalo?,"The correct answer is **B: Go supa kwa difofane di leng teng ka nepo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that NextGen allows air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft locations with greater accuracy. This is the most direct benefit for air traffic controllers.

The other options are benefits that are either more general or indirect:

*   A: Go fofa sekgala se sennye (Shorter flight paths) - This is a result of NextGen, but not a direct benefit for controllers.
*   C: Go fokotsa mosi o o kgotlelang (Reducing polluting emissions) - A general environmental benefit.
*   D: Di somarele dimilione tsa dilithara tsa leokwane (Saving millions of liters of fuel) - Another general economic and environmental benefit."
"Go ya ka serapa, bakwadi ba hisitori ga ba a ka ba tshwaya phoso FBI ka go bo e ne e tlhomile mogopolo mo go eng?","The correct answer is **B: Go abela bokebekwa jo bo ka rarabololwang motlhofo madi.**

The passage states that the critics condemned the FBI's earlier practice of focusing resources on cases that are easy to solve, particularly car theft cases, in an effort to increase the organization's success rate.  This is equivalent to allocating resources to easily solvable crimes.
"
Letsholo la go thibela boitsholo jo bo maswe le pateletsa FBI go dira eng?,"The correct answer is **C: Tlhoma mogopolo mo bokebekweng jo bo tshwanetseng go rarabololwa motlhofo.**

Here's why:

* **Premise P** states the FBI was criticized for focusing on *easy* cases (like stolen cars) to improve their success rate.
* **Premise Q** shows that congress wants FBI to focus on observing cyber crimes.
* Since easy cases were being focused on to increase the agency's success rate, now congress is pressuring them to focus on cyber crimes. The best answer is C.

Ke mafoko afe a a latelang a a sa bontsheng sentle gore Bobek o ne a dira tiro ya gagwe le Partizan Belgrade?,"The correct answer is **A: O ne a fitlhelela dino di feta 468 fa a ne a tshamekela setlhopha seno**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""he managed to score 403 goals in 468 games"". Option A says he *achieved* more than 468 goals in his appearances.

The other options explicitly show his impact and achievements with Partizan Belgrade."
Ke mafoko afe a a boammaaruri ka ditso tsa ga Bobek le Partizan Belgrade?,"The correct answers are **A** and **B**.

*   **A: O ne a simolola go tshamekela Partizan ka 1945** - This is directly stated in the passage: ""O ne a ikgolaganya le bone ka 1945 a bo a nna go fitlha ka 1958.""
*   **B: O ne a tshamekela Zagreb pele ga Partizan Belgrade** - This is implied by the first sentence: ""Bobek, o a tsholetsweng kwa motsemoshate wa Croatia o o bidiwang Zagreb..."" It says he was born in Zagreb, implying he likely played there before joining Partizan Belgrade, which is in Belgrade.

*   **C: O ne a tshamekela Partizan go fitlha ka 1995** - This is incorrect. The passage states he stayed with Partizan until 1958, not 1995.
*   **D: O ne a tuma fa a sena go tlhophiwa jaaka motshameki yo o gaisang wa Partizan** - This is incorrect. The passage says he became famous *while* playing for Partizan, not after being chosen as the best player. The award came in 1995, long after his playing career."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke nonofo efe e e farologanyang Hesperonychus le Velociraptor?","The correct answer is **B: E na le lenala le legolo la bobedi**.

The passage states that the large second claw led to the name *Hesperonychus*, implying it was a distinctive feature. While it also mentions both species have claws like *Velociraptor* the large size of Hesperonychus' claw is what sets it apart. The other options are traits shared or generally assumed.
"
"""Bokao jwa leina la """"Hesperonychus"""" bo tswa mo selong sefe sa mofuta ono?""","The correct answer is **C: Maoto**.

The passage states that the name ""Hesperonychus"" refers to the ""lenala la letlhakore la bophirima tsatsi"", which is a claw on its foot. Therefore, the name relates to its **maoto** (feet).
"
Ke mafoko afe a a boammaaruri mo go a a latelang malebana le go thuntshiwa?,"The correct answer is **D: Go thuntshiwa go diragetse kwa Buffalo** (The shooting happened in Buffalo).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the couple came to Buffalo to celebrate with friends and family, and that the 30-year-old man killed was born in Buffalo. The passage also mentions that the man killed in the shooting was born in Buffalo. Therefore, the shooting occurred in Buffalo.
*   **A** is incorrect because the couple got married in Texas.
*   **B** is incorrect because the passage says 4 people were killed.
*   **C** is incorrect because the couple was married in Texas, not Buffalo."
Ke polelo efe e e boammaaruri malebana le tiragalo e go thuntshitsweng mo go yone?,"Based on the text, the correct answer is **A: Go ne ga diragala kwa moletlong wa segopotso kwa Buffalo**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that the couple was celebrating their first wedding anniversary in Buffalo with friends and family.
*   It also says that a shooting occurred and a 30-year-old man from Buffalo was killed.

Therefore, the shooting happened at the anniversary celebration in Buffalo."
"Go ya ka serapa, badiredibagolo ba ne ba tshwenyegile ka eng fa ba utlwa ka Luno?","The correct answer is **C: Go dutla ga lookwane (The leaking of oil)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""kwa tshimologong batshwara marapo ba ne ba tshogela go re sekepe se ka tsholola morwalo"" which translates to ""initially the stakeholders feared that the ship might spill its cargo"". Since the cargo was oil (""leokwane la dikubi""), the primary concern was an oil spill.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mafoko afe a a latelang a a malebana le go tlhatlhamololwa ga Luno a a seng boammaaruri?","The correct answer is **B: Sekepe se ne se na le dimetara di le 100 tsa lookwane fa se ne se senyega**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Luno was carrying *between* 120 and 160 cubic meters of oil when it broke down. Thus, claiming it had exactly 100 cubic meters is incorrect according to the passage.
*   The passage states the boat was pushed into walls built to protect against large waves, not mud. Therefore, choice D is not correct.

The other options are supported by the passage:

*   A: The boat was on it's way to pick up the oil *after* the boat broke down.
*   C: This is stated verbatim in the passage."
Algeria e ne ya nna naga e e ikemetseng ka ngwaga ofe?,"The passage states that Vautier returned to Algeria in the 1960s.  Since he was teaching filmmaking *after* Algeria became independent, the answer must be C: Mo dingwageng tsa bo 1960.
"
Ke kae koo go neng go se na dithelebišene gone mo phitlhong?,"The passage states that televisions were set up in various locations around Rome to allow people to view the ceremony. It also indicates that the crowd at St. Peter's Square was too large to accommodate everyone. Therefore, televisions were **not** needed *inside* St. Peter's Square.

The correct answer is **D: Kwa St. Peter's Square**.
"
Tirelo ya phitlho e ne e tshwaretswe kae?,"The correct answer is **C: Kwa St. Peter’s Square**.

The passage states ""...batho ba ne ba le bantsi thata mo e leng go re go go sa kgonagale go re mongwe le mongwe a letlelelwe go ka tsena kwa phitlhong kwa St. Peter's Square."" This clearly indicates the funeral service was held at St. Peter's Square.
"
"Morago ga go thunya, ke mang yo o neng a alafelwa dikgobalo tse di masisi?","The correct answer is **B: Ope**.

The passage states that the five people present were treated for *shock*, not serious injuries. It also explicitly says ""Go ne go sena ope mo ntlong eo"" (There was no one in the house).
"
Ke mang yo o neng a bega ka go dutla ga gase?,"The correct answer is **A: Moagisane mo kagong.**

The passage states: ""Tlhobolo ya ga Uka e ile sa tlholwa fa se santse se supile tlhogo ya monna wa botlhano."" This translates to ""Uka's gun was recovered while it was still pointing towards the head of the fifth man.""
"
Ke mofuta ofe wa metshameko o o neng wa tlosiwa mo thulaganyong ya Diolimpiki?,"The correct answer is **C: Baseball**.

The passage states that ""baseball and softball... [were] removed from the Olympic games in 2005.""
"
Ke mofuta ofe wa metshameko e e latelang o Komiti ya Boditšhabatšhaba ya Diolimpiki e neng ya tlhopha gore o akarediwe mo metshamekong eno?,"The correct answer is **C: Yunione ya Rugby**.

The passage states ""Rugby, segolo yunione ya rugby, le golf di ile tsa tlhophiwa go na le metshameko e mengwe e le metlhano go re e akanyediwe go tsaya karolo mo Diolimpiking."" This clearly indicates that rugby union was chosen.
"
Kwa tshimologong Arthur Guinness o ne a hira St James' Gate Brewery ka dingwaga tse kae?,"The correct answer is **D: 9000**

The passage states that Arthur Guinness signed a 9,000-year lease for St James' Gate Brewery.
"
Guinness e dira diranta di le dibilione di le kae ka ngwaga?,"The correct answer is **C: Di-euro di le lesome (US$14.7 billion)**.

The passage states that Guinness makes ""madi a a fetang dibilione tsa di-euro di le lesome (US$14.7 billion)"" annually.
"
Go lemogilwe mogare wa H5N1 mo dinageng di le kae tsa European Union?,"The correct answer is **C: Bosupa**.

The passage states that France is the seventh country in the European Union to be affected by the H5N1 virus.
"
Motho wa bofelo yo o neng a tshwaeditswe ke mogare wa H5N1 o ne a bonwa kae?,"The correct answer is **A: Fora (France)**.

The passage states that H5N1 was confirmed in a dead wild duck near Lyon, in eastern France. This implies that the virus was recently found in France. The other countries are listed as having previous cases, but the most recent confirmed case mentioned in the passage is in France.
"
Haiti e ne ya kopana leng la bofelo le bolwetse jono pele ga bo anama ka ntlha ya badisa ba kagiso?,"The correct answer is **A: Dingwaga tsa bo-1800.**

The passage states: ""Pele ga kgorogo ya masole, Haiti e ne e ise e itemogele mathata a a malebana le bolwetse ga e sale ka dingwaga tsa bo-1800.""
"
Ke matlakala a a tswang kwa lefelong lefe a a neng a baka go anama ga bolwetse jono?,"The correct answer is **B: Kampa ya Lekgotla la Dichaba tse di Kopaneng**.

The passage states that the cholera outbreak started near the UN peacekeeping troop camp and that improperly disposed waste from the UN camp introduced bacteria into the Artibonite River.
"
Puso ya Ireland e ikaeletse go dira eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Go tlhama molao ka bonako jo bo kgonegang mabapi le batho ba ba dirang tlolomolao ya diritibatsi**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the government wants to ""gatelela go potlaka ga melao ya palamente go baakanya seemo"" (emphasize the urgency of parliamentary laws to fix the situation).
* It specifically mentions ""tshiamiso ya bokebekwa"" (criminal justice) which is directly related to people who commit drug-related crimes.
* The text says the government lawyer believes the law must be drafted as quickly as possible for both public health and criminal justice concerns

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B:** The passage indicates the opposite of stricter drug laws are now in place.
* **C:** The passage states that people are abusing the drug law and that there is an aim to resolve the situation with drug laws.
* **D:** The passage doesn't explicitly state that the government wants to remove drug laws, just that there is a need to fix the situation and amend laws relating to people who commit drug-related crimes.
"
Ke eng se se neng se letleletswe semolao ka nakwana kwa Ireland?,"The correct answer is **D: Diokobatsi**.

The passage states: ""... batho botlhe ba bona kgololosego ya tiriso ya melemo e e mo molaong jaaka tshono..."" which translates to ""...everyone sees the freedom to use legal drugs as an opportunity...""  This implies that the use of certain drugs has been legalized, at least temporarily.
"
Motho yo go belaelwang gore o dirile molato o batlisisiwa ka eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Go Tsena a se na tetla**

The passage states: ""go dirwa dipatlisiso mo rre wa mmelaelwa go wa go dira molato go tsena mo lefelong la mong a sena tetla e seng wa go senyaka"". This clearly indicates the investigation is about trespassing (go tsena mo lefelong la mong a sena tetla).
"
"Fa motho yo o belaelwang a ne a fetola letshwao, o ne a se ka a dira eng?","The passage states that the suspect:

1.  Used black tarpaulin decorated with peace and heart symbols.
2.  Changed the letter ""O"" to a lowercase ""e"".

The question asks what the suspect *didn't* do.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Fetola nngwe ya ditlhaka tsa yone** (Change one of its letters): He did this (O to e).
*   **B: E kgabise ka tshupo ya kagiso** (Decorate it with a peace symbol): He did this.
*   **C: Go e senya mo mmeleng** (Physically damage it): The passage says the sign wasn't badly damaged. This is the correct answer.
*   **D: Dirisa thapoline e ntsho go e fetola.** (Use black tarpaulin to change it.): He did this.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C**.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, morutabana wa Seesemane e bong Karno o ne a sa latofadiwe ka eng mo go tse di latelang?","The correct answer is **B: A ntse fela jaaka tsala mo baithuting.**

The paragraph states that a former student described Karno as being ""like a friend"" to the students. This is a description, not an accusation. The other options are directly stated as accusations made against him:

*   **A: Go ne go na le dipego tsa gore o dirisa ditlhapa fa a ruta.** (There were reports he used swear words while teaching) - Directly stated in the paragraph.
*   **C: Go gatisa dipapatso tse di sa letlelelwang.** (Printing unauthorized advertisements) - The ""Ba thuto ya sesha"" accused him of this.
*   **D: Go dirisa puo e e leswe mo phaposing** (Using obscene language in the classroom) - This is related to using swear words, as indicated in option A. A former student said that he uses Tsotsi taal."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mang yo o neng a sa tsewa e le motshwarwa ke Rolando Mendoza?","The correct answer is **B: Lepodisi**.

The passage states that ""Ba tsayadinepe ba ma-Phillipines"" were taken hostage. It also mentions that ""Batshwarwakananyo ba le barataro, go akaretsa bana le bagolo,"" were released, implying that children (bana) were among the hostages. It is very clear that the tourists (bajanala) were hostages. Therefore, a police officer was not taken hostage and in fact, engaged the hostage taker, Mendoza."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke batshwarwa bafe ba go neng go sa tlhomamisiwa gore ba tla gololwa pele ga nako?","The correct answer is **A: Bajanala**

The passage states that six hostages, including children and elderly, and also Filipino photographers were released early. It doesn't mention any certainty about the release of the tourists.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mang yo o kokoanyang mesaeno ya go tshegetsa go letlelelwa ga manyalo a batho ba bong jo bo tshwanang kwa Brazil?","The correct answer is **A: Badiraditshupetso**.

The passage states that ""Badiraditshupetso ba solofela go amogela kopo ya mesaeno e le sedikadike tse 1, 2 go e isa kwa Lekgotla kgolo la sechaba ka Ngwanatsele."" This clearly indicates that the demonstrators are the ones collecting the signatures.
"
Batlhabanelatumelo ba tla naya mang kopo ya bone?,"The correct answer is **C: Palamente ya Brazil** (Parliament of Brazil).

The passage states that the protestors hope to deliver a petition with 1.2 million signatures to the National Congress (Lekgotla kgolo la sechaba), which is the Parliament of Brazil.
"
"Go ya ka pego ya ga Armand Versace, go ne ga direga eng pele ga boidiidi bo simolola go tsibogela maemo a bosa?","The correct answer is **C: Phefo di tsamaya mo go 70km/oura.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Metsotso ele thano mo tshopegetsong diphefo di a simolola, motsotso o latelang, phefo di tsamaya mo go 70km/oura… go tswa foo pula ya simologa, ka bokete jo bo betsang letlalo ekete nnale, e bo e simologa go na ka sehako, batho e bo ba simolola go tshoga...""
*   This shows that after the winds started, they reached 70km/hour, and *then* the people started panicking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E bo e simolola go na ka sehako.** The hail started *after* the wind and rain, which were the events that directly led to the people's panic.
*   **B: Metsotso e le metlhano mo tshopegetsong.** While this is the very start of the events, the question asks about *before* the panic.
*   **D: O ne a latlhegelwa ke kgaitsadie.** This is a consequence of the event, not something that happened before the panic."
"Go ya ka Versace, diphefo tse di maatla di ne tsa simolola leng?","The correct answer is **A: Metsotso e sekae morago ga gore pontsho e simolole.**

The passage states: ""Metsotso ele thano mo tshopegetsong diphefo di a simolola..."" This translates to ""Five minutes into the show the winds start..."".  ""Five minutes into the show"" means ""a few minutes after the show started"".
"
"Pele ga Fred, go ne go na le ditsuatsue di le kae tse dikgolo tse di neng di begilwe kwa botlhaba jwa 35°W?","Based on the provided text:

The text states that Fred is the ""third cyclone ever observed so far east in the Atlantic, since satellite imagery began; and the third to form east of the 35°W meridian.""

Therefore, before Fred, there were *two* cyclones observed east of the 35°W meridian.

The correct answer is **C: Tse pedi**
"
"Fa Fred a ne a le gaufi le ditlhaketlhake tsa Cape Verde, o ne a ya ntlheng efe?","The correct answer is **D: Bokone-bophirima** because the passage states that ""Fred mo nakong ya gompieno o na le diphefo tsa selekanyo sa lebelo la dimaele di le 105 ka oura (165km/h) mme o tsamaela ma ntlheng a bokone-bophirima.""
"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e nang le lobelo lo lo kwa godimo go feta tse di tlileng pele ga yone?,"Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **A: 802.11n**.

Polelo e supa gore 802.11n e na le lobelo lo lo kwa godimo go feta mefuta ya 802.11a, 802.11b, le 802.11g. E bile e bolela gore lobelo lwa yone lo menagane go feta tsa pele, ka keketso ya 600Mbit/s.
"
Ke eng se se tlhokegang gore 802.11n e dirisanye le 802.11b?,"The correct answer is **D: Dual radios.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Se se e letla go re e kgone go dirisanya le tse di dirilweng pele tsa 802.11a, 802.11b le 802.11g - mme go laolwa fela ke go re go dirisiwa mafaratlhatlha a dual radios."" This directly links interoperability with older standards (like 802.11b) to the use of dual radios.

Let's look at the other options:

*   A: Lobelo la 2.4Ghz le la 5.0Ghz. (The 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz bands.) While 802.11n uses both bands, the passage states interoperability depends on dual radios, not just the presence of both bands.
*   B: Bokgoni jwa 802.11b jwa go dira ka 5.0Ghz. (802.11b's ability to operate at 5.0Ghz.) 802.11b does not operate at 5.0Ghz.
*   C: Kekelo ya 600Mbit/s. (An increase of 600Mbit/s.) This is a characteristic of 802.11n's speed, not a requirement for interoperability.

Mofenyi wa metale wa gouta wa Diolimpiki o ne a tshwanetse go thuma mo metshamekong e le kae kwa Metshamekong ya Mafatshe a Selekane?,"Kgang e re bolelela gore mogapi yoo wa seetsele sa gouta wa di-Olimpiki o ne a tshwanetse go thuma mo freestyle ya dimetara tse 100 le tse 200 le mo mabelong a mararo a neeletsano. Fa re balela, re bona gore o ne a tshwanetse go thuma mo ditiragalong tse 2 tsa freestyle + ditiragalo tse 3 tsa neeletsano = ditiragalo tse 5.

Ke ka ntlha yang fa mmampodi wa metale wa gouta wa Diolimpiki a ne a sa tseye melemo ya ditlhabi tsa gagwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Ntse a sa kgone go tsaya diokobatsi tse a di tlhokang gore a okobatse matlhaba,ka di sa letlelelwa mo metshamekong.**

The passage explicitly states that he couldn't take his medication because it was banned at the games.
"
"Go ya ka temana e, ke eng se se ka tswang se ile sa dira gore go nne le tlhakatlhakano malebang le tiragalo ya dithoromo tsa lefatshe?","The correct answer is **A: Go nna gone ga maru a ntshontsho.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Maru a ntshontsho a a sa amaneng ka gope le tiragalo ya lekgwamolelo go ne ga begiwa fa a bonetse ka fa tlase ga thaba. Maru a tlisitse kgonagalo ya tsietsego ya go re a mme tota lekgwamolelo le diragetse."" This directly indicates that the black clouds caused confusion about whether a volcanic eruption was occurring. While the earthquake information is also relevant, the question specifically asks about what caused *confusion*. The clouds were the direct cause of that confusion.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, go ne ga direga leng gore go nne le phetogo e kgolo?","The correct answer is **A: Ka Mopitlo a le 10.**

The paragraph states: ""Thoromo ya lefatshe e e tseneletseng, e e neng ya fetola seemo kwa letlhakoreng la bokone-botlhaba jwa mosima o o kwa godimo ga lekgwamolelo e diragetse ka Mopitlo a le 10."" (A deep earthquake, which changed the situation on the northeastern side of the crater at the top of the volcano, occurred on March 10.)
"
"Ke mafoko afe a a latelang, a a malebana le sedirisiwa sa Chandrayaan-1, a a sa siamang?","The correct answer is **A: Sekepe se se neng sa e romela se ne se na le batho ba se neng se tsamaya le bone.**

Here's why:

*   **P** describes Chandrayaan-1's Moon Impact Probe (MIP). Lunar orbiters such as Chandrayaan-1 are unmanned, meaning they don't carry astronauts, so statement **A** is incorrect.
*   **B: Se ne se na le didirisiwa tse di botlhokwa.** Is incorrect, as P indicates that Chandrayaan-1's Moon Impact Probe did carry valuable scientific equipment.
*   **C: Go ntshiwa ga sedirisiwa seno go ne ga atlega.** Is incorrect, as P states that the deployment of Chandrayaan-1's Moon Impact Probe was successful.
*   **D: Se ne se na le matlhakore a a pentilweng.** Is incorrect, as P says Chandrayaan-1's Moon Impact Probe had an image of the Indian flag painted on all sides."
"Ke mafoko afe mo go a a latelang, a a tlhalosang sentle se se neng sa dirwa ke sedirisiwa sa go tlhatlhoba ngwedi?","The best answer is **C: E ne ya wela ka katlego gaufi le south pole ya ngwedi.**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states ""mme ya wela ka katlego gaufi le south pole ya Ngwedi"" (and it successfully crashed near the lunar south pole).

Let's look at why the other options aren't the best fit:

*   **A: E ne ya kotama gaufi le south pole ya ngwedi.** - While it ended up *near* the south pole, the word ""kotama"" implies a gentle landing, and the passage says it *crashed*. So, it's misleading.
*   **B: Go kotama ga yone go ne ga atlega.** - Similar to A, ""kotama"" (landing) implies a gentle descent, which is inaccurate since it crashed.
*   **D: E ne e rwele didirisiwa tse di botlhokwa tsa maranyane.** - The passage states the opposite: ""Ntleng le go rwala didirisiwa tse di botlhokwa tsa maranyane"" (Apart from carrying important equipment...). Thus, this is false."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke kgato efe ya go sireletsa kgatlhanong le bolwetse e e tla dirisiwang la bofelo?","The correct answer is **C: Mekento ya bolwetse jwa go ruruga ga boboko.**

Here's why:

The paragraph states that the government has promised millions of vaccines for encephalitis but that these vaccines are being prepared for *next year*. All the other measures (insecticides, pig farmers, mosquito nets) are being implemented *currently*. Thus, the vaccines are the *last* measure to be implemented.
"
Bolwetse jono bo tsena jang mo bathong?,"The correct answer is **A: Menang**.

The passage states: ""Bolwetse bo tsamaisiwa ke dikolobe, bo bo bo tsena batho ka **menang**."" (The disease is carried by pigs, but enters humans through **mosquitoes**.)
"
Go palelwa ke go dirisa polelwana ya bobedi go ka felela ka eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Tshwanelo ya mo isagweng ya go nyalana ga batho ba bong jo bo tshwanang**.

The passage states that the rejection of the second clause, which sought to legally ban same-sex marriage, *could* lead to same-sex marriages happening in the future.  Therefore, the failure to implement that clause could result in the *future right* to same-sex marriage.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, polelwana ya bobedi e ne ya kganelwa ka fa molaong leng?","The correct answer is **C: Ka Mantaga**.

The paragraph states that ""ba Ntlo ya Baemedi ba Setšhaba ba ile ba phimola seele sa bobedi mme molao oo o ile wa dumalanwa o ntse jalo ke ba Lekgotlakgolo ka Mosupologo"" (the House of Representatives removed the second clause, and the law was agreed upon as is by the Senate on Monday). This indicates the second clause was rejected on Monday.
"
"""Ke bomang ba ba neng ba filwe """"Dipampiri tsa Panama""""?""","The correct answer is **B: Bobegadikgang.**

The passage states: ""ke lereo le dirisiwang mo ditokomane di ka nna dimilione go tswa kwa setheong sa molao sa kwa Panama e leng Mossack Fonseca, tse di ntshitsweng ka sephiri go ba bega dikgang ka paka ya letlhafula ka ngwaga wa 2016."" This directly indicates the documents were leaked to journalists (bobegadikgang).
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mang yo bobegadikgang jwa Borithane bo neng jwa bolela gore o ne a laola bontsi jwa ditlamo tse di neng di dirisiwa go fitlha dikhumo?","The correct answer is **C: Deutsche bank.**

The passage states: ""Lokwalodikgang lwa Borithane e leng The Guardian le bontsha gore Deutsche Bank e e laolwang ke nngwetharong ya dikhampani di le 1 200 tsa dikgapetla tse di diretsweng go dira seno."" This directly indicates The Guardian (a British newspaper) reported Deutsche Bank controlled a significant portion of the shell companies used for hiding wealth.
"
"Ke dife tsa dikotsi tse di latelang tsa difofane, tse di neng tsa bolaya batho ba le bantsi?","The correct answer is **A: Sefofane se ne sa phutlhama fa se ne se ya kwa Armenia, se tswa kwa Iran.**

Here's why: The passage states that the deadliest accident was the plane crash en route to Armenia, killing 168 people.  The other options describe accidents with fewer fatalities.
"
Ke eng mo go tse di latelang se e seng lebaka la gore go nne le dikotsi tse dintsi tsa difofane kwa Iran?,"Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **C: Dithibelo tsa boditšhabatšhaba tse di thibelang go reka difofane tse diša.**

"Ke dintlha dife tse di latelang, tse di neng di seyo mo pegong ya dithutiso tsa kwa Iraq?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **B: Kitsiso ya gore ka diphetogo dingwe, dintwa tsa tumelo le tlhakatlhakano di ka emiswa.**

Pegelo e tlhalosa ka tlhamalalo gore ga go na ope yo o ka tlhomamisang gore go na le sepe se se ka emising dintwa tsa tumelo le tlhakatlhakano, e leng se se farologaneng le se se tlhagelelang mo karabong B. Dikgetho tse dingwe (A, C, le D) di boletsoe ka nepo mo temaneng."
Setlhopha sa dithutiso sa kwa Iraq  se ne sa se ka sa Tlhomamisa eng mo go seno se se latelang mo pegong ya sone?,"The correct answer is **A: Gore go itsisiwe gore go tla sireletswa melelwane kgatlhanong le botlhabetsi.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states the group said that ""ga go ope yo o ka tlhomamisang go re go na le sepe se se ka dirwang mo nakong ya gompieno se se ka emisang dintwa tsa tumelo le tlhakatlhakano"" which means ""no one can confirm that anything can be done in the present to stop the religious wars and chaos""
*   The group's report says that number one of their 78 points is ""go sireletsa melolwane ya Iraq kgatlhanong le ba ba botlhabetsi"" which means ""to protect Iraq's borders against invaders.""

Therefore, the only answer that the Setlhopha sa dithutiso sa kwa Iraq group did not ""Tlhomamisa"" is that they did not say that it was confirmed that borders would be protected against invaders."
"Go ya ka mapodisi, ke mang yo o neng a tsewa e le letsogo la moja la ga Provenzano?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Picco**.

The passage states: ""Mapodisi a ne a re Lo Picco o mo maemong a kwa godimo ka go re o nnile mothusi wa ga Provenzano kwa Palermo..."" (The police said Lo Picco was in a high position because he had been Provenzano's assistant in Palermo...). This implies that Lo Picco was a key figure and assistant to Provenzano.
"
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e neilweng mo karolong eno, ke eng se se gapileng botshelo jwa Falcone?","The correct answer is **A: Botshelo jwa gagwe bo ne jwa gapiwa ka nako ya ntwa e e neng e eteletswe pele ke Riina**

The passage states that the war led by Riina ""gapa matshelo a batlhani ba mmafia e bong Giovanni Falcone le Paolo Borsellino ka ngwaga was 1992.""
"
Ke efe mo go tse di latelang e e seng nngwe ya dilo tse Hitoshi Saito a di anaanelang?,"The correct answer is **A: Mmampodi wa Lefatshe makgetho a le mabedi**.

The passage states that Saito was an Olympic and World champion (singular, not plural). It also mentions he was chairman of the All Japan Judo Federation's training committee, and clearly implies he was a Judo expert. The passage specifically mentions that Saito won an Olympic gold medal.
"
Iwasaki o ne a kgona jang go falola nyalo?,"The correct answer is **B: Nepal**.

The text states that Iwasaki ""a falola nyalo ko Nepal"" which means he escaped a marriage in Nepal.
"
Ke mang yo o neng a tlhasela Iwasaki?,"The correct answer is **C: Ntša**.

The passage states that Iwasaki was ""tlhaselwa ke ntsa e e nang le molafu ko Tibet"" which translates to ""attacked by a dog with rabies in Tibet"". Therefore, a dog attacked Iwasaki.
"
Alonso o ne a wetsa leng lebelo la gagwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Fa Schumacher a sena go wetsa lobelo lwa gagwe**

The passage states that ""Michael Schumacher o feditse kgaisano ya gagwe morago ga Alonso"". This means Alonso finished his race *before* Schumacher did. Therefore, Alonso completed his race *after* Schumacher finished his race.
"
Ke eng se se neng sa dira gore Schumacher a fetse kgaisano ya gagwe pele ga nako?,"The correct answer is **D: Go senyega ga sasepenshene ya koloi**.

The passage explicitly states that Michael Schumacher finished his race early due to ""ditshenyego tsa sasepenshene go tswa mo dintweng tse dintsi mo kgaisanong"" which translates to ""suspension damage from many battles in the race.""
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke tiro ya ga mang go baya batho ba ba tshwerweng kwa lefelong la batshwarwa?","The correct answer is **D: Motsamaisi wa Kgotlatshekelo**.

The paragraph states: ""Molaodi o baya tlhwatlhwa ya madi a kgololo, fa kopo ya teng e atlegile, a bo a bega semmuso, ditatofatso tse di begilweng ke lepodise le le tshwereng mmelaelwa."" The word ""Molaodi"" here is referring to Motsamaisi wa Kgotlatshekelo.
"
"Go ya ka taelo ya kganelo ya nakwana ya go tsena mo ntlong e e umakilweng mo serapeng, batho ba ba tshwerweng ba tshwanetse go letlelelwa go nna le eng gore ba tshwarwe lobaka lo lo fetang diura di le 24?","The correct answer is **D: Tsheko**.

The passage states that the temporary restraining order issued by Judge Glynn was against holding people for more than 24 hours *without receiving bail hearings*. Therefore, to hold someone for more than 24 hours, they need to have a hearing (tsheko).
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke lebaka lefe le le sa dirisiwang go tlhalosa go emisa tswelopele ya ditlhopho?","The correct answer is **A: Tshireletsego e e nnang mo kotsing**.

Here's why:

*   **C: Ditshenyegelo tse di kwa godimo:** The passage explicitly states that the decision was made ""go sireletsa batho ba Afghanistan mo manokonkong a dituelo"". This refers to economic consequences.
*   **B: Kganetsano le molaotheo:** The passage says, ""Baemedi ba mafatshe ba re ba bone tlhakatlhakano ya selekanyo se se kwa godingwana mo molao-motheong wa Afghanistan"".
*   **D: Go potapota ga molaotheo:** It's a restatement of option B.

Option A: ""Tshireletsego e e nnang mo kotsing"" is NOT explicitly mentioned in the text as a reason for suspending the election process. While the passage refers to ""dipheretlhego"", it is specifically mentioned as something *caused by* the elections, not a pre-existing security concern that prompted the suspension. Therefore, this is the answer."
"Goreng, mo bofelong, badipolomate ba sa tsaya gore go a tlhokega go tswela pele ka ditlhopho?","The passage states: ""Baemedi ba mafatshe ba re ba bone tlhakatlhakano ya selekanyo se se kwa godingwana mo molao-motheong wa Afghanistan, mo go diriling go re ba tseye tshweetso ya go re tikilologo e nngwe ya ditlhopho ga e tlhokafale.""

This translates to: ""International representatives said they observed a high degree of **inconsistency with the Afghan constitution**, leading them to decide that another round of elections was unnecessary.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: Go ne go na le go potapota mo molaotheong** (There was inconsistency with the constitution)
"
Ke mang a tlamelang FATA ka ditirelo tsa boatlhodi?,"The passage states: ""Baemedi bano ba ikarabelela ka go naya ditirelo tsa puso le tsa bosiamisi..."". ""Baemedi bano"" refers to the ""Badiredi ba tsa Polotiki"".

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Baemedi ba sepolotiki**.
"
"Ke dife tsa dintlha tse di latelang ka “ Baemedi ba Sepolotiki” ba FATA, tse e seng nnete?","Karabo e e seng nnete ke **B: Ba ne ba tlhophiwa ke moporesidente wa Pakistane**.  Polelo e bolela gore moporesidente o ne a ba ""tlhoma,"" e seng gore o ne a ba tlhopha. Go tlhopha le go tlhoma ga go tshwane.
"
Ke sekgele sefe seo Emma Stone a neng a se tlhophetswe?,"The correct answer is **C: Modiragatsi wa mosadi yo o gaisang botlhe**.

The passage states that ""Gosling le Stone ba tlhophilwe go ya makgalokgannyeng a go phadisanyetsa sekgele sa Modiragatsi yo o Gaisang, wa monna, le wa mosadi, ka tatelano."" This directly translates to Gosling and Stone being nominated for Best Actor (male) and Best Actress (female), respectively.
"
Ke sekgele sefe seo baesekopo e neng e sa tlhophelwa sone?,"Based on the passage, the movie received nominations for:

*   Best Picture
*   Cinematography
*   Sound Mixing
*   Original Song

Therefore, the answer is **A: Setshwantsho se se di gaisang tsotlhe**."
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e sa leng ya tswelela pele e dira morago ga thoromo ya lefatshe?,"The correct answer is **D: Lefelo la go fetlha motlakase mo Niigata**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""NHK e begile gape go re lefelo le le fetlhang motlakase wa magatlapa lwa Kashiwazaki Kariwa mo lefatsheng lwa Niigita le ne le bereka sentle fela"". This directly indicates the power plant in Niigata was operating normally.
*   The passage mentions that equipment at the Shika nuclear plant was shut down. The airport and some train services were suspended. Therefore, other options are incorrect."
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e senyegileng ka ntlha ya thoromo ya lefatshe?","The passage states:

*   ""Ditsela dingwe di senyegile..."" (Some roads were damaged...)
*   ""...Boemafofane ba Noto mo Ishikawa bo tsweetswe."" (...Noto Airport in Ishikawa is closed.)
*   ""...didiriswa tse di laolang maatla tsa Nomoro 1 le 2 kwa lefelong le le tlhagisang maatla a nuklea la Shika di ne tsa tswalwa."" (the power control equipment No. 1 and 2 at the Shika nuclear power plant were shut down)
*   ""...magae a ka nna 9400 mo kgaolong a sena metsi le mangwe a ka nna 100 a sena motlakase"" (about 9400 homes in the area have no water and about 100 have no electricity)

Therefore, all options are correct and damaged by the earthquake. However, in this case, we have to choose the BEST one from the listed option which are explicitly mentioned as damaged. So, the answer is:

**C: Ditsela tse dingwe (Some roads)** and **D: Boemafofane ba Noto (Noto Airport)** and **B: Didiriswa tse pedi tse di laolang maatla kwa bodirelong jwa Shika (Two power control equipment at Shika plant)**

However, between these three, the **BEST** answer is **D: Boemafofane ba Noto** because the passage mentions the airport being *closed*, which implies significant damage rendering it unusable. The other options just say ""some roads damaged"" and ""equipment shut down"" which doesn't necessarily imply physical damage from the earthquake.

"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya dikgang tse di latelang, e e sa akarediwang mo tokomaneng?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke:

**B: Se se bakileng ntwa ya 1967**

"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e seng nngwe ya ditopo tsa Palestina?","The correct answer is **B: Go nna gone ga masole mo go tsweletseng, mokgatšheng wa Jordan**.

Here's why:

*   **P** states that the Israelis want soldiers for ten years while the **PA** is only agreeable for five years. This contradicts the notion of Palestinians desiring continuous military presence in the Jordan Valley.
*   Options **A**, **C**, and **D** are all mentioned in the paragraph as points of concern or debate for Palestine.
*   **A** relates to the statement: *""Palestine e batlang e beilwe mo melolwaneng ya pele ga ntwa ya Botlhaba-Gare ya 1967""*
*   **C** relates to the statement: *""isagwe ya naga ya Jerusalem""*
*   **D** relates to the statement: *""PA e dumelane go nna ga bano koo dingwaga dile tlhano fela""*"
Ma o ithutetse molao mo lefatsheng lefe?,"The correct answer is **A: Dinaga tse di Kopaneng tsa Amerika**.

The text states that Ma attended law school at Harvard, which is in the United States.
"
"Go ya ka temana,bobueledi ba lefatshe lefe bo thusitse mo phenyong ya Ma ya ditlhopho?","The correct answer is **D: China**.

The passage states that Ma was successful in a riding *advocating for increased ties with mainland China*. Therefore, his advocacy for mainland China helped him win the election.
"
"Jaaka go kailwe mo temaneng, Carolyn Wilson o ne a direla mang pele a fuduga kwa toropong eo?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**.

The passage states: ""Carolyn Wilson wa OHA o utsule madi a bone a peeletso, a bo a sia a tswa ka toropo"" which translates to ""Carolyn Wilson of OHA stole their deposit money, and fled town.""
"
"Ka go setse mabelo a le mane mo pakeng, ke mang yo o leng mo maemong a bone a Bommampodi ba Bakgweetsi?","The passage states that Hamlin is in third place and is twenty points behind the leader. It also states that Hamlin is five points ahead of Bowyer. Therefore, Bowyer is in fourth place.

So the correct answer is D: Bowyer.
"
"Morago ga lobelo lo lo umakilweng mo temaneng, Kahne o na le dintlha di le kae mo Bommampoding ba Bakgweetsi?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**

The passage states that Kahne is in fifth place with 2,220 points.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke ga kae batho ba bona didumedi tse di welang mo lefatsheng, tseo morago go fitlhelwang di tswa kwa polaneteng ya Mars?","The correct answer is **D: Ga masome a mararo le bone**

The passage states: ""...ke fela a ka nna masome a mararo le bone (34) a go tlhomamisitsweng a tlholegile ko lebopong la Mars."" This directly answers the question of how many meteorites found on Earth are confirmed to be from Mars.
"
"Jaaka go umakilwe mo temaneng, ke eng sa boammaruri ka matlapa a go fitlhetsweng a tswa kwa polaneteng ya Mars?","The correct answer is **D: Di 34**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states, ""mo mantsweng a a matona a a welang mo lefatsheng go tswa ko loaping (a a bidiwang ”di-meteorite”) a a ka nnang dikete di le masome a mabedi le bone (24, 000); ke fela a ka nna masome a mararo le bone (34) a go tlhomamisitsweng a tlholegile ko lebopong la Mars."" This translates to, ""Of the many large rocks falling to earth from space (called ""meteorites"") numbering approximately twenty-four thousand (24,000); only about thirty-four (34) have been confirmed to have originated from the planet Mars.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tsotlhe, di fitlhetswe ka Phukwi, ka nako ya fa maje a magolo a tswa kwa lefaufaung, a wela fa fatshe:** While some of the rocks were found during a meteorite shower in July, the passage doesn't say *all* of them were. Only 15 of them are linked to the meteorite shower in July.

*   **B: Di 24,000:** 24,000 is the approximate number of meteorites that have fallen to Earth, not specifically the number of meteorites confirmed to be from Mars.

*   **C: Boleng ba tsone bo feta ba gauta ka $11,000:** The passage mentions the rocks are sold for US$11,000 to $22,500 *per ounce*, which is ""ten times or more"" the value of gold. It doesn't state that their value exceeds gold by exactly $11,000."
Schumacher o rotse tiro neng?,"The correct answer is **B: Morago ga phenyo ya gagwe ya bosupa ya bommampodi**.

The passage states that Schumacher retired in 2006 after winning seven Formula 1 championships.
"
Massa o gobetse neng?,"The correct answer is **D: Pele ga paka ya 2009**.

The passage states that Massa was injured at the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2009 and would be out for at least the rest of the 2009 season. This means the injury happened *before* the 2009 season ended.
"
"Go ya ka temana, thulaganyo e tla ama jang AOL?","The correct answer is **C: Palo ya badirisi ba AOL e tla gaisiwa ke ya badirisi ba Yahoo le Microsoft** (The number of AOL users will be surpassed by the number of Yahoo and Microsoft users).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the combined number of users of Yahoo! and Microsoft services will compete with AOL. This directly implies that AOL's user base could be overtaken.
"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e ka felang, morago ga thulaganyo e ntšha?","The correct answer is **C: Kgololosego ya AOL ya go tlhabolola mmaraka ka lebelo la yone**.

Let's break down why:

*   **P (Premise):** AOL's ability to innovate and develop the IM market has been due to its widespread use in the United States. This dominance might end because Yahoo! and Microsoft's combined services are competing with AOL.
*   **Q (Question):** What is likely to end due to this new arrangement?

Based on the premise, the most logical consequence is that AOL will lose its freedom/ability to develop the market at its own pace. The competition from Yahoo! and Microsoft will force them to react and potentially slow down their independent innovation.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Tlhabololo ya inthanete e aname mo Dinageng tse di Kopaneng tsa Amerika (Internet development spreading in the United States):** Competition in IM doesn't inherently stop the general development of the internet.
*   **B: Tiriso ya mmaraka wa IM (Use of the IM market):** Competition would potentially increase or shift the *use* of the IM market, not necessarily end it.
*   **D: Tirisanommogo ya Yahoo le Microsoft (Collaboration between Yahoo and Microsoft):** The premise suggests the collaboration is the *cause* of the potential change, not something that will end itself.
"
"Ke batho ba le bakae ba ba bolailweng mo tlhaselong, ba e neng e se mapodisi?","The correct answer is **C: 0**.

The passage states that two police officers were killed. It doesn't mention any other fatalities. Therefore, the number of non-police officers killed is 0.
"
Ke mang yo o begileng mmelaelwa mo tlhaselong?,"The answer is **A: Mapodise**.

The passage states, ""Mapodise a re ba belaela go re tlhaselo e dirilwe ke bangwe ba go tweng ke masole a Daesh (ISIL)"". This translates to ""Police said they suspect the attack was carried out by suspected Daesh (ISIL) militants."" Therefore, the police are the ones who reported the suspected perpetrator.
"
"Ka ntlha ya maemo a Florida, a naga e e tsayang gotlhe fa e fenya,ke eng se se abetsweng Mitt Romney?","The correct answer is **C: Baemedi botlhe ba puso**.

The passage states that Florida is a ""jaakanagayamotupi-o-tsea-gotlhelele"", which translates to ""winner-take-all"" state. This means the winner, Mitt Romney, receives all of Florida's delegates.
"
"Go ya ka temana,Gingrich o bone diperesente di le kae tsa diboutu mo ditlhophong tsa go itlhophela ntlhopheng yo ba mo ratang?","The correct answer is **B: Diperesente di le 32**.

The passage states: ""Mmueledi wa pele wa U.S. wa House Newt Gingrich o tshotse maemo a bobedi ka diperesente di le 32."" which translates to ""Former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich took second place with 32 percent.""
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke mang a sa tswelelang ka bontlhopheng morago ga dipholo tsa khokhase?","The correct answer is **B: Bachmann**.

The passage states that ""Bachmann... o ile a tsaya tshwetso ya go emisa letsholo"" (Bachmann... decided to suspend the campaign). This means she is no longer continuing with the campaign.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mang yo o tlotlomaditseng ntlhopheng yo mongwe morago ga dipholo tsa khokhase?","The correct answer is **B: Gingrich**.

The passage states that ""Gingrich o ile a akgola Santorum..."". This means Gingrich praised Santorum.
"
Lefelo le le lengwe fela foo lenaneo le neng le bontshiwa pele ga 2015 e ne e le kae?,"The correct answer is **A: TogiNet Radio**.

The passage states: ""Ko tshimologong, lenaneo leno le ne le gasiwa fela mo tsebeng ya nthanete ya seromanowa sa Toginet..."" which directly translates to ""In the beginning, this program was broadcast only on the internet page of the radio station TogiNet..."" Since the question asks where it was shown *before* 2015, and AstroNet Radio was only started *in* 2015, TogiNet Radio is the only valid option.
"
Seteišene se tlhalosa lenaneo jaaka le le sekametseng letlhakoreng lefe?,"The best answer is **C: Go rata dilo tsa bogologolo**

Here's why:

* The first sentence says the program is described as ""a classic program mixed with new pleasures,"" which points to an appreciation for the old.
* The text also mentions the program originally highlighted ""vintage voice actors"" which is synonymous with ""classic"" or ""go rata dilo tsa bogologolo.""
"
"David Headley o kokoantse eng e, mo bofelong, e thusitseng tlhaselo ka setlhopha sa balwelakgololosego?","The correct answer is **A: Tshedimosetso**.

The passage states that ""Go sekaseka le go batla tshedimosetso ga ga David Headley go ne ga tlela mosola borraditlhobolo ba le 10 ba setlhopha sa batlhabani sa Pakistani, Lakshar-e-Taiba."" This translates to ""David Headley's reconnaissance and information gathering benefited the 10 gunmen from the Pakistani militant group, Lakshar-e-Taiba.""

Therefore, the information collected by David Headley was what ultimately aided the attack.
"
Ke mokgwa ofe wa dipalangwa o o neng o dirisiwa ke setlhopha sa balwelakgololosego go tsaya loeto go ya kwa Mumbai?,"The correct answer is **C: Mokoro**

The passage states: ""Batlhasedi ba Mumbai ba gorogile ka sekepe ka kgwedi ya Ngwanatsele a tlhola matsatsi a le 26 ka 2008...""  ""Sekepe"" translates to ""boat"".
"
"Ke mafoko afe a a bontshang ka go nepagala,dipholo tsa motshameko wa Nadal le Raonic tsa Brisbane Open, tse di umakilweng mo temaneng?","The correct answer is **A: Raonic o fentse Nadal** (Raonic won against Nadal).

The passage states ""O fentswe mo malobeng ke Raonic kwa Brisbane Open"" which translates to ""He was beaten recently by Raonic at the Brisbane Open."" This clearly indicates Raonic won.

The other options are incorrect:

*   B: The 88% refers to Nadal's overall point accumulation in the game.
*   C: The passage indicates Nadal was defeated by Raonic.
*   D: The 76 points refer to Nadal in the first set."
"Go ya ka temana, kemo ya motshameko wa Nadal le Raonic e ne e le jang morago ga go thankgololwa?","The correct answer is **D: Raonic o fentse Nadal**.

The text states ""O fentswe mo malobeng ke Raonic kwa Brisbane Open,"" which means Nadal was defeated by Raonic at the Brisbane Open. The other options are either stats from the game or Nadal's overall record against Canadian players, not the result of the specific match being discussed.
"
"Ke lenaneo lefe la puo, le le sa akaretswang mo dikgasong tsa ntha tse tharo tsa Naked News?","The correct answer is **C: Se-Japane**.

"
"Go ya ka temana, ke kae foo dikgaso tsa Naked News tse disha di ka se bonweng gone?","Karabo e nepagetseng ke **C: Mafelo a bobogelo**.

"
"Ke efe ya mafoko a a latelang, e e bontshang ka go nepagala,dipholo tsa mabelo kwa Bommampoding?","A re sekasekeng mafoko a a umakilweng:

Ke ofe wa ba ba latelang yo NBA e sweditseng go mo sekega?,"The correct answer is **A: Paka ya baseketebolo**.

The passage states that the NBA suspended its **season** due to concerns about COVID-19 after a Utah Jazz player tested positive. Therefore, the NBA suspended the season (paka ya baseketebolo).
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se se neng sa dira gore go nne le matshwenyego mo NBA mabapi le mogare?","The correct answer is **D: Go tlhomamisitswe gore motshameki wa Utah Jazz o na le mogare**.

The passage states that the NBA's decision to suspend the season came ""after one of the Utah Jazz players tested positive for COVID-19.""  This directly supports option D.  While the other options might be plausible, they are not directly stated in the given text.
"
Ke mang yo o nositseng nno e e tlisitseng phenyo mo motshamekong wa Washington Capitals kgatlhanong le Atlanta Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **A: Nicklas Backstrom**.

The passage doesn't explicitly state that this was the game-winning goal, but of the options given, Backstrom is the only one mentioned as scoring a goal in the game.
"
Ke mang yo a nositseng nno ya gagwe ya bo 60 ya paka mo motshamekong wa Capitals kgatlhanong le Thrashers ?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

"
Banka ya Northern Rock e tlhokile neng tshegetso go tswa kwa pusong?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka nako ya mathata a tuelo ya matlo**.

The passage states: ""Northern Rock e ne kile ya kopa thuso mabapi le manokonoko a seru se se neng se wetse bareki ba mantlo ka 2007."" This translates to ""Northern Rock had previously requested help regarding the difficulties of the crisis that had befallen home buyers in 2007."" This clearly indicates they needed government support *during* the housing crisis.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke afe a mafoko ano, a a tlhalosang ka nepagalo, tirisano ya Virgin Group le banka ya Northern Rock?","The correct answer is **B: Virgin Group e rekile banka morago ga gore e dirwe ya bosetšhaba**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Virgin o rekile """"banka e e molemo"""" fela ya Northern Rock, e seng kopone ya tlhokomelo dithoto."" This implies Virgin Group successfully purchased a portion of the bank (the ""good bank"") *after* it was nationalized and split.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Virgin Group, gape, e rekile setheo sa tsamaiso ya dithuo ya Northern Rock:** The passage states Virgin did *not* buy the asset management company.
*   **C: Virgin Group e ile ya neela banka tshegetso ya potlako ka nako ya mathata a tuelo ya matlo:** The passage says the *Government* provided emergency support.
*   **D: Virgin Group e ne ya tlhagisa gore e ka reka banka ka bokae morago ga fa e se na go diriwa banka ya bosetšhaba:** The passage mentions that Virgin's offer was rejected *before* nationalization. While they eventually bought part of the bank *after* nationalization, the statement that the offer was made after nationalization is incorrect."
"Jaaka go tlhalositswe mo temaneng, ke setšhaba sefe se se angwang ke go saeniwa ga tumalano ya Kyoto ya maemo a bosa ?","Based on the passage:

*   **The passage explicitly states that the Kyoto agreement singles out the United States.** The US is mentioned as the only developed nation yet to ratify the agreement.
*   While Australia is discussed in terms of its *previous* refusal, the passage focuses on the implications of the agreement for the United States now that Australia has signed.
*   India and China are mentioned, but only as countries that *were not* bound by the same emissions targets under the original Kyoto protocol.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Dinaga tse di Kopaneng** (The United States)"
Puso ya pele ya Australia e ne e akanya gore go dumalana ka go saena ga Kyoto go ka senya eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Itsholelo ya lefatshe**.

The passage states: ""Puso ya pele ya boratangwao ya Australia e ganne go dumalana le Kyoto, e supa fa leano le le tla senya **itsholelo ya lefatshe** e e ikaegileng ka go rekisa magala...""

This clearly indicates the hunters were recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.

The passage states: ""Fa go remeletswe mo bonelong ja matlapa a bogologolo, go supega go re go kgaogana go diragetse pele ga nako..."" This directly indicates that the separation, according to the ancient rock findings, happened earlier than previously thought.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se se diragetseng ka bonako go feta ka fa go neng go lebeletswe ka teng?","The correct answer is **B: Kgaogano**

The passage states: ""go supega go re go kgaogana go diragetse pele ga nako e neng e akantswe..."" which translates to ""it appears that the split happened earlier than expected..."" This indicates that ""kgaogano"" (split/separation) occurred faster than anticipated.

Ke eng se se neng se sa buiwa mo pegong ya moragonyana ya ditheo tsa dikgang tsa Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **A: Sefofane se ne se amogetse matshosetsi a bomo**.

The initial report said the plane was *hijacked*. The later report said the plane received a *bomb threat*. The question asks what was *not* said in the *later report*, and the hijacking was only in the first report. All other options were mentioned in the later report. Therefore, A is the correct answer.
"
Ke eng seo se neng se sa buiwa mo pegong ya ntlha ya ditheo tsa dikgang tsa Xinhua ?,"Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **D: Sefofane se ne se amogetse matshosetsi a bomo**.

Ke eng se se neng sa phatlhaladiwa ke Sara Danius mo thulaganyong ya seromamowa?,"The correct answer is **D: Komiti e tla emisa maiteko a go ikgolaganya le Bob Dylan**.

The passage states that Sara Danius announced the committee has given up trying to contact Bob Dylan. While option B is also true, option D is the core message she was conveying.
"
Ke mang yo go neng go pala go mo fitlhelela?,"The correct answer is **D: Bob Dylan**.

The passage states that the committee was unable to contact Bob Dylan regarding his Nobel Prize.
"
"Ke mang a rebotseng maitlamo, a re ke “kgatelopele”?","The correct answer is **C: Gordon Johndroe**.

The passage states that ""Moanamisa mafoko wa ga Bush, Gordon Johndroe o rebotse maitlamo a Korea bokone..."" which translates to ""Bush's spokesperson, Gordon Johndroe, released a statement about North Korea..."". Thus, Gordon Johndroe is the one who released the statement including the term ""kgatelopele"" (progress).
"
Ke ditempe di le kae tse Słania a di diretseng dinaga tse dingwe?,"The correct answer is **A: Go ka feta 2,000**.

The passage states he created over 1,000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries. Therefore, the total number of stamps he created for other countries would be above 1,000, in addition to the 1000 he did for Sweden, hence a total of over 2,000.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se se ka bong se baka go dutla mo go tswelelang ga tanka ya letsha?","The correct answer is **C: Go buduloga ga sediriswa se se laolang botsididi le molelo mo teng ga tanka**.

The passage states: ""Go tloga ka Laboraro phirimane, tanka ya letsha e ne e ntse e dutla, gongwe e le ka ntlha ya go buduloga ga sedirisiwa se se laolang botsididi le molelo mo teng ga tanka."" This directly links the leak to a failure of the temperature/fire control device.

"
"Ga jaana, metsi a kwa Wateng ya borobongwe, a tsamaya go fitlha kae?","The correct answer is **C: Se se fitlhang motho mo lethekeng**.

The passage states that the water from the Ninth Ward is flowing into a nearby canal because the levees overflowed. While the Ninth Ward saw 20-foot floods during Hurricane Katrina, the passage says the water is flowing into a 100-foot wide canal now that the nearby levees have overflowed. The passage does not explicitly mention the exact depth of the water flowing from the Ninth Ward now, but it is implied to be shallow given the situation.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dikgato di le 20**: This refers to the flood level during Hurricane Katrina, not the current water level.
*   **B: Dikhilomitara tse 6**: This refers to the amount of rain that can cause damage, not the location of the water.
*   **D: Dikgato di le 100**: This is the width of the canal, not the depth of the water flowing into it.
*   **C: Se se fitlhang motho mo lethekeng**: This is the only option that is logical since it can be inferred that the water that has overflowed from the levees is shallow."
"Ka nako ya Kgwanyape ya Katrina, go diragetse eng mo Wateng ya borobongwe?","The correct answer is **C: Metsi a morwalela a ne a le bogodimo jwa dikgato di le 20**

The passage states that ""wate ya borobongwe, e e boneng merwalela e e bogodimo jwa dikgato dile 20 ka nako ya kgwanyape ya Katrina..."" This directly answers the question about what happened at the Ninth Ward during Hurricane Katrina.

*   **C: Gore a tsamaiso e e tshwanetseng e ne e latetswe:** O boletse gore bookelo bo ne bo setse morago tsamaiso ya go laola kamano ya bolwetse.
*   **D: Maemo a gajaana a molwetse:** O boletse gore molwetse o ne a amogetswe a le mo maemong a a tlhomameng.

Hamilton ga a ka a tlhomamisa ka gope kgonagalo ya balwetse ba bangwe ya go tshwaetswa ke mogare. O buile fela ka dikgato tsa go itshireletsa, mme ga a ka a re sepe ka kgonagalo ya gore mogare o aname."
Ke eng sengwe se borasaense ba batlang go se tlhaloganya?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka fa Lefatshe le bopilweng ka teng**.

The passage states that scientists hope to understand how planets form, ""bogolobogolo jang polanete ya Lefatshe"" (especially the planet Earth), which is directly related to how Earth was formed.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke seabe sefe se mapodise a selegae se nnileng le sone mo go tswaleng?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke: **C: Ba ne ba kaela bakgweetsi ba dijanaga go ya ditseleng tse dingwe**

Temana e supa gore mapodise a le masome a marobabobedi a ne a tlisiwa go tla go laola pharakano. Go laola pharakano gantsi go akaretsa go kaela bakgweetsi ba dijanaga. Dikgetho tse dingwe ga di thusege.
"
Go diragetse eng ka matseno a diphanele ka nako ya go tswala?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba ne ba thibelwa go tsena** (They were blocked from entry).

The passage states that trash trucks were used to block the gates, implying that access was denied.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo se sa diragalang pele ga fa motsayaditshwantsho a thulwa ke sejanaga?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **D: Motsayaditshwantsho o ne a kgona go tsaya Bieber setshwantsho**.

Temana ga e bue sepe ka gore motsayaditshwantsho o kgonne go tsaya Bieber setshwantsho pele ga a thulwa. Dintlha tse dingwe tsotlhe di bolelwa di diragetse pele ga kotsi.
"
Motsayaditshwantsho o ne a leka go dira eng pele ga fa a thulwa ke sejanaga?,"The correct answer is **B: Tsaya ditshwantsho tsa mapodise a emisa dijanaga**

The passage states: ""Mafarathata a maranyane a dikgang a TMZ a re motsaya dinepe one a emisa koloi ya gagwe fa thoko ga Sepulveda Boulvelda a bo a leka go tsaya senepe sa mapodisi pele ga a kgabaganya mmila...""
"
"Ke mafoko afe a a sa tlhaloseng ka go nepagala, maemo a moporesidente morago ga fa go tlhomamisitswe gore o na le mogare?","The correct answer is **D: O na le letshoroma**.

The text states:

*   ""Seemo sa moporesidente se tlhomame"" (His condition is stable) - This eliminates C.
*   ""Kwa ntle ga mofikela le mometso o o botlhoko"" (Apart from a cold and a sore throat) - This eliminates A and B (because the text says he has a sore throat, not that he feels unwell generally).
*   The text doesn't mention a fever, so D is the correct answer.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke afe a mafoko a a latelang, ka moporesidente, a e leng nnete?","The correct answer is **C: O ikutlwa sentle mo e leng gore a ka direla kwa gae**

Here's why:

*   **P** states that he feels well enough to work remotely, despite his cold and sore throat.
*   **A** and **D** are incorrect because the passage does not say he does not have a fever and that he has a severe infection.
*   **B** is incorrect because the passage says he will stay at home for a *few days*, not weeks, and expects to be back in the office on Monday."
"Go ya ka temana, Setsuatsue sa Boboatsatsi se se bidiwang Gonu se solofetswe go tswela pele se koafala neng?","Kgonagalo e e nepagetseng ke **B: Fa diphefo di fokotsegile go ya go dikhilomitara di ka nna 83 ka ura**.

Lebaka:

Temana e bolela gore mo mosong oo, diphefo di ne di tsamaya ka lebelo la 83km/h, *mme go solofetswe go re seemo se tla tswelela go tokafala*. Se se kaya gore koafalo e ne e setse e diragala e bile e solofetswe go tswelela pele. Dikgato tse dingwe di bontsha dikgato tse dingwe mo go koafatseng.
"
Diphefo di ne di le bonako bo bo kaakang fa Setsuatsue sa Boboatsatsi se se bidiwang Gonu se ne se le bogale thata?,"The correct answer is **C: Dimaele di le 149 ka ura**.

The passage states: ""Setsuwatsuwe wa Gonu, se se teilweng ka kgetse ya matlhare a sethare sa di-palms mo puong ya se-Maldives, se ne se le diphefo tse di tsamayang ka lebelo la dikhilomithara di le 240 ka oura (dimmaele tse149 ka oura).""

The question asks how fast the winds were at Gonu's peak. The passage gives the speed in both kilometers per hour and miles per hour, but the answers are given in the units of miles per hour. Thus the correct answer is 149 miles per hour.
"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e sa tseweng jaaka mokgwa wa Karenia brevis?,"The correct answer is **C: E na le disele tse dintsi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Karenia brevis occurs naturally in ""diphologolong kgotsa dijalo tse di nang le sele ele nngwe"" (animals or plants that have a single cell). This means Karenia brevis are single-celled organisms, and therefore, the opposite of multi-celled.
*   The other options are supported by the passage:
    *   A: The passage directly says that red tide is caused by high concentrations of Karenia brevis, implying that it is a type of ""bolele"" (bloom).
    *   B: The passage states that Karenia brevis produces a toxin that can kill nerves in humans.
    *   D: The passage states that Karenia brevis blooms naturally."
Ke efe ya tse di latelang tseo Karena brevis a sa kgoneng go di dira?,"Karabo e nepahetseng ke **B: Oketsega mo palong ka bonako mo maemong mangwe le mangwe**.

Polelo e bolela gore Karenia brevis e hlahiswa ke maemo a ikhethang a hlaha ka tlhaho mme e ka oketseha ha maemo a nepahetse. Ha e re e ka ikatisa kapele maemong ohle. Likhetho tse ling li hlalositsoe ka ho hlaka polelong joalo ka litla-morao tsa Karenia brevis.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e sa diragalang ka ntlha ya Kgwanyape e e bidiwang Felicia?","The correct answer is **D: Morwalela wa mo mmileng**

Here's why:

*   **A: Go na ga pula go go solegelang molemo (Beneficial rainfall):** The passage states ""Dipula ya teng, e e kaeilweng e gorogile mo selekanyang sa di-inch di le 6.34, mo selakanyetsing sengwe ko Oahu, go tlhalositswe ”e le mosola”"".
*   **B: Go na ga pula, go tsamaya le tumo ya maru (Rain, accompanied by thunder):** The passage states ""Dipula dingwe e ne e le tsa matlakadibe le magadima a kgapetsakgapetsa"".
*   **C: Legadima le le ipoapoeletsang (Repeated lightning):** The passage states ""Dipula dingwe e ne e le tsa matlakadibe le magadima a kgapetsakgapetsa"".
*   **D: Morwalela wa mo mmileng (Street flooding):** The passage states ""...mme le go fitlha gompieno, ga go na tshenyo kgotsa morwalela ope o o begilweng"".

Therefore, street flooding did not occur."
"Ke mafoko afe ka Kgwanyape e e bidiwang Felicia, a e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **B: Santlha, e ne e tlhaotswe jaaka boboatsatsi ba diphefo tsa lobelo lo lo kwa tlase, pele ga fa e fetoga go nna setsuatsue sa Setlhopha 4**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Felicia *was* a Category 4 hurricane and then weakened. It doesn't say anything about it initially being classified as a tropical depression before becoming a hurricane. This makes statement B factually incorrect based on the given information.

Let's look at why the other options are true:

*   **A: Pula e e feletsang e na, e ne ya ungwela Oahu:** The passage mentions that the rainfall (6.34 inches at one gauge on Oahu) was described as ""beneficial"" (ungwela).
*   **C: Bontsi ba setlhaketlhake bo itemogetse pula:** The passage states that ""the islands experienced light rainfall,"" meaning most of the islands experienced rain.
*   **D: Pula nngwe e ne e tsamaya le legadima:** The passage explicitly says that some of the rain was heavy with frequent lightning."
"Ke mafoko afe a a bontshang ka nepagalo,dipoelo tsa Grand Prix ya Hungary ya 2009?","Go ya ka mafoko a P, dikarabo tse di nepagetseng ke:

*   **C: Piquet Jr. o ne a lebogiswa tiro morago ga foo** - Mafoko a bolela gore Piquet Jr. o ne a kobiwa morago ga potologo ya Hungary ya 2009.

Dikarabo tse dingwe ga di a nepafala go ya ka mafoko:

*   **A: Fernando Alonso o ne a amega mo kotsing** - Mafoko a supa gore kotsi ya Piquet Jr. e ne e diragetse morago ga nako e khutswane Alonso a sena go pit stop. Ga go na se se supang gore Alonso o ne a amega mo kotsing.
*   **B: Piquet Jr. o fentse** - Mafoko a supa gore Alonso o fentse mme e seng Piquet Jr.
*   **D: Sejanaga sa pabalesego se ne sa amega mo kotsing** - Ga go na se se supang gore sejanaga sa pabalesego se ne sa amega mo kotsing. Sejanaga sa pabalesego se ne sa dirisiwa."
Thulano e diragetse neng?,"The correct answer is **C: Pele sejanaga sa pabalesego se tswa**.

The passage states that Piquet Jr. crashed shortly after Alonso's pit stop, which then brought out the safety car. So the crash happened *before* the safety car came out.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e tsereng nako e nnye go feta ka fa babatlisisi ba neng ba dumela peleng?","The passage states that the new species formed in ""only two generations,"" which is faster than previously believed for speciation. This aligns with option A, ""Popo ya mefuta e e farologaneng ya ditshedi"" (Formation of different species). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Popo ya mefuta e e farologaneng ya ditshedi**
"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e neng e sa begiwa ke babatlisisi?,"The passage mentions the following:

*   **A: Mo go neng ga bopiwa mofuta o montšha wa ditshedi (The creation of a new species):** The passage clearly states a new bird species was formed.
*   **B: Lobaka lo tsamaiso ya go iphetogela e lo tsayang (The time the evolutionary process takes):** The passage states that while evolution usually takes much longer, this happened in just two generations.
*   **D: Dinonyane di akarediwa mo tsadisong (The birds involved in the breeding):** The passage names the specific finch species involved in the interbreeding.

The passage **does not** explicitly give the name of the *new* species. It only mentions the parent species.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Leina la mofuta o montšhwa wa ditshedi (The name of the new species)**."
CowParade e tla diriwa kae?,"The correct answer is **B: Mo toropong ya Bucharest**.

The passage states: ""Toropo e tla nna ya ntlha mo borwa-botlhaba jwa Yuropa go ka tshwara moletlo wa CowParade..."", which directly indicates that the CowParade will be held in Bucharest.
"
"Ke efe ya mafoko a a latelang e e tlhalosang ka nepagalo, CowParade?","The correct answer is **D: Ke tiragalo ya bosetšhaba ya botaki e kgolo go di gaisa mo lefatsheng**.

The passage states that CowParade is ""tiragalo e kgolo ya lefatshe ya botaki"" which translates to ""the biggest global art event"". This is closest in meaning to option D.
"
Ke eng se se bakileng gore Russia e sekege tiriso ya di II-76?,"The correct answer is **B: Kotsi**.

The passage states that Russia temporarily suspended all II-76 flights ""morago ga kotsi eo"" (after that accident). The accident, where an engine failed, is the direct cause stated in the text.
"
II-76 ke eng?,"The correct answer is **C: Motšhini o o fofang**.

The passage states that the Il-76 is a plane, therefore a ""motšhini o o fofang"" (flying machine).
"
Ke mang a thapileng setlhopha sa bakwadi sa The Simpsons?,"The correct answer is **B: Simon**.

The passage states that Simon ""o ne a ikarabelela ka go hira bakwadi ba metshameko ba ntlha"" (he was responsible for hiring the first game writers).
"
"Go ya ka Fluke, ke mang a neng a mo romela ditshwaelo tse di molemo le thotloetso?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **D: Batho ba borre le bomme**.

Se se itlhalosa sentle mo polelong ya P: ""ditshwaelo di le dintsi, tse di siameng le thotloetso, tse di rometsweng ke **banna le basadi**...""."
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo batho bangwe ba sa batleng basadi ba bua kgatlhanong le sone?","Karabo e nepahetseng ke **C: Boitekanelo ba basadi**.

Tlhaloso: Temana e bontsha sentle gore maiteko a batho bangwe e ne e le go kganela basadi go bua ka botsogo jwa bone. Se se raya gore batho ba ba rileng ba ne ba sa batle basadi ba bua kgatlhanong le boitekanelo ba basadi.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke polanete efe e e nang le maatla go feta?","The correct answer is **A: Lefatshe**.

The passage states, ""...there is a planet group that exhibits more activity than Titan, and its name is Earth."" This clearly indicates that Earth is considered more active than Titan.
"
"Dinoka le matsha, tse di nang le seedi se se bonalatsang di supilwe mo polaneteng efe?","The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

The passage states ""E tsile go itshwara jaaka metsi. Ga e na mmala fela jaaka metsi...dipolanete se se bontshang matlhagatlhaga go feta Titan"". This indicates Titan has liquid bodies (like rivers and lakes) that are clear.
"
"Ke efe ya diphitlhelelo tseno, e e seng ka ntlha ya thibololo ya diphofa?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **A: Mmala wa diphuka tsa phologolo**.

Lebaka:

*   Temana e bolela ka tlhamalalo gore baitsaanape ba tsa boranyane ba ne ba kgona go bona gore diphuka di ne di le bosetlha fa godimo le borobenyana ko tlase. Seno se se theilwe mo thibololong ya diphofa.
*   Dintlha tse dingwe tse di tlhophilweng di akaretsa go dira ditshwetso le dintlha ka go tlhobaela ga diphofa."
Diphofa tsa di- dinosaur di ne di se na eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Rachis**.

The passage explicitly states ""Ka gonne diphuka tsa dinosaur di sena dithupana tse di itekanetseng, tse di bidiwang di rachis..."". This translates to ""Because dinosaur wings did not have complete shafts, called rachis...""
"
Ke efe ya mafoko a a latelang ka ZMapp e e seng nnete?,"Karabo e e seng nnete ke:

**A: E dirilwe ka dilwantshamalwetse**

Ga go na gope mo temaneng go buiwang ka gore ZMapp e dirilwe ka dilwantshamalwetse. Dintlha tse dingwe tsotlhe di nepa ka fa temaneng.
"
"Ke afe a mafoko a a latelang a a tlhalosang ka nepagalo,teko ya PALM?","The correct answer is **C: ZMapp e ne e dirisiwa jaaka mola wa motheo wa teko**.

The passage states: ""Mo tshekatshekong ya PALM, ZMapp e ne e le one molemo o o neng o dirisiwa go tshwantshanya boleng ja melemo e meraro e mengwe."" This directly translates to ""In the PALM trial, ZMapp was the drug used to compare the effectiveness of three other drugs."" This means ZMapp was used as a baseline or benchmark.
"
Babatlisisi ba akanya gore tshitswana e ntšhwa e tla nna botlhokwa go gaisa?,"The correct answer is **A: Dinaga tse di nang le lotseno lo lo kwa tlase**.

The passage explicitly states that the researchers believe this device will be particularly helpful in impoverished countries where early detection and treatment of diseases like cancer are lacking.
"
Ke mokgwa ofe o o tla dirisiwang go dira sediriswa sa tlhatlhobo?,"The correct answer is **B: Motšhini wa tlwaelo wa go gatisa wa inkjet**.

The passage states: ""tshitswana e nnye fela thata e e ka bopiwang ka porintara fela a malatsi otlhe e e dirisang maranyane a inkjet"". This clearly indicates that a standard inkjet printer is used to create the diagnostic device.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mafoko afe ka lobate scarps a e seng a nnete?","The correct answer is **D: Ga di a bonwa ka bontsi mo boalong ba ngwedi**.

The passage states that ""Mekgokolosa eno e ne e fitlhelwa gotlhe mo ngweding..."" which translates to ""These scarps were found all over the moon..."". Therefore, option D directly contradicts the information given in the text.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke kgopolo efe malebana le dipopego tse di farologaneng tsa lefatshe, e e supang gore go na le tiro ya jioloji e e diragalang mo ngweding?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **D: Dipopego tse di farologaneng tsa lefatshe di tlhodilwe bošeng jaana.**

Tlhaloso: Temana e tlhalosa gore mekgokolosa e e boleta e fitlhetswe e onaditswe ke maemo a bosa, se se bontshang gore ditiragalo tsa jeoloji tse di e dirileng di diragetse bosheng jaana. Seno se ganetsana le kgopolo ya gore ngwedi ga e na tiro ya jeoloji. Ka jalo, kgopolo e e supang gore go na le tiro ya jeoloji e e diragalang mo ngweding ke gore dipopego tse di farologaneng tsa lefatshe di tlhodilwe bošeng jaana.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo se ka se nneng teng ka bontsi go fitlhela go bonwa molato?","The correct answer is **A: Ditshwaelo go ya pele**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Offisi ya Crown, e e okametseng tsa bosekisi, e boleletse babega-dikgang go re ga go na go nna le kakgelo, go fitlhelela molato o kwadisiwa semmuso.""
*   Therefore, the Office of the Crown indicated that there would be no further comment until the charge was officially registered."
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se e seng bothata gajaana go batshwari ba manyibi?","The answer is **D: Kgapetla e e gakologang**.

The passage explicitly mentions:

*   **A: Maemo a bosa a a boitshegang** (maemo a bosa a a sa iketlang)
*   **B: Bokana ba kgapetla** (selekanyo sa metsi a a gatsetseng)
*   **C: Bokima ba kgapetla** (bokima jwa metsi a a gatsetseng)

It doesn't mention ""kgapetla e e gakologang"" (melting ice) as a current problem. The problem is too much ice that is very thick and bad weather that is impacting the search."
"Mo godimo ga gore go nne le kgapetla, ke eng gape se se amang maiteko a go namola?","The correct answer is **B: Maemo a bosa a sa iketlang**

The passage states: ""Mo godimo ga go thubega ga dikgapetla tsa metsi, **maemo a bosa a a sa iketlalang** a kgoreletsa maiteko a go falotsa.""
"
Ke tumelo efe e Roberts a tilang go e tlhomamisa?,"The correct answer is **C: Tshimologo ya botshelo**.

The passage explicitly states that Roberts ""o ile a gana go bua kaga moo a dumetseng fa botshelo bo simolola"" which translates to ""refused to speak about where he believes life begins"". This directly addresses option C. The other options are mentioned in the passage but not as something Roberts specifically avoided confirming his belief on.
"
"Ke kgang efe e Roberts a neng a akanya gore e ka ga mekgwa e e sa siamang, mme go ka se tlotliwe ka yone?","The correct answer is **D: Dintlha tse di kgethegileng tsa dikgetse**.

The passage states that Roberts refused to comment on *where life begins*, which is a crucial question regarding abortion. He believed it was unethical to comment on the specifics of a potential case. Therefore, the question he considered unethical to comment on related to the specific details of cases.
"
Ke kae mo marang a mabedi a lesedi a ageletsweng gore a lebe kwa loaping mo bosigong?,"The answer is **A: Go ya kwa loaping**.

The passage states: ""Marang a mabedi a lesedi a ageletswe go re a lebe kwa loaping mo bosigong."" (Two beams of light are set up to point towards the sky at night).
"
"Go ya Ka temana, dikago tse dintha tse di goletseng kwa godimo di agiwa neng mo setsheng?","The correct answer is **D: Kago e tsweletse**.

The passage states ""Kago ya dikago tsa meago e kwa godimo di tsweletse kwa teng,"" which translates to ""Construction of high-rise buildings is continuing there."" This implies ongoing construction, not restricted to a specific time like daytime, 8:46 AM, or only nighttime.
"
Ke tshedimosetso efe e e bontshang gore The Seven Sisters ke magaga?,"The passage explicitly states that the differences in thermal images taken at night and day indicate that they may be caves. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Dipharologano tsa mogote (Differences in temperature)**
"
"Go elwa tlhoko jang, tsibogelo ya Seven Sisters go bo mogote fa bo ntse bo fetoga?","The correct answer is **B: Dikhuti tse di boteng**.

The passage states that the temperature variation in the ""Seven Sisters"" caves is similar to that of ""mesima e e boteng e e fa fatshe"" (deep underground pits), indicating that their response to temperature changes is likened to deep pits.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mafoko afe ka mmelaelwa, a e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **D: O ne a sa gobala**.

Here's why:

*   **P: Ga twe monna o ne a kgweetsa koloi ya maotwana a mararo a rwele dithunyi mo teng ga setlhopha sa batho.** This indicates the man used a vehicle. So, A is true.

*   **P: Monna yo o neng a belaelwa go re ke ene a thuntshitseng bomo o ne a tshwarwa** The passage says the man is suspected of detonating the bomb. So B is true.

*   **P: Leina la gagwe le santse le sa itsiwe go bamolao, le fa gone ba itse go re ke leloko la setlhopha sa morafe wa Uighur.** The passage states that authorities know his ethnic group. So, C is true.

*   **P: morago ga go re a gobale fa bomo e ne e thunya.** The passage states the man was injured when the bomb exploded. Therefore, D is false."
Ke tshedimosetso efe tebang le tlhaselo e e tlhomamisitsweng ke balaodi?,"The correct answer is **B: Lotso lwa mmelaelwa**

The passage states ""ba itse go re ke leloko la setlhopha sa morafe wa Uighur,"" which confirms the ethnicity of the suspect.  The other options are not confirmed in the passage.
"
Ke ditlhopha dife tse di tla tshamekang mo motshamekong kwa Ellis Park?,"The correct answer is **C: Aforika Borwa le Australia**.

The passage states: ""Motshameko wa bofelo wa di series o tla diragala ko lebaleng la metshameko la Ellis Park ko Johannesburg beke e e latelang, fa setlhopha sa Springbok se tla bo se tshameka le sa Australia.""
"
Di-Springbok di tla tshameka neng motshameko wa tsone o o latelang?,"The correct answer is **C: Johannesburg**.

The passage states: ""Motshameko wa bofelo wa di series o tla diragala ko lebaleng la metshameko la Ellis Park ko Johannesburg beke e e latelang, fa setlhopha sa Springbok se tla bo se tshameka le sa Australia.""
"
Ke sefe sa tse di latelang tse seteišene sa lefaufau se kgaratlhileng ka sone ka nako ya letsholo?,"The correct answer is **D: Go bona gape, boikutlo jo bo tlwaelegileng (Regaining normal orientation).**

Here's why:

* The passage states ""seriti sa seteishene se ile sa bowa"" which translates to ""the station's orientation returned."" This directly implies the station had lost its normal orientation and struggled to regain it.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: Tshola sekgala se se siameng go tswa kwa didirisweng tsa go laola tsibogo mo difofela loaping (Maintain a safe distance from the reaction control thrusters)** While the astronauts maintaining distance from the thrusters is mentioned, it's not what the station *struggled* with; it was a safety measure taken *because* of the orientation problem.
*   **B: Go nna le gyroscope (Having a gyroscope)** The passage does not mention gyroscopes.
*   **C: Go tlhosetsa jete (Firing jets)** Firing of the jets wasn't the struggle, but the outcome of the actions taken to correct the orientation problem.
"
"Go ya ka temana, mokgele wa letsholo la seteišene sa lefaufau e ne e le eng?","The correct answer is **C: Go konosetsa tsamao mo lefaufaung.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Taolo ya difofane e fa fatshe ya Russia e ile ya gologanya difofane mme seriti sa seteishene se ile sa bowa."" This translates to ""Russian ground flight control locked the aircraft and the station's gravity returned."" This indicates the goal was to regain control of the station's movement/trajectory.
"
"Ke afe a mafoko a a latelang, ka kgetse, a e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **D: AOL e ne e bonwa molato**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the lawsuit was influenced by AOL, which is a major ISP. However, it doesn't say that AOL was found guilty of anything. Rather, the case involves the law regarding unsolicited emails (spam) and unauthorized senders, and it's the first conviction using that law since it was enacted."
"Ke afe a mafoko a a latelang, a a tlhalosang kgetse ka nepagalo?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **B: Kgetse e ne e ama batlamedi ba babedi, ba ba itlhomileng kwa pele ba ditirelo tsa inthanetse**.

Fa re sekaseka ditemana:

*   **Temana e re bolelela gore kgetse e ne ya sekiwa kwa Virginia ka gonne e le legae la AOL.** Seno se supa gore AOL e ne e amega mo kgetsing eo.
*   **Temana gape e tlhalosa AOL jaaka ""batlamedi ba mafaratlhatlha a inthanete ba maemo a a kwa pele.""**
*   **Ga go na polelo ya gore AOL e bonwe molato.**
*   **Ga go na polelo ya gore kgetse e ne ya sekiwa ka 2003, mme fela go re molao o dirisitsweng o simolotse go dirisiwa ka 2003.**
*   **Temana ga e tlhalose gore ke mang yo o simolotseng tsheko ya kgetse, mme e fela e re kgetse e ne ya sekiwa.**

Ka jalo, karabo e e nepagetseng ke B."
"Go ya ka temana, Vidal o ne a simolola go tshamekela setlhopha sefe dipaka di le tharo tse di fetileng?","The correct answer is **A: Sevilla**.

The passage states that Vidal joined Barca from Sevilla three seasons ago.
"
Vidal o tshameketse Barça metshameko e le mekae?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**

The passage explicitly states: ""Fa a sale a fudugela kwa moshateng wa ma-Catalan, Vidal o tshameketse setlhopha se makgetho a le 49."" (Since moving to the Catalan palace, Vidal has played for the team 49 times.)
"
Ke bomang ba e leng setlhopha se se emang kgatlhanong mo motshamekong?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**.

The passage states that the match was scheduled to be played on Monday against Bolonia.
"
Goreng Jarque a ne a nna mo hoteleng?,"The correct answer is **B: O ne a na le kopano ya pele ga paka**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Jarque stayed at the team hotel ""before the game scheduled to take place on Monday against Bologna."" This indicates he was there as part of preparations for that game.
* **Therefore:** Staying at the hotel with the team before a game is a typical part of pre-season preparations.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: O ne a ikatisa:** While he did train in the morning, that isn't why he was staying at the hotel.
* **C: O ne a tshameka ka Sontaga:** The game was on Monday, not Sunday.
* **D: O ne a ikatisa le Bolonia:** The passage suggests that the game was against Bologna, not training with them.
"
Goreng setlamo sa thutafatshe sa Jakarta se ne se sa batle go ntsha tsiboso?,"The correct answer is **D: E ne e sa fitlhelele bogolo bo bo lekaneng go nna thoromo ya lefatshe**.

The passage explicitly states that the agency didn't issue a tsunami warning because the earthquake didn't reach the required magnitude of 6.5.  The other options are not directly supported by the text.
"
"Go ya ka temana, thoromo ya lefatshe e bakile eng?","The correct answer is **A: Baagi ba selegae ba ba tshogileng**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that even though there was no tsunami warning, ""baagi ba ile ba simolola go etsaetsega mme ba simolola go sia dikgwebo le matlo a bone"" (residents became alarmed and started fleeing their businesses and homes). This clearly indicates that the earthquake caused alarm among the local residents.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Matshosetsi a tsunami** - The passage explicitly states there were no tsunami threats.
* **C: Tsiboso e e ntshitsweng** - The passage explicitly states that no warning was issued.
* **D: 6.5 mo selekanyong sa bogolo ba thoromo ya lefatshe** - This is a threshold that needs to be reached for a tsunami warning to be issued, but the passage doesn't explicitly say that the earthquake reached that magnitude. It just states that it didn't meet the threshold, implying it was lower than 6.5. Moreover, this is not a *result* of the earthquake, but rather a *measurement* related to it.
"
Ke efe ya tseno e e tlhotlheletsang tiro ya Letsatsi le dinaledi tse dingwe tsotlhe?,"The passage states: ""Tiro ya dinaledi tsotlhe mo loaping go lemogilwe go re e dirwa ke ka fa di ntshang **lesedi** ka teng le go **dikologa** fela."" Dikologa refers to plasma flow. Then later it says: ""Fa nomoro ya Rossby e le nnye, go supa go re naledi e a bo e se na phapaano di-magnetic poles e e kwa godimo."" This implies Rossby number also influences activity.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Lesedi, nomoro ya Rossby, le thefosano** (Lesedi, Rossby number, and circulation/flow).
"
Nomoro ya Rossby ya naledi e tlhomamisiwa jang?,"The correct answer is **A: Lesedi le thefosano**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Go phatsima le go dikologa di dirisiwa mmogo thata go bona palo ya naledi ya Rossby"" which translates to ""Brightness and rotation are used together to find the Rossby number of a star.""  ""Go phatsima"" (brightness) relates to ""lesedi"" (light) and ""go dikologa"" (rotation) relates to ""thefosano"" (rotation).
"
Ke peresente efe ya batho ba ba neng ba botsolodiwa e e reng Australia e nne rephaboliki ka bonako?,"The correct answer is **B: Diperesente di le 29**.

The passage states: ""Fa go tshwantshanngwe maikutlo a batho, 29% ya bone ba dumela go re Australia e tshwanetse go nna rephaboliki mo nakong e e sa fediseng pelo..."" This directly answers the question.
"
"Go ya ka Julie Gillard, Australia e tshwanetse e nne rephaboliki neng?","The correct answer is **B: Morago ga puso ya Kgosigadi Elizabeth II**.

The passage states that Julia Gillard said Australia should become a republic ""fa paka ya ga Mmamosadinyana (Elizabeth II) e wela"" which translates to ""when the reign of the Queen (Elizabeth II) ends"".
"
Ke mokgatlho ofe o o leng ka fa tlase ga diotso-patlisiso tsa molao?,"The correct answer is **C: Botsadi bo bo ipaakanyeditsweng**.

The passage states that the Komen Foundation withheld funding from Planned Parenthood due to an investigation into how Planned Parenthood uses its funds.
"
Cliff Stearns ke tlhogo ya komiti efe?,"The correct answer is **D: Komitipotlana ya Bookamedi le Dipatlisiso**.

The passage states: ""Stearns o batlisisa go re a madi a lekgetho ke one a dirisiwang go duelela go senngwa ga dimpa ke Planned Parenthood mo seemong sa gagwe jaaka modulasetulo wa mokgatlho wa **Komitipotlana e e Okamelang Dipatlisiso**..."".
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng seo se sa diragalelang mosadi wa kwa Switzerland?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **B: O bolailwe**.

Ga go na sepe mo temaneng se se supang gore mosadi wa Switzerland o bolailwe. Dintlha tse dingwe tsotlhe di boammaaruri go ya ka temana.
"
Ke setheo sefe se se abetsweng Taiwan Sustainable Award ka 2007?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The passage explicitly states that ""mmaraka wa di-laptop o ya go tetolwa thata morago ga ASUS e fiwa sekgele sa Taiwan Sustainable Award sa 2007"".
"
ASUS Eee PC ke eng?,"Karabo e nepahetseng ke **B: Lepothopo**.

Polelo e hlakisa hore ASUS Eee PC e amehile ho fokotsa litšenyehelo tsa li-laptop, e bontšang hore ke mofuta oa laptop.
"
Ke mang a neng a rwele maikarabelo a ditokomane tse di latlhegileng tsa poso?,"The correct answer is **C: Mosimane**.

The passage states that the post office apologized after realizing that ""mosimane mongwe o ne a fitlhile ditokumente di ka nna 600 tsa poso."" (a boy had hidden about 600 postal documents).
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mang a kopileng boitshwarelo tebang le ditokomane tse di timetseng?","The correct answer is **D: Kantoro ya poso ya Obanazawa**.

The passage states: ""Maabane, ba poso ba ntshitse lekwalo la go kopa maitshwarelo mo baageding le mo mmedieng..."" which translates to ""Yesterday, the post office issued a letter of apology to the residents and the media..."" This clearly indicates the Obanazawa post office apologized.
"
Del Potro o ne a tlhoka go mekamekana le kgang ya gagwe ya legetla neng?,"Karabo e nepahetseng ke **C: Mo seteng ya bobedi**.

Polelo e re: ""Del Potro o ne a alafelwa legetla mme ka nako eno mme a kgona go boela mo motshamekong,"" mme se se diragetse mo seteng ya bobedi, jaaka go tlhalositswe gore Del Potro o ne a na le ketelo pele mo seteng ya bobedi."
Dipoelo tsa kgaisano ya ntlha ya go tlhomamisa mofenyi?,"The correct answer is **D: E ne ya fenngwa ke Del Potro mo seteng ya bobedi.**

Here's why:

* The passage states ""Del Potro o ne a na le ketelo pele mo legatong la bobedi"" (Del Potro had a lead in the second set) and that they needed a tie-breaker after reaching 6-6. The fact that Murray lost after being tied implies Del Potro won the tie-breaker and thus the set. The text indicates Del Potro's injury occurred in the second set so, he won in the set, after the injury.
"
"Jaaka go tlhalositswe mo temaneng,ke mang,segolobogolo, yo o neng a amana le molwetse ?","The correct answer is **B: Bana**.

The passage states: ""Gompieno, re ithutile gore bana bangwe ba ba leng mo dingwageng tsa go tsena sekolo ba supilwe e le ba ba kopaneng le molwetse"" which translates to ""Today, we learned that some school-aged children have been identified as having been in contact with the patient.""
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke netefaletso efe e mmusi a sa e dirang fa a ne a bua le banni ba kwa Texas?","The correct answer is **D: Kgetse ga e masisi**.

The passage states that Perry said, ""kgetse e e masisi"" (the case is serious). Therefore, he did *not* assure the residents that the case wasn't serious. The other options are all affirmations he made.
"
"Ke motswedi ofe wa kakgelo ya metlae, e e neng ya tlhangwa ke baithuti ba pele ba UW, ba le babedi?","The correct answer is **D: The Onion**.

The passage states that Heck and Johnson, while students at UW in 1988, conceived of a publication that would revolutionize news reporting. That publication is identified as ""The Onion.""
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya tseno, e e sa akarediwang mo teng ga kgwebo e kgolo ya kakgelo ya metlae ya The Onion?","The correct answer is **B: Filimi**.

The passage mentions:

*   **Kgatiso e e gatisitsweng (D):** ""kgatiso-kwalo""
*   **Webosaete (C):** ""tsebe ya inthanete""
*   **Pontsho ya mmapa wa lefatshe (A):** ""bukana ya lefatshe e e bidiwang Our Dumb Word""

Filimi ga e umakiwe gope mo temaneng."
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo se neng se letetswe ke mapodise?","The correct answer is **C: Matseno a Downing Street**.

The passage states that the protest started at Whitehall facing the police-guarded entrance to Downing Street. While the protest later moved towards the Grand Connaught Rooms, the initial focus was Downing Street.
"
Mapodise a ne a kopa badiraditshupetso ka nako mang gore ba sute go tila go oketsega ga pharakano go ya pele?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka 11:20**

The text states: ""Ka nako ya 11:20, mapodise a ne a kopa babopeledi go sutela fa godimo ga bodilo jwa letlhakore la tsela...""
"
Ke eng se e leng nnete ka dipatlisiso tse di dirilweng ke Dr. Ehud Ur?,"The correct answer is **B: Dipeba tse dingwe tse di neng di na le bolwetse ba sukiri ga di sa na bona**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""O tladitse a re, jaanong re na le dipeba tsa dikgwedi tse 4, tse di senang bolwetse jwa sukiri mme di kile tsa bo di na le jone."" This translates to ""He added that, now we have 4-month-old mice that do not have diabetes but once had it.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dipholo di ka nna mosola go balwetse ba bolwetse ba sukiri ba Type 1 bo neng bo ntse bo le teng:** The passage states the opposite: ""...go re diphitlhelelo tseno ga di amane ka gope le batho ba ba nang le sukiri ya Type 1.""
*   **C: O na le tsholofelo ya gore diphitlhelelo di ka tlisa kalafi:** The passage says Dr. Ur ""o na le dipelaelo tsa go re a bolwetse jwa sukiri bo a alafega,"" meaning he has doubts about a cure.
*   **D: Dipeba dingwe tse di neng di se nang bolwetse jwa sukiri, jaanong di na le bone:** The passage states the opposite, mice no longer have diabetes."
"Go ya ka temana, Dr Ur o belaela ka eng?","The correct answer is **A: Fa diphitlhelelo di le maleba go batho ba ba nang le bolwetse jwa sukiri jwa Type 1**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...diphitlhelelo tseno ga di amane ka gope le batho ba ba nang le sukiri ya Type 1."" Dr. Ur is therefore doubtful about the relevance of these findings to humans with Type 1 diabetes.

"Ke afe a mafoko a a latelang, a a sa tlhaloseng ka nepagalo,thubagano ya Flight CG4684?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **C: Sefofane se lekile go kotama gararo pele se thubagana**.

Ntlha e e reng sefofane se lekile go kotama gangwe fela pele se thubagana. E ne e leka go kotama lwa bobedi fa e ne e nyelela. Ga go na bosupi bope jwa gore se lekile go kotama gararo. Mafoko a mangwe a mararo a kaya dilo tse di neng di boleletswe mo mafokong.
"
Ke eng se se bakileng gore Flight CG4684 e emise go kotama?,"The correct answer is **D: Maemo a bosa a ne a le bokoa** (The weather conditions were poor).

The passage states: ""The Twin Otter sale e ntse e leka go kotama kwa Kokoda maabane fa difofane tsa PNG Flight CG4684, mme e setse e tlogetse gangwe."" which indicates that the Flight CG4684 attempted to land in Kokoda yesterday but it already tried once and left.
Also, the passage states: ""Patlo e ile ya kgorelediwa ke seemo se se tshwanang se se sa siamang sa bosa se se bakileng go re sefofane se tlogele go kotama."" which directly translates to ""The search was hampered by the same bad weather conditions that caused the plane to abandon landing.""

Therefore, poor weather conditions caused the flight to abandon landing.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke afe a mafoko a a latelang ka se se diragaletseng Franciszek Kowal a e leng nnete?","The correct answer is **B: Mo bofelong, o ne a sa gobala** (In the end, he was unharmed).

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Ka lesego ga gona sepe se se ntiragaletseng..."" which translates to ""Luckily nothing happened to me..."". This indicates Franciszek Kowal was not injured during the incident.
*   The passage mentions Franciszek Kowal being a survivor, confirming that he was not harmed.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: O kgonne go thuba letlhabaphefo:** While the passage mentions someone breaking a window, it doesn't specifically state that Franciszek Kowal was the one who broke it.
*   **C: O robile setulo fa a ne a leka go tswa:** While chairs were used to break the window, there is no indication that Franciszek Kowal broke a chair while trying to escape.
*   **D: O ne a gobale fa a leka go thuba letlhabaphefo:** The passage states that ""Luckily nothing happened to me,"" indicating that Franciszek Kowal was not injured.
"
Goreng go le thata go lekanya ditlamorago tse di ka nnang teng tsa Letsubutsubu la Danielle?,"The correct answer is **C: Letsubutsubu le kgakala le lefatshe le le fetang kwa godimo ga lone.**

The passage states, ""E re ka setsuatsue se le kgakala le go goroga mo lefatsheng, ga go bonolo go ka sekaseka go re ditlamorago tsa sone di tla nna jang mo lefatsheng la Amerika kgotsa kwa Caribbean."" This directly translates to: ""Because the storm is far from making landfall, it is not easy to assess what its impacts will be on the American mainland or in the Caribbean.""
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke afe a mafoko a a latelang, a e seng nnete, ka Letsubutsubu la Danielle?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **D: Le gaufi le lefatshe le le fetang fa godimo ga lone**.

*   **B:** Temana e bolela sentle gore letsubutsubu le ipopile kwa botlhabatsatsi jwa lewatle la Atlantic, se se dirang gore polelo e e bo e le nnete.

"Go ya ka temana, go tshitshinngwa gore go diragale eng ka bolwetse pele bo baka leroborobo la lefatshe lotlhe?","The correct answer is **A: E tshwanetse e nne e e seng kotsi thata**.

The passage states: ""Dithutopatlisiso tse dingwe di re gakolola go re bolwetse jono bo tshwanetse bo fokotsege borai pele bo ka kaiwa e le bolwetse jwa leroborobo jwa lefatshe ka bophara."" This directly translates to ""Other research reminds us that the disease must decrease in severity before it can be declared a global pandemic."" Therefore, for the disease to become a global pandemic, it must be less dangerous.
"
"Go ya ka temana, letsubutsubu le ne le le bokgakala jo bo kana kang go tswa kwa Fujian?","The correct answer is **C: Dikhilomitara di le 70**

The passage states: ""leitlho la Morakot le ne le ka nna bokgakala jwa dikhilomithara di le masome-a-supa go tswa porofenseng ya China ya Fuijan.""
"
Ke mang yo a neng a dumedisa George W. Bush fa a goroga kwa Asia?,"The correct answer is **D: Motlatsa Tonakgolo**.

The passage states: ""O ne a dumedisiwa ke mothusa Tonakgolo wa Singapore e leng Wong Kan Seng...""  While Wong Kan Seng is named, the key is that he is described as the Deputy Prime Minister (Mothusa Tonakgolo).
"
Moporesidente o buile neng ka katoloso ya kgwebisano ya Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Fa morago ga go latlhegelwa ke ditlhopho tsa paka ya magareng**.

The passage states, ""Morago ga go ya go latlhegelwa ke ditlhopho, Bush o ile a bolelela babogedi ka katoloso ya papadisanyo kwa Asia."" This translates to ""After losing the elections, Bush told the audience about the expansion of trade in Asia.""
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang e leng mokgele wa konokono wa puso?","The correct answer is **D: Fokotsa lesukasuke mo dikoloing tsa dipitse**.

The passage states that the purpose of adding the horse-drawn carriages is ""go fokotsa mosuke"" which translates to ""to reduce congestion"". Therefore, reducing congestion is the government's main goal.
"
Puso e itsisitse eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba rulaganya go tlamela ka matlole, dikoloi tse dingwe gape tsa dipitse di le 300**.

The passage states: ""Go tlatsa ka tse 300 go tla oketsa palo yotlhe ya dikara go nna 1300...""  This means the government is planning to add 300 more horse-drawn carriages.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke tshedimosetso efe e e itsiweng?","The correct answer is **A: Selekanyo sa matshosetsi se fokotsegile**.

The passage states that ""phokotsego ya matshosetsi go nna selekanyo se se tseneletseng"" which translates to ""the reduction of threats to a significant level."" This directly indicates a decrease in the threat level.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Ga go sa na matshosetsi ape** is directly contradicted by the passage, which states that ""matshosetsi otlhe a tsamaile"" (all threats have gone).
*   **C: Tlhaselo e lebeletswe** is also contradicted; the passage says there's ""no intelligence to suggest an imminent attack.""
*   **D: Ba tsa Matlhale ba tlhomamisitse gore tlhaselo e tsile go nna masisi** is not supported by the passage. The passage says the opposite: there's no intelligence of an imminent attack."
"Ke polelo efe tebang le ditshupetso, e e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **C: Ditshupetso di ne di batla gore CEP wa pele a role tiro.**

Here's why:

*   **A: Khomišine ya moporesidente e ne e le tsibogo go ditshupetso** - This is true. The passage explicitly states the commission was a response to anti-government protests.
*   **B: Ditlhopho tse di diegileng, di tsositse ditshupetso** - This is true. The passage mentions the protests were ""tlhotlhelediwa ke go palelwa ke go tshwara ditlhopho"" (influenced by the failure to hold elections).
*   **D: Ditshupetso di ne di na le tirisodikgoka ka dinako dingwe** - This is true. The passage mentions ""Ditshupetso tse ka dinako dingwe di nang le tirisodikgoka"" (Protests that sometimes have violence).
*   **C: Ditshupetso di ne di batla gore CEP wa pele a role tiro** - This is not explicitly mentioned in the passage. While the commission recommended the CEP resign, the passage doesn't state that this was a *demand* of the protesters. The protests were more generally against the government and the lack of elections. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true."
Ke mang a tshitshintseng gore CEP ya bofelo e role tiro?,"The correct answer is **C: Khomišene ya moporesidente**.

The passage states: ""Kgwedi e e fetileng komishene ya boporesidente e ne ya atlanegisa go re di-CEP di role tiro pele..."" which translates to ""Last month the presidential commission agreed that the CEPs should resign...""
"
"Go ya ka temana,Ke eng seo lekgotla la USA Gymnastics le sa dumalaneng le sone, morago ga gore Nassar a kgokgontshe batshameki?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Go tlosa leina le o bidiwang ka lone semmuso**.

The passage states that the USA Gymnastics board agrees that the interests of athletes are better served by moving forward with appropriate change within the organization, *rather than decertification*. Decertification would essentially be removing their official name and recognition. All the other options (B, C, and D) are things that the USA Gymnastics board *supports*, according to the passage.
"
"Go ya ka polelo,ke eng maikaelelomagolo a USA Gymnastics gammogo le Komiti ya Di-Olimpiki ya Amerika go ya pele?","The correct answer is **D: Go tsweletsa tikologo e e sireletsegileng ya batshameki.**

The passage explicitly states that USA Gymnastics agrees with the US Olympic Committee on the importance of promoting a safe environment for all athletes.
"
Sekepe se ne se ya kae fa tiragalo e diragala? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palawan**.

The passage states ""...sekepe sa teng se ne se le mo tseleng go ya Puerto Princesa ko **Palawan**.""
"
Ke eng se e seng boammaaruri tebang le sekepe se se umakilweng mo temaneng?,"The correct answer is **B: E kwa Palawan**.

The passage states the ship was *en route* to Puerto Princesa in Palawan, meaning it was **traveling to** Palawan, not that it was *already* there. The other statements are explicitly supported by the passage:

*   **A: E ne e le mo tseleng ya go ya Puerto Princesa:** The passage states ""...sekepe sa teng se ne se le mo tseleng go ya Puerto Princesa ko Palawan.""
*   **C: Ke sekepe sa moepo sa go thibela bothata bo bo ka tlhagang:** The passage states ""Sekepe sa mofuta wa Avenger sa tshwantsho dibomo te di epetsweng..."" which means it is a minesweeper.
*   **D: E abetswe Seventh Fleet ya masole a lewatle a U.S.:** The passage states ""E neetswe Setlhopha sa Bosupa sa Masole a Lewatle a Amerika..."""
Ke mang a neng a neelana ka polelo tebang le masole a ntwa a US?,"The correct answer is **D: Mokwaledi wa metswedi ya dikgang**.

The passage states ""tautona wa lefatshe la United States, Donald Trump mo pegong e ntshitsweng ke mokwaledi wa bobegadikgang..."" meaning Donald Trump made the announcement in a statement *released* by the press secretary. Thus, the press secretary delivered the statement.
"
"Go ya ka polelo, ke naga efe e e rweleng maikarabelo a go disa batlhabani ba ba tshwerweng?","The correct answer is **D: Turkey**.

The passage states: ""Mo godimo ga moo, Turkey e tla tsaya maikarabelo a tlhokomelo ya batshwarwa ba batlhabani ba ISIS..."" which translates to ""Furthermore, Turkey will take responsibility for the care of the captured ISIS fighters...""
"
Ke eng se go dumelwang gore se bakile kgosomano?,"The correct answer is **B: Molelo o o sa laolegeng**.

The passage states: ""Thulano e diragetse kwa godimo mo dithabeng, go dumelwa go re e bakilwe ke molelo o o bogale."" (The clash occurred high in the mountains, believed to be caused by an intense fire.)
"
Kgosomano e diragetse mo karolong ya mofuta ofe?,"The correct answer is **D: Le le dithaba**.

The passage states: ""Thulano e diragetse kwa godimo mo dithabeng...""  This directly indicates that the conflict happened in a mountainous region.
"
Batlhankedi ba ne ba solofela eng ka ntlha ya morwalela?,"The correct answer is **A: Go tsosoloswa ga dithotobolo tsa motlhaba**.

The passage states: ""Le fa gone metsi a ka oketsega go se kae morago ga morwalela, badiredi ba solofela go re a tla bo a lekane go tsosolosa moshawa o o gogotsweng kwa tlasenyana."" This directly indicates the officials' hope of restoring sandbars downstream due to the increased water flow.
"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, tse di amilweng ke kago ya letamo, go ya go ile?","The correct answer is **B: Humpback chubs**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the humpback chub is one of the fish species that has been harmed due to the dam.

Let's look at why the other options are not the MOST direct and complete answer:

*   **A: Dithotobolo tsa motlhaba** - The text mentions these were constructed, implying an action *taken because of* the dam, not directly *affected by* the dam in a negative sense. The passage states that dams have allowed the creation of these sandbars, which are intended to help wildlife. This implies that they have been helpful, not harmful.

*   **C: Bonno ba diphologolo tsa naga** - It's indirectly affected because the sandbars, which help the animals' habitat, were a response to the dam's effects. While the initial disruption of the natural river flow affected the ecosystem (including habitats), the dam's creation *prompted* the building of the sandbars.

*   **D: Go anama ga seretse** - The passage directly states that the seasonal floods that spread sediment were stopped by the dam, therefore this IS affected by the dam.

Therefore, the BEST answer is **B: Humpback chubs**, because the passage explicitly mentioned that they were negatively impacted by the dam, which is a more direct and undeniable effect. While the dam also impacted the spread of silt, this is a broad and less specific consequence than the explicit endangerment of the humpback chub."
"Go ya ka temana, ke mang a fileng Dinaga tse di Kopaneng, tshedimosetso ka tlhaselo e e ka nnang gone?","The correct answer is **C: Motswedi o o sa utololwang**.

The passage states: ""U.S. ya re e amogetse tshedimosetso go tswa go **motswedi o o sa utololwang** o tlhalosa ka go tloba go dirisiwa ga baipolai ka bomo ba ba ikaeletseng go phatlakanya """"mafelo a konokono"""" kwa Ithiopia le Kenya.""
"
"Ke efe ya dipolelo tse di latelang, e e tlhalosang ka nepagalo,se go tweng ke leano la tlhaselo la bafeteletsa dilo?","The correct answer is **C: Phatlakanya dibomo kwa mafelong a konokono mo dinageng di le pedi**.

The passage states the extremists plan to detonate bombs at ""key locations"" in both Ethiopia and Kenya.
"
Ke ofe wa batho ba ba latelang yo e seng mmueledi?,"Let's analyze the passage:

*   **Petros Mantouvalos:** The passage states that he is ""leloko le la Palamente gape e le mmueledi"" (a member of Parliament and a lawyer).
*   **Sakis Kechagioglou le George Nikolakopoulos:** The passage identifies them as ""babueledi ba ba tumileng ba Greek"" (famous Greek lawyers).
*   **Makis Triantafylopoulos:** The passage identifies him as ""mmegadikgang Makis Triantafylopoulos"" (journalist Makis Triantafylopoulos).

Therefore, Makis Triantafylopoulos is the only one who is explicitly identified as a journalist and not a lawyer.

**So the correct answer is D: Makis Triantafylopoulos**
"
"Ke setlhopha sefe sa batho, se se sa umakiwang e le karolo ya matlhabisaditlhong mo teng ga setlhopha sa babueledi sa Bagerika?","The correct answer is **C: Babegadikgang**.

The passage mentions:

*   **Baatlhodi** (Evangelos Kalousis)
*   **Babueledi** (Petros Mantouvalos and Sakis Kechagioglou, George Nikolakopoulos)
*   **Ba ba ithutetseng molao, le diagente**

Babegadikgang (journalists) are not mentioned as being part of the scandal within the Greek legal community. Makis Triantafylopoulos, the journalist, exposed the wrongdoings, therefore, they are not involved in the scandal.
"
India e latlhegetswe ke metabogo e le mekae?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

The passage states ""morago ga go latlhegelwa ke captain's wicket India ba dira di-run di le 36 fela, ba latlhegelwa ke di-wicket di le supa, go feleletse di-innings.""  This clearly says India lost 7 wickets.
"
"Go ya ka temana,dintlha tse dintsi go feta tsa di- innings?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **A: Metabogo e le 70**

Temana e tlhalosa ka tlhamalalo gore Robbin Uthappa o kgonne go dira dintlha tse di kwa godimo ka metabogo e le 70. Ga go na dintlha tse dingwe tse di leng kwa godimo go feta 70 mo temaneng.
"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e seng yone e bakang go kgobega marapo ga Adam Cuerden?","The passage states Adam Cuerden's unhappiness stems from:

*   **Go phimolwa ga botaki ja gagwe (Go phimolwa ga botaki ke Wales):** Wales deleting his artwork.
*   **Maaka ka se se bakang go phimolwa ga botaki (Maaka ka se se bakang go phimolwa ga botaki):** Wales initially lying about the reasons for the deletions.
*   **Go sa reediwe ke Wales (Go sa reediwe ke Wales):** Wales pretending to listen to him.

The passage discusses a proposed policy regarding sexually explicit content, but doesn't directly link it to Cuerden's specific frustration. His frustration is tied to the deletion of *his* artwork and how Wales handled the situation.

Therefore, the answer is **A: Pholisi e ntšhwa tebang le go bontsha tlhakanelodikobo (A: Pholisi e ntšhwa tebang le go bontsha tlhakanelodikobo)** because the new policy is mentioned, but not explicitly tied to Adam's disappointment. The main focus of his disappointment is on the deletion of his art and the lies/lack of listening that surrounded it."
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo se phimotsweng mo webosaeteng?","The correct answer is **B: Go bontsha tlhakanelodikobo** (Go bontsha tlhakanelodikobo).

The passage states: ""Matshwenyego a sechaba a dirile go re go dirwe maiteko a go kwala molawana o itebagantseng le tsa thobalano tse di mo webosaeteng e"" which translates to: ""Public concerns have led to efforts to write a policy that addresses sexual content on the website."" This indicates that the content being removed or discussed concerns sexual content. Also, the passage says ""fitlhela go phimolwa botaki ja gagwe"" which translates to ""suddenly his artwork was removed"" which indicates **A** might be correct, however, the earlier statement relating to the policy that addresses sexual content is a stronger indicator that the correct answer is **B**."
"Go ya ka temana, ke dife tsa tse di latelang tseo Amir Khan a sa di tshegetseng?","The correct answer is **A: Go tsenyelediwa bommamabole mo Diolimpiking**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states Amir Khan didn't support ""tsenyeletso ya maemo a basadi"" which means the inclusion of women in sports/boxing. Option A is the closest one to that.
*   The passage also explicitly states he *would* support British competitors (B) and the London Olympics (D).
*   Option C is too vague; the text is about women in boxing, not women's ideas in general."
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang, e Amir Khan a e tshegetsang, go sa kgathalesege gore dikakanyo tsa gagwe ke eng?","The correct answer is **C: Diolimpiki tsa 2012**.

The passage states that despite his views on women's boxing, Amir Khan said he would support British competitors at the 2012 Olympics in London. Therefore, he is supporting the 2012 Olympics.
"
Peter Lenz o tlhokofetse neng?,"The correct answer is **C: Kwa bookelong**.

The passage states that Lenz was taken to a nearby hospital where he later died.
"
Ke mang Xavier Zayat?,"The correct answer is **B: Mogaisani yo mongwe**.

The text states that Peter Lenz was hit by fellow racer Xavier Zayat. Therefore, Xavier Zayat is another racer (Mogaisani yo mongwe).
"
"Ke mo seemong sefe, mo mopalami wa sefofane, yo o tshogileng,a ka nneng a sologelwa mosola ka go tlhaloganya bokafateng jwa sefofane?","The correct answer is **B: Fa go ila go fofa ga bone, go theilwe mo letshogong la tse di sa itseweng.**

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states:** ""Mo bathong bangwe, go tlhaloganya sengwe ka tsela e sefofane se berekang ka yone le se se diregang ka nako ya diphofu go ka thusa go fenya poifo e e ikaegileng ka dilo tse di sa itsegeng kgotsa go sa nne mo taolong."" This directly connects understanding how airplanes work to overcoming fear based on the unknown.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Fa mopalami a tlhabiswa ditlhong ke letshogo la gagwe:** While shame related to fear might be present, the passage doesn't suggest understanding the mechanics of flight is a direct solution to shame.
*   **C: Fa mopalami a sa itumedisiwe ke mefuta yotlhe ya dipalangwa:** General dislike of transportation isn't specifically addressed by the passage. The passage focuses on the *specific* fear of flying.
*   **D: Fa letshogo la bone le tswa kwa ditiragalong tse di utlwisang botlhoko, tse di sa amaneng le go fofa:** If the fear stems from unrelated traumatic events, understanding the mechanics of flight is unlikely to be the primary solution. Therapy or addressing the root trauma would be more appropriate.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke sefe sa tse di latelang se mosepedi yo o nang le kitso ka ditlhwatlhwa, a tshwanetseng go se dira labofelo?","The correct answer is **B: Beeletsa ka tlhamalalo le ditirelo tsa diphofo**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...go solegela molemo go bapisa dipholo tsa patlo le go leba webosaete ya ditirelo tsa sefofane ka boyone *pele* o dira peeletso."" This means checking the airline's website is the *last* step before booking. Booking directly with the airline is a way to take advantage of the airline website.
* **Other Options:**
    * **A: Batla tse ditheo tsa mosepele tse dintsi di se kgothaletsang**: This is something that should happen much earlier in the process.
    * **C: Bapisa dituelo magareng ga ditheo tse dintsi tsa mesepele**: This is a crucial step, but the passage suggests it happens *before* checking the airline's website.
    * **D: Tlhola webosaete ya boemafofane**: The passage refers to ""ditirelo tsa sefofane"", not ""boemafofane."" Ditirelo tsa sefofane are airline services/companies.
"
"Go ya ka temana, batsamai ba tshwanetse go dira eng pele go bona ditlhwatlhwa tse di gaisang tsotlhe, tsa go fofa?","The correct answer is **B: Bapisa ditlhwatlhwa magareng ga mefuta ya ba ba dirang palogare**.

The passage explicitly states that taking a plane trip is rarely booked directly with airline services without first searching and comparing prices. It also suggests comparing search results across different agencies and checking the airline website itself before booking. This aligns perfectly with option B, which emphasizes comparing prices among different aggregators.
"
Ke neng fa molekane a tlhokang go pata tsamaiso?,"Kgang e supa gore molao wa difofane ga o letle gore dithoto di romelwe ntle le mopalami, fa di romelwa jaaka dithoto tse di lebilweng. Ka jalo, karabo e e nepagetseng ke:

**C: Fa dilo di romelwa jaaka morwalo yo o kwadisitsweng**
"
"Go ya ka temana,fa o tlhopha tirelo ya difofane ya Frequent Flyer e e mo kgolaganong,ke efe ya tse di latelang e e tshwanetseng go nna ditlapele?","The passage advises to choose a Frequent Flyer program carefully, and to consider that benefits and rewards can be less valuable than those of other alliances. It doesn't explicitly recommend prioritizing any of the options A, B, or C. However, it *does* suggest focusing on the value of the benefits offered, even if you fly with a specific airline often.

Therefore, the best answer is **D: Tirelo ya difofane e e ka bong e tsenya ditshiamelo tse di oketsegileng**.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mang a ka neelang dintlha tse dintsi tsa frequent flyer?","Karabo e nepahetseng ke **A: Tirelo e nngwe ya difofane, mo kgolaganong e nngwe**.

Temana e bontsha gore le fa o fofisa sefofane se le sengwe gantsi, ditshiamelo le dituelo tsa sone di ka nna tsa se ka tsa tshwana le tsa difofane tse dingwe mo dikgolaganong tse dingwe. Se se kaya gore sefofane se sengwe mo kgolaganong e nngwe se ka nna sa go fa dintlha tse dintsi.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya ditemosi tse di latelang, tse di ka kgorelediwang ke go nwa nnotagi thata?","The correct answer is **B: Pono**.

The text specifically mentions that excessive alcohol consumption can lead to:

*   **Bofofu (blindness)**
The text also mentions that illegally produced alcohol contains methanol, which can also lead to blindness or death.

While alcohol abuse can affect other senses indirectly, the text directly links it to potential vision impairment.
"
"Jaaka go tlhalositswe mo temaneng, ke eng se se kgonang go fokotsa ditlamorago tse di kotsi tsa bojalwa?","The correct answer is **C: Go nwa bojalwa ka tekanyetso**.

The paragraph explicitly states ""Nwang bojalwa ka tekanyetso"" and that knowing your limit is important, implying moderation helps mitigate harm. The other options directly contradict the information in the passage about the dangers of excessive and illegally produced alcohol.
"
Ke kae moo tlhwatlhwa ya ditsha e leng magareng ga tse di kwa godimo go gaisa mo Amsterdam?,"The correct answer is **A: Kgaolo ya Canal**.

The passage explicitly states that ""ditlhwatlhwa tsa ditsha teng ke dingwe tsa tse di kwa godimo ga gaisa mo nageng"" (land prices there are among the highest in the country) in reference to the Canal District.
"
Goreng Kgaolo ya Canal e beetswe thoko go nna Lefelo la Ngwao la Lefatshe la UNESCO?,"The correct answer is **A: Boleng ba kwa re tswang le setso** and **B: Dilo tsa yone tse di tlhomologileng**

The passage states that the Canal District was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to its ""setso se se kgethegileng le boleng jwa ditso"" which translates to ""exceptional cultural and historical value"". This directly aligns with options A and B.

The passage also implies that the reason for being a UNESCO World Heritage Site is its exceptional cultural and historical value. The other reasons are merely descriptions of the Canal District.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e dirang gore go etela Phnom Krom go go tswele molemo?","The passage states: ""Loapi le le sa apogang la tempele, le tubego ya lecha la Tonle Sap go dira go oketsa serodumo sa go pagama thota e."" This means that the clear view from the temple, especially the view of the Tonle Sap lake, makes the climb worthwhile.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Se o se bonang fa o le godimo ga Tonle Sap**
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se se tlhokegang gore baeng ba tsene kwa Phnom Krom?","The correct answer is **C: Go bona Angkor Pass**.

The passage states: ""Teseletso ya Angkor Pass e a tlhokafala fa o batla go tsena mo tempeleng e..."" (An Angkor Pass is required if you want to enter the temple...).
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e neng e ka thibela mojanala gore a se etele Antarctica?","The correct answer is **D: Tsamaiso ya mmele e e lekanyeditsweng (A limited physical system)**

Here's why:

*   **P: Antarctica ke lefelo le le tsididi go gaisa mo Lefatsheng. ... Maeto a bojanala a tlhwatlhwa godimo, a tlhoka boitekanelo mo mmeleng, e bile go ka etiwa fela ka selemo mo kgweding tsa Ngwanatsele go fitlha go Tlhakole...**
    This part of the text explicitly states that the trips ""tlhoka boitekanelo mo mmeleng (require physical fitness)"". Thus a limited physical system (tsamaiso ya mmele e e lekanyeditsweng) would hinder one from being able to do the trip.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: Tlhwatlhwa godimo ya maeto a bojanala (The high price of tourist travel)** While the high cost is a factor, it's not a *prohibitive* factor in the same way physical limitations would be. Someone could theoretically save up and afford it.
*   **B: Kgatlhego e le yosi, ya go tlhotlhomisa Lewatle la Ross (The sole interest in exploring the Ross Sea)** The text mentions the Ross Sea as a destination. Having that interest wouldn't *prevent* a visit.
*   **C: Lenaneo la tiro le le kgontshang mosepele ka Sedimonthole le Ferikgong (A work schedule that allows travel in December and January)** The text states that trips are available in Ngwanatsele to Tlhakole which is the summer months. A work schedule that allows travel in December (Sedimonthole) and January (Ferikgong) would make travel *possible*, not prevent it."
Mojanala yo o kgatlhegelang go palama dithaba a ka nne a etela karolo efe ya Antartica?,"The passage states: ""Go a tle go nne le maeto a bojanala a difofane a a tsenelelang mo bogareng, go ya go palama dithaba..."". This translates to: ""There are occasionally tourist flights that go deep into the interior, to go mountain climbing..."".

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: Lefelo le mo gare ga lefatshe (Lefelo le mo gare ga lefatshe means The interior of the country, which in this case is Antarctica)**
"
Ke kae moo lefelo la tshekatsheko ya loapi le dinaledi la pele le ka se nne gone thata?,"The correct answer is **C: Kwa lefelong le le kgakala**.

Here's why:

* **P** states that modern research telescopes are in remote locations with good atmospheric conditions.
* **P** also implies that old observatories were *not* in remote locations, because light pollution wasn't a problem back then.
* Therefore, an old observatory is least likely to be in a remote location.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Mo lefelong le le fitlhelelwang motlhofo:**  The passage implies old observatories *are* in accessible locations.
* **B: Mo bogareng ba toropo:** The passage states they were often located in cities.
* **D: Mo lefelong la bonno la mo kholetšhe:** The passage says they were often in or near residential areas.
"
Thelesekhoupu ya patlisiso ya segompieno e ka bewa kae?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: Mo kagong e kgolo**.

The passage states that modern research telescopes are ""dikago tse di boitshegang mo mafelong a a kgakala a a nang le maemo a atemosefiere a a nametsang"" (massive structures in remote locations with good atmospheric conditions). While the other options might be locations of *old* observatories, the passage clearly contrasts them with the location of *modern* research telescopes.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke lefelo lefe le le ka tshwanelang go gaisa, letsatsi la go itheetsa kwa lotshitshing la lewatle?","The best answer is **B: Mission Bay**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Tamaki Drive beaches, including Mission Bay and St Heliers, are located in Waitemata Harbour. It specifically mentions that **these beaches are often crowded with families and have various shops along the beachfront.** This description makes Mission Bay a desirable place for a beach day.

Let's look at why the other options are less ideal:

*   **A: St Heliers:** While St Heliers is also on Tamaki Drive and suitable, Mission Bay is likely the best answer as it is mentioned and can be assumed the better option, as it is stated to have mabenkele a a farologaneng a a mo letshitshing(various shops along the beachfront)
*   **C: Bokone jwa Kgaolo ya Boemakepe(North Shore):** The passage mentions that the North Shore beaches are generally sandy and safe for swimming, but there's no specific indication that they are as suitable as Mission Bay.

*   **D: Boemakepe jwa Waitemata(Waitemata Harbour):** Waitemata Harbour is a general location, not a specific beach.
"
"Go ya ka temana,maemo a go thuma, a ka nna a babalesega go feta kae?","The correct answer is **B: Bokone jwa Kgaolo ya Boemakepe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Matshitshi a lewatle a a kwa bokone (kwa Bokone jwa Kgaolo ya Boemakepe) a mo Lewatleng la Pacific mme a ikadile go tswa kwa Long Bay kwa bokone go ya Devonport kwa borwa. Otlhe fela a batla e le mabopo a a nang le motlhaba e bile go babalesegile go thuma mo go one..."" This clearly indicates that the beaches in the North Shore area (Bokone jwa Kgaolo ya Boemakepe) are generally safe for swimming.
"
"Fa o etela lefelo le le tlhalositsweng mo temaneng, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e ka tsewang e sa tshwanela?","Based on the passage, the following actions would be considered inappropriate:

*   **B: Go tlogela matshwao gongwe mo lefelong (Leaving marks somewhere on the site)**
*   **C: Go dira metlae (Making jokes)**
*   **D: Go kgwarinya motako (Scratching graffiti)**

Therefore, all of B, C, and D are inappropriate. However, since you need to choose only one, the best answer is the one that encompasses the most destructive actions:

*Leaving marks somewhere on the site, making jokes, and scratching graffiti all violate the request to treat the place with dignity, reverence, and respect.

Considering the options you've provided, the most comprehensive and inappropriate action among them is:

**B: Go tlogela matshwao gongwe mo lefelong (Leaving marks somewhere on the site)**

This is the most encompassing of the negative actions.
"
Ke efe ya tseno e e tlhalosang dipuo tsa lingua francas?,"The correct answer is **D: Tse di tshelang**.

The passage states that lingua francas are ""tsa tlholego kgotsa dipuo tse di tshelang"" (natural or living languages).
"
Ke polelo efe e e sa tlhaloseng dipuo tse di thusang ka nepagalo?,"The correct answer is **D: Ke dipuo tse di itlhametsweng, tse e leng tsone tse di eteletseng pele magareng ga batho ba ba buang dipuo tse di farologaneng**.

Here's why:

* **P** clearly distinguishes auxiliary languages (dipuo tse di thusang) from lingua francas.  Lingua francas *are* the languages that naturally rise to prominence for communication between different language speakers. Auxiliary languages are artificial and intentionally created.  Option D incorrectly suggests that auxiliary languages are the ones that become dominant, which contradicts the original statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** This describes a *lingua franca*, not an auxiliary language, but it's an accurate description of that type of language within the context of P. The statement is simply saying that auxiliary languages are not living languages.
* **B:** This accurately describes auxiliary languages as artificial and invented.
* **C:** This correctly explains the purpose of auxiliary languages: to facilitate communication where it would otherwise be difficult.
"
"Go ya ka temana,mopagami o tshwanetse a lebe eng fa leeto la bone la sekepe le le ka mariga?","The correct answer is **A: Kwa ntlwana e leng teng**.

The passage states: ""Fa o kgabaganya Bokone jwa Baltic ka mariga, leba go re ntlwana e ko kae..."" This directly instructs the traveler to consider the location of the cabin when traveling in the Baltic during winter.
"
"Go ya ka temana,fa leeto la sekepe la mopalami le le selemo, ke eng seo a ka kgonang go se efoga","The correct answer is **B: Go tsamaya mo dikgapetleng**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that crossing the Northern Baltic in **winter** involves ice sheets and the associated unpleasant noise. Therefore, in **summer**, a passenger on a cruise ship would avoid traveling on ice sheets.
*   The passage doesn't mention needing a visa in summer
*   The passage doesn't mention the passenger being able to avoid nako kwa toropong
*   The passage doesn't mention the passenger being able to avoid Saint Petersburg
"
Goreng Secatalan se dirisiwa kgapetsakgapetsa mo matshwaong le dikitsisong mo Barcelona?,"The correct answer is **B: E ne e le leleme la semmuso la ntlha la toropo**.

The text explicitly states that Catalan is the legally established primary national language, explaining its prevalence on signs. The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Se tlhaloganngwa ka bontsi go feta se-Spanich:** The text says most people understand Spanish.
*   **C: Batho ba ikgethela leleme leo kwa Barcelona:** While many people choose to speak Catalan, this is not the primary reason for its use on signs.
*   **D: Mo Metro le mafelo a mangwe a bosetšhaba, go tla bontsi jwa baagi ba ba buang Secatalan:** While many Catalan speakers use the Metro, this is not the reason for the language choice on signs.
"
Ke efe ya diteme tse di latelang e e diriswang ke tsamaiso ya Metro ya kwa Barcelona go dira dikitsiso tsa ka metlha?,"Karabo e nepagetseng ke **B: Se-Catalan**.

"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya tse di latelang tse di ka se tshwarelweng kwa Beijing ka 2022?","The correct answer is **B: Ditiragalo tsa go relela mo serameng kwa Taizicheng**.

The passage states that ""Ditiragalo tse dingwe tsa go relela mo serameng (skiing) di tla tshwarelwa kwa lefelong la itheletsho mo serameng la Taizicheng kwa Zhangjiakou...""  This means the skiing events will take place in Taizicheng, not Beijing. The other options (opening ceremony, closing ceremony, and indoor ice events) are all stated to be held in Beijing.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e tla tshwarwang ke Beijing ka 2022?","The correct answer is **C: Diolimpiki tsa mariga**.

The first sentence of the passage clearly states that Beijing will host the 2022 Winter Olympics. While other options are mentioned in the text, they are either incorrect or only partially correct in relation to what Beijing *hosts*.
"
Ke mang a leng kotsing thata ya go tshwaediwa ke mohikelo wa dinonyane?,"The correct answer is **C: Batho ba ba berekang le dikoko le dipidipidi**

The passage states: ""Gantsi go amega batho ba ba berekang le dikoko le dipidipidi, mme fela le balebeledi ba dinonyane le bone ga ba a sireletsega."" This directly indicates that people who work with chickens and ducks are most commonly affected.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya dipolelo tse di latelang, tse di tlhalosang ka nepagalo,mohikela wa dinonyane?","The correct answer is **C: Balebeledi ba dinonyane ba mo kotsing ya go tshwaediwa.**

The passage states: ""Gantsi go amega batho ba ba berekang le dikoko le dipidipidi, mme fela le balebeledi ba dinonyane le bone ga ba a sireletsega."" This directly translates to ""Usually people who work with chickens and ducks are affected, but even bird watchers are not safe."" This indicates bird watchers are at risk.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ba ba berekang le dikoko le dipidipidi, ke bone fela ba ba tshwaeditsweng ke mohikela:** This is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that bird watchers are also at risk. The ""fela"" means ""only"" which is incorrect in this context.
*   **B: Go begilwe dikgetse di le dintsi mo bathong go feta mo dinonyaneng:** The passage states less than a thousand cases have been confirmed in humans. It doesn't compare this number to the number of cases in birds, so we can't say this statement is accurate based on the text.
*   **D: Dikgetse tsotlhe tse di begilweng mo bathong, diphelelo e nnile loso:** The passage mentions that some cases were severe but it does not indicate all cases resulted in death.

Therefore, C is the only statement accurately reflected in the provided passage.
"
White Sea–Baltic Canal e golanyanya eng?,"The correct answer is **C: Arctic Ocean le Baltic Sea**.

The passage states: ""White se-Baltic Canal e golaganya Arctic ocean le Baltic Sea...""
"
"Go ya ka temana, makwalo a mesepele a ka latiwa ka mofuta ofe wa sepalangwa go itsa go kgaupetsa mopagami?","The correct answer is **B: Diterena tsa bosigo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Mo ditereneng tsa bosigo, dibukana tsa mesepele di ka tsewa ke babereki ba terena go itsa go kgaupetsa bapalami boroko.""
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke neng mo bukana ya gago ya boitshupo e ka tlhatlhobiwang teng mo ditereneng dingwe tse di kgabaganyang melelwane?","The correct answer is **D: Terene e ntse e tsamaya**.

The passage states: ""Mo ditereneng dingwe tse di kgabaganyang melelwane ditlhatlhobo di dirwa mo tereneng e ntse e tsamaya..."". This directly indicates that identity documents are checked while the train is in motion on some border-crossing trains.
"
"Ke efe ya dikgang tse di latelang, e e ka nneng ya tlhagelela thata fa o nna kwa lefelong le le gaufi thata le mola wa equator kwa Singapore?","Kgang e e ka tlhagelelang thata fa o nna kwa lefelong le le gaufi thata le mola wa equator kwa Singapore ke **C: Go felelwa ke maatla ka ntlha ya mogote**.

Dikgetho tse dingwe ga di a nepagala ka gonne di bua fela ka dikgetho tsa motho, mme ga di na mabaka a kalafi a go tila marotho a Sejeremane.
"
Ke sediriswa sefe se se se kaiwang jaaka karolo ya paka e e rileng ya di-pastry tsa Majeremane?,"The correct answer is **C: Di-plums**.

The passage states that ""Di-pastry tsa maungo di tlwaelegile...fa tsa maungo a cherry le plum di bonala ka paka ya selemo."" This means plums are specifically mentioned as being available during the summer season.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya tse di latelang tse e ka nnang ntlha ya kakantsho ka “traveling on a budget”?","The correct answer is **B: Ikemisetse go latlhegelwa ke manobonobo** (Be willing to lose luxuries).

Here's why:

* The passage states that those willing to forgo luxuries to reduce costs should look into ""minimum budget travel."" This directly links sacrificing luxuries to budget travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go theogela o ntse o le mo loetong** (Falling while on a trip): This is mentioned as one of the two ways to see the world cheaply, but the passage focuses on the second way, which is reducing spending.
* **C: Kopa batho madi** (Asking people for money): The passage explicitly prohibits begging.
* **D: Fokotsa ditshenyegelo jaaka dijo le bonno** (Reduce expenses like food and accommodation): While this is related, it's not the core defining characteristic that the passage associates with ""minimum budget travel."" Being willing to lose luxuries is the overarching principle that leads to reducing expenses on things like food and accommodation.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mang yo o ka kgaratlhelang go tsamaya ka madi a a lekanetseng?","The correct answer is **A: Mongwe yo o amogelang kgwetlho**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that ""ba ba ikemiseditseng go latlhegelwa ke manobononobo, nako le tebelopele go re ba fokotse tshenyegelo ya madi, ba lebe """"minimum budget travel"""". "" This implies that minimum budget travel is a challenge that requires sacrifice. Therefore, someone who embraces challenges would be well-suited for this type of travel.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Mongwe yo o nang le nako e ntsi:** While having time is helpful, the passage focuses on the willingness to give up comforts and flexibility, not just having time.
*   **C: Mongwe yo o rulaganyang go dira a le kgakala fa a ntse a le mo loetong:** This relates to the first option mentioned in the text, not the ""minimum budget travel"" which is the second and focal option mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Mongwe yo o itumelelang go latela thulaganyo ya loeto:** The passage mentions that minimum budget travel involves sacrificing ""tebelopele"" (foresight/planning), suggesting that strict adherence to a travel plan may not be a priority.
"
"Ke efe ya dipolelo tse di latelang, e e sa tlhaloseng ka go nepagala,go kgweetsa magareng ga Point Marion le Fairmont?","The passage states that the speed limit is noticeably lower in sections, typically 35-40 mph, and that *obeying* those limits is very important. This contradicts option C, which says the speed limit is *not* often followed. Therefore, C is the inaccurate statement.

The answer is **C: Selekanyo se se supilweng sa lobelo ga se gantsi se latelwa**
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke sefe sa tseno se bakgweetsi ba tshwanetseng ba tshwenyege thata ka sone fa ba kgweetsa mo tselafefong ya Buffalo-Pittsburg?","The correct answer is **C: Go retologa ka bonako mo tseleng e e motsopodia**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions ""mefologelo, ditselana tse di tshesane, le metsopodia ya tsela e e segogoropo"". This directly refers to sharp turns on winding roads.
*   The passage emphasizes being cautious and adhering to the speed limit, implying that these sharp turns can be dangerous.

The other options are not as directly emphasized in the text:

*   **A: Go tshwarwa ke pharakano e e kitlaneng** - The passage does not discuss heavy traffic.
*   **B: Go tlhoka tirelo e e lekaneng ya mogala** - The passage mentions that cell service is surprisingly *better* in this section than in other parts of the route.
*   **D: Go kopana le ditiro tsa ditsela kgapetsakgapetsa** - The passage does not refer to road construction."
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e sa tlhokegeng go simolola motshameko wa go dirisa seketswana?","The correct answer is **D: Go itshidila mmele go le gonnye**.

Here's why:

The passage states that canyoning (which involves swimming, climbing, and jumping) **doesn't necessarily require significant physical preparation** compared to activities like rock climbing or scuba diving.  The other options are more clearly implied as necessary:

*   **A: Bokgoni ba go thuma (Swimming ability):** Canyoning often involves water, making swimming essential.
*   **B: Seemo sa mmele se se siameng (Good physical condition):** While intense training may not be necessary, a reasonable level of fitness is needed for canyoning's physical demands.
*   **C: Kgono ya go tlola (Jumping ability):** The passage explicitly mentions jumping as part of canyoning.

Therefore, light exercise is not always needed.
"
"Ke dife tsa tseno, tse di ka tlhokegang mo loetong lo lo khutswane lwa canyoning?","Based on the provided text, the best answer is **D: Bokgoni ba go thuma**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that canyoning ""akaretsa gape go thuma"" (includes swimming). This makes swimming a likely requirement, even for a shorter trip.
*   The passage contrasts canyoning with activities like scuba diving, implying that specialized skills in those areas are *not* necessarily required.
*   The passage says canyoning doesn't need a lot of preparation of extreme exercise when compared to activities like rock climbing, but doesn't exclude fitness entirely.
*   The passage does not include information about the need of a certificate of canyoneering.

Therefore, **D** is the most direct and accurate answer based on the given text."
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo se ka thusang fa motho a rulaganyetsa go kampa mo koloing ya gagwe?","The correct answer is **B: Koloi e e nang le ditilo tse o kgonang go di robatsa**.

The passage states: ""O ka kampa mo koloing fa o na le bene e tona, koloi ya modiro wa SUV, sedan kgotsa Station Wagon e e nang le ditilo tse o kgonang go di robatsa."" This directly indicates that having seats that can fold down is helpful for camping in a car.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo ba ba kampelang mo koloing ba ka batlang go se efoga gore ba se bonagale?","The correct answer is **C: Go tlhoma tente mo toropong kgotsa mo lelwapeng la mong**.

The passage states: ""Go tlhoma tente mo lelwapeng la mong kgotsa toropo go sa kgathalesege go re e botona bo kae go kgona go go biletsa dira."" This directly implies that pitching a tent in a town or someone's yard is something people camping in their car might want to avoid to not attract unwanted attention.
"
"Go ya ka temana, Ke mang yo o agileng Casablanca seša lokgetlho lwa bobedi?","The correct answer is **D: Kgosikgolo ya Morocco**.

The passage states: ""Kgosikgolo wa Morocco o ne a e aga gape toropo e, a e bitsa Daru I-Badya"". This translates to ""The King of Morocco rebuilt the city, calling it Daru I-Badya.""
"
Ke mang yo a ikgatolositseng toropo ya gompieno ya Casablanca morago ga masetlapelo a tlholego,"The correct answer is **B: Mapotokisi**.

The passage states that ""Ma-Potokisi ba ile ba di thuba mme ba tswa ba di aga sesha ka leina la Casa Branca, mme morago ga moo ba di ikgatolosa morago ga thoromo ya lefatshe ya ngwaga wa 1755.""
"
"Go ya ka temana,Sintra e ne ya tumisiwa ke eng magareng ga batswantle?","The correct answer is **C: Pego e ntle, e e begilweng ke Lord Byron**.

The passage states that Sintra was made famous among expatriates ""morago ga pego e ntle ya bontle jwa yone e e begilweng ke Lord Byron"" (after a beautiful report of its beauty reported by Lord Byron).
"
Ke eng se se tsa tseweng tsia ke Armenia?,"The correct answer is **D: Lefatshe le lešwa** (The new country).

The passage states that the new country formed in Nagorno-Karabakh is *not* recognized by other countries, including Armenia.
"
Ke eng se se tsweletseng go goga- goga mo seretseng dikamano tsa magareng ga Azerbaijan le Armenia?,"The correct answer is **C: Dingangisano tsa sepolotiki**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Dingangisano tsa sepolitiki kaga kgaolo di tsweletse ka go goga goga mo seretseng dikamano tsa magareng ga Armenia le Azerbaijan.""
"
"Fa o pagama tekesi kwa Charlotte, ke eng se se ka dirang gore go nne le tuelo ya tlaleletso?","The correct answer is **B: Go nna le bapagami ba le bararo**.

The passage states: ""Go na le tuelo ya tlaleletso fa bapagami ba feta 2, ka jalo jaana go tura go feta selekanyo."" This clearly indicates an extra fee is charged when there are more than two passengers.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se se ka kaiwang e le se se sa itumediseng ka go nna kwa Charlotte le bana?","The correct answer is **B: Go drisa tekisi**.

The passage specifically mentions that taking taxis in Charlotte is expensive, especially for families, due to extra charges for more than two passengers. This is presented as a negative aspect of living in Charlotte.
"
"Pele ga ba-Spain ba  goroga, Chile e e kwa bokone e ne e busiwa ke mang?","The correct answer is **D: Ya Inca**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Pele ga ba-Spain ba goroga mo lekgolong la bo-16 la dingwaga, Chile e e kwa bokone e ne e busiwa ke Inca...""
"
".Go ya ka temana,ke sefe sa tse di latelang se se sa diragalang ka 1810?","The correct answer is **B: Chile e fitlheletse go fenya Maspain**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Chile achieved independence in 1810.
*   It also says that the complete defeat of the Spanish was not achieved until 1818.
*   The passage mentions that the Napoleonic Wars were happening, which caused the absence of a government.

Therefore, the only thing that *didn't* happen in 1810 was the complete defeat of the Spanish."
Batho ba ka fitlha jang kwa metsaneng mo kgaolong ya Liguria?,"The passage states: ""Ditselana, diterena, le mekoro di kopanya metse e, mme dikoloi ga di kgone go goroga go tswa ko ntle.""

This means people can reach the villages by train and boat, but not by car.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: Ka terena kgotsa sekepe (By train or boat).
"
Lereo la Sentariane le le reng ‘Cinque Terre’ le raya eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Metsana e Metlhano**.

The text states: ""Clique Terra, mo go rayang Mafelo a Matlhano..."" which translates to ""Cinque Terre, which means Five Lands..."" and ""Mafelo a Matlhano"" translates to ""Five Villages"". Therefore, Cinque Terre means ""Five Villages/Lands"".
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke mofuta ofe wa ditlhako o o tshwanetseng maemo a mariga a a ka reledisang?","The correct answer is **B: Ditlhako tse di nang le didiriswa tse di ka tshwarisiwang mo ditlhakong tsa mefuta e e farologanyeng ka bontsi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions ""there are devices that can be attached to shoes of various types."" This suggests that using these devices makes shoes more suitable for slippery winter conditions.

Let's analyze the other options:

*   **A: Ditlhako tsa dikwaekwae tse di tshesane (Narrow high-heeled shoes):** The passage advises against high heels, stating, ""Heels should be low and wide.""
*   **C: Ditlhako tsa dikwaekwae tse di kwa godimo (High heeled shoes):** This is the opposite of what the passage recommends.
*   **D: Ditlhako tse di se nang boteng ba kgatiso ya mm( 1/5 inch) (Shoes without a tread depth of 5mm (1/5 inch):** The passage emphasizes the importance of a tread depth of at least 5mm."
Ke efe ya tseno e e ka se thuseng go tokafatsa tsamao mo ditseleng tsa metsi a a gatsetseng mo marigeng?,"The correct answer is **D: Metsi**.

Metsu e ka dira fela gore ditsele di tsamae reledi mo marigeng. Metsotlhe e mengwe e go buiwang ka yone e dirisiwa go oketsa tshwaro mo sekgweng kgotsa mo mmung, go dira gore go tsamae go nne motlhofo."
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e tshwanang sentle magareng ga Hawaii le Setlhaketlhake sa Cook?","The correct answer is **C: Di na le nako e e tshwanang**.

The passage states: ""E re ka di na le nako e e tshwanang le ya Hawaii..."" (Since they have the same time zone as Hawaii...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bobedi jwa tsone, di na le dihotele di le dintsi, tse ditona:** The passage explicitly says the Cook Islands *don't* have big tourist hotels.
*   **B: Bobedi jwa tsone, ga se leloko la Amerika:** While true for the Cook Islands, the passage implies Hawaii *is* a part of America (""before it became a member of America"").
*   **D: Bobedi jwa tsone ga bo na ditoropo:** The passage doesn't say Hawaii doesn't have cities.
"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e sa tlhaloseng ka nepagalo, ditlhaketlhake tsa Cook?","The correct answer is **C: Ditoropo tsa konokono ke Rarotonga le Aitutaki**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ditlhaketlhake tsa Cook ga di na toropo dipe mme di dirilwe ka ditlhaketlhake di le 15 tse di farologaneng. Ditlhaketlhake tsa konokono ke Rarotonga le Aitukaki."" This means Rarotonga and Aitutaki are the main *islands*, not cities.
"
Ke afe a mafelo a batlhokomedi ba diparaka a a neelanang ka mefuta e mebedi ya maroko?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

The passage states: ""Sirena ke yone fela lefelo la batlhokomedi ba paraka le le neelanang ka lefelo la boroko le dijo tse di bolelo mo godimo ga go kampa."" This means Sirena offers both lodging and camping. The other locations only offer camping.
"
"Go ya ka temana,o ka bona kae teseletso ya go phaka fa o batla go dirisa madi a seatleng go na le dikarata tsa madi?","The correct answer is **B: Puerto Jiménez**.

The text states: ""Go a kgonagala go bona teseletso ya phaka gotswa go mannong a batlhokomedi kwa Puerto Jiménez, mme ga ba tseye dikarata tsa madi."" This translates to ""It is possible to obtain a park permit from the ranger station in Puerto Jiménez, but they do not accept credit cards.""
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mofuta ofe wa go skiya o o dirwang go tswa kwa godimodimo?","The passage states: ""Ke sika loo alpine skiing kgotsa moutaineering le fa tota e se selo se le sengwe, tse di dirwang go tswa kwa godimodimo..."". This means that alpine skiing or mountaineering is done from high altitudes.

The closest answer to this is **C: Mokgwa wa Alpine** because ""alpine skiing"" is directly mentioned as being done from high altitudes.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se se ka thusang ba ba skiyang mo sekgweng, ba batla go bona mabelo a a kwa godingwana?","The correct answer is **B: Sekgwama se se bokete**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""...mme ke ka sewelo o ka bonang mabelo a go ralala naga a go relela mo kapokong ntle le **sekgwama se se bokete se se belegwang** mo ditselaneng tse di gorutsweng.""

This directly implies that a heavy backpack is associated with cross-country skiing in the backcountry, which is what the question is asking about.
"
Batsamai ba ba bowang ba tlwaela botshelo jwa ga bo bone ba se na go nna kwa lefatsheng le sele ba kgaratlhela go dira eng?,"The correct answer is **D: Go bowa ba tlwaela setso sa bone**.

The passage states that returning travelers often struggle to readjust to their own culture (""Fa o boela gae o sena go nna kwa mafatsheng a sele, o setse o tlwaetse ngwao e ncha e bile o o latlhile le mekgwa le ngwao ya ga go"" - When you return home after living in foreign lands, you are already used to a new culture and have lost your own customs and culture). This means they struggle with re-adapting to their own culture upon return.
"
"Go ya ka temana, go bowa o tlwaela botshelo ba kwa gaeno o se na go nna kwa lefatsheng le sele, go ka nna bokete thatathata go mofuta ofe wa motsamai?","The correct answer is **B: Batsamai ba ba amogelang setso le botshelo jwa lefatshe le sele motlhofo**.

The passage states: ""Batsamai ba ba amogelang ngwao le botshelo jwa lefathe le sele motlhofo ke bone thatatathata ba a tleng ba sokole go bowa ba tlwaela ngwao ya bone fa ba boela gae."" This directly supports option B.
"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e batho ba tshwanetseng go efoga go e dira go moose?,"The correct answer is **B: Atamela o se kelotlhoko**.

The passage states that people put their lives at risk when they approach moose without caution. Therefore, avoiding approaching a moose without caution is the action to avoid. The other options are either something the moose does (C) or something one *should* do (A and D).
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya dipolelo tse di latelang ka moose, ga se nnete?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **A: Ke diphologolo tse di mafega.**

Temana e bolela gore moose ga e bogale, fa e se fela e iphemela. Diitlhopho tse dingwe ke nnete go ya ka temana:

*   **B: Ka dinako dingwe, ba ka baya matshelo a bone mo diphatseng:** Temana e bua ka gore batho ba ka baya matshelo a bone mo diphatseng fa ba atamela moose ba sa leka go itshireletsa.
*   **C: Ba ka e atamela ba se kelotlhoko:** Temana e bua ka gore batho ba ka atamela moose ba se kelotlhoko.
*   **D: Di tla iphemela fa di dumela e gomagomediwa botshelo:** Temana e bolela gore moose e iphemela fa e dumela e gomagomediwa botshelo."
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya tse di latelang, ke eng se se ka se nneng borai go baeng ba sekaka?","The correct answer is **None of the above**.

The question asks which of the options is NOT a danger to desert travelers, but all the options ARE dangers mentioned in the passage. Let's break it down:

*   **A: Fa motho a sa apara dilwana tse di bothito mo bosigong jo bo tsididi (Not wearing warm clothes on a cold night):** The passage explicitly states ""Go wela mogote wa mmele thata, go a kgonega fa motho a sa apara dilwana tse di bothitho."" (Hypothermia is possible if someone doesn't wear warm clothes). Therefore, this IS a danger.
*   **B: Go itemogela meuwane e e dirang ekete o bona metsi (Experiencing mirages that make you think you see water):** The passage mentions ""basepidi ba ka itemogela meuwane e e dirang go re e nne e kete o bona metsi...Se se ka nna borai"" (Travelers can experience mirages that make it seem like you see water... This can be dangerous). Therefore, this IS a danger.
*   **C: Go senya maatla fa o latelela dilo tse di seyong (Wasting energy chasing things that aren't there):** The passage says ""Se se ka nna borai fa e le go re mosepedi o latelela dilo tse di seyong, a senya maatla..."" (This can be dangerous if the traveler chases things that aren't there, wasting energy). Therefore, this IS a danger.
*   **D: Go senya metsi fa o latelela dilo tse seyong (Wasting water chasing things that aren't there):** The passage says ""Se se ka nna borai fa e le go re mosepedi o latelela dilo tse di seyong, a senya maatla le metsi tse di botlhokwa thata tse di setseng."" (This can be dangerous if the traveler chases things that aren't there, wasting energy and water). Therefore, this IS a danger.

It seems there's a flaw in the question. All the options are mentioned as dangers. If the question intended to find something *not* dangerous, it failed to provide such an option."
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang , e e sa umakiwang jaaka se se ka nnang borai go basepidi ba sekaka?","The correct answer is **A: Tlhaelo ya metsi**.

While water scarcity is a huge danger in the desert, the passage doesn't list it directly as *a danger* that travelers experience. It is a consequence of following mirages and wasting water, but not a direct danger mentioned in the passage. Options B, C, and D are explicitly mentioned as dangers."
"Go ya ka temana, ke setlhopha sa baagi bafe se se neng se fokodiwe morago ga gore babatlisisi?","The correct answer is C: Mataino.

The passage states: ""Mo dingwageng di le mmalwanyana fela morago ga go re babatlisisi ba Yuropa ba goroge, baagi ba ba-Taino ba ne ba fokoditse thata ke bathopi ba ba-Spain."" This directly indicates that the Taino population was significantly reduced after the arrival of European explorers.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke puo e feng e e neng e buiwa ke Macaribe?","The correct answer is **D: Arawakan**.

The passage states: ""Ba-Caribe e ne e le batho ba puo ya se-Arawakan...""
"
Ke mang a ka supiwang e le yo o neng a bula lefelo la ntlha la go skiya jaaka itloso bodutu?,"The correct answer is **B: Manowegian**.

The passage states ""Ka ngwaga wa 1861 ma-Norweigan mangwe ba ne ba bula lefelo lwa ntlha la itlosa boduto la go skiya kwa Australia."" which translates to ""In 1861 some Norwegians opened the first ski resort in Australia.""
"
"Go ya ka temana,e ka nna neng fa motshameko wa go skiya o neng o simolola go tseelwa tlhogong?","The correct answer is **A: Dingwageng tsa bo 18**.

The passage states: ""Motshameko wa go skiya, o simolotse mo dingwageng tsa bo 18-- bogologolo."" This clearly indicates that skiing began in the 1800s.
"
"Ke sefe sa tse di latelang, se, ka tlwaelo,se golagangwang le setlhaketlhake se segolo go feta lewatle la Botlhabatsatsi jwa Afrika?","The correct answer is **C: Diphologolo tsa naga**.

The passage states: ""Madagascar ke yone e kgolo mo go tsotlhe, mme e bile go ka twe ke kontinente e e ikemetseng ka nosi fa go lebilwe **diphologolo tsa naga**."" This directly links the largest island, Madagascar, with its unique wildlife.
"
Ke eng seo ditlhaketlhake tse dinnye tsa Botlhabatsatsi jwa Afrika di se nang sone? ,"The correct answer is **C: Go lebilwe diphologolo tsa naga**.

Here's why:

*   **P** states that Madagascar is like a continent of its own because of its unique wildlife. This implies that the smaller islands *don't* have the same level of unique and diverse wildlife.
*   **A** states that many of the smaller islands have links with France.
*   **B** states that the islands are well known for their high-end resorts.
*   **D** states that many of the islands are independent from other nations."
"Go ya ka temana, Paseka e ketekiwa jang ke dingwe tsa, segolobogolo,dikereke tsa setso?","The correct answer is **B, C**.

The passage states: ""Dikereke tsa setso ga ntsi di tshwara Tebelelo ya Paseka bosigo ja Lamatlhatso ka mafelo a beke a Paseka, ka phuthego e keteka ka bosigogare go itumelela tsogo ya ga Keresete.""  This directly indicates that traditional churches celebrate Easter by holding an Easter Vigil on Saturday night and celebrating the resurrection of Christ at midnight. Therefore both B and C are valid answers.
"
"Gore ba seka ba amiwa ke tlhokego eno fa o tsena ka Ecuador,moagi wa Cuba o tshwanetse a nne le eng pele?","The correct answer is **D: Karata e tala ya US**

The passage states: ""Baagi ba Cuba ba ba nang le karata e tala ya US ba tshwanetse go etela Kantoro ya Boemedi ya Ecuador go re ba seka ba amiwa ke tlhokego eno."" This means that Cuban citizens with a US Green Card are exempt from the requirement of needing a letter of invitation to enter Ecuador.
"
Ditlhokego tsa Ecuador tsa mosepele ga di a direlwa eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Go neelana ka tshedimosetso ya tsa bofudugelo magareng ga dinaga tse pedi**.

The passage explicitly states that the requirements are ""diretswe go neelana ka tshedimosetso ya tsa bofudugelo magareng ga dinaga tse pedi"".
"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e ka nnang tlhwatlhwa- godimo kwa nageng e sele go na le kwa lapeng?,"Let us analyze the provided statements to determine which of the options could be more expensive in a foreign country compared to at home.

*   **P: Eye exams in foreign countries can be less expensive, especially in lower-income countries where labor costs are lower.** This statement directly indicates that eye exams are generally *less* expensive abroad.

*   **P: Consider getting an eye exam at home, especially if you have medical insurance, and take a prescription to be filled elsewhere.** This further supports the idea that the focus is on saving money on the actual glasses and not the eye exam.

*   **P: Designer frames being available in such places presents two possible problems; they are not authentic, and authentic ones are more expensive than in their place of origin.** This statement strongly suggests that authentic designer frames can be *more* expensive abroad than at home.

Now let's examine the options:

*   **A: Go tlhatlhobiwa matlho (Eye exams):** Statement P suggests that eye exams are *less* expensive in some foreign countries.

*   **B: Diforeimi tsa maemo (Designer frames):** Statement P states that authentic designer frames can be more expensive abroad.

*   **C: Itshireletso ya tsa pono (Vision Insurance):** The text doesn't directly discuss vision insurance costs in foreign countries.

*   **D: Diforeimi tse tse e seng tsa maemo (Non-designer frames):** The text does not mention the cost of non-designer frames when comparing a home country to abroad.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Diforeimi tsa maemo (Designer frames)** because the passage explicitly states that authentic designer frames can be more expensive abroad."
Ke eng se se ka nnang le matshosetsi ka go reka diforeimi tsa maemo mo nageng e sele?,"The correct answer is **C: Di ka nne di a se nne tsa nnete**

The passage explicitly states that if brand-name frames are found in these locations, one of the potential problems is that ""ga se tsa nnete"" (they are not authentic).  The other options are not directly mentioned as risks associated with buying frames overseas in the passage.
"
"Tebang le tiriso ya ledi kwa Falklands, ke efe ya dipolelo tse di latelang e e leng nnete?","The correct answer is **D: Kwa ntle ga ponto ya Falkland , ponto ya Boritane, go le gantsi, e amogelwa gongwe le gongwe**

Here's why:

*   **P:** The passage states ""Diponto tsa Borithane go le ga ntsi di amogelwa gongwe le gongwe mo ditlhaketlhakeng..."" This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage indicates that while credit cards *might* not be accepted on outer islands, both British and US currency might be. It doesn't say credit cards and GBP are *only* accepted.
*   **B:** The passage says US dollars are *often* accepted, but not that Stanley is the *only* place they are.
*   **C:** The passage states it's ""go batla go sa kgonege gotlhelele go ananya madi a Falklands ka kwa ntle ga setlhaketlhake se, ka jalo ananya madi pele o tswa mo setlhakatlhakeng"" (almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange the money before leaving). Thus one should exchange it before leaving, not *after*."
"Go ya ka temana,fa o ya Falklands, o tswa United States, ke kae moo mokgwa wa tuelo, kwa ntle ga karata ya molato, o tla nnang molemo thata?","The correct answer is **D: Kwa Stanley**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that British Pounds are widely accepted in Stanley.
*   It also mentions that US dollars are often accepted in Stanley.
*   The passage explicitly mentions that the only bank where currency exchange is possible is in Stanley.

Therefore, Stanley is the most likely place where US dollars would be useful as payment, aside from credit cards."
Ke moletlo ofe o o sa golaganang le go dirwa ga meletlo ya tempele?,"The correct answer is **A: Go tsalwa ga tlou**.

Here's why:

*   The paragraph mentions temple anniversaries, birthdays of the deity, and other festivals related to the temple.
*   The birth of an elephant is not mentioned as a reason for temple festivals in the provided text."
Ke kae moo ditlou tse di kgabisitsweng di ka bonwang teng?,"The best answer is **C: Go a tle go bonale le ditlou tse di kgabisitseng** because it directly quotes a portion of the original text that describes the elephants.

Let's break down why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Gongwe le gongwe, go tswa bokhutlong jwa Ngwanatsele, go fitlha Motsheganong e le fa gare**: While the passage mentions this timeframe, it's about the festivals, not specifically where the elephants are found.
*   **B: Ditempeleng**: The passage says the festivals are *often* at temples, but it doesn't explicitly limit the presence of decorated elephants *only* to temples.
*   **D: Mo mebileng ya Kerala**: While it's possible they might be in the streets, the passage specifically mentions them in the context of *Kerala temples*. While technically correct, option C more closely relates to the context given.

"
"Go ya ka temana,ke mekgwa efe ya e e latelang, ya go fokolediwa tlhwatlhwa mo karolong ya tsa bagwebi kgotsa ya maemo a ntlha?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is:

*   **A: Kopa ba setheo sa gago go go duelela**

The passage states that one way to fly in first class or business class is to ""ask your organization to pay for it.""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Fa o dirisa karolo ya maemo a ntlha go na le ya tsa bagwebi**: This is not mentioned in the passage as a way to get a discount
*   **C: Go dirisa sefofane se se sa tlhamalalang sa maemo a ntlha**: The passage specifically says trying to get a discount on a *direct* flight in business or first class is pointless.
*   **D: Go fokolediwa tlhwatlhwa**: The passage explicitly states that you are unlikely to get a discount."
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se go ka se nneng mosola go se batla fa o batla go dirisa dikarolo tse di rileng tsa sefofane?","The correct answer is **C: Go fokolediwa tlhwatlhwa**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...ga gona mosola wa go re o leke go fokolediwa tlhwatlhwa fa o le mo karolong ya kgwebo, kgotsa ya maemo a ntlha, mo sefofaneng se se tlhamalelang go tswa lefelo A go ya B."" This means it's not worthwhile to seek discounts when flying business or first class on a direct flight.

"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se marekisetso a simolotseng go se kabakanya?","The correct answer is **A: Dijo tse di apeetsweng ruri**.

The passage states: ""Marekisetso a simolotse go oketsa le go kabakanya **dijo tse di apeetsweng ruri**."" (Supermarkets have started to increase and diversify **ready-made meals**).

"Ke eng se se tlamelwang ke marekisetso a mangwe, se se ka kgatlhang bareki ba dijo tse di apeetsweng ruri?","The correct answer is **A: Marekisetso a dijo**.

The passage states that ""Mafatshe mangwe kgotsa mabenkele a a haphegileng a na le **marekisetso a dijo gautshwanyane**, go le ga ntsi e le a a iketlileng e bile dijo tsa teng di sa ture."" This directly answers the question of what some grocery stores provide that might appeal to consumers of ready-made meals.

Ke sefe sa tse di latelang tse di ka nneng di a se tlhaloganngwe ke ba-Belgium le ba- Switzerland ba ba buang Sefora?,"The best answer is **D: Sefora se se buiwang gantsi kwa Fora**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that people in Belgium and Switzerland learn standard French in school and can understand it. Options A, B and C are talking about the differences they speak, not the common French they can understand.

Therefore, the answer is **D**."
Ke eng sa tse di latelang se se farologaneng kwa France jaaka se le mo Belgium le Switzerland?,"The correct answer is **B: Thulaganyo ya dinomoro**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Segolobogolo, thulaganyo ya dinomore ya Sefora sa Belgium le Switzerland e harologana go go le gonnye le Sefora se se buiwang kwa Fora...""

"
Ke neng fa tiriso ya GPS e e ikemetseng ka nosi e leng botoka le go feta ditiriso tsa GPS tsa go supa tsela mo mogaleng wa gago wa letheka?,"The correct answer is **C: Fa o se na neteweke**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Fa o sena kgolagano ya inthanete mo mogaleng wa ga go, kana fa go sena neteweke, tiragatso ya tsone e ka nna ya lekanyediwa kgotsa ya seka ya nna teng."" (If you don't have an internet connection on your phone, or if there is no network, its performance may be limited or not available).
* **This directly implies:** A standalone GPS would be better when there's no network, as phone-based GPS relies on a network.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fa o leka go babalela madi (When you are trying to save money):** The passage states that using GPS on your phone can save money.
* **B: Fa o tlhomamisitse gore o tsile go nna le kgolagano ya inthanete (When you have ensured that you will have internet connection):** If you have internet, the passage suggests phone GPS works well.
* **D: Fa o sa batle go hira tiriso (When you don't want to hire an app):** This is not the focus of the passage. The passage discusses hiring dedicated GPS devices."
Ke eng se e seng lebaka le le siameng go dirisa ditiriswa tsa go supa tsela mo mogaleng wa gago wa letheka go na le tiriso e e ikemetseng?,"The correct answer is **A: Go sa tlhoke go tshwenyega ka kgolagano ya inthanete**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that GPS apps on phones can be limited or unusable without an internet connection. This is a *disadvantage* of using a phone for GPS compared to a standalone device. Therefore, *needing* an internet connection is a negative aspect, and *not needing* to worry about it would be a reason to *not* use your phone.
*   The other options (saving money, avoiding rental fees, not buying new maps) are all presented as advantages of using a phone for GPS in the passage."
"Go ya ka temana, o ka netefatsa jang gore o nyalanngwa le sekepe se se maleba?","The correct answer is **C: Buka le modiredi yo e leng moitseanape wa maeto a Galapagos**.

The passage states: ""Netefatsa gore modiredii yo o bukang mo go ene ke moitsaanape wa Galapagos yo o nang le kitso e e tseneletseng ka mefuta ya dikepe tse di farologaneng. Se se tla netefatsa go re dikeletso tsa ga go lekana dikgwetlho ka go kgethega di nyalanywa le sekepe se se a tshwanelang."" This directly supports option C.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya tse di latelang,e e sa dirisweng jaaka metlhale ya go dira gore bareki ba nne nako e ntsi mo teng?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **A: Lesedi la tlhago ka bontsi**.

Lebaka:

*   Temana e umaka gore mafelo a itloso bodutu a casino ga a nne le matlhabaphefo (a a ka nnang a tlhagisa lesedi la tlhago).
*   Temana e bua ka dijo tse di kgethegileng, dino, le tse di tlosang bodutu (kwa gare ga tse, dikarata tsa mahala tsa konsarata di ka tshwanela jaaka se se tlosang bodutu).
*   Temana e umaka bojalwa jwa mahala.
*   Temana e umaka go se nne le ditshupanako.

Jalo he, lesedi la tlhago ka bontsi ke selo se se sa umakweng jaaka metlhale ya go dira gore bareki ba nne nako e ntsi mo teng.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo mankge wa go betšha a tshwanetseng go se tila?","The correct answer is **A: Go tagiwa thata** (Getting heavily intoxicated).

The passage states that all gambling experts know the benefit of staying sober (not intoxicated). Therefore, a gambling expert should avoid getting heavily intoxicated.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke karolo efe ya puo e e simololang ka tlhaka e tona, le fa e le fa gare ga seele?","The correct answer is **B: Mafoko**.

The passage explicitly states ""Mafoko otlhe... ka nako tsotlhe a simolola ka tlhaka e tona..."" which translates to ""All words... always start with a capital letter...""
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se se ka ketefatsang thata, go simolola mafoko ka ditlhaka tse di tona?","The correct answer is **C: Go kwala**.

The passage states ""...go kwala go ketefatswa ke go tlhoka go itse go re lediri kgotsa letlhaodi a dirisiwa jang."" This translates to ""...writing is made difficult by not knowing how to use verbs or adjectives.""
"
"Kwa magaeng a kwa Malaysia, ke letshwao le feng le le rayang gore “tlaa kwano”?","The correct answer is **A: monwana wa bosupa o lebile mo mmeleng**.

The passage explicitly states ""...kwa Malaysia, bobotlana mo go ba letso lwa Ba-Malay kwa magaeng, go raya go re """"tla kwano,"""" go tshwana le monwana wa bosupa o lebile mo mmeleng..."".
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke letshwao lefe le le ka rayang gore “bowa”?","The correct answer is **C: Go tsholetsa letsogo ka seatla se lebile motho yo o mo sadisang sentle**.

The passage specifically mentions that a British traveler in Spain might mistakenly think this gesture (raising a hand with the palm facing the person saying goodbye) means ""come here."" While ""bowa"" isn't explicitly used, the idea of beckoning someone is the same, making option C the most accurate answer.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se se dirileng gore go nne le diphatlha tse di bipilweng ke marogo?","The correct answer is **A: marogo a kapoko**.

The passage states that the moving glacier can cause snow bridges to form, obscuring crevasses. This directly answers the question of what causes crevasses to be hidden.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tseno e e ka bipiwang ke Marogo a kapoko?","The text states: ""Se se kgona go dira go re marogo a kapoko a bipege a bo a sa bonale.""

This translates to: ""This can cause snow bridges to cover and make invisible.""

The text then continues with examples of what can be covered: ""Mabota a magaga a metsi a a gatsetseng a kgona go phutlhama, ebile diphatlha tsa teng di kgona go tswalaga. Ko dithokong tsa kgatselo e, kgatselo tse di tona tla bo di robega, di wela fa fatshe kana di tlola kana di kgokologa go tswa mo matlhakoreng."" - ""The walls of ice caves can collapse, and their cracks can close. At the edges of the glacier, large glaciers will break, fall to the ground or jump or roll from the sides.""

Based on the sentence ""Se se kgona go dira go re marogo a kapoko a bipege a bo a sa bonale"" and the provided options, it is Marogo a kapoko (snow bridges) which covers something, not the other way around.

However, let's analyze the options in relation to the text. The passage mentions that snow bridges can make other objects invisible. Since the only entity listed here which is an object, and therefore can be covered, is diphatlha (cracks).

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is **A: Diphatlha**.
"
"Go ya ka temana,basepedi ba tshwanetse ba batlisise pele ka seemo sa lefelo lefe?","The correct answer is **B: Mafelo a kwa ntle ga Goma**

The text states: ""Le fa Goma e sireletsegile, mesepele epe kwa ntle ga Goma e tshwanetse go batlisisiwe pele ka yone go tlhaloganya seemo jwa ntwa e e tswelelang mo kgaolong ya Kivu Bokone.""

This clearly indicates that trips outside of Goma require prior investigation.
"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e ka se nneng keletso e e siameng go mosepedi mo Goma?,"The correct answer is **A: Dintwa tsa kwa North Kivu di tlosa bodutu**.

Here's why:

*   **P: Goma ke teropo ya bojanala ya lefatshe lwa Democratic Republic of Congo, kwa bofelelong jwa botlhabatsatsi go bapa le lefatshe lwa Rwanda.**(Goma is a tourist city)
*   **Le fa Goma e sireletsegile, mesepele epe kwa ntle ga Goma e tshwanetse go batlisisiwe pele ka yone go tlhaloganya seemo jwa ntwa e e tswelelang mo kgaolong ya Kivu Bokone.**(Even though Goma is safe, trips outside Goma should be investigated due to the war in the Kivu Bokone area.)

    *This implies that the wars are dangerous.*

The other options are all mentioned in the passage as potential benefits of travelling to Goma."
"Teseletso ya go kampa kwa lefelong le le kgakajana, ya letsatsi la ntlha la Phatwe e tsile go nna teng neng?","The correct answer is **B: 1 tsa Moranang**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that permits become available on the 1st of the month, 4 months prior to the month you want to camp.
*   You want to camp starting in August (Phatwe).
*   Counting back 4 months from August: July, June, May, **April**.
*   Therefore, permits for August camping become available on April 1st."
Ke pholisi efe e e beilweng go sireletsa legope?,"The correct answer is **D: Palo ya ditetla ga e ntsi thata**.

The passage states: ""Palo diteseletso ga e ntsi thata ka maiteko a go sireletsa legope..."" which directly translates to ""The number of permits is not very high in an effort to protect the canyon..."".
"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e ka se tsogeng e bonwe kwa mefuteng ya dihotele tse di tlhalositsweng mo temaneng?","The correct answer is **D: Diphaposi tse di ntšhafaditsweng sešeng jaana ka ditlhabololo tsa segompieno.**

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically mentions ""letlhoko la ditlamelo tsa sesha"" (lack of modern amenities) as a characteristic that adds to the hotels' charm. This directly contradicts option D.
*   The other options are all mentioned in the passage as features of these hotels:
    *   A: Bars and fine dining establishments are implied by ""mafelo a maitiso a a haphegileng"" (exclusive entertainment venues) and ""di rekisa dijo tsa maemo a a kwa godimo"" (they sell high-class food).
    *   B: ""di rekisa dijo tsa maemo a a kwa godimo"" - explicitly states high-class restaurants
    *   C: ""kwa go tsone go neng go nna bahumi le batho ba ba itsegeng thata ba nako eo"" - states the accommodation of the wealthy and notable people.

"
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e tlhagisitsweng mo temaneng ke efe ya tse di neelwang mo hoteleng, tse bajanala ba ka se di tseyeng tsia?","The correct answer is **D: Dituelo tsa boroko tse di tlhwatlhwa-tlase**.

Here's why:

* **A: Mekgabiso ya bogologolo** - The passage specifically states that old decorations are part of what makes these hotels appealing.
* **B: Marekisetso a bojelo ka moapei yo o tlhomogileng** - The passage mentions that these hotels often serve high-quality food.
* **C: Mafelo a maitiso a a ntshang bodutu** - The passage mentions that these hotels often have exclusive entertainment venues.
* **D: Dituelo tsa boroko tse di tlhwatlhwa-tlase** - The passage states that these hotels attract wealthy tourists, implying that the accommodation will likely be expensive.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se basepedi ba ba etelang Greenland ba tshwanetseng go se tila?","The correct answer is **D: Go bitsa motho yo o tlholegang kwa Greenland le“Eskimo”**.

The passage explicitly states that while the term ""Eskimo"" may be acceptable in America, it is considered offensive by many non-Americans living in the Arctic, especially Canadians. It also mentions that while you might hear the term used by Greenlanders themselves, it's best for foreigners to avoid using it.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang , e e ka nnang bothata go baetii ba ba etelang Greenland ba sa ipaakanya?","The correct answer is **C: Maemo a bosa (Weather conditions)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Maemo a bosa a a tsididi ke nngwe ya diphatsa tsa nnete tse ba ba sa ipaakanyang batla itemogela tsone."" (Cold weather conditions are one of the real dangers that those who are unprepared will experience).

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Monang o o bidiwang Nordic (A mosquito called Nordic):** The passage mentions that while annoying, they don't carry diseases.
*   **B: Bosenyi (Crime):** The passage states that crime is not common in Greenland.
*   **D: Banni ba selegae (Local residents):** The passage highlights Greenlanders' general acceptance and lack of xenophobia."
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e ga jaana e diriswang jaaka marekelo a konokono?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

The passage states: ""Ga jaana e dirisiwa jaaka marekelo a konokono"" which translates to ""Currently it is used as the main market"" and refers to Jardin de la Unión.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e sa bonweng mo Jardín de la Unión?","The correct answer is **B: Legae la mogaka wa bogologolo wa marato**.

Here's why:

*   **P** clearly states that Callejon del Beso (Mogogoro wa Tladimothwana) ke legae la mogaka wa bogologolo wa marato.

The other options are directly mentioned in the description of Jardín de la Unión:

*   **A:** ""ka thapama le maitseboa ditiragatso koo gantsi di direrelwa ka fa tlase ga moriti wa sekgele.""
*   **C:** ""Go nale mafelo a le mantsi a go ja a a dikaganyeditseng tshingwana""
*   **D:** ""Sebaka seno se ne sa agiwa go nna holo ya baitlami mo lekgolong la bo-17 la dingwaga"""
"Go ya ka temana,ke dife tsa dipolelo tse di latelang ka go palama dithaba ga letsatsi le le lengwe, tse di tsewang di sa nepagala?","The correct answer is **D: Go palama dithaba go tlhoka dipaakanyo tse di oketsegileng mo malapeng a a nang le bana ba bannye**.

The passage *does* say families with young children *may* need additional preparation, but it does *not* say that mountain climbing is *always* demanding for families with young children. The passage states that a day out is *easily achievable* even with infants and toddlers.

The other statements are accurate reflections of what the passage states.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke neng mo go palama dithaba ga letsatsi le le lengwe go sa tlhokeng gore motho a ipaakanye thata?","The correct answer is **A: Fa mopagami a itekanetse mo mmeleng**.

The passage states: ""Go palama dithaba ga letsatsi le le lengwe, ga go tlhoke gore motho a ipaakanye thata, ebile mongwe le mongwe a ka kgona a itumelela se.""  This implies that a one-day hike doesn't require extensive preparation from the hiker. The most relevant requirement is that the hiker is physically fit enough to complete the hike without difficulty.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Fa go dirisiwa tsela e e bonolo** - while a less challenging trail would make a one-day hike easier, the text states a one-day hike doesn't need much preparation.
*   **C: Fa bana ba ya go haeka** - the text states that families with young children need additional preparation.
*   **D: Fa go pagama dithaba go akaretsa go tsamaya mo ditikologong tsa tlhago** - This describes hiking in general, not a specific condition that makes one-day hikes require less preparation."
Ke eng se se farologaneng ka mafelo a a lekalekanang kwa Rogaland le Agder fa go bapiswa le Norway yotlhe?,"The correct answer is **D: Di nna di apesitswe ke ditlhatshana**.

The passage states that in Rogaland and Agder, the areas are often called ""hei,"" meaning treeless areas covered in shrubs. This is the key difference highlighted in the passage compared to the general description of Norwegian highlands.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e ka se tlwaelesegeng ko Norway?","The correct answer is **B: Dithaba tse di nang le ditlhare**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that mountains in Norway, especially those called ""vidde"" or ""hei,"" are typically open, treeless areas. This implies that mountains with trees are not typical in these areas of Norway. The other options are mentioned as common occurrences in Norway."
Bajanala ba ba kgatlhegelang go relela ba tshwanetse go etela lefelo la dithaba neng?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka mariga**.

The passage states that mountain areas offer sports like skiing and snowboarding when they receive sufficient snow, which is during winter. Therefore, tourists interested in skiing should visit during winter.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke neng fa gantsi go nang le bajanala ba bantsi go gaisa kwa lefelong la dithaba?","The correct answer is **C: Ka selemo sa se-India**.

The passage states ""Paka ya bojanala kwa dithabeng, ga ntsi e tlhatloga ka selemo sa se-India."" which translates to ""The tourist season in the mountains, mostly rises in the Indian summer."" Therefore, the peak tourist season is during the Indian summer.
"
O tshwanetse o efoge go dira eng fa o solofela go bona sekepe se batla thuso?,"The correct answer is **D: Go itlhokomolosa batho ba ba kopang go pegiwa mo dikepeng.**

The passage states that you *should* meet people asking for rides and that they will share information with you. Ignoring them would be the opposite of what you should do. All other options are tasks you should be doing.
"
O tshwanetse go dira eng kwa maemelong dikepe fa o batlana le sekepe se se tlhokang thuso?,"The best answer based on the passage is **A: O golagana le batsamaisadikepe**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions ""leka go golagana le batsamaisasekepe mo bareng"" (try to connect with ship captains in the bar). This is a direct instruction.

While talking to many people in general is mentioned (which could imply approaching people cleaning ships or those seeking passage), the most direct and actionable step mentioned in relation to finding a ship is connecting with the captains.

*   **B: Se bonagale** (Don't be visible) is the opposite of what the passage suggests, as it encourages active engagement.

*   **C: Bua le batho fela fa ba phephafatsa dikepe tsa bone** (Only talk to people when they are cleaning their ships) is too restrictive. The passage suggests a broader approach of talking to many people.

*   **D: Ikgatholose batho ba ba kopang go pegiwa mo dikepeng** (Ignore people asking to be boarded) contradicts the instruction to interact with people and gather information. They may have information about ships needing help.
"
Ke lefelo lefe le le ka ngokang mojanala yo a nang le kgatlhego mo ditsong tsa sekolone tsa lefatshe le?,"The correct answer is **A: Ditshitshi tsa Bokone**.

The passage states: ""Bontsi jwa dikago tsa setoropo tsa Hong Kong di kgotlhagane mo lefatsheng le le yang kwa ditshitshing tsa bokone. Se ke lefelo le ma-Boritane a pele ba neng ba le ikgapetse. Ka jalo fa o batla go bona ditso tsa sekolone tsa lefatshe le, o ka simolola gone fa."" This directly links the northern shore with colonial history.
"
"Ke lefelo lefe le le ka gogelang mojanala yo o bayang kwa pele, go bona dilo tse dintle?","The correct answer is **D: The Kowloon waterfront**.

The passage states: ""Go re o bone lefelo la Hong kong sentle, tswa mo setlhakatlhakeng seo, o ye kwa lefelong la Kowloon waterfront, le le mabapi."" (To see Hong Kong properly, leave that island and go to the Kowloon waterfront, which is nearby.) This directly answers the question of where a tourist should go to best see the sights.
"
"Ke eng seo disale tse dingwe di nang le sone, tse di thusang go fokotsa matshwenyego a pabalesego, a lenao la mopagami le ganeletse mo madulong a pitse?","The correct answer is **B: Dinakana tse di babalesegileng**.

The passage explicitly states that ""madulo a pitse, segolo jang a modiro wa kwa ga Mmamosadinyana, a na le dinakana tse di babalesegileng tse motho o ka itshwareleleng ka tsone go letla fa maoto a tsenang teng go wela fatshe fa go gogelwa morago ke mopalami fa a wa."" This directly addresses the safety concern of a rider's foot getting stuck in the stirrup.
"
"Ke eng se se leng mo setlhakong se se faphegileng, se se thusang go oketsa pabalesego ya mopagami fa a dirisa sale ya pitse?","The passage states: ""bontsi jwa bapalami ba rwala ditlhako tse di haphegileng tse di nang le serethe se se sola e borethe e bile e le motsu.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Serethe**.
"
Ke eng se go tweng se ka newa bajanala ka Maharathatha a bojanala?,"The correct answer is **D: Kgolagano le bajanala ba bangwe ba ba etelang lefelo le le lengwe**.

The passage states: ""Go tswa foo, bajanala ba neelwa mekwalo ya pampiri kgotsa e e mo mafaratlhatlheng a enthanete, fa gongwe e patilwe ke bopaki kwa bajanala ba bangwe."" This implies that tourists are sometimes provided with connections or testimonials from other tourists.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya dipolelo tse di latelang tebang le Mafaratlhatlha a bojanala, tse e seng nnete?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **A: Bajanala, ka gale, ba neelwa bopaki ka benggae**.

Lebaka:

Temana e bolela gore bajanala ba neelwa mekwalo ya pampiri kgotsa e e mo mafaratlhatlheng a enthanete, *fa gongwe* e patilwe ke bopaki kwa bajanala ba bangwe. Se ga se supe gore bajanala *ka gale* ba neelwa bopaki ka benggae. Dipolelo tse dingwe tsothe di a dumelana le temana.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke mofuta ofe wa mojanala yo a ka se bonweng mo ntlong ya hosetele, e e kopanetsweng?","The correct answer is **C: Mojanala yo a tsamayang le bana ba bannye**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that families with children are not common in hostels. It suggests that hostels are primarily geared towards younger adults and older travelers."
"Go ya ka temana, ke mang yo, gantsi, a ka nnang kwa hoseteleng?","The correct answer is **B: Batho ba bararo ba dingwaga di le 22 ba tsamaya mmogo.**

Here's why:

*   **P states:** ""Dihosetele thata di lebantswe banana - ba ga ntsi e leng batho ba dingwaga tse di masome a mabedi go ya kwa go a a kwa tlase ga a masome marataro."" This translates to ""Hostels are mostly aimed at young people - mostly people aged in their twenties to under sixty.""

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Balekane ba tsamaya le losea lo lo sa tswang go belegwa (A couple traveling with a newborn baby):** The passage mentions families with children are not common in hostels.
*   **B: Batho ba bararo ba dingwaga di le 22 ba tsamaya mmogo (Three 22-year-olds traveling together):** This fits the description of young people that hostels are aimed at.
*   **C: Balekane ba ba mo dingwageng tsa bo 70 (A couple in their 70s):** The passage indicates older tourists can be found in hostels but youth is a targeted demographic.
*   **D: Malapa a mabedi a a tsamayang le bana ba one (Two families traveling with their children):** Again, the passage mentions families with children are uncommon."
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya dipolelo tse di latelang e e tlhalosang ka nepagalo, go latlhela boomerang?","The correct answer is **D: Ke dibumaring di se kae fela, tse di kgonang go bowa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Bontsi jwa di-boomerang tse di leng teng kwa Australia tota tota ga setse di bowang."" This directly translates to ""Most of the boomerangs that are in Australia really don't come back."" This means only a few boomerangs are capable of returning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ka metlha, e tsile go boela ko letsogong la gago, fa o e konopile sentle:** The passage suggests the opposite, it's that MOST boomerangs don't return, even if thrown well.
*   **B: E ratiwa thata ke benggae go feta bajanala:** The passage says it's popular with tourists, not that it's *more* popular with locals.
*   **C: Ga go na dibumaring tse di leng gone mo Australia:** The passage explicitly states that there ARE boomerangs in Australia."
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e dirisiwang thata mo dijong tsa batho ba Java?","The correct answer is **C: Sukiri e e dirilweng ka khokhonate**.

The passage states that Javanese cuisine ""thatha di remeletse mo tirisong ya...sukiri (bogolo jang sukuri e e dirilweng ka coconut ya Java)..."". This directly supports option C.
"
"Go ya ka temana , bolwetse jo bo tshelanwang, bo fetela jang?","The correct answer is **B: Ditshidinyana**.

The passage states: ""Bolwetsi jo bo tshelanwang bo bakiwa ke ditshidinyana jaaka megare, mothuthuntshwane kgotsa megare e mengwe."" (A disease that is contagious is caused by germs such as viruses, bacteria or other microbes.)
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se se go itseweng se ka se bake bolwetsi jo bo tshwaetsanang?","The correct answer is **A: Meento**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that infectious diseases are caused by microorganisms such as viruses, fungi, or other germs.
*   Vaccinations are designed to *prevent* infectious diseases.

Therefore, vaccines would *not* cause an infectious disease, but rather protect against it."
"Ke mo maemong afe a go tlhopha kemedi ya webo go na le VPN e e sa tlhakanelwang, go lekanenetse modirisi?","Go ya ka polelo P, VPN tse di sa tlhakanelwang di botoka go feta dikemedi tsa webo mo mabakeng a le mantsi.

Ke eng seo se letlang mongwe go dirisa mogala wa setlamo kwa ntle ga fa ba nnang?,"The correct answer is **A: Megala e e mo mafaratlhatlheng a inthanete**.

The passage states: ""Ka gore megala e mo maharathatheng a enthanete, ga go tlhokege go re o dirise mogala wa setlamo sa kwa o nnang teng..."". This directly explains that internet-based phones (megala e mo maharathatheng a enthanete) allow you to use phone services without being tied to a local provider.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se o tlhokang gore se diriwe gore o emetswe ke dinomoro tse di rileng?","The correct answer is **A: Reka nomore y lefatshe lotlhe**

The passage states, ""...gantsi, o tshwanelwa ke go reka nomore ya lefatshe lotlhe kwa thoko e e letlang go re megala PSTN e go leletse."" This directly supports the idea that you need to buy an international number to receive calls.
"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e sa tlhaloseng ka nepagalo, go bitsa mafoko a se-Italy?","The answer is **D: Go bitsa bontsi ba mafoko go farologana go ya ka gore di salwa morago ke tlhaka efe.**

Here's why:

*   **A: Di r tse pedi , di bidiwa ka tsela e e farologaneng le r a le mongwe:** This is stated as being true in the passage.
*   **B: Bontsi jwa mafoko a bitswa fela ka fa a kwadilweng:** This is stated as being true in the passage.
*   **C: Mafoko a ditlhaka c le g a ka go tsietsa:** This is stated as being true in the passage.
*   **D: Go bitsa bontsi ba mafoko go farologana go ya ka gore di salwa morago ke tlhaka efe:** This statement is not true, it is not stated that the rest of the letters depend on the proceeding letter. Only the letters c and g depend on the following letters. Therefore this is the incorrect statement."
Ke dife tsa dibopego tsa Izmir tse di simolotseng pele ga bošeng?,"The correct answer is **D: Marulelo a dithaele tse dikhibidu**.

The paragraph states: ""...mafaratlhatlha a matona, dikago tsa galase ka fa pele le marekisetso a segompieno a kgabisitswe ka marulelo a dithaele tse di khibidu, mmaraka wa lekgolo la bo-18 la dingwaga, mafelo a thapelo le dikereke...""

This implies that the massive infrastructure, glass-fronted buildings, and modern stores are *decorated* with red-tiled roofs, 18th-century markets, places of worship, and churches. This means the red-tiled roofs, markets, places of worship, and churches existed *before* the modern elements.  While the paragraph mentions ""modern stores"", it says the roofs are decorating the stores, meaning the roofs were present before the modern stores.
"
Ke sefe sa tse di latelang se e seng sebopego se se nepagetseng sa Izmir?,"Let's analyze each option based on the provided text:

*   **A: Toropo e ikadile go dikologa kgogometso** - This is explicitly stated in the passage: ""...o o ikadileng go dikologa kgogometso e kgolo...""
*   **B: Go na le seemo le dipopego tse di tlwaelegileng tsa Turkey** - This is also stated: ""...go na le tse di tlwaelegileng tsa Turkey"".
*   **C: O ka bona marekisetso a segompieno le mafelo a thapelo le dikereke** - The passage says: ""dikanego tsa galase ka fa pele le marekisetso a segompieno a kgabisitswe ka marulelo a dithaele tse di khibidu, mmaraka wa lekgolo la bo-18 la dingwaga, mafelo a thapelo le dikereke"", so the statement is correct.
*   **D: E na le boemakepe jwa bobedi ka bogolo** - This is stated in the passage: ""boemakepe jwa bobedi ka bogolo go latela Istanbul"".

Therefore, all the given options are correct descriptions of Izmir according to the text.

However, the question asks which statement is *not* an accurate feature of Izmir. Given that all the statements are accurate according to the passage, there must be an error in the question or the provided options. If we assume the question is valid, then the best possible answer is that all statements are correct and there is no incorrect answer.

**However, since we must pick an answer based on the question, the best approach is to look for the statement that is *least* emphasized or provides the *least* information in the original text**

*   **A:** Being spread around a gulf is a major physical feature of the city as described
*   **B:** Izmir having turkish aspects despite its more mediterranean and european feel is important as it is the reason why izmir can be called part of turkey
*   **C:** This description of what can be found in Izmir is pretty descriptive as it touches on both modern and older parts of the city
*   **D:** Being the second largest port city is a simple, less descriptive, and less important part of describing the city compared to the others.

Based on this analysis, the answer that provides the least information about the city is **D: E na le boemakepe jwa bobedi ka bogolo** since the passage is focused on the city's unique blend of cultures, locations and appearances.
"
"Lefoko, hanami, le kaya go bogela eng?","The correct answer is **A: Dithunya tsa ditšheri**

The passage states: ""Go bogelwa ga dithunya tsa Cherry, mo go itsiweng jaaka hanami..."" which directly translates to ""The viewing of cherry blossoms, which is known as hanami...""
"
Ke mang a neng a tshware meletlo ya ntlha ya go bogela dithunya tsa ditšheri?,"The correct answer is **C: Kgosikgolo ya Japane**.

The passage states: ""Kwa Japane, meletlo ya ntlha ya dithunya tsa dicheri e ne e tshwerwe ke kgosikgolo"". This directly translates to ""In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor"".
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya dintlha tse di latelang tsa Jerusalem tse di ka nneng di a se ngoke bojanala?","The correct answer is **B: Dinaga ka bontsi le United Nations ga di e tseye e le mošate wa Israel**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Jerusalem's religious importance, historical sites, and vibrant markets *attract* tourism. Therefore, options A, C, and D contribute to its appeal.
*   The passage mentions that many countries and the UN don't recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital as a statement of fact, but it doesn't suggest this fact makes the city less appealing to tourists. Tourists are drawn to Jerusalem for other reasons."
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e sa umakiwang jaaka se Jerusalem e itsegeng ka sone?","The correct answer is **B: Tlhotlheletso ya sepolotiki**.

The passage mentions:

*   **A: Ditso tse di kgatlhisang** (ditso tse di kgatlhisang tsa dingwaga tse di diketekete)
*   **C: Botlhokwa jwa tumelo** (Toropo e boitshepho mo ditumelo tsa Judaism, Christianity le Islam)
*   **D: Mafelo a tsa ditso** (Jerusalem e na le mafelo a ditso, dikago tsa bogologolo le tsa ditso)

While the passage mentions the political situation (that many countries don't recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital), it doesn't explicitly say that Jerusalem is *known* for its political influence or significance. The passage mainly highlights its historical, religious, and cultural importance. So political influence is not listed as a reason why Jerusalem is ""known""."
"Go ya ka temana, ke mothale ofe wa mojanala yo a ka se ungwelweng ke go reka Wild Card?","The correct answer is **B: Motho yo o etelang Kruger National Park fela**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that the Wild Card allows access to *multiple* parks in South Africa.
*   If someone is *only* visiting Kruger National Park, the Wild Card would not be beneficial as it would not be used at any other park.
*   Option A, C and D would find the Wild card beneficial, depending on frequency of visit and parks to be visited."
"Ke efe polelo e e sa tlhaloseng ka nepagalo,Kruger National Park?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **C: Ke e nnye thata mo diphakeng tsa bosetšhaba tsa Aforika Borwa.**

Polelo e a e tlhalositseng e re KNP e botona ja dikhilomithara di ka nna 19,500 km², se se supa gore ga se phaka e nnye. Ka jalo, polelo e e sa tlhaloseng ka nepagalo ke ya gore e nnye thata.
"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e ka nnang kotsi thata go bapagami go ralala dikarolo tse di motlhatlogo thata?","The passage specifically states: ""itlhokomele mo dikarolong tse di motlhatlogo thata, segolobogolo jang fa go le metsi, e re ka go ka nna kotsi ka bonako."" This directly links wet conditions (maemo a a bongola) to being dangerous on the steep sections.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Maemo a a bongola**
"
"Ke dife tsa dipolelo tseno, tse di sa bontsheng ka nepagalo, go ya kwa godimo ga thaba ya Machu Picchu jaaka di tlhalositswe mo temaneng?","The correct answer is **B: Ga go na tshegetso ya matshwaro a diatla go ralala dikarolo tse di motlhatlogo thata.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""mo dikarolong tse di tlhatlogelelang thata tsa megala ya tshipi di neelana ka tshegetso ya matshwaro a diatla"" which directly contradicts option B.

The other options are true according to the passage:

*   **A: Le bapagami ba ba itekanetseng tota, ba ka nne ba felelwa ke mowa** - The passage says: ""Ka go rialo, solofela go felelwa ke mowa"".
*   **C: O tshwanetse go feta mo logageng kwa setlhoeng** - The passage says: ""Go na le logaga lo lo nnye gaufi le kwa setlhoeng se o tshwanetse go feta ka sone"".
*   **D: Dikarolo tse di motlhatlogo di nna kotsi fa go le metsi** - The passage says: ""o itlhokomele mo dikarolong tse di motlhatlogo thata, segolobogolo jang fa go le metsi, e re ka go ka nna kotsi ka bonako""."
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya tsone e e sa itsegeng ka dijo tse di ratwang thata tsa Ma-Jorca?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **C: Dithoro**.

Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e sa umakiwang jaaka tsela e e tlwaelesegileng ya go gotetsa khuti ya hangi?,"Kganetso ke **A: Gase**.

"
Ke eng se se ka dirang gore o lemogiwe ke monna wa phuthego kgotsa mosadi wa phuthego ka tsela e e kgethegileng?,"The correct answer is **A: Go rwala serwalo sa mebala e e phatsimang**.

The passage states: ""...fela fa otla ka sa gago, segolothata sa mebala e e phatshimang, wa go bona monyenyoo gotswa go banna mo phuthegong kgotsa basadi ba phuthego kwa kgorong."" This directly implies that wearing a brightly colored headscarf will get you noticed and a smile from members of the congregation.
"
Ke efe ya diaparo tse di latelang e e ka nneng ya se nne gone go adima mo mafelong a kobamelo? ,"The passage states that worship places lend out dresses (mesese) and shorts (marokgwe a makhutswane). The passage also states that they lend out wraps (dirwalo) if you do not have your own.

The passage mentions that men should wear pants (marokgwe) that cover their knees, and that these are available to borrow.

Therefore, the answer is **C: Marokgwe** (pants).
"
Moeng a ka nna le ditšhono tse dintsi neng go itumelela dinaledi fa a etetse mafelo a kwa Antarctic?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka mariga**.

The passage explicitly states that in the Arctic or Antarctic during winter, you experience constant night, which provides a great opportunity to see the stars.
"
Ke neng foo mogala wa sethelaete o ka se kgoneng go emisetsa mogala wa letheka?,"The correct answer is **A: Fa mogala o o bonalang sentle kwa sethelaeteng o ka nne wa kgoreletsega**.

The passage states that a satellite phone doesn't replace a cell phone because ""o tla tshwanelwa ke go re o bo o le kwa ntle ka mogala o o bonalang sentle kwa sathalaeteng go re o letse mogala.""  This implies that if there's an obstruction preventing a clear line of sight to the satellite, the phone won't work.
"
Ke neng foo mogala wa sethelaete e ka nnang one o dirisiwang go na le mogala wa selula?,"The correct answer is **B: Mo loetong ka mokoro**.

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""Mo mafelong a a kwa tennyana-teng, kwa go se nang maranyane a mogala wa cellular, mogala wa satalaete e ka nna fela o ne o o ka o dirisang."" (In remote locations where there is no cellular phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only one you can use.)
* **P also states:** ""Tirelo e dirisiwa gangwe le gape ke ba dikepe, go akaretsa ba dikepe tsa go ijesa monate..."" (The service is used frequently by ships, including pleasure boats...)

Option B, ""Mo loetong ka mokoro"" (On a boat trip), aligns with these statements, as boats often travel in remote areas far from cellular towers. The other options describe scenarios where a satellite phone is less likely to be necessary.
"
"Kgotlhang ka efe ya tse di latelang, e tlhodile boikemelo jwa Transnistria Republic?","The correct answer is **B: Matso**.

The passage states ""...Naga ya Moldova ke rephaboliki ya batho ba matso a a farologaneng, e e kileng tsa tshwenngwa ke dikgotlhang tsa semorafe. Ka ngwaga wa 1994, kgotlhang e e tlhodile boikemelo jwa Transinistria Republic..."" This clearly indicates that ethnic (matso) conflicts led to the independence of Transnistria.
"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang,e Transnistria Republic e nang le yone, e e farologaneng le Moldova yotlhe?  ","The correct answer is **D: Madi a naga ya teng**

The passage explicitly states ""Transinistria Republic...kwa go nang le puso e e leng ya yona le madi a naga ya teng, mme fela ga tlhomamisiwa ke leloko lepe la UN."" This clearly indicates that Transnistria has its own currency, distinct from Moldova.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke neng fa moeti a ka etelang Montevideo fa a solofela go tila maemo a phefo e e fokang?","The correct answer is **C: Ka dikgwedi tsa selemo tsa Bokone jwa Hemisefere**. Here's why:

* **The Passage:** The passage states that when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it's summer in Montevideo. It also says that in Montevideo's summer months, temperatures are typically above +30°C. While the passage mentions wind and humidity making winter feel colder, it doesn't indicate strong winds are typical during other times.
* **Eliminating other options:**
    * **A: Ka dikgwedi tsa mariga tsa Bokone jwa Hemisefere** This is winter in Montevideo, when the passage mentions the wind and humidity makes it feel colder than it actually is.
    * **B: Ka paka ya komelelo kwa Montevideo:** The passage explicitly states there are no distinct ""wet"" or ""dry"" seasons in Montevideo.
    * **D: Ka dikgwedi tsa mariga tsa Montevideo:** This is when the passage states the wind and humidity makes it feel colder than it actually is.

Therefore, the best time to visit Montevideo to avoid the ""wind chill"" effect mentioned in the passage is during its summer, which corresponds to the Northern Hemisphere's winter.
"
"Go ya ka temana, moeti o tshwanetse go etela Montevideo neng fa ba kgatlhegela maemo a bosa a a tsiditsana?","The passage states: ""E re ka Montevideo e le kwa borwa jwa Equator, go selemo koo fa e le mariga kwa Bokone jwa Hemisefere le ka go refosana jalo. Mariga a ka nna tsididi thata ka bolotsana...""

This means Montevideo experiences winter when it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa. Therefore, to experience cooler weather in Montevideo, a visitor should go when it's summer in the Northern Hemisphere. So the answer is B.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke sefe sa tse di latelang, se se amanngwang le bataki ba mekwalokwalo ya mabota go na le tshenyo ya didiriswa tsa botlhe le tsa poraefete?","The correct answer is **A: Mekete ya mekwalo ya mabota**.

The passage states: ""Matsatsing a go na le bataki ba mekwalokwalo ya mabota, mekete ya mekwalokwalo ya mabota le ”mabota a a mo molaong”. Mekwalokwalo ya mabota e ntseng jaana, ka dinako tse dingwe e tsewa jaaka botaki jo e seng tshenyo...""

This clearly links graffiti festivals (mekete ya mekwalokwalo ya mabota) with a more accepted form of graffiti art that is *not* considered vandalism.  The other options are either general descriptions of graffiti or an outcome (art instead of vandalism), but *not* something specifically associated with the artists *instead* of vandalism.
"
Ke ntlha efe ya meletlo eo batho ba ba e tseneng ba tsayang e le botlhokwa thata mo moletlong oo?,"The correct answer is **B: Meletlo e na le dikampa**.

The passage states: ""Bontsi jwa batho ba ba tseneng meletlo mengwe ba swetsa go kampa kwa meletlo e tshwaretsweng teng, mme bontsi jwa bone ba tsaya go dira jalo go le botlhokwa thata mo moletlong o o."" This translates to ""The majority of people attending some festivals choose to camp at the festivals, and the majority of them consider doing so to be very important to the festival.""
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng seo motho yo o tsenelang meletlo a tshwanetseng go se dira pele fa a batla go nna gaufi le ditiragalo?","The correct answer is **D: O tla nako e sa le teng**.

The passage states: ""Ha o batla go nna gaufi le ditiragalo go batla o tla nako e sale teng go re o kgone go bona lefelo la boroko gaufi le ko mmino o teng."" This directly translates to ""If you want to be close to the events, try to arrive early so you can find a place to stay close to where the music is.""
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke kae moo go sa siamelang baeng fa ba batla go itlosa bodutu bosigo kwa bokone jwa New Mexico?","The correct answer is **B: Dibara tsa metsana e mennye**.

The passage explicitly states that ""dibara tsa ditoropo tse dinnye mono di kgona go sa nneng mafelo a a siametseng moeng o o tswang go sele."" (The bars in the small towns might not be suitable places for a visitor from elsewhere.)
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke kae moo moeng a ka nneng a bona mafelo a a itsegeng a maitiso mo bokone jwa New Mexico?","The correct answer is **C: Kwa dikhasinong, gaufi le Sante Fe**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""bontsi ja mafelo a itloso boduto a di casino a a umakilweng fa godimo, a rekisa bojalwa; e bile mangwe mo go one a dirisa didirisiwa tsa maina a a tumileng go natefisa maitiso (bogolo jang mo go tse di tona tse di gaufi le Albuquerque le Santa Fe)."" (many of the casinos mentioned above sell alcohol; and some use big-name entertainment to enhance the experience (especially the big ones near Albuquerque and Santa Fe).

This explicitly connects big-name entertainment (and thus more well-known venues) with casinos *near* Albuquerque and Santa Fe."
Baeng ba ba se nang madi a mantsi ba ka batla go se nwe mofuta ofe wa nno?,"The passage states:

*   ""Bojalwa jwa konokono jwa selegae ke 'Number One', ga se bojalwa jo bo dingalo, mme gone bo a itumedisa e bile bo a lapolosa."" - Local beer is not expensive, but it is tasty and refreshing.
*   ""Dino tsa matute a maungo di a tura mme gone di monate tota."" - Fruit juices are expensive but very delicious.
*   ""Mefine e mentsi ya kwa Fora e e ka nowang, mme mefine ya kwa New Zealand le Australia eka nna botoka.."" - French wines are available, but wines from New Zealand and Australia are better.
*   ""Metsi a pompo a mo lefelong a sireletsegile go ka a nwa, mme gone metsi a mo dibotlolong a motlhofo go bonwa fa e le go re o a tshaba."" - Tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are afraid.

Therefore, the best option for budget-conscious travelers is local beer.

The correct answer is **C: Bojalwa ba selegae**
"
"Go ya ka lefelo le le tlhalositsweng mo temaneng, ke efe ya di otara tsa dino e e ka tlhakatlhakanyang batho ba ba tsamaisang dijo?","The correct answer is **D: kofi e e tshetsweng mashi a lobese**.

The passage explicitly states that drinking ""kofi e e tshetsweng mashi a lobese (e a tleng ”flat white”)"" is uncommon for Australians. Therefore, ordering a flat white would likely confuse or surprise the locals. The other options are either local drinks (Number One), a wine likely to be appreciated, or espresso, which aligns with what the locals drink.
"
"Mokgwa wa go thopa, yo o neng wa tsaya lobaka lwa makgolo a mararo a dingwaga, o ne wa simolola ke setlhopha sefe sa batho?","The correct answer is **D: Ma-spain**

The passage states, ""Batho ba Spain ba ne ba simolola motlha wa go thopa o o neng wa tsaya lobaka lwa makgolo a le mararo a dingwaga."" This directly translates to ""The Spanish began the era of conquest that lasted three centuries.""
"
"Go ya ka temana,gore o kgone go tseega sentle fa o le kwa Paris, o tshwanetse o dire eng?","The correct answer is **C: Itshware sentle**.

The passage states: ""go re o kgone go tseega sentle fa o le ko Paris, go batla o itshwara sentle, ka maitsholo a ba a bitsang ”bien élevé” (go godisiwa sentle)."" This translates to: ""In order to be well-received in Paris, you need to behave well, with manners they call 'bien élevé' (well-raised).""

Option D is also a good answer, but option C is more general and reflects the overall idea of the passage.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e sa tseweng jaaka kakanyetso e e sa lolamang ka batho ba Paris?","Karabo e nepahetseng ke **D: A a tshosang.**

Temana e re maikutlo a a latelang ke dikakanyetso tse di sa lolamang ka Ma-Paris:

Melemo ya Maemo a ntlha mo MetroRail ya Cape Town ke eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Ga e a tlala**

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states: ""Ke itumeletse Metroplus e bile gape ga e a tlala"" (I enjoy Metroplus and also it is not crowded).
*   The passage also mentions that MetroPlus is more expensive.

The other options are incorrect based on the information provided."
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se diterena tsotlhe tsa Cape Town di nang le sone?","The correct answer is **D: Letoroko la Maemo a Ntlha gammogo le a Boraro** because the passage states: ""Diterena tsotlhe di na le matoroko a ka bobedi MetroPlus le Metro"".
"
Ke sefe sa tse di latelang se setshedi se ka nneng sa se se dire?,"The correct answer is **B: Malwetse a ilwang ke mmele** and **C: Gasagasa tshwaetsego**.

The passage states: ""Ditshidi di kgona go senya dijo, di baka go serega, kgotsa mo mabakeng a a sa solofelang di baka malwetse a a ilwang ke mmele, go atisa botlhole, kgotsa go gasagasa tshwetsego.""

*   **A: Baka bogwata** - This is not directly mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: Malwetse a ilwang ke mmele** - This is directly mentioned as one of the effects.
*   **C: Gasagasa tshwaetsego** - This is directly mentioned as one of the effects.
*   **D: Go gobatsa** - The passage specifically excludes animals that can cause injury. ""Diphologotswana tseo ka gale ga di akaretse malwetsi a anamang motlhofo kgotsa diphologolo tse di borai tse di kgonang go gobatsa kgotsa go bolaya.""
"
Dikarata tsa prepaid tsa mesokelatsebeng di ka rekiwa kae?,"The correct answer is **C: Mo mabenkeleng a mannye**.

The first sentence of the paragraph states: ""Mabenkele otlhe a mannye a na le tlhakantshuke ya dikarata tsa pre-paid tsa mesokelatsebeng..."" which translates to ""All small shops have a selection of pre-paid telephone cards...""
"
Dielo tse di sologelang molemo di neelana jang ka dikarata dingwe?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka dinomoro tsa mogala tse di sa duelelweng**.

The passage states: ""Go bona ditirelo tseno ga ntsi go ka bonwa ka tiriso ya nomore ya mogala e e sa duelelweng..."" (Access to these services is often found by using a toll-free phone number...)
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya ditlhare tse di latelang e e sa tlwaelegang thata mo phakeng ya Plitvice Lakes ya bosetšhaba?","Karabo e nepagetseng ke **B: Moakere**.

Temana e umaka ditlhare tsa beech, spruce le fir e le tse di tletseng mo phakeng ya Plitvice Lakes. Moakere ga e umakwa, ka jalo ke karabo e e sa tlwaelegang thata.
"
Ke eng ya diphologolo tse di latelang tse di sa tlwaelesegang tse di ka bonwang mo phakeng ya Plitvice Lakes?,"The correct answer is **D: Capercaillie**.

The passage specifically mentions that ""diphologolo tse di sa bonaleng motlhofo jaaka...capercaillie di ka bonwa teng"" (animals that are not easily seen such as...capercaillie can be found there). The other options (Turkey, Matshwane, Cassowary) are not mentioned in the text.
"
"Go ya ka temana,dikhoutu tsa lefelo totatota, di thusa ka eng?","The correct answer is **B: Taolo mo mebarakeng**.

The passage explicitly states that the real purpose of region codes is to give companies more control over their markets, which translates to market control. While option C is mentioned as the *claimed* purpose, the passage argues that it is not the *actual* purpose.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya tse di latelang tse e seng nnete , tse di bolelwang ka dikhoutu tsa lefelo ke dikomponi tsa metswedi ya tshedimosetso?","The passage says media companies claim region codes are a way to ""prevent piracy."" The passage then argues that this is untrue. Therefore, the statement ""They help prevent illegal copying"" is what media companies claim, but the passage argues is false.

The correct answer is **B: Di thusa go tila go kopolola mo go seng ka fa molaong**
"
"Fa o boela mo lefatsheng la gaeno,ke tsmaiso efe, e ka tlwaelo, e seng ya semmuso?","The best answer is **A: Go phuruphutsha ga ba lephata la mosepele**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt (P) focuses on the fact that travel departments do not often search people when returning. Therefore, a common, unofficial procedure is the search performed by the travel department.**

The other options are less directly related to the prompt's emphasis on infrequent searches by travel departments:

*   **B: Netefatsa gore o itse se se letleletsweng le se se sa letlelelwang**: This is related, but is a more generally stated request.
*   **C: Seelo se se beilweng sa dilo**: This refers to legal limits, but the question asked for an informal common procedure.
*   **D: Ba taolo ya dithoto**: The prompt contrasts the travel department to customs officers, therefore this is not a good answer."
Ke sefe sa tse di latelang seo o tshwanetseng go se itse pele o boela mo lefatsheng la gaeno?,"The best answer is **D: Fa nngwe ya dilo tse o di tsenyang di sa letlelelwa.**

Here's why:

* **The original text P emphasizes knowing what is allowed and what is not.** While reporting excess quantities is important (mentioned in B), knowing what is fundamentally prohibited is a more critical piece of information *before* returning.  Bringing a prohibited item can lead to serious consequences regardless of quantity.

Let's look at why the other options are less ideal:

* **A: Fa go ka nna le lefelo la go phuruphutsha fa motho a boela mo lefatsheng la gaabo:** While understanding customs procedures is helpful, it's less critical than knowing what's allowed to bring in the first place. The existence of search locations doesn't tell you what's prohibited.
* **B: Fa o tlhoka go bega tsotlhe tse di bontsi jo bo fetang seelo se se beilweng ka fa molaong:** This is important, but it's secondary to knowing what's allowed at all. You can't report something that is outright banned.
* **C: Fa go nna le taolo ya dithoto:** Knowing about customs control existence is not directly related to what you are able to take.

Therefore, understanding which items are prohibited is the most crucial information to have *before* returning to your country.

"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se se leng ka bontsi, se se kgontshang bapagami go atisa go ipetlela ditsela tse diša mo teng ga Cochamó Valley?","The correct answer is **D: Mabota (Walls)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Bapagami go tswa ntlheng tse nne tsa lefatshe, ba atisitse go ipetlela ditsela tse disha, go itsa go kganelwa ke mantswe a motona."" This translates to: ""Climbers from all four corners of the world often forge new paths to avoid being blocked by *massive walls*.""  The 'massive walls' (mantswe a motona) are what necessitate the creation of new routes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go bona mafelo (To see places):** While seeing places is likely a motivation for climbers, it's not what *forces* them to create new routes.
* **B: Ditlhoa (Peaks):** The peaks offer attractive views, but the passage specifically mentions avoiding walls.
* **C: Mafelo a a kgatlhisang (Interesting places):** Similar to option A, interesting places are a motivator, not the obstacle requiring new routes.
"
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e neilweng mo temaneng, ke mang yo a fetang mo makgabaganyong a mantsi mo Sephatlong sa Borwa?","The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance**.

The passage states: ""Mme gone, Star Alliance e tsamaya gotlhe kwa ntle ga botlhaba jwa Borwa jwa Pacific go tswa kwa Santiago de Chile go ya kwa Tahiti..."". This indicates that Star Alliance covers most of the Southern Hemisphere, except for one specific gap. The passage also mentions that SkyTeam doesn't pass through any of the intersections in the Southern Hemisphere. Therefore, Star Alliance covers more intersections.
"
"Ke kgolagano efe ya difofane, e e fetang mo palong e nnye thata ya makgabaganyo mo Sephatlong sa Borwa?","The passage states that Star Alliance goes everywhere except for the south-eastern Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti (which is a LATAM Oneworld flight). It also states that SkyTeam doesn't pass through any of the three crossings in the Southern Hemisphere. Therefore, the airline alliance that passes through the fewest crossings in the Southern Hemisphere is SkyTeam.

However, SkyTeam is not an answer option, but the correct answer is **D: SkyTeam**. But since the passage focuses on Star Alliance and LATAM Oneworld as options, it might be inferring that **C: LATAM Oneworld** is the best answer because it only has the single route in the southeast pacific."
"Ke mokgatlho ofe o o dirang tiro ya go bontsha bajanala lefelo , o o tlileng morago ga Global Running Tours?","The correct answer is **B: Go Running Tours**.

The passage states that ""Motlhatlhami wa Globala Running Tours, Go Running Tours..."" which means Go Running Tours came after Global Running Tours.
"
"Go ya ka temana, Go Running Tours e thusa go golaganya ditlhopha di le kae tse di farologaneng tsa batabogi?","The correct answer is **C: Lesome-le-bobedi**

The passage states: ""Motlhatlhami wa Globala Running Tours, Go Running Tours o golaganya ditlhopha di le lesome-le-bobedi tsa batlamedi ba batabogi ba lefelo mo dikontinenteng di le nne."" (The successor to Globala Running Tours, Go Running Tours connects twelve groups of local running suppliers across four continents.)
"
Mojanala o tshwanetse a dire eng fa a solofela go bona letose sentle?,"The correct answer is **C: Didiriswa tsa go bonela kgakala** (Binoculars).

The passage states: ""Ditau, dinkwe le matotse di na le ditlhong nako dingwe mme o ka se bona botoka fa o dirisa dibonela-kgakala."" This directly translates to ""Lions, leopards and cheetahs are shy sometimes and you can see them better if you use binoculars.""
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mofuta ofe wa phologolo o moeng a ka nneng a kopana le one ka nako ya leeto ka koloi?","The correct answer is **B: Dithutlwa**.

The passage states, ""Diphologolo dingwe, jaaka ditlou le dithutlwa, di rata ga atamela dikoloi..."" (Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, like to approach vehicles...).
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se se ka dirang gore leeto le nne tlhwatlhwatlase?","The correct answer is **B: Kopana le batho ba bangwe, le itireng segopana sa batho ba le bane**.

The passage states ""Maeto a tlhwatlhwatlase fa batho ba itirile segopana, ka jalo fa o le mongwe kgotsa le tsala e le nngwe fela, leka go kopana le batho ba bangwe le itireng segopana sa batho ba le bane go fitlha go ba le barataro, le kgone go bona seelo se se botoka sa motho ka mongwe."" This directly indicates that forming a group of four to six people results in lower travel costs.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mang yo o ka nneng a bona seelo se se gaisang sa leeto?","The passage states that the ""best rate per person"" is achieved with a group of four to six people. Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **D: Segopa sa batho ba le batlhano** (A group of five people)"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se se dirileng gore San Francisco e itsege lefatshe ka bophara?","The correct answer is **A: Go supiwa thata ga yone mo botaking bo bo farologaneng le mo dibukeng**.

The passage states: ""Go supiwa thata ga yone mo mminong, mo difiliming, mo di dibukeng le ka kakaretso fela, di dirile gore toropo eno e itsege lefatshe ka bophara."" This directly links the city's prominence in arts and literature to its global recognition.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke dife tsa dipolelo ka San Francisco tse e seng nnete?","Karabo e nepagetseng ke **D: Itsholelo e remeletse mo bojanaleng.**

Le fa temana e bolela gore San Francisco e na le bojanala jwa maemo a a kwa godimo, gape e bolela gore itsholelo ya yone e kabakanye le gore babereki ka bontsi ba tswa mo maphateng a mangwe a le mantsi kwantle ga bojanala. Ka jalo, ga go nnete go bolela gore itsholelo ya yone e remeletse mo bojanaleng fela. Dikgetho tse dingwe di nepahetse go ya ka temana.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke mofuta ofe wa mojanala yo a ka nneng a se bone molemo wa go dirisa ditirelo tsa barulaganyi ba mesepele?","The correct answer is **B: Le fa ka dinako dingwe go na le kgonagalo ya gore o iponele mefuta e mengwe ya boroko, jaaka go kampa.**

Here's why:

The passage mentions that travel agents often work with specific hotels, but sometimes can help arrange alternative accommodations like camping. This implies that a traveler specifically interested in unique accommodations like camping *might* not benefit as much from a travel agent who primarily focuses on hotels.  The other options highlight benefits offered by travel agents (needing time to think, visa assistance, all-inclusive packages), suggesting travelers in those situations would likely find value in using one.
"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e sa umakiwang mo temaneng e le molemo wa go beeletsa ka barulaganyi ba mesepele?","Let's analyze each option against the passage:

*   **A: Rulaganya dipampiri tse dingwe tsa mesepele, jaaka Visa:** The passage mentions that you might need time to arrange travel documents like a visa *after* a travel agent provides you with a quote. This is something *you* do, not something the travel agent does *for* you. So, this is a reason why using the agent might not be useful.

*   **B: Barulaganya-mesepele ba dirisanya le dihotele dingwe tse di rileng:** This is mentioned in the passage.

*   **C: Maeto a a akaretsang tsotlhe:** The passage states that travel agents often sell trips including meals, transportation, and sometimes flights and hotels - essentially ""all-inclusive"" packages.

*   **D: Ba kgona go go tshegeletsa kopo:** This is directly mentioned in the passage: ""Ba kgona go go tshegeletsa kopo ya gago fa o tlhoka nako gore o ikakanye..."".

Therefore, the correct answer is **A**.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se ditiriso tsa thanolo ya mafoko tse di direlang ka bonako di sa kgoneng go se dira?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **D: Go ranolola ka nepagalo, ka dinako tsotlhe.**

Temana e tlhalosa gore le mororo dienjene tsa thanolo di tokafaditswe thata, di santse di ka dira diphoso. Se se kaya gore ga di kgone go ranola ka nepagalo *ka dinako tsotlhe*. Dikgetho tse dingwe tsotlhe di tlhalosiwa jaaka tse di kgonagalang.
"
Ke eng se se kgontshang thanolo go dirwa go se na inthanete?,"The correct answer is **C: Laisolola tshedimosetso ya puo e o e batlang**.

The passage states, ""...Google Translate, e e go letlang go ranolela o se mo inthanete morago ga go re o laisolole tshedimosetso ya puo e o e batlang."" This directly indicates that downloading the language information is what enables offline translation.
"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e sa iseng kapoko kwa tlase?","The correct answer is **A: Kapoko e a kgomarela**.

Here's why:

The passage explains that avalanches happen when too much snow accumulates on a mountainside. Options B, C, and D are all listed as triggers or causes that can *dislodge* snow and cause an avalanche. The sentence mentions ""Di-avalanche ke dilo tsa tlholego; go na le seelo sa selekanyo sa kapoko se se kgonang go nna mo letlhakoreng la thaba. Ga kapoko e nna ntsi thata, e nngwe e kgokologa le thaba e le avalanche"". *Kapoko e a kgomarela* (Snow is sticky/adhesive) is the reason why snow *doesn't* naturally fall off the mountain. It prevents avalanches until another factor triggers them.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke dife tsa tse di latelang, tse di kgokologang e le diavalanche?","The correct answer is **C: Kapoko e ntsi thata mo letlhakoreng la thaba**

The passage states: ""Ga kapoko e nna ntsi thata, e nngwe e kgokologa le thaba e le avalanche."" This directly indicates that an excess of snow on a mountainside leads to avalanches.
"
"Go ya ka temana,kheri e dirilwe ka didiriswa dife?","The correct answer is **B: Ditlhatsana le dipaese**.

The passage states: ""Khari ke dijo tse di dirilweng ka ditlhatsana le dipaese, ga mmogo le nama kgotsa merogo."" This directly translates to: ""Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, as well as meat or vegetables.""
"
"Mo dikgaolong tse dingwe, mašwi a coconut a dirisiwa, ka dinako dingwe, mo legatong la sediriswa se feng mo kharing?","The correct answer is **C: Yogurt**.

The passage states that ""Kwa borwa jwa India le mafelo a mangwe a a fa lewatleng, go dirisiwa maswi a coconut thata."" and ""Mo mafelong a a kgakajana le lewatle kwa bokone jwa India le Pakistan, yogurt e dirisiwa mo di sopong tsa khari.""

This implies that coconut milk is used in some regions instead of yogurt.
"
Goreng go dikologa dithaba go tlhokega go ya kwa phitlhelelong?,"Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **ga go na karabo e e nepagetseng mo dikgethong tse di fa godimo**.

Potso e botsa gore goreng tsela e dikologa dithaba. Tekiseteng, e re ""ga se motsamo o o bonolo, se se raya gore tsela ya teng e dikologa dithaba go fitlhela ko phitlhelelong."" Polelo e, e supa gore go dikologa dithaba ke karolo ya mathata a tsela, mme ga e re neele lebaka le le tlhamaletseng la gore goreng e dikologa dithaba. Dikgetho tse dingwe ga di amane le potso e.
"
"Go bapa le South Pole Traverse (kgotsa Tselakgolo), ke eng se se tshwailweng ka difolaga?","The correct answer is **C: Diphatlha tse di katetsweng kapoko**.

The passage states ""Ke kapoko e e gatisitsweng le diphatlha tse di katetsweng le go tshwaiwa ka difolaga"". This clearly indicates that the crevasses (diphatlha) are marked with flags.
"
Ke eng se se sa umakiwang mo temaneng e le sengwe se bajanala ba tshwanetseng go se ela tlhoko fa ba etela mo borwa jwa Aforika?,"The correct answer is **C: Mo e ka nnang mafatshe otlhe a a bapileng le borwa jwa Aforika a tletse thitibalo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that while Southern Africa **generally** has stability, **not all** countries in the region do. Option C states that nearly all countries are stable, which contradicts the passage.
*   Options A, B, and D are all directly supported by information presented in the passage."
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se se ka tsewang e le keletso e e sa siamang go bajanala ba ba batlang go tlhotlhomisa borwa jwa Aforika ka koloi?","The correct answer is **B: Se se ka dirwa ka koloi nngwe le nngwe fa e dirisiwa ka matsetseleko, le fa 4x4 e le maleba**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that while any car *can* be used with care, a 4x4 is *highly recommended* because many places are only accessible with a high-clearance 4x4 vehicle. Implying that any car is suitable creates an unrealistic expectation and disregards the limitations of non-4x4 vehicles.

The other options are accurate reflections of the passage's content:

*   **A:** The passage mentions that each country has its own requirements for emergency equipment in vehicles.
*   **C:** The passage states that traveling by car provides access to off-the-beaten-path locations.
*   **D:** The passage warns that not all countries in Southern Africa are stable."
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e sa umakiwang mo temaneng e le kotsi e e ka tlisiwang ke gore o kgaogane le dibeke tsa gago?,"The correct answer is **C: Di ka tsewa gore ke tsa motho o mongwe**

Let's break down why:

*   **A: Di ka utswiwa** - The text explicitly states ""Dibeke tse di sa tlhokomelwang di ke tsone tse di utswiwang motlhofo"" (Unattended bags are easily stolen).
*   **B: O ka nna wa iphitlhela o dirisitswe go rwala ditagi o sa itse** - The text says ""O se ka wa tsamaya wa kgaogana le dibeke tsa ga go...O ka nna wa iphitlhela o dirisitswe go rwala ditagi o sa itse"" (Don't part with your bags...You might find yourself being used to carry drugs unknowingly).
*   **D: Baokamedi ba lefelo ba ka belaela, bogolo thata jang fa go kile ga nna le matshosetsi a dibomo** - The text states ""dibile di kgona go belaetsa baokamedi ba lefelo bogolo thata jang fa go kile ga nna le matshosetsi a dibomo"" (they tend to raise suspicion among local authorities, especially if there have been bomb threats).

The text does *not* mention the possibility of your bags being mistaken for someone else's. Therefore, C is the correct answer."
Ke eng se se sa umakiwang mo temaneng tebang le go rwala ditagi?,"The correct answer is **D: Baokamedi ba ka go amoga dibeke, le fa o sa tsamaise ditagi**

Here's why:

*   **A:** The passage explicitly mentions that in some countries, even a first-time drug offense can result in the death penalty.
*   **B:** The passage emphasizes being careful when crossing borders.
*   **C:** The passage mentions that drug-sniffing dogs can be used at any time without warning.
*   **D:** The passage states that unattended bags are easily stolen and can arouse suspicion, especially after bomb threats. However, it doesn't mention that authorities can confiscate bags, even if you're not carrying drugs."
"Ke mofuta ofe wa seno, o o sa umakiwang e le sengwe se o ka lekang go se dira kwa gae fa o na o le nosi?","The correct answer is **C: Biri**.

The passage mentions making coffee, tea, juice, and smoothies at home. It then suggests going to a bar if you live in a city with different drinking cultures, implying that you might drink something there that you don't typically make at home. Bars commonly serve beer, which isn't mentioned as something to make at home.
"
"Ke dife tsa tse di latelang, tse o tshwanetseng o di etele fa o le nosi, fa toropo ya gago e itsege ka mokgwa wa yone wa go nwa bojalwa?","The correct answer is **C: Diphabo tse o sa yeng go tsone kgapetsa**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly suggests that if your city is known for its drinking culture, you should ""ikele kwa bareng kgotsa phapo e e fa gaufi e o se keng o ya ko go yone kgapetsa"" (go to a bar or pub nearby that you don't visit often). This directly supports option C. The other options are mentioned in the passage but not specifically in the context of being alone in a city with a strong drinking culture.
"
Maphoi a a betlilweng a beilwe kae?,"The correct answer is **B: Mo jarateng ya kereke**.

The passage states: ""Mo jarateng ya kereke, gona le maphoi a a kgatlhisang, a a betwileng ka mmabole, fa godimo ga mabitla a mangwe."" (In the churchyard, there are interesting dove sculptures, carved from marble, on top of some graves.)
"
Ke mofuta ofe wa visa o o ka tlhokang gore mongwe a tlamele bopaki jwa tshegetso e e lekaneng ka madi?,"The correct answer is **D: Visa ya go ithuta (Student visa)**.

The passage specifically states: ""Gape o tla tshwanelwa ke go ntsa sesupo sa go re o na le madi a go ituelela sekolo le go itshetsa ngwaga wa ntlha wa sekolo"" which means you need to provide proof of sufficient funds for a student visa.
"
"Ke mang, thata, yo a ka nnang a tlhoka Visa e e atolositsweng?","The correct answer is **C: Moithuti wa boditšhabatšhaba** (International student).

The passage explicitly states that studying in a foreign country usually requires a longer stay than tourism and, therefore, international students often need a visa that allows for an extended period of stay.
"
"O tshwanetse o tlhokomele menang neng, segolobogolo?","The best answer is **A: Ka dikgwedi tsa selemo**.

The passage explicitly states ""Ka selemo, segolobogolo, o tla tshwanela go tlhokomela menang..."" (In summer, especially, you will have to take care of mosquitoes...). While the other options are related, the *most* specific and direct answer pulled from the text is summer.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se o sa tshwanelang go se dira go tila menang fa o kgweetsa go ralala sekgwa sa pula?","The correct answer is **A: Go tlogela dikgoro tsa sejanaga di butswe sebaka**

The text states that even opening car doors for a few seconds is enough for mosquitoes to enter the vehicle. Therefore, you shouldn't leave the car doors open for long to avoid mosquitoes.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke dife tsa dipolelo tseno ka Sundarbans tse e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **B: Bontlhabongwe jwa yone bo apesitswe ke mafelo a loraga**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""mo e ka nnang *nngwe-tharong* ya yone e apesitswe ke mafelo a a metsi/loraga"" (approximately one-third of it is covered in wetlands/mudflats). ""Bontlhabongwe"" means half, which is incorrect based on the text.
*   The other options are all true based on the information given in the passage.
"
Ke karolo efe ya sekgwa e letseng mo nageng ya India?,"The correct answer is **A: Phaka ya bosetšhaba ya Sundarbans**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Lefelo la sekgwa se le le mo nageng ya India lebitswa Sundarbans National Park."" (The part of this forest that is in India is called Sundarbans National Park.)
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mang yo go ka fitlhelwang a na le , bonnye, go tlhaloganya mo go lekanyeditsweng, ga puo ya sejatlhapi go gaisa bangwe?","The correct answer is **B: Batho ba dingwaga tse di kwa tlase (People of younger age)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dichaba ka bontsi di bua puo ya sekgowa sentle thata, mme e bile go fitlhelwa thata go tlhoka kitso go ko tlase thata - bogolo jang thata mo bananeng."" (Most nations speak English well, and a lack of knowledge is found to be very low - especially among young people). This directly indicates that younger people (bananeng) are more likely to have a better understanding of English (puo ya sekgowa).
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se go ka nnang thata go se bitsa?","The correct answer is **B: Diaterese**.

The passage states: ""Go ntse jalo segolobogolo fa go tla mo diatereseng ka ga ntsi go le bokete go a bua sentle."" This directly translates to ""This is especially true when it comes to addresses as it is often difficult to pronounce them clearly."" Therefore, addresses are presented as being difficult to pronounce.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke seemo sefe se se ka siamelang mosepedi yo o ikaelelang go tshwara bese go tswa kwa seteišeneng sa dibese tse di tsamaelang ko dikgaolong di sele?","A ke karabo e e siameng.

Ka jalo, karabo e e siameng ke A."
Ke eng seo e ka nnang keletso e e siameng go mojanala yo a batlang go ya botlhaba go tswa seteišeneng sa dibese tse di tsamaelang kwa dikgaolong di sele?,"The correct answer is **B: Reka thekete malatsinyana pele o tsaya loeto**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Ka gore dibese tse di tsamaelang ko dikgaolong di sele di nna di tletse, go botoka o reka thekethe ya bese malatsinyana pele o tsaya loeto."" (Because buses traveling to other districts are often full, it is better to buy a bus ticket a few days before traveling.)

The other options are incorrect based on the passage:

*   **A: Dibese fela, di tloga morago ga 8:30:** The passage says most buses, especially those going west, leave between 6:30 and 7:30. It doesn't explicitly say buses *only* leave *after* 8:30, and it doesn't specify a schedule for eastern destinations.
*   **C: Dibese tse dintsi di tloga motshegare otlhe:** The passage says buses leave throughout the day, but the *majority* (bontsi) leave in the morning.
*   **D: Thekisi e e kopanelwang e ka nna mokgwa o botlhale wa go tsamaya:** The passage mentions shared taxis as a good option for *short* distances, specifically Paro and Punakha. Traveling east could be a long journey, so this is not necessarily a wise suggestion."
"Ke efe ya e latelang e e seng tlhaloso ka nepagalo, ya Timbuktu?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **C: Ga o kgone go e fitlhelela ka sefofane**.

Setlhogong se se fa godimo, go boletswe gore Timbuktu e na le boemafofane. Ka jalo, kgang ya gore ga o kgone go e fitlhelela ka sefofane ga se nnete.

Polelo e e fa godimo e bolela ka tlhamalalo gore Timbuktu e na le boemafofane, ka jalo e a fitlhelelwa ka sefofane. Gape, e bolela ka tlhamalalo gore ""Toropo e farologane thata le ditoropo tse dingwe tsotlhe tsa naga"".
"
Diolimpiki tsa selemo di ne di rulaganyeditswe neng mo tshimologong? ,"The correct answer is **D: Phukwi 2020**.

The passage states ""...bontsi jwa melawana ya phimolo e e amanang le Coronavirus ga e akaretse kgwedi ya Phukwi ka 2020, nako e e eng rulaganyeditswe metshameko ya di-Olympic.""
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke neng mo diphatlhanyana tse di fologang go tswa mo marung a setsuatsue, di nnang kgwanyape?","The correct answer is **D: Morago ga go kgoma mmu**.

The passage states: ""Di simolola pele e le diphatlhanyana tse di fologang go tswa mo marung a setsuatsue, mme di bo di nna """"kgwanyape"""" fa di kgoma mmu.""  This directly says that the funnel clouds become tornadoes *after* touching the ground.
"
"Ke sefe sa tseno, se e leng sebopego ka nepagalo, sa kgwanyape?","The correct answer is **C: Di nna pele le diphatlhanyana tse di fologang go tswa mo marung a setsuatsue, di bo di kgoma mmu**.

This answer best describes the formation and evolution of a tornado, as stated in the passage.

The other options are true of tornadoes but don't fully describe their defining characteristics:

*   **A & B:** These describe the *effects* of a tornado, not its fundamental form.
*   **D:** This describes the *mechanism* that causes a tornado but it is incomplete. The passage says it draws the air inward, not outward.

"
"Go ya ka temana,mojanala o tshwanetse a bone kgakololo go tswa kae tebang le seemo sa dipolotiki kwa toropong e a batlang go e etela?","The correct answer is **D: Go tswa kwa pusong ya bone**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that government advisories are targeted towards their own citizens. It mentions the example of Americans potentially receiving different advice than Europeans or Arabs. Therefore, a traveler should seek advice from their own government.
*   The passage also describes the advisories as often ""broad, non-penetrating, and weak,"" especially compared to more in-depth information from elsewhere. This indicates that advisories from your home country will be helpful in receiving more information.
*   The passage mentions that government advisories and their aids are targeted toward their citizens.

The other options are incorrect:

*   A: The passage doesn't suggest getting advice from the government of the destination country. This is implied to be inaccurate since it would target their own citizens and not you.
*   B: The passage suggests that travel advisories are insufficient and only provide shallow knowledge.
*   C: The passage specifies that government guidance is geared towards their own citizens, not travelers."
"Fa go na le dikitsiso tsa mosepele,ke eng se se ka nneng sa se diragalele motswantle?","The passage explicitly states that travel insurance and health insurance used on travels can be affected by travel advisories. It also says the advisories offer a superficial overview of the political situation.

Therefore, the correct answers are:

*   **A: Inshorense ya go emisa loeto e a amega** (Travel cancellation insurance is affected)
*   **B: Tshoboko e e sa tsenelelang tebang le maemo a dipolotiki a lefatshe** (A superficial summary of the political situation in the country)
*   **C: Inshorense ya botsogo e a amega** (Health insurance is affected)"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mofuta ofe wa leeto o o ka tswang o ka se tlhoke thuso ka peeletso go tswa kwa moemeding wa tsa mesepele?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **A: Leeto la go ya phuthegong ya badiri mo toropong e mojanala a kileng a e etela peleng.**

"Go ya ka temana, ke mo seemong sefe mo mojanala a ka solegelwang molemo ke thuso ya moemedi wa tsa mesepele?","The best answer is **B: Fa mojanala a na le kgatlhego go peeletso ya leeto le le kgethegileng lekgetlho la ntlha**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that agents often give advice that goes beyond a traveler's previous experience, especially concerning nature, culture, language, or lower-income countries. This implies assistance is most valuable when the traveler is venturing into something new or specialized.
*   The passage also suggests that using an agent who frequently makes similar travel bookings can be beneficial. This implies specialized knowledge is valuable.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Fa mojanala a beeletsa leeto la mafelo a le mantsi, a bo a bowa gape, go ya go etela toropo ya gaabo:** While an agent *could* help, the passage doesn't specifically highlight repeat travel to the same town as a primary benefit of using an agent. An agent might be useful for complicated itineraries, but returning to the same place doesn't necessarily make it *more* beneficial to use an agent.
*   **C: Fa moeti a kgona go bua sentle, puo ya kwa a etelang teng:** If a traveler already speaks the language, they need less help from an agent regarding cultural or linguistic barriers.
*   **D: Fa mojanala a etela lefelo le pharologano ya ditso e leng setlwaedi go bone:** If a traveler is accustomed to cultural differences, they would need less help from an agent with cultural understanding.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se se ka thusang mojanala go tila go swabisiwa fa a etela mafelo a maša?","The correct answer is **B: Go ikaelela go leka go ja dijo tse o tla bong o sa di tlwaela**.

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes that things will be different when you travel. It mentions differences in customs, laws, food, traffic, lodging, conditions, language, etc. Therefore, it is important to be open minded and try new things.
*   A is incorrect, the passage says not to expect things to be the same.
*   C is incorrect, it says that laws will be different
*   D is incorrect, doing research is useful and is not mentioned as something to be avoided in the passage.
Therefore, the best answer is B.
"
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso mo temaneng, ke mofuta ofe wa motho o a ka swabang fa a etela lefelo le lengwe?","The correct answer is **C: Mongwe yo o sa fetoleng mogopolo (Someone who is inflexible/doesn't change their mind)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage says you should expect things to be different when you travel.
*   It also warns that people who don't keep this in mind risk being disappointed or even disliking the local way of doing things.
*   Therefore, someone who is inflexible and unwilling to adapt to new ways of life would be the most likely to be disappointed."
Ke sefe sa tse di latelang se o ka se eletseng mojanala yo o etelang naga e e tlhabologang la ntlha ka sone?,"The passage explicitly advises considering staying in high-end hotels in developing countries when first arriving. Therefore, the best answer is:

**D: Sekaseka go tšhwina mo dioteleng tsa mafatshe a a tlhabologileng, tsa maemo a a kwa godimo**
"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e sa umakiwang e le sengwe se o ka se ntshetsang madi a a bonalang fa o itlwaetsa naga e nngwe?,"The correct answer is **A: Dijo tsa mekgwa ya kwa dinageng tsa Bophirima**.

Here's why:

*   **B: Ditirelo tsa boleng:** The passage explicitly mentions ""ditirelo"" tsa maemo a a kwa godimo (high-quality services) as something to spend money on to adjust.
*   **C: Materase le mosamo tsa go kampa:** The passage mentions the importance of having camping gear like ""bolawana"" (sleeping bags) or nets when camping to avoid creatures. It also advises against sleeping on the ground.
*   **D: Diotele tsa mafatshe a a tlhabologileng:** The passage directly advises staying in ""dioteleng tsa mafatshe a a tlhabologileng tsa maemo a a kwa godimo"" (high-end hotels in developed countries) to ease into the new culture.
*   **A: Dijo tsa mekgwa ya kwa dinageng tsa Bophirima:** While the passage does mention ""dijo"" (food) and does recommend easing into a new place, it does not suggest that you need to spend more money on Western-style food, so this one is not mentioned.

Therefore, Western-style food is not mentioned as a means of acclimatization, so it is the correct answer."

"
"Go ya ka temana,ke selekanyo sefe sa negative e e bontshang mofuta wa filimi o o tlwaetseng go dirisiwa?","The correct answer is **D: Negative ya 36 ka 24 mm**

The passage states: ""Filimi tsa go tlwaelegatsa tsa 35 mm (ya negative ya 36 ka 24mm) ke tsone tse di itseweng thata."" (Standard 35 mm films (with a negative of 36 by 24mm) are the most well-known). This directly answers the question.
"
"Ke efe ya mefuta e e latelang, e e farologaneng ya difilimi, e e neelanang ka resolushene e e sa tlhomamang fa e bapiswa le khamera ya gajaana ya dijithale , ya lense e le nngwe?","The passage states that 35mm film has a resolution that is ""inferior when compared to a modern digital single-lens camera.""  The question asks which type of film has an *inferior* resolution.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Filimi ya dimilimitara di le 35**
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e tla nnang ya bofelo ya go simolola kgwebo ya go kwala ka mosepele?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **C: Itirele webosaete e e leng ya gago**.

2.  Ipaakanye le go tlhabolola mo inthaneteng
3.  Itirele webosaete ya gago

Ka jalo, go itirela webosaete ke ntlha ya bofelo.
"
"Fa o simolola kgwebo ya go kwala ka mesepele, ke bofe ba bokgoni jo bo latelang, bo o ka bo tokafatsang pele?","The correct answer is **C: Ipaakanyetsa**.

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""...Tsela e e motlhofo thata ya go simolola kgwebo ya go kwala ka mesepele ke go tokafatsa bokgoni jwa ga go mo webosaeteng e e tlhomilweng ya maeto."" This translates to ""...The easiest way to start a travel writing business is to improve your skills by writing for an established travel website.""
* **P continues:** ""Morago ga gore o nne le bokgoni jwa go ipaakanyetsa le go tlhabolola mo inthaneteng, moragonyana, oka kgona go itirela webosaete e e leng ya gago.""  This means ""After you have the skills to **prepare** and develop online, later, you can create your own website.""

The passage specifically mentions ""ipaakanyetsa"" (prepare/planning) as a skill to develop *before* creating your own website.
"
Mathata a mala a bonwa ka tlwaelo mo maemong afe a bosa?,"The correct answer is **C: Maemo a bosa a a bolelo**

The passage states: ""Fela jaaka malwetsi a mafatlha mo mafelong a a tsididi, malwetsi a mala a tlwaelesegile mo mafelong a a molelo..."" which directly translates to: ""Just like lung diseases in cold places, intestinal diseases are common in hot places...""
"
"Go ya ka temana, ka go bo o rakana le megare ya ko o tswang,masole a mmele wa gago a ka tswa a tiile kgatlhanong le eng?","The correct answer is **B: Megare ya selegae**.

The passage states ""...ka go bo o rakana le megare ya ko o go tswang, masole a mmele wa ga go a ka tswa a tiile mo e ka go tsenyeng bolwetsi."" This directly translates to ""Because you encounter germs from where you come from, your body's defenses are likely strong against them."" Therefore, your body is likely strong against the germs of your home, i.e., local germs.
"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e nang le molemo wa go tsamaya mo teng ga kgaolo ya Schengen?,"The correct answer is **A, B, and C.**

The passage explicitly mentions:

*   Avoiding multiple visa applications (""ga o tlhoke go nna o tsenya kopo ya setlankana mo di nageng tse e leng maloko a Shengen"")
*   Saving money (""se se boloka nako, madi le tiro e ntsi ya dipampiri"")
*   Avoiding passport control checkpoints (""o ka kgona go tshela melelwane kwa ntle ga go feta mo mafelong a tshireletso a go tlhola dipaseporoto gape"")

Option D is incorrect because you *do* need a Schengen visa (or to be a citizen of a Schengen country) to travel within the area. The passage states that with a Schengen visa, you avoid applying for visas for *each* country."
Ke eng seo se sa tlholeng se bonwa kwa lebitleng Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **D: Dikhumo (Treasures)**.

The passage explicitly states, ""Dikhumo tse di magasigasi tsa lebitla ga di tlhole di le teng mo go lone, mme di ntsheditswe kwa Motlobong wa Ditso wa Egepeto, kwa Cairo"" which translates to ""The magnificent treasures of the tomb are no longer there, but have been moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.""
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke kae kwa Vancouver koo go ka se ngokeng bajanala ba ba se nang madi a le mantsi? ","The passage states that Whistler is ""expensive"". Therefore, the answer is:

**D: Whistler**
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke lefelo lefe, le le ka neelang bajanala, maitemogelo a mmatota a Vancouver?","The correct answer is **A: Setlhaketlhake sa Bowen**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes Bowen Island as a popular day trip or weekend getaway for kayaking, hiking, shopping, and dining. This suggests an authentic and readily accessible Vancouver experience.
*   Whistler is mentioned, but it's noted as expensive and more focused on winter sports and mountain biking in the summer.
*   Granville Island is mentioned as the location where the public transportation to Bowen Island comes from.
*   The passage doesn't say anything about what Vancouver provides tourists."
"Go ya ka temana, bajanala ba tshwanetse ba etele neng Diphororo fa ba batla go bona ba sa kgoreletsege?","The correct answer is **D: Fa e se setlha sa dipula**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that during the rainy season (Ngwanatsele go fitlha Mopitlwe), water levels are high, making it difficult to see the falls properly because of the spray.

*   Therefore, it is better to visit when it's *not* the rainy season if you want a clear view of the falls without getting soaked.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke molemo wa eng o o bonwang ka go etela Diphororo tsa Victoria magareng ga Ngwanatsele le Mopitlwe?","Based on the passage, none of the options are a benefit of visiting Victoria Falls between November and March. The passage states the opposite:

*   **A: Ditebo tse di sa kgorelediweng tsa Diphororo (Unobstructed views of the Falls):** The passage explicitly says it's *difficult* to see the bottom of the falls due to the volume of water.
*   **B: Bajanala ba palo e e kwa tlase (Lower tourist numbers):** The passage does not mention tourist numbers.
*   **C: Go leba go ntse go diragala tse dingwe tse di ngokelang (The views of other attractions):** The passage says that Victoria Falls have the most attraction.
*   **D: Go tila setlha sa dipula (Avoiding the rainy season):** November to March *is* the rainy season.

Therefore, the correct answer is that none of the options are benefits. The rainy season is actually a disadvantage, according to the passage, because of the obstructed views."
"Go ya ka temana, ke sefe sa tse di latelang se se sa kgothaletsweng fa o dirisa drone go gatisa filimi?","The correct answer is **D: Go gatisa filimi mo go tletseng batho moo drone e ka se lemogweng**.

The passage specifically states that flying a drone over large groups of people is a bad idea. The other options (A, B, and C) are all related to researching regulations and permissions, which the passage encourages.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke kae mo go siametseng go gatisa filimi ka tiriso ya drone?","Ntlha ya boammaaruri go ya ka temana ke **D: Mo mafelong a o kileng wa bona ditlankana tsa tetlelelo gone**.

"Go ya ka temana,ke polelo efe tebang le ditlhokego fa o ikwadisetsa setlankana sa go etela naga e nngwe e seng nnete?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **B: Dinaga tsotlhe di tlhoka ikwadiso kwa balaoding ba selegae**.

Temana e supa gore ikwadiso ke tlhokego mo dinageng dingwe fela, eseng mo dinageng tsotlhe. Dikgetho tse dingwe ke tsa boammaaruri go ya ka temana.
"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e seng lefelo le mojanala a ka yang go dira ikwadiso?,"The correct answer is **C: Kantoro ya selegae ya poso**.

The passage mentions the following places for registration:

*   Local police station
*   Hotel
*   Department of Immigration

The passage does not mention a post office as a place to register."
Ke mang a ka se ungwelweng ka go ithaopa o le maetong?,"The passage states that volunteering abroad is a good way to save money because many volunteer jobs provide accommodation and some even offer a small allowance.  It also says it's a good way to learn new skills, meet new people, and learn about different cultures.

Therefore, someone who **wants a significant salary** (B: Mongwe yo o batlang tuelo e e utlwalang) would *not* benefit from volunteering abroad.

So the answer is **B**.
"
"Go ya ka temana,go ithaopa o le kwa moseja, go ungwela jang mojanala yo o se nang madi a mantsi?","The correct answer is **C: Go neelanwa ka lefelo la bonno le boroko ka dinako dingwe**.

The text states: ""...go somarela madi, go nna kwa lefelong le le lengwe lobaka lo le leele ka go nne ditiro tsa baithaopi ka bontsi di fa boroko e bile tse dingwe di kgona go duela dikatsonyana."" This directly supports option C.

While the passage mentions benefits like gaining new perspectives (option D), it doesn't directly address how it helps a traveler with limited funds *specifically* other than through accommodation and potential small stipends. Options A and B are inaccurate according to the text.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se se ka tsewang e le leeto le le tlwaelesegileng la go ya Walt Disney World?","The correct answer is **C: Go nna leeto lotlhe ntle le go tswa kwa dikagong tsa Disney**.

The passage describes a ""typical"" trip to Walt Disney World as involving flying into Orlando, taking a Disney bus to a Disney hotel, and **spending a week without leaving Disney property** before returning home. Option C captures this core element of staying within the Disney ""bubble"" for the entire trip.

While D is correct, it is only one specific detail of the whole trip. C describes the most important part of the trip.
"
Ke dife tsa dipolelo tseno ka Walt Disney World tse e seng nnete?,"The correct answer is **A: Dithekete tse di ka diriswang gantsi di a amogangwa le bajanala**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Dithekete tse dintsi di rekisitswe ka diwebosaete tsa palabalo jaaka eBay kgotsa Craiglist ke tse di ka diriswang gantsi, mme di setse di simolotse go dirisiwa. Le fa seno se tlwaelesegile thata, se kgathanong le molao wa Disney: dithekete ga di amoganwe."" which means re-used tickets are *not* transferable, making option A false.

The other options are true according to the passage:

*   B: The passage mentions staying at a Disney hotel.
*   C: The passage mentions buses that take people from the Orlando airport to Disney hotels.
*   D: The passage explicitly states that re-used tickets can be found on resale websites.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya dintlha tse di latelang, e e ka nneng ya se nne gone mo dithutong tsa ikatiso ka fa tshwanelong kgotsa dibuka le dimakasine?","The correct answer is **C: Go itshiamisetsa lefelo la ntwa.**

Here's why:

*   **The text states that books and magazines about wilderness survival are plentiful, while those about war zones are scarce.** This means that information on self-defense in a war zone or warzone preperation is less likely to be found in books and magazines.

The other options are mentioned explicitly or implied as part of proper training courses:

*   **A: Go iphemela mo sekgweng (Wilderness self-defense):** While training courses will mention this, the text indicates that it is more likely to be found in books and magazines, and not less likely.
*   **B: Go ipaakanyetsa thusopotlako (First aid preparedness):** The text specifically mentions ""kitso e e tseneletseng ka dithuso tsa ntlha"" (in-depth knowledge of first aid) as part of the training.
*   **D: Diketšhe (Tactics/strategies):** The text mentions ""dikeche"" (tactics) as being included in training.

Therefore, the element least likely to be found in self-defense courses or books/magazines is war zone preperation since the text points out the scarcity of information about it."
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya dithuto tse di latelang, e e ka nneng ya rutwa thata mo ikatiso ka fa tshwanelong?","The passage states: ""Thuto, gantsi e akaretsa dintlha tsotlhe tse di umakilweng fa, ka botlalo, ebile gantsi go akarediwa le maitemogelo a namana. Ithutuntsho ya mohuta o ka gale e go ga malatsi a le 2 go ya go a 5, mme e akaretsa dikeche, kitso e e tseneletseng ka dithuso tsa ntlha mme fa gongwe go na le go re o ka rutwa go dirisa dibetsa.""

This indicates that first aid (dithuso tsa ntlha) is taught in detail in these courses. While other topics might be covered, first aid is specifically mentioned as a key component.  The passage also explicitly contrasts the abundance of resources on wilderness survival with the scarcity of resources on war zones.

Therefore, the best answer is:

**A: Dithuso tsa potlako**
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke tlhopho efe e e di gaisang,e o ka tilang metsi a a ka tswang a tlhoka go phephafadiwa ka yone?","The best answer is **B: Reka metsi a lebotlolo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...fa o na le tlhobaelo, o tla tshwanelwa ke go reka metsi a gago mo lebotloleng le le tswalegileng sentle gotswa kwa khampaning e e tshepagalang."" This directly suggests bottled water as the safest option when you're concerned about water quality.

Let's look at why the other options are less ideal:

* **A: Bedisa metsi metsotso e le mmalwa:** The passage mentions that the necessary boiling time depends on the specific threats present. It's not a guaranteed solution for all situations.
* **C: Bedisa metsi motsotso o le mongwe:** The passage says this is only sufficient in *some* places, implying it's not a universally safe method.
* **D: Tlhatlhoba metsi gore a ga a na matshosetsi a a kgethegileng:** While understanding the threats is helpful, it doesn't guarantee the water is safe to drink immediately. Testing requires resources and knowledge that may not be readily available, and may not be accurate. The text also implies that bottled water is the best option 'fa o na le tlhobaelo'.

Therefore, buying bottled water is the most effective way to avoid potentially contaminated water as per the passage.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se se ka batlang se sa kgonagale le fa o le mothumi yo o nang le bokgoni?","The correct answer is **C: Go thuma ba itepatepanya le makhubu**.

The passage states: ""Batho ba le bantsi ba latlhegelwa ke botshelo ba sena go tlhaela ba leka go thuma ba itepatepanya le makhubu go mo go le ga ntsi go sa kgonegeng."" This directly translates to ""Many people lose their lives after failing while trying to swim against the currents which is mostly impossible.""
"
O tshwanetse go dira eng fa o le mo metsing a a elelang ka lebelo?,"The correct answer is **A: Leka go tswa mo makhubung ka go leba letlhakoreng le lengwe, o bo o thuma jaaka gale, o boela kwa lotshitshing.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Fela fa o sena go tswa mo metsing a a elelang ka lebelo, go thuma o boela ko o go tswang ke mo nka o thuma jaaka gale."" This directly supports option A.  The passage emphasizes getting *out* of the rip current (metsi a a elelang ka lebelo) before attempting to swim back to shore.  Swimming sideways is the way to do this.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Thumela ka bonako kgatlhanong le makhubu:** The passage warns against this. It states that people often drown trying to swim against the current because it's usually impossible.
    * **C: Thuma o lebile tsela e e farologaneng:** While swimming a different direction is key to escaping the current, option A is more precise as it clarifies one must swim sideways.
    * **D: Thumela kwa boteng:** The passage does not say to swim to boteng.

Therefore, option A is the best and most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke lefelo lefe le go etela ntlo ya bogosi, e le leeto la tlosobodutu, go ka ntswelang molemo?","The correct answer is **C: Mo mokgatšheng wa Rhine.**

The passage states: ""Sekai ke go etela dikago tsa bogosi ko Loire Valley, le ko Rhine Valley..."". This directly connects visiting royal buildings with the Rhine Valley.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke sefe sa tse di latelang se o ka se eletseng basadi ba ba tsamayang mo lefelong le, go se dira?","The best answer is **C: Se rwale palamonwana e e lebegang e le tlhwatlhwa e e kwa godimo thata**.

Here's why:

*   The passage *explicitly* advises women to wear a ring that doesn't appear too expensive.
The passage gives advice about avoiding harassment, but it doesn't say to misrepresent your marital status so option A is incorrect.

The passage tells women to be aware of cultural differences, but not that it *motivates* behaviors that could be perceived as harassment, so option B is incorrect.

The passage does not reference using physical force if needed, but does suggest to be firm when rejecting men, so option D is incorrect.
"
"Go ya ka lefelo le le tlhalositsweng mo temaneng,o ka eletsa bajanala ba basadi jang?","The correct answer is **D: Tlhomama fa o gana banna, mme o ikemele, fa ba go kopa lerato** (Be firm when refusing men, and stand up for yourself if they make advances).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly advises women to be firm in their refusals and to stand up for themselves, regardless of cultural differences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lemoga gore ga go a tlwaelega go salwa morago (Recognize that it is not normal to be followed):** The passage directly states that being followed is common in this region, and it would be misleading to imply this practice is considered acceptable.
*   **B: Rwala palamonwana e kgolo go supa gore o nyetswe (Wear a large ring to show that you are married):** The passage states the opposite: to wear a wedding ring, but not one that looks too expensive.
*   **C: Tlhaloganya gore pharologano ya ditso e tsitsinya gore o tile go ikemela (Understand that cultural differences suggest you should avoid standing up for yourself):** The passage advises women to stand up for themselves despite cultural differences."
"Go ya ka temana,ke seemo sefe se se ka tlhokang gore motsayaditshwantsho wa diphologolo a dirise lense ya taolabogolo, e telele?","The correct answer is **C: Fa diphologolo tse di tshwantshiwang di na le ditlhong**.

The text says ""Go tsaya ditshwantsho tsa diphologolo tsa naga go tlhoka lense ya taolabogolo e telele;"" which implies a telephoto lens is required for animals in the wild. Therefore, shy animals would benefit from being photographed from a distance, hence the need for a telephoto lens.
"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e sa umakiwang e ka nna kgwetlho go batsayaditshwantsho ba diphologolo?","The correct answer is **C: Go bona mofuta wa lense o o tlhokegang**.

The passage mentions needing different lenses for different types of wildlife photography (long telephoto lenses for large animals, different lenses for flocks of birds or small creatures). However, it does *not* present this as a *challenge*. It simply states it as a requirement. The other options are explicitly mentioned as challenges:

*   **A: Go bona diphologolo tse dingwe tse di sa tlwaelegang** (Finding rare animals) - ""Go thata go bona diphologolo tse dintsi tse di sa tlwaelegang""
*   **B: Diphologolo tse di tlhaga di na le dikgoka** (Wild animals being aggressive) - ""Diphologolo tse di tlhaga di ka tswa di le...dikgoka""
*   **D: Go dira mo seemong se se tletseng letlhoo** (Working in hostile conditions) - ""Seemo se ka nna tsididi, mogote kgotsa go seng jalo, se se tletseng letlhoo."""
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e ka bakang mathata a a seng mantsi go mokgweetsi yo a tsamayang go ralala dithaba?","The correct answer is **A: Bokete jwa dikoloi**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""...bokete jwa dikoloi mo tseleng bo tsamaya fela bo sa fetoge ngwaga otlhe"". This implies that the weight of the vehicle itself is **not** a major contributing factor to the problems a driver might face in icy/snowy mountain conditions.

The other options are directly mentioned in the passage as potential hazards:

*   **B: Ga a kgone go itsetsepela** (Loss of traction on ice/snow)
*   **C: Go wa ga marothodi ka bontsi** (Impaired visibility due to snow, rain, or frost)
*   **D: Go bona mo go kgoreletsegileng** (Impaired visibility due to snow, rain, or frost)

Therefore, the only option that the passage suggests is *not* a significant problem is the weight of the vehicles on the road."
Ke eng se se ka nnang sa se fetoge ka lekgetho la letseno go ralala dinaga tse di farologaneng?,"The best answer is **C: Koo o kwadisang teng**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""tax brackets"" and ""the way income tax is structured"" can vary greatly across countries. The main thing that wouldn't change is *where* you have to register/file your taxes - the country you are working in."
"Go ya ka temana , fa o dira kwa moseja, mme o nna golo gongwe, ke kae moo o ka nneng wa kwadisa lekgetho la letseno teng?","The correct answer is **C: mo nageng e o dirang go yone gajaana**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that working abroad often means you'll have to register for income tax in **the country you are working in** (the ""overseas"" country).
*   It also mentions needing to register tax in your **home country**, but that is a separate consideration.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gongwe le gongwe ko o nnang teng ka gale:** This is too vague.
*   **B: Mo Dinageng tse di Kopaneng:** The United States is given as an example, but the passage is speaking generally about working abroad.
*   **D: Gongwe le gongwe koo dituelo di leng kwa tlase teng:** The passage does not mention or imply that you should file taxes wherever rates are lowest."
"Ke efe ya dipolelo tse di latelang, e e sa tlhaloseng ka nepagalo, Dipontsho tsa Lefatshe?","Karabo e e nepagetseng ke **B: Dipontsho tsa temo di diriwa gammogo le ditshupetso tsa botaki le dithuto.**

Lebaka:

*   P temogo e tlhalosa gore Dipontsho tsa Lefatshe di na le ditshupetso tsa botaki le dithuto mo dipavilione tsa naga.
*   E tlhalosa gape gore Dipontsho tsa Bodichabachaba tsa Temo ke ditiragalo tse di kgethegileng.

Se, se kaya gore ke ditiragalo tse pedi tse di farologanyeng, mme ga di dirwe ka nako e le nngwe. A, C le D ke dintlha tse di nepagetseng tse di tlhalositsweng mo ditemaneng."
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e leng molawana wa Dipontsho tsa Lefatshe kgotsa Dipontsho tsa Bodichabachaba ?","The correct answer is **A: Ditshupetso di tshwanetse go supa ka fa dilo di dirwang ka teng mo nageng gammogo le dikgwetlho tsa lefatshe.**

This is directly stated in the passage: ""Dinaga di dira ditshupetso tsa botaki le dithuto mo pavilion ya naga, go supa dikgwetlho tsa lefatshe, le ka fa dilo di dirwang ka teng mo ditsong tsa one.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ga go naga e le nngwe e e ka tshwarang meletlo ngwaga le ngwaga** - While the passage indicates events are in different countries each year, it's stated specifically for the International Agriculture Exhibitions, not necessarily World Expos as a whole.
*   **C: Ditiragalo di tshwanetse go tsaya dikgwedi di le thataro** - The passage says the events ""gantsi e tsaya lobaka lwa dikgwedi tse tharo go fitlha go tse thataro (usually last three to six months),"" meaning six months is the maximum, not a requirement.
*   **D: Gore go tshwarwe dipontsho, dinaga tsotlhe di tshwanetse go tsaya karolo** - The passage does not state that all countries must participate. It simply states that countries create exhibitions."
"Go dira dife tsa tse di latelang, go ka batla go fokotsa kgonagalo ya tlhaselo ka diphologolo?","The best answer is **B: Go tlosa matlakala mo kampeng** (Removing trash from the campsite).

Here's why:

*   **The passage emphasizes that smells attract bears and other wildlife, making it clear that keeping a clean campsite, free of food odors and trash, is crucial for preventing encounters and potential attacks.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go tshola dijtlhatshana tse di nang le monkgo** (Keeping smelly snacks) - The passage explicitly advises *against* having smelly foods.
*   **C: Go tshola sekgala sa dijarata di le 25 go tswa kwa diphiring** (Keeping a distance of 25 yards from wolves) - The passage says the distance is 100m or yards
*   **D: Ba seka ba di fa dijo** (Don't feed them) - The passage says to avoid feeding animals, but that has a smaller effect on drawing animals closer, in comparison to the smell
"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e sa umakiwang mo temaneng jaaka se se ka bakang ditlhaselo ka diphologolo tsa naga","The correct answer is **D: Diphologolo tse di sa tlwaelang batho**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Menkgo e e bogale** - The passage explicitly states ""ela tlhoko go re menkgo e ngoka dibera le diphologolo tse dingwe tsa naga, ka jalo tila go tshola kgotsa go apaya dijo tse di nang le menkgo mme o boloke kampa e le phepa.""

*   **B: Go retelelwa ke go emela kgakala le tsone** - The passage emphasizes the importance of keeping a safe distance from animals and mentions that many visitors get injured because they get too close.

*   **C: Go fepa diphologolo tsa naga** - The passage starts by saying that people shouldn't feed wild animals.

*   **D: Diphologolo tse di sa tlwaelang batho** - While the passage does mention that wild animals are not accustomed to people, it doesn't list this as a *cause* of attacks. The passage focuses on other factors.

Therefore, option D is not explicitly mentioned as a reason for attacks in the provided text."
