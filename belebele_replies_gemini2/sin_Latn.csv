"mema chedayata anuwa, nivaeradiva Ekodiyan wadanaya kirima sandaha niwaeredi igiyak lesa saelakillata gaeneemata nohaekke kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: vaedipura shabdayak labaa gaeneema sandaha, yaturu matha yodana balaya vaedi karanna**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that *vaedipura shabdayak labaa gaeneema sandaha piyanovak wadanaya karad dee men yaturu mata vaedipura balayak yedimata awashya novana bava mathaka thabaa ganna.* This translates to: ""Remember that you do not need to apply more force to the keys, as you would when playing a piano, to obtain more sound.""
*   Options B, C, and D are all supported by advice within the passage about playing with minimal effort, keeping hands relaxed, and using dynamics effectively."
"Ekodiyan wadanaya karana wita, shabdaya vaedi kirimata upakaaree wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","Based on the passage P, the answer is **A: vaedi wegaya (increased speed)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that you **don't** need to apply more force to the keys to get a louder sound.
*   It specifically says that on an accordion, to get more volume, you use more pressure or speed on the bellows (""vaedi pidanayakin ho wegayakin mainahama bhavitha karayi"").

Therefore, increased speed (vaedi wegaya) is the method described for increasing the sound when playing the accordion."
rupavahiniye pinthura wala paethi maim kappadu kerenne aeyi?,"The correct answer is **B: pinthuraya thiraya sampurnayen pireema sandaha** (to fill the screen completely with the picture).

The passage states: ""Boho rupavahini thana aeththe saamanya janathava sathutu karana aakarayata ya. Enisaa, rupavahiniya thula oba dakina siyalle ihala, pahala saha paethi maim kappadu kara atha. Mese kara aeththe rupa sampurna tiraya aawaranaya karanu pinisaya.""

This translates to: ""Many television sets are designed to satisfy the general public. Therefore, what you see on television has the top, bottom, and side edges cropped. This is done to cover the entire screen.""
"
mema chedayata anuwa DVD aakruthiyata chit‍rapatayak pariwarthanaya kirime dee muhuna deemata ida aethi gaetaluwa pahatha sandahan gaetaluwalin kumak wiya haekida?,"The passage describes a problem called ""overscan"" where TVs cut off the edges of the picture (top, bottom, and sides) to make the image fill the entire screen.  It also mentions that subtitles close to the bottom edge of the screen can be completely cut off.

Therefore, the problem faced when converting a movie to DVD format described in the passage is:

**B: ardha washayen kapaa daemunu upasiraesi (partially cut off subtitles)**
"
ehi b‍rithan‍ya hamuda balakotuvak pihita thibune koheda?,"The correct answer is **C: bordantavun**.

The passage states: ""General John Cadwalder...avahira karanu pinisa bordantavunhi brithanya hamuda balakotuvata erehiva haeravum praharayak diyath karanu atha."" This translates to ""General John Cadwalder...will launch a diversionary attack against the British garrison at Bordentown in order to distract them.""
"
athin liyana lada ketumpathe dis wu athsana kaageda?,"The correct answer is **D: Chaales Thompsan**.

The text states that ""congrasaye sabapathi John Haenkok saha **lekam Chaals Thompsan visin athsan thabaana lada ketumpatak**"" which translates to ""a document signed by Congress President John Hancock and **Secretary Charles Thomson**"". So Charles Thomson signed the document.
"
"pahatha sandahan sthaana atharin, dunlap brodside ekak awasan warata paeminiye kothaenada?","The correct answer is **C: landan**.

The passage states: ""agosthu 10 wanada ek pitapatak landanaya wetha laebini"" (On August 10, a copy reached London). This is the last specific location mentioned where a copy of the Dunlap Broadside was sent.
"
kerrnal starkge bhatayin sthanagathakara thibune koheda?,"The correct answer is **A: uthuru kelavare, mayima dige**.

The passage states: ""Starkge minisun yatath janapadavaesiyange sthanaye uthuru kelavare mayima dige sthanagatha viya."" This directly translates to ""Stark's men were positioned on the northern shore along the Mystic River.""
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, starkge minisun owunge vaeta digu kale kawadada?","The correct answer is **B: nith‍ya bhatayin kanuwa pasu kala pasuwa (after the regulars passed the ditch)**.

The passage states: ""Girdley ho Stark vaetata adi 100 (meetara 30) k pamana idiriyen ritak thaebu athara nitya bhatayan eya pasu kara yana tek kisidu kenek vedi nothaebiya yuthu bavata niyoga kale ya.""  This translates to ""Girdley or Stark ordered that no one should fire until the regulars passed the ditch about 100 feet (30 meters) ahead of the fence.""  Therefore, they wouldn't fire (and thus not be engaging in their defensive position along the fence) until after the regulars passed the ditch.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, chinaye wadathma p‍rachandakaaree yugayan walin ekak wuye pahatha sandahan kumana yugayada?","The passage states that the period between the Han and Jin dynasties, known as the ""Three Kingdoms"" (translated from ""rajadhani tune vakavanuvayi""), was a bloody and violent era in ancient China. It describes it as ""purathana chinaye vaediyenma le thaevarunu yugayak"" which translates to ""the most bloody era in ancient China"". Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: thun-rajadhaani yugaya** (Three Kingdoms Period)
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, hamuda kuhumbu kandayamak sancharaka awadhiyakata aethulu vime sath‍yaya kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: owunta adu aahara saepayimak aetha** (They have less food available).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Pawathina aahara adu wo vita kolaniya sancharaka avadhiyak aarambha karayi."" This translates to ""When the existing food supply is low, the colony begins a traveling period.""
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, sancharaka awadhiyedee hamuda kuhumbu kandayamwala koodu saedeeme purudu niwaerediwa pilibimbu karanne kumana p‍rakaashayada?","The passage states: ""Mema avadhiye dee, kolaniya sadanne dainikawa venas kerena thavakalika koodu ya."" This translates to ""During this period, the colony builds temporary nests that are changed daily.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: owun dainikawa koodu wenas karai (they change nests daily)**.
"
bahira ingi aethi witadeeth pahatha sandahan dae athurin digatama pawathinu aeththe kumakda?,"Based on the passage (P), the most appropriate answer is:

**C: jiva vidyatmaka oralosu** (Biological clock)

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""Jaiva oralosu svayan poshitha dholaka wana athara bahira ingi rahithava vuvada nidahasva dhawanaya wana chackrayak thula akhandava pawathinu aetha."" This means biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that can function independently even without external cues, and they continue to run cyclically.

The other options are less accurate:

*   **A: antharaasarga chackra** (Internal cycle): While related to biological rhythms, this is a more general term and doesn't specifically refer to the entity that continues to run even without external cues.
*   **B: aavartita ridmayan** (Repeated rhythms): This is the *result* of the biological clock's function, not the mechanism itself.
*   **D: nireekshanaya karana lada ridmayan** (Observed rhythms): These are rhythms that are observed in organisms, but the question is asking about what continues without external cues. So the term observed rhythms is more about what we perceive than what powers the continued cyclic behaviour."
kisiyam lakshanayaka vichal‍yathavayan penwana pudgalayan wisthara karana wachanaya kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: bahurupee**.

The passage states that individuals showing variations in certain characteristics are considered ""bahurupee"".
"
kisiyam p‍radeshayaka vasaya karana jivin sandaha niwaeredi yeduma pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: janagahanaya (population)**.

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""Gahanayak yanu, yam nishchita bhugoliya pradeshayak thula sitina, yam nishchita visesayaka jivin kotasakage ekathuvayi."" This translates to: ""A population is a collection of a specific group of living beings that live within a specific geographical area.""

* **Q asks:** ""kisiyam p‍radeshayaka vasaya karana jivin sandaha niwaeredi yeduma pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?"" This translates to: ""Which of the following is the correct term for living beings inhabiting a particular area?""

The definition provided in P directly defines a population. Therefore, the answer is B. The other options are not as directly related to inhabiting a particular area:

*   **A: Ekarupee (Uniform):** It is related to the similarity of individuals within a population, but it doesn't define the inhabiting group itself.
*   **C: Jivin Visesha (Species):** Species is a broader classification, not necessarily tied to a specific area.
*   **D: Bahurupee (Polymorphic):** Polymorphism refers to variations within a population, not the population itself.

sobadhahama matha padanamkaragath sanchaaraka kriyaakaarakamakata udaharanayak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"Let's break down the problem. The passage (P) describes nature-based tourism activities focused on experiencing beautiful landscapes and interacting with the natural environment, including wildlife. It mentions examples like visiting parks, observing birds, and studying the ecosystem with the help of local guides.

The question (Q) asks which activity, from the options provided, would *not* be an example of this nature-based tourism.

Now let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Diya aellak wetha yaamata kandu naegeema (Climbing mountains to go to a waterfall):** This aligns with nature-based tourism as it involves experiencing natural landscapes and potentially observing wildlife.

*   **B: Wanamal jaayaarupakaranaya (Photographing forest flowers):** This is a clear example of nature-based tourism, focusing on capturing the beauty of the natural environment.

*   **C: Widyaa kavuthukaagarayak naerabima (Visiting a science museum):** This is NOT nature-based tourism. A science museum is an indoor, man-made institution, often dealing with scientific concepts rather than direct interaction with nature.

*   **D: Krumeen lesa wana dae haraha masun aelleema (Fishing through the forest with lures):** This does involve some nature, it's an example of interacting with nature, specifically fishing.

Therefore, the activity that is NOT an example of nature-based tourism is visiting a science museum.

**Answer: C**"
"mema chedayata anuwa, p‍ravaahana paddhathiye padanama wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: pudgalika motor ratha** (private motor vehicles).

The passage explicitly states: ""pudhgalika motor ratha matha padanam woo praavahana kramayak sandaha sahaya denu laebe"" which translates to ""supporting a transport system based on private motor vehicles."" This makes it clear that private motor vehicles are the foundation of the transport system discussed.
"
n‍yashtiya wata kakshagatha wana anshu walata kumana aakaaraye aaropanayak thibeda?,"The passage states: ""electronavalata aeththe rina viduli aaropanayaki.""

Electrons are the particles orbiting the nucleus.  Therefore, the answer is:

**C: rina aaropanayak** (negative charge)
"
n‍yashtiya samanwitha wanne kumana anshu walin da?,"The correct answer is **A: Protona saha newtrona** (Protons and neutrons).

The passage states: ""Nyashtiya- newtrona ha protona lesa ansu dekakin samanvitha we"" which translates to ""The nucleus is composed of two types of particles - neutrons and protons"".
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, ilakkam pahaka dvimaya sankyaankayakata udaharanayak wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The passage explains that a binary number (dvimaya sankhya) consists only of 0s and 1s (0 and 1 wana athara).

We need to find which of the given options represents a binary number:

*   **A: 1010** - Contains only 0s and 1s.
*   **B: 12001** - Contains the digit 2, which is not allowed in binary.
*   **C: 10010** - Contains only 0s and 1s.
*   **D: 110101** - Contains only 0s and 1s.

The question asks for an *example* of a binary number representing the *number five*.  The question does not say which base to convert the number five from.  Typically in these types of questions, the numbers are converted from base 10.  The base 10 number 5 is equivalent to the base 2 (binary) number 101.  However, none of the options is 101.

The best answer is A. This can be confirmed by converting each option into a base 10 number.

A: 1010 = (1 * 2^3) + (0 * 2^2) + (1 * 2^1) + (0 * 2^0) = 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 10
B: 12001 is not binary.
C: 10010 = (1 * 2^4) + (0 * 2^3) + (0 * 2^2) + (1 * 2^1) + (0 * 2^0) = 16 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 18
D: 110101 = (1 * 2^5) + (1 * 2^4) + (0 * 2^3) + (1 * 2^2) + (0 * 2^1) + (1 * 2^0) = 32 + 16 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 53

The question is misleading because it does not specify the base that the number five should be converted from.  Based on the information given, A, C, and D are all valid binary numbers, but do not represent the value five. The most likely answer is **A: 1010** because it is a binary number. However, the correct interpretation is that the question has no correct answer because none of the options represents the value 5 when interpreted as a binary number.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{A}$"
dvimaya sankyaanka handunwanu labanne pahatha ewayin kumak lesada?,"Based on the passage provided, the correct answer is:

**A: bits**

The passage states: ""Dvimaya sankhyaavakata thibiya haekke agayan dekakin ekak pamanak, enam 0 how 1 wana athara, mema sankhyaa dvimaya sankhyaanka lesa handunvayi - nathahoth pariganaka wanmaalawa thula bit lesa haedinve.""

This translates to: ""A binary number can have one of two values, either 0 or 1, these numbers are known as binary numbers - or **bits** within computer software.""

Therefore, a binary number is also known as a bit in computer contexts.

pahatha sandahan karunu atharin blogkarana sisunta aethi mulika p‍rathilabhayak lesa chedaye sandahan nowana karuna kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: sama wayase mithurangen vivechna adu vima**.

Here's why:

*   **A: vyakarana ha livime kusalatha vaedi diyunu kirima (Improvement of grammar and writing skills):** The passage directly states that students initially start blogs with poor grammar and spelling, but audience feedback motivates them to improve.

*   **C: avata lokaya pilibanda awabodhaya pulul kirima (Broadening the understanding of the external world):** The passage states, ""blog kireemen """"sisunta thama avata lokaya pilibandava buddhimat weemata balakarayi"""""" (blogging encourages students to be more aware of their external world).

*   **D: thawaduratath igeneemata aethi aashawa vaedi kirima (Increasing the desire to learn further):** The passage says, ""Blogkaranaya yanu sahayogitavayata anubala dene mevalamak wana athara sampradhaaika pasal dinakata vada hondin igenima pulul kirimata sisun dirimath karayi"" (Blogging is supportive of collaboration and encourages students to broaden their learning better than a traditional school day).

*   **B: sama wayase mithurangen vivechna adu vima (Reduced criticism from peers):** The passage focuses on the fact that being able to handle criticism is an essential skill. There is nothing that indicates that blogging will reduce criticism from peers. It is, in fact, the opposite."
pahatha daekwena blogkarana angayangen kumana angaya sisunge liweeme kusalatha vaedi diyunu kirimata pelambavimak lesa sandahankara thibeda?,"Let's analyze the provided text and the answer options:

*   The question asks which aspect of blogging is mentioned as a motivator for **improving students' writing skills.**

*   **Option A: antharjalaye aethi drawya walata kriyaasheeleewa p‍rathichaara daekvima (Actively responding to online material):** The text states, ""antharjaala drawya valata kriyaashiliva prathichaara daekweema tulin sisunta an ayage lekhanavala sandarbhaya thula ovunge sthavaraya nirvacanaya kala haeki athara visheshitha karana sambandhayen ovunge idiridarshana genahaera daekviya haekiya (oravek, 2002)."" This means that responding to online content helps students define their stance in relation to others' writing and express their perspectives on specific issues. This directly relates to improved writing skills and critical thinking.

*   **Option B: vivechna walakwa gaeneemata aethi aashawa (Desire to avoid criticism):** The text mentions that students ""uthsaha karayi"" to improve their writing to avoid criticism, but this isn't presented as a positive motivator for skill development. It's more about avoiding negativity.

*   **Option C: p‍rekshakayange unanduwa pawathvagena yaama (Maintaining audience interest):** The text notes that students are motivated to be skilled and engaging to meet the audience's needs, but this is about audience engagement rather than explicitly developing better writing skills.

*   **Option D: sahayogeethawaye awashyathawaya (The need for collaboration):** The text mentions that blogging supports collaboration, but it does not directly correlate to improving students' writing skills.

**Conclusion:**

Option A is the most accurate answer, as actively responding to online material directly contributes to students developing their own voice, critical thinking, and perspectives, which are all essential for improved writing skills.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A**.
"
sisun sandaha aesinkronas sannivedanaye p‍rathilabhayak nowanne pahatha sandahan karunuwalin monavada? ,"The passage describes the benefits of asynchronous communication for students. Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: Mulashrayak lesa antharjalaya bhawitha kirima (Using the internet as a source):** The passage states that the internet allows students to access information at all times, which supports asynchronous learning. This *is* a benefit.

*   **B: Dawase onaema welawaka upadeshakayin wetha muhunata muhuna p‍raweshaya (Face-to-face access to instructors at any time of day):** The passage *explicitly contrasts* asynchronous communication with face-to-face meetings, noting students can ask questions any time of day, which implies asynchronous communication offers alternatives to face to face access.. Therefore, this is something that asynchronous communication *doesn't* provide.

*   **C: Nam‍yashili vaeda karana welawan (Flexible working hours):** The passage mentions ""namyasili wada kaala sambandha shackyathava"" (flexible work schedules) as a benefit, so this *is* a benefit.

*   **D: Wega palanaya (Pace control):** The passage states that students gain the ability to ""palanya kireeme haekiyaawa"" (control) the pace of their learning with asynchronous communication, so this *is* a benefit.

Therefore, the only option that is *not* a benefit of asynchronous communication is **B: Dawase onaema welawaka upadeshakayin wetha muhunata muhuna p‍raweshaya (Face-to-face access to instructors at any time of day)**. Face-to-face is synchronous communication.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, aesinkronas sannivedanaye pahatha sandahan angawalin sisunta nam‍yashii nowana anga kumakda?","Let's break down the passage and the question to find the best answer.

*   **The Passage's Core Idea:** The passage describes the advantages of asynchronous communication in education. It highlights flexibility and accessibility for students. Key benefits include:

    *   **Student Pace:** Allows students to work at their own pace.
    *   **Information Access:** Provides 24/7 access to information via the internet.
    *   **Instructor Interaction:** Enables students to ask instructors questions at any time and receive timely responses.
    *   **Flexible Scheduling:** Reduces time constraints due to the flexible work schedule.

*   **The Question:** The question asks, based on the passage, which aspect of asynchronous communication is *NOT* flexible for students. In other words, which of the options does asynchronous communication *not* provide flexibility?

*   **Analyzing the Options:**

    *   **A: Igeneeme wegaya (Learning pace):** The passage explicitly states that asynchronous communication allows students to work at their own pace (""thamage ma wegayen wada kireeme haekiyaawa aetikarayi""), making this flexible.
    *   **B: Waeda karana welawan (Working hours):** The passage mentions ""namyasili wada kaala sambandha shackyathava"" (flexible work schedule), indicating that this is a flexible aspect. It further states it reduces time constraints.
    *   **C: Upadeshathmaka drawya (Instructional materials):** The passage mentions students have information access via internet 24/7, which means they can access instructional materials on their own terms. This is flexible.
    *   **D: Antharjala bhawithaya (Internet usage):** The passage does not mention any constraints to internet usage. Internet access is presented as constant.

Since none of the options represent a rigid aspect of asynchronous communication based on the provided information, this question is flawed. But considering the other options, **the best answer among the choices provided would be D**. The other options are explicitly mentioned as flexible, but the passage presents internet access as a constant - not necessarily an element that the students can control.

**Therefore, the best answer is D.**"
madhya kaaleena maliga samaga sambandha kala haeki deyak lesa chedaye sandahan nowanne kumakda?,"The passage discusses several aspects related to medieval castles:

*   **Ashva pora (Horse battles):** Mentions the idea of horse battles being a key aspect.
*   **Bhojana sangraha (Food storage):** Discusses food storage.
*   **Athariyaanu veerathvaya pilibanda rupa (Aspects of chivalrous heroism):** Heroism/chivalry is mentioned.
*   **Sangrama wala shabdaya saha gandhaya (The sounds and smells of battles):** Battle sounds are mentioned.
*   **Biya aghraanaya (Smell of fear):** Fear is mentioned.

However, the word 'jost' is never mentioned in the passage. Therefore the answer is B.
"
maligawe natabun lesa mava daekwiya haeki suwandak ho shabdayak lesa chedaye sandahan nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The passage describes the atmosphere of a medieval stable in a royal palace, focusing on the sounds, smells, and feelings associated with it. It mentions sounds of hooves striking stone (kura), the smell of stables, and the implied fear (biya) associated with long-ago battles.  It also references food storage (bhojana sangraha).

The question asks which of the provided options *isn't* explicitly mentioned as a sound or smell associated with the ruins of the palace. The passage mentions kura (sound of hooves), biya (fearful atmosphere/feeling).  It implies a connection to food storage in the stable, perhaps through odors.  While battles are mentioned as a point of reflection/memories triggered by the setting, a specific 'sound' or 'smell' of ""satan"" (meaning battle in this context) is not described.

Therefore, the answer is **A: satan**.
"
karbi makselo maligaya pilibanda niwaeredi wistharayak wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: idikarana kaalawakavanuwe rate paewathi samakaamee swabhawaya hethuwen awama balakotu gananak awashya wiya**.

Here's why:

*   **P** (Passage): ""1480 ganan valadi, haesting saamivaraya visin ehi idikireem aarambha karana vita rata saapekshava saamakami woo athara arakshava awashya uuye ibagathe saerisarana kudaa kollakaruvanta erehiva pamani.""
    *   Translation: ""In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings began building it, the country was relatively peaceful, and protection was only needed against occasional minor raids.""

*   This passage directly states that the country was relatively peaceful *during the time of construction*. Because of this peaceful state, the need for fortifications was minimal, only to guard against small raids. This matches option **B**.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: maligaye ghana biththi illa sitiye haesting samivarayaa wisini** (The castle lacked strong walls, which were provided by Lord Hastings) - This contradicts the passage, which implies the castle was not built with long-term defence in mind. It's not that Lord Hastings *provided* the walls; rather, the walls themselves were not that sturdy.

*   **C: maligave idikireem adala kaalawakavanuwa sandaha saaman‍ya deyak noviya** (Building of the castle was not normal for that time period) - The passage doesn't imply building the castle was unusual.

*   **D: eya sthaapithakara aeththe digukaaleena ha sthira p‍raharayanta erehi vima sandaha ya** (It was built to withstand long-term and constant attacks) - This directly contradicts the passage, which indicates the castle was *not* built to withstand long-term or constant attacks."
mema chedaye wisthara kara aethi seemawa thula pahatha sandahan idikirim lakshana walin karbi makselo maligave asaaman‍ya lesa salakanu labanne kumakda?,"Based on the passage, the following points are relevant:

*   The palace was built when the country was relatively peaceful.
*   The need for defense was only against small-scale raids.
*   The palace had large open doors and windows and thin walls, which wouldn't withstand strong attacks for long.

Therefore, the answer is **D: thuni biththi** (thin walls). The passage highlights that the thin walls of the palace are unusual because they wouldn't be able to withstand a strong attack. Option A is irrelevant because the passage indicates they had large, open doors. Option B goes against the passage as it states it would not withstand a strong attack, and option C doesn't have specific information on reduced fortifications compared to other palaces."
"mema chedayata anuwa, elabena irthuva sandaha sudanam wana duwannekuta wadath p‍rayojanawath wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The passage states that ""Sisira irthuve dee gama harahaa diweema saha shareeraye ihala kotasa sandaha kridaagaara vyaayaam kireema dhawana kaalaya sandaha wana hondama sudanama wei."" (Running across villages in winter and gym exercises for the upper body are the best preparation for the running season.)

Therefore, the most beneficial preparation for a runner getting ready for the upcoming season, according to the passage, is both:

*   Running across villages in winter.
*   Using the gymnasium to exercise the upper body.

Option A reflects the first part of this best preparation.
Option D reflects the second part of this best preparation.

However, since we need to pick only one, and the passage explicitly mentions both as the **best** preparation, we need to choose the one that encompasses BOTH aspects. Since the question asks what is *wadath p‍rayojanawath* (most useful), we need to infer which one is slightly *more* beneficial. Both seem equally important, but training the upper body is something that's useful for all sports, but *running across villages in winter* is SPECIFICALLY mentioned as the BEST preparation for running during that season. Thus, it is the *most* useful option.

**Therefore, the correct answer is A: sisira irthuve dee gama haraha diweema puhunu vima (Practicing running across villages in winter).**

"mema chedayata anuwa, palamu panthiye saethapum bhaga duwannekuta wadathma vaedgath wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: wegayata wada vindadaragaeneeme shakthiya wardhanaya kirima**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...vegayata laebenne adu vaedagathkamak wana athara, daereeme shakthiya athyavasya awashyathaavak bavata pathway"" - This directly translates to ""While obtaining speed is of less importance, endurance strength becomes an essential requirement.""
* **The passage emphasizes:**  ""...siyaluma vyasanayanhi dee vindadaragaeneema purudu puhunu viya yuthu ya"" - This means ""...one must be trained to endure in all hardships.""
* **Options A, C, and D** focus on cold-weather training, achieving fast times, or speed over endurance.  The passage explicitly de-emphasizes speed and elevates the importance of endurance.

Therefore, the most important thing for a first-class rescue part runner, according to the passage, is improving endurance strength over speed.

"malala kridakayeku sandaha, poshana kriyaa piliweth thulin pamanak labaa gatha nohaekke pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","Based on the passage, the answer is **C: wishishta karya saadhanaya**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Sudusu poshana kriya piliweth valin pamanak itha usas karya saadhanayak jananaya kala nohaeki..."" which translates to ""Excellent performance cannot be generated from nutrition alone..."" ""usassa karya saadhanayak"" refers to 'excellent performance'.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, tharuna malala kridakayinta kridaven vaedi thrupthiyak labaa gaeneemata nirdesha nokaranne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The passage states that maintaining a healthy energy balance, developing effective hydration habits, and choosing different types of snacks can help young athletes improve their performance and increase their satisfaction in sports.

We're looking for something that *isn't* recommended for young athletes to increase their satisfaction in sports.

*   **A: nisi poshana piliweth pilipaedeema (Following proper nutrition protocols):** The passage talks about choosing different types of snacks, implying the importance of nutrition.

*   **B: wishishta mattamin saema witama krida kirima (Always playing at an excellent level):** The passage doesn't talk about always playing at an excellent level; it focuses on things like nutrition and hydration that *help* them perform better and enjoy it more. Playing at an excellent level is not directly linked to satisfaction in the passage.

*   **C: phaladayi lesa sajalanaya kirima (Hydrating effectively):** The passage directly mentions ""phaladayi sajalana purudu aethi karagaenima"" (developing effective hydration habits).

*   **D: soukyamath shakthi thulayak pavatvagaenima (Maintaining a healthy energy balance):** The passage directly mentions ""soukyamath shakti tulanayak pavatvagaenima"" (maintaining a healthy energy balance).

Therefore, the answer is **B**.

"mema chedayata anuwa, maeda dura duwanneku wada mila adhika upakaranayak mila dee gaeneemata hethuwa kumak wiya haekida?","The correct answer is **A: eya owunge pawudgalika kaemaettaki (eya owunge pawudgalika kaemaettaki)** which translates to ""It's their personal preference.""

Here's why:

* The passage states that even if a product doesn't give a real return or benefit, young athletes can still hide their liking for it (their preference).  This implies personal preference can drive a purchase, even if logic suggests otherwise.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: ehi oppu kala p‍rathilabha aetha (ehi oppu kala p‍rathilabha aetha)** - This translates to ""It has proven benefits."" The passage explicitly says some products *don't* provide real benefits.
* **C: eya owunge karya saadhanayata behewin balapanu aetha (eya owunge karya saadhanayata behewin balapanu aetha)** - This translates to ""It greatly affects their performance."" The passage says some equipment can have little actual impact on performance.
* **D: adu milaethi upakarana pilibandawa vaeradi sankalpa aetha (adu milaethi upakarana pilibandawa vaeradi sankalpa aetha)** - This translates to ""There are misconceptions about cheaper equipment."" While the passage mentions misconceptions, it doesn't directly link that to *why* someone would buy more expensive equipment. The passage focuses on the draw of equipment even when it's not demonstrably better.

Therefore, personal preference (A) is the best explanation given the context of the passage.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, maedi dura dhaawanayata awashya wanne kumakda?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: boho upakarana (many equipment/accessories)**.

The passage states that although Maeda long-distance running is a cheap sport in terms of duration, there are many different ideas about the necessary equipment for its participants.
"
n‍yashtika chumbhaka anunadaya soyaagaththe kawuda? ,"The correct answer is **C: bloch saha parsel**.

The passage states: ""MRI yanu 1930 gananvala dee philix bloch (stanfod vishwa vidyalaye sevaye niyuthu) saha edward parsel (harvad vishwa vidyalaye) visin soyagat, nyasthika chumbaka anunada (NMR) yana bhautika vidyaatmaka sansiddhiya matha padanam vuvaki.""

This translates to: ""MRI in the 1930s was discovered by Felix Bloch (serving at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (Harvard University), opening the path to the physical phenomenon of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).""
"
waidya rupakarana anunadaya sandaha palamu petant balapath‍raya labaa dunne kumana warshayeda? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

The text states: ""Vasara hatarakata pasu petant balapatrayak labunu athara..."" which translates to ""Four years later a patent was obtained..."". Since the text says Raymond Damadian discovered the application for medical diagnosis in 1970, the patent was obtained in 1970 + 4 = 1974.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, an ayage bhautika kriyaawan artha nirupanaya kirima sandaha minisunta daedi awabodhayak thibiya yuththe kumak pilibandawa da?","The correct answer is **B: Abhip‍raya (Intent)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage focuses on predicting and understanding the *reasons* behind people's actions.** The example about the car window highlights this: breaking a window is typically interpreted as attempted theft (one intent), but if the person is trying to enter their own car without keys, the interpretation (and therefore the intent) is different.
*   **Other options explained:**
    *   **A: Aashawa (Hopes/Desires):** While desires can influence intent, the passage is directly concerned with understanding the specific motivation behind an action.
    *   **C: Visvasaya (Beliefs):** Beliefs can shape intent, but the core issue is understanding *why* someone is doing something, not necessarily what they believe.
    *   **D: Awabodhaya (Understanding):** Understanding is necessary, but the passage emphasizes understanding someone's *purpose* or *goal* when performing an action."
"mema chedayata anuwa, abhip‍raya therum gaeneema minisunta kumak kirimata upakaaree weda?","The correct answer is **A: bhautika kriyaawan pitupasa aethi awinishchitha bawa iwath kirima** (removing the uncertainty behind physical actions).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that understanding intentions (abhipraya therum gaeneema) helps us resolve the ambiguities of physical actions (bhautika kriyaawange aethi viya haeki degidiyaavan visanda gaenimata ida dei). The example of breaking a car window illustrates this perfectly: the action itself is ambiguous until you understand the person's intention. If the intention is theft, the action is understood as criminal. If the intention is to enter their own car without keys, the action is viewed differently. This directly aligns with removing the uncertainty behind physical actions.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: aashawan purokathanaya kirima** (predicting desires): While related, the passage focuses more on understanding *current* intentions behind actions rather than predicting future desires.
*   **C: vinishchyakin thorawa an aya desa baeleema** (looking at others without judgment): While empathy and non-judgment are good qualities, the passage focuses on the practical benefit of understanding intentions for interpreting actions.
*   **D: an ayage manasa kiyavima** (reading other people's minds): Although ""mind reading"" is mentioned at the beginning of the passage, the explanation in the passage relates to interpreting someone's intention to clarify what someone is doing."
"mema chedayata anuwa, kruthima buddhiya hi p‍radhaana aramuna pilibanda niwaeredi saranshayak wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **D: karyayan svayankreeyawa kirima** (automating functions/tasks).

The text states that AI research is related to giving machines the ability to *automatically* perform essential tasks.  While planning, recognizing faces, and transcribing are mentioned as examples of AI capabilities, the main *purpose* (aramuna) according to the passage, is automation.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, kruthima buddhiya boho wita sambandha wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kumak samagada?","Let's break down the provided text (P) and find the answer in it:

*   The text describes Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a vital branch of computer science.
*   It mentions that AI is related to machine learning, reasoning, and intelligence processing.
*   It provides examples of AI's capabilities, including customer service, answering questions, and recognizing handwriting, faces, and patterns. It also specifically states ""saelasum kireema saha saelasum kireema"" which translates to *Planning and Schedule*.
*   It also states AI is used in various fields, such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military.

Considering the context, the most accurate answer is:

*   **B: saelasum kirima saha upalekhanagatha kirima** (*Planning and Scheduling*)

The passage explicitly mentions ""saelasum kireema"" as an example of AI capabilities. The other options are related to AI but are either too narrow (customer service, handwriting recognition) or are not as directly emphasized in the provided text(educational essays)."
"mema chedayata anuwa, abhisaree chinthana rataawan aethi ayekuge shakthiyak wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The passage states: ""Mema akaraye chintanayak sahitha minisunta thaarkika chintanayak pawathina athara **rataa mathaka thabaaa gaenimata, gaetalu visandimata saha vidyatmaka parikshana  kirimata haeki ya**.""

This clearly indicates that people with convergent thinking patterns have the ability to memorize facts, solve problems, and conduct scientific experiments.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: ratawan mathakaye thabaa gaeneema** (ability to memorize facts).
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, abhisaree manasikathwaye kendraya lesa nosaelakenne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","According to the passage, all the options are mentioned as being central to convergent thinking (Abhisaari Chintana) *except* one. Let's break it down:

*   **A: ek niwaeredi pilithurak pamanak aethi bawa therum gaeneema (Understanding that there is only one correct answer):** The passage explicitly states: ""aeththe ek nivaeradi pilithurak pamani."" (there is only one correct answer). Therefore, this *is* a central aspect.

*   **B: ohuta awashya kaalaya labaa gaeneema (Getting the time he needs):** The passage *doesn't* directly mention time as a *central* aspect of the *mindset* (manobhavaye). It focuses on speed (vegaya), logic (tharkaya), and accuracy (niravadyathaava). While time might be a factor in problem-solving generally, it's not a defining characteristic emphasized in the description of convergent thinking here.

*   **C: karunu handuna gaeneema (Identifying facts):** The passage mentions ""karunu handunaagaeneema"" as a key aspect (identifying facts).

*   **D: thorathuru raes kirima (Gathering information):** The passage mentions ""toraturu ek raes kirimayi"" (gathering information) as a key aspect.

Therefore, the answer is **B: ohuta awashya kaalaya labaa gaeneema (Getting the time he needs)**.

"mema chedayata anuwa, k‍shudra p‍rakaashanayak lesa nosaelakenne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The passage describes micro-expressions as subtle, involuntary facial movements that can reveal underlying emotions and potentially detect deception.  It doesn't define specific examples of micro-expressions.

Looking at the options:

*   **A: kathaa karana atharathura iwatha baeleema (Looking away while talking)** - This could be a sign of discomfort or deception, but isn't necessarily a micro-expression. It's a more conscious action.
*   **B: nalale raeli gaeseema (Wrinkling the forehead)** - This can be a micro-expression depending on the context.
*   **C: wegayen aesipiya gaeseema (Rapid blinking)** - This can be a micro-expression related to stress or deception.
*   **D: thambs ap ekak labaa deema (Giving a thumbs up)** - This is a deliberate gesture, not a subtle, involuntary facial movement.

Therefore, the action that is least likely to be considered a micro-expression is **D: thambs ap ekak labaa deema (Giving a thumbs up)**. It is a conscious, purposeful gesture, while micro-expressions are subtle, involuntary facial movements."
k‍shudra p‍rakaashanaya artha gaenvima pilibanda pahatha sandahan p‍rakaashawalin vaeradi wanne kumana p‍rakaashaya da?,"The passage states that:

*   Video recordings are helpful for understanding micro-expressions and facial movements.
*   Micro-expressions can help detect lies.
*   Even those with brain damage who can't understand speech can assess sincerity through micro-expressions.
*   Animals like dogs can interpret emotions, suggesting an innate ability to understand facial cues.

Now let's analyze the options:

*   **A: vidiyo patigata kireem saelakiya yuthu diyunuwakata hethu vi thibe (Video recordings have led to a significant improvement)** - This aligns with the general idea that video recording helps in analyzing micro-expressions and other non-verbal cues.

*   **B: niwaeredi artha nirupanaya wisin boruwa handunagatha haeka (Lies can be identified through correct interpretation)** - This directly reflects the statement that micro-expressions help detect lies.

*   **C: kathanaya menma muhune iriyawda artha gaenwe (Facial expressions are understood as well as speech)** - This ties into the concept of facial movements revealing meanings.

*   **D: eya awankabhawaya thakseru kirimata upakaaree we (It is helpful in assessing sincerity)** - This echoes the point about assessing sincerity even in individuals who can't understand speech, as well as referencing animals understanding non-verbal expressions.

**Therefore, all the statements A, B, C, and D are relevant to the passage and are discussed in the passage.** So none of them are distinct.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""punarudaya igenime praveshaya ha **daenuma vyaaptha kireemehi saelakiya yuthu venasak sidu kale ya**"" which translates to ""The Renaissance learning approach brought about a significant change in **knowledge dissemination**.""

While other options are mentioned, the passage *specifically* highlights the significant change in how knowledge was spread. Therefore, it's the most direct and emphasized effect of the Renaissance as described."
punarudye p‍rathiphalayak lesa adu awadhaanayak labaa dee aeththe pahatha ewayin kumak sandaha da?,"Based on the paragraph, the correct answer is **A: pudgalika mathakaya (personal memory)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""pudhgalika menehi kirimata aethi peedava nathi vuvat, paatah menehi kirimata aethi haekiyaawa sambandhava visesayen avadhaanaya yomu kerini."" This translates to ""Although the pressure on personal memory was lessened, special attention was directed to the ability to memorize lessons.""  This directly indicates that less attention was paid to personal memory as a result of the Renaissance approach to learning.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: daenuma labaa gaeneema (knowledge acquisition):** The passage indicates that the Renaissance *changed* how knowledge was acquired, not that less attention was given to it.
* **C: pela mathakaya (lesson memory):** The passage says *more* attention was given to lesson memory.
* **D: thorathuru beda haereema (information sharing):** This isn't directly addressed in the passage, though it could be argued that the spread of knowledge implies increased information sharing. However, the *direct* link to decreased attention is to personal memory.

*   The passage discusses how the internet can connect individuals and facilitate social interaction.
*   It mentions ""learning"" and ""socialization"" as motivations for using the internet.
*   It also refers to ""personal connection"" and ""integrated connectivity"" as key aspects observed in web user responses.

Now, let's analyze the options (Q) in relation to maintaining relationships:

*   **A: Vyaapara jalakaranaya (Business irrigation):** This relates to business processes and doesn't directly involve maintaining relationships.
*   **B: Pawule aya samaga sambandhatha pawathva gaeneema (Maintaining relationships with family members):** This *is* about maintaining relationships.
*   **C: Sanchaara pilibanda paryeshana kirima (Conducting travel-related research):** This is about travel, not directly about maintaining relationships.
*   **D: Nawa pudgalayin hamuvima (Meeting new people):** While it involves new connections, the core question is about maintaining *existing* relationships.

The question asks which option *doesn't* reflect the motivation of using the internet for maintaining relationships. Options B is most directly reflecting of the text.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: vyaapara jalakaranaya**

The text primarily discusses internet usage for learning, socialization, and personal connection. Business irrigation doesn't align with these motivations."

Here's why:

The passage discusses how the internet is used to connect people and provide access to services. It mentions learning (""igenima"") and social networking (""samaajaayanaya"") as examples.  The terms ""pudgalika sambandhaya (personal relationship)"" and ""akhanda sambandhataava (continuous connection)"" are highlighted as important aspects of internet usage.

Options A, B, and C all relate to potentially connecting with or learning from others in some way:

*   **A: wattoruwak sevima (searching for a job)** - This can involve networking and finding opportunities through online connections.
*   **B: margagatha sakachcha puwaruwaka pala kirima (posting on an online discussion forum)** - This directly involves social interaction and expressing personal opinions.
*   **C: sawukyaarak‍shaka nishpadana pilibanda paryeshana kirima (researching health-related products)** - This could involve seeking advice from others online or learning from shared experiences.

Option D, **mudal kalamanakaranaya kirima (managing finances)**, is primarily a personal and individual activity that does not necessarily involve building personal relationships or continuous connections with others in the way the passage describes. While online banking and financial tools exist, the core activity is often a solitary one focused on personal finances."

The passage states that Western Europe started to develop its own style ""Madyakalina yugaye avasan bhagayata vannata batahira yuropaya ovungema shailiyak vaedidiyunu karagaenimata patan gatteya."" which translates to ""Towards the end of the medieval era, Western Europe started to develop its own style.""

"mema chedayata anuwa, parisarika gaetalu sandaha shak‍ya digukaaleena visandumak lesa salakanu labanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","Based on the passage, the long-term solution to environmental problems is:

**C: gaetalu walata mul wana hethuwa handuna gaeneema** (Identifying the root cause of the problems)

This translates to ""However, if we do not need a temporary solution, we must find the root cause of the problems and stop them.""

Let's look at why the other options are not the best answer based on the text:

*   **A: p‍ramanaya ikmava yana sukhopabhogee jiwana rata thereem varjanaya kirima** (Avoiding wasteful, luxurious lifestyles) While the passage mentions that overpopulation and unsustainable lifestyles exacerbate the issues, directly addressing the root cause of the problem is more vital.
*   **B: kriyaakaareethwaya** (Activism) The passage mentions activism as a way to minimize short-term damages, not a solution.
*   **D: paarisarika vyaapaaraye sagayeku bawata pathvima** (Becoming an ally in environmental business) This may be beneficial but is not presented as a solution.

The long-term goal is to identify and deal with the origin of the environmental problem, not just react to the symptoms.

"mema chedayata anuwa, parisarika gaetalu sandaha roga lakshana p‍rathikaarayak lesa saelakillata ganu nolabanne pahatha sandahan visandumwalin kawareda?","Let's analyze the passage and the options.

The passage states that environmental issues are often treated like treating symptoms of a disease.  While symptom treatment is helpful in the short term, it's crucial to address the root cause of the problem.

The passage also suggests that human development and population growth are contributing to the problems.

The question asks which of the provided solutions would NOT be considered a ""symptomatic treatment"" according to the passage. In other words, which solution addresses the *root* cause.

*   **A: kriyaakaaree katayuthuwala niratha vima (Engaging in proactive actions)** - This is a general statement and could refer to both treating the symptoms or the root cause, depending on the specific actions. This is more likely to be considered a ""symptomatic"" response as the proactive actions can relate to managing or improving the problems but does not tackle the underlying cause.

*   **B: gaetaluwe mula hethuwa akriya kireema (Deactivating the root cause of the problem)** - This *directly* addresses the root cause, as highlighted in the passage.  This is NOT a symptomatic treatment.

*   **C: p‍ramanaya ikmawana sukhopabhogee jiwana rataa thereem pilibanda adhas p‍rakaasha kirima (Expressing intention to stop the excessive consumerist lifestyle)** - This relates directly to population growth and overconsumption, which are identified as underlying causes of the environmental issues. While expressing intention is not the same as doing, it directly addresses one of the fundamental causes. This could also be considered a ""symptomatic"" response.

*   **D: wadath parisara hithakaamee aakaarayakin jiwath vima (Living in a more environmentally friendly way)** - While positive, it is a broad solution. It might be a symptom-management but not exactly addressing the root cause.

Therefore, the answer is **B** because it is the only option that explicitly mentions deactivating or addressing the *root* cause of the environmental problems. This aligns with the passage's argument against only treating symptoms.

Here's why:

*   The passage directly discusses:
    *   The Catholic Church's immense power and wealth during a specific period in European history.
    *   The Christian belief that wealth should be used to alleviate poverty and suffering.
    *   The vast wealth accumulated by the Church and whether it aligns with its stated principles.
    *   The concentration of power in Rome.

*   The specific questions being raised are:
    *   Whether the Church's accumulation of wealth is justified given its teachings on poverty (relates to A and D)
    *   Whether the concentration of power and money is problematic (relates to C)

The passage *doesn't* explicitly suggest that the *fundamental teachings* themselves should be changed. The concern is whether the Church is living up to its own established principles."

b‍rithan‍yaye samp‍radayika nowana nawika yuddhaye p‍rathiphalayak nowuye pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"Let's break down the passage and the question to find the answer.

**Understanding the Passage (P):**

*   The passage talks about actions by Britain and Germany during a war (likely World War I).
*   Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany. This blockade violated international law and endangered neutral shipping.
*   Germany responded by expecting a similar response for its unrestricted submarine warfare.

**Understanding the Question (Q):**

*   The question asks: Which of the following was *NOT* a consequence of Britain's traditional naval warfare?

**Analyzing the Answer Choices:**

*   **A: samana yudha upak‍rama bhawitha kirimata wu germaniye kaemaeththa (Germany's willingness to use similar war tactics):**  This *is* a consequence. Germany expected (and then engaged in) unrestricted submarine warfare as a response to the British blockade. So this is wrong.
*   **B: me ha sambandha nowana naew anathurudayak thathwayaka thaebeema (Danger to ships not involved):** This *is* a consequence. The passage mentions that the British blockade endangered neutral shipping, so this is wrong.
*   **C: jaathyanthara neethiyata wenaskam sidu kirima (Changing/violation of international law):** This *is* a consequence. The passage directly states that the British blockade violated international law. So this is wrong.
*   **D: theeranathmaka saepaym p‍rawesha wiya nohaeki vima (Inability of conclusive safe passage):** This *is not a direct consequence of traditional naval warfare*. The blockade prevented safe passage, making it impossible.

**Conclusion:**

Option **D** is the correct answer.

germaniyata erehi b‍rithan‍ya nawika awahira niwaerediwa wisthara nokaranne kumana p‍rakaashayada?,"The question asks which statement *doesn't* accurately describe the British naval blockade against Germany. Let's analyze each option based on the provided text:

*   **A: eya jaath‍yanthara neethiyata patahaeni wiya (It violated international law)**: The text explicitly states that the blockade ""poduve piligat jaatyantara nithiya ullanghanaya kala"" (violated generally accepted international law). So, this IS a correct description.

*   **B: eya germaniye sabmaereen yuddhayata hethu wiya (It led to the German submarine warfare)**: The text mentions that Germany expected a similar response (unrestricted submarine warfare) due to the limited response to the blockade. This implies the blockade was a contributing factor. So, this IS a correct description.

*   **C: eya germaniye saepaym p‍ravahaya kadakappal kaleya (It disrupted the flow of German supplies)**: The text says ""athyavasya hamuda saha civil saepayum kapaa daemeeme mema upaaya margaya phaladayi bhava sanatha viya"" (This strategy proved effective in cutting off essential military and civilian supplies). So, this IS a correct description.

*   **D: apak‍shapathee naewwalata tharjanayak nowana bawa eya sahathika kaleya (It ensured it wasn't a threat to neutral shipping)**: The text says ""...brithaanyaya jaatyantara muhudu seemaawa bomba thabaana lada athara eya saamanya naevvalata da anaturudaayaka bhava aethi kaleya."" (...the British mined international waters, making it dangerous for even regular shipping). This contradicts the statement.

Therefore, option **D** is the statement that is NOT an accurate description of the British naval blockade.

* **Translation:** ""People who regularly engage in practices need more support to distinguish between negative sensations related to pain, chronic pain, and difficulties in general physical movement.""

This clearly indicates that the increased support is needed to help them differentiate and understand their negative awareness/sensations related to pain. The other options (thunatiya, manasika awapeedanaya, biya) are mentioned in the initial part of the passage as being related to pain, but the specific reason for needing *more support* is to understand the negative sensations associated with pain itself.

p‍ransha wiplawaya wisin aethikarana lada wenaskam athurin kamkaru panthiye puravaesiyan kerehi saelakiya yuthu balapaemak aethi kala wenasa kumakda?,"Based on the provided text, the answer is **B: panthiyata nowa nipunathawayata awadhaanaya yomu kirima** (Shifting focus from class to skill).

Here's why:

* **P directly states:** ""Hamudave shreni panthiya matha nova dakshataava matha padanam woo baevin eyama hamudava sambandhayen da sidu viya."" This translates to ""In the army, positions were based on skill, not class, and this was also implemented in other areas."" This shows a direct shift away from a class-based system to a merit-based system that benefits the working class by giving them opportunities based on their skills.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: rata wenuwen vaedi sahayogayak labaa gaeneema:** While increased cooperation may have been a *result* of the revolution, the text doesn't explicitly state this was the most significant impact *specifically* on the working class.
*   **C: ripablikan mathavadaya sammatha kirima:** While the revolution did establish a republic, the passage emphasizes the meritocratic aspect as a direct benefit for the working class.
*   **D: nawa minum paddhathiyak:** The text doesn't mention a new measurement system."
"p‍ransha wiplawayen pasuwa, hamuda saha wenath wurtheenhi saarthakathwaya aduwen padanam vimata ida aeththe kumak mathada?","The answer is **A: saadhanaya (achievement)**

Here's why:

*   **The text explicitly states:** ""...vadaatma apeksabharita saha sarthakatvayata kaemati pudgalayanta sarthaka weemata ida demin siyaluma pirimi ayaedumkaruvanta raekiya vivurta kerini."" This translates to ""...allowing individuals who are highly ambitious and desire success to succeed, opening up jobs to all male applicants."" This indicates a shift towards achievement-based advancement.

*   **The text also mentions:** ""...hamudave shreni panthiya matha nova dakshataava matha padanam woo baevin eyama hamudava sambandhayen da sidu viya."" This means ""...the army was also reformed, based on skills rather than class."" *Dakshataava* translates to skills or abilities, directly linked to achievement.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: panthiya (class):** The revolution aimed to *reduce* the importance of class, not increase it. The army reform is a direct example of this.
*   **C: abhilashaya (ambition):** While ambition is mentioned as a desirable trait, the question asks about the *basis* for success. Ambition is a motivator, but achievement is the result.
*   **D: wargaya (race/ethnicity):** The text doesn't discuss race or ethnicity at all in relation to professional success after the French Revolution.

Therefore, **achievement (saadhanaya)** is the most accurate answer because the text highlights the shift from class-based advancement to a system that values individual skills and accomplishments."

*   The passage (P) discusses issues related to transportation systems (p‍ravahana krama) and their efficiency. It questions why transportation systems don't always work as expected and if transportation engineers are addressing the problem adequately.
*   Question (Q) asks about public services that contribute to dissatisfaction in developed countries.
*   Option C, ""podu p‍ravahanaya"" (public transportation), is the most closely related to the themes discussed in the passage. Therefore, the answer is C.

**Final Answer: C**"
"mema chedayata anuwa, podu p‍ravahana paddhathi pilibandawa kumak kiwa haekida?","Let's break down the information and see which answer makes the most sense:

* **P (Original Text):** This text discusses a transportation system (pravaahana krama) and the challenges related to water quality, cost, and the possibility of inefficiency. It questions whether transportation engineers are managing it effectively or if other factors are at play.
* **Q (The Question):**  Based on the above passage, what can be said about the general transportation system?

Now let's analyze the answer choices:

* **A: ewa bhawitha karana saema kenekutama owun hondin aadaraya karai (Everyone who uses it loves it.)**  The passage implies problems and concerns, not universal love. This is unlikely.

* **B: ewa jalaye gunathmakabhawaya tharam naraka naetha (Its water quality is not so bad.)** The passage mentions concerns about water quality (jalaye gunaatmaka bhava), suggesting it *could* be an issue. This statement tries to downplay that possibility, which aligns with the text.

* **C: ewa bhawitha karana pudgalayingen boho paeminili aethi weyi (Many complaints arise from those who use it.)** The passage hints at inefficiency and potential problems, which could lead to complaints. This is possible, but not directly stated.

* **D: boho sanwardhitha ratawala ewa nomile laebe (It is available for free in many developed countries.)**  The passage mentions developed countries, but the main focus is water quality, cost, and efficiency of the transportation system. Availability is not a central theme.

**Conclusion:**

Option **B** is the most suitable answer. The passage mentions concerns about water quality related to the transport system. Saying that the water quality ""isn't so bad"" addresses a concern that is directly raised in the prompt.

Therefore, the answer is **B**.

Gamanaagamana pravaahaya vadaa hondata niyojana kirimata, pradhaana lakshana thunak athara sambandhatha sthapitha kara atha: (1) pravaahaya, (2) ghanatvaya, saha (3) pravegaya."" This translates to: ""...traffic flow has some common patterns and can be roughly represented mathematically. To better plan traffic flow, a relationship has been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.""

This clearly indicates that traffic density is used in mathematical representation of traffic flow. The other options are related to traffic in a general sense, but are not directly used in mathematical representation.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Harshe saha ches ovungema DNA, bacteriavakata baddha kirimata ropanaya ho **vairasa** bhavitha kalaha."" This translates to ""Hershey and Chase used a crop or **virus** to bind their DNA to a bacterium."" So, viruses (or a crop) were used to deliver the DNA.
"
wikurthi kirim walata daruwan wetha gena yaamata aethi haekiyaawa randa pawathinne kumak matha da?,"The correct answer is **A: sailaya wishabeeja walata mul we nam**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Janmaanu patha sailavalata karana vikurti vim pamanak daruvan wetha gene yanu labana..."" This directly translates to ""Only mutations done to germ cells (Janmaanu patha sailavalata) are passed on to children."" Germ cells are the reproductive cells (sperm and egg cells). Therefore, if the mutation originates in germ cells, it can be passed on to the offspring.

Let's analyze why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: jaanamaya drawyawala vaedgathkama (Importance of genetic material):** While the importance of genetic material is relevant in general, the passage focuses on the *type* of cell where the mutation occurs, not just the general importance of genetic material.

*   **C: wikurthi kirim wargaya (Type of mutation):** While the type of mutation could influence if it's viable to pass on, the passage explicitly states that only germ cell mutations are passed on, regardless of the specific mutation type.

*   **D: wikurthiya saila maranayata hethu wiya haeki nam (If the mutation can cause cell death):** The passage says mutations *outside* of germ cells could cause cell death/cancer. These mutations aren't passed on.

**Therefore, option A is the only one directly supported by the text.**"
"mema chedaye dakva aethi thorathuru matha padanamwa, wikurthi vimwala wiwidha balapaem randa nopawathinne kumak matha da?","The passage states that the effects of mutations vary depending on:

1.  The importance of the affected genetic material.
2.  Whether the mutation affects germ cells (cells that pass on genetic information to offspring) or somatic cells (other cells in the body).

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: jaanamaya drawya kopamana p‍ramanayak balapaemata lakwa aethda? (How much genetic material is affected?)** - While the amount of genetic material affected can play a role, the passage explicitly mentions the *importance* of the affected genetic material.
*   **B: balapaemata lak wu saila wishabeeja walata mul we nam (If it originates from affected germ cells)** - This is relevant because the passage distinguishes between mutations in germ cells and other cells.
*   **C: balapaemata lak wu jaanamaya drawyawala vaedgathkama (The importance of the affected genetic material)** - This is directly mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: balapaemata lak wu wikurthi wargaya (The type of mutation affected)** - While the type of mutation might influence the outcome, the passage focuses on the importance of the affected region and whether it's a germ cell mutation or not.

Options B and C are the most relevant. However, C more closely aligns with the directly stated factors in the passage. Also option B is less appropriate, as the question asks about the variety of effects, and option B simply asks about the case where the cells involved are germ cells.

Therefore, the best answer is **C: balapaemata lak wu jaanamaya drawyawala vaedgathkama (The importance of the affected genetic material)**.

*   **B: ewa idam thruna bhoomi bawata path kirimata udaw wiya (They helped to convert land into grassland):** While goats grazing *can* impact land, the passage doesn't mention this as a **reason** for initial domestication.
*   **C: ewa yam mith‍rathwayak labaa deyi (They provided friendship):** This is unlikely to be the primary reason for domestication. The passage focuses on practical resources.
*   **D: ewa kiri sandaha wu p‍raweshaya wiya (They provided access to milk):** This is a valid reason for domestication mentioned in the passage.

The question asks which of the options was **NOT** a reason.

*   Questioning and observation guide the scientific method.

Based on this, only relying *solely* on the scientific method wouldn't be helpful. The passage makes it clear that observation and intuition *also* contribute.

*   The passage states that ""ithaama prachanda wana siyayata dekak pamana wana tonado paya tunakata vada wadi welawak pawathee."" This translates to ""Tornadoes that are extremely violent, about 1 percent, last longer than three hours"". It is a minority of tornadoes that last over 3 hours.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: tonedo hata awata aethi saema deyakma winasha kirimata haekiyaawa aetha (tornadoes have the ability to destroy everything in their path)** - The passage explicitly states that tornadoes can destroy everything in their path.
*   **B: tonedo anekuth suli kunatu walata wada kuda p‍radeshawalata pahara deyi (tornadoes hit smaller areas than other cyclones)** - The passage mentions that tornadoes impact a small area.
*   **D: samahara tonedo walata paeyata saethapum 300k pamana sulangak thibiya haekiya (some tornadoes can have winds of around 300 miles per hour)** - The passage mentions that the winds can be up to 480 km/h (300 mph).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ewa saaman‍yayen paeya thunakata wada pawathee (They usually last more than three hours):** The passage says ""...ithaama prachanda wana siyayata dekak pamana wana tonado paya tunakata vada wadi welawak pawathee"" (Very violent tornadoes, about two in a hundred, last longer than three hours). So, most tornadoes do NOT last that long.

*   **B: ewa paeyata saethapum 480k pamana wegayen yuthu sulan nipadwayi (They produce winds of about 480 miles per hour):** The passage states ""paeyata ki.mee. 480 (thatparayata meetara 133; paeyata saethapum 300) k dakva wana sulang sahitha wei"" (has winds of up to 480 km/h (133 meters per second; 300 miles per hour).

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes Muhammad's habit of going to the cave for meditation (""dyaana waedeema"").
*   The description of the cave highlights its isolation and the sense of being separate from the world.
*   This isolation and the act of meditation suggest that Muhammad valued solitude for spiritual reflection.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: pitatha shabdaya menehi kirimata upakaaree we (helpful in remembering external sounds):** The passage emphasizes isolation, not external sounds.
*   **C: ohuta itha sulu hudekala kaalayak awashya wiya (he needed very little solitude):** The passage implies the opposite. The cave and regular visits show a need for solitude.
*   **D: kawurun ho ohu daekeema ha aeseema pilibandawa saelakilimath wiya (He was concerned about someone seeing and hearing him):** While the cave provides privacy, the primary reason for going there is for spiritual reasons and not to avoid people."
"mema chedayata anuwa, yakada mulinma bhawitha kale kumak sandahada?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: rel peeli haras kanu (rail peeli haras kanu)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that to keep the rails in place, ""haras badhima handunvaa dene ladi"" which translates to ""cross ties/beams were introduced"". These cross ties are the ""rel peeli haras kanu"".
*   The text describes the evolution from wooden cart wheels to iron wheels due to wear and tear, and then mentions the introduction of full iron rail tracks. This shows iron was initially used in cross ties, not the entire track.
Therefore, the text suggests iron was first used for cross beams or ties to support the rails."
"mema chedayata anuwa, lee roda wenuwata yakada roda aadesha karanu laebuwe aeyi?","The correct answer is **D: rel peeli matha wu yakadawalin ewata haani vi thibuni**.

thaak‍shanika nirnaayakaya pilibanda podu adhasa pilibimbu nokaranne pahatha sandahan p‍rakaashawalin kawareda? ,"Let's analyze the passage and the question.

The passage (P) defines technological determinism as the idea that technology heavily influences cultural and political forces, and that technology can ""force"" natural societies into a state of being more socially stratified.

The question (Q) asks which statement *does not* reflect the general idea of technological determinism.

Now let's break down the options:

*   **A: samajayata thaakshanaye balapaema samajiya washayen thathvaropitha kara aetha (The impact of technology on society can be socially stratified)** This *does* reflect the general idea of technological determinism, as it aligns with the passage's assertion that technology can lead to social stratification.

*   **B: thaakshanaye diyunuwa sanskruthiyata balapanne naetha (Technological development does not affect culture)** This *does not* reflect the general idea of technological determinism. Technological determinism, as explained in the passage, *asserts* that technological development significantly impacts culture. This statement directly contradicts that.

*   **C: thaakshanaya samajayata aawenika balapaem aethi karai (Technology has unique effects on society)** This *does* reflect the general idea of technological determinism. It speaks to technology being a major force that creates change in society.

*   **D: thaak‍shanika sanwardhanaya deshapalana balapaem matha padanam nowe (Technological development is not based on political influences)** This *does* reflect the general idea of technological determinism. It aligns with the first idea in the passage - ""thaakshanika diyunuva sanskruthika ha deshapalanika balapamen boho obbata giya magak ganna bawath"" which means, the development of technology has gone beyond the cultural and political influences.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B**. Technological determinism argues that technology *does* impact culture, so a statement saying it doesn't contradicts the concept."

Here's why:

*   The text mentions that early hominids used their hands ""how bara dara gaeneema how gas haraha ellee paeddima sandaha bhavitha nokarayi"" which translates to ""used for carrying loads and climbing through trees.""
*   The passage explicitly states that the chimpanzee's hand is used for ""bara daerima sandaha ath bhavitha kireema"" which means ""using the hand for carrying loads"".
*   The question asks what fossil evidence suggests the hand was primarily adapted for at its end. While other options like ""athina gaman kirima"" (hand walking/brachiation) and ""sancharanaya"" (locomotion) might have been involved, the text primarily emphasizes the adaptation for carrying.

Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
chimpansinge aengili aeta niwaerediwa wisthara karanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda? ,"Let's analyze the provided text and the question to determine the correct answer.

*   **P (Translated):**
    Fossil evidence suggests that early humans may have used their hands for carrying loads and climbing trees before they used them primarily for walking. The chimpanzee's hand is similar in size and length to its foot, reflecting its use for weight-bearing while moving. Human hands are straighter than chimpanzee hands, particularly in the fingers. Fossil bone fragments dating back 2-3 million years suggest that the hand was specializing from locomotion to manipulation.

*   **Q (Translated):**
    Which of the following is a characteristic of chimpanzee fingers?

Now, let's analyze the answer choices:

*   **A: Ewa minisunge ewata wada kelin we (They are less straight than human fingers):** The passage says human hands are straighter than chimpanzee hands, meaning chimpanzee fingers are less straight. This statement aligns with the text.

*   **B: Owunge ath saha pada p‍ramanayen wenas we (Their hands and feet are different in size):** The passage says the chimpanzee's hand is similar in size and length to its foot. So, this is incorrect.

*   **C: Ewa bara dara gaeneema sandaha bhawitha we (They are used for carrying weight):** The passage mentions chimpanzees use their hands for weight-bearing while moving. This statement aligns with the text.

*   **D: Ewa p‍radhaana washayen haesiravima sandaha yoda gaene (They are mainly used for manipulation):** The passage suggests that early *human* hands evolved *towards* manipulation. The passage notes the chimpanzee uses its hands more for weight-bearing and locomotion. This statement does not align with the description of the chimpanzee.

Based on the text, two statements are true: Chimpanzee fingers are less straight than human fingers (A), and they are used for carrying weight (C). However, the question asks about a *characteristic* of chimpanzee fingers, implying a core or defining feature. The main way that chimpanzees use their hands different from humans is carrying weight, so C is slightly more relevant.

Therefore, the best answer is **C**.

It also mentions that animal sources (mushrooms, snails, eggs) are good sources of protein and contain all the essential amino acids. The conclusion is that our ancestors (and chimps) figured out the ""protein problem"".

Therefore, based on the information in the passage, the answer is not explicitly stated. None of the given options are listed as a good source of protein, but rather listed as being difficult to digest.

Since the passage focuses on primates solving the ""protein problem"" in the past, it implies that they found a reliable source of protein, likely animal-based.

"mema chedayata anuwa, ath‍yawashya aemaino amla nomaethikama nisa aethi nowana pahatha sandahan gaetalu walin kawareda?","Based on the passage, the following problems arise due to the difficulty in obtaining essential amino acids, **NOT** due to the *lack* of essential amino acids directly:

*   **B: mandposhanaya (Malnutrition)** - The passage explicitly states that if primates cannot obtain sufficient amino acids, it can lead to adverse consequences, including malnutrition.
*   **C: wardhana aathathiya (Growth retardation/Deficiency)** - Similar to malnutrition, the passage mentions growth problems as a direct consequence of insufficient amino acid intake.
*   **D: maranaya (Death)** - The passage also mentions that if the problem is severe enough and not addressed, the issue can lead to death.

*   **A: aahara jirna gaetalu (digestive issues)** - Although the passage mentions digestive issues, it is in reference to cola varieties and ranila seeds, rather than a result of lacking amino acids.

**Therefore, the answer is A: aahara jirna gaetalu**

Here's why:

* **The question:** Asks how members of a subculture often symbolize their connection to the group.
* **The passage:** States that subculture members ""often receive special recognition and designation through their community membership, history, and sublanguages, as well as distinctive and symbolic forms."" This aligns directly with using style symbolically.
* **Why other options are less likely:**
    * **A: ekaabaddha kirimata uthsaha kirimen (trying to connect)** While connection is important, the question asks *how* they symbolize this connection.
    * **B: owun wata sitina saema kenekugema wishvasayan piligaeneemen (accepting the beliefs of everyone around them)** This contradicts the idea of a subculture, which often has beliefs different from the mainstream.
    * **C: samaja sammathayan piligaeneemen (accepting social conventions)**  Again, subcultures often challenge or deviate from social conventions.

Therefore, using style in a symbolic way is the most accurate and direct answer based on the provided text.

This implies that the awareness of the stereotype negatively impacts their performance.

The question (Q) asks what is likely to happen to a child who identifies with a negatively stereotyped group and is exposed to threatening behavior, according to the theory presented in the passage.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: daruva tharjanathmaka haesireemen vaelakee siteemata uthsaha karanu aetha (The child will try to stay away from threatening behavior).** While generally true for many situations, this doesn't directly relate to the core concept of the passage, which is the internalization of negative stereotypes.

*   **B: daruva tharjanathmaka haesireemata sambandha vimata vaedi idak aetha (The child is more likely to engage in threatening behavior).** This option aligns with the concept of stereotype threat and self-fulfilling prophecy. If a child is aware of negative stereotypes associating their group with aggression or trouble, being exposed to threatening behavior might make them feel like they are confirming the stereotype if they don't push back.

*   **C: samaja thathwayan wethin daruva iwath wanu aetha (The child will withdraw from social situations).** This is a possible response to negative experiences but not the most direct consequence linked to the provided text.

*   **D: daruva wenath vargika sulutharayan samaga katayuthu kirima p‍rathik‍shepa karanu aetha (The child will refuse to interact with other ethnic minorities).** This is less likely than B. The passage doesn't suggest intergroup conflict as the main consequence.

Therefore, the most logical answer based on the passage is **B**. Awareness of negative stereotypes, combined with exposure to threatening situations, can lead the child to be more likely to engage in threatening behavior, potentially fulfilling the stereotype they are aware of.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, vargika ekaakruthi pilibanda daruwekuge daenuma balapaemak aethi kala haekke pahatha sandahan karunu walin kumana karunatada?","The correct answer is **B: owunge haesireema (their behavior)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:**  Racial stereotypes can negatively affect a child's academic performance. If children become aware of negative stereotypes associated with their race, they are more likely to perform poorly academically. This directly relates to their behavior (in this case, academic performance).
* **Option A (owun handuna gaeneemata thora ganna vargika sulutharaya):** While related to racial identity, the passage is more focused on the *impact* of knowing negative stereotypes, not just choosing a racial subgroup.
* **Option C (anek daruwan samaga owunge sambandhathawaya):** The passage focuses on the individual's academic performance, not their relationship with other children.
* **Option D (jathiya pilibanda owunge artha daekvima):** While understanding of race plays a role, the passage's emphasis is on the *behavioral consequence* of stereotype awareness.

Therefore, the passage argues that a child's knowledge of racial stereotypes impacts their *behavior* (specifically, their academic performance), making **B** the most accurate answer.

"mema chedayata anuwa, p‍rachanda daruwange wardhanayata anurupa wiya nohaeki wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: shakthimath sanvada kusalatha (strong communication skills)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes ""feral children"" as being raised outside of normal social interaction.  They are often abandoned, abused, or neglected. Because of these experiences, they are isolated and display behaviors closer to animals than humans. Strong communication skills are learned through social interaction and would be absent in a child raised without it.  The other options (living alone, tendency to isolate, social anxiety) are all consistent with the characteristics of feral children described in the passage.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, pahatha sandahan karunu walin lamun thula p‍rachanda haesireema niwaerediwa wisthara karanne kawareda?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is:

**B: p‍rachanda haesireema adu samajagatha vimen aethiwiya haekiya** (Prachanda behavior can arise from low socialization.)

Here's why:

*   The passage states that one reason for creating an easily accessible process is to focus on children who haven't been properly socialized, neglected, abandoned, or subjected to abuse. These children are labeled as ""prachanda"" (feral or unsocialized). This directly links the ""prachanda"" label and associated behaviors to a lack of proper socialization.

Let's examine why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: shaareerika durwalathawayak nisa bahutharayak p‍rachanda haesireem aethi we** (Most prachanda behaviors arise due to physical weakness) - The passage mentions physical or intellectual disabilities as *reasons* parents might reject a child, potentially leading to the child becoming feral, but not necessarily the direct cause of the ""prachanda"" behavior itself.
*   **C: demapiyan wisin kotu karana lada daruwan thula pamanak p‍rachanda haesireema bahulawa daknata laebe** (Prachanda behavior is most commonly seen only in children framed by their parents) - The passage states that feral children are often treated badly by people (usually their own parents), but doesn't mean it happens exclusively to this group.
*   **D: siyaluma p‍rachanda haesireem darunu buddhimaya aabadha nisa aethi we** (All prachanda behaviors arise due to severe intellectual disabilities) - While the passage mentions intellectual disabilities as a *possible* factor in parental rejection, it's not presented as the sole or universal cause of ""prachanda"" behavior. The primary factor is the lack of proper socialization and care."
"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, yaepum krushikarmayata anukula nowanne pahatha sandahan piliweth atharin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: an ayata wikineema sandaha aahara nishpadanaya kirima** (Producing food for sale to others).

Here's why:

*   **Yaepum Krusikarmaya (Subsistence Farming) Definition:** The passage describes subsistence farming as agriculture focused on producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family. The key element is self-sufficiency, not commercial sale.

Now, let's look at why the other options are *not* correct:

*   **A: gowiyaage pawule awashyatha sapuralana asvaennak kerehi awadhaanaya yomu kirima** (Focusing on harvests that meet the needs of the farmer's family): This is *aligned* with the definition of subsistence farming.
*   **C: diyunu thaak‍shanika k‍rama walata wada ihala asvaennak labaa gaeneema kerehi awadhaanaya yomu kirima** (Focusing on getting a high harvest rather than advanced technological methods): Subsistence farming often relies on simpler methods rather than advanced technologies, and the text says as much, so this is not contrary to the definition.
*   **D: gowiyaage p‍radeshayata desheeya beeja labaa gaeneema** (Obtaining native seeds for the farmer's region): The passage specifically mentions using seeds that are unique to the local environment as a characteristic of yaepum krusikarmaya, so this aligns with the definition.

Therefore, producing food for sale to others directly contradicts the core purpose of subsistence farming, which is to feed the farmer's family, not to generate income from selling surplus.
"

The passage states: ""Dura atitaye sita boho govin yaepum krushikarmaanthaye nirata woo athara boho sanvardhanaya vemin pawathina ratawala meya thawamath siduvemin pawathee."" This translates to: ""Many farmers have been involved in subsistence farming since the distant past, and it is still happening in many developing countries.""
Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: eya mulumaninma kaabanika paddhathiyaki** (it is entirely an organic system) - The passage states it is ""boho vita kaabanika kramavedayaki"" (often an organic method), which means it's *often* organic, but not necessarily *always*.

*   **B: eya asvaenna uparima kirimata anan‍ya thaak‍shanika k‍rarama bhawitha karai** (it uses unique technical methods to maximize yield) - The passage describes it as using ""saapeksava sarala asvanu wadi kireeme thaaksanayan"" (relatively simple yield increasing techniques). ""Sarala"" means simple, contradicting the idea of unique or complex methods for *maximizing* yield.

*   **C: eya govinta owunge wagawan owunge kalapaya pura beda gaeneemata ida salasayi** (it allows farmers to distribute their crops throughout their region) - The passage focuses on producing enough food for the farmer and their family, not distributing crops more widely.

kavuthukaagarayak naerabima kumana sanchaaraka p‍rabhedayata ayath weda?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **C: sanskruthika sanchaaraka karmanthaya (cultural tourism industry)**.

The text defines cultural tourism as: ""Yameku yam niscita sthaanayakata yame aramuna ema sthanaye ithihasaya saha sanskruthiya sambandhava avabodhayak labagaenima nam, mevaeni akaraye sanchaaraka vyaparayak sanskruthika sanchaaraka vyaparaya lesa haedinve.""

This translates to: ""If someone's purpose in going to a particular place is to gain an understanding related to the history and culture of that place, then such a type of tourism activity is identified as a cultural tourism activity.""

Visiting a museum (kavuthukaagarayak) clearly falls under the umbrella of learning about the history and culture of a place, making it cultural tourism.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, winodathmaka sanchaarakayinge p‍ramukhathawayak wiya haekke kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: owunge dainika katayuthu walin witawekayak labaa gaeneema** (to get a break from their daily routines).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Viveka gaenimata saha vinoda weemata minisun thama saamanya dainika jivitayen venas woo wenath sthaanayakata yanne mevitayi."" This translates to: ""It is when people go to a different place from their ordinary daily life to have leisure and entertainment."" This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: desheeya sanskruthiyata anugatha vima** (to follow national culture): While cultural understanding might be a byproduct of some travel, the passage focuses on *recreational* travel, where the primary goal is enjoyment and relaxation. The passage also specifically identifies cultural tourism separately.
* **C: vaedgath bim salakunu naerabima** (to visit important landmarks): Visiting landmarks can be part of *any* type of tourism, including recreational, but it's not the *primary* motivator for recreational tourists according to the text.
* **D: sthaanayaka ithihasaya therum gaeneema** (to understand the history of a place): The passage explicitly states that this is the main purpose of *cultural* tourism, distinguishing it from recreational tourism.

Therefore, B is the most accurate answer based on the provided passage.

The passage explicitly states: ""Evaeni sarthakathvaye kathandara, wenasweema sandaha wana biya adu kala athara idiri kalaye venaskam kerehi dhanatmaka nabhuruwak aethi karana ladi."" This translates to ""Such stories of success, reduce the fear of change and create a positive attitude towards changes in the future."" This directly connects remembering successful events in entrepreneurship to reducing the fear of change.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, kenekuge ithihasaya piliwandawa awabodhayak labaa gaeneema kumak sandaha udaw wiya haekida?","The correct answer is **C: sanwidhaanaya thula sthaanaya pilibanda haegeemak soyaa gaeneema (Finding a sense of place within the organization)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kenekuge ithihasaya avabodha kara gaeneema...eya avama washayen sanvidhaanaye ithihasaya tulata vaetenne kotaenata da yanna pilibanda avabodhayak labaa gaenimata minisunta upakaaree we."" This directly translates to: ""Understanding someone's history... at the very least, it helps people to understand where they fit into the organization's history."" This is essentially finding a sense of place within the organization.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: wenas vima sandaha wu biya adu kirima (Reducing the fear of change):** While the passage does mention that success stories can reduce the fear of change, the *primary* benefit of understanding history is related to one's place in the organization. Reducing fear of change is a *secondary* benefit, connected to reflecting on past successes.
* **B: saaradharma shakthimath kirima (Strengthening core values):** The passage doesn't directly discuss strengthening core values through understanding history, although it could be indirectly related. It primarily focuses on understanding the organization's history and place within it.
* **D: vyavasayaka haesireema vaedi diyunu kirima (Further developing entrepreneurial behavior):** While reflecting on entrepreneurial success stories can help with new directions, understanding one's organizational history is not directly the core driver for developing more entrepreneurial behavior.

**Therefore, the most accurate answer is C, as it directly aligns with the text's explanation of the benefits of understanding one's history in relation to the organization.**

igeneema sandaha wana pashchaath noothana p‍raweshaya niwaerediwa wisthara karanne pahatha sandahan p‍rakaashayangen kawareda?,"Let's analyze the text to determine which statement best describes the postmodern approach to learning.

The text states:

*   ""There is no one best method of learning."" (igena gaenimata hondama ek kramayak kiya deyak naetha.)
*   ""There isn't only one good thing to learn."" (igena ganna saha labaadena daenuma athara athdaekima matha igenuma siduve.

*   Learning is based on experiences, and our current experiences clarify this.  The examples given (TV shows, etc.) demonstrate that we learn about things we might never directly experience.

Based on this, let's evaluate the answer choices:

*   **A: samahara igenum athdaekeem anek ewata wada p‍rayojanawath we (Some learning experiences are more useful than others)** - This contradicts the text's emphasis on there being no single ""best"" method.
*   **B: igeneema apa athwindinu aethaeyi wishvasa karana dewal kerehi awadhaanaya yomu kala yuthuya (Learning should focus on what we believe we experience)** - While experience is mentioned, the text doesn't say that learning *should* focus only on what we believe we experience. It acknowledges learning can happen even from vicarious experiences (like watching TV).
*   **C: samahara igenum k‍rama anek ewata wada hondayi (Some learning methods are better than others)** - This directly contradicts the text's statement that there is no single ""best"" method.
*   **D: igeneemedee kisidu nirapek‍shathawayak nomaetha (There is no absoluteness in learning)** - This aligns with the postmodern perspective presented in the text.  The text rejects the idea of a single ""best"" method or subject of learning. It suggests that learning is relative to experience and that there isn't an objective standard.

Therefore, the best answer is **D: igeneemedee kisidu nirapek‍shathawayak nomaetha (There is no absoluteness in learning)**."
igeneema sandaha wana pashchaath noothana p‍raweshaya niwaerediwa pilibimbu nokaranne pahatha sandahan p‍rakaashayangen kawareda?,"The passage argues against the idea that there's one best way to learn or even one single ""good"" thing to learn. It highlights experiential learning and how we often encounter information (like on TV) about things we'll never directly experience.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: thorathuru igena gaeneemata boho k‍rama thibe (There are many ways to learn information):** The passage *agrees* with this. It emphasizes that there isn't just one method.

*   **B: samahara igenum athdaekeem sandaha wenath athdaekeem walata wada p‍ramukhathwaya labaa diya yuthuya (Some learning experiences should be given more importance than other experiences):** The passage argues *against* this idea. It's a postmodern perspective, suggesting that the value of learning is subjective and depends on the individual's experience and needs. Prioritizing some learning experiences over others contradicts the passage's spirit.

*   **C: igeneeme athdaekeem igena ganna thaenaeththa saha idiripathkarana daenuma matha randa pawathee (Learning experiences depend on the learner and the information presented):** The passage *agrees* with this. It states that learning is shaped by personal experience and how information is presented.

*   **D: api kawadawath bhawitha nokarana daenuma thawamath igena gaeneemata watee (Knowledge we never use is still worth learning):** The passage implicitly *questions* this. While it doesn't explicitly say it's *not* worth learning, the examples of watching TV shows about things we'll never do implies a critique of passively absorbing information that lacks personal relevance. However, it leans closer to being a valid statement compared to option B.

Therefore, the statement that is *not* reflected in the passage (and is arguably contradicted by it) is **B: samahara igenum athdaekeem sandaha wenath athdaekeem walata wada p‍ramukhathwaya labaa diya yuthuya (Some learning experiences should be given more importance than other experiences).**

Here's why:

The passage (P) describes strategies to interrupt the urge to fall back asleep *after* the initial preferred waking time.  It mentions drinking a lot of fluids before bed, specifically to force you to get up to urinate. This makes option B the most directly related solution mentioned in the paragraph to wake someone from sleep.

Here's why:

*   **A:** The passage mentions ""jaivaridma-padanam vikalpavalata"" (biological rhythm-based options), so this is a correct description.
*   **B:** The passage states, ""Oba sampurnayen avadi nokara sihigaenvimata paemina weema..."" (arriving at awareness without completely waking up), making this a correct description.
*   **C:** The passage starts with ""Nindata baadha kireema yanu obey saamanya ninde kaalaya thula..."" (Interrupting sleep is during your normal sleep cycle...), so this is a correct description.
*   **D:** The passage doesn't mention anything about falling asleep again within two hours. The goal is to *interrupt* sleep within a specific window, not to mandate a return to sleep.

Therefore, option D is the only one that is *not* a correct description of interrupting sleep according to the passage."
"molaya nithara nithara sihina daekeemata uthsaha karana wita, eyin vaedi wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: shakthi mattama (energy levels)**.

* **The passage then describes why it's tiring:**  It compares it to waking up every 20-30 minutes to change the TV channel.  This implies disrupted sleep and a drain on energy.
* **Therefore,** when the brain tries to lucid dream frequently, the most direct consequence described is the depletion of energy levels.

Let's eliminate the other options:

* **A: REM thathwayan pramanaya (Amount of REM sleep):** The passage talks about extending the time between normal states and lucid dreaming, not necessarily increasing the overall amount of REM sleep.
* **C: p‍rakurthi thathwayata path vime diga (Length of time in a natural state):** The passage says lucid dreaming can interfere with this, making it *shorter*, not longer.
* **D: REM thathwayan athara kaalaya (Time between REM states):** The passage focuses on the difficulty in extending the time period *between lucid and normal states of consiousness* not the time between REM cycles themselves.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that constantly trying to have lucid dreams can be tiring (vehesakari).
*   It mentions that the main reason for this exhaustion is trying to lengthen the time between lucid dreams and normal states (savgnaanika sihina magin samanya thathwayan athara kaalaya dirgha kireema).
*   It explicitly says that you experience less REM sleep than normal (Raathriyakata vada adu samanya praamana samagin oba sathya ninda athdakina) and your body does not return to its natural state often, which can be problematic (geetaluvak weemata tharam nitharama sidu nove).
*   It compares the experience to waking up every twenty or thirty minutes to change TV channels (obata saema minittu vissakata ho tihakata varak avadi wee rupavahiniya naerambimata siduweema tharam vehesaakaraya), implying disrupted sleep patterns.

Therefore, constantly trying to have lucid dreams leads to **less REM sleep during the night.**

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: REM thathwayan athara keti kaalaya** (Short period between REM states): The text implies disruption of REM cycles overall, not just shortening the periods *between* them.
*   **C: paehaedili sihina daekeema matha randa paewatheema** (Depending on having lucid dreams): This is not a negative impact; it is a condition of the act itself.
*   **D: ek rath‍riyak sandaha wana REM vaedi vima** (More REM for one night): The passage directly states the opposite: lucid dreaming attempts lead to *less* REM sleep."

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sathya """"adushyamaana kandaayamak"""" siteema (larson saha lafasto, 1989, pie109) athathya kandaayamaka thavat suvisesi laksanayaki. """"adrsyamana kandaayama"""" yanu samaajikayin siyalu denama vaarthaa karana kalamanakarana kandaayama wei. adrsyamana kandaayama saema samaajikayekuma sandaha pramiti sakasayi."" This clearly indicates that both traditional and ad-hoc teams report to an ""invisible management team"" (adushyamaana kalamanakarana kandaayama).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kandayam deke kriyaakaarithwaya ekama mattamakin thibenu aethaeyi apekshaa kere (kandayam deke kriyaakaarithwaya ekama mattamakin thibenu aethaeyi apekshaa kere):** The passage highlights differences and independence of ad-hoc teams, suggesting their functionality might *not* be identical.
* **B: kandayam dekatama owunge edineda katayuthu waladee wiwidha mattamwala svayaththathavak aetha (kandayam dekatama owunge edineda katayuthu waladee wiwidha mattamwala svayaththathavak aetha):** The passage explicitly says ad-hoc teams have *more* autonomy than traditional teams, implying they are *not* the same.
* **D: kandayam dekama ekama kaala kalapayaka kriyaathmaka we (kandayam dekama ekama kaala kalapayaka kriyaathmaka we):** The passage states that ad-hoc teams can operate across different time zones, while this is not stated as a condition for traditional teams, implying a difference.

Therefore, the only characteristic both teams share according to the passage is that they report to the same invisible management team.

thekada neethiyata ayath nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The passage describes the ""Rule of Thirds"" in art/photography. It states it helps create a dynamic composition by suggesting the most suitable place for the main subject is at the intersection of horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: wasthuwa sthaanagatha kala haeki sthaanaya sandaha mulika rekhaawak nirmanaya kireema (Creating a basic line for the position where the object can be placed)** - This **IS** related to the Rule of Thirds, as it involves placing the object in a suitable location based on the principle of dividing the scene into thirds.

*   **B: wasthuwak thula jiwitathaya saha shakthiya nirmanaya kireema (Creating life and energy within an object)** - The Rule of Thirds helps with composition and visual appeal, but it doesn't directly *create* life or energy in an object. This is more about the subject itself, lighting, or other artistic techniques.

*   **C: wasthuwa nishchitha ha phaladaayee sthaanayaka thabaa gaeneema (Placing the object in a definite and effective place)** - This **IS** precisely what the Rule of Thirds aims to do – position the subject in an effective spot for visual impact.

*   **D: rupayak thula piliwelak aethi kirima (Creating order in a picture)** - The Rule of Thirds helps to create a sense of order and balance, making the composition more pleasing to the eye. Therefore, this **IS** a direct outcome of applying the rule.

Therefore, the option that is **NOT** associated with the Rule of Thirds is **B: wasthuwak thula jiwitathaya saha shakthiya nirmanaya kireema.**"
mi.mee.35 chayaarupa aakruthiya wisthara nokaranne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: eya dijital kaemara aakruthi wisin sammatha karana ladee** (it is embraced by digital camera shapes).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that digital cameras inherit the aspect ratio from the 35mm format.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: eya thawamath nishpadanaye pawathee** (it is still in production): The passage doesn't confirm or deny this. It mainly discusses its historical significance and relationship to digital formats.
*   **C: eyata boho saaman‍ya aakruthiwalata wada wenas aakaarayaka darshananupathayak aetha** (it has a different aspect ratio than most common shapes): The passage contradicts this, stating that many common formats have the same or similar aspect ratio to 35mm.
*   **D: eya lokaye wadathma podu aakruthiyayi** (it is the most common shape in the world): The passage doesn't claim it's the *most* common, only that it's influential."
"mema chedayata anuwa, nishpadakayin kaacha nishpadanaye gunathmakabhawaya vaedikarana wita, wishalana kaacha vaedi diyunukara aeththe keseda?","The correct answer is **C: owunge chayaarupaye gunathmakabhawaya sthaawara naabhi durak sahitha kaacha walata samana we** (Their photo quality becomes equal to lenses with fixed focal lengths).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Sthaavara naabhiya durak sahitha kaacha magin labaagat gunatmaka bhavayata samaana pintura nipadaweemata meya visalana kacavalata ida dee atha."" This translates to: ""This allows zoom lenses to produce image quality equal to that obtained by lenses with fixed focal lengths.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ewata ihala kaacha wegayak aetha (They have a higher lens speed):** The passage actually says the opposite. Zoom lenses typically have a *lower* maximum aperture (slower speed).
*   **B: adu aaloka thathwayan yatathe ewa bhawitha kirimata pahasuya (They are easy to use in low light conditions):** Again, the passage indicates the opposite. The lower maximum aperture makes them *harder* to use in low light without a flash.
*   **D: ewaye nabheeya dura sankeernathawa p‍radhaana kaachayata wada aduya (Their focal length complexity is less than the main lens):** This doesn't directly address how increased production quality affects zoom lenses. While the complexity may be related, the primary improvement from higher quality production is in image quality, as stated in option C."
"mema chedaye aethi thorathuru matha padanamwa, wishalana kaachayak p‍radhaana kaachayakata wada sudusu wanne kawadada?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: obata vaedi nabheeya sankeernathawayak awashya wanne nam** (If you need higher depth of field complexity).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Visaalana kaachavala avaasiyak naabhigata sankirnatava wana..."" which translates to ""A key advantage of zoom lenses is the ability to navigate complex focal lengths..."" indicating that zoom lenses are preferable when you require variable focal lengths or navigate complex focal lengths.

*   **Option A:** The passage specifically says that zoom lenses generally have a lower maximum aperture (""Kachaye uparima vivaraya (vegaya) saamanyayen pahala ekak weema visalana kacha wala thavat avasiyak wanne ya.""). So, if a high maximum aperture is important, a zoom lens *would not* be suitable.

*   **Option B:** The passage doesn't explicitly say you need less glass constructor ( kaacha sanrachaka) with a zoom lens.

*   **Option C:** The passage says zoom lenses are *less* suitable in low light without flash, due to their lower maximum aperture (""Memagin mila adu visalana kacha flash bhavithayen torava adu aloka thathwayan yatathe bhavitha kirimata apahasu we.""). Therefore, this option is incorrect.

Therefore, **D** is the best answer based on the information provided in the passage.

gupthavadaya pilibanda niwaeredi wistharayak lesa nosaelakenne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"Based on the provided text in Sinhala (which I've translated and interpreted):

*   **P (Summary of Occultism):** Occultism aims for ultimate reality, divinity, or spiritual truth through direct experience, intuition, and union with the divine. It offers a path to nurture intuitive understanding and personal growth. It differs from other religious beliefs through its emphasis on introspective, intelligent, loving, and empathetic nature, focusing on direct personal experience of unique consciousness.
*   **Q (Question):** Which of the following is NOT an accurate explanation of Occultism based on the information provided?
*   **A:** Focuses on achieving empathetic and loving states of consciousness. (Accurate)
*   **B:** Followers of occultism expect a conscious awareness of spiritual truth. (Accurate)
*   **C:** Followers of occultism can follow practices that are conducive to nurturing their insight and sharp intellect regarding divine reality. (Accurate)
*   **D:** The pursuit of direct personal experience distinguishes it from other religious beliefs and traditions. (Potentially misleading - While personal experience is emphasized, the text doesn't definitively say *distinguishes*)

While some of the options seem to capture aspects of the given text, **Option D is the least precise and thus most likely the one that is NOT an accurate, well-supported explanation of occultism based on the given passage.**
The text implies that direct personal experience is a *focus* within occultism, but not necessarily the single defining characteristic *separating* it entirely from all other religious beliefs. Many religions incorporate elements of personal experience or revelation.

**Therefore, the answer is D.**
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, gupthavadaye kendraya nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The passage (P) focuses on personal, direct experience of the divine and spiritual truths. It highlights inner knowing, direct perception of the divine reality, and a personal path to spiritual growth. It also emphasizes the unique, conscious state attained through direct, personal experience.

Based on this, the most accurate answer is:

**C: wingaanaya pilibanda p‍reethimath thathwayak kerehi awadhaanaya yomu kirima** (Focusing attention on a state of loving consciousness.)

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: diwyamaya yathaarthaya thula sahaja buddhiya sevima** (Seeking intuition within the divine reality) - While intuition is involved, the passage emphasizes *direct experience* more than simply seeking intuition.
*   **B: hawul, podu athdaekeem haraha theekshana buddhiya labaa gaeneema** (Gaining sharp intellect through common, shared experiences) - Guptavada emphasizes *individual, unique* experiences, not shared or common ones.
*   **D: dewiyan pilibanda sawingaanika daenuwathbhawayak labaa gaeneema** (Gaining conscious awareness about the divine) - While Guptavada involves gaining conscious awareness of the divine, the core is the *experiential* and *personal* transformation, and the loving state of consciousness, rather than just intellectual understanding.

Therefore, **C** is the best representation of the central focus of Guptavada as described in the passage.

"
"mema chedayata anuwa, maoree warun dadayam kala kandayama palamu vaesiyan wuye kumana sthaanayeda?","The correct answer is **D: polineesiyaawa**.

Here's why:

*   **P states:** Pureland origami was developed by John Smith in the 1970s **as a tool for beginners or those with limited motor skills.** It avoids complex folds and angled lines.

*   **Q asks:** When is Pureland origami useful for a folder?

*   **A:** Implies the folder wants to do only a few folds, but Pureland isn't just about minimizing folds.
*   **B:** Contradicts statement P which states it is for those with **limited motor skills**.
*   **C:** Pureland origami avoids intricate folds, so this isn't a scenario where it would be particularly helpful.
*   **D:** **""Has only tried it once or twice""** aligns directly with the idea that Pureland origami is designed for beginners or those with limited experience.

Therefore, Pureland origami is most useful when someone is new to origami or has very limited experience."

*   **D: seemitha motar haekiyaawan aethi namannan sandaha eya honda k‍ramayaki (It is a good method for folders with limited motor skills)** - Passage P states it was developed for ""athdaekim rahitha namannanta how seemitha motor haekiyaawan yuth ayata upaakarayak lesa"" (as an aid for beginners with limited motor skills).
*   **B: mema k‍ramayata naewatha naemeem aethulath nowe (New folds are not included in this method)** - passage P states ""naewatha naemim waeni vadaat sankirna naeweem valata ida nodena"" (does not allow for new folds and more complex folds), so it doesn't include new folds.

Statement A is incorrect because passage P stated that the method was developed for beginner folders. So the answer is B,C, and D."
"mema chedayata anuwa, indu nimna shishtachaaraya ha sambandha nowana sthaanaya kumakda?","Let's break down the passage and the question:

*   **P (Passage Summary):** The passage describes the Indus Valley Civilization (Indu Nimnaya Sistaachaaraya), associating it with areas of modern-day Pakistan, western India, and northeastern Afghanistan. It mentions the importance of the Ganges and Saraswati river basins and refers to Harappa.

*   **Q (Question):** Which location is *not* associated with the Indus Valley Civilization according to the passage?

Now let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Harappawa (Harappa):** The passage explicitly mentions Harappa as being related to the Indus Valley Civilization. So, this is incorrect.

*   **B: saraswathee gaga (Saraswati Ganges):** The passage discusses the Saraswati and Ganges river basins as part of the region where the Indus Valley Civilization flourished. So, this is incorrect.

*   **C: eesanadiga aefganisthaanaye siyaluma p‍radesha (All areas of northeastern Afghanistan):** The passage mentions that parts of northeast Afghanistan were within the Indus Valley Civilization, but not necessarily *all* areas.

*   **D: noothana pakisthanaye boho p‍radesha (Most areas of modern Pakistan):** The passage states that many regions of current Pakistan are part of the ancient civilization. So, this is incorrect.

Given the wording of the passage, the best answer is **C: eesanadiga aefganisthaanaye siyaluma p‍radesha (All areas of northeastern Afghanistan)**. The passage includes *pradesha* which means areas or parts, but not all of the areas."

*   **P (Translated Key Points):**
    *   Mentions ""Indus Valley Civilization"" influencing areas of Pakistan, Northwest India, and parts of Afghanistan.
    *   Connects the civilization to the prosperity of the Ganges drainage basin.
    *   Speculates about the Saraswati River's role alongside the Ganges in the civilization.
    *   Mentions ""Harappa"" and ""Harappan civilization"", discovered in the 1920s.
*   **Q (Translated):** ""Which of the following names used for the world's oldest civilization, mentioned earlier, is covered by the above references?""

The passage talks about:

*   **Indus Valley Civilization (Indu nimnaya sistaachaaraya)** - This is the overarching civilization.
*   **Harappan Civilization** -  This is a name often used interchangeably with Indus Valley Civilization, especially relating to sites discovered like Harappa.
*   **Indus-Saraswati Civilization (Indu-Saraswathee shishtachaaraya)** - this considers the Saraswati river.
*   **Indus-Ganges Civilization** - Mentions the prosperity of the Ganges, but not named as an official civilization name.

Therefore, the best answer is **B: indu-saraswathee shishtachaaraya**. This choice explicitly acknowledges the speculation in the original passage about the importance of the Saraswati river, which is also mentioned alongside ""Indus Valley Civilization"".

**Final Answer: B**"
"mema chedayata anuwa, digu kaaleena p‍rathilabha labaa gatha haekke pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: an aya samaga sahayogayen katayuthu kirima (working cooperatively with others)**.

**Explanation:**

The passage states that many expect that working together with others is understood to be the best long-term option. This directly links cooperation with long-term benefits. The other options are not directly supported by the passage:

*   **B: kenekuge aathmarthakaameethwayata p‍ramukhathawaya deema (giving priority to one's selfishness):** The passage contrasts short-term selfish actions with the long-term benefits of cooperation.
*   **C: bahutharayata wada sulutharayata p‍rayojanawath wanne kumakda yanna awadhaaranaya kirima (observing what is beneficial to the minority more than the majority):** This concept isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **D: thanhawa p‍rayojanawath wiya haeki bawa handuna gaeneema (recognizing that desire can be beneficial):** While the passage mentions selfishness (which could be linked to desire), it doesn't state that recognizing desire is beneficial for *long-term benefits*. It implies the opposite.

It also mentions that many people hopefully understand that working together is the best long-term choice.

The question asks what someone who is concerned with immediate needs would likely prioritize.

*   **A: pararthakaameethwaya (Altruism):** Altruism is being selfless and concerned for others, which doesn't fit with prioritizing immediate needs.
*   **B: sahayogeethawa (Collaboration):** Collaboration involves working with others, which might not address immediate needs directly.
*   **C: sahayogaya (Cooperation):** Similar to collaboration, cooperation may not be the quickest way to fulfill immediate needs.
*   **D: aathmarthakaamithwaya (Selfishness):** Selfishness focuses on one's own needs and desires, making it the most likely priority for someone concerned with immediate satisfaction.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: aathmarthakaamithwaya (Selfishness)**."

The passage states that the High Middle Ages (when the Templars emerged) followed the Early Middle Ages. Therefore, the Early Middle Ages existed *before* the Templar era.
"
templarwarunge yugayen pasu paeminiye kumana yugayada?,"The correct answer is **A: madhyakaaleena yugaye aga**.

Here's why:

* The passage mentions that the period after the ""high middle ages"" (which included the Templar era) is referred to as the ""late middle ages"" (pascat madyakalina yugaya)
* The question asks what era followed ""the time of the templars.""
* This clearly indicates that the end of the medieval era came after the time of the templars.

The passage states:

*   The Roman Empire, despite its war-like nature, contributed to medicine.
*   Augustus established a medical corps to prevent war-related deaths.
*   Surgeons used morphine (from poppies) and scopolamine (from henbane) as pain relievers.
*   They were skilled at amputations and stopping bleeding with artery clamps.
*   The Roman Empire made advancements in medicine, contributing to modern knowledge.

Now let's analyze the answer options:

*   **A: wiwidha awasaditha samaga pashchaath kampana sahagatha aathathi aabadhayata p‍rathikaara kirima (Treating post-traumatic stress disorder with various medications)** - The text doesn't explicitly mention treating PTSD. While war traumas would certainly exist, there is no direct mention of this.

*   **B: skopolamain nissaranaya sandaha shakasara beeja bhawitha kirima (Using henbane seeds for scopolamine extraction)** - The text states that scopolamine was derived from harben (henbane), so this is mentioned as something that was used.

*   **C: dhahamani kalampa samaga rudhiraya gala yaama valakva gaeneema (Stopping bleeding with artery clamps)** - The passage directly states surgeons used artery clamps to stop bleeding.

*   **D: gaengreen rogeenge awayawa kapa iwath kirima (Cutting off limbs of gangrene patients)** - The passage states that they were skilled at amputations. While it doesn't explicitly mention gangrene patients, it is implied since gangrene often results in the need for amputation.

Based on the options that are explicitly mentioned, Options B, C, and D are all correct. Therefore, by process of elimination, **the only option not mentioned in the text is A (Treating post-traumatic stress disorder with various medications).**
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, roma adhirajyaye waidya k‍sheth‍raye sidu wu diyunuwata sambandha nowanne pahatha sandahan dae walin kawareda?","Based on the provided text, the advancement of medical science in the Roman Empire was facilitated by:

*   **Gathering doctors across the Empire.**
*   **Painkillers were used during surgeries.**
*   **Cutting off limbs and Stopping of the flow of blood by using artery clamps**
*   **The conquest of many things into the field of medicine.**

So, based on the information, **C: igenum rohalak pihituvima (establishment of a teaching hospital)** is not explicitly mentioned as a direct factor contributing to medical advancements in the Roman Empire in the provided passage. While it's plausible that teaching hospitals existed, the text doesn't highlight them as a key driver of progress.

Therefore, the answer is **C**."
daekeeme haekiyaawa kumak matha randa pawatheeda?,"Based on the prompt, the answer is most likely **C: aethaem tharanga aayaama sanwedeethawa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""...venas idikireem, venas haekiyaawan sahitha, venas **tharanga ayamayanta sanvedi**, venas thivrathavan...""

*   The question asks what the ability to ""daekeeme haekiyaawa"" (which I understand to mean ""ability to see"" or ""visual ability"") depends on.

*   Option C aligns directly with the phrase ""tharanga ayamayanta sanvedi"" (sensitive to wavelengths). The passage indicates that different visual abilities require sensitivity to varying wavelengths.

* Options A, B and D are incorrect as the passage relates them to other elements, not necessarily to the core function of visual ability."

*   **A: tharanga aayaama sanwedeethawa (Wavelength sensitivity):** The passage explicitly mentions that variations in sensitivity to different wavelengths play a role.
*   **B: jivinge awashyatha (Living being's requirements):** The passage explicitly mentions that the needs (awashyatha) of the living being influence the structure.
*   **C: theewratha mattama (Intensity level):** The passage explicitly mentions that intensity(theevrata) influences structure.
*   **D: jivinge sankeernathwaya (Living being's complexity):** The passage states sexual needs in living beings are complex parameters and exist in diverse forms.

However, the best answer will be **B: jivinge awashyatha (Living being's requirements)** because it is the most encompassing as all the other options come under awashyatha.

"mema chedayata anuwa, aagama niwaerediwa nirupanaya nokarana seek dhahama pilibanda wu p‍rakaashaya wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: guru yanu seek aagamata aawenika wu mulika angayaki** (guru is a fundamental component unique to the Sikh religion).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that while the concept of a 'guru' is present in many Indian religions, Sikhism elevates it to the foundation of their beliefs. Therefore, the guru is NOT unique to the Sikh religion, but rather a fundamental and highly prioritized aspect.

Let's analyze the other options:

*   **A: seek dhahama yanu hindu samp‍radaye nikaayavadee bedeemwala p‍rathiphalayaki** (Sikhism is the result of sectarian divisions in the Hindu tradition). - The passage states that Sikhism originated as a break from Hindu traditions in the 15th century, so this is correct.
*   **C: mema aagame nirmathru guru nanakgen pasuwa gurun nawa denek ohuwa anugamanaya kalaha** (After Guru Nanak, the founder of this religion, nine gurus followed him). - While the passage doesn't explicitly state that there were nine gurus after Nanak, it's a widely known fact about Sikhism and consistent with the passage.
*   **D: seek dhahame aethaem samp‍radayan hindu dhahame mul baesa aetha** (Some traditions in Sikhism have roots in Hinduism). - The passage mentions that Sikhs recognize their Hindu roots and traditions, so this is correct.

Therefore, B is the only statement that inaccurately represents information presented or implied in the passage."
"mema chedayata anuwa, seek wishvasaye mulika angaya lesa salakanu labanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: guru sankalpaya**.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: hindu samp‍radayan:** The passage states that Sikhism originated as a branch of Hinduism, but it also emphasizes that Sikhism is a distinct religion. So, Hinduism is not the *core* tenet of Sikh faith.
* **C: wenath indiyaanu aagam piligaeneema p‍rathik‍shepa kirima:** The passage doesn't mention that Sikhism rejects other Indian religions.
* **D: panjabi bhashawa katha kirima:** While Punjabi is important to Sikhism, speaking Punjabi is not presented as the core belief. The term ""Gurmat"" (""way of the Guru"") is in Punjabi."
"mema chedayata anuwa, awadhaana oonatha aabadhaya sahitha daruwanta awadhaanaya yomu kirimata apahasu wiya haekke kumak sandaha da?","The correct answer is **A: pasal vaeda** (schoolwork).

The passage states that children with ADD find it difficult to focus on tasks like schoolwork (""pasal waeda waeni de wetha avadhaanaya yomu kireema apahasu wana""). While they can focus on things they enjoy, schoolwork is specifically mentioned as a difficult area.

"mema chedaye aethi thorathuru walata anuwa, palanchiyakata udaharanayak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","Let's break down the passage and the question.

The passage says:

*   ""Palanchiya piyavarak obbata yay"" - Coaching is similar to a parent.
*   ""Aadharaka sapayima yanu igenime kramayak nova nava pariganaka vaedasatahanak bhavitha kireema ho nava vyaaprtiyak aarambha kireema waeni nava igenum athdaekimak labana ayata sahaya labaa dene aadharayak pamani"" - Supporting is not a learning method, but rather support to achieve a new learning experience.
*   ""Palanchiya athathya haa saebae viya haekiya, wenath wachana valin kivahot, guruvarayeku yanu palanchiyaka svarupayaki, namuth microsoft ofis hi kudaa kadadasi clip minisa da esemaya"" - Coaching is both physical and cyber, ie: a teacher is a type of coach, and even the Microsoft Office paperclip is too.

The question asks: Which of the following is NOT an example of a coach?

Let's look at the options:

*   A: Pariganaka kreedawaka aarambhaye dee maga penvima - Providing guidance at the start of a computer game
*   B: SAT upadeshakayek - An SAT tutor
*   C: Svadheena adhyayana vaedasatahanak - An independent study website
*   D: Podi leeg puhunukaruwek - A Little League coach

Based on the passage, a coach is someone who helps you question, reflect, and improve understanding.  A tutor, a sports coach, and even initial guidance in a game can fit that description.

Option C describes something designed for independent study - there is no active role of a coach pushing and questioning.

So the answer is **C: svadheena adhyayana vaedasatahanak**.

*   **C: eya wyaapruthi padanam karagath igeneema lesa da haendinwe (It is also known as project-based learning)** - *This is NOT explicitly mentioned in the text. The text discusses using support in situations like starting a new business or using new software, but it doesn't equate support directly with project-based learning.*

*   **D: igeneeme athdaekeemak aarambhaye dee sahaya labaa deema sandaha palanchiya bhawitha karai (Mentoring is used to provide support at the beginning of a learning experience)** - *This is also explicitly supported: ""Aadharaka sapayima yanu... nava igenum athdaekimak labana ayata sahaya labaa dene aadharayak pamani.""

"mema chedayata anuwa, kiyavime apahasuthawayak aethi sisunta kumana MySpace wisheshangaya p‍rayojanawath wiya haekida?","The correct answer is **A: risikaranaya**.

The passage states: ""Eya kiyavimata pahasu karavima pinisa menma, kaemaeti ayurin varna adu wadi karagaenimata haeki ayurin risikaranaya karagata haekiya."" This translates to ""It can be customized to make it easier to read and adjust the colors as desired.""  This specifically addresses reading difficulties.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: bloga:** While blogs are a feature, they don't directly address reading difficulties.
*   **C: ek web lipinayak:** A single web address makes access easy, but doesn't help with reading itself.
*   **D: paethikada miliyana 54:** This is just a statistic about the number of profiles and doesn't help with reading difficulties."
"mema chedayata anuwa, kamkaruwange kaerali koolahalawalata krushchewge p‍rathichaaraya nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: nawa agamaethiwarayeku path kirima** (Appointing a new leader).

Here's why:

The passage states that Khrushchev eventually agreed to appoint Władysław Gomułka as the new leader, a popular figure, and made some economic concessions to appease the public. This was his reaction to the protests.

Let's break down why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: saamaya yali sthaapitha kirimata yudha taenki bhawitha kirima** (Using war tanks to re-establish peace): The passage mentions tanks being sent to establish peace. While true, this was a *means* to an end (re-establishing peace) and not the *ultimate* reaction or agreement. The final agreement was Gomułka's appointment.
*   **C: vaetup kappaduwa vaedi kirima** (Increasing wage cuts): The passage refers to wage cuts (""vaetup kappaaduvata""), but it doesn't explicitly state that Khrushchev's reaction was to *increase* these cuts. The protests were *against* the cuts.
*   **D: samahara aarthika illeem piligaeneema** (Accepting some economic concessions): This is also part of the response. However, it is not the main thing that was agreed to.

Therefore, appointing Gomułka is the best answer."
polantha kaerali koolahalawalata hethuwa nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The passage states that the riots in Poland in June 1956 were due to food shortages and wage cuts and evolved into a general protest against communism.

Therefore, the reasons for the riots *include* food shortages and wage cuts. The question asks which of the options was *not* a cause of the riots. Vladislav Gomulka's appointment was a *result* of the riots, not a cause.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: Wladislaw Gomulka's appointment.

"mema chedayata anuwa, USSR sha the USA athara sambandhathawayata balapaemak nowuye pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: germaniya pilibanda adhas (opinions about Germany)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:**
    *   Cooperation between the USSR and USA was driven by Germany being a common enemy in WWII.
    *   After the war, differences in systems, processes, and culture led to a split.
    *   These differences fueled the Cold War.

*   **Analysis of the options:**

    *   **A: sanskruthika wenaskam (cultural differences):** The passage *explicitly* mentions cultural differences as a reason for the split.
    *   **B: germaniya pilibanda adhas (opinions about Germany):** The passage suggests that their *agreement* about Germany during the war *facilitated* the relationship, but doesn't mean their individual opinions about Germany *after* the war were a primary driver of the split or the Cold War. Once Germany was defeated, the *lack* of a common enemy allowed existing ideological and systemic differences to come to the forefront.
    *   **C: ekinekaata paraspara kriyaawaleen (interacting processes):** The passage mentions processes as a source of conflict.
    *   **D: paddhathi pilibanda aarawul (disputes about systems):** The passage mentions systems as a source of conflict.

Therefore, while Germany was initially a factor in their *cooperation*, the key drivers of the USSR-USA split, according to the passage, were differences in systems, processes, and culture. Therefore the only option that did *not* influence is related to Germany."

*   **Q (Question):** The question asks which of the provided options are addressed when the purpose of sending nerve impulses throughout the body is fully described and detailed.

Now, let's consider each option:

*   **A: rudhira gamanagamanaya mandgamee vima (Slowing down blood circulation):** The passage doesn't directly mention nerve impulses being primarily for slowing down blood circulation.
*   **B: rudhira gamanagamanaya kalamanakaranaya kirima (Managing blood circulation):** Managing circulation is not the key purpose.
*   **C: samasthithiya nisi lesa pawathvagena yaama (Maintaining homeostasis properly):** The passage explicitly states that nerve impulses help maintain homeostasis.
*   **D: siduwiya haeki shareerika tharjana walakva gaeneema (Preventing potential physical threats):** The passage also mentions that nerve impulses help protect the body from threats.

**Therefore, the best answer is C and D.**"

Here's why:

*   The text states that Alexander offered to rebuild the temple but his request was rejected.
*   It then says the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC, after Alexander's death.

Therefore, the temple was rebuilt *after* Alexander's reign."

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Americans tried to move people and resources across the Atlantic to help Britain.
*   German sailors, mainly through U-boats, tried to stop this traffic.
*   The passage concludes that *if* the Allies (Britain and America) had failed, Germany could have conquered Britain. This implies the Allies succeeded.

Therefore, Britain and America (the Allied forces) were ultimately more successful in the North Atlantic naval campaign."

Here's why:

*   The passage states that only priests were allowed into the inner sanctum or ""abyantara suddhasthaanaya.""

The other options are incorrect because:

*   A: The passage says that the open temple courtyard (""devala anganayak"") was accessible.
*   B: The passage doesn't restrict the general public from participating in festivals at the main temple.
*   C: The passage doesn't restrict participation in festivals in the outer courtyard of the temple."
pujakayan sandaha wishesha yana lesa adhas kale pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: abhyanthara shuddhasthaana**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Saema devalayakama vivurta devala anganayak saha pujakayanta pamanak aetulu viya haeki abyantara suddhasthaanayak viya."" This translates to ""Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctum that only priests could enter."" This clearly indicates the inner sanctum (abhyanthara shuddhasthaana) was reserved specifically for priests.

Let's examine the other options:

*   **A: uthsawa (festivals):** While priests were involved in festivals, the passage doesn't imply festivals were exclusively for them.
*   **C: aagamika mangal‍ya (religious ceremonies):** Similar to festivals, priests officiated ceremonies, but the ceremonies weren't solely for the priests.
*   **D: sigurata (ziggurats):** Ziggurats had a special shrine at the top, but the passage doesn't directly state the priests were the only ones to access/use them. The primary indication is that the *inner sanctum* was exclusively for priests.

Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Kese vethath, 1922 dee ohuge sohon geya soyaagaenimat samaga ohu janapriya vuveya."" (However, he became popular with the discovery of his tomb in 1922).
* The passage also mentions that other tombs were robbed, but Tutankhamun's was not, further emphasizing the significance of the discovery.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: purana raja laeyisthuwe ohuge thaththwaya (his status on the ancient king list):** The passage states the opposite - his name *wasn't* included in many ancient king lists.
* **C: ohuge sohonen kavuthuka wasthu dhas gananak sora gaeneema (stealing thousands of artifacts from his tomb):** The passage states that his tomb *wasn't* looted.
* **D: purana eejipthu yugaye ohuge vaedgathkama (his importance in the ancient Egyptian era):** The passage says he wasn't considered very important in his time.
"
greeka kawiyeku wana homarta kala nohaeki wuye kumakda?,"The passage states that Homer wrote two invaluable works of Greek literature, the Iliad and the Odyssey. This means he was a poet. Therefore, the thing a Greek poet like Homer *could not* have done is related to poetry. Let's look at the options:

*   **A: aeseema (writing)** - He *could* write; he wrote famous poems.
*   **B: daekeema (seeing)** - This is not directly related to writing or poetry. However, the question asks about *what Homer COULD NOT do*. If Homer was blind, it would limit his ability to write.
*   **C: aewideema (living)** - Obviously, a poet needs to live to write.
*   **D: katha kirima (talking)** - Homer *could* talk. Talking would be essential for many aspects of life.

Based on this, the most likely answer is **B: daekeema (seeing)**. If Homer were blind, that would impair his ability to write (especially in a time before Braille or advanced dictation technology).

Therefore the answer is **B**."

Let's examine the other options:

*   **A: putu wala idagena kaema kana duppath amuththan:** The passage mentions that poor people and farmers ate while sitting on chairs.
*   **B: golubellan sandaha wu aahara ruchiya:** The passage mentions that dormice (golubellan) were considered a delicacy among the Romans.
*   **C: dhanawath minisun aahara ganna atharathura bima vaethira siteema:** The passage says that wealthy people preferred to eat at banquets while reclining."
"chedaya matha padanamwa, kalpawathna balapaemak aethi kala nohaekke pahatha daekwena ewayin kawareda?","The passage discusses civilization (Sistaacharayak) and culture (Sanskrtiyak). It states that civilization involves cooperation, living together, sharing a culture, and being a large society.

The question asks which of the options *can* have a lasting impact, influencing events over time.

*   **A: Samajayak (Society):** Societies can have a lasting impact and influence events over time.
*   **B: Sulu sanskruthiyak (Small culture):** The passage explicitly says small cultures often disappear without leaving historical traces and aren't considered civilizations. Thus, less likely to have a lasting impact.
*   **C: Nagara-rajyayak (City-state):** While city-states can be influential for a period, their impact might be limited by their size and duration.
*   **D: Shishtachaara sanskruthiyak (Civilized Culture):** Civilizations, by definition, have a profound and lasting impact, transmitting traditions and cultural foundations.

Considering the passage, a **civilized culture** is the strongest answer, best exemplifying a lasting impact. A society is also correct to an extent as society has a lasting impact over time, but the passage puts more emphasis on civilized culture.

Therefore, the best answer is **D: shishtachaara sanskruthiyak**

*   **D: eya nirmanaya kale sabdrung ngavaeng namjiyel wisini** (It was built by Subbedrang Navang Namgyel)

*   **A: eya idikarana ladde tibet-mongoliyaanu hamudawange jayagrahanaya saemareema sandahayi** (It was built to commemorate the victory of the Tibetan-Mongolian armies) - The text states it was built to commemorate *his* victory *against* them.
*   **B: eya bhoothanaye pihita aetha** (It is located in Bhutan) - While likely true based on the context, the passage focuses on other aspects and does not directly state the location of Bhutan.
*   **C: ginnakin balakotuwe natabun bohomayak winasha wiya** (The remains of the fort were largely destroyed by fire) - The text mentions that the fire damaged some ruins, but it only mentions only a few remains were lost."

* **The passage states:** ""1951 dee, drukgiyaal dongehi ginna hatagatte, sabrang nagawang naemgalge rupaya waeni natabun kihipayak pamanak ithiri karamini.""  This translates to: ""In 1951, a fire broke out at Drukgyaal Dzong, leaving only a few structures of Sabdrung Ngawang Namgyal's remains.""  Therefore, only remains of Sabdrung Ngawang Namgyal remain after the fire.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: tibet-mongoliyaanu hamudawan jayagrahanaya kalaha** (Victory over the Tibetan-Mongolian army): While the Dzong was built to commemorate this victory, the *fire's* result wasn't this victory. The victory predates the fire by hundreds of years.
* **C: mema aakarshanaye janap‍riyathawayata kisidu balapaemak sidu vi nomaetha** (There was no impact on the popularity of this attraction): The passage does not directly state that the fire affected the popularity of the attraction.
* **D: eya sabdrung ngavaeng namjiyel sanrakshanaya kale ya** (It preserved Sabdrung Ngawang Namgyel): The fire damaged the fortress, so it cannot be said it preserved him.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""18 wana siyavasedi thaayivarun kihipa varakma kaambojaya arkramena kala athara 1772 dee nom pen nagaraya vinasha kara daemuvoya.""  This translates to: ""In the 18th century, the Thais invaded Cambodia several times and destroyed the city of Phnom Penh in 1772.""  Therefore, Thai people (thayiwarun) destroyed Phnom Penh (nom pen).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: wiyatnama jaathikayan nom pen winasha kalaha:** The passage states that the Vietnamese (wiyatnaamavarun) invaded Cambodia in the latter part of the 18th century, but it doesn't specifically mention them destroying Phnom Penh.
* **B: 1772 dee kaambojaya thailanthaya aakramanaya kaleya:** The passage states that Thailand attacked Cambodia, not the other way around.
* **C: 18 wana shathawarshaye aarambhaye dee wiyatnama jaathikayan wisin kaambojaya aak‍ramanaya karana ladee:** The passage indicates Vietnamese invasions towards the end of the 18th century, not at the beginning.

Here's why:

* **P says:** ""18 wana siyavasedi thaayivarun kihipa varakma kaambojaya arkramena kala..."" This translates to ""In the 18th century, Thais attacked Cambodia several times...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** ""wiyatnam jaathikayan kihipa wathawakma kaambojaya aak‍ramanaya kalaha"" - While the passage mentions Vietnamese attacking Cambodia, it's primarily focused on the Thai attacks in the first part.
* **B:** ""thai saha wiyatnama jaathikayan 1772 dee kaambojaya aak‍ramanaya kalaha"" - The passage mentions the Thais destroying Phnom Penh in 1772, but not a joint Thai/Vietnamese attack.
* **C:** ""wiyatnama jaathikayan nom pen winasha kalaha"" - The passage specifically states the Thais destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate reflection of the information provided in the passage."

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the Qing dynasty took control of Taiwan in 1683, *long after* the Dutch East India Company established itself there in 1624. The Dutch would not have been in a position to *give* control of the island to the Qing Dynasty.
*   **A:** The passage states the Dutch East India Company established itself in the northern region of Taiwan.
*   **B:** The passage directly states that the Dutch East India Company converted indigenous crops.
*   **C:** The passage indicates the Dutch East India Company hired Chinese laborers to work on sugar plantations, which indicates some labor.

Therefore, option D is the only statement that the Dutch East India Company could not have done while in Taiwan."

"
rasayanika drawyayaka pH mattama maninu labanne keseda?,"The correct answer is **C: rasayanikaya thula aethi hayid‍rajan ayana p‍ramanaya matha** (depending on the amount of hydrogen ions in the chemical).

**Explanation:**

The passage explains that pH indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (H+) in a substance. A lower pH indicates a higher concentration of hydrogen ions (more acidic), while a higher pH indicates a lower concentration of hydrogen ions (more alkaline/basic).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the pH *indicates* whether a chemical is acidic or basic, measuring the pH is directly about quantifying the hydrogen ion concentration, not just determining acidity/basicity in a general sense.
*   **B:** Protons are related, but measuring the *amount* of protons directly isn't how pH is determined. It's specifically the *concentration of hydrogen ions* (which are protons).
*   **D:** The number of electrons is not directly related to pH. pH is a measure of hydrogen ion concentration."
hayidrajan ayana walin iwath karana ladde kumakda?,"The passage states: ""Hayiderajan ayana yanu ein electrona ivath woo protona wei"". This translates to: ""Hydrogen ion is one with an electron removed, and a proton.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: protona**.

*   **A: owun balu raelakata samana widihata haesireyi (They behave similarly to a pack of dogs)** - The passage explicitly states, ""sinha prayids kriya karanne haesirimen pudhuma sahagata lesa sinhayinta samaana vurka ho sunakha raelakata samaana ayurin wana athara..."" (Lion prides behave in a surprisingly collaborative manner, similar to packs of lions or dogs). So, this statement is true.

*   **B: pirimi-gaehaenu anupathaya samana nowe (The male-female ratio is not equal)** - The passage states that a pride consists of ""1 sita 3 dakva woo gnaathi vaedihiti pirimi sathun saha 30k pamana wana gaehaenu sathun ha paetavungeni"" (1 to 3 related adult males and about 30 females and cubs). This clearly indicates an unequal male-female ratio. So, this statement is true.

*   **C: pirimi saha gaehaenu haemoma sameepa lesa sambandhayi (All males and females are closely related)** - The passage states ""Ek vishaala pavulaka sahodariyan saha diyanivarun vemin gaehaenu sathun saamaanyayen ekinekata sameepa gnatitvayak darayi"" (The females generally share a close kinship to each other, being sisters and daughters in one large family). It explicitly mentions close kinship among females, but not necessarily between males and females. Only the adult male lions are related to each other. The passage does not say all males and females are closely related.

*   **D: e dekama maranthika saha samajiyai (Both are deadly and social)** - The passage states that prides behave collaboratively and are deadly to their prey (""emenma haesirime dee ovunge godurata itha maaraantika ya""). This implies both social behavior and deadliness.

Therefore, the statement that is *not* a correct description of a lion pride, based on the passage, is:

**C: pirimi saha gaehaenu haemoma sameepa lesa sambandhayi (All males and females are closely related)**"
sinhayange haesireema niwaerediwa wisthara nokaranne pahatha sandahan p‍rakaashawalin kawareda?,"Let's break down the original text and the options to find the statement that incorrectly describes lion behavior.

**Understanding the Text (P):**

*   Lions are social animals living in prides.
*   Prides consist of 1-3 related males, around 30 females, and cubs.
*   Females in a pride are closely related, like sisters and daughters.
*   Lion behavior is similar to wolves or dogs in packs (but not other large cats).
*   They are deadly to their prey.

**Analyzing the Options (Q):**

*   **A: owun godak samajasheeleeyi (They are very social):** The text clearly states lions live in prides and have strong social bonds, so this *is* an accurate description.
*   **B: owunge haesireema wurkayange haesireemata samanayi (Their behavior is similar to wolves):** The text explicitly compares lion behavior to wolves or dogs, so this *is* an accurate description.
*   **C: pirimi saha gaehaenu yana dewargayama owunge goduruta athishayinma maranthikayi (Both males and females are deadly to their prey):** While the text states the group is deadly to their prey, it doesn't explicitly specify both males and females are responsible in the hunt. Also, the question asks about behavior and not their hunting ability.
*   **D: owunge haesireema anekuth wishala balalunta samanayi (Their behavior is similar to other large cats):** The text explicitly states that their behavior is *not* like other large cats, but rather like wolves or dogs.

**Conclusion:**

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: owunge haesireema anekuth wishala balalunta samanayi (Their behavior is similar to other large cats)**. This is the statement that incorrectly describes lion behavior based on the provided text."

*   They hunt at night because they have good night vision.
*   They hunt various animals, including monkeys, snakes, mice and sometimes squirrels.

The question asks which of the following is *not* a part of American bobcats hunting strategy.

*   A: blending into their surrounding: This is stated in the passage.
*   B: tracking prey by smell: This is stated in the passage.
*   C: stalking prey at night: This is stated in the passage.
*   D: only hunting small animals: This is incorrect, as the text mentioned they hunt monkeys, snakes, squirrels and even mice.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: kuda p‍ramanaye sathun pamanak godurata gaeneema** (only hunting small animals)."

*   **B:** ""owun rahase hemin seeruwe gaman karai"" (They move secretly and slowly) - The passage states ""...ithaa rahasin hemin seeruwe aevidimatada haekiya."" (...they can also sneak around very secretly and slowly). This is TRUE.

*   **C:** ""owunge iwa aelleema durwalayi"" (Their eye aiming is weak) - The passage *doesn't* mention eye aiming being weak. It describes their good night vision, but says nothing about poor aim. This is LIKELY FALSE.

*   **D:** ""owun kuda sathun dadayam kirimata kaemaeththak dakwayi"" (They show a liking for hunting small animals) - The passage mentions ""vanduran, sarpayan, meeyan saha haeki nam kurullan da allaa ganiti"" (monkeys, snakes, mice, and birds if available, are caught). This is TRUE.

Therefore, the statement that is *not* accurately described in the passage is **C**.

**Final Answer: C**
"
kotiyakuge wishalathama shakthiya lesa salakanu nolabanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawarakda?,"The correct answer is **A: garjanaya (Roaring)**

Here's why:

The passage states:

*   The tiger's roar is *not* a full roar like a lion's; it's more of a growl-like sequence of sounds.
*   The passage mentions the tiger's ability to climb, swim, long jump, and pull with 5 times the strength of an average man, meaning these are strong abilities of the tiger.
*   The passage focuses on the fact that only lions, tigers, leopards, and jaguars can roar.

Therefore, the passage focuses on the roaring of the tiger not being like that of the lion or other animals in the Panthera family.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, kotin saha sinhayan athara wenasa kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: owunge garjanaye handa (their roar sound)**.

The passage specifically states that a tiger's roar is different from a lion's full roar, comparing it to a gravelly, barking word sequence. This highlights a key difference in their vocalizations. While the passage mentions other abilities, the only explicitly stated difference between lions and tigers is their roar.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, robat hook wenath jiwa widyaangayinta pera kale kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: miya giya saila nireekshanaya kirima** (observing dead cells).

The text states: ""Sailaya yanna paminenne kudaa kamaraya yanna haengavena latin wachanayak wana selaa yanneni."" This directly translates to ""Sailaya comes from the Latin word 'cella' which means 'kudaa kamaraya' (small room).""
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, boho sathunta kumak kirimata haekiyaawak thibeda?","The correct answer is **B: chalanaya vimata** (to move).

The passage states: ""boho sathunta chalanaya weemata haeki ya"" (many animals can move). Therefore, according to the passage, many animals have the ability to move.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, samahara sathunta nomaethi de kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: molaya (brain)**.

The passage states: ""Molayak aeththe sathunta pamani (eheth siyaluma satuntat naetha; udaaharanayak lesa jelifish nam mathsyayanta molayak naetha)."" which translates to ""Only animals have brains (but not all animals; for example, jellyfish do not have brains).""

This means some animals do not have brains. The other options (shells, the ability to digest food, and the ability to obtain food) are all mentioned as characteristics of animals in general.

* **Translation:** The passage explains that plants produce their own food through photosynthesis (""Shaaka ovunta awashya aahaara hirugen  nipadava ganne prabhaasanslesanaya tulini."").
* **Question:** The question asks what benefit plants get from photosynthesis.
* **Answer:**  Photosynthesis is how plants create their food (aahara).

Therefore, the answer is C.

"mema chedayata anuwa, parinamaye kriyaawaliyata badhaa karanne pahatha daekwena udaharanawalin kawareda?","The passage describes speciation, which is the process by which new species arise through adaptation to different environments over long periods. The key steps are:

1.  **Isolation:** A small group splits off from the main population.
2.  **New environment:** This group faces a new environment with different resources and competitors.
3.  **Adaptation:** The group adapts to the new environment, developing different traits.
4.  **Divergence:** Over time, the group becomes so different from the original population that they can no longer interbreed, forming a new species.

The question asks which of the examples *impedes* (hinders) the process of evolution described.

*   **A: kuda kandayamakata nawa sthaanayaka samruddhimath vimata apohosath vima (A small group is unable to thrive in a new location.)** If the small group *fails to thrive*, then adaptation and divergence cannot occur. This **prevents** speciation.

*   **B: ek gahanayakin kotasak nawa parisarayakata wen vi yaama (A portion of a population separates to a new environment.)** This is the starting point for speciation.

*   **C: nawa parisarayak thula anuwarthanaya vimata haeda gaeswena gahanayak (A population adapts to thrive in a new environment.)** This is a key step *in* the process of speciation.

*   **D: eka janagahanayak awasanaye dekak bawata path vima (A single population eventually becomes two.)** This is the *result* of speciation.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A**.

Here's why:

*   The passage clearly states that speciation occurs *because* the new population adapts to its new environment. It's the adaptation that drives the divergence from the original population. If a population *cannot* adapt, it would likely go extinct, not speciate.

The other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **B: meya parinameeya kriyaawaliye p‍radhaana angayaki** (This is a key component of the evolutionary process) - The passage explicitly states that speciation is a very important part of evolution.
*   **C: eya nawa wishesha jananayak aethivima gaena sandahan karai** (It refers to the emergence of new species) - Speciation is, by definition, the process of forming new species.
*   **D: eya siduvima vaelaekwiya nohaeki ya** (It is unavoidable to happen) - The passage states speciation is an inevitable consequence (vaelaekviya nohaeki prativipaakayak).

This translates to: ""Most insects have the advantage of being able to retract their wings along their body. This gives them a wider range for hiding from predators.""

Therefore, the ability to retract wings increases the range of hiding, which corresponds to option B.

So the answer is **B: saegavime paraasa (range of hiding)**.
"

It also mentions that most insects can fold their wings back along their bodies, giving them a wider range to hide from predators.

The passage discusses the *advantages* of wing folding for survival and efficiency. It implies wing folding affects how an insect:

*   Finds food (aahara saha sahakaruvan vadaat kaaryakshamava soyaa gaenimatat - ""finding food and partners more efficiently"")
*   Escapes predators (saturan vadaat pahasuven maga haerimatat - ""escape predators more easily"")
*   Hides (vilopingen saengava siteema sandahaa vadaa pulul paraasayak labaa dei - ""gives them a wider range to hide from predators"")
*  Efficiency (kaaryak‍shamathawa)

However, the passage does not mention reproduction or lifespan as factors *directly affected by* the ability to fold wings.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: p‍rajananaya (Reproduction)**. The passage does not mention how wing folding affects reproduction."

This indicates that Mohenjo-daro had a very high proportion of houses with this type of toilet system. The other options are mentioned as having toilets, but not with the same level of system described for Harappa and Mohenjo-daro.
"

It also mentions that ruins of sewage systems have been found in Crete and Santorini. It also mentions that toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China.

Since the question asks which locations had *developed/advanced* sewage systems, and Harappa and Santorini are the only options mentioned in the passage in that specific context, we need to select from those.

From the given options:

*   **A: Harappawa:** The passage explicitly mentions Harappa had advanced drainage systems with flush toilets.
*   **B: Santorini:** The passage mentions ruins of sewage systems were found there.
*   **C: Egypthuwe:** The passage mentions toilets were present in ancient Egypt, but doesn't specify the level of development.
*   **D: Chinaya:** The passage mentions toilets were present in ancient China, but doesn't specify the level of development.

Between Harappa and Santorini, the passage implies Harappa had a more developed system (""jalayen sodaa harina vaesikili paddhatiyak"" - ""flush toilet system"").

Therefore, the best answer is **A: Harappawa**

kaalaya gevi yaama nireekshanaya kirima sandaha chak‍reeya siduvimak gaena sandahan kala yuththe kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: punarawarthanaya** (repetition).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Chakreeya siduweemaka punaraavartanaya niriksanaya kireema magin obata oba visinma kaalaya gathavima salakunu karagata haekiya."" (By observing the repetition of a cyclical event, you can mark the passage of time yourself.)
* The passage also states: ""punaaravarti siduweemak yanu nithipata naewatha naevatat siduvana yam deyaki."" (A repetitive event is something that constantly happens again and again.)

The core idea is that the *repetition* of a cyclical event is what allows us to observe and measure the passage of time.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Svadesiya kathikayinge sankhyaava vadaat sameepawa adaala vana samaana upabhaasha gananaya karanne da naethi da yanna padanamwa venas we."" This directly translates to: ""Estimates vary depending on whether or not closely related dialects are counted along with the number of native speakers.""
*   This clearly indicates that the fluctuation in the number of native Hindi speakers depends on whether or not very similar dialects are counted.
*   The other options are not the main reason for the number of speakers to vary."

This translates to: ""That Hangul alphabet was originally named Hunmin Jeongeum. Its meaning is """"correct sounds for the instruction of the people"""".""

The question asks: ""Hunmin Jeongeum alphabet was changed in the end for what purpose?""

The passage doesn't say *why* it was changed, only that its original name was Hunmin Jeongeum and it became Hangul.  However, the passage heavily focuses on Hangul and its origins with King Sejong. While it doesn't explicitly state that it was changed to Hangul, this is strongly implied.

Therefore, the best answer from the choices provided is **B: haengeyal (Hangul)**, as it's the name the alphabet is currently known by and the subject of the passage.

"mema chedayata anuwa, chandrayaage mathupita niwaerediwa wisthara karanne pahatha sandahan p‍rakaashayangen kawareda?","Let's break down the information from the passage and the answer options:

**Translation of Passage P (roughly):**

""The Moon's surface composition varies across its near and far sides. The Moon's outer layer is a hardened shell. Its crust consists of a denser near side of about 70km and a less dense far side of about 100km.  It is believed that the surface is thin under the lower-lying areas and thick under the elevated areas.  Because the surface is thinner, it is easier for the near side to form tidal bulges.  It would be easier for lava flows to reach the surface.""

**Translation of Question Q:**

""According to this passage, which of the following statements accurately describes the Moon's surface?""

**Analysis of the answer options:**

*   **A: aasanna paeththata wada ghana prushtayak aetha (Has a denser crust than the near side)** - **INCORRECT.** The passage states the *near* side is denser (70km vs 100km on the far side).

*   **B: usbim walata pahalin aethi prushtaya thunee we (The surface is thinner under the elevated areas)** - **INCORRECT.** The passage says the surface is THICKER under the elevated areas (us bim).

*   **C: aetha paeththe adu udam raela aethi wiya haeka (The far side can have less tidal bulge)** - **CORRECT.**  The passage states that the thinner crust on the near side makes it easier to form tidal bulges, implying the far side would have smaller ones.

*   **D: usbim walata pahalin udam raela adu wiya haekiya (There can be less tidal bulge under the highlands)** - **INCORRECT.** The passage links tidal bulges to the *thinness* of the crust, not directly to highlands.  Highlands have thicker crust, so tidal bulges would be harder to form *there*.

**Therefore, the correct answer is C.**
"

This translates to: ""Its surface is approximately 70km thick in the near side and 100km thick in the far side. It is thinner beneath the flat areas, whereas it is thicker beneath the high ground.""

Therefore, the answer is **C: usbim walata pahalin (beneath the high ground)**. The text explicitly states the surface is thicker under high ground.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, samahara aya wishvasa karanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: wenath grahaloka wala jiwaya pawathiyi** (There is life on other planets).

The passage states that some people ""visvaasa karati"" (believe) in the existence of aliens or other life forms on other planets. This directly aligns with option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: pudgalayin wenath tharu walata gaman kara aetha** (People have traveled to other stars) - The passage explicitly states this is a distant dream and unlikely to happen soon.
*   **B: pudgalayinta wenath lokayan gaweshanaya kirime haekiyaawak naetha** (People do not have the ability to explore other worlds) - The passage discusses the *dream* of exploring other worlds, implying at least a theoretical possibility, though it's far off.
*   **D: tharakaa athara dura saethapum triliyanayakata wada aduya** (The distance between stars is less than a septillion trillion) - The passage clearly states the distance *is* septillions of trillions.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Jeremiah Horrocks observed a **Venus transit** in 1639.
*   The passage also mentions that Galileo's observations of Venus' phases provided support for the Copernican theory (heliocentrism - planets orbit the Sun). Venus' transit is a consequence of its orbit and position relative to the Earth and Sun, further solidifying this heliocentric view."

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that in 1610, Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe the phases of Venus, similar to the phases of the Moon.
*   The other options are incorrect based on the passage:
    *   A: While the passage mentions phases are related to exposure to the sun, it's specifically about Venus, not the Moon.
    *   C: The passage mentions that Venus' phases supported the heliocentric theory, but Galileo's observation was the phases themselves, not the movement of planets around the sun.
    *   D: The passage states that Jeremiah Horrocks observed the transit of Venus in 1639, *after* Galileo's observations."

"mema chedayata anuwa, wilayanaya tharakaawalata kirimata ida denne kumak sandaha da?","Based on the passage (P), the closest answer is **C: aalokaya ha ushnathwaya labaa deema (generating light and heat)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the fusion of heavier hydrogen isotopes releases energy in the form of light (tharaka aalokaya) and heat (ushnathwaya). This is the primary outcome of the fusion reaction.

The other options are not the direct reason why fusion occurs:

*   **A: wadath bara sanghataka thaeneema (creating heavier components):** This is a result of fusion, not the reason it's allowed to happen.
*   **B: wilayana p‍rathikriyaakaaraka thaeneema (creating fusion reactants):** This is a requirement *for* fusion to happen, but not the reason it happens.
*   **D: hayidrajan paramanu thaeneema (creating hydrogen atoms):** Fusion consumes hydrogen atoms, it doesn't create them.

"
pahatha sandahan dewalin p‍rayojanawath wilayana p‍rathikriyaakaarakayak nirmanaya karanne kumakda?,"Let's break down the information provided in passage P.

Passage P describes a nuclear fusion reaction (the ""vadaat bara sanghataka thaenimata hydrajan paramanu bedima"" part indicates hydrogen atoms being fused together) that produces energy, light, and heat, similar to what happens in stars. It mentions that scientists are working on creating a reaction that can produce energy in a controlled manner. However, they also acknowledge that this is a difficult problem and it could take years to develop a practical solution.

The question in Q asks: ""What is used to create a practical fusion reactor (prayojanawath wilayana prathikriyaakaarakayak nirmanaya karanne kumakda)?""

Looking at the given options:

*   **A: Hydrogen (hayidrajan)** - Hydrogen is the fuel for fusion reactions.
*   **B: Stars (tharu)** - Stars are where fusion naturally occurs.
*   **C: Atoms (paramanu)** - Atoms are the building blocks of matter, including hydrogen.
*   **D: Energy (balashakthiya)** - Energy is the *result* of the fusion reaction, not what you use to create the reactor.

The correct answer is **A: Hydrogen (hayidrajan)**, because hydrogen is the element used as the fuel in the nuclear fusion reaction that the passage describes as the basis for the desired reactor. Although atoms are technically used, hydrogen is more specific and accurate in this context.
"
jalaye rasayanika sanyuthiya kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: hayidrajan paramanu dekak ha oksijan paramanuwak**

The passage states: ""sanyukta jalaya haiderajan paramaanu dekakin saha ek oxygen paramaanuvakin saedee aetha."" which translates to ""Water is made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.""
"

This translates to: ""Whether it is a gas, liquid or solid, it has the same molecular structure. Its physical state may change, but its chemical state remains the same.""

The question is: ""When water changes its state, what remains the same?""

The answer is the ""anuka wyuhaya"" (molecular structure).

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: anuka wyuhaya**.
"
"chedayata anuwa, aethaem neethi paenavimata uthsaha kirimedee p‍rantha dahathuna sandaha pahatha sandahan karunuwalin gaetaluwak nowuye kumakda?","The passage states that the Congress lacked the power to collect taxes, enforce laws effectively (often facing non-cooperation from states), and regulate interstate commerce or tariffs. Furthermore, amending the constitution required unanimous consent from all states, which was difficult to achieve as states often didn't send representatives, indicating a lack of support for the central government.

Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: jaathika baladhaareenge daedi adheekshanaya (Strong oversight from national authorities):** The passage explicitly mentions the lack of enforcement power by the central government, contradicting this option.
*   **B: kongrasaya thula balaya nomaethikama (Lack of power within Congress):** The passage details Congress's inability to collect taxes, enforce laws, and regulate commerce. So, this option does seem like a potential problem.
*   **C: ekamathika anumaethiya awashya sanshodhana (Amendments requiring unanimous consent):** The passage states that unanimous consent was required for amendments, making it difficult to change the constitution and likely contributed to issues.
*   **D: nopawathina jaathika widhaayakayak (A non-existent national executive):** The passage mentions the lack of enforcement power which would be a function of a executive branch. The passage doesn't imply that this was not the case.

Given the information, the correct answer is **D: nopawathina jaathika widhaayakayak (A non-existent national executive)**.

**Explanation:**

Although the congress lacked a national executive to fully enforce the law, the problem was that they didn't provide help even when the congress tried to enact laws. The congress couldn't collect taxes from the states, or force the states to comply. If the congress didn't even have power, then the executive being there or not doesn't affect the fact that state cooperation was not provided.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that state representatives often didn't even show up to Congress, indicating a lack of enthusiasm for supporting the central government. This is directly related to a lack of representation or influence in the central government.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: badu balathmaka karanu laebuwe kongrasaya ha p‍rantha baladhaareen wisinya:** The passage clearly states Congress had *no* power to levy taxes.
*   **B: vyavasthaawa sanshodhanaya kirima kongrasaye adhikaariya matha randa pawathee:** The passage states amending the Articles required unanimous consent from all states, not just Congress's authority.
*   **D: madhyama rajaya p‍radhaana kotas dekakin samanwitatha wiya:** The passage focuses on the weakness and ineffectiveness of the central government, not its structure. The text doesn't describe it as being made up of two clear components."

The passage states: ""1981 dee, demuhun okid vargayak wana vaenda miss jokim, deshayehi jaathika pushpaya lesa tora ganna ladi,"" which translates to ""In 1981, the *Vanda Miss Joaquim*, which is a type of orchid, was chosen as the national flower of the country.""  Therefore, *Vanda Miss Joaquim* is a flower.

"mema chedayata anuwa, geesa piramidawala kumana gunathmakabhawayata nawa rajadhaaniye egypthuwerun mawitha kala nohaeki vi da?","The passage states that while the New Kingdom Egyptians fought wars over and destroyed the monuments of their ancestors that were thousands of years old, they *never* surpassed the *grandeur* and *technical skill* of the construction of the pyramids.

The question asks what quality of the Giza pyramids the New Kingdom Egyptians could *not* surpass.

*   **A: ewage wayasa (Their age):** The passage doesn't specifically say they couldn't surpass the age, although the pyramids were already thousands of years old. This is not the primary focus.
*   **B: gal bhawithaya (Use of stone):** The passage doesn't mention the use of stone as a limiting factor.
*   **C: ewage wishalathwaya (Their grandeur/size):** The passage directly mentions that they could never surpass the pyramids' *grandeur*. This is a key factor.
*   **D: ewaye idikirim (Their construction):** The passage also directly mentions the *technical skill* of the construction. This is a key factor.

Since the passage focuses on the *grandeur* and *technical skill* of the pyramids, the closest correct answer would be the combined element of size and construction.

Therefore, **C: ewage wishalathwaya (Their grandeur/size)** is the better answer as it encompasses a major quality mentioned. While D (construction) is also relevant, size/grandeur is a more overarching factor.

**Final Answer: C**

    *   C: There was a Keralan population there (Completely irrelevant)
    *   D: Discovery of prisoner abuse (This aligns perfectly with the passage).

**Therefore, the prison became infamous because of the discovery/revelation of prisoner abuse.**"

reeding reyinbo hi saema kathaangayakma daruwanta labaa dun nirdesha monava sandaha da?,"The correct answer is **B: desheeya pusthakaala**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Saema vaedasatahanakma, daruvan ovunge pusthakaalayata giya vita ovun seviya yuthu poth pilibandava nirdesha labaa dei.""  This translates to: ""Every reading lesson, when children go to their library, gives suggestions about the books they should search for."" Thus reeding reyinbo hi saema kathaangayakma daruwanta labaa dun nirdesha is about their library.
"

Here's why:

* **P** states that officials in Amsterdam, speaking about the Anne Frank museum, say that a tree is infected with a fungus and poses a health risk to the public. They were planning to cut it down, but recent orders prevented it. This implies the officials believe it *needs* to be cut down.

Let's look at the other options:

* **B: eya sanrakshanaya kala yuthuya** (It should be protected): This is the *opposite* of what the officials initially wanted.
* **C: eya pus wargayakin aasadhanaya vi aetha** (It is infected with a fungus): This is a *fact* presented by the officials, not an argument.
* **D: eya mahajana sawukyayata tharjanayaki** (It is a threat to public health): This is another *fact* presented by the officials, an explanation for why they wanted to cut it down.

*   **Q:** ""ohuge kathawa atharathura, steev jobs aepal naewatha soyaa gaeneemata yana bawa paewasuwe kumakda?"" (translates to: ""In his speech, what did Steve Jobs say Apple was going to reinvent?"")

The text says Apple is going to reinvent the ""durakathanaya"" (telephone).

Therefore, the answer is **B: durakathanaya (telephone)**."
steev jobsge paeya dekaka kathawe aramuna wuye kumakda?,"Let's break down the passage:

The passage mentions ""Aepal pradhaana vidhaayaka niladhaari stew jobs"" (Apple CEO Steve Jobs), ""mema upakaranaya elidaekvuye vedikavata naegee aifonaya"" (introduced the iPhone to the stage), and ""ada aepal visin durakathanaya naewatha soyagenimatayi soodaanam wanne, api ada ithihasaya nirmaanaya kirimatayi yanne"" (today Apple is preparing to reinvent the phone, we are going to create history).

This clearly indicates the speech was about a **new phone**.

"
big b‍radar sambandhayen ACMA hi soyaagaeneem monavada?,"Based on the provided text, the answer is **C: varana neethi ullanghanaya kara aetha**.

Here's why:

Since P states it found no violation, and Q asks what ACMA found regarding Big Brother, the implication (while slightly convoluted due to double negatives) is that ACMA determined there *wasn't* a violation.  However, looking closer at the translation, it actually says that ""ACMA found that Big Brother did *not* violate the content classification policy,"".  So the correct answer is C.

Let me know if you'd like me to explain any of the other options!

This translates to: ""As the Australian Treasurer and potentially the successor to Liberal Party leader John Howard, Pieter Costello...""

Therefore, John Howard is the Liberal Party leader mentioned in the context of Costello being his possible successor. However, the question asks who the leader of the Liberal Party *is* according to the passage. While Howard is the leader, the answer is the person Costello is *potentially* succeeding.

The passage says Pieter Costello was a possible successor to John Howard, implying John Howard was the leader at the time. But the question asks specifically who the leader *is*. The passage introduces John Howard as the leader. Therefore, the best answer is:

B: jon hovad
"

**D: itha mila adhika vima (itha arthikamaya washayen haekiyaavak aethi woo vita ostreliyava eya digata ma bhavitha kala yuthu bhava kostelo mahatha paewaseeya.)**

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes that Costello supports nuclear power *if* it is economically viable. This implies that currently, its high cost is a barrier. The relevant quote is: *""Aarthikamaya washayen nyashtika balashakthi uthpadanaye haekiyaavak aethi woo vita ostreliyava eya digata ma bhavitha kala yuthu bhava kostelo mahatha paewaseeya.""* which translates to ""*Costello said that Australia should consider nuclear power if it is economically viable.""*

While the other options *could* be factors in a broader discussion about nuclear power in Australia, the text *specifically* highlights the economic aspect as a key consideration."

Translation (roughly):  ""The trial was held in the Birmingham Crown Court and the final verdict was given on August 3rd. At that location, the defendant who was taken into custody rejected the assault, and stated that he used a shield to protect himself from the bottle attack launched by about thirty people. Blake was also charged with attempting to disrupt the court proceedings. The judge told Blake that his imprisonment would be a """"unique novel hack"""".""

Now let's look at the options:

*   **A: ohu ema sthaanayedeema ath adanguwata gena thibe**  (He was taken into custody at that location) - **TRUE**.  The text says ""...Ema sthaanayedi ath adanguvata path woo idiripath karannaa...""

*   **C: ohu paharadeeme dee pollak bhawitha kaleya** (He used a pole during the assault) - **NOT MENTIONED**.  The text doesn't say anything about him using a pole; it mentions he used a shield.
*   **D: bothal thama wetha wisikaranu laebu bawa ohu kiyaa sitiyeya** (He said bottles were thrown at him) - **TRUE**. The text says ""...ohuta ella kala bothal prahaarayen aaraksha weemata rita bhaavithaa kala bhava prakaasha kale ya."" (He stated that he used a shield to protect himself from the bottle attack).

Therefore, the statement that is *not* true is **B: ohu paharadeema piligaththeya**.  He denied the assault.

So the answer is **B**.

"mema chedayata anuwa, blekta sidu nowuye pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","Let's break down the provided text (P) and the question (Q) to determine the correct answer.

*   **P Summary:**
    *   An event took place at the Birmingham political authority, with a final decision due on August 3rd.
    *   Someone was taken into custody.
    *   This person refused to plead guilty and approximately 30 individuals protected them from a bottle attack using shields.
    *   Blake was accused of attempting to disrupt the court proceedings.
    *   The judge told Blake that being sent to prison would be a ""huge shock"".

*   **Q:** According to this passage, which of the following did *not* happen to Blake?

Now let's analyze the options:

*   **A: adhikarana kriyaawaliya mulaa kirimata uthsaha kirima sambandhayen ohu vaeradikaru wiya** - This translates to: ""He was accused of attempting to disrupt the court proceedings.""  The passage *does* state that Blake was accused of this.

*   **B: ohu ath adanguwata ganna ladee** - This translates to: ""He was taken into custody."" The passage states that someone was taken into custody, but it doesn't explicitly say that Blake was the one taken into custody.

*   **C: ohuta pollakin pahara dena ladee** - This translates to: ""He was beaten with a stick."" The passage describes a bottle attack that was defended against with shields, not a stick attack.

*   **D: ohuta ohu sirayata yawanu aethi bawa pawasanu laebeeya** - This translates to: ""He was told he would be sent to prison."" The judge told Blake that going to prison would be a ""huge shock.""

The correct answer is **C** and **B**. While someone was taken into custody, we don't know that Blake was the one taken into custody, and he certainly was not attacked with a stick."
eksath jaatheenge goleeya unusum vimen balapaemata lakwana ratawalata udaw kirima sandaha wu aramudala bhawitha nokaranne kumak sandahada?,"The passage P mentions the fund will be used for:

*   **Ganwathurata oroththu dena nivaasa (Flood-resistant housing)**
*   **Vadaa yahapath jala kalamanaakaranaya (Better water management)**
*   **Boga vividhaangikaranaya (Crop diversification)**
*   **Sanvardhanaya wana ratawalata thaaksanayan bedaadima aethulat we.(Sharing technology with developing countries)**

The question asks what the UN fund *would not* be used for.  Looking at the provided options, the correct answer is:

*   **D: goleeya ushnathwaya ihala yaamen aethiwana balapaem samanaya kirima (Compensating for the impacts of global warming)**

Although the passage mentions the UN fund will give aid to countries facing the effects of global warming, it will be spent on building up their infrastructure, not compensating global warming itself.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D**."
"mema chedayata anuwa, eksath janapadaya aarakshaa kirimata balaporoththu wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: ithiriwa aethi vaesi wananthara**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Baali hi nyaaya pathraye thibunu anek visayanta lowa ithiri wanaanthara beraa gaeneema..."" which translates to: ""Bali is one of the subjects in the path of justice to save the remaining forests in the world...""

Therefore, saving the remaining forests is mentioned in the passage. The other options are not directly mentioned in the context of what the United Nations is expected to achieve.

aelbat muchanga wisin thawamath ekaga wiya yuthu deyak lesa sandahan nokarana ladde pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: benin AfCTA hi sahabhagee wanne da yana bawa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Benin da sahabhaagi wana bhava AU hi velenda saha karmaantha komasaris albert muchangaa daenum dunneya."" This means Albert Muchanga announced Benin's participation in AfCFTA. There is no question about it, it's a stated fact.

*   The passage mentions ""Apa thawamath uthpaadana nithi saha badhu sahana pilibandava ekaghathaawakata paemina nomaethi vuvat."" This translates to ""Although we have not yet reached an agreement on origin rules and tariff concessions."" This shows rules of origin (C) and tariff concessions (D) are still to be agreed upon

*   The passage says ""...2020, juuli 1 dina sita velandaama aarambha kireema sandahaa apata aethi raamuva pramanavath wana baev komasaarisvaraya paewaseeya."" This translates to ""...the commissioner said that we have enough framework to start trading from July 1, 2020."". This is an indication of the date trading can start (B).

Therefore, the only option that Albert Muchanga *doesn't* suggest needs to be agreed upon is Benin's participation."
"mema chedayata anuwa, juli masayedee welandama aarambha kala haekke aeyi?","The correct answer is **C: eya AU welanda ha karmantha komasaris wisin anumatha karana ladee**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the AU Trade and Industry Commissioner, Albert Muchanga, announced that Nigeria plans to join AfCFTA in the coming weeks and that Benin will also participate. The commissioner stated that even though production rules and tax concessions haven't been agreed upon, there's a sufficient framework to start trading from July 1, 2020.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: juli masaye aarambhaka dinaya naijiriyaawa AfCFTA ha sambandha vima sandaha wu kondesi wala kotasak wiya** This isn't stated. The July start date is despite the lack of finalized rules and concessions.
*   **B: p‍ramanawath neethi ramuwak saha sahana kriyaathmaka we** The passage states they *haven't* reached an agreement on production rules and tax concessions. However, there's a ""sufficient framework"" (ramuwak) to begin trading.
*   **D: mularambhaka neethi saha badu sahana pilibandawa ekagathawayakata paemina aetha** The passage says they *haven't* reached an agreement on preliminary rules and tax concessions.

Only option C correctly reflects that the commencement of trade from July 1st has the approval of the AU Trade and Industry Commissioner."
"mema chedayata anuwa, aetlanta jarnal-kanstitiyshan wisin adhyaapana niladhaareenta kala chodnawa kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: anawaranaya karagath abhyanthara gaetalu sambandhayen kisidu kriyaamargayak nogaeneema**

Let's break down why:

* **The passage states:** ""...parikshana pratiphalayanhi gaetalu penwana vaartavak prakaashayata path karana ladi... paasala abyantarava gaetalu handunaagath namuth eva sambandhayen kriyaa nokala bawath ya.""  This directly translates to: ""...published a news report highlighting the issues in the exam results...internal issues within the school were identified, but no action was taken regarding them.""

Now let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: jarnal-kanstitiyshan vaarthawa wikurthi kirima (Distorting the news report of the Journal-Constitution)**  The passage doesn't accuse the educators of distorting a news report. Instead, the news report *exposed* their wrongdoing.
* **B: nagarika adhyaapanaya nawyakaranaya kirimata apohosath vima (Failing to innovate civic education)** The passage doesn't mention anything about the innovation of civic education. It focuses on issues with exam results.
* **D: adu pareekshana lakunu vaartha kirima (Reporting low test scores)** The core of the allegation is *not* about reporting low scores. It's about *manipulating* or cheating to get artificially *high* scores.

Therefore, option **C** is the only one that accurately reflects the accusation made by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution according to the passage: the failure to act on internal problems they were aware of.
"
"mema chedaye sandahan thorathuru walata anuwa, aetlanta jarnal-kanstitiyshan vaarthawe sandahan nowanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: 2013 jaathika pareekshaawariya sammanaya (2013 National Test Award)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage mentions:**
    * Unusually high test scores (""asaaman‍ya lesa pareekshana lakunu ihala yaama"").
    * Evidence of test cheating revealed by a witness (""pareekshana path‍rikaa magadiyak vi aethi bawata saak‍shi"") and involving many teachers.
    * Plans for civil education and reforms (""naagarika adhyaapanaya nawyakaranaya kirima sandaha yojana"").

* **The passage does NOT mention the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporting specifically about:**
   *  It mentions the 2009 National Tester award. The 2013 accusation came later from witness testimonies.

Therefore, option C is the information *not* mentioned in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution report, according to the text."
mema chedayata anuwa bomba p‍raharayen pasuwa daenagatha haeki wu thorathuru monavada?,"Based on the provided text (P), here's an analysis of the options:

*   **A: thuvala laebu ayage awasan sankyaawa (The final number of injured people)** - The passage explicitly states that the real number of injured is still unknown (""saebae samkhyaava thawamath nodani""). Thus, this is incorrect.

*   **B: bomba pupura giye kumana godanaegili asala da yana bawa (Which building did the bombs explode near?)** - The passage mentions that the first bomb exploded near the Agraandukaaravarayaage kaaryaalayen. Also, three more bombs exploded near government buildings (""rajaye godanaegili asala""). Thus, this is a detail we can know.

*   **C: thawath amathara bomba pupurava haereemata thibeda yana bawa (Whether there are more additional bombs to explode)** - The passage does not indicate about plans for additional bombs.

*   **D: nila marana sankyaawa (The official death toll)** - The passage indicates an official death toll of 8 people (""nila washayen miyagiya samkhyaava atak lesa daekvena"").

Therefore, the correct answers are **B** and **D**."
2017 dee manchester city kandayamata ek vimen pasuwa jesus tharaga keeyak kreeda kara thibe da?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **D: 53**.

The text states: ""Ethaen sita, brasiliyanu kandaayama siyaluma tharaga valadi samaajaya venuven tharaga 53 kata sahabhaagi wee aethi athara gola 24 k res karagena atha.""

This translates to: ""Since then, the Brazilian player has participated in 53 matches for the Manchester City team, scoring 24 goals.""
"
kumana kreeda samajayata ek vima sandaha pavum miliyana 27 ka gasthuwak jesusta laebuneda?,"Based on the passage, Jesus joined Manchester City in January 2017 for a fee of 27 million.

"
nevasikaagara amuththan gaena sath‍ya nowana p‍rakaashaya wanne kawaredaa?,"Let's analyze the original passage (P) and the statements (A, B, C, D):

*   **P:** At approximately 10 AM today, a residential building in Mecca, the holy city of Islam, collapsed. A number of pilgrims who came to the holy city for the Hajj pilgrimage were staying in this building. Most of the residents were citizens of the United Arab Emirates. The expected death toll is 15.

Now, let's evaluate each statement:

*   **A: amuththan makkaawe wandna gamanak sandaha paemina sitiyaha** -  The passage says that pilgrims *were* staying in the building. It mentions pilgrims coming to Mecca for Hajj.  Therefore, they are probably there for the pilgrimage. This statement could be true.
*   **B: samahara amuththo desheeya puravaesiyan nowuha** - The passage says most of the residents were citizens of the UAE (United Arab Emirates). This explicitly states that most were *not* domestic citizens. Therefore, this statement is likely true.
*   **C: haj dinata pera sawasa amuththan ehi sitiyaha** - The building collapsed in the morning. The passage mentioned that pilgrims were staying in the building. The fact that it collapsed implies people were there. Thus, they were present the evening before. This statement can be true
*   **D: amuththangen bahutharaya shuddha nagaraye sita paemini ayayi** - The passage states that *most* of the residents were citizens of the UAE, not of Mecca (the holy city). Therefore, it is wrong to assume that most residents came from the holy city. This is the false statement.

**Therefore, the answer is D.**
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, pahatha sandahan p‍rakaashawalin niwaeredi wanne kumakda?","Based on the provided passage, the correct answer is **B: siyaluma amuththan eksath arabi emeer rajyaye sita paemini ayayi** (all the visitors were from the United Arab Emirates).

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Nevaasikaagaraye amuththan boho durata eksath arabi emir rajyaye puravaesiyan vuha."" This translates to ""Most of the visitors in the residence were citizens of the United Arab Emirates."" Therefore, saying ALL were from UAE would be accurate within the context of the provided details.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: kisiweku miya giye naetha** (no one died): The passage indicates an expected death toll of 15.
*   **C: haj wandna gamanata pera sawasa amuththan ehi sitiyaha** (visitors were there the evening before the hajj pilgrimage): This is not explicitly stated in the text. We only know they were residing there.
*   **D: amuththangen bahutharaya makkaa p‍radeshavaseen wiya** (most of the visitors were residents of Mecca): The passage states that most of the visitors were from the UAE, contradicting this option."
"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, gaeteema pilibanda awinishchitha nowana thorathuru kawaredaa?","Based on the provided text, the only piece of information that is NOT uncertain about the collision is **B: gaeteeme sthaanaya (the location of the collision).**

Here's why:

*   **The text states:** ""chandrikaa dekama pruthuwiye sita saethapum 491 kata udadee ekineka haa gaetini."" Which directly translates to ""The two satellites collided 491 miles above the Earth."" This is a specific location, not an uncertainty.

The other options are all described as uncertain:

*   **A: gaeteeme wishalathwaya (the magnitude of the collision)** - The text mentions that scientists are still trying to determine the magnitude of the collision.
*   **C: pruthiwiya matha ema gaeteeme balapaema (the impact of the collision on Earth)** - The text says that scientists are still trying to determine the impact on Earth.
*   **D: sunbun wala pihiteema (the location of the debris)** - The text says the US Department of Defense is searching for the location of the debris.

Therefore, the correct answer is B."
"mema chedayata anuwa, mema gaeteema sambandhayen thawamath theeranaya kala yuthu de wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **D: binda vaeteeme nishchitha parimanaya** (the exact size of the explosion).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Ema gaetume vishaalatvaya saha emagin pruthuwiyata vanu aethi balapaema kumakda yanna thiranaya kirimata ovuhu thawamath uthsaha darathi."" This translates to ""They are still trying to determine the size of the collision and its impact on Earth.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: sunbun luhubaendeema palanaya karanne kawuda (Who controls the debris tracking?)**: While the US military is involved in finding debris, the *specific question* they're still trying to answer is about the explosion's magnitude and Earth's impact.
*   **B: gaetena awasthaawe dee chandrikaa ketharam wegayen gaman karamin sitiyeda (How fast were the satellites traveling at the time of the collision?)**: The passage *already provides* the speed of the satellites (17,500 km per hour).
*   **C: wishleshanaye p‍rathiphala beda ganna aakaaraya (How to share the analysis results?)**: The passage mentions the results will be published, not *how* to share them.

Therefore, only option D accurately reflects what is still under investigation according to the given text."

The passage describes a law signed by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger that prohibits the sale or rental of violent video games to minors in California.  Options B, C, and D are incorrect or not the *main* component of what Arnold Schwarzenegger did. While there's a penalty (B), the core is the ban itself.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, kiyanu labana dewal maga haeriye kawuda?","The passage states that Miller said he couldn't hear what Mike Bohose said. Therefore, the answer is **C: Milar**.

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""mama soodaanam vemin city baevin ohu pavasamin city deya mata aeththatama aesune naetha."" (He was preparing to speak, but he didn't clearly hear the things being said in court)

This translates to him not paying full attention because he was preparing to speak in the court. So that matches option B.

It then says, ""agamaeti samaga pawathi hamuvakadi, letan kansarvetivvarunge parisara panath ketumpathata venaskam illaa sitiye, kansarvetiv pakshaye parisara panath ketumpata """"""""nawatha sampurnayen """""""" liyanu lesa illimeni."" This means, ""At a meeting with the Prime Minister, Layton asked for changes to the Conservative's environmental bill, requesting that the Conservative Party's environmental bill be written """"""""completely new.""""""""""

Therefore, **C: jaek leyton** is the correct answer.

"
adhoraktha warnawaleekshanaya bhawitha karamin paryeshakayan nireekshanaya kale kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: surathal sathwa muth‍rawala sphatika sanyuthiya**

*   The passage states: ""Adhorakta varnaavaliksanaya (FTIR) mangin sansandanaya kala vita daknata labune mema sphatikavala samyutiya balapaemata lakvu surathal sathunge muthravalin hamu woo sphatikavalata samaana bavay."" This translates to: ""When the infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was carefully compared, it was found that the composition of these crystals was similar to the crystals found in the urine of affected pets.""

Therefore, using infrared spectroscopy (adhoraktha warnawaleekshanaya), the researchers observed the composition (sanyutiya) of crystals (sphatika) in the urine (muthrawala) of pets (surathal sathwa).

luna “athbhootha” lesa haendinwuye kawuda?,"Based on the text provided, both **B: Dustin Runnels** and **D: Tommy Dreamer** describe Luna as ""wonderful"" or ""unique"" in some way.

*   Dustin Runnels uses the word ""atbhutay"" which translates to ""wonderful"" or ""amazing"".
*   Tommy Dreamer says she was ""athyantha raejina"" which implies something extraordinary and unique.

The question uses ""athbhootha"" which is similar to the word Dustin Runnels uses. However, without more context, it is hard to say definitively whether Dustin Runnels is the better answer.

Rajaye wimarshakayan and aeyage rasikayin were not mentioned.

The best answer is **B: Dustin Runnels** because his description directly translated to ""wonderful"" or ""amazing"", and is the closer to the word ""athbhootha"" used in the question.

anathurata sambandha riyaduruta sidu nowuye kumakda?,"Let's break down the paragraph (P) and the question (Q) to find the answer.

*   **Paragraph (P) Summary:** A car crashed into a house. No one inside the house was hurt, but the driver was seriously injured in the head. Emergency services rescued the driver from the car, and the road was temporarily closed. He was first taken to Great Yarmouth's James Paget Hospital and then transferred to Cambridge's Addenbrooke's Hospital.

*   **Question (Q):** What *did not* happen to the driver involved in the accident?

Now let's analyze the options:

*   **A: ohuge hisata thuvala sidu wiya (His head was injured):**  The paragraph clearly states the driver had a serious head injury. This *did* happen, so it's not the answer.

*   **B: ohu niwasa thula siti kisiwekuta thuvala sidu kale naetha (He did not injure anyone inside the house):** The paragraph says no one inside the house was hurt. So he did not injure anyone inside the house.

*   **C: ohu kembrig hi rohalaka sita gret yaamawuthhi rohalakata maru karanu laebeeya (He was transferred from a hospital in Cambridge to a hospital in Great Yarmouth):** The paragraph says he was FIRST taken to Great Yarmouth (James Paget) and THEN transferred to Cambridge (Addenbrooke's). This is the opposite of what the option says. Therefore, this *did not* happen.

*   **D: hadisi anathuru anshaya ohuwa vahanayen iwath kirimata udaw kaleya (The emergency services helped him get out of the vehicle):** The paragraph explicitly says emergency services rescued the driver from the car. This *did* happen, so it's not the answer.

**Therefore, the correct answer is C.**"
ragbi shoorathawaliye dee dakunu ap‍rikaawe kreedawe kaepee penena kaaranaya wuye kumakda?,"Based on the provided text, the reasons for South Africa's impressive performance in the rugby championship are:

*   **D: aarak‍shaka kusalatha (Defensive Skills)** - The text mentions ""Ovunge shikshaakami aarakshaka vidhi"" (Their disciplined defensive methods).
*   **B: bola haesiravime haekiyaawa (Ball handling ability)** - The text states ""bola kalamanaakaranayehi nipunathaa"" (Skill in ball management).
*   **A: kandayamak lesa chamathkaareewa katayuthu kirima (Working brilliantly as a team)** - The text mentions ""athidaksha kandaayam ekaghathaawa"" (Highly skilled team unity).

While C might seem plausible initially, the passage doesn't explicitly highlight a ""brilliant start to the championship"" as the key reason for their overall performance.

Considering the options, the **most accurate and comprehensive answer is D and B and A** as the passage mentioned all three as reasons for their success. I think the best answer is, therefore, a combination of the three."
"mema chedayata anuwa, dakunu ap‍rikaawe tharagaya vaedi diyunu vimata patan gaththe kawadadaa?","The correct answer is **D: tharagawaliya idiriyata yathma**.

*   **A: p‍rathisanskarana sidu kirimen pasuwa chinaye aarthikaya sheegrayen wardhanaya vi thibe** (After reforms, China's economy has grown rapidly) - This is directly supported by the text. The text mentions economic reforms under Deng Xiaoping and a 90-fold increase in China's economy.

*   **B: eksath janapadayata wada wishala motar ratha apanayanaya welandapolak chinayata aetha** (China has a larger motor vehicle export market than the United States) - The text says China *surpassed* the United States as the largest *market* for industry, but it says China exported *more vehicles* than Germany. This statement refers to motor vehicle **export market**. This statement is true.

*   **C: chinayata eksath janapadayata wada wishala dala desheeya nishpadithayak labaa gatha haekiya** (China can achieve a larger gross domestic product than the United States) - The text states that China's GDP could be larger than the United States in two decades. That means it *can*, therefore this statement is true.

*   **D: chinaye vahana apanayanaya kisi witekath germaniya ikmava naetha** (China's vehicle exports have never exceeded Germany) - The text explicitly states that China exported more cars than Germany last year. This statement is false.

Therefore, the statement that the passage *does not* reflect is **D**.

**Final Answer: D**"
"mema chedayata anuwa, chinaye dala desheeya nishpadithaya eksath janapadaye dala desheeya nishpadithaya ikmava yaa haekke kawadada?","The correct answer is **B: dashaka dekak thula**

The passage states: ""Dashaka dekakin chinaye dhala deshiya nishpadithaya eksath janapadayata vadaa vishaala weemata ida atha."" which translates to ""Within two decades, China's gross domestic product is likely to be larger than that of the United States.""

The passage states:  ""Hoo sanvardhanaya vemin pawathina ratawalata dirigaenvuye """"palamuwa dushanaya weeme ha pasuwa pirisidu kireeme paerani maavatha maga haerimata"""" ya.""  This directly translates to ""He urged developing countries to 'avoid the old path of polluting first and cleaning up later'.""

The other options are not the primary focus of what he is urging developing nations to do:

*   **A: owunge sanwardhana adiyaren obbata yana wagakeem bhara gaeneema** (Taking responsibility beyond their development stage): While related, this is a consequence of avoiding the pollution path, not the core action urged.
*   **B: aarthika nimaewuma kerehi awadhaanaya yomu kirima** (Focusing attention on economic outcomes): This is mentioned as China's economic output being studied, but not a direct urging to developing nations.
*   **C: owunge warthamana wagakeem walin obbata yaama** (Going beyond their current responsibilities): This is a more general statement, and while related, not the specific action urged regarding pollution."
hoo wisin sandahan nokarana ladde kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: kaaban wimochanaya adu kirima sambandha sankyaathmaka daththa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that he ""nokale ya"" which translates to ""did not"" (referring to a value for the reduction). This means he didn't provide any *numerical data* (sankyaathmaka daththa) related to carbon emission reduction.

Let's break down why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **A: adu kirima sandaha wu padanama (Basis for reduction):** He *mentions* the basis for reduction by aiming to match 2005 levels (""2005 mattamen saelakiya yuthu mattamakata kapaa haerimata""). While he doesn't quantify *how much* reduction, the *basis* is present.
*   **B: dooshanaya sambandhayen sanwardhanaya wemin pawathina ratawalata upades (Advice to developing countries regarding pollution):** He directly *gives advice* to developing countries about avoiding the ""pollute first, clean up later"" path.
*   **C: kaaban wimochanaya adu wana bawata balaporoththu wana dinayak (A date expected for carbon emissions to decrease):** The passage mentions about reducing the carbon dioxide released by the year 2020. It is possible to imply that the date expected for the reduction is 2020.

Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer as he avoided mention of quantifiable reduction data.
"

This translates to: ""Richard Virman, speaking on behalf of Medicines Sans Frontieres, said: """"Angola is going through a terrible collapse there, and the situation in Angola is very serious.""""""

Therefore, Virman said the situation is not improving specifically because of the situation in **Angola**.
"

*   **P (Translation):** ""Kaemil sent his since-seen French opera is related to an artist who lives a life following """"drug and Japanese cravings"""". As a result, while the relevant performers drink cannabis on stage, the audience encourages to join them.""
*   **Q (Translation):** ""Why do the relevant performers encourage the audience during Kaemil's Shanta-Sange opera lecture?""

The passage clearly states that the performers are drinking cannabis on stage and encouraging the audience to join them. Therefore, the answer must be about participating in cannabis use."
opera p‍rasangaya atharathura p‍radhaana washayen kansa dumvaeti panaya karanne kawuda?,"Based on the given text, the answer is **C: p‍rasangika idiripath karannan**.

The text says: ""Pratiphalayak lesa, praasangika idiripath karannan vedikave dee kansa dumwaeti paanaya karana athara ranga shaalava preksakayan eyata sambandhaweema unandu karavayi.""

The passage states that Leonov performed the ""prathama bahira kriyaakarakama (eva), hevat """"abyavakasaye aevidima"""", "" which translates to ""the first extravehicular activity (EVA), or """"walk in space"""".""  ""Abhyawakaasha yaanawen paribahira kriyaakaarakam"" means ""extravehicular activity from a spacecraft."" This is a direct translation and accurate description of what ""abyavakasaye aevidima"" refers to.
"

The text states that the accident involved ""anatura siduweemen pasu, gibsanva rohalakata genagiyamut in mohotakata pasu ohu miya giyeya."" This translates to ""After the accident, Gibson was taken to the hospital, but he died shortly after.""
"
anathurata sambandha pudgalayinta sidu wuye kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: ek pudgalayekuta thuvala sidu nowu athara ek ayeku miya giyeya**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Vayasa avurudu 64 k woo track ratha riyaeduraata mema gaetimen kisindu thuwaalayak sidu novini"" (The 64-year-old track driver did not sustain any injuries from this collision).
*   The passage also states: ""Anatura siduweemen pasu, gibsanva rohalakata genagiyamut in mohotakata pasu ohu miya giyeya"" (After the accident, the victim was taken to the hospital but died shortly after).

Therefore, one person died, and the other was uninjured."

It says the team hopes to find evidence of dark matter interaction between the two galaxies. Also, it says that the Milky Way applies a force on the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy just as Earth exerts a gravitational pull on other objects. Thus, the correct answer is:

*   **D: dhanu mandakiniya saha k‍sheera pathaya** (Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy and the Milky Way)

So the answer is D."
"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, konsarwetiwwarun wisin wiwechanaya nokaranne kumakda?","Based on the provided text (P) and the question (Q), the correct answer is:

**D: naewatha goda naenvima sandaha wu wiyadam**

Here's why:

*   **The context:** The text discusses controversies surrounding the rebuilding efforts after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. It mentions disagreements about overspending on recovery and rebuilding.
*   **The question:** Asks what conservatives would *not* criticize based on the passage.
*   **Analysis of the options:**
    *   **A: sahana wiyadam (excessive spending):** Conservatives would likely criticize excessive spending.
    *   **B: naewatha goda naenvime p‍rayathnaye aduwa (low rebuilding attempts):** Conservatives would prefer to rebuild and may criticize low rebuilding attempts.
    *   **C: yali indikirim konth‍raththu pirinaemenne kaatada (the speed of awarding rebuilding contracts):** The text mentions liberals criticizing awarding rebuilding contracts, but not conservatives, so this could be the right answer if we were searching for something they *would* criticize.
    *   **D: naewatha goda naenvima sandaha wu wiyadam (spending for rebuilding):** The text itself is pointing out that the issue at hand is spending too much, which conservatives would want to support.

Therefore, the option that conservatives are least likely to criticize, based on the text, is the spending to rebuild.

**In short:** Conservatives are unlikely to criticize *spending for rebuilding* itself, as long as they deem the spending to be legitimate. The controversy lies in *overspending*, which is what conservatives would criticize."

This translates to: ""When the capsule enters the Earth's atmosphere, it is expected that a light display will be generated which can be seen in Northern California, Oregon, Nevada, and Utah.""

Therefore, the Stardust spacecraft's light display is expected to be first visible from Northern California.

The answer is **B: uthuru kaelifoniyaawa**
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, abhyawakaasha yaanaya pahatha sandahan kumana karuna sambandhawa vaarthawak thabanu aethi da?","The correct answer is **C: wegawathma pruthiwiyata aapasu yaame gamana (Fastest return to Earth)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""1969 maeyi maasayedi aepalo ex vidhaana modiyulaye vaarthava binda damamin, staardust nawatha pruthuwiyata paemini wegawathma abyaavakasha yaanaya lesa nava sarvakalina vaarthavak pihituvanu atha."" This translates to: ""By breaking the record of the Apollo X command module in May 1969, Stardust set a new universal record as the fastest spacecraft to return to Earth."" This directly supports option C.
The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: ahase wada pululma parasaya aalokamath kirima (Lighting up the widest area in the sky):** While the passage mentions the capsule lighting up the sky over several states, it doesn't explicitly state it's the ""widest area"" ever.
*   **B: boho nagarawala daekiya haeki vima (Being visible in many cities):** The passage mentions areas where it will be visible, but not that it will be visible in many cities.
*   **D: saen fraensiskoo sita los aenjalees dakva wegawathma gaman kirima (Fastest travel from San Francisco to Los Angeles):** While the passage uses the San Francisco to Los Angeles comparison to illustrate the speed, the actual record is for the fastest return to Earth, not just that specific distance."
aachaarya malar balasub‍ramaniyan ge saroja balasub‍ramaniyan hata wu ngaathi sambandhaya kumakda?,"The passage states: ""53 haeviridi sarojaa baalasubramaniyamge dehaya..."" which translates to ""the body of 53-year-old Saroja Balasubramaniam"".  The passage also mentions ""29 haeviridi vaidya malar subramaaniyam"".

Therefore, Saroja Balasubramaniam is most likely the **mother** of Malar Subramaniam. So the correct answer is **C**.
"
sara balasub‍ramaniyange mala sirura soyaagaththe kohenda?,"The correct answer is **C: motar rathaya thula** (inside a car).

The passage states that Saroja Balasubramaniyam's body was found in an Oldsmobile Intrigue vehicle: ""Ehidee ovuhu, le waekunu blankettuvakin aawaranaya kara thibu 53 haeviridi sarojaa baalasubramaniyamge dehaya soyagatha."" This translates to ""There they found the body of 53-year-old Saroja Balasubramaniam, covered in a blood-soaked blanket"". The sentence before mentions the Oldsmobile Intrigue vehicle.

**C: skayip**

The passage states: ""samagama balaaporottu wei. Q: eebe wisin athpathkara gaththe kumakda? (The company hopes... which did eBay acquire?)."" The passage states, ""...wanita skyp valata shakthimath sthaanayak aethi pradeshawala janapriyathaavaya wadi kirimata, samagama balaaporottu wei."" This indicates that eBay is hoping to increase popularity in regions where Skype has a strong position. This implies that eBay acquired Skype to leverage its presence in those regions.
"
ebandu de athpathkara gaeneema haraha eebe balaporoththu wanne kumakda?,"Based on the provided text and the question, the correct answer is **B: nawa p‍radesha walata pulul kirima** (Expanding to new regions).

Here's why:

*   The text mentions that eBay aims to increase popularity in regions like China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil, establishing a strong position in the global market.
*   The question asks what eBay expects by expanding its reach. Expanding to new regions directly aligns with increasing popularity and market presence in new areas.
*   While the other options might be indirect results of expansion, the text primarily emphasizes the goal of **expanding to new regions.**"
"mema chedayata anuwa, satanin pasu midule raendee siti raendawiyan samaga an‍yon‍ya lesa katayuthu nokale kawuda?","The correct answer is **A: maedihathkaruwan**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that medical personnel (maedihathkaruwan) tried to stabilize the situation, implying they interacted with the prisoners.
*   The passage mentions officials (niladhaareen) arriving to subdue the prisoners with tear gas.
*   The passage mentions the fire brigade (gini nivime kandayama) extinguishing the fire.
*   The passage mentions that the transfer of prisoners to the hospital was causing riots.

The question is which of these groups did NOT interact effectively (an‍yon‍ya lesa katayuthu nokale) with the remaining prisoners after the riot started. The passage says the medical personnel tried to stabilize the prisoners, but that their efforts were unclear. All of the other parties involved were doing what they were supposed to do in response to the riot itself.

Therefore, the medical personnel did not interact effectively."
sirakaruwan koolahalawalin pasubaeseemata hethu wuye pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"Based on the text, the correct answer is **B: kadulu vayu** (tear gas).

The passage states that after the prisoners set a fire, ""niladhaarin midulata aetulu wee kandulu vaayuva muktha karamin raendaviyan konakata gonu kalo ya"" which translates to ""officials entered the yard and released tear gas, cornering the prisoners.""  This indicates the tear gas was directly responsible for the prisoners being subdued and brought under control, thereby ending the riot.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: saarthaka sakachcha** (successful discussion): The text states that the mediators' attempts to resolve the situation were unsuccessful.
*   **C: thuvala laebu sesu raendawiyan** (remaining injured prisoners after the riot): While some prisoners might have been injured, the text doesn't indicate this directly caused the end of the riot.
*   **D: ginnak** (fire): The fire was the *cause* of the officials intervening, but the tear gas was the *direct cause* of the riot's end.
"
"aayathulla ali kamenige mathaya anuwa, iranaya ratak lesa nidhas wiya yuththe kumak wethin da?","The correct answer is **D: thel matha yaepeema**.

The passage states that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, before the 1979 Iranian Revolution, described Iran's dependence on oil as a ""shackle"" from which the country should be freed (""tell matha yaepima """"ugulak"""" lesath, ein rata nidahas viya yuthu bawath visthara karana ladhi"").

The other options are mentioned but not as the entity that *recognized* the impact of sanctions in this specific instance:

*   **OPEC:** OPEC is mentioned as reporting on Iran's oil exports declining.
*   **Ayatollah Ali Khamenei:** He is mentioned expressing that Iran should not depend on oil.
*   **European Union:** They are mentioned as imposing sanctions that affect Iran's oil exports."

Here's why:

*   The text clearly states that volunteers count the votes under supervision.
*   The other options are mentioned as part of the process: Transparent ballot boxes, representatives sent by the candidates, and having the voter's roll marked."

The passage states: ""...chanda daayakayin thamanva kutiyaka thaniva, lipi kavarayak thula thama kaemati apekshakayaa dakwamin pere-mudritha kolayak thabaannoya"" which translates to ""...the voter alone in the booth, puts a pre-printed sticker showing their preferred candidate inside a sealed envelope.""

This clearly indicates the voter marks their preferred candidate on something that goes inside the sealed envelope.
"
aelanta musashi sandaha wasara ataka sevimak aarambha kirimata hethu wuye kumakda?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: ohuge yuddhaya kerehi unanduwa** (his interest in war).

"mema chedayata anuwa, aelan thama mudalin saelakiya yuthu p‍ramanayak wiyadam kale kumak sandahada?","The correct answer is **B: samudra gaweshanaya (sea research)**.

The passage states: ""Lokaye dhanavatma pudgalayaku wana eelan, siya dhanayen waedi pramaanayak samudra gavesanaya sandaha aayojanaya kara aetaeyi kiya visvaasa karana atha..."" which translates to ""It is believed that Elon, who is one of the richest people in the world, plans to spend a significant amount of his money on sea research...""

Therefore, Elon is spending a considerable amount of his money on sea research.

*   **D: ayadin (iodine)** - The text mentions that the nuclear regulatory agency found evidence of cesium and iodine.

*   **C: sudu dumaraya (White smoke)** - This may be a result of the accident, but it is not explicitly mentioned as causing damage.

**Therefore, the best answer is A, B, and D.**

* **P (The News Report):** A news report is describing a problem at a nuclear power plant. It mentions white smoke, problems with air conditioning and water supply, and concerns about radiation (cesium, iodine). The report speculates that uranium fuel rods might be exposed and that this could lead to further disaster.

* **Q (The Question):**  Which of the following is *NOT* a recommended safety measure after a power plant accident, according to the information given?

Now let's analyze the options:

*   **A: vayu sameekarana ekaka bhawithayen vaelakee siteema (Using air conditioning units to stay safe):** The news report mentions that the air conditioning is *not working* (akriya kirimatat).  This implies it's not a helpful safety measure.

*   **B: aethulatha raendee siteema (Staying indoors):** This is a common recommendation during a radiation emergency to reduce exposure. The news report mentions nevasikayinta gruhasthava sitimatat (residents staying at home), meaning staying at home is a safety procedure that the news report mentioned.

*   **C: sudu dumaraya aashvasa kirimen vaelakee siteema (Staying safe by breathing in white smoke):** This is clearly dangerous. White smoke could contain harmful particles, and breathing it in would be harmful.

*   **D: nala jalaya panaya kirimen vaelakee siteema (Staying safe by drinking tap water):** The news report mentions that the water supply is affected (nala jalaya nobiimatat). Drinking contaminated water is definitely not safe.

**Therefore, the best answer is C: sudu dumaraya aashvasa kirimen vaelakee siteema (Staying safe by breathing in white smoke).**

NextGen guwan gaman palakawarunta rijuwama p‍rathilabha labaa denne keseda?,"The passage P states that NextGen provides shorter flight paths, more accurate aircraft positioning, reduced carbon emissions, and lower fuel consumption. All of these directly benefit air traffic controllers.

Therefore, all the options (A, B, C, and D) are benefits that directly impact air traffic controllers. However, the question asks *how* NextGen provides direct benefits. It's not asking *what* the benefits are.

While all are benefits, B (Wadath niwaeredi guwan yaana pihiteema - More accurate aircraft positioning) is the most *direct* way air traffic controllers benefit.  Knowing exactly where the aircraft are allows them to make better decisions and manage traffic more efficiently.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **B: wadath niwaeredi guwan yaana pihiteema**.

"mema chedayata anuwa, ithihasangayin ef. bee. ayi hi awadhaanaya yomu kirima pilibandawa wiwechanaya nokaranne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: owunge saarthakathwa anupathaya ihala naenvima (Raising their effectiveness rate)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that critics (Ithihaasagnayo) are pointing out that the FBI is focusing on easy cases (like motor vehicle theft) that are easier to solve to make their representation appear more effective. This implies that they're criticized for *not* focusing on more complex or challenging cases, and instead prioritizing things that make their success rates look good.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: pahasuwen wisandiya haeki aparadha sandaha sampath wen kirima (Allocating resources to easily solvable crimes):** The passage *explicitly* states the critics are raising this as an issue, therefore it's something they *are* criticizing.
*   **C: kaamuka darshana siddheen kerehi daedi awadhaanayak yomu kirima (Paying closer attention to pornographic incidents):** The passage mentions the FBI allocating 10 agents to adult content cases, so that's something they *are* focusing on.
*   **D: motar ratha sorakam siddheen (Motor vehicle theft incidents):** This is an example given of the ""easy"" cases the critics are pointing out the FBI is focusing on. Therefore, it's something they *are* criticizing.

Therefore, critics don't criticize regarding the effort to raise effectiveness rates, as the effort is criticised using the other options."
mema asabhyatha vaedasatahana FBI hata kirimata bala karanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: kaamuka darshana siddheen sandaha niyojithayan wen kirima** (allocating agents for pornographic cases).

* The passage states: ""Congrasaya 2005 moolya varshaye dee asabhya de sambandhayen wana mulaarambhayata aramudal saepayima aarambha kala athara ef.bee.ayi visin vaedihiti kamuka darshana sandaha niyojitayin 10 deneku ven kala yuthu bavata niyama kale ya.""
    * This translates to: ""Congress began allocating funds for initiatives related to obscenity in the 2005 fiscal year, and the FBI was required to allocate 10 agents for child pornography cases.""

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: motar ratha sorakam siddheen sandaha vaedi sampath p‍ramanayak wen kirima** (allocating more resources for motor vehicle theft cases) - While the passage mentions this as a *criticism* of the FBI, it doesn't state it as a reason for investigating obscenity. It's the opposite - critics say the FBI focuses too much on easier crimes like car theft.
* **B: niyojithayathanaye saarthakathwa anupathaya ihala naenvima** (increasing the success rate of the agency) - This is a possible underlying motive, but not the direct reason stated.
* **C: wisandeemata pahasu aparadha kerehi awadhaanaya yomu kirima** (focusing attention on crimes that are easy to solve) - This is the critique of the FBI focusing on easy crimes, not the reason they started investigating obscenity.

Therefore, the passage directly states the FBI was *required* to allocate agents to child pornography cases due to congressional funding and mandates.

The text states: ""Ohu 1945 dee ovun wetha sambandha wee 1958 dakva raendi sitiye ya."" This translates to ""He joined them in 1945 and stayed until 1958.""

"mema chedayata anuwa, hesperonichas wa welosiraeptar wethin wenaskara dakwanne kumana lakshanaya da?","Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **B: eyata wishala dewani niyapothu aetha** (it has a large second toe claw).

Here's why:

* The text directly states that *Hesdparonishas* gets its name from its large second toe claw (translated to ""basnahira niya"").
* The other options are characteristics attributed to *Velociraptor* as well (two legs, feathers, warm-blooded). The defining feature that makes *Hesdparonishas* unique in the context of the paragraph is the large claw.
"
“hesperonichas” yannehi arthaya labaa gena aeththe kumana jivi wisheshaye bhawthika lakshanayen da?,"The correct answer is **A: niyapoththa(thu)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Uge devana niya vadaa vishaala woo baevin, """"basnahira niya"""" yanna artha gaenvena hesparonishas yana namaya aethi kara ganna ladi."" This translates to: ""Because of its unusually large claw, it got the name hesparonichas, which means """"western claw.""""""

The other options are characteristics of Velociraptor mentioned in the passage, not the reason for the name ""Hesperonichas"".

wedi thaebeeme siddhiya pilibanda pahatha sandahan p‍rakaashawalin niwaeredi wanne kumakda?,"Let's analyze the given information and the options:

*   **P:** A couple was celebrating their first wedding anniversary in Buffalo with about 100 guests. The celebration was planned for a date a year after the actual wedding. They were married in Texas a year ago and came to Buffalo with friends and family for the celebration. The 30-year-old groom (Sam) who was from Buffalo was injured in an explosion, however his wife was not hurt.

*   **Q:** Which of the following statements is correct about the explosion?

Now let's look at each option:

*   **A: saemiyaa saha birinda dedenama teksas walin wethi (Sam and his wife are both from Texas):** This is incorrect. The passage states Sam is from Buffalo.

*   **B: windithayin ganana pas deneku we (There were five injured):** The passage stated that Sam was one of four people injured in the explosion. Thus the answer cannot be 5.

*   **C: mema yuwala meeta wasarakata pera baflao hi wivaha wuha (This couple got married in Buffalo a year ago):** This is incorrect. They got married in Texas a year ago.

*   **D: wedi thaebeeme siddhiya bafalo hi siduwiya (The explosion happened in Buffalo):** This is correct. The passage states that the celebration, during which the explosion occurred, was in Buffalo.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D**.
"
wedi thaebeema sidu wu sthaanaya sambandhayen kumana p‍rakaashaya niwaeredi da?,"The correct answer is **A: eya bafalo hi wivaha sanwathsara saadayaka dee siduwiya** (It happened at a wedding anniversary celebration in Buffalo).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the couple came to Buffalo ""for a wedding anniversary celebration"" (""vivaaha sanvatsaraya saemarima sandaha baffalo wetha paeminiyaha"")
*   The incident occurred at the anniversary celebration itself.

The other options are incorrect based on the information provided:

*   **B: eya sidu wuye nila sanwathsara uthsawayakadee ya** (It happened at a blue anniversary celebration) - This is incorrect, as the text mentions it was planned for a year later
*   **C: meya sidu wuye teksas hi paewathi sadayakadee ya** (It happened at an event in Texas) - The wedding was in Texas, but the explosion happened during the anniversary celebration in Buffalo.
*   **D: meya sidu wuye yawalage wivaha mangal‍yayedee ya** (It happened at the couple's wedding) - The wedding was a year prior and in Texas, the incident was at an anniversary celebration."
"mema chedayata anuwa, luno sambandhayen niladhaareenge mulika awadhaanaya yomu wuye kumak wethada?","The correct answer is **A: pohora thogaye aduwak**.

The text states: ""Meetara 100k diga naukaava ehi supurudu pohora togaya patavaa gaeneema sandaha yamin sity athara yaatraven togayak ihiriya haeki yaeyi niladhaarin mulin biya viya."" This directly translates to: ""The 100m long ship was traveling to load its usual cargo of fertilizer, and officials initially feared that a cargo would be lost from the journey."" This shows the officials were initially concerned about a loss of fertilizer cargo.
"

aeljiriyaawa nidhasa laebuwe kumana dashakaya thulada?,"The correct answer is **C: 1960 dashakaye**

The passage states: ""1960 dee ohu chitrapata adyakshanaya igaenvimata aluthin nidahasa labaa gath aelgeriyava wetha naewatha giyeya"" which translates to ""In 1960 he sailed to newly independent Algeria to teach film direction."" This clearly indicates that Algeria gained independence in the 1960s.
"
awamangal‍ya uthsawaya sandaha rupavahinee thira pihituva nothibune koheda?,"The correct answer is **D: shantha peethara chathurashraye**.

Here's why:

The passage states that due to the large crowds, ""saema denaatama santa pieter chaturasraye avamangalyaya wethata pivisimata nolaebuni"" - meaning not everyone could access or enter St. Peter's Square for the ceremony.  Because of this, screens were set up elsewhere.

Therefore, St. Peter's Square is the place where screens were *not* set up to accommodate the overflow crowd.
"
awamangal‍ya uthsawaya pawathwanu laebuwe koheda?,"The best answer is **C: shantha peethara chathurashraye**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that millions traveled to Rome to participate in the Avamangalya Uthsavaya.
*   It explicitly mentions that many people couldn't access the **Santa Pieter Chaturasraya** (St. Peter's Square) for the Avamangalya.
*   While large screens were set up in various locations in Rome and other cities, the primary event was centered at St. Peter's Square."
pipireemen pasuwa barapathala thuvala sandaha p‍rathikaara laebuwe kawuda?,"The correct answer is **B: kisiweku naetha** (no one).

The text states: ""Daedi thuwaala kisivak vaartha novoo namuth..."" which translates to ""No serious injuries were reported...""

Therefore, no one received treatment for serious injuries after the explosion.
"
gaes kaanduwak gaena vaartha kale kawuda?,"The correct answer is **A: godanaegille asalvaesiyek** (a neighbor of the building).

The passage clearly states ""Asalvaesiyeku gaes kaanduvak gaena daenum deemen pasuwa..."" which translates to ""After a neighbor reported a gas leak...""
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, p‍raharayen kopamana pirisak miya giyeda?","The passage states:

*   ""Anaturen miya giya aya 25 viyaeti nikalas aeldan, saha 21 viyaeti saekari kudbaek ya."" - This translates to ""25-year-old Nicholas Eldan and 21-year-old Zachary Kudback died in the accident.""

Therefore, two people died.

The correct answer is **B: 2**"
p‍raharaya atharathura yam awasthaawaka wedi thaebeemata asamath wu aayudhaya kaageda?,"The correct answer is **B: ookaa** (Yukage, spelled as ""yukage"" in the passage, is likely a transliteration issue).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Pasvaeni pudhgalayage hisata ilakka karana vita yukage gini aviya waeradee giya athara..."" This translates to ""When aiming at the second person's head, Yukage's firearm malfunctioned...""

Therefore, the weapon that misfired and caused the injury belonged to Yukage (Okaa)."

The passage states that ""ragby, visesayenma ragby yunion... olympik sandaha sahabhagi weemata thoraganna ladi"" (rugby, especially rugby union... was chosen to participate in the Olympics).
"
aathar ginas mulinma shantha jems geyt skaagaraya baddata gaththe awurudu keeyak sandaha da?,"The correct answer is **D: 9000**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""... ather gines ayarlanthaye doublinhi santa james get iskagaraya vasara 9,000 ta baddata gaenimata athsan kale ya.""

This translates to: ""...Arthur Guinness signed an agreement to lease the St. James's Gate brewery in Dublin, Ireland, for **9,000 years**.""

Therefore, the answer is 9000.
"
saema wasarakama ginas dolar biliyana keeyak pamana gena enne da?,"The passage P states: ""Vasara 250 kata pasu gines saema wasarakama euro biliyana 10 (ae.doo. biliyana 14.7) ka adayamak sahitha goleeya vyaparayak bavata vardhanaya viya.""

This translates to: ""After 250 years, Guinness became a global business with an annual revenue of 10 billion euros (USD 14.7 billion).""

The question Q asks: ""How many billions of dollars does Guinness bring in each year?""

The passage provides the approximate dollar amount: 14.7 billion.

Therefore, the closest answer is C: 14.
"

This translates to: ""After Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece and Italy, France is the seventh country in the European Union affected by this virus.""

Therefore, the virus has been identified in 7 countries in the European Union.

The answer is C: hathaka (seven).
"
H5N1 wairasaye nawathama rogiyaa handunaganu laebuwe koheda?,"The correct answer is **A: p‍ranshaya**

The passage states: ""Oustriyavata, germaniyata, sloveniyavata, balgeriyavata, greesiyata saha italiyata pasuwa mema vairasayen pidavata path yuropa sangamaye satvaeni rata pranshaya we.""  This translates to: ""After Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece and Italy, France is the seventh country in the European Union to be affected by this virus.""  This means France is the latest country to be affected, and therefore the country where the newest case was identified.
"
saama sadhaka bhatayan wisin wu roga wyaapthiyata pera hayitiye mema rogaya awasan warata hamu wuye kawadada?,"The correct answer is **A: 1800 ganan waladee**.

The passage states ""Hamudaa paminimata pera, 1800 gananvala sita haytiya rogaya sambandha gaetaluvalata muhuna dee tibune naetha."" This translates to ""Before the troops arrived, Haiti had not faced questions regarding the disease since the 1800s."" This directly implies that the last time Haiti had the disease was in the 1800s.
"
rogaya paethireema sandaha dayaka wu apadrawya kumana sthaanayen vida?,"The correct answer is **B: eksath jatheenge kandawura (United Nations camp)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the UN camp in Haiti, after the 2010 earthquake, may have leaked raw sewage containing cholera-causing bacteria into the Artibonite River's tributaries.
* While the Artibonite River (A) is mentioned, it's the *source* of the contamination, not the source of the raw sewage/pathogen itself.
* The 2010 earthquake (C) created the conditions, but the UN camp is pointed to as the more direct source of the contamination.
* The ""Haiti Institute for Justice and Democracy"" (D) is mentioned, but only to highlight that they have indicated that UN peacekeepers from Nepal are likely the carriers that brought cholera.

Therefore, the UN camp is the place from which the causative agent of the disease (cholera bacteria) most likely originated and contaminated the water sources.
"
ayarlantha rajaya kumak kirimata saelasumkara thibeda?,"The passage discusses a situation where the current system in a country is being opposed and temporary opportunities are being used to benefit individuals, along with concerns about drug-related punishments. The Minister is said to be dreaming about a more favourable system for drug issues.

Option A, ""mathdrawya javarama sambandha ayata waradkaruwan kirima"" (making those guilty related to drug trafficking right/correct), doesn't fit the context of introducing laws, weakening laws or legalizing.

Option B, ""mathdrawya walata awasara deema sambandhayen daedi neethi handunva deema"" (introducing strict laws regarding providing opportunities for drugs) - This doesn't correlate well with the minister wanting a more relaxed approach

Option C, ""mathdrawya walata awasara deema sambandhayen neethi lihil kirima"" (loosening laws regarding providing opportunities for drugs) - This aligns with the minister dreaming of a better system.

Option D, ""mathdrawya thahanama iwath kirima"" (removing the drug ban) - This is a more extreme version of C, but the passage doesn't imply complete removal, but a change of system.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is **C: mathdrawya walata awasara deema sambandhayen neethi lihil kirima** (loosening laws regarding providing opportunities for drugs). This reflects the minister's desire for a different system, implying a potential relaxation of current laws regarding drugs.
"
ayarlanthaye thawakaalikawa neeth‍yaanukula wuye kumakda?,"Based on the text provided, the temporary legalization in Ireland seems to relate to **D: mathdrawya (drugs)**.

The passage mentions ""adaala drawyavala thaavakalika nityaanukulabhaavayen prayojana ganna pudgalayange subhasaadhanaya saha mathdrawya sambandha dandana pilibanda soukya amaathyavaraya kanassalla pala kaleya,"" which translates to something like ""The Minister of Health spoke without dreaming about the benefit of individuals taking advantage of the temporary legalization of illegal drugs and the punishment related to drugs.""
"
saeka katayuthu waradkaru sambandhawa wimarshanaya karanne kumak pilibandawa da?,"The correct answer is **A: anawasarayen aethulu vima**

The text states that the criticism relates to ""anavasarayen aetulu weema"" which translates to ""unnecessary entry."" The question asks what the criticism is about regarding the pirimi varadakaru (male offenders). Therefore, ""anawasarayen aethulu vima"" is the relevant detail.
"
"lakuna wenas karana wita, saekakaru nokale kumakda?","Based on the translated text, the correct answer is:

**C: eyata bhawthikawa haani kirima (causing physical damage to it)**

The passage states that no physical damage was done to the sign (""Lakunata bhautikava haani nowee ya""). This means the perpetrator **did not** cause physical damage. All the other options are mentioned as actions the person *did* take.
"

"mema chedayata anuwa, rolaendo mendosa wisin p‍rana aepayata ganu nolaebuwe kawuda?","The correct answer is **B: polis niladhaareen**.

The passage describes Ronaldo Mendosa, a Philippine police officer, taking tourists hostage. The other options are mentioned as being among those taken hostage.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, kalin nidhaskara aethi bawa thahawuru nowu p‍rana aepakaruwan kawuda?","The correct answer is **A: sanchaarakayin**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""Pilipina chaayaarupa shilpin men lamun saha vaedihitiyan aetulu praana aepakaruvan hiya deneku kalin nidahas karana ladi"" meaning the Filipino photographer, Lamun and elders were freed prior. The tourist were not previously freed."
"mema chedayata anuwa, b‍raseelaye samalingika wivaha neethigatha kirimata sahaya dakwamin athsan raes karanne kawuda?","The correct answer is **A: wirodhathakaruwan**.

The passage states that those who oppose same-sex marriage hope to collect 1.2 million signatures to present to the National Congress in November. Therefore, the opponents of same-sex marriage are the ones collecting signatures.
"
wirodhathakaruwan thama pethsama idiripath karanne kaatada?,"The correct answer is **C: b‍raseela jaathika kongrasaya (Brasilaye jaathika congrasaya)**

The passage explicitly states: ""Virodhaya pala karannan novaembar maasaye dee **jaathika congrasayata** idiripath kirimata athsan miliyana 1.2 k res kirimata balaaporottu wethi."" (Those who oppose it expect to present 1.2 million signatures to the National Congress in November.)
"
"aamand warsache ge ginumata anuwa, minisun kaalaguna wenas vimata p‍rathichaara daekvimata perathuwa sidu vi aeththe kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: daedi sulan haemeeya** (A strong wind started to blow).

The passage clearly states that a strong wind started blowing before the hail and other reactions of the people. The sequence of events is:

1.  5 minutes until the show, wind starts blowing.
2.  Wind increases to 70 km/h.
3.  Rain begins, so heavy it feels like needles.
4.  Hail begins to fall.
5.  People panic.

Therefore, the wind was the first noticeable change in the weather.
"
"warsacheta anuwa, wada daedi sulan aarambha wuye kawadada?","The correct answer is **D: hima kaeta warshawata pera**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes the wind starting *before* the rain and hail (hima kaeta warshawata) began.
*   The passage follows this order: wind -> rain -> hail.
*   Options A and C are incorrect because they refer to events that happen after the wind starts.
*   Option B is incorrect because the wind comes *before* the rain.

Therefore, the strong wind started before the hail storm (hima kaeta warshawata)."
"f‍red ta pera, batahira anshaka 35ta naegenahirin p‍radhaana kunatu keeyak vaartha vi thibeda?","The passage states that Fred is the third most powerful cyclone to be reported east of 35 degrees west. This implies that there were **two** (dekak) major hurricanes reported east of 35 degrees west before Fred.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: dekak**.
"
f‍red kep werd doopath asala sitina wita eya gaman kale kumana dishawata da?,"The correct answer is **D: wayamba desata**.

The passage states: ""Fred me wana vita paeyakata saethapum 105 ka (paeyata kilo meetara 165) wegayen hamana sulang sahitava **vayamba desata** gaman karamin sitiyi."" This translates to ""Fred was moving to the **northwest** with winds blowing at 105 miles per hour (165 kilometers per hour).""

While the question asks about the direction of travel when Fred was near Cape Verde Islands, we have to assume the direction hasn't changed significantly since the passage continues to describe Fred's characteristics. Therefore, Northwest is the best answer based on the information provided.
"
ehi purogameenta wada vaedi wegayak aethi pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The passage states that 802.11n is significantly faster than its predecessors. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: 802.11n**
"
802.11b samaga pasupasata anukula vimata 802.11n sandaha awashya wana kondesi monavada?,"The correct answer is **D: dwithwa rediyo (dual radio)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Paadaka sthaanaye dvitva rediyowak thibe nam, eyata 802.11a, 802.11b saha 802.11g samaga pasupasata anukulavimata ida laebenu aetha.""

This directly translates to: ""If the base station has a dual radio, it will have the ability to be backward compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g.""

Therefore, having a dual radio is the condition required for 802.11n to be backward compatible with older standards like 802.11b.
"
poduraajya mandaleeya kreeda ulele olimpik ran padkkam labhiyaa pihinum isaw keeyaka sahabhagee wida?,"Let's break down the information given in P:

* **Olympik ran padakkamlaabhiya poduraajya mandaliya tharaga valadi meetara 100 saha 200 nidahas aara saha sahaaya pihinum tharaga tunakata sahabhaagivimata niyamithawa sity:**  This means the Olympian regularly participates in the Commonwealth Games in the 100m and 200m freestyle and a relay swimming event - that's three events.

The question (Q) asks:  ""poduraajya mandaleeya kreeda ulele olimpik ran padkkam labhiyaa pihinum isaw keeyaka sahabhagee wida?"" which translates to:  ""How many swimming events did the Olympic gold medalist participate in at the Commonwealth Games?""

From the information above, we know the athlete participated in three swimming events.  Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **B: thideneku** (three)
"
olimpik ran padkkamlabhiyaa ohuge wedanawa sandaha awshadha nogaththe aeyi?,"The correct answer is **D: poduraajya mandaleeya kreeda ulele eyata awasara naetha**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Olympian is prohibited from taking certain medication because it is banned at the Olympics. This implies the prohibition is at the Olympic level.  The question asks why he didn't take the medication for his pain, and the passage implies the answer is directly related to the ban.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ohuta kisidu wedanawak nothibuni (He had no pain):** The passage states he *does* have pain (""ohuge wedanawa samanaya kireema sandaha"").
*   **B: eya ohuta asaneepa thaththwayak aethi kaleya (It caused him a disease):** The passage doesn't mention the medication causing any illness.
*   **C: eya uge shareera yogyathawayata ahithakara lesa balapanu aethaeyi ohu saelakilimath wiya (He was concerned that it would adversely affect his physical fitness):** While this *could* be a secondary concern, the *primary* reason, as stated in the passage, is the prohibition.

**Translation of the key part of the passage:**

""Ohuge wedanawa samanaya kireema sandaha awashya aushadha olympik ulelen thahanam kara aethi nisa ohuta eva gaenimata nohaeki wee thibe.""
(Because the medicine required to relieve his pain is banned at the Olympics, he is unable to take it.)
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, bhoomikampa kriyaakaarakam pilibanda wyaakulathwayata hethu wiya haekke kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: anduru walakulu thibeema (The presence of dark clouds)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states:

*   ""...*Sathya pipirimak sidu vuye da yanna pilibandava vyaakulatavak valaakulu magin penee giye ya.*"" This translates to ""The uncertainty about whether a real eruption occurred was seen through the clouds.""

This directly links the worry or uncertainty (vyaakulatavak) about volcanic activity to the presence of the dark clouds (anduru walakulu). The passage suggests the clouds obscured the view, making it difficult to confirm an eruption and therefore causing concern.

The other options are not the primary cause of the immediate uncertainty about an eruption:

*   **B: ayislantha kaalaguna widyaa kaaryaalaye vaarthawa (Icelandic Meteorological Office's report):** The report stated no earthquake activity.
*   **C: jaath‍yanthara bhoomikampa sithiyama (International Earthquake Situation):** This is just general context, not the immediate cause of worry.
*   **D: ayislanthaye wenath p‍radeshawala vaartha wu kriyaakaarakam (Activity reported in other parts of Iceland):** The passage does not mention any activity reported in other parts of Iceland.

Therefore, only option A is the direct reason for the wyaakulatavak.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, adiyara wenasak sidu wuye kawadadaa?","The passage states: ""Adiyara wenasweemak aethi karavamin saelakiya yuthu mattame bhu kampana kriyaakaarakamak **maarthu 10 wana dina** ginikandu mudunata kalderavehi eesaana desin siduwee aetha.""

This translates to: ""A change in the baseline happened on **March 10th** when seismic activity occurred northeast of the caldera at the volcano's summit.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **C: marthu 10 wenida** (March 10th)"

Translation: The moon impact probe (MIP), released by the Minisun-free Chandrayaan-1 lunar orbiter at a speed of 1.5 kilometers per second (3000 feet per second), successfully crashed near the South Pole of the Moon. In addition to carrying three important scientific instruments, the lunar probe also carried a painting of the Indian national flag on every panel.

Now let's analyze each option:

*   **A: gaweshana yaanaya diyath kala kak‍shayata kaarya mandalayak sitayeya** - ""gaweshana yaanaya diyath kala kak‍shayata kaarya mandalayak sitayeya"" translates to ""The probe was on a lunar orbit before the MIP was released."" This is confirmed in the text as the ""Minisun rahitha chandrayaan -1 chandra kakshagatha yaanaya"" released the MIP, implying an orbiter existed. So this statement is TRUE.

*   **B: gaweshana yaanaye vaedgath upakarana thibuni** - ""gaweshana yaanaye vaedgath upakarana thibuni"" translates to ""The probe had important instruments"". The text directly states ""Vaedagat vidyaatmaka upakarana thunak gena yaamata atirekava"" (In addition to carrying three important scientific instruments) so this statement is TRUE.

*   **C: gaweshana yaanaya muda haereema saarthaka wiya** - ""gaweshana yaanaya muda haereema saarthaka wiya"" translates to ""The release of the probe was successful"". The text states ""mip mudhaa harina lada athara eya saarthakava chandrayaage dakshina draevaya asannayata kada vaetuni"" (the MIP was released and it successfully crashed near the South Pole of the Moon), so this statement is TRUE.

*   **D: gaweshana yaanaye paata kala paethi thibuni** - ""gaweshana yaanaye paata kala paethi thibuni"" translates to ""The probe had painted panels."" The text says ""chandra eshanaya saema paettakama paata kara thibu indiya jaathika kodiye rupayak da raegena giyeya"", which translates to The lunar probe also carried a painting of the Indian national flag on every panel."" Thus, this statement is TRUE.

Since all of the statements (A,B,C, and D) are true based on the provided text, and the question asks for a FALSE statement, there appears to be an error in the question or the text provided. It's possible there is additional context that is not provided. Based solely on the information given, none of the options are false.

chandra gaweshanaya niwaerediwa wisthara karanne pahatha sandahan p‍rakaashawalin kawareda?,"Statement Q asks which of the statements accurately describe the lunar research. Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: eya chandrayaage uthuru dhraewayata aasannawa goda baesseya (It landed near the North Pole of the moon)** - The passage states that it landed near the *south* pole. So, this is incorrect.
*   **B: ehi hadisi godabaema saarthaka wiya (Its crash landing was successful)** - The passage states, ""eya saarthakava chandrayaage dakshina draevaya asannayata kada vaetuni"" which translates to ""it successfully crashed near the south pole of the moon."" So, this is correct.
*   **C: eya minisun sahitha kak‍shayakin muda harina ladee (It was released from a manned orbit)** - The passage explicitly states ""minisun rahitha chandrayaan -1"" which means ""unmanned Chandrayaan-1"". So this is incorrect.
*   **D: eya vaedgath upakarana dekak raegena yamin thibuni (It was carrying two important instruments)** - The passage says ""vaedagat vidyaatmaka upakarana thunak gena yaamata atirekava"", meaning ""in addition to carrying three important scientific instruments"". So this is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B**."
"mema chedayata anuwa, awasana washayen kriyaathmaka karanu labana roga vaelaekvime piyawara wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: enseflayitis ennath**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that in the previous year, the government agreed to obtain millions of vials of encephalitis (enseflayitis) vaccine to better prepare health institutions.
* It also says that in this year, there were plans to distribute the vaccine in historically affected regions.

The other options are mentioned as actions taken, but they are not directly related to active immunization (vaccination) of the population:
*   **A: palibodhanashaka** (Pesticides) were used.
*   **B: pig kaechar** (Pig catcher) was used.
*   **D: maduru dael** (Mosquito nets) were distributed.

Therefore, the final active measure related to disease prevention is the vaccine (Encephalitis Ennath).
"
mema rogaya minisunta samp‍reshanaya wanne keseda?,"The correct answer is **A: maduruwangen (from mosquitoes)**

The passage clearly states: ""mema rogaya uran magin sampreshanaya karanu labana athara pasuwa maduruvan haraha minisun wetha aasaadanaya we"" which translates to ""This disease is transmitted through...and later transmitted to humans through mosquitoes"".
"
dewana waganthiye asaarthakathwaya hethu wiya haekke kumana p‍rathiphalayata da?,"The correct answer is **B: samalingika siwil ekathuvimwala anagatha ayithivasikamak** (Future rights for same-sex civil unions).

The passage states that the failure of the second clause, which aimed to prohibit same-sex civil unions, ""opens the door for civil unions in the future.""
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, dewana waganthiya makaa daemuwe kawadada?","The correct answer is **A: vyavasthaadayaka saesiya atharathura** (Legislative session interval).

The passage states that ""Niyojitha manthri mandalaya visin palamuwa devana waganthiya makaa damanu laebiimen pasuwa mema niti sampaadana saesiyata venas kireemak sidu karana lada athara..."" which translates to ""After the appointed cabinet first failed to remove the second clause, a change was made to this legislation session..."" This implies the failure to remove the clause happened during a legislative session. Thus, after this initial failure, changes were made to the bill *during* the legislative session.
"
“paenama path‍rikaa” anawaranaya wuye kaa hatada?,"The correct answer is **A: mosaek fonsekaa samagama**

The passage states: ""paenama pathrika yanu 2016 vasantayedi paenamaa niti samaagamak wana mosaek fonseka wethin maadhyata anaavaranaya woo..."" which translates to ""The Panama Papers is a common term applied to a collection of approximately ten million documents that were revealed to the media by the Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca in the spring of 2016.""
"
"ema chedayata anuwa, dhanaya saegavimata bhawitha kala boho samagam kalamanakaranaya kala bawa b‍rithan‍ya maadhya kiyaa sitiye kawuda?","The correct answer is **C: doyish baenkuwa**.

The passage states: ""Brithanya puvathpathak wana da gaardiyan pavasaa sitiye mema aramuna saakshaath karagaenima sandaha bhavitha woo shell samaagam 1200 n thunen dekak pamana paalanaya kale doyish baenkuva bavayi.""  This translates to ""British newspaper The Guardian stated that Deutsche Bank controlled about two-thirds of the 1200 shell companies used to achieve this goal (hiding money).""
"
vaedima marana sankyaawak siduwa aeththe pahatha sandahan guwan yaana anathuru walin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A and D**. Here's why:

*   **A: iranaye sita aarmeniyaawa bala yamin sitiya dee guwan yaanaya anathurata lak wiya** - The passage states that a plane crashed while flying to Armenia from Iran, resulting in the deaths of 168 people, making it the worst aviation disaster in years.

*   **D: mashhad hi guwan yaanaya anaturata lak wiya** - The passage mentions that in the same month, a plane overran the runway in Mashhad, crashed into a wall, and killed ten people.

**Option B** is incorrect because the police helicopter crash only resulted in 3 deaths, and **Option C** is incorrect as it states the opposite direction of the flight."

iraaka adhyayana kandayame vaarthawata aethulath kara nomaeththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: yam yam wenaskam samaga irakaye wardhanaya wana p‍rachandathwaya walakva gatha haeki bawata p‍rakaashayak (A statement that Iraq's increasing violence can be prevented with certain changes)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the report argues that *no one* can be certain that any actions in Iraq will bring new stability or avoid escalating violence/instability ( ""...kisivekuta sahatika kala nohaeki bhava...""). This is the *opposite* of saying that violence can be prevented with specific changes.

Let's look at why the other options *are* included in the report:

*   **A: wathman p‍rathipaththiya wiwechanaya kirima (Criticizing current policy):** The passage states the report is very critical of current Iraq policy (""ithaamath tiranaatmaka wana athara"")
*   **C: iarakaye deshaseema surak‍shitha kirima sandaha wana nirdesha (A suggestion for protecting Iraq's borders):** The passage mentions one of the 78 recommendations is to protect Iraq's borders against foreign intervention (""saturu maedihat vimvalata erehiva iraaqaye desasima aaraksha kirimata"").
*   **D: eksath janapada podu ekagathawak sandaha aayaachanayak (An appeal for common consensus of USA):** The report opens with a call for open discussion and a common consensus within the US regarding Middle East policy (""eksath janapadaya thula podu ekaghathaawayak gaena aayachanaya samagin vaarthaava vivurta we"")."
iaraka adhyayana kandayama wisin siya vaarthawe illa nositiye pahatha sandahan karunu walin kawareda?,"Based on the passage, the Iraq Study Group report *did* call for the following:

*   **C: Wiwurtha wivada bhawitha kirima** (Using open debate) - The passage mentions ""Vivurta vivaadayak sandaha illimak"" which translates to ""A request for open debate.""
*   **D: Nawa thanapathi kriyaamarga gaeneema** (Implementing new diplomatic measures) - The passage states ""Mema vasara avasan weemata pere nava thaanaapathi kriyaamaarga gatha yuthu bavaya,"" meaning ""New diplomatic actions should be taken before the end of this year.""

The report *did not* call for:

*   **B: Kshanikawa dishawa wenas kirima** (Immediately changing direction) - While the report advocated for a change of direction, it did not emphasize that the changes have to happen immediately

The report is implying there are issues with **A: Wardhanaya wana p‍rachandathwaya naevaethvime sahathikayak p‍rakaashayata path kirima** (Affirming the increase in violence as an innovation)
Iraqa adyayana kandaayama siya vaarthaava ada grinich madyahna welawen 12.00ta idiripath kale ya.

"
"polisiyata anuwa, prowensanoge dakunath minisa lesa salakanu laebuwe kawuda?","The correct answer is **B: lo pikkoolo**.

The text states: ""Polisiya paevasu paridi paelarmohidee provensanoge dakunu atha men sity baevin low pikolo mehi pradhaanathvaya ganna athara...""  This translates to ""According to the police, City baevin low pikolo, like Provensano's right hand in Palermo, takes precedence here...""

Therefore, lo pikkoolo is considered Provensano's right-hand man according to the police.
"
mema chedaye sandahan kara aethi thorathuru anuwa faelkoonge maranayata hethu wuye kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: reena wisin meheyawana lada yuddhayeedee ohu mara damana ladee**.

The passage states: ""1992 dee mafia kurusa yuddha bhatayan wana geovani falcon saha pavulo borselinoge jivita biligath rajayata erehi rayina visin meheyavana lada yuddhaya avasan karana vita provensano visin mema pradhanin nawatha sevaye yodava tibuni.""  This translates to: ""In 1992, mafia crusaders Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino were sacrificed in the war operated by Riina against the state, when Provenzano had redeployed these leaders.""

Therefore, Falcone was killed in the war led by Riina.
"
hitoshi sayitoge sammana walin ekak nowanne pahatha sandahan karunu walin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: loka shoorathawa dewarak**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states Hitoshi Saito won **one** world championship (loka shurayaku).
*   The passage mentions he won **two** Olympic gold medals (olimpik ran padakkam dekak).
*   The passage says he was the chairman of the training committee (puhunu kamituve sabhaapativaraya) of the All Japan Judo Federation (samastha japaana judo kamituve sammelanaye).
*   Although not directly mentioned that he is a judo expert, but the content clearly suggests he is a judo expert.

Therefore, the statement ""loka shoorathawa dewarak"" (two world championships) is incorrect."
tharjana walin vaelakee siteemata ivasaki samath wuye koheda?,"Based on the information in passage P, ""nepaalaye dee vivaahayen paenagos indiyave dee athadanguvata path viya"" which translates to ""in Nepal, went through marriage and in India, faced imprisonment.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: indiyaawa**.
"
ivasakita pahara dunne kawuda?,"Based on the provided text:

*   ""tibetaye dee viyaru balleku visin pahara denu laeba"" translates to ""In Tibet, he was attacked by a bear"".

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **C: ballek** (bear)"
aelonso ohuge dhaawana tharagaya awasan kale kawadada?,"The correct answer is **C: shumakar ohugema dhaawana tharagaya awasan kirimen pasu**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""alonsota pasuwa waedi kaalayak gatha weemata pera tharagaya avasan kale, tharagaya thula pawathi tharangakari satan gananaavakin pasuwa avalambanayata sidu woo haaniyana nisaaveni."" This translates to ""Alonso finished the race before a significant time had passed after Schumacher finished the race, due to damage to the suspension after several competitive battles during the race."" Thus, Schumacher finished the race prior to Alonso."
shoomakar niyamitha welawata pera tharagaya awasan kirimata hethuwa kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: motar rathaye awalambhanayata sidu wu haaniya** (damage to the motor car's suspension).

The text explicitly states: ""Mayikal shoomaakar, alonsota pasuwa waedi kaalayak gatha weemata pera tharagaya avasan kale, tharagaya thula pawathi tharangakari satan gananaavakin pasuwa **avalambanayata sidu woo haaniyana nisaaveni**."" which translates to ""Michael Schumacher finished the race shortly after Alonso, due to **damage to the suspension** after a number of competitive battles in the race.""
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, ath adanguwata path wuwan sandaha aepa labaa gaeneema wuye kaage wagakeemak da?","The correct answer is **D: adhikarana komasariswarayaa**.

The passage states: ""Anumatha karanu laebuwahoth, komasaarisvaraya visin aepa panawanu labana..."" which translates to ""If approved, the magistrate (adhikarana komasariswarayaa) will issue the warrant (aepa)...""
"
"mema chedaye sandahan thawakaalika varana niyogayata anuwa, ath adanguwata path pudgalayaa paeya 24 kata wada vaedi kaalayak randava thabaa gaeneemata nam owunta ida labaa diya yuththe kumak sandaha da?","The correct answer is **A: aepa**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Anumatha karanu laebuwahoth, komasaarisvaraya visin aepa panawanu labana..."". This means that IF approval is given, the Commissioner will issue an ""aepa"" (likely an application or permit). The passage then mentions that the arrested officer's charges will be approved as well.

The text also mentions the judge is trying to prevent individuals from being held for more than 24 hours without due process, so it is correct to say that for them to be held for longer than 24 hours, the Commissioner has to approve a permit or some other type of application.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, awalangu karana maethivaranaya paehaedili kirimata bhaavitha nokarana lada hethuwa kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: aandukrama vyawasthaawe parasparathaawak**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Athireka mahamaetivaranaya avalangu kireema aandukrama vyavasthaavata patahaeni vanu aetaeyi sandahan woo pere vaarthaa valata meya patahaeni we."" This translates to ""Applying extra majorities is contrary to the constitution, which is what previous reports say.""

This clearly indicates that the constitutional conflict (aandukrama vyawasthaawe parasparathaawak) is the reason the majority is not being used. The other options are factors mentioned in the passage, but not the primary reason for not using the majority.
"
awasanaye raajya thanthrikayan visin mema maethivaranaya anawashya ekak lesa salakanu laebuwe aeyi?,"Based on the provided passage, the correct answer is:

**A: eya vyavasthaavata patahaeni viya** (It is contrary to the constitution)

The passage states: ""Athireka mahamaetivaranaya avalangu kireema aandukrama vyavasthaavata patahaeni vanu aetaeyi sandahan woo pere vaarthaa valata meya patahaeni we."" This translates to: ""Applying the extra majoritarianism is contrary to the constitution, and this is contrary to previous reports.""

Therefore, the reason the diplomats consider the majoritarianism unnecessary is because it is contrary to the constitution.
"
FATA sandaha adhikarana sewa sapayanne kawuda?,"The passage states: ""mem niyojitayan paakisthana vyavasthaave 247 wana waganthiya yatathe raajya saha adhikarana sevaa saepayimata vaga kiyanu labayi."" which translates to ""These appointees are responsible for providing state and judicial services under Article 247 of the Pakistani Constitution.""

The passage identifies the appointees as ""deshapaalana niyojitayan"" which translates to ""political appointees"" or ""political agents.""

Therefore the correct answer is **B: deshapalana niyojithayan**
"
FATA hi “deshapalana niyojithayan” pilibanda pahatha sandahan prakaashayangen sathya nowanne kawareda?,"The passage states that:

*   ""Political Agents"" (deshapaalana niyojitayan) are appointed by the President of Pakistan to administer FATA.
*   These agents implement a system close to full independent governance in the regions.
*   They are accountable for state and judicial services under Article 247 of the Pakistani Constitution.

Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: owun adhikarana sewa sapayayi (They provide judicial services):** This aligns with the passage's statement that they are accountable for judicial services.
*   **B: owun pakisthana janaadhipathiwaraya visin thoraa pathkara gaene (They are appointed by the President of Pakistan):** This also directly matches information in the passage.
*   **C: owun pakisthanaye vyavasthaavata anugatha wethi (They are in accordance with the Pakistani constitution):** The reference to Article 247 implies they operate within the constitutional framework.
*   **D: owunta aethaem pradeshawala poorna swadheena palanaya aetha (They have full independent governance in those regions):** The passage explicitly says they implement a system *close* to full independent governance, not full independent governance itself.

Therefore, the statement that is NOT true is **D: owunta aethaem pradeshawala poorna swadheena palanaya aetha**.
"
ema ston hata naama yojanaa dena lada sammanaya kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: hondama niliya** (best actress).

The text mentions ""Rayan goslin saha emaa ston rangapae, mema chitrapataya, siyaluma pradhaana kaandavalin naama yojana sandaha nirdesha wee tibini,"" which translates to ""Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, for this film, have been nominated in all major categories."" ""Hondama naluva saha niliya"" (best actor and actress) is mentioned later in the text, indicating their nominations were for acting roles. Since the question asks about Emma Stone, the answer is best actress.
"
mema chithrapataya sandaha naamayojanaa nolaebune kumana sammanaya sandaha da?,"Let's analyze the information provided. The passage lists several nominations the film received, including:

*   Hondama chitrapataya (Best Picture)
*   Hondama sinamaakaranaya (Best Cinematography)
*   Aendum nirmaanaya (Costume Design)
*   Chitrapata sanskaranaya (Film Editing)
*   Nispadana saelasuma (Production Design)
*   Shabda sanskaranaya (Sound Editing)
*   Shabda muhu kireema (Sound Mixing)
*   Mull tira wadanaya (Original Screenplay)
*   Hondama Githaya for two songs (Best Original Song)

The question asks which award the film **did not** receive a nomination for.

*   A: hondama chitrapataya (Best Picture) - It received a nomination.
*   B: hondama drushya prayoga (Best Visual Effects) - This is NOT mentioned in the list of nominations.
*   C: hondama shabda muhu kirima (Sound Mixing) - It received a nomination.
*   D: hondama mul geethaya (Best Original Song) - It received a nomination (for two songs).

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: hondama drushya prayoga (Best Visual Effects)**."
bhoomikampawen pasu thawamath kriyathmaka wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"Let's break down the information to find the answer.

*   **The passage states:** ""...shikaa nyashtika balaagaaraye anka 1 saha 2 prathikriyaakaaraka wasaa dama aethi bawath hokuriku viduli bala samaagama visin vaarthaa karana ladi."" This means reactors number 1 and 2 at the Shika nuclear power plant are *stopped* (thawamath).

*   **The passage states:** ""...isikava praantayehi noto guvan totupala thawamath wasaa damaa aetha."" This means the Noto airport in Ishikawa Prefecture is *stopped* (thawamath).

*   **The passage states:** ""...balapaemata lak woo pradeshawala mahaa maarga samaharak haani wee dumriya sevayata baadha wee aethi athara..."" This means train services are *disrupted* (baadha wee aethi). They are not completely stopped, but not functioning normally.

Now, let's look at the options:

*   **A: hokurikuge shika balaagaraye siyaluma prathikriyaakaraka** - The passage only says reactors 1 and 2 are stopped. It doesn't say all reactors are stopped.

*   **B: ishikawa hi guvan thotupala** - The passage mentions that Noto Airport is closed.

*   **C: siyaluma dumriya sewa** - The passage states that train services have been *disrupted* which implies that at least some may not be operating.

*   **D: neegatha hi balaagarayak** - The passage does not indicate any details related to the state of the nuclear power plant located in Niigata.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: ishikawa hi guvan thotupala** because the passage directly states that the Noto airport in Ishikawa Prefecture is stopped."
"mema chedayata anuwa, bhoomikampawen haaniyata path wuye pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **all of the above**.

The text states:

*   **A: samahara niwasa (Some houses):** ""Kalaapaye nivasa 9400 ta jalaya nomaeti bawath, aasanna washayen nivasa 100 ta viduli balaya nomaeti bawath vaarthaa we."" - 9400 houses without water and approximately 100 houses without electricity.
*   **B: shika balaagaraye prathikriyaakaraka dekak (Two reactors at the Shika power plant):** ""Bhumikampaaven kisidu balapaemak sidu novoo bawath ehi shikaa nyashtika balaagaaraye anka 1 saha 2 prathikriyaakaaraka wasaa dama aethi bawath..."" - Reactors number 1 and 2 at the Shika nuclear power plant were shut down.
*   **C: samahara maarga (Some roads):** ""Balapaemata lak woo pradeshawala mahaa maarga samaharak haani wee..."" - Some major roads in the affected areas were damaged.
*   **D: noto guvan thotupala (Noto Airport):** ""isikava praantayehi noto guvan totupala thawamath wasaa damaa aetha."" - Noto Airport in Ishikawa Prefecture is temporarily closed.

Therefore, all the options listed were damaged in the earthquake.

"mema chedayata anuwa, lekhanayata aethulath nokarana ladde pahatha sandahan prashnawalin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: 1967 yuddhayata hethuwa (The cause of the 1967 war)**.

Here's why:

*   **P** clearly states the article deals with borders related to the pre-1967 war, focusing on Palestine's needs and border issues. It also discusses the future of Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley conflict.
*   The passage also goes into detail about the troop deployment in the Jordan Valley (C) and border disputes (D).
*   Jerusalem's future (A) is directly mentioned.

The passage mentions the 1967 war as a reference point for borders, but it doesn't explore the causes or reasons behind the war itself."
palastheena illeemwalin ekak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: jordan nimnaye daenata pawathina hamuda yedaweema.**

Here's why:

* **P states:** The document discusses borders *before* the 1967 war and the future of Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley.
* **A (yuddhayata pera thathwayan matha padanam wu deshaseema):** This aligns with the document's focus on pre-1967 borders.
* **C (jerusalame anaagathaya pilibanda wu pilithuru):** The document explicitly mentions the future of Jerusalem.
* **D (jordan nimnaye wasara pahaka hamuda yedaweemak):** This refers to a proposed *future* military deployment in the Jordan Valley.

The passage doesn't suggest the Palestinian document would align with *current* military deployment in the Jordan Valley. Therefore, the current military deployment is the correct choice.
"
maa neethiya haedaeruwe kumana rate da?,"Based on the passage, the person mentioned:

*   Worked at Yale University's School of Public Policy.
*   Lived in America for 13 years and obtained a ""green card"" (US permanent residency).
*   Has close ties to mainland China.
*   From Hong Kong.

The question asks about the person's political header (or direction). It is stated in the passage that the person is from Hong Kong,

Therefore, the answer is **D: Hong Kong**."
"mema chedayata anuwa, maa ge maethivarana jayagrahanayata udaw kale kumana rata wenuwen penee siteemada?","The answer is **D: Cheenaya (China)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the person in question lives in the US, but is from Hong Kong, teaches at Yale, and has a Green Card. The passage is also about their efforts to create a platform regarding the relationship between **China's mainland** and Hong Kong.
* The question asks who did they write about to help win the election.
* Based on the passage, they were focused on a China-related issue.

Therefore, the most relevant answer is **D: Cheenaya (China)**.
"
"mema chedaye sandahan wana paridi, kaerolin vilsan nagarayen pitaweemata pera waeda kale ka wenuwen da?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**.

The passage states, ""OHA hi kaerolin vilsan thamange aarakshitha thaenpatu soraagena, nagarayen paena gos aethi bhava ya"" which translates to ""Because OHA's Carolin Wilson had stolen her protective setting/position, she had left the city"". This clearly indicates that she worked for OHA.
"
"mema tharaga waraye ithiriwa aethi tharaga hatharak samagin, dhaawana shurathaavaliye hatharawana sthaanaye sitinne kawuda?","The correct answer is **D: boyar**

Here's the breakdown:

*   The passage states that Hamlin is in third place and ""pahak idiriyen sity"" (five ahead of) Boyar. This means Boyar is in fourth place."
"mema chedaye sandahan dhaawana tharagayen pasuwa, dhaawana shurathaavaliye kahn sathuwa lakunu keeyak thibeda?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The passage states: ""khaan saha truveks juniyar piliwelin lakunu 2,220 k saha 2,207 k labaa pas wana saha hiya wana sthsanaye sititi"" which translates to ""Kahn and Truex Jr. respectively scored 2,220 and 2,207 points and are in fifth and sixth place"".
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, pasukaleenawa angaharu sambhawayak aethi bawa thahawuru kala ulkaapaatha waetena aakaraya minisun kee wathawak daeka thibeda?","The text states: ""Pruthuwiyata vaetena, angaharu grahayaage bavata thahavuru kala drawya minisun visin niriksana kala ithihaasaye pas wana avasthaava meya bhava visvaasa kere.""

This translates to: ""It is believed that this is the fifth time in history that humans have observed material falling on Earth that is confirmed to be from Mars.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: pas wathawak (five times)**.
"
"mema chedaye sandahan wana paridi, angaharu sambhawayak aethi bawata soyagath paashana pilibanda wu sathyaya kumakda?","The correct answer is **D: ewa 34k aetha**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Pruthuwiyata pathitha wee aethi dhala washayen 24,000kata aasanna hadunaagata ulkaapaatha pramaanaya atharin angaharu sambhavayak aethi eva bavata thahavuru wee aeththe **34** k pamani."" (Among the approximately 24,000 known meteorites that have fallen to Earth, only **34** have been confirmed to be of Martian origin.)

The other options are incorrect because:

*   A: Only 15 of those 34 are from July's Meteor shower, not all of them.
*   B: There are 24,000 meteorites in general, not just Mars originated ones.
*   C: The value of rare rocks does not apply to all the 34 meteorites."
shoomakar vishraama giye kawada da?,"The correct answer is **B: ohuge hathweni shurathaavaya dinaa gaeneemen pasuwa**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Formiyula 1 shurathaavaya hath vataavak dinaa gaenimen pasu 2006 dee wishraama gath shoomaakar...""  This directly translates to: ""Schumacher retired in 2006 after winning his seventh Formula 1 championship...""
"

The passage states: ""2009 varshaye hangeriyaanu graend pricks tarangaavaliya atharathura aethivu anaturin brasiliyaanuvaage hisata thadabala thuwaala aethiviya."" This directly translates to ""During the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix series, the Brazilian suffered a serious head injury in an accident.""
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, mema vidhividhaana e. o. el walata balapanu aeththe keseda?","Let's break down the paragraph and the question to find the right answer.

* **P (Premise):** e.or.el (let's assume this is AOL, based on the mention of Yahoo! and Microsoft later) was able to quickly grow and develop its instant messaging business due to its wide use in the United States.  However, implementing this system *could* lead to the *end of this freedom*.  Yahoo! and Microsoft user numbers, *combined*, are comparable to (or bigger than) AOL's.

* **Q (Question):** According to this passage, how will this system affect e.o.l (AOL)?

Now let's look at the answer choices:

* **A: e. o. el bhaavitha karannange sankyawa waedi wanu aetha (AOL user numbers will increase).** This is unlikely. The passage suggests the *opposite*. The system *could* end the freedom AOL had, and Yahoo!/Microsoft's combined user base is already significant.

* **B: kshanika panivida welandapola sanvardhanaya karana ekama samaagama e. o. el wanu aetha (AOL will be the only company developing the instant messaging market).** This is incorrect. The passage mentions Yahoo! and Microsoft as competitors.

* **C: yahoo saha mayikrosoft bhaavitha karannange sankyawa e. o. el bhaavitha karannange sankyawa samaga tharaga wadinu aetha (Yahoo and Microsoft user numbers will compete with AOL user numbers).** This is the *most likely* and relevant to the question. The passage explicitly states that Yahoo! and Microsoft's combined user base is a significant factor, implying direct competition.

* **D: e. o. el thawaduratath eksath janapadaye bhaavitha nokarenu aetha (AOL will no longer be used in the United States).** This is too extreme. The passage says the *freedom* AOL had might end, but not that it will disappear completely.

Therefore, the best answer is **C**."
nawa vidhividhaanayen pasuwa awasan viya haekke pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The answer is **C: thamangema wegayakin welandapola sanvardhanaya kirimata e. o. el hata nidahasa (the freedom of AOL to develop the market at its own pace)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the current system allows AOL (or e.o.l) to grow and develop the instant messaging market at a rapid pace. The passage also warns that implementing a new system could *end* this freedom. Therefore, the new system could lead to the end of AOL's freedom to develop the market at its own pace.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: eksath janapadaye pulul antharjala sanvardhanaya (The widespread internet development in the United States)**: The passage doesn't directly state the widespread internet development in the United States will end with this new method.
*   **B: kshanika panivida welandapola bhaavithaya (The usage of the instant messaging market)**: The passage doesn't say the usage of instant messaging market will end, it suggests that the *growth and development* of that market by AOL might be hindered.
*   **D: yahoo saha mayikrosoft hawulkarithwaya (The partnerships of Yahoo and Microsoft)**: The passage mentions Yahoo and Microsoft in relation to the number of users, but doesn't imply the new method will end their partnerships."
prahaarayen miya giya ayagen kee denek polis niladhaareen nowanneda?,"Let's break down the information in the passage:

*   **Total fatalities:** 1
*   **Injured:** 20
*   **Injured who are police officers:** 10
*   **Group claiming responsibility:** ISIS (Daesh)

The question asks: How many of the **fatalities** were NOT police officers? The passage states that only one person died. Since ten police officers were injured, the fatality was not a police officer. Therefore, the number of fatalities that were not police officers is 1. As 1 is not an option, the closest answer is **C: 0** as no police officer was reported to have died.
"
mema prahaaraya sambandha saekakaru pilibandawawa waartha kale kawuda?,"The correct answer is **A: polisiya**.

The passage states: ""Me prahaaraye wagakeema sambandhava daayish (isil) satankaamiyek saeka karana bhava **polisiya** pawasai."" (The police said that an ISIS militant is suspected in connection with the attack.)
"
"mema janapadaye jayagraahakaya siyalu janapadawala jayagraahakaya wanu aetha yana floridaawe thaththwaya hethuwen, mit romnita pirinamana ladde kumak da?","Based on the provided text (P), the answer is **C: janapadaye niyojanayan siyallama** (All the state's nominations).

The text states: ""Siyalu janapada dinagat jayagraahakayaku lesa, romni wetha floridava siya niyojanayan panahama pirinaemu athara, eya ohu repablikan paksha apeksakayaa lesa idiri pelin thabaamin idiriyata gene giyeya.""

This translates to: ""As the winner of all the state's votes, Florida awarded Romney all of its nominations, which moved him forward, placing him in the front line as a Republican Party candidate.""

Therefore, Mit Romney was awarded all of Florida's nominations.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, moolika maethivaranachayen gingrichta laebunu chanda prathishathaya kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: siyayata 32**.

The passage states that Newt Gingrich received approximately 32 percent of the vote."
"mema chedayata anuwa, kokas hamuwe prathiphalayen pasuwa digata ma tharaga nokale kawuda?","The correct answer is **B: baechman**.

The passage states: ""Agostuvedi aims strow chandayen dinoo baekman, aege prachaaraka vyaapaaraya avasan kirimata tiranaya kaalaya."" This translates to ""Bachmann, who won the Ames Straw Poll in August, decided to end her campaign."" Since she ended her campaign, she did not continue competing after the mentioned results.
"
"mema chedaya anuwa, kokas hamuwe prathiphalayak lesa wenath apekshakayeku gaena ihalin katha kale kawuda?","The passage states: ""Pratiphala paeminimen pasuwa, gingrich, saentoram hata prashansaa kalada..."" This translates to ""After the results came in, he praised Gingrich and Santorum...""

The question asks who spoke highly of another candidate after the results. The passage explicitly says that **Romney** praised Gingrich and Santorum. Therefore, the answer is **B: gingrich.** (because Santorum is not an option, and gingrich is).
"

This translates to: ""In its early days, this program was presented exclusively on TogiNet Radio, a long-running internet talk radio website.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: TogiNet rediyo**.
"
mema madyasthaanaya pradarshanaya visthara karanne kumana aakaraye bhramanayak aethi lesada?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: kalaanuroopa nowu**

The passage states: ""Madyasthaanaye web adaviyen pradarshanaya visthara karanne **""""nava ha saahasika kaalanurupa novoo bhugoliya bramanayen yuth paerani pasael guvanviduli rangahalak!""""** lesa ya."" This translates to: ""The website exhibition details a **""""new and adventurous non-chronological geographical tour of the old school radio theatre!""""**""

Therefore, ""kalaanuroopa novoo"" (non-chronological) directly describes the type of tour/rotation being described.
"

Therefore, the answer is **C**.

This translates to ""He, Nadal, defeated Raonic in the Brisbane Open tournament.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **C: nadaal ronik paraajaya kaleya** (Nadal defeated Raonic)"
"mema chedayata anuwa, palamu pirinaemeemen pasuwa nadaal saha ronikge tharagaye sthaawaraya kumak weeda?","Let's analyze the provided text and the question.

The question asks: *According to the text, what was the status of Nadal and Ronik's match after the first innings?*  Note ""Palamu pirinaemeemen pasuwa"" translates to ""after the first innings"" in this context.

Let's look at the relevant parts of the text P:

*   ""Kaenediyaanuvanta erehiva nadalge karata kara vaarthaava 7-2 ki."" - This translates to ""Nadal won against the Canadian with a score of 7-2."" This tells us the final score of the overall match, not the first innings.
*   ""Ohu naevatat maethaka dee brisben vivurta tarangavaliye dee raeyonik hata paraajaya viya."" - This translates to ""He (Nadal) defeated Raonic in the Brisbane Open tournament.""  This is general information about the match, not the state *after* the first innings.
*   ""Palamu pirinaemeeme dee lakunu 76k labaa ganimin nadal tharagaye 88%ka suddha lakunu labaa gatte ya."" - This translates to ""In the first innings, Nadal scored 76 points and achieved a net score of 88% in the match"". **This is the key sentence.**
* ""Tharagayen pasuwa cley hi raju mese prakaasha kaleya, """"ithaama vaedagat isavvavala avasan vatayata naewatha paeminima pilibandava maa ithama satutata path venava. maa paemina aeththe meya jayagrahanaya kirimata uthsaaha kirimatayi."""""" - Translates to: ""After the match, the king of clay stated, 'I am very happy to have come to the final round of this very important event. I came to try and win this.'"" Irrelevant to the question

Now let's look at the options:

*   A: ""ronikta shuddha lakunu 88%k thibuni"" - ""Ronik had a net score of 88%"". This is incorrect, the text says Nadal had 88%.
*   B: ""nadaal lakunu 76k laba gaththeya"" - ""Nadal scored 76 points"". This is correct because the text says 'Palamu pirinaemeeme dee lakunu 76k labaa ganimin nadal tharagaye...'
*   C: ""lakunu thathwaya 7-2 viya"" - ""The score was 7-2"". This is the final score of the entire match, *not* after the first innings.
*   D: ""ronik nadaalwa paraajaya kaleya"" - ""Ronik defeated Nadal"". This is incorrect; the text says Nadal defeated Raonic.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B**.
"

*   ""spanngna, itaali, saha koriyanu-bhaashaa vaedasatahan"" - implies Spanish, Italian, and Korean language websites.
*   ""Ingrisi saha japan bhaashaavangen me wana vitat vaartakaranaye niyuthu wana mema goleeya sanvidhaanaya"" - suggests English and Japanese are also used in this communication network.

Thus, the correct answer must be any of these options. However, based on the passage, they're all associated with language websites, so each option is valid.

As all the options were extracted from the text, I think all of them are right. In absence of further information, I will choose based on the order they appear on text P:

**A: ithali**"
"mema chedayata anuwa, nawa nekad niwus vikaashanaya laba gatha nohaeki wanne koheda?","Let's break down the passage and the question:

*   **P (Translated roughly):** New development of digital content, the practice of making news an essential global language-spanning content generation system, and the ability to make this happen in various languages. English and Japanese are used to create this large content generation. The global network will be delivered to languages like Spanish, Italian, and Korean, and to television, websites, and mobile devices.

*   **Q (Translated roughly):** According to this, where can't new content development be obtained?

Based on the translation:

The passage explicitly mentions that the new content development will be delivered to:

*   Roopawahiniya (television)
*   Web adaviya (websites/internet)
*   Jangama upangavalata (mobile devices)

It does not mention anything about ""sinamahal"" (cinemas).

Therefore, the answer is:

**C: sinamahal**

*   **B: kreedikawan 45 denek gayant slalom tharagaye dee owunge dhaawana tharagaya awasan nokalaha** The text explicitly states that 45 athletes out of 117 in the giant slalom (second race) *failed to finish* (were unable to be classified in the race). Therefore, this statement is **correct**.

*   **C: slalom tharagayata wadaa kreedakayin waedi pirisak gayant slalom tharagaya awasan kalaha.**
    *   In the slalom race, 116 racers participated, and 36 failed to finish, so 80 finished.
    *   In the giant slalom, 117 racers participated, and 45 failed to finish, so 72 finished.
    Therefore, this statement is **incorrect**.

*   **D: kapenaado slalom tharagaya dasawaeniyata awasan kalaya** The text states Karpenado finished tenth in the *giant slalom*.  It says nothing about her slalom finish. Therefore, this statement is **incorrect**.

Therefore, the only correct answer is **B**."

Here's why:

* **P states:** The NBA suspended its season due to COVID-19 related concerns *after* a Utah Jazz player tested positive for the virus.
* **Q asks:** What led to the NBA's suspension decision?

The passage directly implies that the confirmed case of COVID-19 is what triggered the suspension. Therefore, any player testing positive for COVID-19 would be a reason for the suspension. While the Utah Jazz player specifically sparked the initial action, the *underlying reason* was the virus itself.

The passage states: ""After the NBA decision, a Utah Jazz player was confirmed by tests to have contracted the COVID-19 virus.""  This directly links the NBA's concern to a Jazz player testing positive. While the other options mention Utah Jazz, only D is the exact information mentioned in the passage for the concern.

The passage states that ""aadhunika kridaka nikalas baekstroam ella kala golayata daekvu sahaya"", which translates to ""modern player Niklas Backstrom provided assistance to every goal"". While Ovechkin scored goals, the passage specifically mentions Backstrom's assistance in the game-winning goal.
"

Let's break down why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Baenkuva jaatikakarana kirimata pera shrimath richard braensange varjin grup baenkuvata lansuvak thabaa eya pratiksepa wee tibuni."" (Before the bank was nationalized, Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group made a bid for the bank, and it was rejected). Then, ""Varjin miladi gena aeththe nothern rok hi 'yahapat baenkuva' pamanak wana athara vatkam kalamanaakaranaya samagama nove."" (Virgin bought only the 'good bank' of Northern Rock, and not the asset management company.)
*   **Option A** is incorrect because Virgin did NOT buy the asset management company.
*   **Option B** is correct because while Virgin initially bid *before* nationalization, they only *bought* part of Northern Rock *after* nationalization (when it was separated into 'good bank' and 'bad bank').
*   **Option C** is incorrect because the passage does not say Virgin provided emergency assistance during the mortgage crisis. It mentions the bank needing it.
*   **Option D** is incorrect because the passage clearly states the first bid was made *before* nationalization.

kiyoto anumatha kirimen kumak sandaha haaniyak siduwanu aethaeyi kalin paewathi ostreliyanu rajaya vishwaasa kaleda?,"The correct answer is **B: rate aarthikaya**.

The passage states that the previous conservative government of Australia refused to ratify Kyoto, arguing that relying heavily on coal exports would harm the economy. Therefore, the former Australian government believed that ratifying Kyoto would harm the **rate aarthikaya (economy of the country)**.

Here's why:

* **The original text (P) focuses on:**
    * Supervising the palibodha mardana parikshanaya (pest control test) at Kota and evaluating its effectiveness in controlling palibodha.
    * Close supervision of the observers by rangers.
    * Collaborating with NSW and a sports organization to recruit suitable volunteers.
    * Providing safety training to selected volunteers.

* **The question (Q) asks:**
    * What does the pest control test NOT reflect immediately?

* **Analyzing the options:**
    * **A: eya waedasatahane palamu pareekshanaya baevin kisidu aegayeemak sidu noweeya (It will be the first test in the platform and there wont be any effect)** - is the most appropriate response as no effects will be seen since it is the first time being tested.

The other options describe aspects of the test setup but don't answer the question of immediate reflection.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, mema bedee yama soya gaththe kohenda?","The best answer is **B: fosilayak matha**.

The passage states that the study of a fossil (mema fosilaya matha padanamwa) suggests the split happened much earlier than expected based on genetic evidence. Therefore, the split was discovered through the study of a fossil. While the study was done by a researcher from the Ethiopian Rift Valley Research Service, the discovery itself came from the fossil.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, balaaporoththu wuwaata wadaa ikmanin sidu wuye kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: bedee yaema (bedee yaama)**.

The passage states: ""mema fosilaya matha padanamwa, emagin adahas wanne bedee yaama sidu wee aeththe anukamaya saakshya magin apeksa kalaata vadaa boho kaalayakata perathuva bavayi.""

This translates to: ""This fossil study implies that the split/divergence happened much earlier than expected based on genetic evidence.""

Therefore, the split/divergence (bedee yaama) happened earlier than expected.
"

**D: paalakayaa awakaashaya thula chalanaya kirima**

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Memagin kridakayinta upangaya avakaashaya thula chalanaya karamin vidiyo kridaavala kriyaa saha chalana paalanaya kirimata ida saelasei""
    *   This translates to: ""This allows the player to move within the created space and control actions and movements in video games.""
    *   This directly means the player moves the controller in space to control movements in the game.

Let's look at why the other options are not as correct:

*   **A: paalaka sanwedakaya konsolaya asala isthaanagatha kara aethi bawa thahawuru karagaeneema** - The passage states the motion is handled by the controller not necessarily setting up the console.
*   **B: aewaaye pihiteema thrimana gatha kirima** - The passage does not state this, but instead, that the controller uses the TV.
*   **C: owunge rupavaahiniya asala sanwaedaka thaebeema** - The passage is about the controller, not the TV."
rupavahini durasthayak lesa penena paridi nirmanaya kara aeththe kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: nintendo revolushan paalakaya**.

The passage states ""Rupavaahini durastha paalakayaka aaakaraye mema paalakaya,"" which translates to ""This controller is in the shape of a television remote.""  Therefore, the Nintendo Revolution controller is what is made to look like a TV remote.
"
sinhuvaa prawurththi ejansiyae nawathama waarthawae sandahan nowannae kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: guvan yaanaya urmki hi goda baesseya**.

Here's why:

* **P** states:
    * Initial report: Plane hijacked (Xinhua news agency)
    * Later report: Bomb threat, diverted to Afghanistan, landed in Kandahar
    * Earlier reports: Emergency landing in Urumqi rejected, therefore diverted to Afghanistan.

* **Q** asks: What is *not* mentioned in the *latest* Xinhua report?

The latest report (from P) mentions a bomb threat, diversion to Afghanistan, and landing in Kandahar. It *doesn't* mention the rejected emergency landing in Urumqi.

Therefore, the answer is B.
"
sinhuvaa prawurththi ejansiye mulma waarthawe sandahan nowunae kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: guvan yaanayata bomba tharjanayak aethi viya** (that the plane had a bomb threat).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Pasukaaleena vaarthaa inpasuva sandahan kale guvan yaanayata bomba tarjanayak aethi woo bawath..."" which translates to ""Later reports mentioned that the plane had a bomb threat...""
*   The question asks what was *not* mentioned in the *initial* Xinhua news report.

The first report mentioned:

*   The plane was scheduled to be hijacked.
*   Later, it was reported the plane had a bomb threat and was diverted to Afghanistan, landing in Kandahar.
*   Previous reports said the plane was diverted to Afghanistan due to a rejected emergency landing in Urumqi.

Therefore, the bomb threat was only mentioned in later reports, not the initial one."
guvanviduli waedasatahana atharathura saaraa daeniyas visin niwedanaya karana ladde kumakda?,"Let's break down the passage and the question to find the answer.

The passage describes the situation surrounding Bob Dylan winning the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2016. It focuses on the difficulty the Swedish Academy's Nobel Committee for Literature had in contacting him.

The question asks: What did Sara Danius announce during the radio program?

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: saahithyaya pilibanda nobel thyaaga jayagraahakayaa (The Nobel Prize in Literature winner)** - This is part of the context, but not the specific announcement Sara Danius made on the radio. She didn't announce *who* it was, but *what she was trying to do about contacting* the winner.

*   **B: kamituvata sahakaruwangen prathichaarayak nolaebuni (The committee did not receive a response from colleagues)** - This contradicts the passage. The passage says they *did* get a friendly response to their phone and email invitations through Dylan's closest associate.

*   **C: 2016 sahithyaya pilibanda nobel thyaagayata nirdesha wu nam (Names nominated for the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature)** - The passage doesn't discuss nominations or the process for how Bob Dylan was chosen as the winner of that year's Literature Nobel Prize.

*   **D: bob dilan samaga sambandha weemata darana uthsahaya kamituva visin nawathwanu aetha (The committee's effort to contact Bob Dylan will be stopped)** - This is the closest to the key information from the last sentence in the excerpt, ""daan api kisivak karamin nositimu. mama ohuge sameepathama sahakaruvaata durakathanayen kathaa kara, email kara aethi aamanthranayata ithaa suhada pilithuru laebby aetha. daenata eya nisaekavama pramaanavatya"" . That is, that the committee was successful in getting a friendly response.

Therefore, the answer is **B: kamituvata sahakaruwangen prathichaarayak nolaebuni (The committee did not receive a response from colleagues)** ."
sambandha kara gaeneemata nohaeki wuye kaawada?,"Based on the passage, the reason why contact couldn't be made directly was because attempts to reach **D: Bob Dylan** directly failed. The passage explicitly mentions that they tried to contact him through his closest associate and also through emails, and received a friendly response.
"

The passage states that ""Bushge maadhya pracaraka gordan jondrow... """"koreanu ardhadvipaya thula sanatha kala haeki lesa nyashtika aviharanaya kireema sandaha gath pradhaana piyavarak"""" bavayi.""  This means that Gordon Jondrow referred to the agreement regarding the Korean peninsula as an important step towards denuclearization.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: dvitheeyika bahalum kotasa dhaarithaawaya piree thibeema (the capacity of the secondary containment area being full):** The passage says it *wasn't* full.
*   **B: gini vidhaana paddhathiyae saamaan‍ya pareekshanayak (a normal inspection of the fire system):** While the incident started *after* a fire suppression system test, the crack was due to thermal expansion.
*   **D: fort greely pompaagaarawala ginnak (a fire at the Fort Greely pump station):** The passage doesn't mention a fire. The incident involved a release of oil after a fire suppression system test and power outage."

kaethrina suli kunatuva atharathura nawawana kottaasha kumakda?,"Let's analyze the provided text fragments and the question:

* **P:** Provides a description of an event involving flooding, damage, and water levels. It mentions ""Kathrina suli kunatuva atharathuradi"" (Hurricane Katrina aftermath). It says the water level rose 20 feet above the normal level and that in some places, the water level reached 100 feet.

* **Q:** Asks ""kaethrina suli kunatuva atharathura nawawana kottaasha kumakda?"" which translates to ""What was one consequence of Hurricane Katrina's aftermath?"".

Now let's examine the answer choices:

*   **A: ganvatura jala mattama adi 100 k palalata viya** - ""The water level in some places reached 100 feet."" This is directly supported by the text in P.
*   **B: ina dakva ihalata wu jalaya wellata udin uthuraa giyeya** - ""The water rising reached above the well."" This is a general statement about flooding, but not a primary consequence related to measurement.
*   **C: ganwathura jala mattama adi 20 k usata viya** - ""The water level rose 20 feet."" This also is mentioned, but less impactful than 100 feet.
*   **D: angal 6 ka varshaapathanaya paludu wee aethi wella binda daemeeya** - ""6 inches of rainfall damaged the well."" This is not the major consequence of Hurricane Katrina aftermath as described.

Choice A accurately represents a significant consequence of Hurricane Katrina's aftermath as described in the text.

**Therefore, the correct answer is A.**"

**B: wenath rogiyekuta vairasaya aasadanaya viya haeki sambhaavithawa**

Here's why:

The passage focuses on isolating the patient to prevent the spread of Ebola.  This implies that the primary concern of confirming whether Hamilton followed protocols is to minimize the risk of other patients becoming infected.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: rogiya gaman kala thaena (Where the patient traveled)** While travel history is relevant for identifying the source of the infection, it's not the immediate concern related to the protocols being followed.
*   **C: nisi neethi samudayan anugamanaya kara thibeda yanna (Whether the correct protocols were followed)** This is a broader question that the confirmation of Hamilton could verify, but ""B"" is the direct impact.
*   **D: rogiyage wathman thathwaya (The patient's current condition)** Patient's condition is of course important but the confirmation of Hamilton is to check protocols to prevent the *spread* of the disease.

Therefore, B is the most logically connected answer."

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses the possibility of comets bringing organic material (proteins, carbon-based substances) to Earth, which could have contributed to the origin of life.
*   It also mentions that cometary impacts long ago might help scientists understand how planets, especially Earth, were formed.
*   Therefore, understanding how the Earth was formed is a key question that scientists are trying to answer through studying comets."

The text states: ""Apadrawya parivahana trak ratha umage pivisuma avahira kireema sandaha yodaagat athara..."" which translates to ""While being used to block access to the hazardous material transport truck...""  Therefore, the access road was blocked (awuhira keruni).
"
mema chedayata anuwa chayaroopa shilpiya waahanaye haepeemata pera sidu nowuye kumakda?,"Let's analyze the passage and the options to determine what didn't happen *before* the photographer was hit by the vehicle.

*   **P:** The passage states that the photographer stopped his car on Sepulveda Boulevard, tried to take photos of a police stop *before* crossing the road. It also indicates that the traffic police asked him to move his car as he was obstructing traffic by taking photos. Finally, it says that he was hit by a vehicle.

Now let's examine the options:

*   **A: chayaroopa shilpiyata maargaye anek pasata aapasu yana lesa mahaa maarga ratha waahana polisiya visin niyoga karana ladee**: This translates to ""The highway traffic police ordered the photographer to return to the other side of the road"". The passage states that the police told him to move his car, implying that he was asked to move. This likely happened *before* he was hit.

*   **B: chayaroopa shilpiya thama waahanaya sepulwedaa boliward asala nawatha thaebeeya**: This translates to ""The photographer parked his vehicle near Sepulveda Boulevard"". The passage confirms this happened *before* the accident.

*   **C: chayaroopa shilpiya polis naewatheeme pinthura gaththeya**: This translates to ""The photographer took pictures of the police stop"". The passage says he *tried* to take pictures before crossing the road, but it doesn't confirm if he successfully took them *before* being hit.

*   **D: chayaroopa shilpiyata bibarge pinthurayak laba gaeneemata haeki viya**: This translates to ""The photographer was able to obtain a picture of Bieber"". The passage doesn't indicate that he was trying to take a photo of Bieber, so it is possible that it didn't happen *before* he was hit.

Considering the above, option **D** is the most likely answer. He was taking pictures of the police stop, not Bieber.

**Therefore, the correct answer is D.**"
waahanaye haepeemata pera chayaroopa shilpiya kirimata uthsaha kale kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: polis naewatheemaka chayaroopa gaeneema**.

This translates to: ""The photographer parked his vehicle on the other side of Sepulveda Boulevard and, **before crossing the road, tried to take photos of a police stop**...""

Therefore, the photographer was trying to take photos of a police stop before being hit by the vehicle.

Therefore, the answer is **B: ohuta ugure amaruwak aetha (He has a sore throat)** and **D: ohuta una rogaya aetha (He has a fever)**.

However, since only one answer can be chosen, and the question asks about a statement after the viral infection, **B is slightly better because the sore throat is explicitly mentioned in relation to the viral infection**. Option D only implies the presence of fever, which is also included in statement B.

So the correct answer is B

*   ""Although the President's condition is stable, he will be isolated at home for a few days.""
*   ""While I have a fever and sore throat, I am in good enough health to continue my duties via electronic messages.""
*   ""I expect to return to all my official duties next week.""

*   **Q (Possible Translations):**
    *   A: He does not have a fever.
    *   B: He will be staying at home for a few weeks.
    *   C: He is in good enough health to send electronic messages.
    *   D: He has a serious viral condition.

Based on the translated context:

*   **A: ohuta unak naetha (He does not have a fever.)** - The text says he *does* have a fever (""una saha ugurae amaaruva haerunu vita""). So, this is false.
*   **B: ohu sathi kihipayak niwase raendee sitinu aetha (He will be staying at home for a few weeks.)** - The text says ""dina kihipayak"" (a few days), not weeks. So, this is false.
*   **C: viduli sandesha kirimata tharam ohu honda sawukya thathwayen pasu we (He is in good enough health to send electronic messages.)** - The text directly states he is in good enough health to continue duties electronically (""viduli sandesha magin magae kaaryaya karagena yaamata mama manaa soukya thathvayen pasuwemi.""). So, this is **true**.
*   **D: ohuta daruni vairas thathwayak aetha (He has a serious viral condition.)** - The text says ""mrudu roga thathvayak"" (a mild illness), not a serious one. So, this is false.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C**."

*   Q asks when the cyclone Gonu would be expected to weaken according to the information provided.

**B: sulan wegaya paeyata kilomeetara 83 dakwa pahatha waetunu vita** is the most accurate answer. The text specifically mentions the expectation of it weakening to 83 km/h.

Let's analyze why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: maaladiwayinata langaa weemata pera** - It is weakening while approaching the Maldives but there is more information in another answer
*   **C: ehi uchchathama awasthaawata langaa weemata pera** - The passage states it was expected to weaken *as* it approached the Maldives, not *before* reaching its peak.
*   **D: sulan wegaya paeyata saethapum 149 dakwa langaa weemata pera** - The passage states it was expected to weaken to winds of 83 km/h. 149 mph is its peak wind speed.

Therefore, **B** is the best answer."

* **P:** States that Gonu at its highest stage had wind speeds up to 240 kilometers per hour (149 miles per hour).
* **Q:** Asks what the wind speed was at Gonu's highest stage.

The text in P directly provides the answer: 240 kilometers per hour is equivalent to 149 miles per hour.

Therefore the correct answer is **C: paeyata saethapum 149**

kaereniya breevis wala lakshanayak lesa nosaelakenne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: eya bahu saileeya we**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that *Karenia brevis* is a *single-celled* (aeka sailika) marine organism.**  ""Bahu saileeya"" means ""multi-celled"". Therefore, being multi-celled is *not* a characteristic of *Karenia brevis* according to the passage.
* The other options ARE characteristics of Karenia brevis as stated in the passage:
    * **A: eya aelgee wargayaki** (it is a type of algae) - Directly stated.
    * **B: eyata minisunge snaayu akreeya kala haekiya** (it can paralyze human nerves) - It produces neurotoxins.
    * **D: meya swabhavikawa sidu we** (this happens naturally) - The passage discusses natural factors leading to blooms.
"
kaereniya breevis hata kala nohaekke pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"Based on the passage, the following can be inferred about Karenia brevis:

*   **A: Maths‍yayinge snaayu akreeya kirima (Inhibiting the nervous system of fish):** The passage explicitly states that the algae produces a neurotoxin that affects the nervous systems of fish.
*   **D: Snaayu visha weemak nipadaweema (Producing a nerve toxin):** The passage also clearly mentions the algae produces a neurotoxin.
*   **C: Jalayata balapaem kirima (Affecting the water):** The passage discusses how the concentration of the algae in the water becomes unusually high, and this leads to fish dying. The wind can carry the affected water and cause problems for people.

Therefore, the correct answer is all three options are correct, so options A, C, and D describe things Karenia brevis does that are mentioned in the passage.

However, the best answer here is **B: onaema thathwayak yatathe wegayen wardhanaya weema (Rapidly growing under any condition)** because it is the MOST inclusive answer that describes the root cause of the others. The algae only creates toxins because it is growing uncontrollably due to favorable conditions. Thus, options A, C and D all occur because of option B.

Therefore, the best answer is:

**B: onaema thathwayak yatathe wegayen wardhanaya weema**

This supports B.

Let's examine why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: ehi prathiphalayak wu warshapathanaya owahu hata prayojanawath viya** - While the passage mentions rainfall being described as ""beneficial,"" the question asks for a statement about the *hurricane itself*, not its effects.
*   **C: boho doopath wala warshapathanaya daknata laebeeya** -The passage does say ""Bohomayak divayin puravata ehi ithiri thathwayen vaesi aethivu athara"" which means that many islands received rainfall from the remnants of it but, this answer doesn't focus on the hurricane Felicia itself.
*   **D: samahara waesi akunu samaga viya** - While the passage mentions rain and lightning, the original question asks about hurricane Felicia, not simply rain and lightning in general."

The passage explicitly states ""Pikae juniyar 2009 hangaeriyaanu gron pri tharangayaen pasu ivath karana ladhi"" which translates to ""Piquet Jr. was removed after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix"".

Therefore, the crash happened *after* Alonso's service stop.

Now let's examine the options:

*   A: Immediately after Alonso's pit stop (Aelonsoge sewa naewathumata pasu wahama) - **This seems to align with the information in the paragraph.**
*   B: While other cars were refueling (anek motar ratha indhana purawamin sitiya dee) - This is irrelevant to the timing of the accident.
*   C: Before the safety car came out (Aarakshitha motar rathaya eliyata paemineemata pera) - The text says the crash happened due to the safety car deployment.
*   D: After Piquet went in for fuel (pikat indhana piraweema sandaha giya pasu) - The text mentions that crash occurred after Alonso's service stop and due to safety car depolyment not after piquet went for fuel.

The statement ""eya siduwanne """"nirmanasheelee"""" yaeyi saelakena nagarawala pamani"" (It only happens in cities that are considered ""creative"") is not directly supported by the passage. It implies Bucharest is trying to be creative, but doesn't say the festival ONLY happens in ""creative"" cities.

II-76s bhaavithaya athhituweemata rusiyawata hethu wuye kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: anathurak (an accident)**

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""pasugiya maasayae rusiyaavaehi dhee barapathala anathurak aethi wee aetha"" (last month there was a major accident in Russia).
*   It then mentions a specific accident where an engine fell off during a flight.
*   Finally, it says ""aema anathuraen pasu rusiyaava tika kaalayakata il-76s yaanaa piyaasara kireema nathara kalaeya"" (after that accident Russia temporarily stopped IL-76s flights).

This clearly indicates the accident (anathurak) was the reason for Russia to halt the usage of IL-76s.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   Abhyanthara hamudawa (internal army) and soviyat hamudawa (soviet army): The passage mentions both, but not as the reason for halting flights.
*   Vibhaaga wemin pawathina vimarshanayak (an investigation underway): The investigation is happening *because* of the accident, not the other way around."

* The passage goes on to criticize those who write ""asaarthaka woo bhava flook liyuvaeya"" (worthless sentimental/emotional stories) related to it, instead of discussing important topics like ""Upath paalana aushadha, vaidyamaya washayaen athyavashya daeval laesa saelakimata polambawamin"" (the price of necessary items such as medicines for childcare and medical treatment).

Therefore, the passage implies that Kaanthavan avoids openly talking about **women's well-being**.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, wadaathma gathikathawayakk dakwanne kumana graha wasthuwa da?","The correct answer is **A: pruthuwiya**.

The passage clearly states: ""apa dannaa tharamata, taytanta vadaa gathikathvayak penwana graha vasthuvak aethae ekak pamani, ehi nama pruthuwiyay."" (As far as we know, there is only one planetary object that shows more dynamism than Titan, its name is Earth/Pruthuwiya).
"
vinivida penena diyarayak sahitha ganga saha vil handunaagena aeththe kumana graha wasthuwaka da?,"The correct answer is **B: Tayitan**.

The passage mentions ""Eya jalaya maen vinivida paeney"" (Its water is transparent). Then it says if you were sitting on the banks you could see through it. Then it mentions that only Earth has more gravity than Titan. Therefore, the river with transparent water is on Titan."
pihatu soyagaeneeme prathiphalayak nowanne mema soyagaeneem walin kawareda?,"Let's analyze the passage and the options:

*   The passage explicitly mentions that the discovery helps understand the color of the feathers (""varnaya waeni visthara da saepayae""). So, option A is incorrect.
*   The passage states that the feather structure suggests they were used for thermoregulation or display, *not* for flying (""Eva piyaembimata nova ushnathwaya niyaamanaya kirimata ho paenwimata yodaagath bhava pihaatuvala vyuhaya magin penwanu labei""). So, option B is incorrect as the passage helps understand the feathers were not used for flight.
*   The passage says that the discovery provides insight into the evolution of feathers (""maema soyaagaeneema pakshingae pihaatuvala parinaamaya sambandhayaen da avabodhayak labaa dei""). So, option C is incorrect.
*   The passage mentions ""Meyin, daenatamath prasidha woo nyaayayak wana samahara dynosaravalata pihaatu thibunu bhava sanaatha kireema pamanak nova"", which translates to ""Not only does it confirm the now well-known theory that many dinosaurs had feathers..."" So, the passage confirm that many dinosaurs had feathers. So, option D is correct.

**Therefore, the correct answer is D: boho dynosarayanta pihatu thiboo bawa thahawuru kirima.**
"
dynosarayange pihatu wala nothibune kumakda?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: prakshaya**.

The text states: ""Dynosar pihaatuvala hondin vardhitha praakshayak laesa haedinvena dandak nomaeti namuth..."" which translates to ""Dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft (prakshaya) like a reed-like stem...""
"
ZMApp pilibandawa sathya nowanne pahatha sandahan prakaashayangen kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: eyata pawathina asadana walata prathikara kala haeki namuth maranaya walakwa gaeneemata eyata haekiyawak naetha** (It can treat existing infections but doesn't have the ability to prevent death).

Here's why:

*   **A: eya prathideha walin saedee aetha (It is made of antibodies):** The passage states ""Ek pratidaeha mishrakala paanayak wana ZMapp"" which translates to ""ZMapp is an antibody cocktail"". So, this statement is true.
*   **C: eya PALM athhada baeleemedee paalithayak lesa kaaryabharayak itu kaleya (It acted as a control in the PALM trial):** The passage states ""PALM athhadaa baelimaedee ZMapp paalithayak laesa salakanu labini"", which translates to ""In the PALM trial, ZMapp was considered a control."" So, this statement is true.
*   **D: adhyayanawalin heli wee aeththe ehi prathilaabha mulin sithuwata wadaa adu bawayi (Studies revealed that its benefits are less than initially thought):** The passage mentions that while ZMapp showed some promise in the field, formal studies showed it had a lower impact on mortality rates than hoped for. So, this statement is true.

The statement that is *not* completely true, and therefore the correct answer, is **B**. While ZMapp showed some promise to treat existing infections, the passage states that it had a lower impact on mortality rates than hoped for in studies. Therefore, it is more accurate to say that it could not reliably prevent death from the disease.
"
PALM athhada baeleema niwaeradiwa visthara karanne pahatha sandahan prakaashawalin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: paalaka awshadhayak wenath prathikaara thunak samaga sansandanaya karana lada athara in ekak ZMApp viya**

Here's why:

*   The original text states that ""PALM athhadaa baelimaedee ZMapp paalithayak laesa salakanu labini, enam vidyaagnayo eya padanamak laesa salakaa, waenath prathikaara thunak samaga sansandanaya kaloya."" This translates to ""In the PALM trial, ZMapp was considered a control, meaning scientists used it as a study and compared it with three other treatments.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: adhyayanawalin heli wee aeththe eya kalin sithuwata wadaa waedi prathilaabha laba gatha haeki bawayi (studies have revealed that it is possible to obtain more benefits than previously thought)** The text implies the opposite for ZMapp itself, stating that previous studies showed it had less effect than expected. It is stated that PALM trial is doing a study among three treatments to find a better solution, not that ZMapp is better than previously thought.
*   **C: ZMapp athhada baeleema sandaha moolika padanamak lesa bhaavitha kerini (ZMapp was used as the basic study for the trial)**. While PALM is a trial and ZMapp is considered the control for the trial, the literal translation of this choice indicates that ZMapp was used as the basis for the whole trial, which is not exactly reflected in the source.
*   **D: pawathnaa thathwayanta piliyam kirimedee eya phaladayee bawa oppu wee aetha (It has been proven to be effective in treating the existing condition)** The text explicitly states that there is no proven effective treatment and that ZMapp showed only limited promise but ultimately didn't meet expectations in previous formal studies."
nawa chipaya wadaathma waedagath wanu aeththe kohedaeyi paryeshakayan sithanne da?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: adu aadayamlaabhee ratawal**.

The passage explicitly states that the new chip can help identify diseases like cancer, tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria in **low-income countries**, where patients have a lower chance of survival compared to wealthier nations due to these diseases. This highlights the chip's intended use and importance in low-income settings.
"
dosha nirnaya kirime upakaranaya godanaengeema sandaha kumana kramawedaya bhaavitha karayi da?,"The correct answer is **B: saaman‍ya inkjet mud‍rana yanthrayak** (a common inkjet printer).

The passage explicitly states the device can be printed using a ""saamaanya inkjaet mudrana yanthrayakin"" (common inkjet printer).
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, sakhanditha mohora pilibanda sathya nowanne kumana prakaashaya da?","Let's break down the question and the provided text to find the correct answer.

**Understanding the question:**

The question asks: ""According to the text, which statement about *sakhanditha mohora* is NOT true?""

**Analyzing the Text (P):**

This text is very difficult to parse without knowing the original language and the intended meaning.  However, we can extract some key phrases and potential relationships:

*   ""Vidyaagnayo, sada ithaa saemin haekili yaama mangin aethi woo bhava paenaena sada mathupita visiri aethi **sakhanditha mohora** laesa haedinvaena bhurupa soyaaagena aetha."" - This appears to be an introduction or explanation of what *sakhanditha mohora* is. It mentions ""Vidyaagnayo,"" ""haekili yaama"" (possibly related to ""chedayata anuwa"" in Q), ""mathupita visiri"" (surface scattering), and being ""found"" or ""searched for"".
*   ""Sada puraa visira pawathina maema mohora avama washayaen viyaeki goss pawathina baevin evaa saapekshava maethakadi sidu woo bhuvidyaathmaka siddhin bhava penvay."" - This suggests *sakhanditha mohora* are related to scattering, relative events, and geological events that have happened recently.
*   ""maema nyaaya chandrayaa boo vidyaathmaka kriyaakaarakam valin sampurnayaenma baehaerava aethi bavata karana prakaashayata patahaeni wae."" -  This links *sakhanditha mohora* to the moon (""chandrayaa"") and related science or activity.

**Analyzing the Options (Q):**

*   **A: ewa nirmanaya karana lada siduweem maethakadee sidu wee thibeemata ida aetha** (There is a possibility that the events that created them have happened recently). This seems consistent with the text, which mentions ""maethakadi sidu woo"" (recently happened).
*   **B: ema siduweem walin adahas wanne chand‍rayage bhoo goleeya kriyakareethwayangen aduwak nopawathina bawayi** (These events mean that there is no decrease in the moon's global activities).  The text doesn't directly support this statement. It talks about events and processes, but doesn't imply *increased* or *maintained* global activity.
*   **C: samahara vita eya chand‍rayage haekileeme prathiphalayak viya haekiya** (Sometimes it could be a result of the moon's hacking). This aligns with text, as ""haekili"" is mentioned.
*   **D: ewayin bohomayak sanda mathupita hamu noweeya** (Many of them are not found on the surface of the moon). The initial sentence in P says ""*sada mathupita visiri aethi sakhanditha mohora*,"" which implies they *are* scattered on the surface.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, option **D** contradicts the initial description in the text that ""*sakhanditha mohora* are scattered on the surface."" Therefore, the statement that is NOT true is:

**D: ewayin bohomayak sanda mathupita hamu noweeya** (Many of them are not found on the surface of the moon)

Therefore the answer is **D**."
"mema chedayata anuwa, chand‍raya matha bhoo vid‍yathmaka kriyaakaarakam siduwana bawata penwana bhoo haedayan pilibanda n‍yaya wanne kumakda?","Based on the provided texts, the most logical answer is:

**D: mema bhoo haedayan tharamak maethakadee nirmanaya wee aetha (This Earth phenomenon was created somewhat recently)**

Here's why:

* **The prompt (Q) asks what the reasoning/logic is behind the Earthly phenomena happening due to the moon's influence.**
* **The text (P) mentions:**
    *  ""Sada ithaa saemin haekili yaama mangin aethi woo bhava paenaena"" (This hints at something happening *now* due to the moon's activity)
    * ""saapekshava maethakadi sidu woo bhuvidyaathmaka siddhin"" (relatevly recently happening earth phenomena)

The other options are less likely:

* **A: sanda semen haekilemin pawathee (The moon always exists while semen is hacked)**  This might be a literal translation, but likely not relevant to the question.
* **B: mema bhoo haedayan boho kalakata pera nirmanaya wee aetha (This Earth phenomenon was created a long time ago)** This contradicts the text which implies something recent.
* **C: chand‍raya mathupita bhoo haedayan awama pramaanayaka pawathee (Earth phenomena related to the moon exist in minimal quantities)** This isn't explicitly supported by the text.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, adhichodanaa gonu karana thek thawath sidu nowanu aeththe kumak da?","Based on the passage, the answer is **B: chayaroopa prasiddha kirima (photograph publication)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that publishing photographs in court proceedings is common in the rest of the UK but viewed with disfavor in Scottish law. Professor Pamela Ferguson highlights the dangers of publishing photographs of accused persons to the media.
*   The passage discusses the consequences and concerns of publishing photographs related to the court case.
*   The other options are not explicitly mentioned as things that would no longer happen.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **B**."
"mema chedayata anuwa, seel masun dadayam karannanta warthamana gaetaluwak nowanne kumak da?","The correct answer is **B: ayis praamanaya** (ice quantity).

Here's why:

The passage states that, according to Pitman, this year is exceptional.  It has the ""largest and thickest sea ice volume"" in the last 15 years, particularly regarding seal hunting.  This implies that the *quantity* of ice is *not* a problem for seal hunters right now; in fact, it's the opposite - there's *more* ice than usual.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: daedi kaalaguna thaththwayan (severe climate conditions):** The first sentence states that the current climate conditions hinder efforts to accurately gauge the ice. So, climate conditions *are* a potential problem.
*   **C: ayis wala ghanakama (ice thickness):** The passage highlights that the ice thickness is at its greatest in the past 15 years, thus, thickness isn't a problem, but an advantage.
*   **D: ayis unu weema (ice melting):** The passage does not directly mention if melting ice is a problem. However, the mention of how voluminous and thick the ice is in the last 15 years, implies that the rate of melting would at least be less of an issue than in the last 15 years.

Therefore, the *amount* of ice (ayis praamanaya) is not a current problem for seal hunters according to the passage."
"ayis walata amatharawa, beraa gaeneeme prayathnawalata thawath balapanne kumakda?","Based on the provided text, the answer is **B: kaalaguna thaththwayan**.

The passage states: ""Kaedaena ayisvalata amatarava, **daedi kaalaguna thathwayan da beraa gaeneeme prayathnavalata baadhaa wee aetha**."" This directly translates to ""In addition to the Canadian ice, **strong climate conditions also hinder rescue efforts**.""

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: pramaanawath saepayumak nomaethi weema (Lack of adequate resources)**: The passage doesn't specifically mention a lack of resources impeding rescue efforts, except indirectly through the hindrance of climate conditions.
*   **C: pramaanawath udaw nomaethikama (Lack of adequate help)**: The passage doesn't mention a lack of help specifically.
*   **D: seel masun dadayam karannan (Seal hunters)**: While the passage mentions seal hunting, it's in the context of the ice sheet's thickness and doesn't directly relate to hindering rescue efforts."
robarts thahawuru kirimen waelakee sitiye kumana vishwaasayada?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: pawudgalikathwayata aethi ayithiya** (the right to privacy).

The last sentence clearly states: ""Roy tiranaya mata randha paewathi paudgalikathwayata aethi gamyamaana ayitiya thamaa visvaasa kala bavada ohu thahavuru kale ya.""  This translates to: ""He affirmed that he believed in the clear right to privacy, which was held by the Roe decision.""

Therefore, Robarts confirmed his belief in the right to privacy.
"
saakachcha kirimata ithamath sadaachaara virodhee yaeyi robarts haegune kumana maathrukawada?,"Based on the passage, Roberts strongly rejected stating when life begins or when one believes it begins. He considered it unethical to express opinions on the specifics of such events, citing the decorum regarding abortions. Therefore, the most accurate answer is:

**D: nadu wala visheshitha karunu** (Specific facts of lawsuits/cases)

The passage implies that discussing the specifics of when life begins within the context of cases (nadus) related to abortion is what he deemed unethical. The other options are related, but D directly addresses the core of his objection.
"
aaloka kadambha deka baebalenne koheda?,"The correct answer is **A: ahasa desata** (to the sky).

The passage states: ""Aaloka kadamba dekak raathri kalaye ihala ahasata ella wana lesa sakasaa aetha."" This translates to ""Two beams of light were arranged to project high into the sky at night.""
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, mema sthaanaye nawa us godanaegili idi karanu laebuwe kawadada?","The correct answer is **D: idikirim katayuthu sidu wemin pawathee**.

The passage states that ""nava us godaenagili pahak, pravaahana madyasthaanayak saha madyaye smarana udyaanayak sandaha wana idikireem katayutu sidu keremin pawathee"" which translates to ""construction work for five new high-rise buildings, a transportation center and a memorial park in the middle is underway"". This clearly indicates that the construction is ongoing.

"mema chedayata anuwa, saekakaru pilibanda sathya nowana prakaashaya wanne kawareda?","Let's analyze the provided text and the options:

* **P (Text Analysis):**
    *  A three-wheeled vehicle was driven into a crowd.
    *  The individual who caused an explosion was injured in the explosion.
    *  He is a member of the Uyghur community, but authorities do not know his name.

* **Q (Question):**
    *  According to this incident, which statement about the suspect is **false**?

Now, let's evaluate the options:

*   **A: ohu prahaaraya atharathura waahanayak bhaavitha kaleya (He used a vehicle in the attack):**  The text states he drove a three-wheeled vehicle into a crowd. This is TRUE.

*   **B: ohu pupurana d‍ravyayak pupuruwa haeriya bawata chodanaa kere (He is accused of exploding an explosive):** The text clearly states that the individual caused an explosion. This is TRUE.

*   **C: ohuge janawargikathwaya baladhaareenta dannaa karunaki (His ethnicity is known to the authorities):** The text explicitly says authorities do NOT know his name, and the statement ""ohu uyigar jana kandaayame saamaajikayeku bhava misa ohuge nama thawamath baladhaarin nodani""  implies that while he *is* a member of the Uyghur community, his identity is unknown to authorities. This is FALSE.

*   **D: ohu thuwala nolaebeeya (He was not injured):** The text states ""pipirimen thuwala labaa randava ganu laebiya"" which translates to he was injured in the explosion. This is FALSE.

The question asks for the statement that is *false*. Both C and D are false. The best answer between the two would be option **C**. The statement ""ohu thuwala nolaebeeya (He was not injured)"" is directly refuted in the text.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D**.
"
prahaaraya sambandhayen baladhaareen thahawuru kara aethi thorathuru monawada?,"The correct answer is **B: saekakaruge janawargikathwaya (the attacker's ethnicity)**

Here's why:

Bombaya pupuruva haerime saekayata bhaajanaya woo pudgalaya pipirimen thuwala labaa randava ganu laebiya. Ohu uyigar jana kandaayame saamaajikayeku bhava misa ohuge nama thawamath baladhaarin nodani.**

    This translates to: ""A man is accused of driving a three-wheeled vehicle laden with explosives into a crowd. The individual who detonated the bomb was injured in the explosion and is in custody. It is suspected that he is a member of the Uyghur ethnic group, but his name is not yet known to the authorities.""

*   **Q: prahaaraya sambandhayen baladhaareen thahawuru kara aethi thorathuru monawada?**

    This translates to: ""What details have the authorities confirmed regarding the attack?""

Based on the text, the authorities have confirmed or at least suspect the attacker's ethnicity (Uyghur). They have *not* confirmed:

*   **A: siyalu sahayakayinge anan‍yathawa** (the identities of all accomplices) - The passage doesn't mention accomplices.
*   **C: prahaaraya pitupasa aethi abhipreranaya** (the motivation behind the attack) - The passage doesn't state the motivation.
*   **D: saekakaruge palamu saha awasana nama** (the attacker's first and last name) - The passage explicitly says the name is unknown.

Therefore, the only confirmed (or strongly suspected) detail is the ethnicity."

* **D: saaman‍ya aakalpaya naewatha laba gaeneema** is also directly mentioned: ""dumriya sthaanaye saamanya aakalpaya nawatha labaa ganna ladi""

The other options are also correct but ""vibhramanekshayak pawathwa gaeneema"" and ""saaman‍ya aakalpaya naewatha laba gaeneema"" are the most important, ""karadara pahatha"".

"mema chedayata anuwa, abhyawakasha madyasthaana meheyume aramuna kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: ahimi wu vibhramanekshayak soya gaeneema**

Here's why:

The other options are incorrect because:

*   B:  The passage states they are protected *from* Sekasum terapanayangen, not trying to get near.
*   C: It mentions reaching the end of space travel but that's not the primary *aim* of operating the space center.
*   D: The passage describes activating the jet airplane, but again, that's an action taken *during* the overall operation, not the operation's main objective.
"
mema naduwa pilibandawa sathya nowanne pahatha sandahan prakaashawalin kawareda?,"Let's break down the information given and analyze the options.

**Analysis of P:**

*   The text states a lawsuit (nadu pawaranu laebuwe) was filed against AOL (eya chodana gonukala pramukha pele antharjaala sevaa saepayumkaruveku wana aol).
*   The reason for the lawsuit includes unsolicited emails (ayaachitha thaepael laebeema).
*   The text suggests AOL was found guilty of creating a situation where unsolicited emails became a problem.
*   This happened in 2003

**Analysis of Options:**

*   **A: e. o. el moolasthaanaya pihita aethi pranthaye eyata erehiwa nadu pawaranu laebuwe ya.** (A lawsuit was filed against it in the region where e. o. el's headquarters are located)  The passage doesn't provide any information about the location of the lawsuit or AOL's headquarters.  We can't confirm or deny this from the text.

*   **B: waradakaruweku karana ladee** (Was found guilty) The text implies AOL was found guilty.

*   **C: mema naduwedee ayaachitha thaepael pilibanda neethi bhaavitha karana ladee** (Unsolicited email laws were used in this lawsuit) The lawsuit was about unsolicited emails, it's reasonable to assume that the existing laws against unsolicited email were used.

*   **D: e. o. el hata chodanaa gonu karana ladee** (E. O. EL has been charged with lawsuits) This statement doesn't align with the passage, which is about a case against AOL.

**The Question: mema naduwa pilibandawa sathya nowanne pahatha sandahan prakaashawalin kawareda?** (Which of the following statements is NOT true about this case?)

Considering the analysis above, **Option A** is the one most likely to be untrue. The passage doesn't provide any information to either support or contradict the claim about the location of the lawsuit, so we can't say if it's true. B and C are implied as truths in the document, and D directly contradicts it.

**Answer:**

Therefore, the answer is **A**.
"
mema naduwa niwaeradiwa visthara karanne pahatha sandahan prakaashayangen kawareda?,"Let's break down the given information and analyze the statements to determine the correct answer.

Here's a summary of what we can understand from paragraph P:

*   **Subject:** The case involves an alleged violation of Virginia law against spam.
*   **Defendant:** A major internet service provider (ISP) that provides internet services; specifically AOL.
*   **Claim:** Unsolicited emails (spam) being sent to users
*   **Initiation:** The case was filed in 2003.
*   **Purpose:** To establish a system to prevent unsolicited emails.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

*   **A: e. o. el hata illum nokala bedahaereema sambandhayen chodanaa ella viya:** (E.O.L faced charges regarding unwanted email) -  This aligns with the details mentioned in paragraph P about the lawsuit being about spam.

*   **B: mema naduwata pramukha pele antharjala sewa sapayannan dedeneku sambandhaya:** (Two major internet service providers are involved in this case) -  The passage specifically mentions AOL as the defendant; no other major ISP is mentioned. So, this is incorrect.

*   **C: 2003 dee naduwa pawaranu laebeeya:** (The case was filed in 2003) - This is directly stated in the text.

*   **D: e. o. el mema naduwa paewareema aarambha kaleya:** (EOL initiated filing the lawsuit) - The passage doesn't mention who started the case, only that AOL is being sued for spam. The beginning of the trial is not discussed.

Therefore, the correct answers are A and C. Since the instructions say to choose only one, you should choose the most representative answer, which in this case would be **C: 2003 dee naduwa pawaranu laebeeya** as it directly mentions the details of the case.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, vidaal meeta waara thunakata pera kreedaa kirimata patan gaththe kumana samajaya sandahada?","The correct answer is **A: seweelaa**.

The passage states ""vaara tunakata pera sevila wethin barka ha ek viya"" which translates to ""Three seasons ago he joined Barca from Sevilla"".  This means prior to joining Barcelona (Barca), he played for Sevilla.
"

ema tharagaye prathiwadee kandaayama wuye kawuda?,"The correct answer is **B: boloniya**.

The text states: ""Boloniyata erehiva iridaa paewaethweemata niyamithawa thibu tharagayakata pera ohu kandaayam hotelaye naewathee sitiyeya."" which translates to ""Before the match scheduled to be held on Sunday against Bologna, he was staying at the team hotel."" This clearly indicates that the opposing team for that match was Bologna.
"
jark hotalaye naewathee sitiye aeyi?,"The correct answer is **C: ohu irida tharagayak thibuni (he had a Sunday match)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""Boloniyaavata erehiva iridaa paewaethweemata niyamithawa thibu tharagayakata pera ohu kandaayam hotelaye naewathee sitiyeya."" This translates to ""He was staying at the team hotel before a match that was scheduled to be played on Sunday against Bologna.""

Therefore, the reason Jark was staying at the hotel was because he had a match on Sunday.
"

The passage states: ""jakarthaa bhugoliya bhautika niyojitaayatanaya pawasana paridi, **kampanaya 6.5 pramaanaye awashyathaava nosapurana baevin sunaami anaturu aengavim kisivak nikuth nokerana bavayi.**""

This translates to: ""Jakarta Geophysical Agency did not issue any tsunami warning because the threshold of 6.5 magnitude earthquake requirement was not met.""

Therefore, the reason the Jakarta Geophysical Agency did not issue a warning is that the earthquake didn't meet the magnitude requirement of 6.5.
"
"ema chedayata anuwa, bhoomikampawa nisa aethi wuye kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: Sunaami tharjanayak (A Tsunami threat)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sunaami tarjanayak nomaeti vuvat, nevasikayin santraasayata path wee ovunge vyaapara saha nivaasa valin pita weemata patan gathha."" This translates to: ""Even though there was a tsunami threat, the residents became frightened and started to leave their businesses and homes.""
* **The question asks:** ""Ema chedayata anuwa, bhoomikampawa nisa aethi wuye kumakda?"" This translates to: ""According to that passage, what happened because of the earthquake?""
* **Therefore, the earthquake (implied by the mention of needing a magnitude of 6.5) led to a tsunami threat.**

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: Santhrasayata path pradeshawaseen (Frightened residents):** While the residents were frightened, the direct result of the earthquake was the *threat* of a tsunami. The fear was a consequence of the threat.
* **C: Nikuth karana lada anathuru aengaweemak (Issued a danger warning):** The passage mentions the *lack* of an effective warning for a tsunami following an earthquake of a certain magnitude.
* **D: 6.5 ka vishaalathwa parimanayak (Magnitude of 6.5):** This is simply a measure of the earthquake's size, not a direct outcome of it.
"
me atharin suryayage saha anekuth tharakawala kriyakareethwayata hethu wanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: bhramanaya saha deepthiya**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the functionality of all stars in the system is nothing other than what is governed by their brightness and their rotation (""evaaye diptiya saha evaye karakaevima magin paalanaya kerena bhava handunaa ladi"").

The passage explicitly mentions brightness (deepthiya) and rotation (bhramanaya) as factors governing the activity of stars. Therefore, C is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
tharakawaka rosbi ankaya theeranaya wanne keseda?,"The passage states: ""Tharuvaka plasma pravaahayata adaala wana rosby ankaya tirana kirimata diptiya saha bramanaya ekva bhavitha kere."" This translates to: ""To determine the Rossby number related to the plasma flow of a star, luminosity and rotation are used together.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: deepthiya saha bhramanaya** (luminosity and rotation).

Although other parties may also be concerned, the question asks who *expressed* their concern according to the passage, and the passage only says that the post office did."

Here's why:

*   The passage directly quotes the Governor saying, """"mema siduweema barapathalayi."" (""This incident is serious."") Option D directly contradicts this statement.

Let's look at the other options:

*   A: ""mema kriya piliwela hondin kriyathmaka we"" (""this action plan is working well"") -The passage says, ""apage kriyaa piliwela kriyaatmaka wana bavatat, viya yuthu bavatat sahatikayi,"" which means they are making sure their action plan is effective and will be implemented.
*   B: ""mahajana aarakkshaa thahawuru kirima sandaha awashya piyawara ganimin sitee"" (""taking the necessary steps to ensure public safety"") - The Governor confirmed that steps were being taken to protect public safety (""mahajana aarakshava suraekimata piyavara gene thibu bavata ohu teksas hi vaesiyanta thahavuru kaleya"").
*   C: ""abhiyogayata muhuna deeme haekiyawa owunta aetha"" (""they have the ability to face the challenge"") - The Governor said, """"mema naduve aethi woo abhiyogayata muhuna deemata vadaa hondin sannaddha woo sthaana athalossak lokaye aetha"""" (""There are few places in the world better prepared to face the challenges that this incident presents"").

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""apata daan maasa 4k vayasaeti diyavaediyaven pelunu namuth daan diyavaediyava nomaeti meeyek aetha..."" This directly translates to ""We have a 4-month-old mouse that had diabetes but now does not have diabetes..."" This supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **A: mema prathiphala palamu aakaraye diyawaediyawa aethi rogeenta prayojanawath viya haekiya:** The passage explicitly states that the findings do not yet provide any relief for people with type 1 diabetes.
*   **C: ohu mema soyagaeneem prathikarayakata maga penviya haeki bawa subhawadee we:** While Professor Ur is hopeful, the passage also mentions that he, like other experts, expresses skepticism about the possibility of curing diabetes and states that this finding does not offer any solution to people already suffering from type 1 diabetes.
*   **D: samahara diyawaediyawa nothiboo meeyanta daen diyawaediyawa aetha:** The passage focuses on a mouse that *used* to have diabetes, but no longer does. It doesn't mention any mice that newly developed diabetes."
"ema chedayata anuwa, aachaarya ur saeka pala karanne kumak gaenada?","The correct answer is **B: prathikarayak viya haekida yana bawa (Whether it can be a cure)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Anekuth visheshagnayan samaharak denaa menma, ohuda diyavaediyaava suva kireeme haekiyaawa pilibandava saeka pahala karanne..."" This translates to ""Like some other specialists, he also expresses doubt about the possibility of curing diabetes...""
*   Therefore, Aachaarya Ur is expressing doubt about whether diabetes can be cured.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   A: Aachaarya Ur specifically notes that this discovery DOES NOT offer any relevance to people currently living with type 1 diabetes.
*   C: The passage does mention the opinions of other specialists, but the direct question asks what *Aachaarya Ur* is expressing doubt about.
*   D: The passage focuses on the possibility of a cure for diabetes, not the long-term state of non-diabetic mice."
CG4684 guvan yaanaya anathurata lakweema niwaeradiwa visthara nokaranne pahatha sandahan prakaashawalin kawareda?,"Let's break down the original text (P) and each statement to find the correct answer.

*   **P (Original Text):** The Twin Otter aircraft flight CG4684 was attempting to land at Kokoda but had to abort the first attempt due to bad weather. It disappeared about ten minutes before its scheduled second landing attempt. The crash site has been found, and due to the difficulty in reaching the site, two police officers were deployed into the jungle to search for survivors. The bad weather that caused the aborted landing also affected the search efforts.

Now let's analyze each option:

*   **A: guvan yaanaya mula dee ayahapath kaalagunaya nisa godabaemata nohaeki viya (The plane was initially unable to land due to bad weather):** This is **TRUE**. The text explicitly states the first landing attempt was aborted due to bad weather.
*   **B: yaanaya itha dura baehaera sthaanayaka kadaa waetuni (The plane crashed in a very remote location):** This is **TRUE**. The text indicates it's difficult to reach the crash site, leading to police officers needing to go into the jungle on foot.
*   **C: guvan yaanaya kadaa waeteemata pera thun wathawak godabaemata uthsaha kaleya (The plane attempted to land three times before crashing):** This is **FALSE**. The text only mentions two attempts - one aborted due to weather, and the second that ended in a crash before landing.
*   **D: guvan yaanaya anathurata lak wu sthaanaya seweema ayahapath kaalagunaya nisa balapaemata lak viya (Searching the crash site was affected by bad weather):** This is **TRUE**. The text mentions the bad weather hindered the search efforts.

The question asks which statement is an **INACCURATE** detail about the crash, which means it wasn't reported in the provided text.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C**."
CG4684 yaanaya godabaema awalangu kirimata hethuwa kumakda?,"Based on the text provided (translated to English for clarity), the correct answer is **D: kalagunika thaththwaya ayahapath viya (The weather conditions were unfavorable)**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Twin otter aircraft flight number 4684 of the air service attempted to land in Kokoda but was aborted once. It disappeared about ten minutes before its scheduled second attempt to land... Adverse weather conditions, which caused the failed landing, are also hampering search efforts.""

This clearly indicates the first landing attempt was aborted due to **unfavorable weather conditions**.

"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, f‍raensissek kowalge athdaekeem pilibanda sathyaya wanne pahatha sandahan prakaashayangen kawareda?","Let's break down the passage and the options:

**The Passage (Translated):**

""In my dream, nothing happened to me, but I saw a very terrible event where people were trying to break the windows to get out. People hit the glass with chairs, but the windows couldn't be broken. ""Finally, one window pane broke, and they started to come out of that pane,"" said Franciszek Kovel, a survivor.""

**Analysis of the Options:**

*   **A: ohu janelayak binda daemeemata samath viya (He managed to break a window.)** - The passage states that *others* were hitting the windows with chairs. It doesn't say Franciszek broke any windows himself. So, this is unlikely.

*   **B: awasanaye ohu nirupad‍rithawa sitiyeya (In the end, he was unharmed.)** - The first sentence says ""nothing happened to me"". While it's a dream, the experience was frightening, so it's possible he was physically unharmed. This seems plausible.

*   **C: pitathata yaamata uthsaha karana atharathura ohu putuwak kadaa daemeeya (He broke a chair while trying to get out.)** - The passage says people used *chairs* to break windows, not that Franciszek broke a chair. Also, it's not about him trying to get out, but about observing.

*   **D: janelayak kaedeemata uthsaha karamin sitiyadee ohu thuwala laebeeya (He was injured while trying to break a window.)** - The first sentence states nothing happened to him. This directly contradicts this option.

**Conclusion:**

Option B is the most accurate reflection of Franciszek Kowal's experience as described in the passage.

**Therefore, the correct answer is B.**
"
daeniyel niwarthana kunaatuve balapaema thakseru kirima abhiyogathmaka wanne aeyi?,"The correct answer is **C: kunaatuva godabimata durin pawathee** (The hurricane is far from land).

The passage states: ""Suli sulanga bhoomi pradeshayen aethata vannata aethi nisa emagin eksath janapadayata ho kaeribiyanu pradeshayata aethi viya haeki balapaema aegayima asiru wee aetha.""

This translates to: ""Because the hurricane is likely to move away from land, it is difficult to assess the potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.""

Therefore, the difficulty in assessing the impact of Hurricane Danielle is directly linked to its distance from land. The other options aren't the primary reason for the difficulty mentioned in the passage.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, daeniyel niwarthana kunaatuva pilibandawa sathya nowanne pahatha sandahan prakaashawalin kawareda?","The correct answer is **D: eka godabimata aasannawa pawathee (It is currently close to land).**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Suli sulanga bhoomi pradeshayen aethata vannata aethi nisa emagin eksath janapadayata ho kaeribiyanu pradeshayata aethi viya haeki balapaema aegayima asiru wee aetha.""  This translates to ""Since the cyclone is expected to move *away* from land, it is difficult to assess the impact it may have on the United States or the Caribbean region.""  The key phrase is ""away from land,"" contradicting option D.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

* **A: eya kaeribiyan doopath kerehi aethi karana balapaema nodanee (Its impact on the Caribbean islands is not known):** The passage states the difficulty in assessing the impact on the Caribbean.
* **B: eya athlaanthik sagaraye nirmanaya viya (It originated in the Atlantic Ocean):** The passage explicitly mentions it formed in the ""athlaanthik samudraye"" (Atlantic Ocean).
* **C: eya suli kunaatuvak bawata path viya haekiya (It may become a hurricane):**  The passage states ""badaadaa wana vita daniyel, kunatuvak dakva dakva prabala vanu aetha"" which means ""Daniel is expected to strengthen to a hurricane.""

Therefore, option D is the *only* statement that is *not* supported by the information in the passage, making it the correct answer.

"mema chedayata anuwa, rajaye samastha ilakkaya wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **D: maediri senagin piree ithiree yama samanaya kirima (minimizing overcrowding in buildings)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage mentions:** ""Senaga waedi weema ivath kirimata..."" which translates to ""To avoid overcrowding...""
* **The rest of the passage explains *how* they are trying to achieve this:** By adding more buildings (specifically, increasing the total number of vehicles/buildings to 1,300 by adding 300 more).

While A, B, and C are things that *are* happening (funding, getting more buildings), they are the *means* to the *end* of reducing overcrowding. The *overall goal* or *objective* is to address the overcrowding issue.
"
rajaya niwedanaya kale kumakda?,"The most accurate answer is **A: amathara maediri 300 k sandaha aramudal saepayeemata owun saelasum karayi** (They plan to allocate funds for 300 additional units).

Here's why:

*   The passage directly states: ""P: Ada dina nivedanaya magin amathara maediri sandaha aramudal saepayima sandaha me vasare maarthu maasayedi rajaya dakwana kaepaweema da dirgha viya. Senaga waedi weema ivath kirimata amathara 300 k ek kara mulu waahana sankhyava 1,300 k karayi."" This translates to: ""The government's allocation for funds for additional units, through today's request, was extended to March this year. An additional 300 were added to eliminate overcrowding, bringing the total number of vehicles to 1,300.""

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: maediri gaetaluwa samanaya kirimata owun kaepawee sitee (They are committed to solving the unit problem):** While they are trying to alleviate overcrowding, the passage focuses on the allocation of funds for the *additional units*.
*   **C: amathara maediri 1,300 k sandaha aramudal saepayeemata owun saelasum karayi (They plan to allocate funds for 1,300 additional units):** The passage mentions that the *total* number of units will be 1,300 after adding 300 *additional* units. The government is allocating funds for the 300 *additional* units, not 1,300 new ones.
*   **D: senaga piree ithiree yame gaetaluwa maarthu wana vita visandanu aetha (The overcrowding problem will be solved by March):** The passage doesn't guarantee the problem *will* be solved, only that the funding allocation is extended to March. There's no guarantee the problem will be entirely solved by then.

Therefore, option A is the most directly supported by the text."
"mema chedayata anuwa, dannaa thorathuru wanne monawada?","The correct answer is **A: tharjana mattama adu wee aetha** (threat level has been reduced).

Here's why:

* The passage states ""tharjana mattama daedi lesa adu kireemen..."" which directly translates to ""by significantly reducing the threat level...""

The other options are incorrect based on the provided passage:

*   **B: thawaduratath tharjanayak nomaetha** (there is no further threat): The passage says reducing the threat level doesn't mean the threat has completely disappeared.
*   **C: prahaarayak apekshaa kere** (an attack is expected): The passage says that intelligence reports don't indicate to expect an immediate attack.
*   **D: prahaaraya darunu wanu aethi bawata buddhi ansha thahawuru kara aetha** (intelligence confirmed that the attack would be severe): The passage mentions intelligence reports not indicating an immediate attack, so this is not confirmed.
"
virodhathaavaya pilibanda sathya nowana prakaashaya kawareda?,"Let's break down the original statement and the answer choices:

* **Original Statement Summary:**  A social media campaign has caused delays to a new temporary election management board (CEP).  There's pressure to make the CEP permanent.  A presidential commission recently dismissed a former CEP due to a package of measures regarding election irregularities. This commission responded to widespread opposition against politicians in October.  Opposition led to a violent, divisive election with limited turnout, and the CEP was appointed in 2011.

Now let's evaluate the answer choices:

* **A: janaadhipati komisama virodhathaavalata prathichaarayak viya (The presidential commission responded to the opposition.)** - This is directly supported by the text: ""Ema komisama oktober maasaye dee paalakayinta viruddhava vyaaptava aethi woo virodhataavalata maartellige prathicharaya viya.""  The commission *did* respond to the widespread opposition. **This is likely the correct answer.**

* **B: kal giya maethivarana nisa virodhatha avuuwanu laebeeya (Because of the past election, opposition arose.)** - The text *implies* this, stating the election was divisive and violent (which likely contributed to opposition), but it doesn't explicitly say the *election* *caused* the opposition.

* **C: virodhatha magin pera see. ee. pee. sabhawa illaa asviya yuthu bawa illaa sitina ladee (Because of the opposition, the previous CEP board did not refuse to refuse to dismiss )** - This is incorrect and difficult to understand based on the given information. The text states the Presidential Comission dismissed the previous CEP, therefore, it's safe to say they did get dismissed because of the opposition.

* **D: virodhatha samahara vitaka prachandakaree viya (The opposition was violent and divisive.)** - This is directly supported by the text: ""Viteka-prachandakari wana virodhathaa avuluvanu laebuwe maetivaranayak paewathweemata apohosat weemen athara...""  The opposition *was* divisive and violent. **However, the question asks about a statement *regarding* the opposition.** The statement does not suggest the opposition caused the violence and divisiveness, so this is not a true reflection of what the text provides.

**Conclusion:**

The best answer is **A: janaadhipati komisama virodhathaavalata prathichaarayak viya (The presidential commission responded to the opposition.)** This is the most accurate and direct statement taken from the passage about opposition."
pera see. ee. pee. sabhawa illaa asviya yuthu yaeyi yojanaa kale kawuda?,"The correct answer is **C: janaadhipath komisama**.

The passage states that the US Olympic Committee supports USA Gymnastics to foster a safe environment for athletes and recognizes the Olympic family's paramount needs. It says that USA Gymnastics is supporting an independent review of the abuse by Larry Nassar and will accept necessary and appropriate changes. The ultimate goal is to make sports safer and more enabling, not to deny support.

The passage mentions:

*   **B: balagathu parisarayak nirmanaya kirima** (Creating a powerful environment). This is an *aim* of the collaboration.
*   **C: sanvidhaanaya thula awashya wenaskam** (Necessary changes in the organization). These are what the USOG is to adapt.
*   **D: swadheena vimarshanayak** (Independent review). USA gymnastics support, this is actually a component in recovering from the events with larry nassar.

The correct answer, sahathikaya naethi kirima, is more appropriate in this context as to whether USA Gymnastics will support the athletes while addressing the abuse issues or not."
"mema prakaashayata anuwa, aemarika eksath janapadaye jimnaastik saha eksath janapadaye olimpik kamituva yana deanshayema pradhaana ilakkaya wanuye kumakda?","The correct answer is **D: kreedaka kreedikawan sandaha aarakshitha parisarayak prawardhanaya kirima** (promoting a safe environment for athletes).

The passage clearly states:

* ""Aemarika eksath janapadaye olympik kamituve lipiyata aemarika eksath janapadaye gimnastik sahaya dakwana athara **apage siyaluma kridaka kridikaavanta aarakshitha parisarayak pravardhanaya kireema sandaha olympik pavule parama awashyathaavaya piligani.**"" (The US Olympic Committee supports US Gymnastics and recognizes the paramount importance of the Olympic family to **promote a safe environment for all our athletes**.)

While the other options are mentioned in the context of addressing the Larry Nassar situation and improving the system, the primary and overarching goal is athlete safety and well-being.
"
anathura siduwana vita yaathrawa gaman karamin sitiye koheda? ,"The correct answer is **C: palaawan**.

The passage states that the ""Aevengar khaandaye bim bomba prathiprahaara yaatravak, yaatrava palavaan hi poto prinsesa wetha yamin tibina."" This translates to ""Avenger class mine countermeasures ship was going to Puerto Princesa, Palawan.""

Therefore, the ship was traveling towards Palawan.

"
"mema prakaashayata anuwa, allaa gath satankaruwan aarakshaa kirime wagakeema bharagena aeththe kumana ratada?","The correct answer is **D: thurkiya**.

The passage states: ""Kadaavaetima sidu vuyae kandukara seemaawaehi wana athara, **prathivaadi prahaaravala prathipalayak laesa sidu woo bavata vishvasa kaerae.**""

This translates to: ""The accident occurred in a mountainous area, and it is **believed to have occurred as a result of enemy fire/attack.**""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: sathuru wedi thaebeema (Enemy fire/attack)**
"
anathura sidu wuye kumana aakaraye bhoomi pradeshayaka da?,"Based on the provided text (translated into English), the accident occurred in a difficult (katuka) and mountainous (kandukara) terrain.

"
ganwathure prathiphalayak lesa niladhaareen apekshaa karanne kumakda?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: waeli baemma yathaawath kirima** (waeli para yathaevath kirimata).

The passage states: ""ganga pahala khaedanayata lak woo vaelipara yathaevath kirimata eya pramaenavat wei kiyae niladhearin apekshaa karathi."" This translates to: ""Officials expect that it [the increased water level] is sufficient to restore the eroded embankments along the river.""

wella idikirimata sthirawama balapaewe pahatha sandahan karunu atharin kawareda?,"The passage discusses the impact of the 1963 flood on the environment. Here's a breakdown to identify the factor that most strongly influenced the dam construction:

*   **The passage mentions the flood damaged the ""waelipara"".**
*   **After the flood, some officials hoped that after some time river levels might increase to restore the flood-damaged ""waelipara"".**
*   **The ""waelipara"" needs to be preserved, therefore it can be determined that it played a role in the dam's construction.**

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: waelipara**
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, eksath janapadayata siduviya haeki prahaara gaena thorathuru laba dunne kawuda?","The correct answer is **C: anaawaranaya nokala moolaash‍rayak**

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""Ithiyopiyaavae saha kenyaaave """"pramukasthaana"""" pupuravaa haerimata maraaagena maerena bomkaruvan yodaa gannaa bavata anaavaranaya nokarana mulaashrayakin thorathuru laeb aethi bhava eksath janapadaya pawasai.""
* **Translation:** The United States says it obtained information about potential bomb attacks targeting ""prominent places"" in Ethiopia and Kenya, from an undisclosed source.

Therefore, the ""anaavaranaya nokala moolaashrayak"" (undisclosed source) is the entity that provided the information to the United States.
"

Here's why:

*   P states that attacks are planned to be carried out in Somalia, Kenya, and Ethiopia, targeting, among other places, the US Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya. The statement implies that Ethiopia and Kenya will be key locations for bombing campaigns.

Therefore, the attack is going to be happening in more than one country which makes option B the right answer."
neethingayeku nowanne pahatha sandahan ayagen kawarek da?,"Based on the provided passage, the answer is **D: makis t‍rayantafilopolas**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions Petros Mantovalos's office being investigated for corruption.
*   It states that Sakis Kechagioglou and Giorgos Nikolaakopoulos are famous lawyers who were imprisoned.
*   It mentions that Makis Triantafyllopoulos is a journalist who revealed information on Alpha TV.
*   It also states that senior judge Evangelos Kalousis was also arrested for corruption and low-level behavior.

Therefore, Makis Triantafyllopoulos is the only one on the list who is specifically identified as a journalist, not a lawyer or judge.
"
greeka neethi prajaawa thula sidu wu apakeerthiyehi kotasak lesa sandahan nowanne kumana kandaayamada?,"The passage describes the disgrace within the Greek legal community due to the exposure of unethical and corrupt activities. It specifically mentions judges, lawyers (nithignayin), solicitors, and notaries being involved. Journalists are mentioned as reporting on the corruption, not as being part of the corrupt group.

Therefore, the group that is NOT mentioned as being part of the disgrace is **C: maadhyawedeen (journalists)**.
"

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: 7**.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, inime waedima lakunu pramaanaya wuye kumakda?","The question asks, ""According to the passage, what was the score made on the innings?"".

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A: lakunu 70
"
aedam kiyurdange kalakirimata hethuwak nowanne pahatha sandahan karunuwalin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: lingika anthargathaya pilibanda web adaviye nawa prathipaththiya** (a new policy on sexual content on the web platform).

Here's why:

* **P** states that the new policy was a *result* of public anger and media coverage surrounding Adam Cowardine's actions. Therefore, it wasn't a cause for his actions.
* **B, C, and D** are all mentioned in **P** as actions or statements made by Adam Cowardine that contributed to the situation: his deletion of artwork (B), his feigned willingness to listen (C), and his lies about the reasons for deleting artwork (D).

Therefore, the new policy on sexual content was a consequence of the situation, not a cause of Adam Cowardine's actions.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, web adaviyen maka damanu laebuwe kumakda?","The passage states that the ""prajaavae kopaya"" (public anger) led to an attempt to formulate a policy related to ""adaviyae lingika anthargathaya"" (sexual content on the website). This implies that sexual content was the issue.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: lingika anthargathaya** (sexual content).
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, ameer khaan sahaya nodakwanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The passage says:

*   Ameer Khan doesn't support including female wrestlers in the Olympics (""Kaantha nilayan aethulath kirimata siyallanma sahaya nodaekvi ya"").
*   He believes women shouldn't fight (""mage yati sithin sithanne kantavan satan nokala yuthu bavayi"").
*   He supports British competitors in the 2012 London Olympics (""2012 london hi pawathwena olympic ulalae brithaanya tharagakaruvanta sahaya dakwana bhava ohu prakaasha kalaeya"").

Therefore, Ameer Khan does not support **A: olimpik sandaha kantha satankaruwan aethulath kirima (including female wrestlers in the Olympics)**.

The answer is **A**."
"mema chedayata anuwa, ameer khaanta pawudgalika mathayak thibuna da, ohu sahaya dakwanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: 2012 olimpik ulela**.

The text states that despite Ameer Khan's personal opinion about women not participating in combat sports, he declared his support for British competitors in the 2012 London Olympics. This clearly indicates his support is directed towards the 2012 Olympic Games.
"
peetar lens miya giye kawadada?,"The correct answer is **C: rohale dee (at the hospital)**.

The passage states he was treated at the track and taken to a local hospital, where he later died.
"
seviyar sayat yanu kawuda?,"The correct answer is **B: wenath tharagakaruweku**

The passage states that Xavier was a ""sahodara tharagakaru,"" which translates to ""fellow competitor"" or ""brother racer"". This means he was another racer in the event.
"
guvan yaanayaka abhyanthara kriyakarithwaya therum gaeneemen kanassallata pathwa sitina guvan niyamuwekuta prayojana gatha haekke kumana thathwayakadee da?,"The correct answer is **B: piyasara kirimata aethi akamaeththa kend‍ragatha wee aeththe nodannaa de ha sambandha bheethiyak wata nam**.

Here's why:

* **Premise:** The passage explains that understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help alleviate fear rooted in the unknown and loss of control.

* **Question:** When would understanding the inner workings of an airplane be helpful to a passenger experiencing anxiety?

* **Option B aligns perfectly:** If the passenger's aversion to flying is centered around a fear of the unknown, then knowledge of the aircraft's inner workings directly addresses the root of their anxiety. The passage indicates that understanding the unknown is key to alleviating fear.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: magiya owunge biya gaena laejja wanne nam:** This option focuses on shame surrounding the fear, rather than the root of the fear. While addressing shame can be helpful, understanding the plane's workings is directly relevant to a fear of the unknown.

*   **C: magiya siyaluma prawaahanaya wargawalata akamaethi nam:** This is too broad. The passage specifically talks about anxieties related to flying, not all forms of travel.

*   **D: owunge kanassalla paena naginne piyasara kirima ha sambandha nowana wenath kampana sahagatha siduweemakin nam:** If the anxiety stems from something unrelated to flying itself (like a specific sound or vibration), understanding the plane's operation is unlikely to help.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, mila kerehi awadhaanaya yomu karana sanchaarakayeku awadhaaranaya kala yuththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","Based on the passage (P), the most relevant actions for a price-conscious traveler are:

*   **C: bahu sanchaaraka sewaawan athara mila sansandanaya karanna (Compare prices among multiple travel services)** - The passage explicitly states that different organizations can have significantly different prices for the same flight. This emphasizes the importance of price comparison.
*   **D: guvan sewaawe web adaviya pareekshaa karanna (Check the airline's website)** - The passage advises checking the airline's website before booking, even after paying for a service that compares options.

While option A (Search for promotions offered by multiple travel services) is indirectly related (promotions impact price), the passage focuses more directly on comparing prices *between* services and checking the airline directly. Option B (Book directly with the airline) is implied as a result of the advice in D.

Therefore, the most accurate answers are **C and D**.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, haeki hondama prawesha pathra milak laba gaeneema sandaha sanchaarakayeku palamuwa kala yuththe kumakda?","The passage (P) states:

*   It's difficult to book flights directly via airlines without comparing prices from different agencies/platforms.
*   Different agencies might have significantly different prices for the same flight.
*   **Before booking tickets, you should also check the airline's website**, even after comparing service rewards.

Therefore, the best answer based on the passage is:

**A: guvan sewaawe web adaviya pareekshaa karanna** (Check the airline's website)

While comparing prices across different platforms is mentioned, the passage emphasizes *also* checking the airline's website *before* finalizing the booking. The passage encourages you to check the airline web page before finalizing. So the best choice is A."
bhaanda gena yamak samaga ekata yamata keneku awashya wanne kawada da?,"The correct answer is **C: pareekshaa karana lada gaman malu lesa dewal yawana vita (when sending items as checked baggage)**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Eya vadaa wegayen sidu karagata haeki ekama margaya vuye eya parikshaaven bhaaragat gaman malu lesa yaevima ya."" which translates to ""The only way to do it faster is to send it as checked baggage.""

Therefore, you need someone to accompany the shipment if you are sending it as checked baggage. The other options don't necessarily require an accompanying person.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, sandhaanayaka nithara piyasara karana guvan sewayak thoraa gaeneemedee oba pramukhathawaya laba diya yuththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The passage (P) states:

*   You should enter an airline through an alliance with frequent flier programs.
*   You might hide your need to frequently fly with an airline, and the benefits offered always change, and you should know that frequent flier miles in another airline under the same alliance may be more rewarding.

The question (Q) asks: According to this passage, what should you prioritize when choosing a frequent flyer airline in an alliance?

Considering the passage, the best answer is:

**A: waedima lakunu laba dena guvan sewaya (Airline that gives more miles)**

Here's why: The passage highlights the fact that within an alliance, one airline's frequent flier program may be *more rewarding* than another. This means that earning more miles per flight is a crucial factor to consider.

The other options are not directly supported by the passage:

*   **B: vishaalathama sandhaanaye guvan sewaya (Airline in the largest alliance):** The passage doesn't prioritize the *size* of the alliance, but rather the *rewards* within the alliance.
*   **C: oba boho vita gaman karana guvan sewaya (Airline you travel with most often):** The passage mentions that you might try to ""hide your need to frequently fly with an airline"". This implies it's not a priority to just choose the one you use the most.
*   **D: amathara waraprasada ek kala haeki guvan sewaya (Airline that can add extra perks):** The passage mentions that the benefits offered always change, so you should check for the best option, which is more likely to be the option with the most rewarding miles.

So, the most accurate answer based on the provided passage is **A**."
"mema chedayata anuwa, niranthara piyasara lakunu laba diya haekke katada?","The correct answer is **D: ekama sandhaanaya thula wenath guvan sewayak**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""...ekama sandhaanaya yatathe wana wenath guvan sevayaka nirantara piyaasara lakunu waedi washayen thyaagasili viya haeki bawath oba daenagata yutuya.""
*   This directly translates to: ""...you should know that another airline within the same alliance can more readily reward frequent flyer points.""

Therefore, the only option that aligns with the passage is **D**."
"mema chedayata anuwa, adhika lesa mathpaen paanaya kirimen pahatha sandahan ind‍riya walin durwala viya haekke kumana ind‍riya da?","Based on the passage provided, the answer is **B: peneema (seeing)**.

The passage states that excessive alcohol consumption can lead to ""andha bhaavaya,"" which translates to blindness. Therefore, it directly affects the ability to see. The relevant sentence is: ""Adhika mathpaen bhaavithayen dirgha kaaleena rogee tattva wana akmaavata haani weema menma **andha bhaavaya** saha maranaya pavaa sidu viya haeka.""
"
"mema chedaye sandahan wana paridi, mathpaen wala hanikara balapaem awama kala haekke kumak magin da?","The correct answer is **C: madhyasthawa mathpaen paanaya kirima** (moderate alcohol consumption).

Here's why:

* The passage emphasizes the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption and illegally produced alcohol.
* Option C, moderate alcohol consumption, aligns with the implied advice to avoid the extremes that lead to negative health consequences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: methanol sahitha mathpaen paanaya kirima** (drinking alcohol containing methanol) - The passage explicitly states that methanol is a dangerous contaminant in illegally produced alcohol and can cause blindness or death.
* **B: neethi virodhee lesa nipadawana mathpaen paanaya kirima** (drinking illegally produced alcohol) - The passage highlights the dangers of illegal alcohol due to contaminants like methanol.
* **D: vividha pudgalayan samaga mathpaen paanaya kirima** (drinking alcohol with various individuals) - This is irrelevant to the health risks discussed in the passage.

Therefore, the answer is C.
"
aemstardaem hi ihalama depala watinaakamak aeththe koheda?,"The correct answer is **A: aela disthrikkaya**.

The passage states: ""Aela distrikkaya (landesi basin: graechengordel) yanu amsterdaem hi binanstaed vatakara aethi...ehi depala vatinaakama rate ihalama agayan athara wei."" This translates to ""The Aela district (Dutch basin: Graechengordel) is located around Binnenstad in Amsterdam...its property value is among the highest in the country.""

Therefore, Aela district has the highest property values in Amsterdam.
"
aela disthrikkaya yuneskowa visin loka uruma bhoomiyak lesa nam kara aeththe aeyi?,"Based on the provided paragraph (P), the correct answer is:

**A: ehi ayithihaasika ha sanskruthika watinaakama (its historical and cultural value)**

The paragraph explicitly states that the entire district has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its unique cultural and historical value.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, nom krom wetha yamata watinaakam denne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","Based on the provided text (P), the reason for the worthiness of visiting Nom Krom is:

*   **A: tonle saepge darshanaya (The view of Tonle Sap)**

The text specifically mentions ""Devamaaligave anduru waathaawaranaya saha tonley saep vilata ihalin penena darshanaya, kanda naegimata vatinaakamak labaa dei."" which translates to ""The temple's somber atmosphere and the view of Tonle Sap from above make climbing the mountain worthwhile.""

While the other options are related to visiting the area, they are not explicitly stated as the reason that makes visiting Nom Krom worthwhile according to the text.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, nom krom wetha aethulu weemata amuththanta awashya wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: aengkor pas laba gaeneema**.

The passage states: ""Pansalata aetuluvimata aengkor pravesha pathraya awashya baevin..."" which translates to ""An Angkor entrance pass is required to enter the temple...""
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, aentaktikawa naerabimen sanchaarakayin walakwanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **D: seemitha bhawthika sanchalathawa** (Limited physical mobility).

Here's why:

The passage mentions ""sharirika suvataavada awashya we"" (physical fitness is required) to travel to Antarctica. This implies that limitations in physical fitness could prevent some tourists from going. While the passage also mentions high travel costs (A), seasonal limitations (C), and doesn't really imply B as a reason not to visit, the need for physical fitness is a direct barrier as indicated by the passage.
"
kandu naegeemata unanduwak dakwana sanchaarakayeku aentaktikawe kumana pradeshayata sanchaaraya kala haekida?,"The correct answer is **B: abhyanthara pradesha**.

The passage states: ""Indahita visheshagna guvan chaarika abyantarayata, kandu naegimata ho vishaala kandavurak aethi draevayata lagaa we."" This translates to ""Occasionally, expert air travel goes to the interior, for mountaineering or to a drive with a large camp.""  This directly implies that a tourist interested in mountaineering can travel to the interior of Antarctica.
"
poorwa noothana nireekshanagarayak godanaganu laebeemata adu haekiyawak aeththe koheda?,"Based on the provided text, the best answer is **C: durastha sthaanayaka**

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions ""Boho nuthana paryeshana dureksa hithakara vaayugoliya thatva sahitha durastha pradeshawala aethi vishaala parishra we"" which translates to ""Many new researches are broad campus in remote areas along with the pleasant atmosphere.""
*   It also states ""durakshana hithakara vayugoliya thatva sahitha durasta pradesha."" meaning ""remote location with a pleasant atmosphere for remote work.""

This strongly suggests that new observational centers, especially those for research, are often located in remote areas (durastha sthaanayaka)."
naweena paryeshana durekshayak sthaanagatha kala haekke kothaenada?,"Based on the passage P, it is mentioned that a new observatory can be commonly a place of curiosity, a teaching place, or a place with vast infrastructure.

Comparing this to the options in Q and A:

*   **A: kauthukagarayaka (place of curiosity)** - Directly mentioned in passage P.
*   **B: vishwa vid‍yaala mandapayaka (university building)** - Not directly mentioned.
*   **C: adhyaapana sthaanayaka (teaching place)** - Directly mentioned in passage P.
*   **D: vishaala parish‍rayaka (vast infrastructure)** - Directly mentioned in passage P.

Since the prompt asks where a new research observatory can be located, and all of A, C and D are options that are stated in the prompt, we must look at the question being asked:

""Where can a new research observatory be located?""

Looking at passage P, the answer is that a new research observatory can commonly be *all* of the options, however, the question is a little bit ambiguous and could be interpreted as what *type* of place is a new research observatory. With this in mind, the option that describes this the most out of the possible answers is **D: vishaala parishrayaka (vast infrastructure)**, since modern observatories must have extensive infrastructure to function.

Therefore, the best answer is:

**D: vishaala parish‍rayaka**
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, nihanda werala dinayak sandaha wadaath sudusu wanne kumana pradeshayada?","Based on the provided text, here's the breakdown and the correct answer:

*   **The text describes North Harbour (Uthuru Varaaya Distrikkaya) as having sheltered beaches with white sand, safe swimming, and shade from pohutukawa trees.** This makes it ideal for a quiet beach day.

*   **Mission Bay and St Heliers are described as being near retail suburbs and sometimes crowded, especially as family beaches.** This suggests they might be busier.

*   **Wayitemata Harbour is described as having a good selection of boats and sometimes gets crowded, especially as family beaches.** This suggests they might be busier.

Therefore, the best answer is:

**C: uthuru waraaya disthrikkaya**"
"mema chedayata anuwa, pihinum thathwayan wadaath aarakshitha viya haekke kothaenada?","The passage mentions that swimming is safe at ""Tamaaki Drive beaches"", which are located in ""central Auckland"" (madhyama okland).  Therefore, the best answer is:

"
mema chedaye visthara kara aethi sthaanayata piviseeme dee nusudusu yaeyi saelakenne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The passage clearly states that the following are inappropriate:

*   ""samula ghaatanaya ho naaseen pilibanda vihilu nokaranna"" (Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis). Therefore, **C: vihilu kirima (joking)** is inappropriate.
*   ""Vyuha mata kurutu gaemen ho seereemen mema sthaanaya vikurti nokaranna."" (Do not deface this place by scribbling or drawing on structures). Therefore, **D: vyuhayak matha kurutu gaema (scribbling on a structure)** is inappropriate.

The passage instructs that one should treat the area with reverence and respect, so **A: sansunwa haesireema (behaving calmly)** would be appropriate, not inappropriate.

The passage doesn't explicitly mention anything about signs, therefore **B: adaviya wata kothaenaka ho salakunak thaebeema (placing a sign somewhere around the site)** cannot be considered inappropriate based on the text provided. It might depend on the content and nature of the sign, but that's not specified.

Therefore, the best answers are C and D. Since you can only select one, it's best to choose the more explicit examples from the text.

**The best single answer is C: vihilu kirima.**

However, **D: vyuhayak matha kurutu gaema** is also clearly inappropriate.

If this were a multiple-choice question where you could choose multiple answers, you should choose C and D.

podu bhaashawan visthara karanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"According to passage P, a ""podu bhashawa"" (common language) is described as **""svabhaavika ho mulika bhaasha""** (natural or fundamental language).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **D: moolika (fundamental)**

The other options (A: kruthima - artificial, B: aswabhavika - unnatural, C: godanaga gath - built/constructed) describe ""Upakaaraka bhaasha"" (auxiliary languages) as mentioned in the passage."
upakaraka bhaashawan niwaeradiwa visthara nokarana prakaashaya kumakda?,"Let's analyze the statement P and the options provided to find the correct answer.

Statement P defines a supportive language (Upakaaraka bhaasha) as a constructed or artificial language created to facilitate communication between people who might otherwise have difficulty communicating.  It distinguishes this type of language from natural or primary languages used for communication between speakers of different languages for a specific reason or other purpose, which it terms ""common language.""

Now let's look at the options:

*   **A: ewa wenath aakarayakin ekineka therum nogannaa pudgalayin athara sanniwedanaya pahasu kirima sandaha bhaavitha karana moolika bhaashawan we** - *These are primary languages used to facilitate communication between individuals who would not otherwise understand each other.* This is incorrect. Statement P emphasizes that supportive languages are *not* natural or primary languages.

*   **B: ewa swabhavika ha godanagagath bhaasha we** - *These are natural and constructed languages.* This is incorrect. Statement P states that supportive languages are constructed.

*   **C: ewa apahasu sanniwedana awasthaa waedi diyunu kirima sandaha godanagana lada bhaashawan we** - *These are languages constructed to further improve difficult communication situations.* This aligns with Statement P's definition of supportive languages being created to *facilitate* communication where it is otherwise difficult.

*   **D: ewa vividha bhaasha katha karannan athara prachalitha godanagana lada bhaashawan we** - *These are popular constructed languages between diverse language speakers.* While supportive languages might be used between diverse language speakers, this option focuses on popularity and is not the core definition in statement P.

Therefore, the best answer is **C** as it correctly reflects the core idea from statement P: supportive languages are constructed to improve difficult communication situations."
"mema chedayata anuwa, magiyeku owunge yathrawe gamana sheetha irthuwe nam pareekshaa kala yuththe kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: kutiye pihiteema**.

The passage explicitly states that ""Sheeta kaalaye dee uthuru boltik pradeshaya tharanaya karanne nam, kutiye pihitima pariksha karanna"" (If you are crossing the Northern Baltic region in winter, check the location of the cabin).  The reason given is the potential for ice-related sounds and impacts.
"
"mema lipiyata anuwa, magiyekuge yathrawe gamana gimhanaye nam, owun walakwa gatha yuthu de kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: ayis haraha gaman kirima**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""manda ayis harahaa gaman kirimedi, vadaat balapaemak lakwannanta, ithaa darunu shabdayak aesena baevini"" which translates to ""because when traveling through ice, to experience a greater impact, a very loud sound is heard.""  Therefore, the passage advises checking the ship's position if traveling through the North Baltic region in winter (Sheeta kaalaye) because of the danger of ice travel.
* The question asks what a passenger should be prevented from if their journey is in the summer.  The passage only warns about problems related to ice, so ice travel would be the only thing relevant to prevent.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: nagaraye welaawa (city time):** This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **C: visaa awashyatha (visa requirements):** While visa requirements are mentioned, it's in the context of needing *no* visa for passengers in St. Petersburg, making it irrelevant to what needs to be prevented.
* **D: sent peetarasbarg (St. Petersburg):** The passage doesn't suggest avoiding St. Petersburg. It only mentions it as a location where the passenger spent time on a ship.
"
kaetalan boho vita basilonaa sanngaa saha niwedana sandaha bhaavitha karanne aeyi?,"Based on the information provided in passage P, the most accurate answer is **B: eya nagaraye palamu nila bhaashawa viya (it is the first official language of the city).**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Catalan, along with Spanish, are the official languages of Barcelona (""Basilona hi raajya bhaasha kaetalan saha spangna bhaasha we""). This directly supports the idea that Catalan has official status in the city.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: eya spaangnga bhaashawata wadaa pulul lesa therum gatha haekiya (it is more widely understood than Spanish)**: While the passage mentions that a significant percentage of the population speaks Catalan, it also says that Spanish is more widely used (""spaangna bhaashaava da podu pravaahanaye saha wenath pahasukamwala pululwa bhavitha kere""). So, this statement is inaccurate.
*   **C: basilonaa we wadaath kaemathi bhaashawa meyayi (it is the most preferred language in Barcelona)**: The passage doesn't explicitly state that Catalan is the *most preferred* language. It highlights its official status and usage, but doesn't quantify preference.
*   **D: mett‍ro maarga saha anekuth podu pahasukam boho vita kaetalan bhaashawa katha karana purawaesiyan nithara paeminena sthaana we (metro routes and other public facilities are often places frequented by residents who speak Catalan)**: While this could be true, the passage doesn't provide specific information about the language used in metro routes and other public facilities. The focus is on the official language status and the usage in news reports."

This translates to: ""The city's daily reports are published in Catalan, but unscheduled announcements are made automatically through a system in several languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.""

The question is: ""Which of the following languages are used to publish daily reports in the Barcelona metro system?""

Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Katalaan (Catalan)** because it is stated that the daily reports are published in Catalan. The other languages are used for *unscheduled announcements*, not the daily reports.

*   **Supiri aendan (Super beds):** Specifically mentioned as contributing to the artistic element and overall comfort.
*   **Udaesana aahara (Breakfast):** Also a significant factor, with unique, seasonal, or personalized offerings.
*   **Athin saadhana lada poronayak ho pauranika aendak (Handcrafted linen or antique bed):** A detail emphasizing the luxury and uniqueness of the sleeping experience.
*   **Irtuwata avenika rasavat aahara ho satkaarakayaa visin sapayanu labana visheshitha aahara (Seasonal delicacies or special meals offered by the host):** A clear example of personalized breakfast experiences.
*   **Pauranika lee badu, sumata polava saha pihinum thataakayak sahitha aitihaasika paerani godanaegilla (Historical building with antique furniture, smooth floors, and a swimming pool):** The overall ambiance and historical character of the location.
*   **Desheeyawa labagath aahara saha beema (Locally sourced food and drinks)**: It can be inferred that offering locally sourced food and drinks for breakfast is a competitive factor.

Considering the passage's focus, let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Samakaleena alankaranaya (Contemporary decoration):** While a well-maintained and stylish decor might be important, the passage emphasizes historical elements, handcrafted items, and unique experiences over purely contemporary design.

*   **B: Irtumaya aahara paraasayak pirinaemeema (Offering a seasonal food range):** Directly mentioned as a key point of differentiation.

*   **C: Supiri aendan (Super beds):** Directly mentioned as a key competitive factor.

*   **D: Desheeyawa labagath aahara saha beema (Locally sourced food and drinks):** Although not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that offering locally sourced food and drinks for breakfast is a competitive factor, as it aligns with the theme of unique and personalized experiences.

Based on the above analysis, **A: Samakaleena alankaranaya (Contemporary decoration)** is the option *least* emphasized as a primary competitive advantage in the passage. The text focuses more on antique/historical elements and individualized service.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that skiing events (Skeeyin isav) are held in the Thaisicheng Ski Region, which is located 220 km away from Beijing.** Therefore, events held in Thaisicheng do not happen in Beijing.

* **The passage also mentions that Beijing is hosting the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as the indoor ice events (gruhastha hima isav).** Therefore, the other options occur in Beijing.

kurulu influvensa waelandeeme waedima avadaanamak aeththe katada?,"The correct answer is **C: kukulu ghanaye govipalawala waeda karana aya**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Boho eva kukulu ganaye govipalavala waeda karana aya ha sambandha wee aetha..."" which translates to: ""Most of them are related to those working in chicken farms...""

While the passage mentions bird watchers and mammals, the strongest association of the influenza outbreak is with those working in chicken farms.

Let's break down why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...namuth paksheen narambannanta yam avadaanama da aetha.""  This translates to ""but bird watchers also have some risk."" This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kukulu ghanaye govipalawala waeda karana ayata pamanak una waelandee aetha (Only those working on chicken farms have contracted the flu)** The passage states that many cases are related to those working on chicken farms, *but not exclusively*. It implies there are other avenues of transmission.
* **B: kurullanta wadaa minisun thula rogeen waedi pramaanayak wartha wee aetha (More cases have been reported in humans than in birds)** The passage says that fewer than 1000 human cases have been reported. It doesn't provide statistics on the number of bird cases, so we can't say if this is true.
* **D: minisun thula waartha wu siyaluma siduweem maraanthika wee aetha (All reported cases in humans have been fatal)** The passage states that *these cases* have been fatal, not necessarily all cases ever reported.

Therefore, option C is the only statement that is explicitly supported by the given passage."

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states that due to Singapore's location slightly north of the equator (""ihala nivartana kalaapaye""), you will have to deal with high temperatures (""ihala ushnathwaya"").

The other options are not directly supported by the text:

*   A: kollakaemata lak weema (Getting robbed): The text mentions Singapore is very safe.
*   B: sappu walata praweshayak nomaethi weema (Not having access to shops): The text says it's easy to buy anything after arriving.
*   D: atharaman weema (Getting lost): The text doesn't mention anything about getting lost."

Here's why:

* The passage mentions that many German baked goods contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Therefore, someone with a nut allergy would need to be careful when indulging in German pastries.
* The other options are not directly related to warnings that someone should not indulge in a german pastry.
"
germanu pestri wala irthumaya angayak lesa salakanu labanne kumana amud‍ravyayada?,"The correct answer is **C: plam**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""sarath irtuvedi cheri saha **plam** ek vemin rasavat we."" This translates to ""cherries and **plums** become delicious in the autumn season."" The question is asking what ingredient is considered an *seasonal* aspect in German pastries, and plums are specifically mentioned in relation to autumn.

The other options, while present in German pastries, are not specifically described as being linked to a particular season in the passage.

"mema chedayata anuwa, adu ayawaeyak samaga gaman sandaha nirdeshayak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The passage explicitly warns against certain behaviors while traveling on a budget. Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: sanchaaraya atharathura amuthu raekiya seweema (Seeking unusual jobs while traveling):** This is a common strategy for budget travel and aligns with the idea of earning money while traveling, which the passage mentions as a viable approach.

*   **B: obe suwapahasu mattama samaga nam‍yasheelee weema (Being flexible with your comfort level):** The passage mentions that those who are willing to sacrifice comfort should look at budget travel. Flexibility in comfort is implied as necessary for budget travel.

*   **C: minisungen mudal illaa siteema (Asking people for money):** The passage explicitly states that travelers should not beg, exploit others, or engage in illegal activities. Asking people for money falls under this category of unethical or exploitative behavior.

*   **D: aahara saha nawaathaen waeni viyadam kapaa haereema (Cutting expenses like food and lodging):** This directly relates to the advice given in the passage about limiting expenses.

Therefore, the answer is **C: minisungen mudal illaa siteema (Asking people for money)**. It is the only option that is explicitly advised *against* in the passage."
"mema chedayata anuwa, itha awama ayawaeyak samaga gaman kirimata apahasu kalayak thibiya haekke katada?","Based on the passage, the answer is **B: daedi kala seemawan nomaethi keneku** (someone without strict time constraints).

*   The passage mentions that ""Suvapahasuva, kaalaya kaepa kirimata kaemati aya saha viyadam binduvakata aasannava adu kara gaenimata kaemati aya, avama pirivaeya sanchaarayan balanna."" This translates to: ""Those who like comfort, are willing to sacrifice time, and want to reduce expenses to almost zero, should look at minimal budget travel.""
*   Since minimal budget travel involves sacrificing comfort and spending less money, it often requires more time. Therefore, someone with no strict time constraints would be better suited to such a challenge.
*   The other options don't directly relate to the text's focus on time and budget flexibility for minimal budget travel."
maeriyan poyint saha feyarmont athara gamana niwaeradiwa visthara nokaranne pahatha sandahan prakaashawalin kawareda?,"Let's analyze the provided information (translated to understand the context):

The first paragraph describes a challenging road along the Baffalo-Pittsburgh highway, between Marion Township and Fayette Township. It mentions:

*   Continuous sharp bends.
*   Potentially challenging driving if you're not used to rural roads.
*   Sharp curves, tight turns, and steep slopes.
*   Posted speed limits in the initial and later sections are seemingly low, and it's important to adhere to them.
*   Cell phone service is generally strong, unlike other areas.

Based on this, let's look at the answer options:

*   **A: dura baehaera pradeshawala digu maarga thibe** (There are long roads in remote areas) - This is a possible truth as it is described as a challenging rural road, however, it's not one of the main points emphasized.

*   **B: mantheeru patu we** (The turns are tight) - This is directly stated: ""patu mantheeru"" (tight turns).

*   **C: wega seemawan itha kalaathurakin anugamanaya karanu laebe** (Speed limits are rarely followed) - The text emphasizes that it is *important* to follow the low speed limits.

*   **D: jangama durakathana sewaawa gaetaluwak noviya yuthuya** (Cell phone service shouldn't be a problem) - The text says cell service is strong, unlike other areas. Thus, this statement is true.

Therefore, the best answers are **B and D** as both accurately reflect statements directly made in the passage.

* **Hudekala wanaanthara bim theeru nirantarayen pasu kerena...daedi abhiyogaatmaka riya paedaweeme tattva thibe:** The highway passes through remote, forested areas, leading to challenging driving conditions.
* **Grameeya maargavala riya paedaweema obata huru naethinam, obage daksataava thabaa ganna: thivra baevum, patu mantheeru, saha daedi vanggu sahitha maarga:** If you're not used to rural roads, be prepared for sharp turns, steep slopes, and deep curves.
* **Pera haa pasu kotasvala prakaashitha vega seema kaepi penena lesa aduya - saamanyayen pae./ki.mee. 35 - 40 (pae/ki.mee. 56 - 64):** Speed limits are noticeably lower than expected.

Considering these factors, the **most accurate** answer from the provided options is:

*   **C: thiyunu wanguwak itha wegayen gaeneema (Navigating sharp curves at high speed)**. The text explicitly mentions sharp turns (""thivra baevum"" and ""daedi vanggu"") and the potential for challenging driving conditions.

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: adhika waahana thadabadayaka sira wee siteema (Getting stuck in heavy traffic)** The text does not mention of traffic congestion.

*   **B: pramaanawath jangama durakathana sewaawak nomaethi weema (Lacking standard mobile phone service)** While the text mentions good mobile phone service compared to other routes in the area, this is a positive aspect, not a primary concern for drivers.

*   **D: nithara maarga idikirimawalata muhuna deema (Facing frequent road construction)** The text does not mention road construction.

**Therefore, C is the most accurate answer, highlighting the need to drive cautiously due to the sharp turns and steep slopes on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway.**"

Here's why:

* **P: Kurubiliya... aarambha kireema sandaha sapeksava etharam puhunuvak how saririka haedayak awashya nove...** (Kurubiliya... relatively not much training or physical strength is required to start...)

This sentence directly states that kurubiliya doesn't require a lot of training or physical fitness to begin. Therefore, both B and D align with the statement. However, the most accurate is B as the text does directly reference ""saririka haedayak"" (physical strength) which is more closely associated with ""maximum physical fitness."" While some training is still necessary, the statement emphasizes that there is not *a lot* required, so D is also correct, but less correct.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: pihineeme haekiyawa (swimming ability)** and **C: paeneeme haekiyawa (climbing ability)**:  The text says that swimming and climbing are *integrated* into canyoning, implying they are needed. So, you *do* need those skills.
"

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes that motorcycling for long trips allows you to become more familiar with your vehicle and understand its limitations. This is crucial for any trip, but especially important for ""motorcycle camping"" as the passage states it is an uncommon method.
*   Option B discusses what *other* kinds of vehicle could be used for camping, not what would be beneficial for someone already planning to camp on a motorbike.
*   Options C & D may be beneficial for any camping plan but are not directly highlighted as something that is important or useful when using a motorbike to camp.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, motar ratha kandawuru bandinnan anawashya awadhaanayen waelakee siteemata balaaporoththu wanne nam, owunta awashya viya haekke kumak da?","The correct answer is **A: esyuwee rathayak ho minivaen rathayak waeni vishaala waahanayak dhaawanaya kirima**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that motorbikes can easily attract unnecessary attention when camping on private land or in a small city.
*   It then suggests that if you have a larger vehicle like a minivan or SUV, ""motor rathha kandavuru baedhima kala haekiya,"" meaning you can camp without attracting as much attention.

Therefore, the passage implies that if you want to avoid unwanted attention while camping, driving a larger vehicle like an SUV or minivan is a better option than using a motorbike.

* **Translation:** ""Sintra became popular among foreigners after Byron (Bairan) gave a brilliant description of its beauty.""

The other options are incorrect based on the provided passage:

* **A: Kaebo da Roka:** While the bus travels to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca, this isn't the reason for Sintra's popularity.
* **B: Mariya thumiyage darshana:** The passage mentions Fatima's shrine in the north, not connected to Sintra's fame.

* The passage *explicitly* says: ""kese vethath, kisindu sthaapitha jaathiyak - armeniyavavat - eya nila washayen piliganne naetha."" This translates to ""However, no established nation - not even Armenia - officially recognizes it (the new republic)"".

*   While the 1994 war (B) is a significant event related to the conflict, the ongoing conflict itself is the broader issue that continues to affect the relationship.
*   Raajyathanthrika tharka is a result of the naagorno-karabak kalaapaya

This translates to: ""In Charlotte, families generally do not use ride-sharing services. Because there is an extra charge for more than 2 passengers, it is an unnecessarily expensive option.""

This clearly indicates that the extra charge is triggered by having more than two passengers (implying three or more).

This translates to: ""Families in Charlotte generally do not use ride-hailing services. Because a surcharge appears if there are more than 2 passengers, it is an unnecessarily expensive option.""

Therefore, the disadvantage of living with children in Charlotte, according to the passage, is related to **B: kulee rathayak laba gaeneema (getting a ride-hailing service)** because it's more expensive due to the surcharge for more passengers.

* B: The Cook Islands are a self-governing island country in free association with New Zealand, implying it is its own state.
* D: The Cook Islands doesn't have any city, which is not specified whether this applies to Hawaii."
kuk doopath niwaeradiwa visthara nokaranne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: ehi pradhaana nagara wanne raarotonga saha ayitutaki ya**

Here's why:

* **The passage clearly states that Cook Islands do NOT have any cities (nagarayak nomaeti).** Rorotonga and Aitutaki are identified as the main islands, but not as cities.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the provided text:

* **A: eya hawayi walata wadaa kudaayi (It is smaller than Hawaii):** The passage implies this by saying it is small (""kudaa vuvat..."") and evokes a memory of Hawaii before major tourist development.
* **B: eya doopath samoohayaki (It is an archipelago):** The passage explicitly states it's a group of 15 islands (""dupath 15 kin yuth dupath samuhayaki"").
* **D: mema doopath raajyaya hawayi walata samana kala kalaapayak beda ganee (This island nation shares a similar climate zone to Hawaii):** The passage states it has a climate similar to Hawaii (""Hawaay valata samaana kaala kalaapayak sahitha..."").

nawathaen vikalpa dekak idiripath karanne pahatha sandahan wana ud‍yaana palaka madyasthaana walin sthaanawalin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirenaa**.

The text explicitly states: ""Sirinaa yanu kandavuru baendimata amatharava, nidanashaala navaathaen saha unusum kaemabima pirinamana ekama udyaana paalaka madyasthaanayay.""

This translates to: ""Sirena is the only park ranger station that offers accommodation and hot meals, in addition to booking campsites.""

"mema chedayata anuwa, obata kredit kadapath wenuwata mudal bhaavitha kirimata awashya nam obata ud‍yaana balapathrayak wen karawa gatha haekke kothaeninda?","The correct answer is **B: Puverto Jimenes**.

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Puverto jimenes hi udyaana paalaka madyasthaanayen rijuvama udyaana avasarapath labaa gaenimata haeki namuth, ovuhu credit card baara ganne naetha."" This translates to: ""In Puerto Jimenez, you can directly obtain a park pass from the park ranger station, but they do not accept credit cards.""
*   This directly implies that Puerto Jimenez allows you to purchase the pass with cash (since they don't accept credit cards).
*   Sirena does not accept credit cards and therefore cannot be an option.
*   La Liyona does not sell park passes.
*   Cafenet El Sol accepts credit cards, so it cannot be the answer."
"mema chedayata anuwa, baewum sahitha bhoomiyaka kumana aakaraye skee kreedaawak sidu karanneda?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: pitisara skee kreedaawa (backcountry skiing)**.

Here's why:

*   The text describes a type of skiing that takes place ""devaenna baevum sahitha bhumiyaka"" (on terrain with slopes/inclines), which is characteristic of backcountry skiing.
*   It contrasts this type of skiing with alpine skiing (""alphyne shailiye""), which is typically done on groomed slopes.
*   It mentions the need for ""vadaa shaktimath hima matha lissahyana upakarana saha boot sapaththu"" (more robust skis and boots), which are also common requirements for backcountry skiing.
*   The entire passage explains how this type of skiing differs from typical alpine skiing, ski touring, or hiking. It emphasizes traveling over uneven terrain, covering greater distances than walking, and encountering ungroomed areas. All these are trademarks of backcountry skiing.

Therefore, ""pitisara skee kreedaawa"" or Backcountry Skiing is the most fitting answer."
"mema chedayata anuwa, ihala wegayakata langaa weemata kaemathi pitisara skee kreedakayinta upakara kala haekke kumakda?","The passage says that powerful skis and boots are required for ski touring. High speeds are rarely achieved on groomed trails due to powder. Therefore, the best answer is:

**A: daedi boot sapaththu** (Strong boots)
"
naewatha aethulweeme kampaanaya athvindina sanchaarakayinta apahasu kalayak wanne kumak kirimata da?,"The correct answer is **D: owunge mul sanskruthiyata naewatha anuwarthanaya weema** (Adapting back to their original culture).

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses the difficulties travelers face not just adapting to a *new* culture (A), but specifically *re-adapting* to their *own* culture after living abroad. The passage explicitly states that some habits learned abroad might be lost when they return to their home country.
*   While patience and understanding (B) are helpful, they are not the primary difficulty the passage focuses on. They describe how others *should* behave, not what the traveler struggles with.
*   Traveling abroad (C) is the *cause* of the re-entry shock, not the difficulty itself."
"mema chedayata anuwa, naewatha aethulweeme kampaanaya visheshayen dushkara viya haekke kumana aakaraye sanchaarakayekuta da?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: videshayaka jiwath wana vita wegawathwa anuwarthanaya wana sanchaarakayinta (those who quickly adapt while living abroad).**

Here's why:

* **The passage highlights the challenges faced by travelers returning home after living abroad.** It states that those who have adapted to a new culture and shed some old habits while abroad may find it difficult to readjust to their native culture.
* **Option B directly aligns with this idea.** If someone quickly adapts to a foreign culture (videshayaka jiwath wana vita wegawathwa anuwarthanaya wana sanchaarakayinta), they are more likely to experience ""re-entry shock"" because they have significantly changed and may find it harder to fit back into their original cultural context.
* **Other options are not directly supported by the text:**
    * **A: visheshayen naraka sanskruthika kampaanaya athvindina sanchaarakayin (those who have experienced particularly bad culture shock):** While negative experiences may exist, the passage does not specifically mention that those types of travelers would have difficult re-adjusting to their culture, specifically.
    * **C: thawamath madhusamaya gatha karana sanchaarakayin (those who are still going through a medium period):** There is no information about the effects of an intermediate amount of time passing with culture shock as it relates to challenges readapting.
    * **D: adu iwaseemak aethi sanchaarakayin (those with low patience):** The passage does mention patience but it is not directly related to the re-entry difficulty.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer based on the provided passage.
"
minisun moos sathun samaga sidu kirimen waelakee sitiya yuththe pahatha sandahan karunu walin kawareda?,"The passage says that moose are usually not aggressive but will defend themselves if they feel threatened. It also states that people underestimate how dangerous moose can be and get too close, putting themselves at risk.

Therefore, the safest thing for people to do when interacting with moose is to **D: dura sita owun nireekshanaya kirima (observe them from a distance)**.  This minimizes the risk of the moose feeling threatened and reacting defensively.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: owunge paewaethma nosalaka haereema (Ignoring their personal space):** The passage implies the opposite - respecting their space is crucial.
*   **B: itha semin langaa weema (Approaching them slowly):** While seemingly cautious, even a slow approach can be perceived as a threat.
*   **C: owunge vibhavya tharjana mattama awama kirima (Minimizing their potential threat level):** This is vague. While you should avoid actions that would provoke a moose, the safest approach is still distance.

So the answer is D.

"mema chedayata anuwa, kaanthara sanchaarakayekuta awama washayen bhayaanaka wanu aeththe pahatha sandahan ewayen kawareda?","The passage states:

*   **""Giniyam divaa kaalaye, sanchaarakayinta jalaya aethibava mulakara penwana (ho wenath dae) miringu daekagatha haeki ya.""** (During the scorching daytime, travelers can see mirages that give the illusion of having water or something else.)
*   **""Magiyaa visin vatinaa shakthiya saha pavathnaa jala pramaanaya apathe harimin, miringuva pasupasa giyahoth maeva anathurudaayaka viya haekiya.""** (It can be dangerous if the traveler chases the mirage, wasting valuable energy and available water.)
*   **""Ushnaadhikama kaanthara vuvada rathriye adhika lesa sisil viya haekiya. unusum aendum rahithavita sarira ushnathwaya asaamanya lesa aduvima athishaya avadaanamaki.""** (Even though the desert is extremely hot, it can get very cold at night. It is extremely important to be careful if you don't have warm clothes because your body temperature can drop abnormally.)

Based on this, let's analyze the options:

*   **A: seethala raathriyaka unusum aendum nomaethi kama (Being without warm clothes on a cold night)** - This is explicitly mentioned as a dangerous situation in the passage.
*   **B: jalaya aethi bawa mulaakara penwana miriguwak daekeema (Seeing a mirage that gives the illusion of having water)** - Seeing a mirage itself isn't the danger; it's *chasing* it.
*   **C: miringuwak luhubaenda yamedee shakthiya naasthi kirima (Wasting energy chasing a mirage)** - This is dangerous, as stated in the passage.
*   **D: miringuwak luhubaenda yamedee jalaya naasthi kirima (Wasting water chasing a mirage)** - This is also dangerous, as stated in the passage.

The question asks for the MOST dangerous. While chasing a mirage (C & D) is risky, the passage *directly* emphasizes the danger of being without warm clothes on a cold desert night and the potential for a dangerously low body temperature. This makes that situation immediately life-threatening.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A**.
"
kaanthara sanchaarakayinta aethi viya haeki tharjanayak sandahan nokaranne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The passage discusses the dangers faced by desert travelers. Let's break down the relevant parts:

*   **Jala hingaya (A: Water shortage):** The passage mentions ""sanchaarakayinta jalaya aethibava mulakara penwana (ho wenath dae) miringu daekagatha haeki ya."" This implies water scarcity leads to hallucinations.

*   **Miringu (B: Mirage):** The passage explicitly states mirages can appear and mislead travelers, causing them to waste water and energy.

*   **Hayipothermiyawa (C: Hypothermia):** The passage mentions that deserts can get very cold at night (""Ushnaadhikama kaanthara vuvada rathriye adhika lesa sisil viya haekiya."") and without warm clothing, hypothermia is a risk (""unusum aendum rahithavita sarira ushnathwaya asaamanya lesa aduvima athishaya avadaanamaki."").

*   **Awwata pilisseema (D: Sunburn):** Although the passage mentions hot deserts, it doesn't directly address sunburn.

**Therefore, all the options A, B, and C are all threats that are mentioned in the passage.**

"mema chedayata anuwa, kaereebiyanuwan visin katha karana lada bhaashawa kumakda?","The correct answer is **D: arawakan**.

The passage states: ""kaeribvaru kri.poo 10,000 dee pamana paemini aravakan basa kathaa karana jana kotthaashayak vuha."" This translates to ""The Caribs arrived around 10,000 BC and were a group of people who spoke the Arawakan language.""

The passage states that in 1861, Norwegians opened the first skiing society in Australia as a recreational sport. Thus, they are credited with popularizing it as a recreational activity.

This translates to: ""As a sport of sliding down from a mountain, it dates back to the 17th century..."".

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: 17 wana siyavasa**.

Here's why:

*   The text mentions that Madagascar is unique in terms of wildlife and like its own continent.
*   It also mentions the small islands are independent or connected to France, luxury resorts.
*   There is also mention of islam spread to those islands.

Thus the answer is C.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: senasuraada raathree nonida siteema** (staying awake on Saturday night).
"
ikwadorayata aethulu weemedee yam yam awashyatha walakwa gaeneema sandaha kiyubanu purawaesiyekuta mulinma thibiya yuththe kumakda?,"Based on the passage provided, the correct answer is:

**B: neethyaanukoola aerayum lipiyak**

Here's why:

* The passage clearly states that ""Ikwadoraye visin apeksaa karayi"" (Ecuador requires).
* It goes on to say that ""Ikwadoraye videsha katayutu amaathyanshaya magin mema lipiya nithigatha kala yuthu athara, yam awashyathaavanta anukula viya yuthu ya.""
* In summary, the text explicitly mentions that a legally obtained *aerayum lipiyak* is what Ecuador requires for Cuban immigrants.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: sanchaaraya karana dinen obbata masa 6 kata wadaa walangu videsha gaman balapathrayak** (Foreign travel document valid for 6 months from the date of travel): While mentioned, this is a general requirement.
*   **C: raendee sitina kalaya sanaatha kirima sandaha yana ena idiriyata aethi gaman tikath pathak** (Return ticket): Another general requirement.
*   **D: eksath janapada green kadapathak** (United States green card): This is mentioned as the *reason* for the requirement, but not the requirement itself.  The Cuban citizen *with* the green card needs the specific documentation.
"
ikwadoraye gaman awashyatha sandaha nirmanaya kara nomaeththe monawada?,"Based on the provided text (P), the Ecuadorian travel requirements seem to be primarily aimed at:

*   **B: sanvidhaanaathmaka sankramana prawahayak pawathwa gaeneema (Maintaining an organized migratory flow).** The passage explicitly states that these requirements are ""designed to create an organized migratory flow between the two countries.""
*   **C: sanchaarakayekuge raendee siteeme kalaya thahawuru kirima (Ensuring the duration of a tourist's stay).** The passage requires a return/onward ticket to confirm the duration of stay.
*   **D: videsha gaman balapathrawala walangubhawaya sahathika kirima (Verifying the validity of foreign travel documents).** The passage mentions the passport needing to be valid for at least 6 months from the date of travel.

Option A is incorrect since, there is no mention of reducing the number of tourist.

Therefore, **B, C, and D** are supported by the text.
"
thama ratata wadaa videsheeya rataka waedi piriwaeyak daereemata siduwanu aeththe pahatha sandahan dae athurin kumak sandahada?,"The correct answer is **B: usas pele kannaadi raamu (high-end eyeglass frames)**

Here's why:

*   **The passage discusses the potential profitability of selling eyeglasses in low-income countries.**
*   **The passage specifically mentions ""usasalpele sannam raamu thula gaetalu dekak tibiya haekiya,"" which translates to ""there could be two problems with high-end eyeglass frames"" in those areas.**
*   **The problem identified are: fake/imitations, or high import costs**
*   **Therefore, high-end frames are more likely to be more expensive in a foreign country compared to the home country.**

Let's examine why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: akshi pareekshana (eye exams):** The passage mentions the possibility of getting an eye exam locally and a prescription from elsewhere. If available locally, eye exams wouldn't necessarily be more expensive abroad, and could even be cheaper.
*   **C: drushti rakshanaya (vision insurance):** Vision insurance schemes depend on location and are specific to that area; this does not mean they are higher in cost.
*   **D: welanda sannam nowana raamu (non-branded eyeglass frames):** This is less likely because non-branded frames are generally more affordable, and therefore less susceptible to high import costs or the existence of counterfeits.
"
videsheeya rataka usas pele kannaadi raamu miladee gaeneeme avadaanamak viya haekke kumakda?,"The passage mentions two potential problems with buying high-end frames in countries with low labor costs and incomes:

1.  Some may be imitations (anukarana viya haekiya)
2.  Even genuine imported frames might be more expensive than buying them within the country (rata thula evata vadaa milen waedi viya haekiya).

Therefore, option **C: ewa vyaaja ewa viya haekiya (they could be fake)** is the most direct and relevant answer to the question about potential risks when buying high-end frames in a foreign country.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that while the Falkland pound is used in the Falkland Islands, its value is equal to the British pound. It also says that Stanley often accepts credit cards and US dollars. Therefore, A and B are incorrect.

*   The passage explicitly states that you *cannot* exchange Falkland pounds outside the islands, meaning you must exchange them *before* leaving. Therefore, C is incorrect.

*   The passage says, ""Dupatvala onaema thaenaka brithaanya pavum piligannaa athara, staenly thula boho vita kredit kaad saha aemerikaanu dollar da piliganu labai"" which translates to ""British pounds are accepted everywhere on the island, while credit cards and American dollars are often accepted in Stanley."" This implies that while the Falkland pound is the local currency, the British pound is also widely accepted and understood. Therefore, D is the most accurate statement."
"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, eksath janapadaye sita fokland wetha sanchaaraya karana vita, kredit kadapathak haera wenath geweem kramayak visheshayen prayojanawath viya haekke kothaenada?","Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **D: Staenli puraawata (Stanley throughout)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Stanley accepts credit cards and US dollars widely, unlike Dupatvala which primarily accepts British Pounds. Since you're traveling from the US, using US Dollars would be easier in Stanley.
*   The text says ""staenly thula boho vita kredit kaad saha aemerikaanu dollar da piliganu labai"" which means ""In Stanley, credit cards and US Dollars are widely accepted.""
*   The text also says that other islands (Dupatvala) primarily accept British Pounds.

Therefore, using something *other* than a credit card would be most useful in Stanley because US Dollars are widely accepted there. The passage implies you'll likely need cash elsewhere."

*   The deity's birthday (dewathaviyakage upandinaya)
*   Important events related to the temple (dewasthaanayata sambandha pradhaana siduweem)

The passage does **not** mention a festival being related to:

*   An elephant's birthday (aliyekuge upatha)

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: aliyekuge upatha**"
saerasili kara aethi ali aethun naerabimata haekke kothaenada?,"Based on the provided text, the best answer is **C: pansal uthsawa perahaera waladee**

Here's why:

*   The text specifically mentions ""Saerasili kala ali aetun sahitha deergha perahaerak,"" indicating decorated elephants are part of temple festival processions.
*   ""Kovil"" translates to temple, and ""uthsawa"" translates to festival.

Therefore, decorated elephants are seen in temple festival processions.

Let's analyze why the other options are not as suitable:

*   **A: nowaembar aga sita maeyi maeda dakwa saema thaenakama** (Everywhere from late November to mid-May): While the text mentions this period for festivals, it does not mean you can see decorated elephants everywhere.
*   **B: kovil wala** (In temples): The elephants are not generally found within the temples. They are part of the processions.
*   **D: keralaye weediwala** (On the streets of Kerala): The elephants are not simply on the streets. They are part of the processions during festivals."
"mema chedayata anuwa, vyaapara ho palamu panthiye prawesha pathrawala mudal ithiri kara gaeneemata boho durata ida aeththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The passage states that looking for discounts on business or first-class tickets is futile. It also states that business and first-class tickets cost significantly more than standard fare (4x and 11x respectively).

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: obe samaagama haraha eya viyadam kirima (Paying through your company):** The passage does mention this, but not as a *saving* option. It says that either you pay, or your company pays. There's no implication that this saves money.
*   **B: vyaapaara panthiya wenuwata palamu panthiya wenkarawa gaeneema (Booking first class instead of business class):** The passage explicitly says first class is even more expensive than business class.
*   **C: riju nowana palamu panthiye guvan gamanak wenkarawa gaeneema (Booking a non-direct first-class flight):** While the passage discusses direct flights and the ""privilege"" of arriving quickly and easily, it doesn't imply that a non-direct flight in first class is a saving option. In fact, it still involves paying the premium for first class.
*   **D: wattam aethi daeyi soya baeleema (Looking for discounts):** The passage explicitly says, ""...wattam aetidaeyi baelima pawaa nishphala kriyaawaki,"" which translates to ""...even looking for discounts is a futile activity.""

Since looking for discounts is described as a waste of time/futile, none of the given options is expected to work. The passage doesn't provide alternative ways to save on business or first-class travel. Therefore, based on the available information, the closest answer would be D. However, it's not because it saves money, but because all other options are more expensive or ineffective at saving money.

So, based on the text, the answer is **D: wattam aethi daeyi soya baeleema (Looking for discounts),** even though it is acknowledged to be futile.

The passage specifically says to add extra costs like visas, departure taxes, and ground transportation **for destinations outside of Africa**.  An African visa would be a cost *within* Africa, not an extra cost related to going somewhere *outside* of Africa.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, supiri welandasael wadaath vividhaakara thereemak laba deemata patan gena aeththe kumak sandahada?","The correct answer is **A: soodaanam kala aahara (prepared foods)**

The passage explicitly states ""Supiri velaendasaelvala vividhaakara lesa soodaanam kala aahara  waedi vaediyen ganimin pawathee."" which translates to ""Supermarkets increasingly offer a diverse range of prepared foods."" This indicates that supermarkets have started offering a more diverse selection for prepared foods.
"

This translates to: ""Supermarkets readily offer a variety of prepared foods. Some even provide microwave ovens or other methods for heating the food.""

Therefore, microwave ovens are a facility provided by some supermarkets that encourages consumers to buy prepared food. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: e-thulama aethi awanhal:** This refers to ""scales with tills"" or similar technologies which helps with payment and are not directly related to encouraging prepared food purchases.
*   **B: adu vividhaakara thoraa gaeneem:** This means ""less diverse choices"" which would *discourage* purchases.
*   **C: amu aahara:** This means ""raw food"" which is not prepared food."

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""beljiyame saha svitsarlanthaye kathaa kerena pransha bhaashave ankana kramaya pranshaye kathaa kerena pransha bhaashave evaata vadaa madak asaamaanyathavan aethi athara aetaem wachana uchcharanaya tharamak wenaswe."" This directly translates to: ""The accent in French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland is somewhat different from the French spoken in France, and the **emphasis/accentuation of certain words is slightly different**.""

Therefore, the most difficult thing for French speakers from Belgium and Switzerland to understand would be the differences in pronunciation, specifically the emphasis or accentuation of words.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sammatha pransha ankana kramaya** (Standard French grammar): The text says that Belgians and Swiss speakers are taught Standard French, so they *can* understand it.
* **B: suvisheshee pransha wachana** (Specific French words): While there might be some regional vocabulary, the main problem is the *pronunciation* differences, not necessarily unique words.
* **D: pranshaye waedipurama katha kerena pransha bhaashawa** (French spoken in France): This is what they are *being* compared to, and while there are differences, they should still be able to understand it.
"
pranshaye beljiyamata ho svitsarlanthayata wadaa wenas wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: ankana kramaya (spelling/writing system)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Samasthayak lesa, beljiyame saha svitsarlanthaye kathaa kerena pransha bhaashave **ankana kramaya** pranshaye kathaa kerena pransha bhaashave evaata vadaa madak asaamaanyathavan aethi athara aetaem wachana uchcharanaya tharamak wenaswe."" (Overall, the **spelling/writing system** of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland is somewhat more unusual than that of French spoken in France, and the pronunciation of certain words is slightly different).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: siyalu wachana wala uchchaaranaya (pronunciation of all words):** The passage states that the *pronunciation of certain words* is different, not all words.
* **C: pasalwala uganwanu labana sammatha pransha bhaashawa (standard French taught in schools):** The passage indicates that Belgians and Swiss *can* learn standard French, implying it is taught in schools.
* **D: samahara pransha wachanawala akshara vin‍yasaya (spelling of some French words):** While spelling variations *can* occur within any language, the passage *specifically* calls out the broader writing system as being different, making option B the most accurate reflection of what the passage states.

viyo guvan gaasthuwak laba gaeneemata obata nohaeki wanne kumana awasthaawedee da?,"The correct answer is **B: thewana parshweeya sewaawak wenuwata oba guvan samaagama samaga rijuwama wenkarawa gaeneemata uthsaha karanne nam**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Thawamath guvan samaagam kihipayak pamanak avasan avasthaave avamangalya gamanaagamana pirivaeya sandaha sulu vattam labaadena, viyo guvan gaasthu labaadhe."" (Only a few airlines offer small discounts for last-minute travel arrangements and don't provide wholesale airfare discounts.)

*   This implies that trying to book directly with the airline (as suggested in option B) will *not* get you wholesale airfare discounts (viyo guvan gaasthu labaadhe).

The other options mention specific airlines (WestJet, Lufthansa, Delta) which are listed as examples of airlines that *do* offer some discounts but *don't* offer wholesale prices. They are irrelevant to the main cause of when wholesale prices can't be achieved."
viyo guvan gaasthuwa pilibandawa sathyaya wanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: ewa guvan samaagama samaga rijuwama durakathanaya haraha wenkarawa gatha yuthuya**.

The passage states: ""Saemavitama, oba guvan samaagama samaga rijuwa durakathanaya haraha aasana ven karava gatha yuthu ya."" This directly translates to ""Always, you must reserve seats directly through the airline by telephone.""  This confirms option D.
"
Gps sanchaalana yedumakata wadaa thani jipeees upaangayak bhaavitha kirima pahasu wanne kawadada?,"The passage states: ""Obey durakathanayata daththa sambandhataavak nomaeti nam ho eya sangna paraasayen pitatha nam, evaye kriyaakaaritvaya seema weema ho lada nohaeki weema sidu viya haekiya."" This translates to: ""If your phone does not have a data connection or is out of signal range, its functionality may be limited or unavailable.""

The question asks: ""When is it easier to use a standalone GPS device than a GPS navigation app?""

Based on the passage, the lack of data or signal limits phone GPS app functionality. Therefore, the best answer is when you are out of signal range.

So the answer is **C: oba sanngaa paraasayen pitathata yana vita (when you are out of signal range)**.
"
thani upakaranayakata sapekshawa jipeees sanchaalana yeduma bhaavitha kirimata honda hethuwak nowanne kumak da?,"The correct answer is **A: daththa sambandhathawayak pilibanda karadara viya yuthu naetha** (not having to worry about a data connection).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Obey durakathanayata daththa sambandhataavak nomaeti nam ho eya sangna paraasayen pitatha nam, evaye kriyaakaaritvaya seema weema ho lada nohaeki weema sidu viya haekiya."" (If your phone does not have a data connection or is out of signal range, its functionality may be limited or unavailable).
* **Question Q asks:** What is *not* a good reason to use a GPS navigation app compared to a dedicated device?
* **Option A directly addresses the limitation of GPS apps needing a data connection.** Dedicated GPS devices don't rely on data for navigation in the same way. This makes A the answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: mudal ithiri kirima (saving money):** The passage explicitly states that using a phone's GPS (presumably over buying a dedicated device) can save money.
* **C: kuliyata gaeneemen waelakee siteema (avoiding renting):** The passage implies that you might rent a dedicated GPS device, which a phone app avoids.
* **D: nawa sithiyam miladee gaeneemata awashya noweema (not needing to buy new maps):**  The passage mentions not needing to buy new maps, implying this is an advantage of a phone app.

Therefore, A is the only option that presents a *disadvantage* of using a GPS app compared to a standalone GPS device.  A standalone device isn't crippled by the lack of a data connection.
"
mema chedayata anuwa obata wadaathma yogya nawkawak samaga gaelapena bawa sahathika kala haekke keseda?,"The passage states that you should ""Ensure that your representative is a Galapagos specialist with good knowledge of the various types of ships in a large range."" This directly relates to option C.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: galapagos sanchaara visheshangayeku haraha wen karawa gaeneema**.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, aaganthukayan sooduwa digatama karagena yamata ida salasana upaya maargayak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","Let's analyze the passage and the question.

The passage describes places (likely casinos) where visitors are encouraged to stay longer and spend more money.  Key features include:

*   No clocks or windows to disorient them.
*   Difficult to find exits.
*   Special food, drinks, and entertainment.
*   Keeping visitors in a good mood and comfortable.
*   Sometimes free alcohol is served, but skilled gamblers understand the importance of staying sober.

The question asks which option is **NOT** a way to keep visitors gambling longer.

*   **A: swabhavika aalokaye bahulathwaya (Abundance of natural light):** The passage states there are no windows, implying a lack of natural light. Natural light helps people keep track of time and connect to the outside world, potentially leading them to leave sooner.
*   **B: nomile sangeetha prasanga praweshapath waeni diri deemanaa (Free entrance to musical performances and other incentives):** This is a form of entertainment that encourages people to stay.
*   **C: nomile mad‍yasara beema (Free alcoholic drinks):** The passage mentions alcohol is sometimes served to loosen inhibitions and encourage spending (although skilled gamblers avoid it).
*   **D: oralosu nomaethi weema (Absence of clocks):** Clocks help people keep track of time. Without them, it is easy to lose track of time.

Therefore, natural light (option A) is the only one that would not encourage people to stay longer. It could in fact encourage them to leave.

**So the answer is A.**"
"ema chedayata anuwa, daksha soodukaruweku walakwa gatha yuththe kumakda?","The passage states that ""clever gamblers"" understand the importance of staying sober, as alcohol impairs judgement.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: adhika lesa mathpaen paanaya kirima (excessive alcohol consumption)**
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, waak‍yayaka maeda kaepital akurin liyawena wachana panthiya kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: naama pada**.

The passage states that in the discussed writing style, *every noun in a sentence is started with a capital letter*. The other options (verbs, adjectives, and adverbs) are not mentioned as being capitalized.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, naama padayak kaepital akurin liweema magin wadaath apahasu wanne kumak da?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: liweema (writing)**.

The passage states: ""emagin kriyaa padayak ho naama visesanayak bhaavitha karanu labanne svaadhina aakarayen da yanna soyaagaeneeme awashyathaava hetuven liweema tharamak sankirna karavayi.""

This translates to: ""but it complicates writing somewhat because of the need to find out whether a verb or adjective is used independently through it"".

Therefore, writing is made more difficult by capitalizing nouns.
"
"maelesiyawe graameeya pradeshawala, “enna” yanna adahas karanne kumana abhinaya magin da?","Based on the provided text (P), the correct answer is:

**B: atha waeneema**

The text states ""...maeleysiawehi, grameeya pradeshawalawath maelaevarun athara ho, in pavasanne """"mehi enna"""" yanna wana athara, dabara aegilla sirura desata naemeema magin prakaasha kerena..."" which translates to ""...in rural areas of Malaysia, it is said to mean ""come here"" through a hand wave...""
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, “aapasu enna” yanna adahas karanne kumana abhinaya maginda?","The correct answer is **A: athla thaman desata harawa atha waeneema**.

The passage states that a British tourist in Spain might misunderstand the gesture of waving with the palm facing towards oneself (athla thaman desata harawa atha waeneema) as meaning ""come back"" (aapasu paeminimata).
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, irithaeleem walata hethu wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: hima paalam** (ice bridge).

The passage states: ""memagin hima paalam valin saengavi giya iritaeleem..."" which translates to ""Because of the melting ice bridge, the collapse of the ice cavern...""
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, hima paalamen saengaviya haekke kawareda?","The text states ""memagin hima paalam valin saengavi giya **iritaeleem**"".

Therefore, the answer is **A: irithaeleem**.
"
"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, sanchaarakayin kumana sthaanayata paemineemata pera amathara poorwarakshaka piyawara gatha yuthuda?","The correct answer is **B: gomaa wataa aethi pradeshayan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gomaa saelakiya yuthu tharam aarakshitha vuvat, uthuru kivu palaate pawathina gaetumvala thatvaya avabodha karagaenimata **gomaavalin pitataa sanchaarayan paryeshanayata lak kala yutuya**.""

This translates to: ""Although Gomaa is reasonably safe, to understand the situation prevailing in the North Kivu province, **travel outside of Gomaa should be researched**.""

This implies that extra precautions are needed before venturing *outside* of Gomaa, into the surrounding areas, to understand the security situation in North Kivu.
"
gomaa hi sanchaaraya karana sanchaarakayin sandaha honda upadesak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The best advice *NOT* for tourists in Goma, based on the text, is:

*   **A: uthuru kiwu hi satan itha sithgannaa sulu ya (The fighting in North Kivu is quite serious)**

**Explanation:**

*   The passage highlights the need for caution and research outside of Goma due to the situation in North Kivu. This implies that the conflict there is a serious concern.
*   The passage specifically mentions the presence of mountain gorillas, making option B appropriate.
*   The text describes ""boda-bodas"" (motorcycle taxis) and the cost of short trips, so this is reasonable advice.
*   The text notes that the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed much of Goma in 2002, indicating the proximity of the city to the volcano.

Therefore, while other options are valid and true, mentioning conflict/fighting provides little guidance for a tourist, whereas the other options are helpful."
agosthu maasaye wana aarambhaka dinaya sandaha pradesheeya awasara pathak laba gatha haekiwanu aeththe kawadada?,"The passage states: ""Melesa, maeyi maasaye onaema aarambhaka dinayak sandaha wana praadeshiya avasara pathak janavari 1 wanada sita labaagata haeki ya."" This translates to: ""Thus, for any starting date in May, a regional opportunity permit can be obtained from January 1st.""

The key information is that you can apply 4 months prior to the start month, beginning on the 1st of that month.

So, if the starting month is August, you need to count back four months: July, June, May, April. Thus, you can get the permit starting April 1st.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: aprel 1 wana da**.
"
kaeniyan aarakshaa kirima sandaha kriyathmaka karana lada prathipaththiya kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: seemitha awasara path sankyawak (limited number of permits)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that opportunities are limited and that popular locations like Bright Angel Campground near Phantom Ranch fill up quickly on the first day they open for reservations. This indicates that the availability is limited.

Let's analyze why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: palamuwa paemini ayata palamuwa awasarapath laba deeme kriyawaliya (first come, first served system)**: While the passage does mention ""palamuwa paeminennata palamuwa labaadena padanama matha (first come, first served basis)"", this is the *method* of distribution, not necessarily the overarching policy to conserve Kenya.
*   **B: awasara path laba gatha haekke janawaari 1 wana dina pamani (permits can be obtained on January 1st only)**: The passage says permits *become available* on January 1st for starting dates in May. It doesn't mean that's the *only* day to get them.
*   **C: awasara path laba gatha haekke pudgalikawa paemina ayadum kirima haraha pamani (permits can be obtained by applying in person only)**: The passage doesn't mention anything about in-person applications being the *only* way to get permits.

Therefore, the most direct and relevant answer is **D**. The limited number of permits are part of a policy that actively works to conserve Kenya."
mema chedaye visthara kara aethi hotal wargawala awama washayen soya gaeneemata ida aeththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"Based on the provided passage, the answer is **C: prasiddha ho handunaagatha haeki sesu aaganthukayan (famous or recognizable affluent guests)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states the hotel was intended to accommodate *ekala dhanavat ha prasiddha pudgalayinta navaathaen gaenimata wana athara* (wealthy and famous individuals).

The other options are possible but less directly supported by the text:

*   **A: koktel baar ekak (Cocktail Bar)** - The passage mentions ""shobana bhojana saha raathri sada paewathini"" (elegant dinners and night parties), implying a bar could exist, but it's not explicitly stated.
*   **B: ema sthaanayema aethi gormut awanhalak (Gourmet Restaurant)** - The passage mentioned ""shobana bhojana"" indicating an elegant restaurant.
*   **D: naweena waedidiyunu kirim sahitha maethakadee naweekaranaya karana lada kamara (Rooms with modern improvements and occasional renovations)** - The passage mentions ""*Navina pahasukam nomaetikama saha yam sundara vayasgatabhaavayak da evaye svabhaavaye ma kotasaki*"", suggesting that a combination of modern facilities, comfort, and some beautiful aging are the characteristics of it. While renovations might occur, the emphasis is on maintaining the character of the old era.

Therefore, the most accurate answer, directly inferred from the text, is **C**."
"mema chedaye dakwa aethi thorathuru walata anuwa, hotal aaganthukayan awama pramukhathawaya deemata ida aeththe pahatha sandahan pirinaemeem walin kawareda?","The correct answer is **D: daeriya haeki kaamara gaasthu (affordable room rates)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on luxury and exclusivity.** It mentions wealthy and famous individuals staying at the hotel, elaborate dinners, and nightlife. It also describes a ""golden age"" of steam trains and sea travel, implying a time of affluence.  It emphasizes the hotel's role in catering to the elite.

* **The implication is that staying at this type of hotel was expensive.** Therefore, affordable room rates (daeriya haeki kaamara gaasthu) would be the *least* likely amenity that the hotel would prioritize for its guests. All other options were actually promoted according to the original text.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: hotalaya puraawatama pawuraanika gruha bhaanda (The hotel's ancient historical furniture):** The passage explicitly mentions its ""old-world charm"" (""parana thalaye"") as a key aspect.
*   **B: keerthimath supawediyaku samaga awanhalak (A meal with a celebrity chef):** The passage references ""shobana bhojana"" (elaborate dinners) which suggests high-quality food, potentially with a renowned chef.
*   **C: raathree vinodaswadaya laba dena viwekagarayak (A private suite that provides nightlife):**  The text notes ""raathri sada paewathini"" (night parties were held), suggesting nightlife and private areas.

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states:** *""""ihalin pawasana lada paridi, aemarika eksath janapadaye """"""""eskimo' yana wachanaya piliganu laebuwa da, visesayen ma kaenadaawa waeni amaricanu novena aaktik janathaava bohomayak eya avamaanaatmaka yaeyi salakati.""""""* Which translates to, ""As mentioned earlier, while the word ""Eskimo"" is accepted in the United States, many non-American Arctic peoples, especially those in Canada, consider it derogatory."" The passage then goes on to say how Greenland's indigenous people refer to themselves.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ihala aparaadha anupathayan sandaha prasiddha samahara pradesha** (Some areas known for high crime rates) - The passage directly contradicts this, saying *""Aparaadha saha poduve videsikayan kerehi aethi akaemaetta saamanyayen greenlanthaya thula daknata nomaeta. nagaravala pavaa """"avadaanam sthaana"""" nomaeta.""* (Crime and general unkindness towards foreigners are generally not seen in Greenland. Even in cities there are no ""dangerous places"".)
*   **B: awurudda puraa deshagunaya saaman‍yayen unusum wana baevin bara aendum raegena ema** (Bringing heavy clothing due to the weather being generally warm throughout the year) - This is the opposite of what the passage advises. It states *""Oba seethala irthuwala dee grinlantayata paeminenne nam (oba thavat uthurata yana bawath eya thavat seethala bawath adahas kara), pramaanavat tharam unusum aendum gena yaama athyavasyay.""* (If you are coming to Greenland in cold weather (which means you are going further north and it will be colder), it is essential to bring adequate warm clothing.)
*   **C: antharjala sambandhathawaya durwala viya haeki baevin ehi sitiyadee waeda kirimata balaaporoththu weema** (Expecting to work while there because internet connectivity may be weak) - The passage says *""""Obey hotelaye ho satkaarakayan (nivadu niketanayaka ho paudgalika nivasaka raendi city nam) laga bohovita wifi sambandhataavayak ho antharjaalayata sambandha woo pariganakayak tibiya yuthu athara, siyalu janaavasavala antharjaala avanhalak ho podu wifi sthaanayak atha.""* (""Your hotel or accommodation (resort or private residence) in a city is likely to have a Wi-Fi connection or an internet-connected computer, and all inhabited areas have internet access or a public Wi-Fi spot."") This suggests that internet connectivity is generally available."
"mema chedayata anuwa, soodaanamakin thorawa greenlanthayata paeminena sanchaarakayin sandaha gaetalu sahagatha viya haekke pahatha sandahan karunu atharin kawareda?","The passage mentions that ""The only real danger faced by visiting tourists is the cold climate."" It also states ""During autumn, be aware of Nordic mosquitoes.""

daen madhyama welanda sankeernaya lesa bhaavitha karanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: jardin di laa yuniyan**.

The passage states: ""Eya daen madyama velanda sankeernayak lesa kriyaatmaka wana athara"" which translates to ""It currently functions as a central commercial complex."" The ""Eya"" is referring to ""Jaadin de lae uniyan.""
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, jardin di laa yuniyan hi soyagatha nohaekke pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","Based on the passage, the Jardin de la Union used to be a convent building (kanyaaraamayak sandaha aalindayak). It's now a busy commercial complex. The other options are mentioned in the passage:

*   **A: sangeetha prasanga sahitha madhyama mandapaya (musical performances with a central pavilion)** - This is mentioned (""nomile prasanga paewaethway"").
*   **B: paerani aadara andarayaka niwaahana (residence of an ancient couple)** - Described as two sandals separated by 69 senimeters that reside near an old couple's abode.
*   **C: ud‍yaanayata muhunalaa aethi awanhal (awnings facing the garden)** - Mentioned as surrounding the garden (""Udyaanaya vata karagat avanhal raashiyak aethi"").

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: paerani konwant godanaegillak (old convent building)** - The text says it *was* a convent building, not that it *is* currently. So, that is not a current attribute."
"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, dinaka kandu naegeema pilibanda pahatha sandahan prakaashayangen niwaeradi nowana bawa salakanu labana prakaashaya kawareda?","Let's analyze the passage and the statements to find the incorrect one.

Translation of the passage:
""Mountain climbing in a natural environment, especially exploring routes for climbing mountains, is an exciting activity. A one-day mountain climbing involves a shorter distance than an expedition that can be covered in one day. A little preparation is required for an easy hike, and anyone of moderate health can enjoy it. Families with young children may need more preparation, but even with toddlers and preschoolers, a one-day expedition can be done relatively easily.""

Now let's analyze the options:

*   **A: pahasuwen gaman kala haeki manpeth wala dinaka kandu naegeema sandaha sulu soodaanamak awashya we:** ""A little preparation is required for a one-day mountain climb on easily accessible paths.""  The passage states that ""A little preparation is required for an easy hike..."", so this statement is true.

*   **B: dura wenas we, namuth eya ek dinak thula aawaranaya kirimata adahas kere:** ""The distance varies, but it is intended to be covered in one day.""  The passage mentions that a one-day climb is shorter than a multi-day expedition, so this statement is true.

*   **C: madhyastha washayen sawukya sampannawa sitina pudgalayinta mema kriyaakaarakama rasa vindeemata haekiya:** ""A person who is moderately healthy can enjoy this activity."" The passage states that ""anyone of moderate health can enjoy it"", so this statement is true.

*   **D: dinaka kandu naegeema kudaa daruwan sitina pawul sandaha sudusu elimahan kriyaakaarakamak nowe:** ""One-day mountain climbing is not a suitable recreational activity for families with young children."" The passage states, ""...families with young children may need more preparation, but even with toddlers and preschoolers, a one-day expedition can be done relatively easily,"" contradicting the statement.

Therefore, the statement that is NOT true according to the passage is D.

**Final Answer: D**
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, dinaka kandu naegeema sandaha itha awama soodaanamak awashya wanne kawadada?","The correct answer is **C: lamayin kandu naegeemata yana vita (when children are going mountain climbing)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Kudaa daruvan sahitha pavulvalata wadi soodaanam weemak awashya viya haekiya"" which translates to ""Families with young children may need more preparation"". This directly links the need for *more* preparation to the presence of children.
* Options A and B state when mountain climbing is easy.
* Option D discusses that natural environments are easy.
"
norwe hi anekuth pradesha ha sasandana vita rogaland ho aegdel saanuwa hi aethi wenasa kumakda?,"Based on the provided text (P), the difference between the slopes of Rogaland and Agder compared to other regions in Norway is that they are ""often called 'hei,' which generally means barren land covered in heather.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **D: ewa boho vita hedar walin aawaranaya wee aetha** (They are often covered in heather)."
"mema chedayata anuwa, norwehi saaman‍ya lakshanayak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","Based on the provided text (P), let's analyze each option:

*   **A: viwurtha bhoomi pradesha (Open land area):** The text states, ""saanuva boho vita haedinvenne pulul, vivurta gas rahitha avakaashayak...yana arthaya aethi 'viddae' yanuveni"" which translates to ""The slope is often a wide, open, treeless area...meaning 'viddae'."" So, this IS a common characteristic.

*   **B: wanaanthara saanuwa (Forest slope):** The passage directly states ""...vivurta gas rahitha avakaashayak..."" meaning ""...open, treeless area..."". Thus, a forest slope contradicts this description, and this is likely the answer.

*   **C: baewum sahitha kandu athara patu kalapu (Narrow valleys between mountains with bogs):** The first sentence, ""Baevum kandu kalapu saha ihala, samathalaa bhava waedi ho adu saanuvak aethi kirimata ikmanin ida salasana nimna yanu norvaey hata saamaanya eva wei,"" indicates bogs, valleys and mountainous regions are common in Norway.

*   **D: moorlands:** The text mentions ""Rogaland saha Aegdarhi eva saamanyayen 'hei' washayen handunvana athara bohovita haedar valin vaesunu shaakha rahitha gohoru bima yana arthaya dei,"" which means ""Rogaland and Aegdarhi are commonly known as 'hei', which often means barren land covered in heather."" Moorland is a similar concept, therefore it's a common characteristic.

Therefore, the answer is **B: wanaanthara saanuwa (Forest slope)**. The text emphasizes that these landscapes are treeless, making a forest slope an uncommon characteristic."
skee kreedaawata unanduwak dakwana sanchaarakayin kandukara sthaanawalata paeminiya yuththe kawadada?,"The correct answer is **A: sheetha irthuwe dee**.

This directly implies winter is the best time for activities related to snow, like skiing.
* **The question:** ""Skee kreedaawata unanduwak dakwana sanchaarakayin kandukara sthaanawalata paeminiya yuththe kawadada?"" translates to ""When should tourists interested in skiing visit mountainous regions?""

Therefore, the most logical and supported answer from the passage is winter.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, kandukara sthaanawala saaman‍yayen waedima sanchaarakayin pramaanayak sitinne kawadada?","The correct answer is **C: indiyaanu sarath irthuwe dee**.

Here's why:

*   **P** states that tourist season is at its peak in mountain areas during the **Indian autumn/fall (Indiyaanu sarath srituvae)**.

Therefore, the answer that best reflects the peak tourist season is **C**."
oba udaw sandaha bottuwak soya gaeneemata balaaporoththu wanne nam oba kumak kirimen waelakee sitiya yuthuda?,"Based on the first paragraph (P), which describes efforts to find a boat by interacting with people, avoiding option D (ignoring other boat occupants) is the most relevant action to avoid. The passage emphasizes talking to people and building connections to find a potential boat.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: bottuwe gaman karana sesu aya nosalaka haereema (ignoring other boat occupants)**
"

Here's why:

*   Text P clearly emphasizes the importance of connecting with people in the harbor, especially sailors, to gain information and build relationships. The passage speaks to befriending sailors, talking to everyone, and developing connections with individuals working on yachts and vessels.
*   While options B, C, and D may be relevant considerations in general situations, they are not emphasized within the given text P. The text prioritizes communication and relationship-building."

This translates to: ""A large portion of Hong Kong Island's urban development is built on reclaimed land on the northern shore. This is where the British colonialists first took hold, and if you are looking for evidence of the land's colonial past, this is a good place to start.""

Therefore, the northern shore (uthuru werala) is the place that would interest visitors interested in colonial history."

ashwarohakayage paadaya pa patiyata hira weememe avadaanama awama kirimata upakaree wana saedalaye kotasa kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: aarakshitha theeru (protective stirrup)**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically mentions ""visesayen samahara ingrisi saedalavala, padavanna pitupasata aeddahot paa pati hama saedalayen gala wee yaamata upakaaree wana aarakshaka tiru aetha"" which translates to ""especially in some English saddles, there are protective stirrups that help the foot come free from the saddle if the rider falls."" This directly links the ""aarakshaka tiru"" (protective stirrup) to preventing the foot from getting stuck.

Let's eliminate the other options:

* **A: patu yati pathul (thin soles):** While thin soles are mentioned on boots, the passage doesn't directly connect them to a safety feature on the saddle itself.
* **C: sam paa pati (plain stirrup):** There's no discussion in the text about the properties of 'normal' stirrups reducing the risk. The opposite is implied, with the introduction of the *protective* stirrup.
* **D: waedi sthaawarathwayak (saddle stability):** Saddle stability is important for riding in general, but it is not specifically related to preventing the rider's foot from getting trapped in the stirrup during a fall.
"
paa pati bhaavitha karana vita asaruwage aarakshaawa waedi kirimata upakaree wana boot sapaththu wala kumana angayada?,"The text mentions that many riders wear boots with **thin soles** to help protect them.

So the correct answer is **A: ralu, patu pathula** (Rough, thin soles). The description includes both the terms mentioned in the text: ""usa adi saha sinindu, tharamak patu pathul sahitha"" (high heels and smooth, somewhat thin soles).
"

The text explicitly states that Aaganthuka satkaara huvamaru jaalayak (hospitality exchange network) is a mechanism to connect travelers with locals in a city for accommodation.  It's all about staying with locals (hospitality) while traveling. The other options are either byproducts (D) or motivations for creating the network (B), or not mentioned in the text (C).
"
"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, aaganthuka sathkara huwamaru jala sambandhayen sathya nowanne pahatha sandahan prakaashayangen kawareda?","Based on the passage, the statement that is NOT true regarding visitor hospitality exchange networks is:

**A: sanchaarakayinta saema vitama desheeya sathkarakayan wetha yomu kirim sidu karanu laebe** (Travelers are always referred to domestic hosts.)

Here's why:

The passage states that sometimes referrals and reviews from other travelers are also provided.  The ""sometimes"" implies it's NOT always the case that travelers are referred to domestic hosts. The other options are directly supported by the text.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A**.

Here's why:

* **P** states: ""Nevaasikaagaara mulika washayen tharuna udaviyata - navaathaen gannekuge saamanya vayasa visi ganan we""  This translates to: ""Hostels are mainly for young people - the average age of a visitor is in their twenties"".

Therefore, the most likely type of visitor you'd find in a hostel room is someone in their early twenties.
"
"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, nevaasikagarayaka raendee siteemata boho durata ida aeththe kawuda?","Based on the passage, the best answer is **C: 70 gananwala yuwalak (A couple in their 70s)**.

Here's why:

*   **P highlights:** The passage says ""vayasin waedi sanchaarakayin da obata evayehi dee nithara hamuviya haekiya"" (you can often meet older travelers there). This implies that older individuals are common at these types of accommodations.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: alutha upan bilindeku samaga gaman karana yuwalak (A couple traveling with a newborn baby):** The passage states that families with children are a ""durlabha dasunaki"" or a rare sight, which includes newborn babies, making this a less common scenario.
*   **B: ekata gaman karana 22 haeviridi thidenek (Three 22-year-olds traveling together):** While young people might stay at such a place, the passage specifically notes the presence of older travelers.
*   **D: daruwan samaga gaman karana pawul dekak (Two families traveling with children):** As mentioned earlier, children are a rare sight, so two families traveling together are even more improbable."
"mema chedayata anuwa, boomarang visi kirima niwaeradiwa visthara karanne pahatha sandahan prakaashawalin kawareda?","The correct answer is **D: aapasu aa haekke samahara boomarangwalata pamani** (Only some boomerangs can come back).

Here's why:

*   **P states:** ""Visi kala vita naewatha oba wethatama paeminena boomaranga visi kireema obata igenimata awashya nam, naewatha paeminimata sudusu sudusu boomarangayak oba sathuva aethi bavata sahatika karaganna. Owustreliyave daknata haeki boomarangawalin waedi hariyak apasu paemienenne naetha."" This directly translates to: ""If you want to learn to throw a boomerang that comes back to you when thrown, make sure you have a boomerang suitable for returning. Most of the boomerangs found in Australia do not return.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: niwaeradiwa visi kalahoth eya saemavitama obe athatama paeminenu aetha** (If thrown correctly, it will always come back to your hand) - The passage states that *only certain types of boomerangs* are designed to return, not that all boomerangs will return if thrown correctly. Even with the right boomerang, throwing it correctly is another factor, but the primary condition is the boomerang itself.
*   **B: eya sanchaarakayinta wadaa pradeshawaseen athara janapriya we** (It is more popular among locals than tourists) - This is not mentioned in the passage at all.
*   **C: ost‍reliyawe boho boomarang nomaetha** (There are many boomerangs in Australia) - The passage implies there *are* many boomerangs in Australia (""Most of the boomerangs found in Australia...""), but that most don't return. The problem is the return rate, not the existence of boomerangs.

Therefore, option D is the only accurate reflection of the information in the provided text."

The passage states: ""Bovena rogayak yanu asadita pudhgalayeku laga siteemen pahasuven walandiya haeki rogayaki."" This translates to: ""A communicable disease is a disease that can be easily contracted by being near an infected individual.""

Therefore, communicable diseases are spread through **infected individuals**.

A pathogen includes viruses, bacteria, fungi, and other parasites. Vaccination is a preventive measure against infectious diseases, not a cause.

Let's break down each option:

*   **A: Ennath (Vaccination):** Vaccination is a way to *prevent* illness, not cause it.
*   **B: Vairas (Virus):** Viruses are pathogens that cause infectious diseases.
*   **C: Baekteeriya (Bacteria):** Bacteria are also pathogens that cause infectious diseases.
*   **D: Dileera (Fungi):** Fungi are another type of pathogen that can cause infectious diseases."
athathya pudgalika jaala saepayumkaruweku wenuwata web proksiyak thoraa gaeneema parisheelakayata pramaanawath wanne kumana awasthaawedee da?,"Let's break down the passage and the question to find the best answer.

**Understanding the Passage (P):**

The passage argues that a commercial VPN (Virtual Private Network) is generally *better* than a web proxy for privacy and security for several reasons:

*   **Handles all internet data traffic:**  A VPN encrypts *all* data, not just HTTP traffic like a web proxy.
*   **Higher bandwidth and better service:** VPNs typically offer better performance.
*   **Encryption and difficult monitoring:**  VPNs encrypt data, making it harder to eavesdrop.

**Understanding the Question (Q):**

The question asks:  ""Under what circumstances would a *web proxy* be considered sufficient for a user *instead of* a VPN?""  Essentially, when would a web proxy be *good enough*?

**Analyzing the Options:**

*   **A: parisheelakayata siyalu gaman daththa prathiyomu kirimata awashya vita (When the user needs to reverse all traffic data):**  This is *incorrect*. The passage highlights that VPNs handle *all* traffic, while proxies typically only handle HTTP. Needing to reverse all traffic would be a reason to *choose a VPN*, not a web proxy. This translation is also slightly off, it should be encrypt not reverse.
*   **B: waaranaya saha oththu baeleema haekithak walakwa gaeneemata parisheelakaya saelakilimath wana vita (When the user is concerned about preventing censorship and monitoring):** This is *incorrect*. The passage directly states that VPNs are better at this due to encryption. The user needs to prevent these things.
*   **C: parisheelakayata pradhaana washayen antharjala gaman daththa prathiyomu kirimata awashya vita (When the user primarily needs to encrypt internet traffic):** This is the best answer. If the *primary* concern is encrypting *mostly* web traffic (HTTP), a web proxy might be sufficient.  It's not ideal, as a VPN offers more comprehensive protection, but in this limited scenario, it could be considered adequate.
*   **D: parisheelakayage kriyaakaarakam sandaha madhyastha sita ihala mattame kalaapa palalak awashya wana vita (When the user needs higher bandwidth than average for their activities):** This is *incorrect*. The passage states VPNs typically offer *better* bandwidth than proxies.

**Conclusion:**

Therefore, the best answer is **C**. A web proxy might be sufficient if the user *primarily* needs to protect web traffic, and isn't as concerned about other types of internet data."
"mema chedayata anuwa, athathya pudgalika jala saha web proksi pilibanda sathya nowanne pahatha sandahan prakaashawalin kawareda?","Correct Answer: **D: athathya pudgalika jaala hata antharjala gaman daththa pamanak prathiyomu kala haekiya**

Here's why:

*   **The Passage States:** ""Eva hetu kihipayak nisa web proxy valata vada hondaya: **http pamanak nova, siyaluma antharjaala dattha gaman eva pratiyomu karayi.**"" This means that VPNs (Athathya Pudgalika Jaala) redirect **all** internet data traffic, not just HTTP. Option D says only internet data traffic can be redirected which is incorrect as the passage is saying it redirects ALL internet data traffic.

*   **Other Options:**

    *   **A:** ""athathya pudgalika jaala saaman‍yayen web proksi walata wadaa waedi kalaapa palalak laba deyi"" - This is TRUE according to the passage: ""Ovun saamanyayen ihala kalaapa palalak saha vada honda sevaavak labaa dei."" (They generally provide higher bandwidth and better service).

    *   **B:** ""web proksi hata siyalu web gaman daththa prathiyomu kala nohaeka"" - This is TRUE according to the passage: ""http pamanak nova, siyaluma antharjaala dattha gaman eva pratiyomu karayi."" (Not just HTTP, but all internet data traffic is redirected by VPNs), implying web proxies don't redirect all traffic.

    *   **C:** ""athathya pudgalika jaala ha sasandana vita web proksi sewaawe gunathmakabhaawaya aduya"" - This is TRUE according to the passage: ""Eva hetu kihipayak nisa web proxy valata vada hondaya"" (For several reasons, it is better than a web proxy).

**Therefore, only option D presents a statement that is FALSE according to the information provided in the passage.**"
yamekuta owunge jiwath wana pradeshayen pitatha durakathana samaagamak bhaavitha kirimata ida denne kumak da?,"The correct answer is **A: antharjaala prathiyomu aemathum** (Internet forwarding).

The passage states you don't need a local phone company because you can use internet connections to make and receive calls. This is what ""antharjaala prathiyomu aemathum"" (internet forwarding) refers to. It is the ability to make calls using the internet, making your physical location irrelevant to the phone number you use.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: goleeya durakathana anka (Global phone numbers)**: The passage mentions that a separate international number may need to be purchased to receive calls from PSTN phones, but doesn't explicitly state that one must buy it to use a phone company outside of where they live. It only applies when receiving calls from traditional PSTN phones.

*   **C: chand‍rika (Satellite)**: While satellite internet is mentioned as an example, it is just one method used to connect to the internet, it is not the reason to use a phone company outside of one's place of residence. The key is the internet connection itself.

*   **D: PSTN durakathana (PSTN phones)**: The passage mentions PSTN phones as needing international numbers to make calls to numbers outside the country. This is not the correct answer.

Therefore, **A** is the best answer."

This translates to ""Often, to allow calls to you from PSTN phones, a separate international number must be purchased.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: goleeya ankayak miladee gaeneema** (purchasing a global number/international number)

ithali wachana uchchaaranaya kirima pilibandawa niwaeradiwa visthara nokaranne pahatha sandahan karunu walin kawareda?,"The question asks which of the following points **is NOT** an accurate description of Italian pronunciation according to passage P.  Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: dvithwa aar akurehi uchchaaranaya thani aar akurata wadaa wenas we (The pronunciation of a double 'r' is different from a single 'r')** - Passage P *explicitly* states this: ""Emenma r saha rr venas lesa uchcharanaya kirimata wagabalaa ganna: caro yannehi teruma muva wana athara, carro yanu mangala rathaya we."" Therefore, this statement *is* accurate based on the text.

*   **B: boho wachana ewa liyana aakarayenma uchcharanaya karanu labai (Many words are pronounced the way they are written)** - Passage P *explicitly* states this: ""Boho wachana eva liyana aakaarayenma uchcharanaya kireema hetuven itaali bhashaven uchcharanaya sapeksava pahasuya."" Therefore, this statement *is* accurate based on the text.

*   **C: see saha ji yana akuru sahitha wachana aseeru viya haekiya (Words with 'c' and 'g' can be difficult)** - Passage P *explicitly* states this: ""Evaye uchcharanaya ilanga svaraaksharayata anuva venas wana baevin, pravesam viya yuthu pradhaana akuru c saha g wei."" Therefore, this statement *is* accurate based on the text.

*   **D: boho wachanawala uchcharanaya eelanga swara aksharaya anuwa wenas we (The pronunciation of many words changes according to the following vowel)** - Passage P says: ""Evaye uchcharanaya ilanga svaraaksharayata anuva venas wana baevin, pravesam viya yuthu pradhaana akuru c saha g wei."" This explicitly states that the pronunciation of C and G change depending on the vowel that follows. While C and G are the most important and explicitly mentioned, the passage can be interpreted as the vowels changing the pronunciation of a selection of words. Therefore, this statement *is* accurate based on the text.

Since all the statements are correct, there must be a misinterpretation somewhere, or a typo in the original text. Given that options A, B and C explicitly state what is mentioned in the passage, the most likely incorrect statement is option D.

Therefore, the answer is **D**.

*   The passage says that scattered ""sampradhaayika ratu ulu sahitha wahalawal"" (traditional red-tile roofs) are found alongside modern features. This indicates that red-tile roofs are associated with an earlier, more traditional period in Izmir's history.

The other options are elements described as modern or more recent developments:

*   Pulul maavat (wide boulevards)
*   weeduru muhunath sahitha godanaegili (glass-fronted buildings)
*   saappu madyasthaana (shopping centers)
These all point to the ""modern, developed, and busy commercial center"" that Izmir has become."

While the other options are true about Jerusalem, the passage highlights A and D more directly as factors attracting tourists. The passage does not mention that option C (Ehi sanskruthika dae - its cultural things) attract tourists specifically. The passage does mention that Jerusalem is a cultural center, but it is in the context of its religious significance and historical sites that the passage goes on to mention it being a popular tourist destination.

Here's why:

*   The passage states a Wild Card is beneficial for accessing *several* South African National Parks or all the parks.

The passage states that Kruger National Park is a major attraction and a primary unit within the South African National Parks system. It covers a large area (19,500 square kilometers) and is divided into 14 ecological zones.  All of this suggests it is NOT the smallest. The other options are supported by the passage:

*   **B: gal padipela** (stone steps): While the passage mentions stone steps, it doesn't specifically associate them with increased danger.

*   **D: wane kambi aadhaaraka** (wire rope supports): The passage indicates that these supports are there to help people in areas with high elevation, implying they mitigate danger, not increase it."

*   The passage explicitly states that going to the Arctic or Antarctic during the cold/winter months gives you the experience of a ""drive night"" (a night where the sun doesn't rise above the horizon). This means a long period of darkness, which is ideal for stargazing.
*   The passage also mentions that during this period, seeing the aurora borealis is a good opportunity, and this also requires dark conditions.
*   Option B and D are true, but not the *primary* reason the passage gives for when stargazing is best in Antarctica. Option B and D contribute in general, but C is the *specific* event described in the passage.

chand‍rikaa durakathanayak jangama durakathanayak sandaha shak‍ya aadeshakayak nowanne kawadada?,"The correct answer is **A: chand‍rikaawe drushti rekhaawata badhaa aethi wuwahoth (If there is an obstruction to the satellite's line of sight).**

The passage explicitly states that you need a clear line of sight to a satellite in an open area to use satellite internet. If there's an obstruction, you won't be able to connect. The other options, while potentially relevant in certain situations, are not the *primary* reason a satellite phone wouldn't be a good replacement for a mobile phone, according to the given text.
"
chand‍rikaa durakathanayak jangama durakathanayakata wadaa sudusu wanne kawadada?,"The correct answer is **B: bottu sanchaarayak atharathura (during a boat trip)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that satellite phones are often used for navigation, recreational boating, and remote data needs.
*   The passage says that satellite phones are not a substitute for cell phones, and that coverage must be unobstructed
*   Boating trips often take place in areas with limited or no cellular coverage, making satellite phones a necessary alternative.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: nagarayaka niwaaduwak gatha karana atharathura (during a vacation in a city):** Cities typically have strong cellular coverage, making a satellite phone unnecessary.
*   **C: durastha daththa awashya nowana vita (when remote data is not needed):** The passage says satellite phones are often used for remote data, implying they're useful *when* remote data is needed, not when it isn't.
*   **D: obata pramaanawath jangama durakathana aawaranayak laebeemata haeki vita (when you can get adequate mobile phone coverage):** The passage says that cell phones are more common when available. If you have adequate mobile coverage, a satellite phone is not more suitable."
t‍raansnist‍riya janarajaya pihituweemata thudu dun gaetuma pahatha sandahan ewayin kawarak pilibandawa da?,"The correct answer is **B: janavaargikathwaya (ethnic)**.

The passage explicitly states that Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic suffering from ethnic tensions (""janavaargika gaetumen pidaa vinda aethi bahu-vaargika janarajayaki"") and that these tensions led to the formation of the Transnistria republic (""mema gaetuma, naegenahira moldhawe eyatama woo rajayak... traensinistriya janarajaya nirmaanayata hetu viya"").
"
moldowa hi sesu pradeshawalata wadaa wenas namuth t‍raannist‍rya janarajayata ayath wanne pahatha sandahan karunuwalin monawada?  ,"The correct answer is **D: Vyawahara mudal** (currency).

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""...naegenahira moldhawe eyatama woo rajayak saha **vyayavahaara mudalak** sahitha, traensinistriya janarajaya nirmaanayata hetu viya"" which translates to ""...the creation of the Transnistria Republic, with an autonomous government and **currency** in eastern Moldova.""

The other options are not specific characteristics that differentiate Transnistria:

*   **A: Bhaashawa (language):** The passage says both Romanian and Russian are widely used in Moldova.
*   **B: Aagama (religion):** The passage indicates the main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity and doesn't suggest it is different in Transnistria.
*   **C: Eksath jatheenge piligaeneema (United Nations recognition):** The passage clearly states that Transnistria is not recognized by any UN member state. This is a defining feature of Transnistria but not something ""belonging to"" Transnistria that is *different* from other regions of Moldova, since the rest of Moldova *is* recognized. The key is that the question asks what distinguishes it from the *rest* of Moldova."
"mema chedayata anuwa, sulan sahitha thathwayan walakwa gaeneemata balaaporoththu wana sanchaarakayeku montevidiyo hi sanchaaraya kala yuththe kawadada?","Let's break down the information and the question:

*   **The passage states:** Montevideo has summer when the Northern Hemisphere has winter (and vice versa). It also says Montevideo experiences cool temperatures during the winter season, and even though the temperature rarely dips below freezing point, the combination of wind and humidity will make it feel colder than it actually is.
*   **The question asks:** When should a tourist who wants to *avoid windy conditions* travel to Montevideo?

Given this information, the correct answer is:

**C: uthuru ardhagolaye gimhaanaya masawaladee**

**Explanation:**

*   Option C is the only one that is correct as the passage says that when the Northern Hemisphere is in its summer months, Montevideo is in its Winter months. So travelling during those months is not ideal if you don't want to experience cool, windy conditions. The opposite (Montevideo's summer months) is when the Northern Hemisphere is in its winter months.

Therefore, the answer is **C**."
"mema chedayata anuwa, sanchaarakayin sisil deshagunayakata waedi kaemaeththak dakwanne nam, owun montevidiyo wetha ya yuththe kawadada?","The correct answer is **D: uthuru ardha golayehi sheetha irthuwa wana vita**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that when the Northern Hemisphere has winter, Montevideo has summer.
*   The passage states that Montevideo's winter can be relatively cold.

Therefore, to experience the ""sisil deshaguna"" (cooler climate), travelers should visit when the Northern Hemisphere is in winter."
"mema chedayata anuwa, vinaashakaree bhawayata patahaeniwa sthaapitha graefiti kalaakaruweku samaga sambandha wanne pahatha sandahan karunuwalin kawareda?","Based on the paragraph, the correct answer is **A: graefiti kalaa kriyaakaarakam** (graffiti art activist).

The paragraph states that there are ""famous graffiti artists, graffiti activists and 'permanent' walls for it"". This implies a connection between established graffiti artists and graffiti activism.  The other options relate to vandalism or negative perceptions of graffiti.
"
samahara sewakayan athdaekeemwala theeranathmaka angayak lesa salakanne sangeetha uthsawawala kumana angaya da?,"Based on the paragraph P, the answer is **C: raathriya pasuwana thuruma sangeethaya wadanaya kirima (playing music late into the night)**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""pradhaana vedikaave sangitaya nima wee tibuna da, uthsavaye samahara ansavala sangitaya raathrea pasuwee da waadanaya viya haeki bhava mathaka thabaa ganna."" (Even though the music on the main stage is finished, remember that music can be played late into the night in other parts of the festival).

This emphasizes that the late-night music is a key part of the festival experience that many participants consider crucial. None of the other options are directly linked to the *experience* that makes it crucial to them."
"mema chedayata anuwa, uthsawayata sahabhageewanneku sangeethaya prasangayata aasanna sthaanayaka kandawuru baenda gaeneemata awashya nam, owun pramukhathawaya diya yuththe kumak sandahada?","The correct answer is **D: welaasanin paemineema** (Arriving early).

The passage states: ""Sameepayen sandarsanaya naerambimata obata awashya nam, sangitayata aasannava kandavuru baedhime sthaanayak labaa gaeneema sandaha obata velaasanin paeminimata siduvanu aetha.""

Translation: ""If you need to experience the festival closely, you will need to arrive early to obtain a place for camping closer to the music.""

Therefore, arriving early is essential to secure a camping spot close to the music.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, uthuru niw meksikowe raathree kriyaakaarakam soyana aaganthukayan waelakee sitiya yuthu thaen kumakda?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: kaeseeno (casinos)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions that casinos are available in Albuquerque and Santa Fe (the cities mentioned as possible destinations).
*   It also warns about the nightlife in smaller town bars, implying that casinos are a better alternative for visitors.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: pubalos (pueblos)** - While pueblos are interesting historical sites, the passage doesn't suggest they are known for their nightlife.
*   **B: kudaa nagara wala aethi baar (bars in small towns)** - The passage specifically warns against these, stating they may not be safe for outsiders.
*   **C: saappu sankeerna (shopping complexes)** - Shopping complexes are not mentioned in the passage as places for nightlife."
"mema chedayata anuwa, uthuru niw meksikowe prasiddha vinodaswada aethi sthaana soyaa gaeneemata amuththanta boho durata ida aeththe kothaenada?","The passage states: ""mulikava aelbakerke saha santa fey langinma aethi kaesino"" which translates to ""primarily casinos in and around Albuquerque and Santa Fe.""

Therefore, the best answer is **C: saenta fe asala kaesinowaka** (casinos near Santa Fe).
"
ayawaeya gaena saelakilimath sanchaarakayekuta waelakee sitiya yuthu wanne kumana aakaraye panayakda?,"Based on the text provided:

*   The text suggests drinking bottled water is safe if you're concerned about the national water.
*   It mentions national beer as ""number one"" and better than ""Maenta"".
*   It acknowledges fruit juices are expensive but good.
*   It mentions Australian wine is generally a success with varieties from New Zealand and Australia being better options.

Given that a budget-conscious traveler wants a drink, bottled water and national beer are the more affordable options mentioned. However, the text frames the national water as ""completely safe"", which implies bottled water might be an unnecessary expense. National beer is described as the ""number one"", which would make it a preferable budget-friendly choice. Australian wine is considered a ""success"" but would be a more expensive beverage. Fruit juice is more expensive as mentioned at the end of the text.

Therefore, the best answer would be:

**C: desheeya beera** (National beer)
"
"mema chedaye visthara kara aethi pradeshaya matha padanamwa, wetar vyaakoola weemata ida aeththe pahatha sandahan beema aenawum walin kawareda?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: thani sudu kopi.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Oustreliyaanuvanta 'thani sudu' kopi sankalpaya aaganthuka we."" This translates to ""The concept of 'flat white' coffee is foreign to Australians."" This indicates that ordering or understanding the concept of a flat white in Australia might lead to confusion. The other options are either commonly available, a domestic beer, or foreign wine that Australians enjoy.
"

""Spaangna jaathikayan"" translates to ""Spanish people.""

Therefore, the correct answer is D: spaniyads.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, paerisiyanuwan oba wetha lan kara gaeneemata hondama kramaya kumakda?","Based on the passage, the best way to get close to Parisians is **C: aachaarasheeleewa haesirenna (Behave politely/with manners)**.

Here's why:

* The passage says ""Oba mulika achaarasilitva samaharak pennum kalahot paerisiyaanuvaanuvange hadisi baahira svarupayan saenekin aturudan vanu aetha,"" which translates to ""If you show some basic politeness/manners, the immediate outward appearance of the Parisian quickly disappears."" This implies that polite and mannerly behavior helps overcome the initial, perhaps aloof, impression.

kep tawun hi met‍ro dumriya hi palamu panthiye wasiyak wanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: etharam janaakeerna nowe (It is not so crowded)**

Here's why:

*   **P:** ""Metroplas vadaat saepa pahasu, adu janaakirna saha madak mila adhika wana"" - This translates to ""Metroplas is more comfortable, less crowded, and slightly more expensive.""

The passage clearly states that Metroplas (the first class in the Cape Town metro) is less crowded (adu janaakirna).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: maediri dumriye idiripasata wannata aetha (It is at the front of the carriage)** The passage states that closest to Cape Town the metroplas is always at the back of the carriage.
*   **C: eya thewana panthiye prawesha pathrayakata milen adu we (It is cheaper than a third-class ticket)** The passage states that Metroplas is slightly more expensive.
*   **D: eya met‍ro praveshapathaka milata samana we (It is the same price as a metro ticket)** The passage states that Metroplas is more expensive than standard metro fares.

Therefore, the only statement supported by the provided text is that Metroplas is less crowded."
"mema chedayata anuwa, kep tawun hi saema magee dumriyakama aeththe kumakda?","The correct answer is **D: palamu panthiye saha thewana panthiye maediri**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Saema dumriyakama metroplas saha metrow maediri thibe"" which translates to ""Each train has metroplas and metrow carriages.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   A: adu janaakeerna met‍ro maediri (less crowded metro carriages) - While Metroplas is less crowded, the passage doesn't say *every* carriage is less crowded.
*   B: panthi dekatama ekama prawesha pathra mila (same ticket price for both classes) - The passage says Metroplas is ""madak mila adhika wana"" (a bit more expensive).
*   C: wenas panthi thunak (three different classes) - The passage only mentions two classes: Metroplas and Metrow."
sathwa palibodhakayak hata kala nohaeki wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"Based on the provided text (P), the answer is **D: barapathala thuwala sidu kirima (causing severe injury)**.

Here's why:

* **Text P clearly states:** ""Aaasadanaya wana roga, naethinam bhayaanaka sathun balahatkarayen minisun thuwaala kireema how maraa daemeema, palibodha lesa saamanyayen saelakiya nohaekiya.""  This translates to: ""Diseases caused by addiction, or animals forcibly injuring or killing people, cannot generally be considered as consequences/results of animal feed.""

The other options (palukushta aethi kirima, asathmika kaesilla, and aasadanayak paethiraweema) are all mentioned in the first part of text P as being potential consequences of animal feed/supplements.  Only *severe injury or death caused by animals* is explicitly excluded.
"
peragewum durakathana kadapath miladee gatha haekke kothaeninda?,"The correct answer is **A: visheshitha ratawala (Specialized locations/countries)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""samahara eva visheshitha ratawal kaanda wetha laabhadaayi milakata aematum gaeneeme haekiyaawa labaa de,"". This translates to ""Some specialized locations/countries provide the ability to call on profitable prices"". This directly indicates that peregevum durakathana (pre-paid calls) at competitive prices are available in specialized locations/countries."
samahara kadapath magin laba dena wadaa honda aemathum gaasthu wetha prawesha wanne keseda?,"Based on the information provided in paragraph P, the correct answer is **B: gaasthu rahitha anka haraha**.

The text states: ""...mema sevaavalata pivisuma boho vita sidu wanne mudal aya kirimakin torava boho durakathanavalin aematiya haeki gaasthu rahitha durakathana ankayak harahaa we.""

This translates to: ""...access to these services usually happens through a toll-free number through which many calls can be made without charge.""
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, plitwees lek jaathika wanod‍yanaye bahulawa daknata nolaebena gas wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The passage states that Plitvice Lakes National Park is mainly covered with dense forests of beech, spruce, and fir trees. It does not mention oak trees.

Therefore, the answer is **B: ok gasa** (oak tree).
"
plitvis leks jaathika wanod‍yanaye daknata haekiwana durlabha saththwa visheshaya mewayin monawada?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **D: kaeparsayili (kaepakaeilee)**.

The text specifically mentions ""kaepakaeilee aadi durlabha sathun da mehi daekagata haeka"" which translates to ""kaepakeeilee and other rare animals can also be seen here."" The answer is thus the transliteration of the animal name provided in the passage.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, kalaapeeya ketha aeththa washayenma udaw karanne kumak sandaha da?","Based on the provided text (P), the correct answer is **B: weladapola palanaya** (market control).

Here's why:

*   The text states that the true purpose is to give companies better control over their products (""thama weladapalawala vadaat honda paalanayak labaa deema"").
*   It also mentions that it's primarily about earning more money (""thanikarama adhikava mudal ipaeyeema"").

While the text mentions ""neethi virodhee pitapath kirima"" (illegal copying), it explicitly states that the technology *doesn't* actually stop it (""kalaapiya ketha niti virodhi pitapath kireema kerehi kisidu balapaemak aethi nokarayi"").

Therefore, the intended purpose is not about preventing piracy but rather about controlling the market and increasing profits."

The passage explicitly states: ""kalaapiya ketha niti virodhi pitapath kireema kerehi kisidu balapaemak aethi nokarayi"" which translates to ""the area does not have any effect on illegal copying"". This directly contradicts option B, making it the lie.
"
oba obe maw ratata paeminena vita saaman‍yayen avidhimath wanne kumana kriyaawaliyada?,"Let's break down the original statement (P) and the question (Q) to find the best answer.

**Understanding the original statement (P):**

* **""Oba obey mavbimata paeminena vita...""** - When you return to your motherland...
* **""...aagamana pariksaava saamanyayen sidu nokarana ho chaarithraanukula kriyavak vuvada, regu paalanaya karadarakaaree deyak viya haeki ya.""** - ...even if the immigration check is not done normally or is a customary procedure, customs clearance can be a difficult thing.
* **""Obata gena emata haeki saha nohaeki de monavaada yanna oba dannaa bavata sahatika karaganna, emenma nityaanukula simaavata epitin aethi siyalla prakaasha karanna.""** - Make sure you are aware of what you can and cannot bring, and declare everything exceeding the legal limit.

**Understanding the question (Q):**

* **""oba obe maw ratata paeminena vita saaman‍yayen avidhimath wanne kumana kriyaawaliyada?""** - What is the process that usually becomes unregulated when you return to your motherland?

**Analyzing the options:**

* **A: aagamana vigamana pareekshaawa (immigration and emigration check):** The original statement *mentions* this, but *doesn't* say it's usually unregulated.
* **B: bhaanda pilibanda prakaashaya (declaration of goods):**  The original statement *directly* addresses the need to declare items exceeding the legal limit.  This implies that a process of declaration *should* be followed, and deviations from this can lead to issues.
* **C: bhaandawala neethyaanukoola seemawan (legal limits on goods):** These are limits, not a process.
* **D: regu paalanaya (customs clearance):** While the statement mentions customs clearance can be difficult, it doesn't say it's *usually* unregulated.

**Conclusion:**

The statement emphasizes the *importance* of declaring goods above the legal limit. This implicitly highlights that the *process* of declaring goods (B) is often where people deviate from the rules.  Therefore, the most logical answer is **B**.

**Therefore, the correct answer is B: bhaanda pilibanda prakaashaya (declaration of goods).**
"
obe maw ratata paemineemata pera oba daenagatha yuththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"Let's break down the Sinhala text and the question to determine the correct answer.

**Translation of P (The Setup):**

P: Is it ethical or right to not undergo a routine immigration and emigration check upon arrival, as customs clearance could be a complicated process?  Certify that you know what you can and cannot bring, and declare everything that exceeds the legal limits.

**Translation of Q (The Question):**

Q: What of the following should you know BEFORE returning to your home country?

**Analysis of the Options:**

*   **A: aagamana vigamana pareekshaawak thibeda yana bawa (Whether there is an immigration and emigration check)** - This is *very* important.  Knowing if there's an immigration check is fundamental for entering the country legally.

*   **B: neethyaanukoola seemawan ikmawana bhaanda prakaasha kirimata awashyada yana bawa (Whether it is necessary to declare goods exceeding legal limits)** - This is also crucial. You need to know if you're required to declare items that exceed the allowed amounts to avoid penalties.

*   **C: regu paalanayak thibeda yana bawa (Whether there is customs clearance)** - This is essential. Knowing that customs clearance exists is important for understanding the process of bringing goods into the country.

*   **D: oba gena ena kisiyam bhaandayak sandaha awasara nomaethida yana bawa (Whether there are any items you are not allowed to bring)** -  This is also *critical*. Bringing prohibited items can lead to serious consequences.

**Conclusion:**

All the options are important things to know before returning home. However, the core concept that P wants you to focus on is about following the rules when crossing the border and declaring goods. Therefore, the best answer combines concepts from options B and D. Since there is no combination of these, it is more important to know if you need to declare goods.

**Therefore, the best single answer is B: neethyaanukoola seemawan ikmawana bhaanda prakaasha kirimata awashyada yana bawa (Whether it is necessary to declare goods exceeding legal limits).** While A, C and D are also relevant, B addresses the core point of avoiding problems with customs by declaring items.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, kochamo nimnaye kandu naginnan nirantharayen nawa maarga soyaa gaeneemata ida salaswanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **D: biththi (walls)**.

The passage states ""...ehi nimak naethi bitthi athara akhandava nava maarga sthaapitha karamin sitithi,"" which translates to ""...they are continuously establishing new routes among the endless walls."" This clearly indicates that the walls provide the opportunity for continuous route finding for climbers.
"
"mema chedaye dakwa aethi thorathuru matha padanamwa, dakunu ardhagolaye waedima haras maaru aawaranaya karanne kawuda?","The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""staa ellaayans sandhaanaya, laatam van warld sandhaanayata ayat, naegenahira dakunu paesifik santiayago di chili sita tahiti dakva haerennata, an siyalla aawaranaya karayi."" This means Star Alliance (and LATAM within the OneWorld alliance, excluding the Santiago to Tahiti route) covers most of the southern hemisphere.
*   The passage clearly says that SkyTeam doesn't cover any cross-hemisphere routes in the southern hemisphere: ""Kisima guvan sevaa sandhaanayak dakunu ardha golaye saagara haras maaru tunama aawarana nokarayi (thavada SkyTeam kisidu haras maaru kisiyam aawaranaya nokarayi ).""

Therefore, based on the information provided in the passage, Star Alliance covers cross-hemisphere routes in the southern hemisphere (excluding the noted Santiago to Tahiti route)."
dakunu ardhagolaye saagara haras maaru awama washayen aawaranaya karanne kumana guvan sewa sandhaanayada?,"The correct answer is **A: star elaayans**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that ""staar elayans sandhaanaya, latam van warld sandhaanayata ayat, naegenahira dakunu pacific santiayago di chili sita tahiti dakva haerennata, an siyalla aawaranaya karayi"" (Star Alliance, which includes LATAM One World, covers everything except Santiago de Chile to Tahiti in the Eastern South Pacific).
*   The other options are either incorrect or not mentioned as covering trans-oceanic routes in the Southern Hemisphere:
    *   ""Kisima guvan sevaa sandhaanayak dakunu ardha golaye saagara haras maaru tunama aawarana nokarayi (thavada SkyTeam kisidu haras maaru kisiyam aawaranaya nokarayi )."" (No airline alliance fully covers trans-oceanic routes in the Southern Hemisphere (and SkyTeam doesn't cover any)).
    *   There is no ""South Pacific"" airline alliance mentioned.
    *   LATAM One World is included in Star Alliance, therefore not as precise as option A.

Therefore, Star Alliance is the most accurate answer, as it provides the widest coverage of trans-oceanic routes in the Southern Hemisphere compared to the other options."
global raning tuwars sarthaka kara gath sanchaaraka sanvidhaanaya kumakda?,"Based on the text, the successful travel organization that Global Running Tours uses is **B: Go Running Tours**.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, go raning tuwars sthaana duwamin narambana chaarika sanvidhaana karana aayathana keeyak sandaha upakaree weda?","The correct answer is **A: hatharak**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Global raning tuwars hi anupraaptikaya wana go raning tuwars visin, **mahadwipa hataraka sitina sthaana duwamin** narambana saepayumkaruvan raashiyak ekata jaalagata karayi."" This translates to: ""Go Running Tours, part of Global Running Tours, connects a large number of tourists at **two locations in four continents**.""

While the passage mentions ""aayathana 200 kata aasannava aetha"" (close to 200 organizations), it clarifies that many of them operate independently. Go Running Tours specifically operates in **four continents** as clarified above. Therefore the answer is **hatharak** (four).
"
sanchaarakayeku cheetage paehaedili dasunak apekshaa karanne nam kumak kala yuthuda?,"The correct answer is **C: duradaknayak bhaavitha kirima (using binoculars)**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sinhayan, cheetaavan saha diviyan aetaem vita lajjaashili wana athara obata ovun duradaknavalin vadaat hondin daekagata haeki we."" This translates to: ""Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: kandu naegeeme safariyak yaama (going on a mountain climbing safari)** The passage makes no mention of mountain climbing safaris.
*   **B: panduru athara aevideemata yaama (going to wander among the offerings)** This is related to ""jangama safaariyak sandaha"", meaning a walking safari, but the passage doesn't say this is the best way to see cheetahs specifically. It just describes what a walking safari is.
*   **D: motar rathayak gena sammatha upakarana bhaavitha kirima (bringing a motor vehicle and using standard equipment)** While motor vehicles are mentioned for getting close to some animals, the passage specifically states that cheetahs are sometimes shy and best seen with binoculars. So using a vehicle is not the most effective way to view them."
"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, waahanayaka safari vinoda chaarikawaka yedena aaganthukayeku hamuweemata ida aeththe kumana wargaye sathekda?","The passage states that giraffes sometimes approach the motor vehicles, which allows for good photo opportunities. The other animals listed (lions, leopards, cheetahs) are said to be shy and better viewed with binoculars. Therefore, the answer is **B: jiraaf**.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, sanchaaraye viyadama adu karanu aeththe kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: hathara denekugen yuth kandaayamak soya gaeneema** (Finding a group of four people).

The passage suggests trying to form a group of 4-6 people to get a better price for a trip.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, hondama sanchaaraka mila anupathaya laba gatha haekke katada?","Based on the passage, the best tourist price ratio can be obtained by forming a group of 4 to 6 people. Therefore, the closest answer is:

*   **D: pas denekugen yuth kandaayamak (a group of five people)**"
"mema chedayata anuwa, saen fraensisko hi goleeya piligaeneemata hethu wuye kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: vividha kalaa ha maadhya aakarayanhi niranthara niroopanaya** (constant representation in various arts and media).

The passage states: ""Sangitaya, chitrapata, saahithyaya saha Janapriya sanskruthiya thula ehi nirantara nirupanaya, nagaraya saha e thula aethi visheshatha lowa pura prasiddhatvayata pathweemata upakaaree wee aetha."" This translates to: ""Its constant representation in music, cinema, literature, and popular culture helps the city and its special features become world famous.""

This directly supports option A. The other options are mentioned in the passage as contributing to San Francisco's economy or tourist appeal, but not specifically its *global recognition*.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, saen fraensisko pilibandawa sathya nowanne pahatha sandahan prakaashawalin kawareda?","The correct answer is **D: aarthikaya mulumaninma sanchaaraka vyaaparaya matha randaa pawathee (The economy entirely depends on the tourism industry)**.

The passage explicitly states that San Francisco's economy is *diversified*, with professional services, government, finance, trade, and tourism all being significant sectors.  Therefore, it's untrue that it *entirely* depends on tourism.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, sanchaaraka niyojithayekuge sewaawan bhaavitha kirimen prayojana noganne kumana wargaye sanchaarakayekuda?","The correct answer is **B: swayansiddhathawayata goduru wu sanchaarakayeku (A traveler who is independent/self-sufficient).**

Here's why:

*   The passage describes how a travel agent helps with various arrangements like booking hotels, transportation, meals, and even visa arrangements. These are all things a self-sufficient traveler would likely handle themselves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: avinishchitha sanchaarakayeku (An indecisive traveler):** An indecisive traveler could *benefit* from using a travel agent, as the agent could help them narrow down choices and make decisions.
*   **C: thawamath thama visaa labagena naethi sanchaarakayek (A traveler who hasn't obtained their visa yet):** The passage specifically mentions that travel agents can assist with visa arrangements, so this type of traveler *would* benefit.
*   **D: paekeja ganudenu wen karawa gaeneemata kaemathi sanchaarakayek (A traveler who likes to book package deals):** The passage says travel agents commonly provide packages including flights and hotels. Thus, this type of traveler *would* benefit."
sanchaaraka niyojithayeku haraha wen karawa gaeneeme prathilaabhayak lesa chedaye sandahan kara nomaeththe pahatha sandahan karunu walin kawareda?,"The passage doesn't specifically mention ""kadina sanchaaraka lekhanaya"" (difficult travel documentation) as a benefit of booking through a travel agent. It *does* mention the travel agent can help with things like visas (another type of documentation), but the *difficulty* of the documentation is not highlighted as a specific advantage of using a travel agent.

The other options are explicitly mentioned:

*   **B: hotal deemanaa (Hotel Deals):** Mentioned as ""Bohovita sanchaaraka niyojitayinta visheshitha hotel samaga ganudenu paewathuna da..."" meaning Travel Agents often have deals with hotels.
*   **C: siyalla aethulath paekeja (All-inclusive packages):** Mentioned as ""sanchaaraka niyojitayin saamanyayen ude aahaaraya, guvantotupale sita/wethata gamaanagamana pahasukam piliyela karavima ho sanyukta guvan yaana saha hotel paekeja pawa aetulat paekeja labaa dei"" which states they offer all inclusive packages.
*   **D: wen karawa gaeneemak randawa gaeneema (Making and Holding reservations):** Mentioned as ""Obata deemanawa gaana sithimata ho obey gamanaanthaya sandaha wenath lekhana labaa gaenimata (u.da. visaa) kaalaya awashya nam ovunta oba venuwen ven karavaa gaeneema randavaa gatha haeki ya."" which states Travel Agents can reserve or set aside reservations for visas and other things.

Therefore, the answer is **A: kadinam sanchaaraka lekhanaya**.

"mema chedayata anuwa, thathya kaleena pata pariwarthaka yedumakata kala nohaekke monawada?","The passage states that while real-time text translation apps have improved significantly, they are **not always 100% accurate.**

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: videsha bhaasha sanngaa pariwarthanaya (Foreign language signal translation):** The passage implies that these apps *can* translate text seen on objects, implying signals are translatable too, so this isn't something they *cannot* do.

*   **B: sampurna paata kotas pariwarthanaya kirima (Translating complete text segments):** The passage explicitly states these apps can translate entire text segments.

*   **C: smaart jangama durakathanaya haraha wasthun pilibanda pata pariwarthanaya kirima (Translating text on objects via smartphone):** The passage describes the capability to translate text on objects when the phone is pointed at them.

*   **D: 100% k ma niwaeradiwa pariwarthanaya kirima (Translating with 100% accuracy):** The passage directly states that translations are not always accurate, and that users should be cautious as sometimes they are not precise.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: 100% k ma niwaeradiwa pariwarthanaya kirima** because the text states that real-time translation apps cannot guarantee 100% accuracy."
pariwarthana nobaendiwa sidu kirimata ida denne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: bhaasha daththa baagatha kirima** (language data download).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""mema kaandaye vadaatma kaepee penena yedumvalin ekak wanne google parivartanayayi, eya apeksita bhaasha daththa baagata kireemen pasu nobaedi parivaarthaanayata ida dei.""  This translates to: ""One of the most prominent applications in this segment is Google Translate, which allows for uninterrupted translation *after downloading the required language data*.""

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: waedi diyunu kala pariwarthana yanthra** (more advanced translation machines) - While advancements in translation machines are mentioned, the *specific* thing enabling uninterrupted translation is the language data download.
*   **B: smart jangama durakathanaya** (smart mobile phone) - The smartphone is the *platform* for the translation, but not the *reason* it can translate uninterrupted.
*   **D: thathya kaleena pariwarthana kandaye yedum** (real-time translation segment applications) - This is too broad; it refers to the category of applications, not the specific feature enabling uninterrupted translation.

Therefore, only the availability and downloading of required language data makes it possible to translate without interruption."
himakandu kadaa waeteemakata hethuwa nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The passage explains that avalanches (himakadu kadaa vaeteem) can be triggered by several factors:

*   **Hima aelena sulu vimayi:** The text states ""Gaetaluva wanne hima aelena sulu vimayi, enisaa eya pahalata paeminimata yam aarambhayak awashya vena athara..."" which translates to ""The main thing is a slight slope of snow, because it needs a start to descend..."", so a slight snow slope is a factor.
*   **Minisun (humans):** The passage states ""boho durata minis maedihat weemak viya haekiya"" meaning ""most often human intervention is possible"". So, human interference can be a cause.
*   **Hiru eliya (sunlight):** The passage mentions ""saamaahara vita saamaanyayen aarambhaka siduweema wanne hiru magin hima diya kireema"" meaning ""sometimes, the normal starting event is the melting of snow by the sun"".
*   **Athireka himapathanaya (excessive snowfall):** The passage mentions ""samahara vitaka eya waedi vaediyen hima pathanaya weemath..."" meaning ""...sometimes, it is the snowfall increasing rapidly.""

Therefore, all the options are listed as a potential cause within the passage. It is not possible to discern one that definitely *doesn't* cause avalanches.

*However*, if I had to pick the least likely answer from the provided passage, it would be **A: aelena sulu hima**. It's not the ""slope of snow"" in general, but the fact that it *creates* a need for something to trigger the avalanche. It's more of a pre-existing condition. Sunlight, humans, and excessive snowfall are the triggers themselves, according to the text.

Because the question asks what is *not* a reason, and the provided context is lacking, I would likely need more detail to answer this confidently."
"mema chedayata anuwa, himakandu kadaa waeteemak lesa waetenne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: baewum sahitha pallamwala athiriktha hima**.

* **The passage states:** ""Baevum sahitha pallamwalata daraa gatha haekke ithaa mandagami lesa wana athara athirikta parimaavan himakadu kadaa vaetim lesa pahatha vaetenu aetha.""  This directly translates to (roughly) ""Excessive amounts of snow falling slowly from slopes with glaciers can be described as a landslide"". Therefore, the text defines a landslide in this context as extra snow falling from slopes with glaciers.
The other options are incorrect because:

* **A:** The passage says a gradual descent *needs* a beginning.
* **B:** While glaciers are involved, the *lack* of snow doesn't constitute a snow landslide.
* **D:** Human interaction is mentioned as a *possible* factor in *initiating* a snow landslide, but not a requirement for its definition."
"mema chedayata anuwa, vyanjana padanam wee aeththe kumana amud‍ravya wataada?","The correct answer is **B: awshadha paelaeti saha kulubadu**

The passage states that ""Vyanjanayak yanu awushadha paelaeti saha kulubadu musu woo..."" which translates to ""Curry is a mixture of medicinal herbs and spices..."". This directly identifies medicinal herbs and spices as key ingredients. While other ingredients are mentioned, they are regional variations or influence the consistency (thickness or thinness) of the curry, but herbs and spices are the *foundation* of what a curry is, according to this passage.
"
samahara pradesha wala pol kiri samahara vita vyanjana wala kumana amud‍ravyayak wenuwata bhaavitha karanu laebe da?,"The answer is **C: yogat**.

The text says: ""Uthuru indiya saha paakisthana abyantara kalaapavala karivala boho seyin yogat bhaavitha wei; dakunu indiyava saha ardhadvipaye anek verala kalaapavala boho seyin pol kiri bhaavitha wei.""

This translates to: ""In North India and Pakistan, yogurt is mainly used in curries; in South India and other coastal regions of the peninsula, coconut milk is mainly used.""

Therefore, in some regions coconut milk is used in place of yogurt in curries.
"
saanuwata aethul weemata t‍raansaentaktik kandukaraya wata kaerakee yamak awashya wanne aeyi?,"Let's analyze the information provided and the question:

* **P:** Describes a 1600km drive from McMurdo station across the Ross Ice Shelf to the Transantarctic Mountains, involving heavy snow vehicles (tractors) due to glaciers and thick ice. It also mentions the journey around the Transantarctic Mountains to reach a specific location. The passage explicitly states it's not a fast route.

* **Q:** Why is it necessary to circumvent (go around) the Transantarctic Mountains to reach a location (presumably the base of a slope)?

Now let's evaluate the answer options:

*   **A: maekmardo dumriya sthaanaya boho vita wasaa dama aetha (McMurdo railway station is often closed):**  There is no railway station mentioned, and even if there was, this wouldn't explain why they need to go around the mountains.

*   **B: sanyuktha hima anathurudayaka we (The combined ice is dangerous):** While ice conditions might be hazardous in general, this doesn't directly explain the need to go *around* the mountains. Dangerous ice could be everywhere.

*   **C: visheshitha t‍raektar wegawath nowe (Specialized tractors are not fast):**  This explains why the overall journey is slow, but it doesn't answer why they need to circumvent the mountains.  It is related to the pace but not the route.

*   **D: eya ros muhuda haraha gaman kirimata wadaa pahasu we (It is easier than traveling across the Ross Sea):** This option is the most logical. The passage says they're *already* traveling across the Ross Ice Shelf. The reason to circumvent the Transantarctic Mountains is likely because directly crossing them with those vehicles is either impossible or significantly more difficult than going around. This is consistent with the description of driving on ice with tractors.

**Therefore, the best answer is D.** The vehicles are traversing the Ross Sea (on the ice). Circumventing the mountains is preferable because it is easier than attempting a direct crossing.
"
"dakunu dhraewaya haraha, kodi walin salakunu kara aeththe kumakda?","Based on the provided text P:

*   ""Eya aevit kodi valin salakunu kara aethi puravana lada glaesiyara vivara sahitha gana hima wei."" This translates to ""It is thick ice with glacial crevasses filled and marked with flags.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: hima walin pirunu viwarayan (Ice-filled crevasses)**

The text explicitly states that the area is marked with flags *and* filled with glacial crevasses. While the flags might be there for marking, the question asks what is *filled* and marked with flags. So the best fit is the crevasses filled with ice."
dakunudiga aprikaave sanchaaraya kirimedee sanchaarakayin daenuwath viya yuthu deyak lesa chedaye sandahan nowanne meyin kumakda?,"The passage states:

*   ""dakunu aprikaava sthaavarava paewathiyath asalvaesi ratawal siyallama ese novena bhava sihiye thabaa ganna"" - South Africa is stable, but remember that not all neighboring countries are.
*   ""Visa awashyatha saha viyadam ratin ratata venas wana athara"" - Visa requirements and expenses vary from country to country.
*   ""4x4 rathayak yodaagaeneema nuvanata huru we."" - It is wise to use a 4x4 vehicle.

The passage *does not* say that motor travel is a *bad* way to see inaccessible places. In fact, it implies the opposite. It describes motor travel as a way to enjoy the beauty of a region and reach places beyond normal tourist routes.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: motar rathayen sanchaaraya kirima prawesha viya naehaeki sthaana naerabimata honda kramayaki** (Motor travel is a good way to experience inaccessible places.)
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, dakunu aprikaava motar rathayen sanchaaraya kirimata apekshaa karana sanchaarakayinta naraka upadesak lesa saelakiya haekke kumakda?","The best piece of *bad* advice for tourists traveling to South Africa by motorcycle, according to the passage, is **B: 4x4 rathayak nirdesha kalada, boho sthaana walata saaman‍ya waahanayakin prawesha viya haekiya (Even though a 4x4 vehicle is suggested, many places can be accessed by a normal vehicle.)**

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states the opposite.** It says that while a normal car *can* be used with proper planning, *many* places are only accessible by 4x4 vehicles. So, to say you can easily access most places with a regular vehicle is *bad* advice because it's misleading.

Let's look at why the other options aren't the best answer:

*   **A: motar rathaya thula thibiya yuthu samahara hadisi awasthaa ayithama neethyaanukoolawa awashya viya haekiya (Some emergency items to be kept in the motorcycle may be legally required).** This is true based on the passage. The passage mentions that each country has its own regulations about mandatory emergency equipment. It's sound advice to be aware of this.
*   **C: saaman‍ya maarga walin baehaera weemata balaaporoththu wana ayata motar rathayen gaman kirima vishishtayi (Motorcycle travel is special for those who expect to get out of the ordinary routes).** While not stated *directly*, the passage talks about going ""off the beaten path,"" suggesting that motorcycle travel lends itself well to this. This statement is more or less aligns with the general message.
*   **D: dakunu aprikaava awata aethi siyaluma ratawal sanchaaraka katayuthu sandaha sudusu sthaana nowe (Not all countries around South Africa are suitable for tourist activities.)** This is true. The passage says to remember that not all neighboring countries are stable like South Africa. Therefore, D reflects caution that is supported by the passage.

Therefore, **B** is the *worst* advice because it contradicts a key point made in the passage about the necessity of a 4x4 vehicle for accessing many areas."

Here's a breakdown of why each option is or isn't mentioned:

*   **A: ewa sorakamata lak viya haekiya (They can be stolen)** - The passage explicitly mentions that unattended luggage is a target for theft: ""Himikaruvek nomaeti malu sorakamak sandaha ilakkayak wana..."" (Luggage without an owner becomes a target for theft...)

*   **B: oba anudaenumakin thorawa mathd‍ravya gena yanneku bawata pathviya haekiya (You could become an unwitting drug carrier)** - The passage states that someone could put drugs in your bag without your knowledge: ""Obage anudaenumakin thorava obava mathdrawya genayanneku bavata pathweeme haekiyaavak aethi..."" (There is a possibility of you becoming a drug carrier without your consent...)

*   **C: samahara vita eya wenath kenekuge yana vyaakoolathwayata hethu viya haekiya (Sometimes it may cause confusion with someone else's)** - This is **NOT** directly mentioned in the passage. While it's a possible consequence of unattended luggage, the text doesn't discuss baggage mix-ups.

*   **D: baladhaareen ewa viya haeki bomba tharjanayak lesa saelakeemata ida aetha (Authorities may consider it a possible bomb threat)** - The passage mentions that unattended luggage can draw the attention of authorities investigating potential bomb threats: ""bomba tharjana gaena vimasilimat wana baladhaaringe avadhaanayata lakviya haeki ya."" (Luggage can come under the attention of authorities investigating potential bomb threats.)

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: samahara vita eya wenath kenekuge yana vyaakoolathwayata hethu viya haekiya**"

Here's why:

* **A:** The passage explicitly states: ""Samahara ratawala palamuvara vaeradivalata pavaa atisaya darunu danduvam pamunu wana athara, mevaata...maranaya aetulat viya haekiya."" (In some countries, even for a first offense, extremely severe punishments are imposed, including... death).
* **B:** The passage implies this by stating ""Anekun sandaha badu raegena yaama - visesayen oba jaatyantara seemaa tharanaya karana vita kisi vitekat obey gamanmalu penena maanayen aethata noyanna."" (Don't let your luggage out of your sight, especially when crossing international borders). This suggests the need for extra caution.
* **C:** The passage directly mentions: ""Daenumdeemakin thorava onaema welaawaka mathdrawya iva karana sunakhayin bhaavitha kala haeki nisa meyata polime raendi siteemada ayat we."" (Because drug-sniffing dogs can be used without notice, this also includes standing in queues).

Option D is not mentioned in the passage. While the passage warns about the dangers of unknowingly being used to transport drugs, it *doesn't* say that authorities will confiscate luggage even if no drugs are found. The focus is on the consequences of being *caught* with drugs, even unknowingly.

The passage discusses how, while on vacation (either at home or exploring your local area), you have time to enjoy drinks and find new favorites. It mentions making juices or smoothies, finding simple drinks for your routine, and visiting bars or pubs.

The question asks which drink is NOT mentioned as something to try during a vacation at home.

*   **Juice (A):** The passage mentions trying juices.
*   **Coffee (B):** The first sentence talks about finding a new type of coffee.
*   **Beer (C):** The passage mentions visiting bars or pubs, which often serve beer.
*   **Tea (D):** Tea is mentioned in the first sentence.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: beera**. The passage discusses coffee, tea, and juices as options, and beer is an implication based on going to bars/pubs. But of the listed drinks, it is the least directly suggested as something to specifically try."

* **P** directly states: ""Oba jivath wanne vividhaakara paaniya sanskrutiyak aethi nagarayaka nam, oba nithara noyana asalvaesi pradeshawala baar ho pab wetha yanna."" This translates to: ""If you live in a city with a diverse beverage culture, go to bars or pubs in neighborhoods you don't usually go to.""
* **Q** asks where you should go during your vacation if your city is known for its beverage culture.
* **A, B,** and **D** are generic places to buy drinks. The passage suggests exploring new and unfamiliar places, so the correct answer is places you haven't explored before.

*   **B: ehi mulu bhoomi pramaanachayen adak waguru bim walin waesee aetha (Half of its total land area is covered by marshland.)** - The text says that one-third of the 3,850 sq km area is covered by water/marshland. This means it is NOT half of the area. So this is FALSE.

*   **C: eya lowa vishaalathama kadolaana theeruwa we (It is the largest mangrove coast in the world.)** - The first sentence states that Sundarbans is the largest contiguous mangrove forest in the world. So this is TRUE.

*   **D: bengaala kotinta wadaa waedi thith muwan mehi sitee (There are more spotted deer than Bengal tigers here.)** - The text estimates around 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer. So this is TRUE.

Therefore, the statement that is NOT true about Sundarbans is **B**.

**Final Answer: B**

*   **Key Information:**

    *   East-West inter-district buses depart from the bus station between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.  After that, inter-district buses (across the river) leave throughout the day.
    *   Inter-district buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
    *   Small Japanese Coaster buses also serve many districts.
    *   Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable option to places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).

*   **Analyzing the Options:**

    *   **A: sanchaarakaya jakar wetha gaman karana athara daenatamath tikat pathak miladee gena aetha (The traveler is traveling to Jakar and has already bought a ticket.)**

        *   This is a *good* option. Since the passage says inter-district buses often fill up, and it's advisable to buy tickets in advance, already having a ticket is the best situation.

    *   **B: sanchaarakaya bumthang wetha gaman karana athara 7 wana vita pitath viya yuthuya (The traveler is traveling to Bumthang and needs to leave by 7:00.)**

        *   This is also a *good* option. The passage indicates the 6:30 - 7:30 AM buses are the east-west inter-district routes. If they need to leave by 7 AM, they can catch one of these buses.

    *   **C: sanchaarakaya paaro wetha gaman karana athara 11 n pasu pitath viya yuthuya (The traveler is traveling to Paro and needs to leave after 11:00.)**

        *   This is a *weak* option. While inter-district buses run throughout the day, the passage highlights shared taxis as a *quick and comfortable* option to Paro. Since the traveler is leaving later, a shared taxi might be more convenient.

    *   **D: sanchaarakaya naegenahira desata gaman karamin sitina athara 6:20 ta pera bas naewathumata paemine (The traveler is traveling east and arrives at the bus station before 6:20.)**

        *   This is a *weak* option. They are early for the east-west bus, but it is unknown what time their bus would be going and they may or may not have a ticket, which the passage says is needed.

*   **Conclusion:**

    *   Options A and B both represent good courses of action. However, since the passage emphasizes the need to buy tickets in advance (especially for popular destinations like Jakar), **A** is the better option because it shows they are prepared.

Therefore, the answer is **A**."

**Understanding the Text (P):**

*   **Inter-district buses:** Depart between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM but continue throughout the day (across the river).
*   **Bus Seating:** Inter-district buses are often full, so it's advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
*   **Smaller Buses:** Small Japanese ""Koster"" buses serve many districts.
*   **Shared Taxis:** Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to reach places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).

**Understanding the Question (Q):**

*   The question asks for the *best* advice for a traveler planning to travel east from an inter-district bus station.

**Analyzing the Options:**

*   **A: bus ratha pitath wanne 8:30 ta pasuwa pamani (Buses depart after 8:30 only):**  This contradicts the text, which states buses depart between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM and continue throughout the day. So this is incorrect.

*   **B: pera tikat pathak miladee ganna (Buy tickets in advance):** The text *explicitly* states that inter-district buses are often full and that buying tickets in advance is advisable. This is good advice.

*   **C: boho bas ratha dawasa puraawatama pitath we (Many buses depart throughout the day):** While true (according to the text), it's not the *best* advice. Knowing buses run all day is useful, but doesn't address the issue of buses being full.

*   **D: hawul taeksiyakin gaman kirima wadaath buddhimath kramaya viya haekiya (Traveling by shared taxi may be a more intelligent way):** The text mentions shared taxis as a *quick* and *convenient* option to places like Paro and Punakha. However, it doesn't state if Paro and Punakha are the *east* directions and is not a general recommendation for all destinations, therefore not appropriate for this question.

**Conclusion:**

Option B is the most helpful and relevant advice for the traveler, as it directly addresses a potential problem (full buses) and offers a practical solution.

**Therefore, the correct answer is B.**

timbaktu pilibanda niwaeradi vistharayak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: eyata guvan yanayen prawesha viya nohaeka** (It cannot be accessed by air).

The passage states that Timbuktu has an airport (""sanchaaraka aakarshanayak sahitha guvan thotupolakda sahitha nagarayak""). Therefore, it *can* be accessed by air. The other options are all mentioned in the passage:

*   **A:** The passage says Timbuktu has a more Arabic character than other cities in the country (""nagaraya thula aprikaanu svabhaavayata vada araabi svarupayak aethi baevin"").
*   **B:** The passage states that Timbuktu is affected by poverty (""eya dilindubhaavayen pidita nagarayak bavata pathwa aetha"").
*   **D:** The passage says that Timbuktu is a tourist attraction (""Timbaktu, sanchaaraka aakarshanayak sahitha"").

"
timbaktu pilibanda sathya wanne pahatha sandahan karunu walin kumakda?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: nagarayata guvan yanayen prawesha viya haekiya** (The city can be accessed by air).

Here's why:

*   The text mentions ""Timbaktu, sanchaaraka aakarshanayak sahitha guvan thotupolakda sahitha nagarayak vuvat ada eya dilindubhaavayen pidita nagarayak bavata pathwa aetha."" This translates to ""Timbuktu, although a city with a tourist attraction and an airport, has now become a city afflicted by poverty."" This clearly states that Timbuktu has an airport.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   B: meya darid‍rathawata wadaa anija we (This is more destitute than poverty): The text states that it has fallen into a state affected by poverty (""dilindubhaavayen pidita nagarayak bavata pathwa aetha.""), but it does not explicitly say it's *more* destitute than poverty itself.

*   C: awata nagara walata wadaa ehi aprikaanu swabhawaya aduya (Its African nature is less than other cities): The text states ""Nagaraya thula aprikaanu svabhaavayata vada araabi svarupayak aethi baevin, eya rate anek nagaravalata vada sampurnayenma paahe venas svarupayak ganee,"" meaning ""Because the city has more of an Arabic character than an African character, it takes on a completely different character than other cities in the country."" So, it's Arabic nature is dominant, it has less African nature in comparison to its arabic nature.

*   D: nagaraya thawaduratath sanchaarakayin aakarshanaya nokarayi (The city no longer attracts tourists): The text doesn't say it *doesn't* attract tourists anymore, it just implies it is now affected by poverty even though it is a tourist attraction (""sanchaaraka aakarshanayak sahitha guvan thotupolakda sahitha nagarayak vuvat"")."

"mema chedayata anuwa, puneelayak waeni sulangak suli kunaatuvak bawata path wanne kumana awasthaawedee da?","The correct answer is **D: polowa sparsha kirimen pasu** (after touching the ground).

The passage states ""eva polova sparsa woo vitam """"kunaatu"""" bavata path we,"" which translates to ""it becomes a """"tornado"""" after touching the ground.""  The preceding sentence describes the funnel shape (punila aakarayen), so the funnel cloud becoming a tornado is contingent upon it touching the ground. Therefore the answer is D.
"
suli kunaatuvaka niwaeradi lakshanayak wanne mewayin kawareda?,"Let's analyze the provided text and the options to determine the correct answer.

**Translation of the passage (P):**

""A tornado is a rotating column of air that draws air into its interior from the surrounding atmosphere and lifts it upwards, creating a swirling, pressurized atmospheric column.  It causes very high winds (speeds of 100-200 mph), and it can lift heavy objects into the air and transport them as it moves across the ground. It starts as a funnel shape from tornado clouds, and when it touches the ground, it becomes a ""tornado"".""

**Question (Q):**

""Which of the following is a characteristic feature of a tornado?""

**Analyzing the Options:**

*   **A: ewa saema vitama paeyata saethapum 100-200 athara sulangak aethi karayi (It always causes winds between 100-200 mph).** The text states that it *causes* winds *up to* 100-200 mph. ""Always"" is a strong word that may not be correct.

*   **B: ewa boho vita bara wasthun samaga gaman karayi (It often travels with heavy objects).** The text confirms that it can lift and carry heavy objects, making this option plausible.

*   **C: polowa sparsha kirimen pasuwa ewa puneela bawata path we (It becomes a funnel after touching the ground).** The text says it *starts* as a funnel shape *from* tornado clouds and *becomes* a tornado when it touches the ground. So, this is incorrect.

*   **D: ewa wathaya pitathata thallu karana bhramanaya wana theeru we (It is a rotating column that pushes air outwards).** The text explicitly states it *draws* air *into* its interior, so this is the opposite of what a tornado does.

**Conclusion:**

Option B is the most accurate description of a tornado based on the provided text.

**Therefore, the correct answer is B.**"
"ema chedayata anuwa, sanchaarakayeku thama gamanaantha nagaraye deshapalana thathwaya sambandhayen upades laba gatha yuththe kothaeninda?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: owungema rajayen (from their own country)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that advice from your own country, while potentially tailored to its citizens, is still relevant: ""Oba obage rajaya haera anekuth raajyavalin upadeshana labaa gaenimata balaaporothtu viya haeki namuth, ovunge upadeshanaya nirmaanaya wee aeththe ovunge puravaesiyan sandahaa we."" (You can expect to get advice from countries other than your own country, but their advice is made for their citizens).
*   The passage also cautions against relying solely on the destination country's political risk report or the advice of citizens of the destination country because these are generalizations or are not tailored to one's own needs.

"
sanchaaraka upadeshanayak laba gaeneeme dee videsheeya purawaesiyanta athvindiya nohaeki wanu aeththe kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: rate deshapalana thathwaya pilibanda athishaya sarala saraanshayak**

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Anathuru nivedana yanu hudek ek rataka daeshapalana thathvaya pilibanda keti saraasnsayaki...saamaanyaya saha athishaya sarala thorathuru wei."" This directly translates to ""Risk advisories are merely brief summaries of the political situation in a country... and are generally very simple information.""

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: balapaemata lak wu awalangu kirime rakshanaya (Affected cancellation insurance)** - While cancellation insurance can be affected, the passage isn't about that being something *inaccessible* to foreign nationals when receiving travel advice.
*   **C: balapaemata lak wu sawukya rakshanaya (Affected health insurance)** - Similar to A, health insurance could be affected, but it's not the core reason foreign nationals might find travel advice unhelpful.
*   **D: rate deshapalana thaththwaya pilibanda savistharaathmaka thorathuru (Detailed information about the political situation of the country)** - The passage explicitly states the opposite; risk advisories are *not* detailed.

"mema chedayata anuwa, sanchaaraka niyojithayekugen wen karawa gaeneeme sahaya awashya weemata awama idak aeththe kumana aakaraye sanchaarayakata da?","The passage suggests that specialized travel agents are needed for:

*   Unique travel experiences (sobadahama, sanskruthiya, bhaashava, aadaayamlaabhi ratawal pilibanda athdaekim valin obbata vihidena gamanak)
*   Specific travel needs like budgets (ayavaeya paraasayan)
*   Specific destinations (gamanaantha)

It also states that adding a travel agent who is constantly travelling in a similar way to your trip is more beneficial.

Considering the above, the type of trip least likely to require a specialized travel agent would be one where the traveller is already familiar with the location because the agent isn't providing any unique benefits in this scenario.

Therefore, the answer is **A: sanchaarakaya meeta pera sanchaaraya kara aethi nagarayaka waeda samuluwakata wana sanchaarayak** (a trip to a city the traveler has visited before for work or seminars)."
"mema chedayata anuwa, sanchaaraka niyojithayekuge upakarayen sanchaarakayekuta waedima prathilaabha laebenne kumana awasthaawedee da?","Let's analyze the provided text (P) and the question (Q) to determine the correct answer.

*   **P (Text):** The text defines a travel agent (sanchaaraka niyojitha). It mentions that agents can be a good choice for trips considering culture, language, and budget. It also states that while many people like common trips, some prefer specialized travel, budgets, or destinations and then adds that it is better to use an agent who frequently books trips similar to yours.

*   **Q (Question):** The question asks in what situation a traveler benefits from the services of a travel agent.

Now, let's look at the answer options:

*   **A: sanchaarakaya thama upan rata naerabimata yana ena idiri guvan gaman wen karawa gannaa vita** (Traveler books their next trip to their home country) - This scenario doesn't specifically necessitate a travel agent. It could be booked directly.
*   **B: sanchaarakaya palamu warata vishesha chaarikawak wen karawa gaeneemata unanduwak dakwana vita** (Traveler wants to book a special trip for the first time) - This aligns with the text. If a traveler wants something special, a specialist agent can help.
*   **C: sanchaarakaya niwadu gamanaanthaye maw bhaashawen chathura lesa katha kirimata haeki vita** (Traveler can speak fluently in their native language at their vacation destination) - This isn't a benefit of using a travel agent.
*   **D: sanchaarakaya thamanta hurupurudu sanskruthika wenaskam aethi sthaanayakata sanchaaraya karana vita** (Traveler travels to a place with unfamiliar cultural differences) - The text talks about considering culture but doesn't directly say that agent use is automatically beneficial here.

Therefore, the best answer is **B**.

"mema chedayata anuwa, nawa sthaana naerabimata sanchaaraya kirimedee balaaporoththu sunweema walakwa gaeneemata sanchaarakayekuta upakara kala haekke kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: nuhuru aahara athhada baeleemata aethi kaemaeththa (The willingness to try unfamiliar foods)**

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on adapting to differences when traveling.** It highlights that customs, laws, food, traffic, accommodation, standards, language, and other things will be different from your home. It urges travelers to avoid frustration by keeping these differences in mind.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: owun thama rate parisarayata samana pramitheen apekshaa kirima (Expecting standards similar to their home country):** The passage warns against this expectation.
*   **B: nuhuru aahara athhada baeleemata aethi kaemaeththa (The willingness to try unfamiliar foods):** This aligns directly with the passage's advice to acknowledge and adapt to different aspects of the new environment, including food. Being open to trying new foods helps avoid disappointment and negative reactions.
*   **C: owun thama ratata samana neethiwalata anugatha weema (Conforming to laws similar to their home country):** This is impractical and dangerous. You must follow the laws of the place you are visiting, not your own.
*   **D: nawathaen pilibandawa kalin paryeshana kirimen waelakee siteema (Staying aware by researching accommodation beforehand):** While researching accommodation is generally good advice, it is not something that can help avoid frustration or negative feelings while travelling.

"mema chedaye aethi thorathuru matha padanamwa, videsheeya ratakata sanchaaraya karana vita balaaporoththu sunweemak athvindiya haekke kumana aakaraye pudgalayekutada?","Let's analyze the provided text (P) and the question (Q) to determine the correct answer.

**Understanding the Passage (P):**

The passage emphasizes the importance of being aware of differences when traveling abroad. It highlights that the environment is *not* the same as your home country and lists several areas of potential differences:

*   Customs and traditions
*   Laws
*   Food
*   Transportation
*   Accommodation
*   Values
*   Language
*   And other things

The passage concludes by saying that keeping these differences in mind will help avoid frustration or dissatisfaction.

**Understanding the Question (Q):**

The question asks, based on the passage, what *kind* of person is likely to have **fewer disappointments** when traveling to a foreign country. This means we're looking for someone who is *prepared* for the differences described in the passage.

**Analyzing the Answer Choices:**

*   **A: videsheeya aahara walata kaemathi kenek (Someone who likes foreign food):** This is relevant because the passage mentions differences in food. But it's only one aspect of many.
*   **B: wenasweem matha samurddhimath wana kenek (Someone who thrives on change):** This is a **strong** answer. The passage is all about preparing for change and difference. Someone who thrives on change would naturally be more adaptable and less likely to be disappointed by unfamiliar situations.
*   **C: sanwurtha manasak aethi kenek (Someone with a closed mind):** This is the opposite of what the passage suggests. A close-minded person would be more likely to be disappointed because they would be less accepting of differences.
*   **D: igeneemen sathutak labana kenek (Someone who finds happiness in learning):** This is also a good answer because being open to learning new things would help adjust to foreign customs.

**The Best Answer:**

While options A and D have some relevance, the **best** answer is **B: wenasweem matha samurddhimath wana kenek (Someone who thrives on change)**. This is because the passage's central theme is adapting to differences, and someone who thrives on change is inherently well-suited to that. It encompasses all the aspects of change in the other options.

Therefore, the answer is **B**.

Here's why:

*   **A: bima nidaa gaeneemata pera desheeya sathwa sanhathiya pilibanda daena ganna (Learn about the local wildlife before sleeping on the ground)** - This *is* mentioned in the passage: ""Deshiya sattva sanhathiya pilibanda avabodhayak obata nathinam, pradeshawala bima mettayak ho thuni kottayak matha nidhaa noganna."" (If you do not have an understanding of the national animal population, do not sleep on a mat or cloth pillow in the area).

The text (P) advises on how to travel in developing countries (""sanvardhanaya wana rata""). It mentions the importance of not underestimating the potential for cultural shock and suggests some measures to ease the transition:

*   Using high-quality hotels, food, and services of Western style (batahira aakaraye saha gunaatmaka bavin ihala hotal, aahara saha saeva bhaavitha kirimata salakaa balanna).

*   Not sleeping on the bare ground or a thin mat without understanding the local wildlife (deshiya sattva sanhathiya pilibanda avabodhayak obata nathinam, pradeshawala bima mettayak ho thuni kottayak matha nidhaa noganna).
*   Bringing a camp bed or hammock to protect from snakes, centipedes, and other creatures (Oba kandavuru baedhimata yanne nam sarpayan, gonussan saha wenath evaeni sathungen aaraksha weemata kandavuru sayanayak ho ellena aendak gena enna).

The question (Q) asks which of the following is NOT advised to avoid when adapting to developing countries.

Now let's examine the options:

*   **A: batahira aakaraye aahara (Western-style food):** The text suggests **using** Western-style food initially to ease the cultural shock, not avoiding it.
*   **B: gunaathmaka sewaawan (quality services):** The text suggests **using** quality services initially to ease the cultural shock, not avoiding it.
*   **C: kandawuru baendeema sandaha mettayak ho thunee kottayak (Mat or sheet for camping):** The text suggests **avoiding** sleeping directly on a mat or sheet, especially if you don't know the local wildlife. This implies that it is something to avoid.
*   **D: gunaathmaka hotal (quality hotel):** The text suggests **using** quality hotels initially to ease the cultural shock, not avoiding it.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: kandawuru baendeema sandaha mettayak ho thunee kottayak**, as the text advises *against* sleeping on the ground without proper precautions.

**C: owunge laeptop pariganaka mathakaye pitapathak thaba gaeneema (storing a copy in the memory of their laptop)**

Here's why:

*   The text specifically suggests storing a copy on a laptop or tablet's memory for offline access.
*   Options B (emailing themselves a copy) and D (storing it in the cloud) both require internet access, which is stated as potentially unavailable.
*   Option A (giving a copy to travel companions) is helpful but doesn't guarantee the policyholder will have the copy when they need it.

*   The text also specifically mentions that Bowen Island is a popular destination.
*   Granville Island is mentioned as being easily accessible from Vancouver, but not necessarily being a destination that's attractive despite cost.

*   **Obey pradeshaye niti virodhi nowoowath, guvan thotupalak asala ho janakaayakata ihalan dronayak piyaasara karavima sampurnayenma paahe vaeradi adahasaki.** (Even if it is not illegal in your area, flying a drone near an airport or over a population is completely a bad idea.)

The passage emphasizes the importance of checking what you are allowed to record, obtaining necessary permits or licenses, and avoiding flying drones near airports or populated areas. It also states that If you are not allowed to take a photograph of something, you should not even consider recording a video of it. It does not mention anything about needing a research permit.

The other options are mentioned or implied in the passage:

*   **A: obata patigatha kirimata awasara aethi de kalthiya pareekshaa kirima** (Checking what you are allowed to record) - Directly stated.
*   **B: amathara balapathra laba gaeneema** (Obtaining additional licenses) - Directly stated.
*   **D: d‍ronaya pilibandawa saelakilimathad noviya haeki adu janaakeerna pradeshawala pamanak roogatha kirima** (Recording only in sparsely populated areas where drones are not likely to be a concern) - This is implied by the statement about not flying drones over populated areas."
"mema chedayata anuwa, d‍ronayak bhaavithayen roogatha kirimata hondama sthaana koheda?","The correct answer is **D: e sandaha oba pera awasara laba gath pradeshawala** (in areas where you have obtained prior permission for it).

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes the importance of getting permission before recording videos/photos, especially with drones. It highlights checking for the necessary permits and licenses.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   A: The passage implies that you *should* be concerned about disturbing people with a drone.
*   B: The passage says if photography is disallowed, you shouldn't record video either.
*   C: The passage advises against flying drones near airports or populated areas, indicating that staying out of sight in busy places is **not** a valid strategy."
"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, visaa balapathra kriyaawaliya sandaha liyapadinchi weeme awashyathawaya pilibanda sathya nowana prakaashaya kawareda?","The passage says:

*   Registering the place of residence is an **additional requirement** for the visa and passport process.
*   In some countries, you need to register your address with the local authorities.
*   This involves filling out a form with the local police or going to the immigration office.
*   In many countries with such a rule, hotels handle the registration.
*   In other cases, only those staying outside of tourist accommodations need to register.
*   Because the rules vary, it is best to check in advance.

Now let's look at the options:

*   **A: oba sanchaaraka nawathaen wala raendee sitinne nam, obata liyaapadinchi weemata awashya noviya haekiya (If you are staying in tourist accommodations, you may not need to register).** This is TRUE according to the text.
*   **B: siyaluma ratawala pradeshee baladhaareen samaga liyaapadinchi weema awashya we (In all countries, it is necessary to register with local authorities).** This is FALSE. The passage states registration with local authorities is only required in *some* countries.
*   **C: aagamana vigamana kaaryaala wetha yama awashya viya haekiya (It may be necessary to go to the immigration office).** This is TRUE, the passage mentions immigration offices.
*   **D: samahara sthaanawala desheeya hotalwalata liyapadinchi weeme kriyawaliya haesiraviya haekiya (In some places, domestic hotels may handle the registration process).** This is TRUE according to the text.

Therefore, the incorrect statement is B.

*   It's sometimes required to register your address with local authorities.
*   This may involve filling out a form with the local police or visiting the immigration office.
*   In many countries with such laws, hotels handle the registration.
*   Sometimes only those staying outside tourist accommodations need to register.

Based on this:

*   **A: Pradesheeya polis sthaanayak (Local police station):** Mentioned as a place where you might fill out a form for registration.
*   **B: Owun naewathee sitina hotalaya (Hotel where they are staying):** Mentioned as often handling registration.
*   **D: Aagamana vigamana kaaryaalaya (Immigration office):** Mentioned as a place you might need to visit for registration.

**C: Pradesheeya thaepael kaaryaalayak (Local postal office):** Not mentioned at all in the passage as a place to handle tourist registration.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Pradesheeya thaepael kaaryaalayak**.

sanchaaraya karana atharathura swechcha sewayen prayojana noganu aeththe kawuda?,"Let's analyze the provided text (P) and the question (Q) to determine the correct answer.

P states that volunteering abroad is a great way to experience a different culture, meet new people, learn about yourself, gain perspective, and acquire new skills. It also mentions that many volunteer opportunities provide accommodation and sometimes a small stipend, making it a good way to save money while staying in a place for an extended period.

Q asks: ""Who would *not* benefit from volunteering while traveling?""

Now let's evaluate the options:

*   **A: videshagathawa sitina vita nawa mithuran aethi kara gaeneemata balaaporoththu wana kenek (Someone who expects to make new friends while abroad):** According to P, volunteering is a good way to meet new people. So, this person *would* benefit.

*   **B: ihala waetupak soyana kenek (Someone looking for a high salary):** P mentions that some volunteer positions offer a *small* stipend. Someone looking for a high salary would *not* find volunteering abroad to be a suitable option.

*   **C: nawa nipunathawayak laba gaeneemata balaaporoththu wana ayek (Someone who expects to acquire new skills):** P explicitly states that volunteering is a good way to gain new skills. So, this person *would* benefit.

*   **D: kaamaraya ha nawaathaena pilibandawa unanduwak daekviya haeki kenek (Someone who can show interest regarding rooms and accommodation):** P explains that many volunteer positions provide accommodation. So, that person *would* benefit.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: ihala waetupak soyana kenek (Someone looking for a high salary)**.

"mema chedayata anuwa, seemitha ayawaeyak sahitha sanchaarakayin sandaha videshayan hi swechcha sewayata idiripath weemen laebena wasi monawada?","The correct answer is **C: kaamaraya saha naawathaen samahara vita pirinamanu laebe** (Room and board are sometimes provided).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Boho svechchaa raekiyavan obata naewatheemata kaamarayak saha kihipayak obata kudaa vaetupakda labaadena baevin, yam kisi sthaanayaka waedi kaalayak raendi siteema sandaha viyadama sakasuruvam kirimata eya honda kramayak we."" This translates to: ""Many volunteer jobs give you a room for accommodation and some even give you a small allowance, so it is a good way to save expenses to stay longer in a place.""
This means option C is directly supported by the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: waetupak saema vitama pahe laba denu laebe** (Allowances are always given at a low amount) - The passage states ""kihipayak obata kudaa vaetupakda labaadena"" (some even give you a small allowance), indicating not all volunteer jobs give allowances, so ""always"" is incorrect.
*   **B: eya saaman‍yayen raekiya awasthaawan hata manga padayi** (It usually paves the way for job opportunities) - The passage does not mention anything about paving the way for future job opportunities. It focuses on cultural exchange, self-discovery, and gaining perspectives and skills.
*   **D: eya obata idiri darshanayak laba gaeneemata upakaree we** (It helps you gain a future perspective) - While true, it doesn't directly relate to the cost-saving aspect for travelers on a limited budget. The question asks about the benefits *specifically* for those with limited budgets.

"mema chedayata anuwa, wolt disni warld wetha yana saaman‍ya gamane advitheeya yaeyi saelakiya haekke kumak da?","Based on the passage, the most unique aspect of a typical Walt Disney World trip is:

**C: disni parish‍raya thula mulu gamanama viyadam kirima (Spending the entire trip within the Disney premises)**

Here's why:

*   The passage describes a typical trip as including flying into Orlando International Airport, staying at a Disney hotel, and spending about a week within the Disney World area. This implies a self-contained vacation experience within the Disney resort.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: ud‍yaana gaweshanaya karamin sathiyak gatha kirima (Spending a week exploring the park):** While spending a week is mentioned, it's not necessarily unique, as people might spend shorter or longer times exploring.
*   **B: sthaaneeya nowana hotalayaka nawathaen gaeneema (Staying at a hotel that is not local):** This is too broad. Many people stay at hotels that are not local when travelling, regardless of destination.
*   **D: guvanthotupale sita hotalayata bas rathayak laba gaeneema (Getting a bus from the airport to the hotel):** While Disney offers transportation, it's not necessarily unique to the Disney World experience. Other resorts and hotels offer similar services."

The passage explicitly states: ""...disni visin thahanam kara aetha: enam pravesha pathra maaru kala nohaeki ya"" which translates to ""...Disney has forbidden it: that is, tickets cannot be exchanged.""

Therefore, option A contradicts the provided information. The other options are supported or at least not contradicted by the text.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Wanaanthara thula paewaethma sambandhava aethi poth saha sangaraa sulabha namuth yuda kalaapa sambandhayen kerena prakaashana svalpa ya."" This translates to: ""Books and leaflets regarding survival in the wilderness are readily available, but publications related to war zones are few.""
*   This implies that information and training about war zone preparedness are less common and therefore less likely to be covered in professional training or publications compared to wilderness survival, first aid, or role-playing exercises."
"mema chedayata anuwa, wurththeeya puhunu panthiyaka aawaranaya kirimata boho durata ida aeththe pahatha sandahan vishayayangen kawareda?","The passage states: ""Paataamaalaavak saamaanyayen dina 2-5 k pawathina athara, bhumikaa ranganaya, **bohomayak prathamaadhaara** saha aetaem vita aayudha puhunuva aetulat vanu aetha.""

This directly translates to: ""The course generally lasts 2-5 days, and includes role-playing, **extensive first aid** and in some cases weapons training.""

Therefore, the answer is A: prathamaadhaara (first aid).

"mema chedayata anuwa, jalaya apavithra weemen walakwa gaeneema sandaha wana hondama vikalpaya kumakda?","The passage discusses water filters and different ways to treat water.

Let's break down the options:

*   **A: miniththu kihipayak sandaha jalaya unu karanna (Boil water for several minutes):** The passage mentions different water purification methods and duration of boiling water.

*   **B: bothal kala jalaya miladee ganna (Buy bottled water):** The passage explicitly recommends buying sealed, branded bottled water from reputable companies if you're concerned about safety.

*   **C: ek miniththuwak sandaha jalaya unu karanna (Boil water for one minute):** The passage mentions that it is not adequate in all cases.

*   **D: nishchitha tharjana pilibandawa jalaya aegayeemata lak karanna (Subject water to specific threats):** This doesn't make sense in the context of purifying water.

Based on the passage, the best option to ensure water is safe is **B: bothal kala jalaya miladee ganna (Buy bottled water).**"
"mema chedayata anuwa, daksha pihinumkaruwanta pawaa kala nohaeki viya haekke kumak da?","The text clearly states that many deaths occur due to trying to swim against the rip current, which is a very difficult task. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: diyaraeliwalata erehiwa pihineema (swimming against the rip current)**
"

Here's why:

* **P states:** *""Rip diyaraeli yanu boho vita galparayaka ho eeta samaana deyaka vaedee, veralaka bidena rala valin naewatha galaa yana raellayi.""* - Rip currents are often currents that flow back from the shore, breaking waves.
* **P also states:** *""Boho marana siduvanne, itha apahasu karayayak wana, diyaraelivalata erehiva pihinimata uthsaaha kireemen aetivana tehettuva hetuveni.""* - Many deaths occur due to the fatigue of trying to swim against the rip current.
* **And also states:** *""Naewatha hasu novena thenakata yaamata ilakka karanna, naethinam obage kusalata anuva saha obava daeka aethda yanna anuva, galavaa gaenimata ena turu raendi siteemata obata siduviya haekiya.""* - Aim to get to a place where you will not be trapped again, or depending on your skill and whether you are visible, you may have to wait to be rescued.

This strongly advises **against** swimming directly against the current. Instead, it suggests moving *out of* the current before swimming back to shore.

Therefore, A is the only answer choice that aligns with the advice in the text.

It also mentions taking a river cruise along the Danube and boating along the Erie Canal.

The question asks where visiting a fortress would be a worthwhile vacation activity based on the passage.

*   **A: daenub dige nagarayak (A city along the Danube):** While the Danube is mentioned, it's about taking a cruise, not specifically visiting fortresses.
*   **B: eeri aela asala (Around the Erie Canal):** The Erie Canal is mentioned for boating, not fortresses.
*   **C: rayin nimnaye (The Rhine Valley):** The Rhine Valley is specifically mentioned as a place where you can visit fortresses.
*   **D: onaema miridiya jala maargayak asala (Near any watery waterway):** This is too broad. The passage gives specific examples.

Therefore, the best answer is **C: rayin nimnaye (The Rhine Valley)**.

*   **C: deepthimath aabharana paelandeemen walakinna (Avoid wearing flashy jewelry)**

**Reasoning:**

The text explicitly states:

*   The text says nothing about jewelry.
*   The text says nothing about rejecting men directly or standing your ground.

**Other Options and Why They *Are* Considered Good Advice (according to the text):**

*   **A: viwahaka aviwahaka thaththwaya saakachcha kirimen walakinna (Avoid discussing marital status):** The text directly mentions that regardless of marital status (married or unmarried), the traveler should present as if they are married.
*   **B: sanskruthika wenaskam desheeya janathawage daedi haesireemata hethu viya haeki bawa karunawen salakanna (Carefully consider that cultural differences could lead to strong reactions from the local population):** The text highlights that cultural differences can be a reason for unwanted attention, though things like unwanted touching are not rare.
*   **D: awashya wita daedi bawa penwanna (Show strength when needed):** The text states that you shouldn't be afraid to stand your ground and stand firm when rejected by men. Even if culturally different, this is acceptable.

**Therefore, the only option that is NOT supported by the text as a suitable suggestion to be followed by a female traveler is avoiding flashy jewelry.**

"mema chedaye visthara kara aethi pradeshaya matha padanamwa, kaantha sanchaarakayin sandaha prayojanawath ingiyak wanu aeththe kumak da?","Let's break down the original paragraph (P) and the question (Q) to arrive at the best answer.

**Understanding Paragraph P (translated roughly):**

*   **Location:** It speaks of a journey from a northern Sahel region, down south, and towards the Atlantic Ocean near Basnahira (Likely referring to parts of Africa). The journey involves water, which may be referring to the travel down the coast of Africa..
*   **Advice:** The central point is *directed at women travelers*. It explicitly says regardless of marital status, if someone is on a romantic journey, it's viewed as ""married."" Then, it warns against wearing a large ring. The paragraph states that **wearing a big ring to symbolize marriage would be counterproductive** and cause problems. It suggests that cultural differences might be the reason and that while public displays of affection and walking arm in arm are rare, this is normal.  Then, finally, it gives advice about standing firm on the face of rejection and not being afraid to stand your ground (regardless of cultural differences).

**Understanding Question Q:**

*   ""Considering the area described, what is a useful tip for women travelers?"" In other words, what specific piece of advice can a woman traveler extract from the text, to make the journey a little easier?

**Analyzing the Answer Choices:**

*   **A: luhubaendeema saaman‍ya deyak nowana bawa handunaa gaeneema (Recognizing that intimacy is not something common)** - This doesn't directly address the warning about the large ring. It's a general observation about cultural norms of intimacy, but not the core advice about avoiding a large ring.

*   **B: viwahaka bawa sankethawath kirima sandaha vishaala muddak palandinna (Wearing a large ring to symbolize marriage)** - This is the **opposite** of what the paragraph advises. The paragraph *warns against* wearing a large ring to signal marriage.

*   **C: sanskruthika wenaskam awabodha kara gaeneema yanu obe sthaawaraye siteemen waelakee sitiya yuthu bawayi (Understanding cultural differences and standing your ground)** - This addresses the general cultural differences referenced, and the general advice about being firm in your position. However, it's a secondary point, and doesn't address the core message about the wedding ring.

*   **D: anawashya luhubaendeemak aethi awasthaawaka, oba purushayin sthira lesa prathikshepa karanna (In unnecessary intimate situations, firmly reject the men.)** This is an advice to stand your ground when faced with unwanted sexual advances. This is indeed mentioned in the text, however, it is a secondary point, and doesn't address the core message about the wedding ring.

**Conclusion:**

Option **B** is wrong because it's the opposite of what is advised. Options C and D are good advice, but does not address the main advice of the excerpt.

The key advice is avoid wearing a large wedding ring, so none of the options fully reflect it. However, **option B (Wearing a large ring to symbolize marriage)** is the closest. It is the opposite of the main point of the text, and as such, understanding why is the most important piece of advice. The correct answer is therefore **B**.

Here's why:

* The passage states ""Vanajivi jaayaarupakaranaya sandaha boho vita digu telepoto kaachayak awashya wei, namuth kurulu ranhcu ho ithaa kudaa sathun sandaha anekuth kaacha awashya we."" This translates to ""A long telephoto lens is often needed for wildlife photography, but other lenses are needed for bird flocks or very small animals.""  Therefore, when photographing small animals, a special lens *other than* a telephoto lens would be required.

Let's examine why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: chayaroopa waanijamaya aramunu sandaha bhaavitha karanne nam:** This is incorrect because the passage states there are specific regulations or guidelines for wildlife photography for commercial purposes, which does not state any specific type of lens used.
*   **C: chayaroopa gatha karanu labana sathun laejjasheelee nam:** The passage mentions that wildlife can be shy, but this doesn't automatically dictate the *specific* type of special lens a photographer might need.
*   **D: wanod‍yaanayakata wanajiwee chayaroopakaranaya sambandhayen vishesha neethireethi thibe nam:** The passage mentions that parks have rules, but this also does not specifically dictate the type of lens used.

*   Wildlife can be shy or aggressive (Wana jivin laejjaashili ho aakramanasili weemata ida aetha.) - **Option B**
*   Dangerous environments (parisaraya seethala, unusum ho wenath aakarayakin ahithakara ekak weemata ida aetha.) - **Option D**

The passage does not say that **obtaining** necessary lens types (Option C) is a challenge. It mentions *needing* specific lenses, but not difficulty in getting them.

Therefore, the answer is **C: awashya kaacha wargaya laba gaeneema**

*   The passage clearly states that ice and snow reduce friction on roads, making it harder to drive.
*   It also mentions that snowstorms, falling snow, and ice forming on vehicle windows can limit visibility."

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: anupaatha (rates)**: The passage explicitly states that tax rates vary significantly from country to country. So this is incorrect.
*   **B: vyuhaya (structure)**: The passage says that the structure of income tax is different for each country. So this is incorrect.
*   **C: oba gonu karana thaena (the place you file)**: It is not always constant because in some federal countries, taxes are filed both at a federal and a state/provincial level.
*   **D: warahan (brackets)**: The passage mentions that tax brackets (the income ranges to which different tax rates apply) differ significantly from country to country. So this is incorrect.

However, the prompt mentions: **oba raajya taantrikayeku novanne nam, videshayaka sevaya kireema yannen, oba sitina rate aadayam badhu gonuvak pawathwaagaeneemata awashya wana bhava saamaanyayen adahas wei.** which translates to **if you are not a state official, serving in a foreign country, it generally means you need to maintain an income tax file in the country you are in.**

The most accurate answer from the given options, based on the passage and the added context, is **C: oba gonu karana thaena (the place you file)** even though it isn't entirely constant everywhere, the need to maintain an income tax file in the country you are in is a basic requirement.

**Therefore, the answer is C.**"

*   **B: udbhida vid‍yathmaka pradarshana kalaathmaka ha adhyaapanika pradarshana samaga pradarshanaya kere** (Botanical exhibitions are exhibited along with artistic and educational exhibitions): The text states that international horticultural exhibitions are separate, specialized events focusing on flowers, botanical gardens, and plants. Therefore, they are not exhibited together.

*   **C: mema vishesha siduweema masa hayak dakwa paewathiya haekiya** (This special event can last up to six months): The text mentions that these events typically last between three and six months.

*   **D: ratawal sahabhagee weema awashya naetha** (Participation of countries is not necessary): The passage clearly states that the exhibitions are international festivals where participating countries present displays, so participation of countries is necessary.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: rataka ithihasaya saha loka prashna yana dekama pradarshanaya kala yuthuya (both the country's history and world problems should be displayed)** - The passage mentions countries displaying their culture and history, but not explicitly world problems.
*   **B: ekama ratak warshikawa vishesha siduweem sandaha sathkarakathwaya laba deemata nohaeka (the same country cannot be the host for special events annually)** - The passage doesn't mention any restriction on the host country. It only says it can happen theoretically but not practically.
*   **D: paewaethweemata niyamitha pradarshanaya sandaha siyalu ratawal sahabhagee viya yuthuya (all countries should participate in the planned exhibition)** - The passage doesn't state that participation is mandatory."

*   The passage explains that despite seeming docile, animals like bison, moose, bears, etc. can attack if approached too closely. The passage focuses on the unpredictable nature of these wild animals and the need to give them space. Option D directly reflects this idea. The fact that animals are ""unfamiliar to humans"" is **not** mentioned as a cause for animal attacks.

Let's eliminate the other options:

*   **A: thada gandhaya (strong odors):** The passage explicitly mentions that strong odors attract bears and other wildlife, potentially leading to dangerous encounters.
*   **B: durasthabhawaya pawathwa gaeneemata asamath weema (failure to maintain distance):** The passage clearly states that many tourists are injured each year due to not keeping a safe distance.
*   **C: wanajiweenta aahara laba deema (feeding wildlife):** The passage directly warns against feeding wildlife, as it can alter their behavior and lead to dangerous encounters.

Therefore, **D** is the only option not explicitly mentioned in the passage as a potential cause of animal attacks."
