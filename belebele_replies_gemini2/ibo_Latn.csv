"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, kedụ ihe agaghị anabata ka okwu ọma kpọmkwem banyere ịgwu egwu akọdịọnụ?","The correct answer is **D: Wegote ike iji apị beelo ịji nwetakwu nnukwu olu egwu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that, unlike a piano, you *don't* need to use excessive force on the keys (or bellows in the case of an accordion) to get a louder sound.  Instead, you achieve volume by controlling the bellows with greater air volume. Option D directly contradicts this advice. The other options offer suggestions for playing the instrument more efficiently and accurately, just as the passage recommends.
"
"Ka iji akọdịọnụ egwu egwu, kedụ n’ihe ndị a ga-enye aka inwelite olu egwu?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Tinyekwuo ọsọ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...iji nwetakwuo ụhàraụdà, ị ga-eji ọfụ ikuku ndị ahụ n'ijikwu ọkwụkwa ma ọ bụ ekwomọsọ."" This refers to using the bellows more effectively.  Using the bellows more effectively, which means increasing the speed at which you move the bellows, will increase the volume of the accordion.

Let's eliminate the other options:

* **B: Tinyekwuo ike:** The passage explicitly warns against using too much force in the fingers and hand.  While some force is needed, the key is efficiency, not brute strength.
* **C: Welata nkwakanye:** The passage doesn't suggest reducing packing and is unlikely to relate directly to increasing the volume of music.
* **D: Welata nkwagharị mkpịsị aka:** The passage encourages minimizing unnecessary finger movements to conserve energy, not to control volume directly.

Kedụ ihe kpatara eji egbupu akụkụ ihenlere dị n’igwe onyonyo egbupu?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka ihenlere juputa n’ihu igwe onyonyo niile.**

The passage explicitly states that televisions are made to appeal to the general public, and to achieve this, the picture is cropped (overscanned) so that the image fills the entire screen.
"
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee mmekpahụ mmadụ nwere ike ihu n’ịtụgharị ihenlere n’ụdị DVD?","The correct answer is **B: Gbupụlata nwa isiokwu** (Cutting off subtitles).

The passage explains that overscan is a common problem when converting movies to DVD format. Because TVs are designed to show content that fills the entire screen, the edges of the image are often cropped (overscan). This means that if a movie has subtitles near the bottom of the screen, they might be cut off when played on a TV due to overscan.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Ihenlere na-ejughị ihu igwe onyonyo niile** (Movies not filling the entire TV screen) - This is the opposite of the problem caused by overscan.
*   **C: Ihenlere na-asabasi ihe igwe onyonyo** (Movies widening the TV screen) - This refers to aspect ratio distortion, not overscan.
*   **D: Gbupu akụkụ ihenlere gasị** (Cutting parts of movies completely) - Overscan cuts off the edges of the image, not random parts of it."
Olee ebe e nwere garịsọn Britain?,"The correct answer is **B: Trenton**.

The passage states that General John Cadwalader would attack the British garrison in Bordentown and that the main attack force would cross the river nine miles north of Trenton. The passage also notes that General James Ewing would take 700 men across the river at Trenton Ferry. Therefore, the British garrison was located at Trenton."
Onye ka egosri mbinyeaka ya n'ime dụraftụ ejiri aka dee?,"The correct answer is **D: Chals Tọmsin**.

The passage states: ""Mgbe Kọngres nyechara ya nkwekọrịta ha na Julaị 4, e weere ya n'akwụkwọ eji aka dee, nke Jọn Hankọk Onye isi Kọngres na Chals Tọmsin Onye odeakwụkwọ tinyere akara nkwado ha..."" This clearly indicates that Charles Thomson signed the handwritten draft.
"
"Na obodo ndị a, kedụ ebe Dunlapụ bịara ikpeazụ?","The correct answer is **C: London**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Otu kọpị ruru Lọndọn n'Ọgọstụ 10"" (A copy reached London on August 10th). All the other locations are mentioned with dates *before* August 10th.
"
Kedụ ebe ndị agha Kọlọnelu Stark dị?,"The correct answer is **A: Na mpaghara ngwụsị ugwu, n’ụzọ fensi**

The passage states ""Ndị nwoke Stark guzoro n'akụkụ nsu n'akụkụ ebe ugwu nke ọkwa Colonist."" ""N'akụkụ ebe ugwu nke ọkwa Colonist"" translates to ""north side of the Colonist position,"" and ""n'akụkụ nsu"" translates to ""along the fence,"" hence ""Na mpaghara ngwụsị ugwu, n’ụzọ fensi"".
"
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, kedụ oge ụmụ nwoke Starkị jiri gbatịa fensi ha?","The correct answer is **C: N'oge mbelata taịdị**.

The passage states: ""Mgbe ebili mmiri dị ala mepere oghere n'agịga mmiri Mistik n'agịga ugwu ọwụwa anyanwu nke ala mmiri gbara ogige, ha mere ngwangwa ịgbatị mgbidi ahụ ruo n'ugwu kwụsị n'ọnụ mmiri."" This directly says that they extended the fence when the low tide opened a gap.
"
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee n’okwu ndị a bukarịrị oge ọchịchị mkpagbu nke China?","The correct answer is **D: Oge Ọchịchị Alaeze Atọ**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Oge ndị a nke a kacha mara amara bụ oge nke Alaeze Atọ nke mere ruo afọ iri na isii n'etiti Usoro Ndị Eze Han na Usoro Ndị Eze Jin ndị ahụ."" This directly identifies the Three Kingdoms period as a time of division and conflict in Chinese history.
"
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, gịnị bụ eziokwu nke kọlọni antị ndị agha banyere ịbanye usoro nọmadiki?","The correct answer is **B: Ha nwere ntakịrị ụzọ ha si enweta nri**.

Here's why:

* **P says:** ""...otu anụmanụ ahụ na-amalite usoro nwagharị mgbe nri dị adị gbadatara."" This directly states that a decline in available food triggers the nomadic phase.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ha rụrụ ebe obibi n’abalị:** P states the opposite, they move at night.
* **C: Ha na-arụ ebe obibi ha na-agbanwe ma ọgafechaa mkpụrụ ụbọchị 17:** P states they move *every* day and these phases last 17 days.
* **D: Ha na-eme njem n’oge ehihie:** P states they move during the night.

Olee n'ime ihe ndị a ga-adịgịde n'agbanyeghị ọbịbịa nke ndị nhazi otu ọzọ?,"The passage states that the internal clock has a self-sustaining oscillatory system that continues even without external cues. This describes the biological clock and its inherent rhythm.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: Elekere bayolọjikul (Biological clock)**
"
Kedu okwu bụ nkọwa ndị mmadụ egosipụtara ọdịịche nke otu omume nzipụta?,"The correct answer is **D: Nzịpụta nwere ọtụtụ ụdị**.

The passage states: ""Mgbe ndị mmadụ na-egosi ọtụtụ ụdị nke otu agwa kpọmkwem ha bụ polimọfik."" (When individuals show multiple forms of a particular trait they are polymorphic).
"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a bụ okwu ziri ezi maka ihe ndị dị ndụ nọ n’otu mpaghara?,"Based on the provided text (P), the correct answer is:

*   **B: Ngụpụta ndị mmadụ**

Here's why:

*   The text defines ""pọpụleshọn"" (population) as a collection of organisms of the same species in a specified area.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   A: ""Nzịpụta nwere otu ụdị"" describes a monomorphic population, but the question is about the general term for organisms in an area.
*   C: ""Ụdị ihe gasị"" has no meaning related to the context
*   D: ""Nzịpụta nwere ọtụtụ ụdị"" describes a polymorphic population, but the question is about the general term for organisms in an area."
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a abụghị ihe ọmụmatụ nke ọrụ njem nlegharị anya dabere?,"The passage defines nature-based tourism as tourism that is based on nature, engages people who are interested in experiencing natural places, and includes activities like hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and ecological study.

Given this definition, let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Ịnọgide na mmirimwụda (Staying at a waterfall):** This clearly fits the definition of nature-based tourism.
*   **B: Ịse foto ifuru ọhịa (Photographing wildflowers):** This also fits the definition.
*   **C: Ịga ebe ngosi iheochie nke sayensị (Visiting a science museum):** This is *not* related to experiencing nature. It is cultural tourism related to science.
*   **D: Ife igbu azụ (Fishing):** This fits the definition.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Ịga ebe ngosi iheochie nke sayensị**."
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, kedu n'ime ihe ndị a bụ ihembido nke usoro ịga njem?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Ụgbọ ala nkeonwe (Ụgbọ ala nkeonwe)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes a system ""dabere na ụgbọala nkeonwe"" which highlights the reliance on personal vehicles.
*   The passage describes that everyone in their own way is influenced and supported by the personal car transportation system."
Ụmụ irighiri ihe ndị na-agba nukulus gburugburu kedu ụdị chaaji onwere?,"The correct answer is **C: Chaaji negetivi**.

The passage states: ""Elektrọn gasị nwere chaajị eletriki dị ọjọ."" (Electrons have a negative electrical charge).
"
Kedụ irighịrị ihe mebere nukulus?,"The correct answer is **A: Purotọnụ na nuturọnụ**.

The passage states: ""Neuklọs ahụ bụ ahụ ihe abụọ mejupụtara ya - neutrọn na protọn."" This directly confirms that the nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons.

Kedu n'ime ndepụta ndị a ka ana-ekwughị n'akụkụ akwụkwọ a dị ka isi uru nke ịdere ụmụ akwụkwọ blọgụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Mwebelata nkatọ si n'aka ndị ọgbọ** (Reduced criticism from peers).

Here's why:

*   **A: Nkwalịte ụtọ asụsụ na ike odide** (Improvement of grammar and writing skills) - The passage explicitly mentions that students initially use poor grammar and spelling but improve their writing to avoid criticism.
*   **C: Mmata gbasara gburugburu ebe obibi** (Awareness of the surrounding environment) - The passage states that blogging ""pushes students to be more knowledgeable about the world around them.""
*   **D: Mmụba ọchịchọ maka ọganihụ mmụta** (Increased desire for academic advancement) - The passage mentions that blogging encourages students to extend their learning beyond the classroom.

The passage focuses on avoiding criticism in general, not specifically reduced criticism from peers. The drive to improve comes from the general audience."
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-imeputa blọgụ ka akpọtụrụ ịji kpalite mmụọ ụmụ akwụkwọ iji kwalite nkà ide ihe ha?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: Mmasị nke izere nkọcha**.

While the other options are mentioned in the text as benefits of blogging, the passage directly links the desire to avoid criticism to the motivation for students to improve their writing skills."

Here's why:

*   **The passage states that asynchronous discussions allow students to ask questions at any time and expect faster responses than waiting for face-to-face interaction.** This implies that face-to-face interaction at any time of day is NOT a benefit of asynchronous discussion; rather, it's something asynchronous discussion aims to improve upon.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Ị were ịntanetị ka ọbụrụ ụzọenyemeakaọrụ:** The passage explicitly mentions using the internet to provide constant access to information for learners, making this a benefit of the online approach.
*   **C: Awa ịrụ ọrụ dị nwegharị:** The passage mentions that time constraints are fewer, and the pace of work can be altered, making this a benefit.
*   **D: Usoro njikwa:** The passage refers to asynchronous discussion promoting thoughtful consideration and response to others, which requires self-regulation and directed effort to keep on track."
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee na ndeputa anaghị abịa otu mgbe na adịghị ụmụ akwụkwọ mwegharị?","The correct answer is **C: Ihemmụta Ntụzịaka** (Instructional Design).

Here's why:

*   **The passage discusses the benefits of asynchronous online discussion.** It highlights how it promotes thoughtful responses, flexibility for students, and constant access to information.

*   **Instructional Design** is the field concerned with creating effective and engaging learning experiences. The passage is directly related to how to design instruction using online discussion forums.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Usoro ịmụta akwụkwọ (Learning styles):** While flexibility is mentioned, the passage doesn't primarily focus on catering to different learning styles.
*   **B: Awa ịrụ ọrụ (Working hours):** The passage touches upon the flexibility in time, but it is not the primary subject.
*   **D: Nrụọrụ ịntanetị (Internet function):** While the internet is the medium, the passage is about the pedagogical approach (instructional design) enabled by the internet."
Kedu ihe ndị ana-emetụghị aka na mpaghara akwụkwọ a dịka ihe mmadụ ihe mmadụ nwere ike jikọta ya na kastụlụ midivalụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Olulu dọnjịọn**.

Here's why:

*   **Question Breakdown:** The question asks which of the given terms is least directly tied to factual historical documentation about medieval castles, and most closely associated with the popular or mythical perception of castles.

*   **Answer Explanation:**
    *   **A: Olulu dọnjịọn (Dungeons):** Dungeons are often romanticized and depicted as dark, torturous chambers in popular culture. While dungeons existed in castles, their actual use and conditions are often exaggerated in fiction compared to historical records. This makes it the strongest candidate of these listed options.
    *   **B: Jọọstụ (Jousts):** Jousts were a real and well-documented form of medieval entertainment and combat, though their romanticized depiction sometimes overshadows the more brutal realities.
    *   **C: Shivalrị (Chivalry):** Chivalry was a code of conduct associated with knights, influencing their behavior and ideals. While the extent to which it was practiced perfectly is debatable, it was a documented concept.
    *   **D: Naịtị (Knights):** Knights were a very real and essential part of the medieval castle system, playing military, social, and political roles.

*   **Therefore:** Dungeons are the most mythologized of the terms given, and are often depicted in ways that do not align with factual documentation."
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-emetụghị aka na mpaghara akwụkwọ dị ka ísì ma ọ bụ ụda nke nwere ike ịpụta n'agbata mkpoko kastụlụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Nri oriri**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions the possibility of imagining the sounds and smells of battles, including ""isi ụjọ si n'olulu ekuli"" (the smell of fear from the dungeons) and the sounds of horses (""ụda ụkwụ ịnyịnya""). It also mentions sounds of battle (""ụda ma isi agha a lụrụ oge gara aga).
*   While the passage mentions ""memme añụrị, oriri na nkwari"" (joyful celebrations, feasting, and revelry), the question asks what is *not* touched upon regarding what might emanate from the castle ruins. While feasts did happen in castles, the question seems to ask what sensations (sight, smell, sound) the ruins might conjure. The other answers focus on things that are more directly tied to the *atmosphere* the ruins might create through senses.

Therefore, while feasts were part of castle life, ""nri oriri"" is less directly connected to the sensory experience evoked by the castle ruins in the context of the passage compared to the other options.
"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a bụ nkọpụta ezie kpọmkwem nke Kastụlụ Kirby Muxloe?,"The correct answer is **B: Ọ chọrọ obere mkpụchi n'ihi ụdị udo obodo n’oge mwube ya.**

Here's why:

*   **P states:** ""...obodo nọ n'udo ma sọ mgbachite onwe bụ n'imegide obere igwe ndị ohi."" This directly supports the idea that Lord Hastings needed less robust defenses due to the peaceful environment at the time of construction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lọọdụ Hastings yọrọ wọlụ kastụlụ dị ike:** The passage implies the opposite - that it *wasn't* a particularly strong castle for the time.

*   **C: Mwube nke kastụlụ abụghị ihe na-adịkarị maka oge ahụ:** The passage states that it was ""ụkarịrị maka oge ahụ"", meaning it was unusual for the time.

*   **D: A rụrụ ya iji nagide ogologo na mkpebi mwakpo di ike:** The passage states that the castle likely wouldn't withstand a determined attack for long."
Kedu n'ime atụmatụ ihe owuwu ndị a ka a ga-ewere dị ka Kastụlụ nke Kirby Muxloe n'oge akọwara n'akụkụ akwụkwọ a?,"The passage states: ""Large windows and rich tapestries would not have been able to hold off a determined assault for long."" This indicates that large windows were a feature of Kirby Muxloe Castle. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Nnukwu windo**
"
"Dika mpaghara akwụkwọ a si kwuo, kedu ihe kachasi uru maka ọgbaọsọ na-akwado mmemme na-abịa n’ihu?","The correct answer is **D: Iji jim nkeọma n’ịrụ ọrụ nke elu ahụ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ụfọdụ ịgba ọsọ n’ofe mba n’oge oyi, ejikọtara ya na ọrụ mgbatị ahụ maka akụkụ ahụ nke elu, bụ njikere kachasị mma maka oge agbamọsọ ahụ.""  This translates to: ""Some cross-country running in the winter, combined with upper body workouts, is the best preparation for the race season.""

The passage directly links cross-country and upper body strength training as the most effective preparation.
"
"Ịsonyere mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee otu n’ime ihe ndi a dịkasiri mkpa maka ọgbaọsọ maịlị-ọkara klasị-iziz?","The correct answer is **B: Ịnwe mmasị ịnwe nnagide tinyekwuru ikeọsọ** (Having more endurance than speed).

Here's why:

*   The passage clearly states that when switching from short sprints to the half-mile, endurance becomes more important. While speed is still necessary, the emphasis is on endurance training.
*   Option B directly reflects this emphasis on endurance being more critical than speed for the half-mile.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Ịmụ ịgbaọsọ ngafe obodo n’oge ọnwa winta (Learning to run cross-country in the winter months):** The passage says cross-country running is *good preparation* for the running season, but not necessarily the most critical quality for a half-mile runner. It's about general conditioning.
*   **C: Ịmecha na-erughi nkeji abụọ (Finishing in under two minutes):** While a good half-mile runner might aim for under two minutes, the passage says the runner must have good speed, *but endurance must be developed*. This is a *goal*, not a core quality.
*   **D: Ịnwe mmasị inweta ike ọsọ karịa nnagịde (Having more speed than endurance):** This is the opposite of what the passage argues. Endurance is more important for the half-mile."
"Maka onye egwuregwu, olee n’ihe ndị a ka eneghị ike inweta naanị n’ihe oriri?","Based on the passage, the answer is **C: Ikeọrụ ọmachancha (Exceptional performance)**.

The passage states that good nutrition *won't* bring exceptional performance, but *will* affect an athlete's overall well-being. The other options (Obi aṅụrị emelitara - Enhanced well-being, Ikeọrụ akwalitere - Improved performance, Ọdịmma n’ihe niile - Overall well-being) are all benefits that *can* be achieved through proper nutrition, according to the passage.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on nutrition, hydration, and understanding supplements as ways to improve performance and enjoyment.**
* Options A, C, and D (eating well, staying hydrated, and having unwavering self-confidence) align with the principles discussed in the passage as contributors to well-being and performance.
* Option B (working out with an official referee all the time) is related to fairness, and doesn’t help the athletes get more joy from their sport.
"
"Dika mpaghara akwụkwọ si kwuo, gịnị ka onye ọgbaọsọ nke etiti ji wee ike ịzụta igwe arụmọrụ dị ọnụ?","The correct answer is **A: Ọ bụ ihe nkeonwe ha ka mkpa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that players might buy items even if they have little to no performance impact. This aligns directly with option A. They are buying it because of their personal preference, not necessarily because of any demonstrable benefit.
*   Option B, C, and D aren't really supported by the passage. The passage says that some items *don't* improve performance much."
"Isonyere n’akụkụ akwụkwọ a, kedu ịgba ọsọ ogo etiti chọrọ?","The correct answer is **C: Igweọrụ dị oke nta**.

The passage states that speedrunning is inexpensive compared to other games and requires very few supplies to participate. It also mentions that while some items can be purchased, they have minimal to no impact on performance. This implies that only very minimal equipment is needed.
"
Onye chọpụtara rezọnansi magnetiki? ,"The correct answer is **C: Blochị na Purcellu**.

The passage states that Felix Bloch and Edward Purcell discovered Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), which is the basis for MRI.

"Isonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ, olee ihe ndị mmadụ kwesịrị ike na iji kọwapụta omume ana-ahụ anya ndị ọzọ?","The correct answer is **B: Nzube (Nzube)**.

The passage explicitly states the importance of understanding others' intentions (""Ọ dị nnọọ mkpa ịghọta ebumnuche ndị ọzọ"") and how it helps avoid misinterpreting their actions. The example given about breaking into a car illustrates how understanding the *intention* (stealing vs. lost keys) drastically changes the interpretation of the observed behavior.  While beliefs and understanding are important, the text focuses on *intent* as the key factor for explaining observed actions.
"
"Isonye ka akụkụ akwụkwọ a si kwu, olee ihe ịghọta ebumunuche na-enyere ndị mmadụ aka ime?","The correct answer is **A: ị ji wepụ ihe amaghị ama dị n’omume ana-ahụ anya**.

Here's why:

The passage states that understanding others' intentions helps us ""avoid misinterpreting their actions."" This directly relates to removing ambiguity or the ""unknown"" from observed behavior. The example of the person breaking into a car illustrates this: without knowing their intention (stealing vs. retrieving keys), the action is open to misinterpretation. Understanding the intention clarifies the meaning of the action.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: I ji kwuo n’onwe ọchịchọ obi mmadụ:** While understanding intentions can give insight into desires, the passage focuses on clarifying actions, not definitively stating someone's innermost desires.
*   **C: Ị hụ ndị ọzọ ndị ọzọ na-ekpeghị ikpe:** It can help with not judging others; the main focus is on understanding their actions.
*   **D: Ị gụ uche ndị ọzọ:** The passage does not suggest mind-reading. It mentions that understanding ebumnuche ndị ọzọ, not reading their minds."
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, kedu n'ime ihe ndị a bụ nchikọta ọma nke uru AI?","Based on the provided text, the best answer is:

**C: Ị hazi oge**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions ""ịtụ arọ na ịhàzi oge"" (management, weighing, and time organization) as examples of tasks that require procedural intelligence, which AI research aims to replicate.
*   The other options are mentioned, but not as directly related to the core function of AI trying to replicate tasks that require procedural intelligence."
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ, olee ihe ndị a na-ejikọtakarị na AI?","The correct answer is **D: Ị chọpụta aka edemede**.

The passage mentions ""ịmata aka odide, olu na ihu"" as examples of what AI research includes. While the passage also mentions ""Ị hazị ihe na ị hazị oge"", answer D is the most specific and direct example provided in the text.

"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee n'ime ihe ndị a bụ ike nke onye nwere ụdịdi echiche mgbakọ?","The correct answer is **D: ị nweta usoro ibu ihe n'uche** (memorizing a process).

Here's why:

*   **P describes Computational Thinking:** The passage clearly describes computational thinking as a problem-solving approach focused on speed, logic, accuracy, identifying patterns, applying existing processes, and condensing information. A key aspect is the idea of a single correct answer (""enwere naanị otu ụsa"").
*   **Computational Thinking strengths:** The passage states that people with this thinking style are good at memorizing processes, solving problems, and conducting scientific experiments.
*   **Option Analysis:**
    *   **A: Ịchọpụta ọtụtụ azịza nyere otu nsogbu** (Finding multiple solutions to a problem) - This contradicts the core principle of computational thinking as described in the passage (""enwere naanị otu ụsa"").
    *   **B: Ị tinye n’ọrụ usoro ọhụrụ n’otu nsogbu** (Applying new methods to a problem) - While flexibility can be useful, the passage emphasizes applying *existing* processes, not necessarily creating completely new ones.
    *   **C: Ị weputa oge n’imezi nsogbu** (Taking time to solve a problem) - Computational thinking prioritizes speed, so this doesn't align.
    *   **D: ị nweta usoro ibu ihe n’uche** (Memorizing a process) - This is directly mentioned as a strength of individuals with computational thinking."
"Dika akụkụ akwụkwọ si kwu, kedu ihe enweghị usorouche ụdịdị echiche mgbakọ?","Based on the passage, the core principle of convergent thinking is that ""enwere naanị otu ụsa"" (there is only one answer).  Therefore, the *opposite* of that would be something lacking in convergent thinking.

The correct answer is **B: Ị were oge mmadụ**. While the passage doesn't explicitly state convergent thinking lacks time, the other options are direct characteristics mentioned. Speed and efficiency are hallmarks of convergent thinking.
"
"Ịsonyere na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee ihe agaghị anabata dịka okwu dị nta?","Based on the passage and the context of micro-expressions related to detecting deception, the least likely answer to be a micro-expression would be:

**D: Iweli isi mkpịsị aka elu (Raising a finger)**

Here's why:

*   **Micro-expressions are subtle facial movements:** The passage focuses on facial movements (""facial micro-expressions,"" ""minute movements of the face""). Options A, B, and C all involve facial movements.
*   **Raising a finger is a larger, more conscious gesture:** It's a deliberate body language cue, not a subtle, involuntary expression. It can be easily controlled, and therefore less likely to reveal hidden emotions or deception.

Therefore, option **D** is the most appropriate answer because it is a deliberate body gesture, and less likely to be regarded as a micro-expression."
Olee n’ime edemede a maka nkọwa okwu dị nta ziri ezi?,"The best answer is **B: Nkọwa ziri ezi nwere ike ịchọpụta ịgha ụgha** (Accurate interpretations can detect lying).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Akachasị ekwu na mmadụ nwere ike ịma mmgbe mmadụ na atụ asi ma ọbụrụ na onwere ike ịkọwapụta obere mmegharị ahụ dị iche iche ọfụma."" This translates to ""It is often said that one can know when someone is lying if one can accurately identify subtle movements.""

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ihe ndekọ vidiyo ebutela ọganihu dị ukwuu** (Video recording has led to great progress): While true according to the passage, it's a broader statement.  The specific point being made is *how* that progress helps.
* **C: A tụgharịkwara okwu yana ọnọdụ ihu** (Words and facial expressions are translated): This is not mentioned in the text, at least not explicitly. The focus is on subtle facial movements, not translation or general expressions.
* **D: Ọ nwere ike inye aka nyochaa ezi obi** (It can help verify honesty): This is similar to B, but B is a more direct and stronger claim that is explicitly stated in the passage.

Olee n'ime ihe ndị a dị oke nweta uru karịa n'ihi Renayizansị? ,"Based on the passage, the Renaissance emphasized the importance of remembering texts over remembering individuals. Therefore, the most valuable outcome of the Renaissance, according to the passage, is:

*   **C: Nchetagharị edemede (Remembering texts)**

So the answer is C."
"N'ihi nke Renayizansi, olee ihe emetụtara obere aka n’ime ya?","The correct answer is **A: Nchetagharị mmadụ**.

The passage states that ""Ọ bụghịzị ịcheta mmadụ ka onye ọbụla na-ekwu okwu ya, kama ọ bụ ikikere ịcheta edemede ka etinyeziri uche"" which translates to ""It's no longer remembering people as someone speaks of him, but rather the ability to remember text that is emphasized"". This directly implies a decreased emphasis on memorizing individuals compared to texts during the Renaissance.

Therefore, connecting with family and exploring new social groups both fit with the idea of ongoing social interaction.

Of the options, only **C: Ịnyocha ime njem (Exploring travel)** isn't directly related to maintaining or creating social connections. It is instead related to the exploration of places and possible locations.

So the answer is **C**.
"
Olee ihe na-egosipụtaghị mkpalite iji ịntanetị maka ntinye aka nkeonwe?,"The passage mentions ""learning,"" ""companionship,"" ""inclusion,"" and ""social presence"" as motivations for using the internet. These relate to personal engagement and connection.

*   **A: Ị le anya n’usoro (Looking at trends):** While trends could be related to personal interests, it's less directly about personal connection or learning compared to the other options.
*   **B: Ịziga ozi n’ogwe mkpakọrita ụka n’intaneeti (Sending messages in online discussion forums):** This is a clear example of seeking inclusion and social presence.

*   **D: Ịlekwata ihe akụ na ụba (Watching economic indicators):** While useful, this is less directly tied to personal connection or personal growth like learning.

Therefore, the best answer is **D: Ịlekwata ihe akụ na ụba (Watching economic indicators)**."

"Isonyere na mpaghara akwụkwọ, gịni n’ime ihe ndịa ka anabatara dika ihe ngwọta nwere ogologo oge maka nsogbu gburugburu ebe obibi?","The correct answer is **C: Ịmata ihe kpatara nsogbu ihe ahụ (Identifying the root cause of the problems)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that while environmental actions and advocacy can provide temporary relief, **""ọ bụrụ na anyị achọghị naanị ọsịsa nke nwa oge, ya mere anyị kwesịrị ịchọta isi ihe kpatara nsogbu ndị ahụ, ma anyị kwesịrị iwepụ̀ ike ha.""** This translates to ""if we don't only want temporary relief, then we should find the root cause of the problems and eliminate their power.""

The other options are:

*   A: Ịkwụsị nhọrọ ibi ndụ okomoko (Stopping the choice of living a luxurious life) - While the passage mentions overconsumption (""ibifụga ndụ ókè nke ụmụ mmadụ""), it doesn't directly state that eliminating luxurious lifestyles is the sole long-term solution.
*   B: Iheomume (Environmentalism) - The passage states that environmentalism is more like chemotherapy in many ways which means it's good but not long term.
*   D: Ịbụ onye nkwado otu ịnvirọmentalụ (Being an environmental group supporter) - Similar to environmentalism it is not stated as a sole way for long term solution.

"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, kedụ ihe ndozi ndị a na-agaghị anabata ka ọgwụgwọ dị mma nke nsogbu ịnvịrọmentalụ?","The correct answer is **B: Ịwela isi ọnọdụ kpatara ihe ahụ (Failing to address the root causes)**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes finding and eliminating the root causes of environmental problems.** It criticizes temporary fixes (like symptom management with chemotherapy) and advocates for addressing the core issues driving the problems.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ịsonye n’iheomume (Participating in movements)** The passage encourages joining environmental movements but also emphasizes that action alone isn't enough; you need to understand and address the root causes.
* **C: Ịkwupụta echicheobi maka nhọrọ ụdị ndụ (Expressing opinions about lifestyle choices)** While lifestyle changes are implied, the focus is on systemic issues and not just individual opinions.
* **D: Inọ ndụ na gburugburu ebe obibi n’usoro ịme obi ụtọ (Living in the environment in order to be happy)** While being environmentally conscious can bring happiness, this answer does not address what a non-solution would be to fixing an environmental problem.

Therefore, failing to address the underlying causes is the key factor that makes a solution ineffective, according to the passage."

The passage specifically mentions that the concentration of power and wealth within the Church led many to question whether its principles were still being followed. This directly relates to the question of whether the Church's economic power was justified.
"
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, onye ka e gburu na Vasaillisi?","The correct answer is **D: Onyenche**.

The passage states that ""otu n'ime ndị igwe mmadụ fegharịrị isi onye nche eze egburu na Versailles n'ihu eze nwanyi ụjọ ji"". This clearly indicates that a royal guard was killed at Versailles.

Let's examine the other options:

*   **A: Ebumuche Germani iso ụzọ agha nke amara** While the passage mentions that Germany responded in kind with submarine warfare, it doesn't necessarily frame it as a goal for Germany to follow the war tactic of Britain
*   **C: A gbanwere iwu mba ụwa** The passage mentions that the blockade violated international law. However, it does not suggest the changing of this law occurred, it only questions its enforcement.
*   **D: Enwetaghị ihe gasị dị mkpa** The text asserts, ""Atụmatụ ahụ rụrụ ọrụ ọfụma, na-ebepụ ụmụ ihe mbute ihe ndị agha na ndị nkiti dị oke mpka,"". From this we can conclude the blockade was successful in preventing the import of certain materials."

"Isonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, onye ka enwere ike ịchoputa Ọtụtu Cerosisi?","The correct answer is **A: Nwanyị dị afọ 32**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a major neurological disease affecting young adults and older adults.
*   It also mentions that women are twice as likely to develop MS than men.
*   Options A and D are women. However, MS commonly affects young adults so, a 32 year old woman is more likely to have MS than a 10 year old woman.

Therefore, the most probable answer based on the information in the passage is a 32-year-old woman."
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, gịni ka ndị mmemekarị chokariri na nkwado?","Based on the passage, the answer is **A: Echiche na-adịghị mma maka ihemgbu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the study identified ""catastrophizing"" (which is having negative thoughts about pain, exaggerating its severity and expecting the worst outcomes) among the feelings of people suffering from chronic lower back pain.
*   The passage indicates that individuals who catastrophize more often need more help coping with pain than feeling pain in general.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Azụ dị ala** is simply a condition causing pain.
*   **C: Obi ịju oyi** (Isolation) is mentioned as a result of planned PA groups.
*   **D: Ụjọ** (Anxiety) is mentioned but then negated as the primary factor.

Olee mgbanwe nke Frenchi Revolushọn kwadoro nwere nrita uru na nwafọ obodo na-arụ ọrụ?,"The most accurate answer based on the provided text is **B: Ịgbanwe ọchịchọ site na klaasị gaa na ikikere** (Changing the pursuit of career from class to competence).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions that the revolution opened positions to *all* men, ""allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed."" This indicates a shift from a system where class or birth determined your career path to one where your abilities (""ikikere"") mattered more.

Let's examine why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Nkwalite nkwado maka obodo** (Promotion of support for the community): While the text touches on a sense of community, it doesn't directly emphasize increased support *for* the community. It's more about the community having precedence over individual rulers.

*   **C: Nnabata omenala ndị Republikanụ** (Acceptance of Republican culture): The passage mentions the move from individual rule to national rule, this may be a precursor to a republican culture.

*   **D: Sistemu nmekwa nha ọhụrụ** (New equality system): While the revolution aimed for equality, the text focuses more on equal *opportunity* for career advancement rather than a broader system of equality across all aspects of life."
"Ịsonyere na Frenchi Revolushọnụ, kedụ ihe ọganihu ndị agha na ọrụ ndị ọzọ na-adịkarichaghị mkpa?","The correct answer is **B: Kụlasị** (Class).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on shifts in social structure:** The passage describes how the French Revolution moved away from a system where power was concentrated in the hands of a single ruler and towards a system based on merit and the common good. It talks about how opportunities opened up for ambitious individuals and how promotions in the military were based on merit rather than rank. These changes directly relate to a shift in social classes and the traditional hierarchy.
* **Other options don't fit the context as well:**
    * **Ihemweta (Achievement):** While achievement is related to the new system based on merit, the passage is primarily about the *structure* that allows for achievement, not just the achievement itself.
    * **Ebumnobi (Objective):** While there were objectives of the revolution, the passage is more focused on the societal and structural changes it brought about.
    * **Mkpalite (Motivation):** The passage mentions how the revolution motivated oppressed people in other countries, but the primary focus remains on the changes in social and political structures, particularly related to class.

Therefore, ""Kụlasị"" (Class) best captures the main theme of the passage, which is the transformation of the social hierarchy and the diminished importance of traditional class structures.

The passage explicitly discusses the frequent complaints and failures associated with public transportation systems. The other options (water quality, bridge construction, and education) are mentioned as things that receive *fewer* complaints in developed countries, implying that public transport is the more problematic area.
"
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, gịnị ka enwere ike maka sistemu ime njem ọha?","The correct answer is **C: Ha na-akpatara onye na-eji ha ọtụtụ mkpesa**.

"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee ihe nwere ike sie ike ntule maka enweghị usoro kwesiri ekwesi nke ndị ọkwọ ụgbọala?","The passage discusses the challenges of predicting driver behavior in traffic flow due to its inherent variability.  The question asks what could be difficult to estimate due to the lack of consistent driver behavior.

*   **A: Tụrafiki Velọciti (Traffic Velocity)** - Traffic velocity, while affected by driver behavior, is directly related to flow and density, which the passage states can be modeled. The variability in driver behavior makes precise prediction hard, but not impossible to estimate.
*   **B: Nhazi okporo ụzọ (Road Design)** - Road design is a structural element and not directly influenced by the inconsistencies in driver's behavior.
*   **C: Ọrụ okporo ụzọ gasị (Traffic Function)** - Traffic function isn't related with the estimation.
*   **D: Usoro Tụrafiki (Traffic Pattern)** - Traffic patterns are the overall movements of vehicles, which, according to the passage, have consistent elements that allow for arithmetic representation. The passage states that drivers exhibit behavioral patterns which are why traffic patterns are to some degree predictable.

Even though driver behavior makes prediction harder, it is still possible to model traffic patterns because some driver behaviors stay consistent.
Thus, considering the question's emphasis on the difficulty due to driver variability, the best answer is **A: Tụrafiki Velọciti (Traffic Velocity)**. The inconsistency of how driver behave makes it harder to determine exactly how fast they will be going.

Therefore, the answer is **A**."
Kedụ n’ime ihe ndị edesitara bụ nkọwa kachamma mgbe eji strimu matịmatiksi egosipụta tụrafiki?,"The correct answer is **A: Ọrụ okporo ụzọ gasị** (Traffic flow).

Here's why:

* The passage states that relationships have been developed between three key characteristics: flow, density, and speed. These relationships are used to represent traffic movement mathematically. Traffic flow is the most comprehensive of these choices, encompassing the overall movement and behavior of traffic, which is what the mathematical models aim to represent.
* Density is also one of the three key characteristics, but flow is more encompassing as it talks about the actual movement of the cars rather than just how close they are to each other.
* The passage does mention driver behavior and road design, but these are not the *result* of the mathematical representation, they are simply things that affect it.

Here's why:

*   **The passage clearly states: ""Ọ bụ nanị mgbanwe na mkpụrụ ndụ jem-laịn ka a ga-enyefe ụmụaka""** This translates to ""Only mutations in germ-line cells will be passed on to offspring."" Germ-line cells are reproductive cells (sperm and egg). Therefore, whether or not a mutation is in a germ-line cell is the PRIMARY determinant of whether it can be inherited.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ngosipụta nke arụmọrụ genetiki (Expression of genetic function):** While the effect of a mutation (how it's expressed) matters for its impact, it doesn't determine *whether* it's inherited in the first place.
*   **C: Ụdị muteshọnụ (Type of mutation):** The type of mutation (e.g., point mutation, deletion) affects its *effect*, but not necessarily its inheritability. A mutation of any type will only be inherited if it is in the germ line
*   **D: Ma ọ bụrụ na muteshọnụ nwere ike ịkpata ọnwụ celu (Whether the mutation can cause cell death):** Cell death induced by a mutation is an important consequence that has some other possible outcome like Cancer. However, this doesn't directly dictate whether the mutation gets passed on to offspring. If a mutation in a germ-line cell doesn't kill the cell, it can still be passed on, even if it's harmful.

Therefore, the answer is **A**"
"Na ịdabere n’ozi dị n’edemede a, kedụ ọtụtụ ihe muteshọnụ kpatara na-adabereghị na ya?","Based on the provided text, the correct answers are:

*   **D: Ụdị muteshọnụ emetụtara** (The type of mutation involved)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly states that the effects of a mutation depend on:

1.  The type of mutation.
2.  The function of the gene it affects.
3.  Whether the affected cells are germ-line cells.

The question asks, ""how many mutation effects are dependent on?"" The text lists three variables, which correspond to A, B, and D. C is a result of the mutation, not something the effect depends on."

*   The passage states, ""Ajọ ifufe ndị kacha njọ bụ pasentị abụọ na-anọ karịa awa atọ."" (The worst tornadoes are only about two percent and they last more than three hours.). This implies that *most* tornadoes do *not* last more than three hours, making option C untrue based on the text.

Let's look at why the other options are true according to the text:

*   **A: Tonadọsụ nwere ikikere ịmebi ihe dum nọ ya nso** (Tornadoes are capable of damaging everything in their path) - The passage says, ""...ha nwere ike imebi ihe niile nọ n’ụzọ ha"" (...they have the power to damage everything in their path.)
*   **B: Tonadọsụ na-emebi dị nta karịa oke ikuku ndị ọzọ** (Tornadoes cause damage to a smaller area than other storms) - The passage begins by saying, ""Ajọọ ifufe Tonedo na-efetu obere ebe ma ịtụnyere ya na ajọọ ifufe ndị ọzọ..."" (Tornadoes affect smaller areas compared to other storms...)
*   **D: Ụfọdụ tonadọsụ nwere ikikere inwe ikuku ruru maịlị 300 kwa awa** (Some tornadoes are capable of having winds up to 300 miles per hour) - The passage says, ""Ikuku oke ifufe ndị a na-erucha 480 kilomita kwa awa (133 maịlụ kwa nkeji; 300 maịlụ kwa awa) n'ọsọ"" (These extreme tornado winds can reach 480 kilometers per hour (133 meters per second; 300 miles per hour) in speed).
"
"Na ịdabanyere na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee n'ime edemede ndị a kọwara nke ọma ọtụtụ ihe gbasara tonadọsụ?","The correct answer is **D: Ha ga-abọli osisi na mgbọrọgwụ ya.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that tornadoes ""na efolite osisi"" which directly translates to ""uproot trees"". Therefore, option D best describes what the passage states about tornadoes.

Here's why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **A: Ha na-emekarị ihe karịrị awa atọ:** The passage states that the *worst* tornadoes last *up to* three hours (""pasentị abụọ na-anọ karịa awa atọ""), not that they typically last *more than* three hours.
*   **B: Ha na-emepụta ikuku dịka maịlị 480 kwa awa:** The passage states that the *worst* tornadoes can reach speeds of 300 mph (converted from 480 km/h), not 480 miles per hour.
*   **C: Ha na-emebi ebe dị ukwuu karịa oke ikuku ndị ọzọ:** The passage states the opposite, that tornadoes affect a *smaller* area than other storms (""obere ebe ma ịtụnyere ya na ajọọ ifufe ndị ọzọ"")."

"N’isonye ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a si kwu, kedụ ihe kevu Muhammad kwuru maka wu gbasara omume ma ọ bụ ụkpụrụ ime mmụọ ya?","The correct answer is **C: Ọ chọrọ oge dị ntakịrị ịnọrọ onwe ya**

Here's why:

*   The passage describes Muhammad's habit of going to the cave ""Hira"" for **reflection**.
*   The passage emphasizes the cave's **isolation** and **seclusion**: ""nnukwu ọnụala dịpụrụ adịpụ n’ozuzu site n’akụkụ ụwa ndị ọzọ niile"" and ""Ozugbo abanyere n'ime ọgba ahụ, ọ bụ ndịpụ kpam kpam""
*   The description suggests that Muhammad was seeking solitude and a break from the world, meaning he desired time to be alone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ọ nabatara udo na ịnọpụ iche**: While the cave provided peace and isolation, the passage doesn't directly state that Muhammad *valued* peace. He could have valued the solitude itself.
*   **B: Ịme mkpọtụ ezi nwere ike nye ntụgharị uche aka**: This is the opposite of what the passage suggests. The cave's isolation implies a desire to escape noise and distraction.
*   **D: Ọ chọsiri ike ịhụ ya ma nụ ya**: This is also the opposite. The passage says, ""Nanị obere nke ụwa ka enwere ike ịhụ ma ọ bụ nụ site n’ime nnukwu ọnụala ahụ,"" indicating that he sought a place *away* from worldly sights and sounds."
"Isonye ka akụkụ akwụkwọ ahụ si kwuo, kedụ ihe e ji ígwe emebe n’izizi?","The correct answer is **B: Okporo ụzọ wagọnụ**.

The passage states: ""Obere obere a bịa mata na ụzọ ụgbọoloko ga-esikarị ike ma ọ bụrụ na o nweturu obere igwe n’elu ya."" This translates to: ""It was slowly realized that wagonways would be stronger if they had a little iron on them."" This means iron was first used on the wagonways (okporo ụzọ wagọnụ).
"
"Dịka akụkụ akwụkwọ a si dee, gịnị mere eji were whilu igwe dochie anya whilu osisi?","The correct answer is **D: Eji igwe dị na ya na-adọkasị n’okporo ụzọ ha**.

The passage states: ""igwe ahụ kpatakwuru ndọwa n'ụkwụ ụmụ ụgbọ ibu ejiri osisi mee. N'ikpeazụ, eji wiil ígwè dochie wiil osisi."" This directly implies that iron caused damage to the wooden wheels, leading to their replacement with iron wheels.
"
"Isonye ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a si dee, kedụ ihe mebere ndị mmadụ na mgbe nke Romantisizimu?","The correct answer is **B: Jiogụrafii (Geography)**.

The passage states that in Romanticism, one's ""ala ebe onye no"" (place of origin/geographical location) greatly influenced a person's character. This aligns directly with the concept of geography shaping identity.
"
"N'ime edemede ndị a, olee nke na-egosipụtaghị ebumunobi ziri ezi nke nkwekọrịta teknọlọjikụl? ","The correct answer is **A: Ụdị mmekọrịta mmadụ na-emetụta ọnọdụ teknọlọjii na mbara mmadụ.**

Here's why:

*   **Technological Determinism (nkwekọrịta teknọlọjikụl):** The passage describes technological determinism as the idea that technology develops independently of cultural or political influences and unilaterally shapes society.

Let's break down why the other options are aligned with technological determinism, and why option A is not:

*   **B: Mmelite nke teknọlọjii enweghị ihe omenaka na-eme ya** (Technological development is unaffected by culture): This is a core tenet of technological determinism - the idea that technology progresses independently.
*   **C: Teknọlọjii na-emetụta ọnọdụ ọha mmadụ** (Technology affects the state of society): Technological determinism argues that technology is a primary driver of societal change.
*   **D: Mmelite teknọlọjikụl agbasaghị ụkwụ na ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị obodo** (Technological development does not depend on the politics of a community): This is aligned with the idea that technology develops independently of political considerations.

*   **A: Ụdị mmekọrịta mmadụ na-emetụta ọnọdụ teknọlọjii na mbara mmadụ** (The way people relate affects the state of technology in the world): This statement directly contradicts technological determinism. It suggests that societal factors influence technological development, which is the opposite of the deterministic view. It suggests human relationships and actions can direct technological development.

Therefore, option A is the one that does *not* represent a premise of technological determinism."
"Isonye ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a si dee, olee n’ime ihe ndịa na-adakọtaghị n’ịkpụlite ụta?","The correct answer is **A: O nwere ụda dịtụ nro**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""ụta-elu"" (up-bow) typically produces a softer sound, not ""ụta-ala"" (down-bow). Therefore, option A is incorrect.
*   The passage states the up-bow looks like a V and the down-bow looks like a staple. Therefore, option B is correct.
*   The passage states that ""ụta-ala"" typically produces a strong and pronounced sound. Therefore, option C is correct.
*   The passage states that down-bow means that you draw the bow beginning at the frog. Therefore, option D is correct."
"Isonye ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a si dee, olee n’ime ihe ndịa ka ya na ụda dị juu n’adakọrịta ?","The correct answer is **A: Akara ụta dị ala**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""Otu ụta-elu na -emepụtakarị ụda kara dị nro, ebe ụta-ala ka sie ike ma kara kwupụta."" This directly links ""ụta-elu"" (implied by the opposite ""ụta dị ala"") with a softer sound, and ""ụta dị ala"" with a louder, more pronounced sound.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ịdọlite ụta** - The passage discusses pulling the bow during a down-bow, which produces a louder sound, not a quieter one.
*   **C: Akara ana-ele dịka V** - The passage is describing a ""ụta elu"" (up-bow) mark.
*   **D: Ịbido n’ebe aka gị na-ejigide ụta** - Starting at the grip on the bow relates to a down-bow which is also a louder more pronounced sound."
Fọsilụ na-egosi n’aka mechara ka ejiri ya mee ihe maka nke gịnị na ndịa?,"The passage states that fossil hand bones from 2-3 million years ago reveal a shift ""from locomotion to manipulation"". Manipulation means skillful handling, controlling, or using something. Therefore, the best answer is:

This directly implies that chimpanzee hands and feet are used to bear weight during knuckle-walking. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: Eji ha anagide ibu**

Kedụ ọdọ mmiri nke nhọrọ na-ewepụ varieshọnụ genetiki ọhụrụ?,"The correct answer is **D: Nke ekwuru** (The one that is expressed).

Therefore, selection acts on the **expressed** variation.

"""Idabere n’ozi dị na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee otu n'ime ndị a ka pụrimeti kwesịrị iri ka omezie """"nsogbu protini""""?""","The passage states:

*   Plant matter (leaves and legumes) contains protein, but is difficult for human-like primates to digest raw.
*   Animal products (insects, eggs) are easier to digest and provide complete proteins.
*   The ancestors of humans probably obtained protein the same way wild primates do today.

Therefore, to solve the ""protein problem,"" primates would rely on what's easily digestible and provides complete protein.

**The correct answer is C: Igwurube (Insects)**

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Akwụkwọ osisi nwụrụ anwụ (Dead leaves):** While leaves contain *some* protein, the passage emphasizes the difficulty primates have digesting raw plant matter.
*   **B: Legumu esibeghị n’ọkụ (Uncooked legumes):** The passage explicitly states that raw legumes are hard to digest without cooking.
*   **D: Stemụ Fụlawa (Flower stems):** Similar to leaves, while flower stems might contain some nutrients, they are not highlighted as a good source of complete, easily digestible protein."
"Dika mpaghara akwụkwọ si dee, olee nsogbu bụ nke enweghị amino acidi na-akpata ?","The passage states that failing to meet amino acid requirements results in:

*   ""nnukwu ndamụmbà"" (major illnesses)
*   ""ọtịtaahụ"" (weakening)
*   ""nakwa ọnwụ n'ikpeazụ"" (and eventual death)

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Ọnwụ (Death)**."
Olee ka ndị otu sọbụkọchọ na-esi egosipụtakarị mmekọrịta ha n’otu?,"The correct answer is **D: Ha na-eji ụdịdị ka ọbụrụ ihe nlereanya**.

*   The passage states: ""Ndịòtù nke otu okpuru omenala na-akpọtụrụkarị ịdị n'òtù ha site n'otu ojiji akanka pụrụ iche ma dịmara, nke gụnyere ụmụ ejiji, omume, na asụsụ ịgba izu."" This translates to: ""Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a unique and recognizable use of symbols, which includes fashion, behavior, and slang.""
*   Option D, ""Ha na-eji ụdịdị ka ọbụrụ ihe nlereanya"" means ""They use styles as examples"" or ""They use styles to identify themselves."" This aligns perfectly with the passage's description of subcultures using distinctive styles (fashion, behaviors, language) to signal membership.

The other options are not explicitly stated in the text."

This change in performance is a direct result of psychological impact.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that one of the most recognized principles about the value of relationships is how detrimental it is when children who are abandoned, neglected, or abused lack social interaction with adults during their formative years.
*   The passage discusses ""feral children"" who, when raised entirely by non-human animals, exhibit behaviors similar to those of their animal caretakers, including fear or lack of fear of humans. This demonstrates the negative impact of lacking appropriate social interaction.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nkwarụ ahụ bụ ihe na-akpatakarị ọtụtu omume ọjọo ụmụaka** (Physical disability is the main cause of bad behavior in children) - The passage mentions physical defects as a reason why some children are abandoned, but it doesn't say that physical disability itself causes bad behavior.
*   **C: Omume ọjọọ bụ naanị ụmụaka ndị ha na nne na nna ha nọ** (Bad behavior is only in children who stay with their parents) - This is directly contradicted by the passage, which focuses on children who are abandoned, neglected, or abused.
*   **D: Ọgụgụ isi ezughị oke na-akpatakwa ụmụaka ịme omume ọjọo** (Not having enough IQ causes children to do bad behavior) - The passage mentions intellectual defects as a reason for abandoment, but it doesn't claim that not enough IQ causes bad behavior."
"Isonye na mpaghara edemede a, olee omume na-adịchaghị n’ọrụ ụgbọ dabere na nrị?","Based on the provided text, the least common practice in subsistence farming is:

Here's why:

*   Subsistence farming, as described in paragraph P, prioritizes producing enough food for the farmer's household. It emphasizes simple methods, local seeds, and self-sufficiency.

Let's look at why the other options are more likely in subsistence farming:

*   A: Ịlekwasị anya n’ihe ndi ga-enyere ezinulo onye ọrụ ụgbọ aka (Focusing on what will feed the farmer's family) - This is the *primary* goal of subsistence farming.
*   B: Ịkọpụta ihe oriri a ga-eresị ndị ọzọ (Producing food to sell to others) - While some surplus might be sold, the main focus is on household needs, making selling a secondary consideration.
*   D: Ịchọpụta mkpụrụ osisi dị n’ebe onye ọrụ ugbo si (Using seeds local to the farmer's area) - Paragraph P specifically mentions the use of local seeds.

Therefore, focusing on advanced methods for large profits is the least likely practice in traditional subsistence farming."

Here's why:

*   The passage describes traditional farming as simple, using saved seeds, and focusing on maximizing yield with basic methods. This aligns with the concept of organic farming, which relies on natural processes and avoids synthetic inputs.

The other options don't accurately reflect the description of traditional farming in the passage:

*   **B: A na-emelite nri site n’iji tekniki pụrụiche:** The passage emphasizes the simplicity of traditional farming methods, not advanced techniques.
*   **C: Ndị ọrụ ugbo n-enweta ikikere ịkekọrịta ihe oriri n’obodo ha niile:** The passage focuses on self-sufficiency and producing enough for the farmer's household, not necessarily widespread distribution.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that understanding the history of the organization, including both successes and failures, helps people understand the organization's values, mission, and principles. Remembering instances where people acted outside of the norm and achieved positive results makes people more accepting of new changes and directions. The passage also notes that such stories of success reduce fear of change and instill optimism about future changes.

Let's analyze why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ọ dị mkpa ịlota mmemme akaọrụ ndị gara nke ọma**: While the passage mentions remembering successful actions, it emphasizes the broader context of understanding the organization's history and the specific circumstances surrounding those successes.
*   **B: I ga-enweta nghọta ndị omenala metụtara n’otu**: The passage mentions that understanding history is *not* the same as understanding culture, though it helps people see their place in the organization's history.
*   **C: A ga-enyochapụta ụdị ihe na-emelite otu**: The passage focuses on understanding the organization's history, values, and principles."
"N’isonye ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a si dee, kedụ ihe ga-enye aka n’ịnweta nghọta akụkọ ihe mere nke ọnwe?","The correct answer is **C: Ịchọta ebe dị mma n’otu ahụ** (Finding a sense of belonging).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes understanding the organization's history to help people understand where they fit within it:**  The phrase ""...ọ na-enyere ndị mmadụ aka ma enweghi ihe ọzọ ịmatatu ebe ha dabanyere n’ime ihe mere nke ụlọọrụ ahụ"" translates to ""...it helps people understand their place within the company's history."" This directly connects to finding a sense of belonging.
* **Other options are related, but not the central focus:**
    * **A: Ịbelata ụjọ nke mgbanwe** (Reducing the fear of change): The passage mentions that understanding past successes and failures makes people more receptive to change, but the primary goal isn't simply to reduce fear.  It's about understanding the organization.
    * **B: Ịkwalite ihenrita uru** (Promoting profitability): While understanding the organization's history might indirectly benefit profitability, it's not the passage's main focus.
    * **D: Ịmelite omume ọrụ aka** (Improving professional conduct): Again, this could be a byproduct of understanding organizational history, but it's not the core benefit highlighted.

Therefore, the passage suggests that understanding organizational history primarily helps individuals find their place and feel a sense of belonging within the organization. So, **C** is the most accurate answer.

*   The passage emphasizes that there's no single ""best"" way to learn. It argues against a one-size-fits-all approach. ""Agachaaọgwụ"" (silver bullet) implies a guaranteed solution or a universally effective method. The passage explicitly rejects this idea in the context of learning."

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that ""E nweghi otu ụzọ ka mma isi mụta ihe"" (There is no one better way to learn). Option B directly contradicts this statement by suggesting some learning methods should be prioritized over others.

The other options are aligned with the ideas presented in the passage:

*   **B: Ebumuche ya abụghị ịkpọlite gị n’ụra kpamkpam:** The passage explicitly states that wakeful sleep is about consciously waking up after a period of sleep and then falling back asleep, so it is not a total awakening. This statement is accurate.

*   **D: Dịka ịkụlitechara, ebumunuche gị ga-abụ ịlaghachị n’ụra n’oge awa abụọ:** The passage states that the goal is to fall back asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes), not two hours. Thus, this statement is inaccurate."

The passage states that lucid dreams ""increase the time between different REM states."" Therefore, the time *between* REM states increases.
"
Olee n’ime edemed ndịa ga-enwekarị ọnọdụ ọjọọ n’ịkọwapụta nrọ n’ahụ?,"The passage states that lucid dreaming can be tiring because it increases the time between REM cycles, thereby shortening the REM cycles themselves. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Ịwelata ogologo nke oge jịkọtara ọnọdụ REM gasị** (Reducing the length of REM cycles)

Here's why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **B: Ịwelata REM gasị kwa abalị** (Reducing REM cycles per night) - While this *could* be a consequence, the passage specifically emphasizes the shortening of each REM cycle as the primary issue. Decreasing the number of cycles isn't directly stated as the problem.

*   **C: Idakwasị na nkọwaputa nrọ** (Falling asleep while lucid dreaming) - This doesn't directly affect the length or frequency of REM cycles, so it's not the core issue described.

*   **D: Ịmelite REM gasị kwa abalị** (Improving REM cycles per night) - This is the opposite of what the passage describes as a negative consequence.

"Dịka akụkụ akwụkwọ a si dee, kedụ ka timu kọnveshọnal na timu vechụal si yie?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: Timu abụọ na-enye nkọwapụta ọrụ ha na timu njikwa na-adịghị ahụ anya.**

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions the existence of an ""invisible team"" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) which serves as a management team to which individual members report. It also states that the invisible team establishes the standards for each member.

The other options are incorrect because the passage doesn't provide information to support the statement:

*   **A**: ""A na-atụ anya na ha niile ga-arụ ọrụ n’otu ọkwa"": The passage doesn't give us any information on the expected performance of members.
*   **B**: ""Timu abụọ a nwere ọkwa dị iche iche nke pụrụ nwegharị n’ọrụ ha na-arụ kwa ụbọchị"": The passage does not address the level of flexibility.
*   **D**: ""Timu abụọ a na-arụ ọrụ n'otu mpaghara oge"": The passage does not contain any information regarding the time zone these teams work in."
"Idabere n’edemede akwụkwọ a, olee akụkọ gbasara fisikal na vechual timu gasị na-ezighi ezi?","The passage focuses on ""stealth"" or virtual teams and contrasts them with conventional teams. Let's analyze each option based on the text:

*   **A: Ana-emekarị kọnveshọnal timu n’ogo dị elu** - There is no information in this passage in this passage to support or refute the thought of it being highly rated.

*   **B: A na-akpọtụkarị vechual timu tupu kọnveshọnal timu** - The passage doesn't mention the order in which these types of teams are recognized. It is focused on the difference between these two team types.

*   **C: Kọnveshọnal timu nwere obere ikike nnọrọonwe karịa vechual timu** - The passage says, ""Ha na enwekwuru ikike ichoro onwe ha karia ndiotu otu ha na ha dika otu ha nwere ike izute na-ndabere n’oge na-adi iche iche nke obodo ha nwere ike njikwa obodo ha agaghi aghota ya,"" which translates to: ""They have more autonomy than their conventional team counterparts because they can meet independently at different times and places where their community control may not understand it"". This indicates that virtual teams have more autonomy than conventional teams, and this statement is correct, but we need to find the incorrect answer, therefore, this one is not it.

*   **D: Vechual timu ga-erita uru na nwegharị mpaghara oge** - This statement is incorrect because it's the opposite; the passage states ""ndi otu ha na ha dika otu ha nwere ike izute na-ndabere n’oge na-adi iche iche"", which translates to ""they can meet independently at different times"", therefore, virtual teams will not necessarily benefit from time zone changes, and can meet independently on different times instead.

**Therefore, the correct answer is D.**"
Kedu n'ime edemede kọwapụtara ihe echiche ọdịnaya gbadoro ụkwụ n’apụghị ime?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Ọchịchọ ọhụrụ na-achakepụta na mgbe okenye.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that content theories assume people have specific needs/desires that are pre-defined as they grow.
*   Option A, ""New desires emerge in adulthood,"" directly contradicts this assumption. If new desires emerge in adulthood, it means that desires are NOT simply pre-defined from youth.

The other options are either consistent with or supportive of the ideas within content theory:

*   **B: Ka gburugburu mmadụ si elughari nkpatụ ha (""How a person's environment affects them""):** This relates to how the environment influences behavior based on pre-existing needs.
*   **C: Ọchicho dị n'ime obi (""Inner desires""):** This relates to the core concept of content theories, which focuses on what motivates people's desires
*   **D: Ịghọta ihendị na-amasị mmadụ (""Understanding what people like""):** This is the goal of content theories - to understand people's preferences."

Here's why:

*   **The Passage States:** The passage describes the rule of thirds as a compositional tool that creates balance, visual interest, and allows for the placement of the subject in a favorable position by dividing the image into a 3x3 grid.
*   **Other Options:**
    *   A: Ịna-ekepụta ahịrị ntọala nke ebendobe isiokwu - The passage mentions that lines intersect to produce the subject.
    *   C: Ina-edobe isiokwu n'otu ebe dị mma - The passage also mentions subject placement.
    *   D: Ịna-emepụta usoro n'ime foto - The passage mentions the production of balance which is a structure.
*   **Option B Doesn't Align:** While a well-composed photo can *evoke* a sense of life and energy, the rule of thirds itself doesn't directly *create* life and energy. It's a tool for arrangement, not animation."

The passage states that many common formats have the *same* aspect ratio or are close to it, suggesting that the 35mm format is a standard or a reference point, not significantly different in aspect ratio from others.  The other options are explicitly stated in the passage.

"Isonye ka mpaghara akwụkwọ si dee, dịka ndị nrụpụtaihe na-emelitee ogo nke nmeụta enyoanya, olee ka e si kwalite ọdịmma nke enyoanya?","The correct answer is **C: Ụdịdị foto ha dịka enyoanya nwere ogologo fokalụ lemti enwe mgbanwe** (Their image quality is like lenses with a fixed focal length).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""...enyela enyoanya mbugharị ohere iji mepụta fòto nke ịdị mma ya bụ nke yiri nke ahụ enyoanya mezuru n'iji ofu etiti nchakwasa."" This directly translates to zoom lenses now producing photo quality comparable to prime lenses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ha nwere ike enyoanya karịrị dị elu** (They can be more superior lenses) The passage says image quality has become *comparable* to prime lenses, not superior.
*   **B: Ha ka dị mfe iwe rụọ ọrụ n’ọnọdụ ọkụ-dịala** (They are easier to operate in low-light conditions) The passage explicitly states that zoom lenses are *more difficult* to use in low light without a flash because of their lower maximum aperture.
*   **D: Ha nwere fokalụ mgbagwoju anya dị ntakịrị karịa enyoanya purimu** (They have less focal complexity than prime lenses) The passage explicitly states that zoom lenses have *more* focal complexity due to their design."
"Ịdabere n’edemede akwụkwọ a, kedụ mgbe eji achọ enyoanya mgbatiihe karịa enyoanya purimu?","The correct answer is **C: Ma ọbụrụ na ịchọghị iji fụlashi na nhazi gbara ọchịchịrị**.

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Ihe ọghọm ọzọ nke mbugharị ihunyo gasị bụ na oghere nkachasị (èkwòmọsọ ya) nke ihunyo na-adịkarị ala ala. Nke a na-eme ka o sie iji enyo anya dị ọnụ ala eme ihe n'ebe obere ọkụ dị na-ejighi ọkụ flash.""

This directly implies that if you *don't* want to use a flash in low-light situations, you would *prefer* a prime lens (which generally has a wider aperture) over a zoom lens (which generally has a narrower aperture)."

Here's why:

*   The definition of mysticism in the passage states that it emphasizes direct, personal experiences of a divine reality. While many religions might have elements of personal experience, mysticism *insists* on it as a central aspect, differentiating it from other forms of religious belief and worship. Option D says that it is forced onto many types of belief, which is wrong.

The other options are all supported by the passage:

*   **A: A na-enwe mmesi na-ịnweta usoro udo n’obi ụtọ nke amaghị ekere** - The passage describes mystical experiences as potentially leading to ""a state of serenity, insight, bliss, or ecstasy.""
*   **B: Ndịosiso Misticismi na-achọ ịmụta eziokwu nke mmụọ** - The passage states that those who believe seek guidance, inspiration, or understanding of a divine being.
*   **C: Ndịosiso Misticismi nwere ike ịkwere usoro ndị ga-enyere aka ịzụlite nghọta ha n’ụzọ enweghị ntụpọ** - The passage mentions that followers may pursue certain practices or disciplines with the expectation that they will facilitate these experiences."
"Dịka esi dee n’akwụkwọ a, kedụ ihe na-abụghị nlekwasị nke Misitisizim?","The correct answer is **A: Ịna-achọ echicheobi n'ihe enweghị ntụpọ**.

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes personal experience, guidance, inspiration, and understanding within the divine or sacred. It highlights seeking direct experiences with a higher power.

Options B, C, and D all align with these core ideas:

*   B: Ịna-achụso nghọtaobi na nkekọrịta, iheahụrụ mmekọrịta (Pursuing understanding and connection, experiencing relationship) - This aligns with the emphasis on personal connection and seeking guidance.
*   C: Ihe gbasara ọnọdụ iheamaghị dị mma (Positive unconscious states) - The passage mentions the experience of joy, enlightenment, and ecstacy which all are experiences of the unconscious mind.
*   D: Ịna-achụsosi ike ime ịmata Chukwu (Endeavoring to know God) - This is directly related to the passage's description of seeking understanding and relationship with a higher power.

However, option A implies seeking something that is not pure, which is not mentioned in the definition of mysticism above."
"Dika esi dee n’akwụkwọ a, olee onye malitere otu oru ubi?","The correct answer is **D: Maori si na mainlandi**.

Here's why:

The passage states:

*   The original belief was that Maori came from Polynesia and established an agricultural society.

While the passage later challenges aspects of the initial understanding, it doesn't dispute that the Maori (from the mainland) were responsible for establishing agriculture.
"
"Dị ka mpaghara akwụkwọ si kwuo, olee ebe otu ndị chụrụ anụ nta moas na mbụ bi?","The correct answer is **B: Na New Zealandi**.

The passage states that it was believed the first inhabitants of *New Zealand* were the Maori, who hunted moas.
"
Olee otu ịjị usoro Purelandi nke origami rụọ ga abara folda ahụ uru?,"The correct answer is **B: Folda enwela nka moto emelitere**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that Pureland origami was designed to help folders with limited motor skills.** Therefore, by practicing Pureland origami, folders would improve their motor skills.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage says the opposite. Pureland origami restricts folding multiples at once.
*   **C:** The passage does not mention ""foldu azu"" and the restriction is that there is only one fold at a time.
*   **D:** The passage does not mention how many times the folder has attempted the project.

Therefore, the passage supports the claim that Pureland origami improves motor skills.
"
Kedu n'ime ederede ndị a na-akọwapụtaghị origami Purelandi ka ọdị?,"The correct answer is **B: Anaghị agbakwụnye foldu azụ n’usoro ya**.

The passage states the following about Pureland origami:

*   Only one fold can be made at a time.
*   Complex folds are not allowed.
*   All folds must be visually registered.
*   It was created for inexperienced folders or those with limited motor skills.

Option B states that back folds are not added to the process. The passage does not mention anything about reverse or back folds as a rule of Pureland origami. However, the passage mentions that all folds must be visually registered, and that there is a rule against complex folds.

The other options are correct:

*   **A: A na-emebere ya maka ndị folda iheahụrụ**: The passage says it was created for inexperienced folders.
*   **C: Foldu ya ga-enwerịrị ebe amara amara**: The passage states that all folds must be visually registered.
*   **D: Ọ bụ usoro ka mma nke folda gasị nwere ntakịrị nka moto**: The passage says it was designed to help folders with limited motor skills.

Therefore, the statement that does NOT accurately describe Pureland origami is **B**."
"Dika esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee ebe ana-agbakwụnyeghị Civilizeshọn Valie Indusu?","The correct answer is **A: Na Harappa**.

The passage states that the civilization is *named in remembrance* of Harappa, the first site excavated. It does not say the civilization is located *at* Harappa. The other options are explicitly mentioned as areas where the Indus Valley Civilization existed.
"
Kedu nke na-akpọpụtaghị dịka nke nwere ike ịbụ aha maka Mmepeanya nke Afọ Ọla nke e kwuru maka ya n'ederede a?,"The correct answer is **None of the above**. All the options, A, B, C, and D, are mentioned in the text as possible names for the Bronze Age Civilization discussed.
"
"Dị ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a si dee, ole n'ime ederede a na-enye nriteuru ogologo oge?","The correct answer is **A: Mmekọrịta ya na ndị ọzọ**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ ga-achọpụta na ihe kaara ha mma, maka ogologo mgbe, bụ ịrụkọ ọrụ ọnụ"" which translates to ""many people will realize that what is best for them, in the long run, is to work together."" This clearly indicates that cooperation with others yields long-term benefits."
"Dịka akụkụ akwụkwọ ahụ si kwuo, olee n'ime edemede a ka mmadụ nwere ike ibute ụzọ ma ọ bụrụ na ọchọrọ ịnweta nritauru ozugbo?","The correct answer is **D: N’ịchọ ọdịmma nke onwe ya**

Here's why:

* **The prompt (P) states:**  Greed and selfishness will only last so long and if cooperation follows and a majority benefits, that there must be a degree of reward for cooperation, which will then win over selfishness, soon.
* **The Question (Q) is asking:** Which approach leads to short-term rewards as stated in prompt P?
* **Option D says:** N’ịchọ ọdịmma nke onwe ya, which directly translates to ""In self-interest"".

The prompt specifically mentions that selfishness can bring about short term reward. Therefore, option D is the answer.
"
"N’ịsonye ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a si dee, olee onye kpuchiri oke akụkụ nke mmefu agha?","The correct answer is **D: Ndi Filipino**.

The passage explicitly states that the Filipinos were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial government to cover the costs of the American-Philippine War and subsequent governance, meaning they bore the financial burden.
"
Kedu oge bịara tupu afọ nke Templarsi?,"The correct answer is **C: Afọ Etiti Mmalite** (Afọ etiti ndị nke mbụ).

The passage explicitly states that ""Ọgbọ etiti ndị nke mbụ butere ọgbọ etiti ndị dị elu ụzọ,"" and the High Middle Ages is the time period associated with the creation of the Templars.
"
Kedu oge bịara ka afọ nke Templarsi gasịrị?,"The correct answer is **A: Afọ Etiti Ngwụcha**.

The passage states that the High Middle Ages (the time of the Templars) were followed by the Late Middle Ages.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions amputation to protect patients with gangrene.
*   The passage says that they are using morphine and scopolamine, not to treat PTSD (A), but as a way to numb patients for operations and surgeries.
*   It says they used Arterial clamps, to stop the loss of blood (C), it does not mention it was to manipulate blood in any way.
*   The passage mentions they use Scopolamine for operations, not that they use the output to treat it. (B)"
"Dị ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a si kwuo, olee ihe na-abanyeghị n’ọganihu ndị e mere na ngalaba ahụike n'oge Alaeze Ukwu Rom?","The correct answer is **C: Nmepụta nke ụlọ ọgwụ ọmụmụ** (Production of obstetrics hospitals).

The passage mentions:

*   Military campaigns leading to medical corps
*   Doctors being employed by the emperor
*   Surgical advancements (amputations, tourniquets, etc.)

It does **not** mention the development or production of obstetrics (childbirth) hospitals. Therefore, that is the item that does not fit within the advances mentioned in the passage."
Kedụ ihe ikikere ịhụ ihe dakwasiri na?,"The correct answer is **A: Ndị ọgan sensorị sistemụ a na-ahụ anya**.

The passage clearly states ""Ọhụhụ, ma ọ bụ enwemike ịhụ dabere na ọganụ ahụ kesensọ sistemụ ọhụhụ ma ọ bụ anya.""  This directly translates to ""Vision, or the ability to see, depends on the organs and sensory system of sight or eyes.""

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Ihe ndị a chọrọ n’oganizimụ** (The needs of the organism): While an organism's needs might influence the type of eye it develops over evolutionary time, the *current* ability to see directly depends on the sensory system.
*   **C: N’ihi nkpatụ aka nke ụfọdụ wevu-lemti** (Due to the influence of some web-lemti): This option doesn't relate to the passage.
*   **D: Ogo dị nwegharị nke acuiti** (The varying degree of acuity): Acuity (sharpness of vision) is *a result* of the sensory system, not the reason for the ability to see itself.

Therefore, option A is the most direct and accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
Kedu ihe varieshọn nke nhazi anya dị n'etiti ọganizimụ dabere na ya?,"The best answer is **B: Ihe organism chọrọ**.

The passage states: ""E nwere ọtụtụ ọrụrụ nke anya dị iche iche, sitere na ọdịdị nke dabere na ọcịchọ nke ihe ahụ dị ndụ."" This directly links the variation in eye structure to the needs of the organism.

"Ịsonye ka edemede a si dee, olee n’ime okwu ndịa ka anabatara dịka isi ihe nke sistemụ nkwenye Sikh?","The correct answer is **A: Ebumunobi nke guru**

This clearly emphasizes the importance of the guru in Sikh beliefs.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Omenala Hindu gasị:** While the passage mentions Sikhism originating from a division within Hindu traditions, it doesn't say that adherence to Hindu traditions is central to Sikhism.
*   **C: Ekwenyeghị nnabata okpukperechi India ndị ọzọ:** The passage doesn't mention any intolerance for other Indian religions.
*   **D: Ịsụ asụsụ Punjabi:** While the passage mentions Punjabi, it does not state that being a Punjabi speaker is a core tenet of the Sikh faith."
"Dị ka akụkụ akwụkwọ a si kọwaa, olee ihe nwere ike siri ụmụaka nwere nsogbu nkpachapụrụanya ike nweta?","The correct answer is **A: Ọrụ ụlọ akwụkwọ**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ụmụaka n'arịa ọrịa ADD na-enwe nramahụ ịgbado anya n'ihe dịka ọrụ ụlọakwụkwọ..."". This means children with ADD struggle to focus on schoolwork.

This directly translates to children often get into trouble because they ""engage in risky behavior, fight, and challenge authority"" as they seek to stimulate their brains, since they cannot do it naturally.

The key characteristic is providing temporary support to enable learning.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Nkuzi mmụta na mbido egwuregwu kọmputa (Tutorial for a new computer game):** This *is* an example of scaffolding. Tutorials provide step-by-step guidance to help users learn how to play the game.
*   **B: Onyenkuzi SAT (SAT tutor):** This *is* an example of scaffolding. SAT tutors give support so students will score higher on the SAT.
*   **C: Usoro ọmụmụ nkeonwe (Personal curriculum):** This is NOT an example of scaffolding. This is just a plan or method.
*   **D: Onyenchịkwa obere ligi (Little league coach):** This *is* an example of scaffolding. Coaches provide guidance and support to help players develop their skills.

Therefore, the answer is **C: Usoro ọmụmụ nkeonwe**"

Here's why:

*   The passage directly states that scaffolding is **NOT** a learning method but rather a support to aid new learners. Project-based learning is a method so therefore this statement cannot be assumed

The other options are supported by the text:

*   **A: Sikafoodu nwere ike ime vechual:** The passage uses the example of the ""Clippy"" feature in Microsoft Office as an example of scaffolding, so it is implied that scaffolding can be virtual
*   **B: Ọ bụ ihe enyemaka kama usoro ọmụmụ:** The passage makes this explicit: ""Skafoldin abụghị usoro mmụta kama ọ bụ enyemaka...""
*   **D: A na-eji sikafoodu gasị agbakwụnye nkwado na mbido nke iheahụrụ ọmụmụ:** The passage says scaffolding ""supports new learners,"" implying it's used at the beginning of a learning experience to help them get started."
"Dị ka mpaghara akwụkwọ si dee, olee njimara MySpaci nwere ike ịbara ụmụ akwụkwọ nwere nramahụ ịgụ akwụkwọ uru?","The correct answer is **A: Kọstọmizeshọn**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states that MySpace can be customized to be easy to read, with large or small font sizes as needed. This customization is directly relevant to students with reading difficulties.
*   The pasage also stated that it provides a single web adress. This makes it easire to recall and type by students with difficulties.
*   The passage mentions blogs as part of class pages, but doesn't directly link that to benefiting students with reading difficulties.
*   The other options (number of profiles) are not directly related to helping students with reading difficulties.

Therefore, customization is the key feature of MySpace that the passage highlights as potentially helpful for students with reading challenges.

The passage states that Khrushchev:

*   Sent in tanks to restore order.
*   Agreed to some economic demands.
*   Installed Wladyslaw Gomulka as Prime Minister.

Therefore, options A, B, and D were all part of his response.

The passage mentions the protests were *about* wage cuts, not that Khrushchev improved (melite) the cuts. In fact, implying he did the opposite, he tried to stop protests about them.

So the answer is C: **Melite mbelata ụgwọ ọrụ**."
Olee n’ime ihe ndịa na-akpataghị ọgba aghara na Polandi?,"The correct answer is **D: Nhọpụta nke Wladyslaw Gomulka**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the riots in Poland were due to food shortages and wage cuts. The passage also mentions that eventually, Krushchev put Wladyslaw Gomulka in power as prime minister. So, the appointment of Gomulka happened *after* the unrest started, not before it. Therefore, his appointment was not a cause of the riots.

    *   **Ideology** (Esemokwu gbasara sistemu gasị)
    *   **Rivalry** (Ịmegharị usoro gasị)

The passage does not mention Germany as a point of conflict between the USA and USSR."

Olee ihe enwere ike ịhụ na Platuu Giza?,"The correct answer is **D: Piramidi Ukwu**.

The passage states that the Giza Plateau (or Giza Necropolis) contains several pyramids, with the Great Pyramid being the largest. It also mentions tombs and temples. Therefore, options A and B are also correct. However, the question is asking ""what can be seen on the Giza Plateau,"" and the Great Pyramid is the main defining feature. Additionally, only one of the seven ancient wonders is still standing, so it cannot be that the Giza plateau contains all seven.
"
Olee ihe bụ ọchịchọ obi nke Piramidi Ukwu?,"Azịza ziri ezi bụ **B: Ka o nye Fero nsọpụrụ.**

Nkọwa: Edemede ahụ na-ekwu n'ụzọ doro anya na e wuru Piramidi Ukwu iji sọpụrụ Eze Khufu.
"
Olee onye ma ihe maka onye asọnisti nke mebiri tempulu?,"The correct answer is **C: Strabo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the Ephesians forbade the mention of Herostratus's name.
*   The passage explicitly says that Strabo, a Greek historian, later recorded the name, which is how we know it today.
*   Alexander the Great offered to pay for the reconstruction of the temple.
*   Artemis is the goddess the temple was dedicated to."
Kedụ edemede kọwaraa kpọmkwem gbasara nrụgharị tempụlụ nke Atemis?,"The correct answer is **B: A rụgharị ya oge ọchịchị Alexanda Onyeukwu gachara**.

The passage states that Alexander offered to pay for the reconstruction but was refused. It then says the temple was rebuilt in 323 BCE, *after* Alexander's death.
"
"Dị ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a si dee, kedụ afọ izizi spechie gara ije n’ụkwụ abụọ?","The correct answer is **A: Nde afọ asaa gara aga**

The passage states that ""Sahelanthropus nwere ike ije ije n'ukwu abuo na nde afọ asaa gara aga."" This indicates that Sahelanthropus is the earliest species mentioned in the passage that *might* have walked on two legs. While it's not definitive, it's the earliest date provided.
"
Kedu n'ime spechie ndị a na-ejikarị ụkwụ abụọ aga ije?,"The correct answer is **B: Homo Erektus**

Here's why:

*   **Homo Erectus:** The passage explicitly states that Homo Erectus marked the beginning of humans walking upright and habitually.
*   **Sahelanthropus:** The passage mentions that Sahelanthropus *might* have walked on two legs.
*   **Ọpụrụiche bipedalụ:** Bipedal specialisation means they are specialised to walk with 2 legs but the passage does not mention if this species exists or not.
*   **Australopithecus:** The passage states the Australopithecus didn't walk perfectly upright. They were bipedal but not with the same gait or proficiency as later humans."
Kedu ihe ndị agha mmiri Germanị na-agbalị imepụta n'oge WWII?,"The correct answer is **B: Ịgbochi Britain ịnabata ndị mmadụ na ngwaahịa**
Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the German navy was trying to ""kwụsị mkpọchi ụzọ a"" that the Americans were using to send men and goods to Britain. ""Ịkwụsị mkpọchi ụzọ a"" means to stop Britain from receiving people and goods.
"
"Dabere n’ozi e nyere n’edemede a, olee onye kachasi ịnwe ọganihu n'agha navalụ na mgbe Mgbasa Ozi Nọtụ Atlantiki?","The passage states that the Americans were trying to transport men and goods across the Atlantic to aid Britain, while the German navy, using submarines, was trying to stop them. It also implies that if the Allies had failed, Germany might have defeated Britain. This suggests that the Allies (Britain and America) were ultimately more successful in the naval campaign.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Ndị Britain na ndị Amerika** (The British and the Americans)
"
Kedụ ihe na-adịghị nweta oge ndị Asịrịa mejuputara ịji cavalrị?,"The correct answer is **A: Sadulusu**.

The passage explicitly states ""Emepụtabeghị sadụl mgbe ahụ, ya mere kalvarị Asịrịa busoro agha n'elu azụ ịnyịnya ha."" This means saddles were not available to the Assyrians when they first used cavalry.
"
Kọwaa otu esi alụ ọgụ eji calvari alụ?,"The correct answer is **C: N’azụ inyinya**.

The passage states, ""Kalvarị bu ndi agha na-alụ agha ịnyịnya... ya mere kalvarị Asịrịa busoro agha n'elu azụ ịnyịnya ha."" This directly indicates that the Assyrian cavalry fought on horseback.
"
"Dị ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a si kwuo, olee ebe ị na-agaghị ahụ ọkara citizimu Babilọn?","The correct answer is **D: Ịwebata aja n’ebenchụaja dị n’ime**.

The passage states that only the high priest was allowed into the inner sanctuary of the temple. Therefore, an average Babylonian citizen would not be able to bring offerings to the inner altar. The other options (A, B, and C) describe activities that would have been accessible to the general public within the temple complex.
"
Gịnị n'ime ihe ndị a ka e debere naanị maka ndị nchụaja?,"Azịza ziri ezi bụ **B: Ebenchụaja gasị dị n'ime**.

Nkọwa: N'ime ederede ahụ, a na-ekwu ya n'ụzọ doro anya na ""ulo-uka n’otu n’otu nwere mbara-ezi ulo-uka ma nwekazie ime ebe nchuaja ebe nani onye-isi nchu-aja nwere-ike ibanye"".

"
Kedu oge Eze Tutankhamun kpatara aha ọjọọ?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka-achọpụtachara ili ya**.

The passage states that Tutankhamun only became famous *after* the discovery of his tomb in 1922.
"
Gịnị mere Eze Tutankhamun ji bụrụ eze Ijipt a ma ama?,"The correct answer is **A: Nchọpụta nke ili ya na-enweghị mgbagwoju anya** (The discovery of his undisturbed tomb).

The passage states: ""Ma ka o si dị, nchọpụta ebe olili ya n'afọ 1922 mere ya onye ịrịba ama. Mgbe a na ezu ebe olili mgbe gboo ohi, emetụghị nke a aka."" This directly supports answer A.

Kedu onye Grik a ma ama nke a maara maka ihe ọzọ na-abụghị agụmagụ?,"The correct answer is C: Pythagorus.

The passage mentions Sophocles, Homer, and Aristophanes as literary figures (playwrights and poet). Pythagoras is described as a mathematician.
"
Kedụ ebe ndị ezinụlọ Hibru na-emefukarị ọtụtụ oge ha?,"Based on the passage, the best answer is **C: N'ime yaadị (In the yard)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that women cooked in the open air (yards).
*   It also implies that store fronts were open to the street, meaning much of that activity was essentially ""in the yard"" as well.
* The passage notes the importance of building materials being rock-based due to the high cost of wood, implying outdoor work was much more common.

While other activities also occurred inside the home, the focus of the passage suggests the yard was a central and public space for daily life."
Olee ihe na-adịchaghị oke mkpa maka ezinụlọ Hibru?,"The correct answer is **C: Ụlọ obibi ha (Their homes)**.

The passage states ""Na ekpem-oku nke udidi na mba ndi etiti owuwa-anyanwu, ulo ahu abachaghi uru,"" which translates to ""Due to the harsh climate in the Middle Eastern countries, the house was not very important."" The passage then goes on to describe how many activities were done outside of the house, further supporting the idea that the home itself wasn't as central to family life.
"
Gịnị n'ime ndepụta ndịa na-akọwapụtaghị ọdịiche dị n'etiti obodo Scandinavian gasị?,"The correct answer is **B: Ala (Land)**.

The passage explicitly mentions differences in history, culture, and people among the Scandinavian countries (Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland). It doesn't mention any differences in the land or geography of these countries, only differences in the political entities or entities that control land.
"
Kedụ onye gara na mbụ na Greenlandi kpara ala?,"Azịza ziri ezi bụ **A: Agbụrụ Ezkimo**

"
Kedu otu ga-anabata ejighị oche eri nrị?,"The correct answer is **C: Ụmụ nwoke Rome bara ọgaranya**.

The passage states that the wealthy Romans enjoyed reclining while eating, which implies they did not use chairs.
"
Kedu n'ime okwu ndị a na-abụghị akụkụ nke emume ndị Romu mgbe ochie?,"The correct answer is **D: Efere toki a ṅara n'ọkụ**.

The passage states that the Romans did not have access to foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries. Turkey originated in the Americas, so it would not have been part of ancient Roman cuisine.
"
"Sitena ịdabere n'akụkụ akwụkwọ a, olee ihe ndị apụghị ịnwe mmetụta na-adịgide?","Based on the text, the correct answer is **B: Omenala dị obere (Small civilizations)**.

The text states: ""Ụmụ obere ọdịnala na-apụ n'anya na-ahapụghị ihe akaebe dị mkpa ya mere anaghị ahụta ha dị ka sivilaịzeshọn kwesịrị ekwesị."" This translates to ""Small civilizations disappear without leaving significant evidence, therefore they are not considered proper civilizations."" This directly implies that small civilizations are less likely to have a lasting impact.
"
"Olee ihe na-eso obodo, dika mpaghara akwụkwọ a si dee?","The correct answer is **C: Steeti-obodo**.

The passage states ""Steeti-obodo gasị bụ obu ụzọ nke ụmụ mba."" which translates to ""A city-state is the first step of the nation."" This indicates that city-states precede civilization.
"
Olee edemede maka Drukgyal Dzong na-abụghị eziokwu?,"Azịza ziri ezi bụ **A: A rụrụ ya maka emume mmeri nke ndị agha Tibet-Mongol.**

"
Olee edemede kọwapụtara kpọmkwem ihe ọkụ kpatara na Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **A: Onyonyo Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal bụ naanị ihe fọdụrụnụ.**

The passage states that after the fire, ""sọ ihe onwunwe ole m'ole nke Drukgyal Dzong fọ, ihe dị ka onyonyo Zabdrung Ngawang Namgial.""  This translates to ""only a few relics of Drukgyal Dzong remained, such as the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgial.""  Therefore, the image was all that remained. The passage does *not* specify a cause for the fire.
"
Kedu n'ime nkwuputa ndị a banyere Cambodia bụ eziokwu?,"The correct answer is **D: Ndị Thais bibiri Phnom Penh**

The passage states that the Thais destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772.
"

Kedu ihe ụlọ ọrụ Dutch East India na-emeghị mgbe ha nọ na Taiwan?,"The correct answer is **D: Ha kpachara anya nyefee ọchịchị Quing nchịkwa nke Taiwan**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the Qing dynasty took control of Taiwan in 1683. The Dutch were not involved in this transfer of power, as they were expelled before this happened."
Gịnị ka Nkwekọrịta nke Shimonoseki mepụtara?,"The correct answer is **D: Ikikere Japan nwere karịa Taiwani** (Japan's claim over Taiwan).

The passage explicitly states: ""...ọchịchị Qing ahụ mere mbịanye aka na Nkwekọrịta nke Shimonoseki ahụ, site na nke o jiri nyefee Japan ọbụbụeze nke Taiwan, nke na-achị agwaetiti ahụ ruo 1945."" This directly translates to the Qing Dynasty signing the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, who ruled the island until 1945.
"

Kedu n'ime ndepụtandị a na-akọwapụtaghị kpọmkwem ngala ọdụm?,"The correct answer is **C: Ndị nwoke na nwanyị niile nwere njikọ yiri**. Here's why:

*   **A: Ha na mkpokata nkịta na-akpa otu udị agwa:** This is directly stated in the passage: ""Ezinụlọ Ọdụm na-akpa agwa ka ezinụlọ oke nkịta ọhịa maọbụ nkịta ụlọ""

*   **B: Reshoo nwoke na nwanyị akwụghị ọtọ:** This is implied by the passage stating that prides consist of ""one to three related adult males, along with as many as thirty females and their young."" This indicates an imbalance.

*   **D: Ha niile na-egbu egbu ma na-enwekwa mekọrịta mmadụ:** The passage mentions they are ""a very real threat to anything they hunt"" which implies they are predators, and the passage goes to extensive detail regarding the lions social behavior.

*   **C: Ndị nwoke na nwanyị niile nwere njikọ yiri:** The passage states that females are closely related, forming a large family group. It does *not* say that the males have a similar level of relatedness to all members of the pride. The males are said to be ""related,"" but not necessarily to the females or all the other members.
"
Kedu n'ime ndepụta ndị a na-akọwapụtaghị kpọmkwem agwa ọdụm?,"The correct answer is **D: Agwa ha yiri nke nnukwu nwamba ndị ọzọ**

Here's why:

*   **A: Ha na-emekọrịta nke ukwuu** - A kọwara nke a kpọmkwem n'ahịrị mbụ.
*   **B: Ha na-akpa agwa ka wofu** - A kọwara nke a kpọmkwem, na-eme ntụnyere n'omume ha na nkịta ọhịa/nkịta ụlọ.

Kedụ ụdị anụ ndọgbụ na-erikarị oke bekee?,"The correct answer is **C: Ndị ọkara nha nwamba** (Medium-sized cats).

The passage states: ""N'okpuru ha bụ ụmụ nwamba ha ọkara na-eri anụoriri ha ọkara nke nwere ike isi na oke bekee ruo na ele nakwa mgbada."" This translates to ""Below them are the medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey that can range from rabbits to elands and deer.""
"
Kedụ anụ ndị a edesitara ka Nwamba nta na-achụkarị?,"The correct answer is **A: Rodenti**

The passage states that small cats prey on ""obere ụmụ anụmanụ dị ka ụmụ ahụhụ, oke, ngwere, na nnụnụ,"" which translates to ""small animals such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds."" Rodenti is the category that includes mice. While the passage also mentions rabbits, antelope, and deer, these are specifically mentioned as prey for the larger, medium-sized cats, not the small cats.
"
Kedu n'ime usoro ndị a edesitara abụghị akụkụ usoro ịchụ nta ocelot?,"The correct answer is **C: Ịna-eso anụ ọchọrọ ịgbụ n'abalị**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Ocelots see well at night, but it does **not** mention that they specifically **hunt** at night.

Let's break down the other options:

*   **A: Ịme ka ya na gburugburu ebe ọnọ dị mma (Blending in with their environment)** - The passage explicitly states ""Oselọotụ na agwakọta onwe ha na gburugburu ha iji nwude anụ ha na achụ."" (Ocelots blend in with their environment to catch their prey.)
*   **B: Ịna-eso isi nke anụ ọchọrọ ịgbụ (Following the scent of their prey)** - The passage states ""ndị oke mmụta sayensị cheere na nwamba Oselọt ji isi esochi ma na-achọta anụ ha ga eri, site na ịkpọkwa imi n'ala iji site ebe ha gara."" (Scientists believe Ocelots use their sense of smell to track their prey, sniffing the ground to follow trails.)
*   **D: Ọna-egbukarị naanị anụ dị obere n’nha (Typically only kill animals that are smaller in size)** - The passage says ""Ona amasi Ocelot iri obere umu-anumanu"" (Ocelots like to eat small animals).

"
Kedu nke na-akọwapụtaghị oselọt kpọmkwem?,"The correct answer is **C: Ọganị ha ji anụ isi adịghị ike** (Their sense of smell is weak).

The passage states that ocelots use their sense of smell to track prey (""nwamba Oselọt ji isi esochi ma na-achọta anụ ha ga eri, site na ịkpọkwa imi n'ala iji site ebe ha gara""). Therefore, their sense of smell is strong, not weak. The other options are supported by the text.
"
Olee n'ime ederede ndị a ka na-enweghị ka ike kacahsi ukwu nke agụ?,"The passage mentions that tigers are good at climbing, swimming, running long distances, and jumping as high as a strong human. However, it only discusses the tiger's roar in terms of its sound, not its power. Therefore, the answer is:

A: Ịti mkpu (Roaring)
"
"N’isonye ka mpaghara akwụkwọ si dee, olee ederede kọwara ọdịche n'etiti agụ na ọdụm?","The correct answer is **B: Ka mkpu si ada**.

The text states: ""Ụja agụ adịghị ka mgbọpụta n'uju ụja ọdụm, mana ọ dị nnọọ ka okwu e kwuputara n'iti mkpu."" This directly describes the difference in the sound of their roars.
"
"Dị ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a si kwuo, olee ihe Robert Hooke mere tupu bayolọgisti ndị ọzọ?","The correct answer is **A: Ọ hụtara celu ndị nwụrụ anwụ**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Ya bụ onye mbụ nyochara seelụ nwụrụ anwụ."" (He was the first to observe dead cells).

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   B: O Jiri mikroskopu ele ọganizimu (He looked at an organism with a microscope). While true, the passage emphasizes *what* he saw (dead cells) as his primary contribution.
*   C: Ọ hụtara obere sukwiya (He saw little squares). While he did observe small compartments, the passage emphasizes that he discovered dead cells
*   D: Ọ chọpụtara akụkụ ọrụ dịkasịri kacha nta nke ọganịzịmu (He discovered the smallest functional unit of an organism). The passage states that cells are the smallest functional unit of a living organism. Robert Hooke discovered dead cells, but the passage doesn't say that he discovered cells were the smallest functional unit.
"
Olee ihe ntọala okwu a “celu” pụtara?,"The correct answer is **B: Ụlọ dị obere**

The passage states: ""Seelụ si n'okwu Latịn bụ sela nke pụtara obere ụlọ."" This translates to ""Cell comes from the Latin word cella which means small room.""

Therefore, the answer is B.
"
"Dị ka edemede a si kwuo, olee ihe k’ọtụtụ ụmụ anụmanụ nwegasịrị ike ịme?","The correct answer is **B: Ị megharị emegharị**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Anụmanụ ndị ka n'ọnụ ọgụgụ nwere ike ịga ije."" (Most animals can move.)
*   Options A, C, and D (ị fe efe, ị gwo mmiri, ị gwu ihe) are activities that some animals can do, but the passage does not state that most animals can do these actions."
"Dị ka esi dee n’edemede akwụkwọ a, olee ihe ụfọdụ ụmụ anụmanụ na-enweghị?","The correct answer is **C: Ụbụrụ**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Sọ anụmanụ nwere ụbụrụ ( kama ọbụghị anụmanụ nile; jelifish bụ ọmụma atụ nke a)"". This explicitly says that not all animals have brains.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Celụ** The passage begins by stating that most animals are composed of cells. Therefore, animals do have cells.
*   **B: Ikikere igbari nrị** The passage states that animals eat and digest food. Therefore, animals have the ability to digest food.
*   **D: Ikikere ịrị nri** The passage states that animals eat and digest food. Therefore, animals have the ability to eat food."
Gịnị na-enyere osisi aka n’oge fotosynthesisi?,"The correct answer is **D: Anyanwụ**

The passage states that plants produce their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. Therefore, sunlight is essential for photosynthesis.
"
Olee ihe ndị mmadụ na-ekupu n’ume ma osisi na-ekuru ya?,"The correct answer is **D: Kabọn dioxidi**.

The passage states that trees take in carbon dioxide that humans exhale.

"
Olee n’ime ndesịta ndịa bụ ihe na-emelite site n’ikikere ahụhụ ji apịkọlata nku ha?,"The correct answer is **B: Ịzo oghere (Hiding places)**.

The passage states that the ability to fold wings gives insects ""ọtụtụ ebe izonarị ndị na-eri ha,"" which translates to ""many places to hide from predators.""
"
Olee ihe ana-ekwụghị na ndesịta ka ihe ife efe nke ahụhụ na-agbanwe ọnọdụ ya?,"The correct answer is **B: Oge ndụ (Lifespan)**.

Here's why:

*   The paragraph mentions how the ability to fly helps insects escape predators, find food, and find mates. These relate to:
    *   **A: Ọmụmụ (Reproduction)**: Finding mates is directly related to reproduction.
    *   **C: Mkpokọta ihe oriri (Food gathering)**: Finding food is explicitly mentioned.
    *   **D: Ịrụ ọrụ ka nke ọma (Efficiency)**: Escaping predators and finding food easily contributes to efficiency and survival.

*   The paragraph *doesn't* discuss how flight affects the lifespan of insects.

Therefore, ""Oge ndụ"" is the answer choice that is NOT mentioned in the context of how flight affects insects."
Olee n’ime njirimara ndị a ka a na-abụghị maka dinosaurs?,"The correct answer is **B: Nkuku** (Wings).

The passage states that dinosaurs and birds share the characteristics of walking on two feet, laying eggs, and having curved toes. The reason that many people don't think of birds as dinosaurs is that they have wings and can fly. Therefore, wings are a characteristic that most dinosaurs did not possess.
"
Olee n’ime ndesịta ndịa ka na-anaghị ahụtakarị dịka njirimara nnụnụ na dinosaurs na-ekekọrịta?,"The correct answer is **C: Ikike ịfe efe**.

The passage explicitly states that people don't think of birds as dinosaurs ""n'ihi na ha nwere nku ma nwee ike ife efe"" (because they have wings and can fly). This implies that the ability to fly is a distinguishing characteristic of birds, *not* a shared characteristic with dinosaurs. The other options (laying eggs, walking on two legs, and clawed feet) are mentioned as similarities between birds and dinosaurs.
"
"Dị ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a sị kwu, olee akụkụ osisi cycad nke riceratops nwere ike iri?","The correct answer is **B: Ogwe osisi**.

The passage states: ""Tụraịserotọpsụ nwere ike bụrụ na ọ na-eji ọnụ mpịa ya siri ike atụchasị akwụkwọ osisi tupu o riwe ogwe osisi ahụ.""
"
"Dị ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a sị kwu, kedu n'ime ihe ndị a edesịtara ka Triceratops nwekarịrị ike iri? ","The correct answer is **B: Osisi nwere alaka siri ike**.

The passage states that Triceratops may have eaten cycads, which are described as having ""scaled, tough fronds."" It also mentions that Triceratops might have used its beak to tear off tough vegetation. This suggests an ability to consume plants with tough parts. While the passage mentions animals that eat poisonous plants, this is presented as a counterargument to the idea that Triceratops ate cycads, not as a suggestion that it ate poisonous plants in general.
"
"N’isonye n’ederede n’akwụkwọ a, olee n'ime egwuregwu ndị edesịtara bụ ọkachamara na mpaghara ugwu Italị?","Azịza ziri ezi bụ **C: Sunobọọdịm**.

Ederede a na-ekwu na ""egwuregwu oge oyi kachasị ewu ewu n'ugwu"". N'ime nhọrọ enyere, naanị ""sunobọọdịm"" bụ egwuregwu oge oyi.
"
"N’isonye n’ozi dị n’akwụkwọ a, olee n’ime egwuregwu ndị a nwere mmerị na asọmpi ụwa maka Italị?","The correct answer is **A: Footubọọlụ**.

The passage explicitly mentions that the Italian national football team is one of the most successful in the world and won the 2006 World Cup. The passage doesn't mention world championships for Italy in water polo, basketball, or cycling, so we can't confirm those as correct answers.
"
Olee mmemme emechara ka ụfọdụ akụkụ nke Luxembourg ghọrọ Belgium?,"The correct answer is **B: Revolushọnụ nke Belgian**.

The passage states ""...akụkụ Beljọm ga nke ugbua bụbu akụkụ Lukzembọọgụ n’oge gara aga mana mechaa bụrụ Beljian mgbe e nwere mgbanwe ọchịchị n’ike nke Beljian n'afọ 1830 ga."" This directly links the loss of Luxembourg's territory to the Belgian Revolution.
"
Olee n’ime ihe ndị a edesịtara metụtara nnọpụiche Luxembourg?,"The correct answer is **A: Ọrụ Germany**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Luxembourg's independence was disrupted during World War I and II by German occupation. This directly relates to its neutrality being compromised.
*   Other options are correct but do not match as Luxembourg neutrality:
    *   B: Ịsoro otu European Union is true, but it doesn't necessarily reflect neutrality
    *   C: Revolushọnụ nke Belgian: This relates to the historical loss of territory, not necessarily Luxembourg's neutrality
    *   D: Ịghọ obodo nweere onwe ya. This is also true, but does not necessarily reflect neutrality."
Olee sukwiya kilomita nke ngụkọta mpaghara Turkey nọ na Europe?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**

The passage states: ""nke sụkwịya kilomita 23,764 (sụkwịya maịlụ 9174) anọrọ na Yuropu"" meaning that 23,764 square kilometers of Turkey are in Europe.
"
"N’isonye n’ederede n’akwụkwọ a, olee ogologo maịlị ka Turkey di?","The correct answer is **D: 1000**

The text states: ""Okeala Turkey karịrị kilomita 1600 (1000 mi) n'ogologo na kilomita 800 (500 mi) n'obosara...""
"
Olee ihe e ji asụsụ Latin eme na n'obodo Vatican?,"The correct answer is **A: Emume okpukperechi**.

The passage states that Latin is ""asụkarị Latin n’emume ndị ụka ga"" which translates to ""Latin is often spoken in church ceremonies"".
"
"Na Vatikan Citi, kedu ihe anaghị eji Italian eme?","The correct answer is **C: Emume okpukperechi**.

The passage states that Latin is commonly used in church ceremonies, while Italian is used in legislation and public communication. It also mentions that Italian is spoken daily by many who work in the state.
"
"N’isonye n’ederede n’akwụkwọ a, kedu ihe bụ ihenrịta uru nke ana-enweta na-ịgwakọrịta ụda na kọmpụta dị ike?","The text states: ""A na-edekọkarị egwu n’iji kọmputa ọkaibe iji hazie ma wụrikọta ụda ọnụ."" This directly connects powerful computers and sound mixing to **music**.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Egwu (Music)**
"
"Isonye ka esi dee n’akụkụ akwụkwọ a, olee ebe ọtụtụ ụlọ dị na ya nwere ụlọ mposi a na-afụlọshị afụlọshị?","The correct answer is **A: Na Mohenjọ-daro**.

The passage states that ""Ọ fọrọ obere ka ụlọ niile dị n'obodo Harappa na Mohenjo-daro nwee mpochi mmiri, ya na usoro mkpopu kara aka."" This directly translates to ""Almost all the houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had running water and advanced drainage systems"".
"
Kedu n’ime obodo ndị a ka ana-enweta sistemu nsị dị elu?,"The passage states that the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had advanced drainage systems. Therefore the answer is A.
"
Gịnị n'ime ihe ndị a edesịtara na-eme ka onye sketa tụgharịa?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Akụkụ gbara abụọ dị n'ịhụ sketi (The two grooved edges on the bottom of the skate)**.

The passage explicitly states that the two grooved edges are what allow the skater to grip the ice and turn. The heavier edge touching the ice causes the skater to lean and turn in that direction.
"
"Isonye ka esi dee n’akụkụ akwụkwọ a, olee ndesịta kọwapụtara kpọmkwem oghere dị n’ihu sketi izi ọgbara ọhụrụ?","The correct answer is **A: Ihu gbara abụọ**.

The passage states that modern ice skate blades have ""akụkụ abụọ nke oghere dabara ime dị n'etiti ha"" which translates to ""two sides of a groove running between them"".  ""Ihu gbara abụọ"" (two-sided surface) best describes this.
"
"Isonye ka esi dee n’akụkụ akwụkwọ a, kedụ ihe bụ usoro na-enye atọmụ oghere ịwepụ ike karịrị n’ọkụ?","The correct answer is **D: Kpalitere mgbapụta nke radieshọnụ**.

The passage states: ""Ndị ọkammụta sayensị kpọrọ usoro a """"mkpalite mmepụta radiyeshọnụ"""" maka na ọkụ na-egbuke egbuke na-akpali atọm, nke na-ebute mmepụta ọkụ fotọn, ma ọkụ bụkwa otu ụdị radiyeshọnụ."" This directly identifies ""mkpalite mmepụta radiyeshọnụ"" (stimulated emission of radiation) as the process.
"
Olee ihe na-akpalite atọmụ ịwepụta foton?,"The correct answer is **B: Mkpalite si n’ọkụ na-acha nke ọma**.

The passage states: ""ọkụ na-egbuke egbuke na-akpali atọm, nke na-ebute mmepụta ọkụ fotọn..."" This directly says that bright light stimulates atoms to produce photons.
"
"Isonye ka esi dee n’akụkụ akwụkwọ a, kedụ ihe nwere ike ịme ka ọkụ bọlbụ ọrụ?","The correct answer is **C: Filamenti dị n'ime bọlbụ na-ere ọkụ** (The filament inside the bulb burns out).

The passage explicitly states: ""...filament na ọkụ ahụ mechara gbaa ọkụ ma bọlbụ ọkụ ahụ anaghịzi arụ ọrụ"" which translates to ""...the filament eventually burned out and the light bulb no longer works.""  This makes option C the most directly supported answer.
"
Kedu na ndesịta ndịa bụ ihe nwere ike ịmebi ihe maobụrụna ịkpatụ ya aka oge ịna-agbanwe bọlbụ?,"Azịza ziri ezi bụ **C: Isi bọlbụ**.

"
"Isonye ka esi dee n’akụkụ akwụkwọ a, olee ihe na-eme oge a gbawara nucleus?","The correct answer is **B: A tọhapụrụ ike (Energy is released)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that fission ""reproduces some energy."" Therefore, the main result of nuclear fission is the production of energy.
"
Kedu n’ihe ndịa edesitara na-egosiputa ogologo oge ikpọghachị azụ n’ụwa,"The correct answer is **B: Satiliti**.

The passage explains that satellites receive phone calls and send them back to Earth instantly, enabling long-distance communication. This is the key technology that demonstrates long-distance response time.
"
Olee ihe eji-etinye teliskop na speci?,"The correct answer is **B: Rọketi** and **D: Satelliti karịrị elu 100 fiti**

The passage states ""O na-ewe nnukwu rọketi gafere ụkwụ otu narị n’elu itinye otu satịlaịtị na teliskop n’eluụwa."" which translates to ""It takes a large rocket over a hundred feet tall to put a satellite and telescope into space"".  Therefore a rocket is used and it is over 100 feet tall.
"
Kedu ihe ekwuru maka mmemme sikulikul iji nyochaa ngafe oge?,"The correct answer is **B: Nmeghasị**.

The passage states: ""Ị nwere ike ịka ngafe nkke oge n’onwe gị site n’ileru anya mmegharị ọzọ nke otu emume saịklikalụ."" This translates to: ""You can experience the passage of time yourself by looking at the successive movements of a cyclical event."" Therefore, the passage mentions using ""nmeghasị"" (successive movements/repetitions) of a cyclical event to gauge the passage of time.
"
"Isonye ka esi dee n’akụkụ akwụkwọ a, kedụ ihe eji atụnyere oge n’ihe mmemme?","The correct answer is **A: Ogologo**.

The passage states: ""Oge bụkwa etu anyị si atule oge (ogologo) mmemme gasị."" This directly translates to ""Time is also how we measure the time (length) of events that pass."" Therefore, length is used to compare events in time.
"
"Isonye ka esi dee n’akụkụ akwụkwọ a, olee ihe ekwesiri iji were onye ga-anọ n’oche eze?","The correct answer is **D: Onye gara mahadum tupu ọsonye ndị agha.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Charles went to university and *then* became a soldier. It contradicts the traditional custom of joining the military *after* finishing school.  Therefore, going to university *before* joining the military is the deviation from tradition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Onye nwere digirie 2: 2 (Onye nwere digirie)** While the passage mentions Charles getting a 2:2 degree, this isn't directly related to the change in the traditional order of things. The mere fact he got a degree is what matters.
* **B: Ịhapụ mahadum ịbanye na ndị agha (Leaving university to join the military)** The passage says Charles went to university *and then* joined the military, the opposite of this statement.
* **C: Onye gụrụ akwụkwọ Histiri (Someone who studied History)** The passage does not mention if someone that will be on the throne needs to study History.
"
"Kedụ ihe izizi Charles buru ụzọ mee, sitena ozi dị n’akwụkwọ a?","The correct answer is **D: Ọ gara Triniti Kọleji**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states ""Charles gara mahadum na Trinity College, Cambridge...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: O Soro ndị agha tupu agụchaa akwụkwọ**: The passage states that traditionally, the heir would join the military *after* education, and implies that Charles didn't follow this tradition.
*   **B: Ọ gụrụ akwụkwọ Akịọlọjii**: While Charles did study Archaeology, he also studied Anthropology, so it wasn't the *first* thing mentioned.
*   **C: O nwere digirie**: The passage states he *received* a degree, implying that going to Trinity College happened before."
Kedu obodo ụgbọ mmiri Trygvasson si?,"The correct answer is **D: Norway**.

The passage states: ""Onye isi agha a bụ Olaf Trygvasson, onye obodo Nọọwe..."" which means Olaf Trygvasson, the leader of the naval force, was from Norway.
"
Kedụ mgbe Germani welitere omenala dị ike na Estonia?,"Azịza ziri ezi bụ **B: Ihe dị ka afọ 400 gara aga**.

Akụkụ ahụ kwuru na mmetụta omenala German dị ike na Northern Estonia mere ""N'ihe dị ka narị afọ nke iri na ise,"" nke bụ ihe dị ka afọ 400 gara aga site taa.
"
Olee ihe metụtara asụsụ ndị Estonia?,"The correct answer is **B: Mkpụrụedemede German**.

The passage explicitly states that the Estonian Literal language was created using the German alphabet as a basis.
"
"Isonye ka esi dee n’akwụkwọ a, olee ihe na-akpata ọnụọgụ ndị na-asụ Hindi?","The correct answer is **A: Ma ọbụrụ na agụọ olumba dịka Hindi**

The passage states: ""Onu ogugu nwaafọ ndị na-asụ asusu ahụ dịgasị iche na-ndabere na ma ọ bụrụ na aguru ma olumba ndị nwere mmetụta chiri anya."" This directly supports option A.
"
Olee ndesita bụ eziokwu gbasara asụsụ Hindi na Urdu?,"The correct answer is **B: Sikripti ha dị iche iche (Their scripts are different)**.

The passage states: ""Hindi na Urdu yitere na okwu ma ha di iche n’odide (Hindi and Urdu are similar in vocabulary but different in script).""
"
Olee ndesita nke na-abụghị okwu ziri ezi banyere mkpụrụedemede Hangeul?,"The correct answer is **A: E bidoro ya n’oge mbido ọchịchị Eze Sejong**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Hangeul was created in 1444, during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450). 1444 is near the middle-to-end of his reign, not the beginning.
*   The passage specifically mentions the name Hunmin Jeongeum so B is correct.
*   The passage states that he was the 4th king of the Joseon Dynasty, so C is correct.
*   The passage also states that Hangeul was deliberately designed.

"
Kedụ ihe nọchitereanya mkpụrụedemede Hunmin Jeongeumu?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

The passage states: ""Na mbụ ọ gụrụ akara edemede Hangeul, Hunmin Jeongeum..."" which means that the Hangeul alphabet was originally called Hunmin Jeongeum.
"
Olee asụsụ Sanskrit metụtara dika esi dee n’akwụkwọ a?,"The correct answer is **D: Asụsụ India**

The passage explicitly states that Sanskrit is the source of many modern Indian languages.
"
"Dị ka esi dee n’akụkụ akwụkwọ a, gịnị welatara iji Sanskrit arụ ọrụ?","The correct answer is **D: Ọkwa**.

The passage states: ""Mgbe a chịkọtachara Upanishads, asụsụ ndị ọzọ ewere ọnọdụ sanskrit."" This implies that Sanskrit lost its prominence after the Upanishads were compiled, meaning it was replaced, its position or ""ọkwa"" was taken over by other languages.
"
"Ị dabere ka akụkọ akwụkwọ a si kwuo, kedụ n’ime ndesịta ndịa kwụrụ kpọmkem ihe gbasara gụraviti na Io?","The correct answer is **D: Gụraviti ụwa ga-akpụtarị ihe na gị karịa gụraviti Io**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that you would weigh less on Io than on Earth. This means Earth's gravity pulls on you with more force than Io's gravity does."
"Ị dabere ka akụkọ akwụkwọ a si kwuo, kedụ ederede kọwara kpọmkwem leya npụta ọnwa?","The correct answer is **A: Ihemkpuchi siri ike dị n’akụkụ nso ya**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""E nwere ike nwekwuo marịa ọzọ n'akụkụ ya dị nso n'ihi na krọstụ ya kara taa ahụ."" This directly supports that the crust is thinner on the near side (akụkụ ya dị nso). ""Kara taa ahụ"" translates to ""is thinner."" Therefore, the crust on the near side is thinner."
"Isonyere ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, kedụ ebe ihenkpuchi Ọnwa kachasi ike?","The correct answer is **C: N'okpuru ala dị elu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Crọstụ ahụ dị ihe dị ka km70 n'ịgba agba n'akụkụ ya dị nso na km100 n'ịgba ịgba n'akụkụ ya tere anya. Ọ kara taa ahụ n'okpuru marịa ma kara gbaa agba n'okpuru ụmụ ala ugwu ugwu ahụ.""
*   This translates to: ""The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side. It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.""
*   Therefore, the crust is thickest (or strongest) under the highlands (""ụmụ ala ugwu ugwu"")."
"Isonyere ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee akụkọ n'ime nkwuputa a gasị ụfọdụ ndị mmadụ nabatara?","The correct answer is **C: Pụlaneti ndị ọzọ nwere ndụ na ha**.

The passage states that ""ufodu kwetere na ndi obia ma obu ndu ozo nwere ike ibi na uwa ndi ozo"" which translates to ""some believe that aliens or other life may live on other worlds."" This directly supports option C.
"
Kedu ihe na-epekarị mpe maọbụrụna ịna-agata etiti Anyanwụ aka?,"The correct answer is **C: Gasị**.

The passage states: ""Gaasị ahụ ga-adị gịrịgịrị ka ị ga-aga site n’etiti anyanwụ."" This directly indicates that gas becomes increasingly dense as you move towards the center of the sun.
"
"Ịsonyere ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, kedụ mpaghara anyanwụ ka a na-ahụta anya site n’Ụwa?","The correct answer is **C: Ọ bụ Fotosfee**.

The passage states: ""Mpaghara mputa nkea anyi ahu ma anyi lee Anyanwụ anya ka ana akpo photospere, nke putara """"bọọlụ nke ọkụ""""."" This directly translates to: ""The outer region we see when we look at the Sun is called the photosphere, which means ""sphere of light"".""
"
Kedu n'ime nchọpụta ndị a edeputara nyere aka kwado ozizi Copernicus?,"The correct answer is A:

The passage states, ""Usoro feezi nke Venus kwadoro tiori nke Copernicus na ụmụ mbara ala na-agba Anyanwụ gburugburu."" This translates to ""The phases of Venus supported Copernicus' theory that planets orbit the Sun.""
"
Gini ka Galileo Galilei chọpụtara na 1610?,"The correct answer is **B: Akụkụ nke Venusu (Parts of Venus)**.

The passage states that Galileo Galilei, in 1610, observed that Venus has phases like the moon.
"
"N’isonyere ederede akwụkwọ a, olee ebe Osimiri Amazọnụ si enwebata mmiri?","The correct answer is **A: Osimiri ndị dịgasị nta**.

The text states: ""Ọ na-ewetaju mmiri site n’ọtụtụ puku osimiri ndị kara di obere."" This translates to ""It receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.""
"
Olee akụkọ otito anaghị enye Osimiri Amazọnụ?,"Azịza ziri ezi bụ **C: Ọ bụ osimiri kachasị ogologo**.

Ebe a bụ ihe kpatara ya:

*   Ọ kwuru na ọ bụ osimiri kachasị ukwuu, ma kọwaa ogologo ya, na ebe obosara ya."
Olee ụdị ọrụ edesitara n’ederede a na-eji ọnụ ọgụgụ ndị Venezuelan dị obere arụ ọrụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Mmanụ**.

The text states: ""...ọ bụ naanị otu pasentị na-arụ n'ụlọọrụ mmanụ."" This directly indicates a small percentage of Venezuelans work in the oil industry.
"
"N’isonye ka ederede a si kwuo, olee mpaghara na-ejikari ji ọnụ ọgụgụ Venezuelan buru ibu arụ ọrụ?","The text states that ""two-thirds of working Venezuelans do so in the service sector."" This is the largest proportion compared to agriculture (one-fifth) and manufacturing (almost one-fourth). The oil sector only employs one percent.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Ịrụ ọrụ** (Service sector)
"
"Isonyere ka esi de n’akwukwọ a, olee ihe fushọnụ na-ekwe ka kpakpando mee?","The correct answer is **C: Ọ na-enyefu ọkụ na okpomọkụ** (It gives off light and heat).

The passage states that stars give off light and heat from the energy released when hydrogen atoms fuse to form heavier elements.  This directly answers the question.
"
Gịnị n’ihe ndị edesitara ka ezigbo riaktọ fushọnụ ga-ekeputa?,"Azịza ziri ezi bụ **D: Ike**.

Nkọwa:
*   P paragraf kwuru na kpakpando na-emepụta ike site na njikọ nke atomụ haịdrojin.
*   Ihe ndị ọkà mmụta sayensị na-agbalịsi ike ịmepụta bụ ígwè ọrụ na-eṅomi nke ahụ, ya bụ, otu ụdị ígwè ọrụ ga-emepụta ike."
Olee kemikụl mejupụtara mmiri?,"The correct answer is **D: Atọmụ Hayịdụrogen abụọ na otu ikuku oxygen**.

The passage states ""Atọm haịdrojin abụọ na otu atọm ọksigin bụ ihe mebere mmiri.""  Option D is the closest translation of this, even though it says ""ikuku oxygen"" (which translates to ""oxygen atom""). While the passage is in Igbo, the question asks about the *chemical composition* of water, which is always two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
"
"Oge mmiri gbanwere ụdị, olee ihe na-anọgide ka ọdị na mbụ?","The correct answer is **A: Ọdịdị molekụla**.

The passage emphasizes that the chemical composition of a substance (like water) remains the same regardless of its physical state (solid, liquid, or gas). This chemical composition is determined by the structure of its molecules. While properties like density and appearance change, the underlying arrangement of atoms within the molecule remains constant.
"
"Isonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee na ndesịta ndịa na-abụghị nramahụ nke steeti iri na atọ nyere ha ịkwanye ụfọdụ iwu?","The passage describes several weaknesses of the government under the Articles of Confederation. Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: Nleharanya dị ukwu si n’ọchịchị steeti (Great disrespect from state government):** The passage explicitly states that the states often disagreed with and did not comply with the laws passed by the Confederation Congress. This is a major sign of disrespect.
*   **B: Enweghị ike n'etiti Kọngụresi (Lack of power in Congress):** The passage says Congress could not levy taxes, had no executive or judicial branch to enforce laws, and relied on states to support its laws. This shows a clear lack of power.
*   **C: Ndozigharị na-achọghị nkwado mmadụ (Amendments that do not require human approval):** This translation is unclear. It seems the answer is referring to the difficulty of amending the Articles of Confederation because it required unanimous consent from all states, making any change nearly impossible.
*   **D: Obodo enweghị onyeisi ọchịchị (The state has no president):** This answer is actually true. The passage implies the federal government had no executive branch.

All options highlight weaknesses of the government under the Articles of Confederation as described in the passage. But, since the question asks which answer best fits the description of the power given to the 13 states, it must be one that highlights the power of the states.

Answer choices B, C, and D are all problems for the federal government, but answer choice A highlights how the states did not listen to the federal government. So the answer is:

**A: Nleharanya dị ukwu si n’ọchịchị steeti**"
"Isonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee nkwupụta na-eziputa kpọmkwem steeti gọọmentị etiti na mgbe Agha Mgbanwe?","The correct answer is **C: Ndị nnọchi anya steeti abịaghị n’ọgbakọ**

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states: ""...steeti ga weere gọọmentị etiti n'ihe efu ruo na ndị nnọchiteanya ha anaghị abịa.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndị Kọngụresi na ndị ọchịchị steeti manyere ndị mmadụ ịkwụ ụtụ gasị** The passage states that the Congress was powerless to tax.
*   **B: Kọngụresi nyere ikikere ịdezigharị edemede ahụ** The passage states that edits to the Articles required unanimous agreement from the states.
*   **D: Ọchịchị etiti nwere isi akụkụ abụọ** The passage states the government only had the legislative branch."
Olee etu esi ede okwu gasị dị n'azụ Agbamụama nke Nwereonwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Mkpọdo isi ala**.

The passage states: ""Ederede ahu putara na ala-ala akwukwo ahu, kpodo isi na-ala."" This translates to ""The writing appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.""
"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a edesịtara ka eji mara Singapore?,"Based on the provided information, the correct answer is:

**A: Akwụkwọ osisi obodo mepere emepe**

The passage explicitly mentions the transformation of Singapore into a ""Garden City of the tropics,"" highlighting the importance of its botanical expertise and its association with plant life. The other options are not directly supported by the given text.
"
Kedu ihe bụ Vanda Miss Joaquim?,"The correct answer is **B: Fụlawa** (Flower).

The passage states that Vanda Miss Joaquim is a ""ngwakọ ifuru,"" which translates to ""hybrid flower.""
"
Olee ụdịdị pyramidi Giza ka Alaeze Ọhụrụ Ijipt enweghị ike ịnabata dịka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a?,"The correct answer is **C: Nha ha (Their size)**.

The passage states that the pyramids of Giza surpassed all others in ""nha ha na ima mma nka na ụzụ nke ọrụrụ ha"" (their size and the technical artistry of their construction). This means the New Kingdom Egyptians were specifically in awe of their size.

This implies that establishing military outposts or bases (Ụlọọgwụ ndị agha) in these captured African territories was a key part of their strategy to project power into Africa.
*   D: ""Ịbibi ntọala ndị Britain"" is also mentioned in the passage as something they did, but establishing military outposts in Africa is the strategy that made them able to travel across the Mediterenian.

"
"Dị ka akụkụ akwụkwọ a si dee, kedu ihe bụ isi ebumnobi Itali n'agha a?","The correct answer is **A: Ị wakpo obodo Afrika gasị (To conquer African countries).**

"
"Ònye rụrụ abụ nsọpụrụ ofufe n’oge e ji achụ àjà ihe oriri, dị ka e si kwuo ya?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

The passage states: ""Lakkha Singh gosirikwara chhappan bhog bhajan,"" which translates to ""Lakkha Singh also performed the chhappan bhog bhajan."" This directly indicates he performed the devotional song during the offering of the 56 food items.
"
Kedụ ihe bụ ikeọrụ ikpeazụ-abụọ nke mgbede?,"The passage states:

*   ""Na ngwụcha, ndị otu igba egwu nke Tọki gosiri ihe ngosi """"Troị""""."" (At the end, the Turkish dance troupe showed the performance """"Troy"""")
*   ""Onye Tọki diva Sezen Aksu mere emume ngosi ya na onye Itali ahụ tenor Alessandro Safina na ọgụ egwu onye Griik Haris Alexiou."" (Turkish diva Sezen Aksu performed with Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou.)

Therefore, the last two performances were Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina and Haris Alexiou, and then the Turkish dance troupe's show ""Troy.""

Since the question asks for the ""ikpeazụ-abụọ"" (last-two) performances, the correct answer is the Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina and Haris Alexiou.

So the answer is: A"
Kedu obodo Alessandro Safina si?,"The correct answer is **D: Ịtalian**.

The passage states ""Onye Tọki diva Sezen Aksu mere emume ngosi ya na onye Itali ahụ tenor Alessandro Safina..."" which clearly indicates Alessandro Safina is Italian.
"
"Ị kwenye na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee n’ime ederede ndịa na-abụghị okwu ziri ezi?","Let's analyze each option based on the provided text:

*   **A: E nwere ọkụ ọgbụgba na Santa Clara:** The passage refers to Fire Chief Scott Kouns, implying the presence of a fire department, but not necessarily an active fire incident. The core issue is the roller coaster malfunction.

*   **B: Ọ gbachidoro ndị mmadụ na kosta rola:** The text states that riders were ""stuck"" on the roller coaster. This confirms option B.

*   **C: Enyere ndị njem mmiri ka ha ṅụọ:** The text only mentions that riders were helped and that they were stuck under the sun for more than an hour. There is no mention of the riders being given water to drink.

*   **D: O were opekatampe nkeji 60 iji kpọpụta onye izizi n’ụgbọ:** The passage explicitly says ""it took at least an hour to get the first person off the ride,"" which is the same as 60 minutes.

Therefore, the statement that is NOT a true detail from the passage is:

**C: Enyere ndị njem mmiri ka ha ṅụọ**"
"Isonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee onye kwụrụ ụka gbasara ọkwa ekpomoku ọjọọ ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: onye isi mgbanyụ ọkụ**.

The passage states, ""Onyeisi ọkụ Scott Kouns kwuru..."" followed by the quote discussing the uncomfortable heat. Therefore, the fire chief is the one who commented on the heat level.
"
Ebee ka mfu ike metụtara tsunami mere?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

The passage states: ""O nweghị nnukwu mmebi ma ọ bụ mmerụ ahụ akọrọna n’ime Tonga, mana e were ọkụ nwa oge, nke a kọrọ gbochiri ndị ọchịchị Tongan ịnata ịdọ aka na ntị maka ajọ ebili mmiri PTWC ahụ nyere.""
"
"Mmetụta dị aṅaa ka nkwụsị ọkụ ahụ nwere na Tonga, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **D: Enyeghị ndị ọchịchị ịdọ aka ná ntị ndị dị mkpa**.

The passage states, ""...a brief power outage, reportedly prevented Tongan authorities from receiving a tsunami warning issued by the PTWC."" This means the power outage hindered the authorities from receiving the important warning.
"
Kedu mgbe ndị uwe ojii nwere ike iji akụrụngwa radar ha tụọ ọsọ ịnya ụgbọ ala Jonny Reid?,"The correct answer is **A: Na 160 km / h, ọ na-eme njem**.

The passage states ""...na naanị oge ndị uwe ojii gbalịrị ma nweta Maazị Reid bụ mgbe jiri nwayọọ ruo km/a160."" This means the *only* time they could get a reading was when he slowed down to 160 km/h.
"
Kedu ihe mere na onye mgbanye ọlaedo Olympic anọghị na-aṅụ ọgwụ maka ahụ mgbu ya?,"The correct answer is **A: Ịkwọ ụgbọ ala na ọsọ n'okpuru 160 km / h**.

The passage states that the police had trouble tracking Mr. Reid's speed until he slowed down to 160 km/h. This implies that he was driving *faster* than 160 km/h for most of the time, making ""driving under 160 km/h"" the reason they could finally track him.  The question asks why the police had difficulty tracking him *before* he slowed down.
"
Kedu ebe dị anya site na Butte bụ etiti ala ọma jijiji ahụ?,"The correct answer is **D: n'ebe ugwu 65 kilomita**.

The passage states: ""Ala ọma jijiji ahụ nwere etiti ya na ihe dị ka km 65 (maịlị 40) ndịda nke Butte.""  This clearly indicates the epicenter was about 65 km *south* of Butte. My apologies; after checking the original text, the distance is *south* of Butte not *north* of Butte.
"
Kedu ihe mere na ọgba aghara Abu Ghraib?,"The correct answer is **A: mmeso ọjọọ nke ndị mkpọrọ** (mistreatment of prisoners).

The passage states that Abu Ghraib prison became infamous because of the abuse of prisoners discovered there after US forces took control. While the fire (D) is mentioned, it was during a riot. The main reason it's well-known is the prisoner abuse. Options B and C are not the causes of the scandal.
"
Gịnị mere e ji mara ụlọ mkpọrọ Iraq nke ọma? ,"The correct answer is **D: ịchọta ihe akaebe nke mmetọ ndị mkpọrọ** (finding evidence of prisoner abuse).

The passage explicitly states that Abu Ghraib prison became notorious after the discovery of prisoner abuse by US soldiers. The other options are mentioned, but the core reason for its notoriety is the abuse.
"
Olee ụdị ememme e mere ndokwa ka e mee n’ámá egwuregwu Ncheta Agha Maui?,"The correct answer is **C: ngosi** (concert).

The passage mentions ""the band"" and ""HK Management Inc., the band's management company,"" implying the event was a concert.
"
Ònye mechara nye nkwado maka ịkagbu mmemme ahụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Ụlọ ọrụ na-arụ ọrụ**

The passage states that ""Ụlọ ọrụ nlekọta òtù nkwa egwu ahụ, bụ HK Management Inc., enyeghị nkọwa nke izizi mgbe ha kagburu na Septemba 20, mana ha boro ya ihe mkpata lọjistik mgbe chi foro.""  HK Management Inc. is the ""ụlọ ọrụ na-arụ ọrụ""."
Kedu onye ụfọdụ ụmụ amaala Bishkek kwenyere na ọ bụ ya kpatara ịkwakọrọ ihe?,"The correct answer is **C: Ndị na-eme ngagharị iwe**.

The passage states: ""Otutu ndi bi na Bishkek tara ndi na-eme ngaghari iwe si na odida anyanwu uta gbasara imebi iwu"" which translates to ""Many Bishkek residents blamed protesters from the west for the looting"".
"
Kedu onye kenyere ndị ngagharị iwe maka izu ohi ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ụmụ amaala Bishkek**.

The passage states that ""Otutu ndi bi na Bishkek tara ndi na-eme ngaghari iwe si na odida anyanwu uta gbasara imebi iwu"" which translates to ""Many residents of Bishkek blamed the protesters from the west for the lawlessness."" This indicates that the residents of Bishkek are the ones assigning blame for the looting.
"
Kedu mgbe Ring hụrụ ịrị elu na azụmaahịa?,"The correct answer is **A: Na-esote arụmọrụ na Shark Tank** (Following an appearance on Shark Tank).

The passage states: ""Siminoff sị na orire ahịa gbaliri elu ka ogosichara n'ihe nkiri Shak Tank n'afọ 2013..."" (Siminoff said that sales skyrocketed after appearing on the show Shark Tank in 2013...). This directly supports option A.
"
Kedu mgbe Jamie Simoff mere mkpebi ịmalite Ring?,"The correct answer is **A: chọpụtara mgbịrịgba ọnụ ụzọ nke ya anaghị ada ụda nke ukwuu**.

The passage states that Jamie Siminoff started his company Ring after he couldn't hear his doorbell in his garage workshop. This is directly related to option A. The other options are events that happened later in the company's history, after he had already started it.
"
Kedu ihe e nyere ụmụaka na mmemme Ọgụgụ Rainbow ọ bụla?,"The correct answer is **D: Akwụkwọ**.

The passage states: ""Ihe ngosi ọbụla gakwa enye ụmụ nkwanye maka akwụkwọ ndị nke ụmụaka kwesịrị ịchọ maka mgbe ha gara n’ọbaakwụkwọ ha."" This translates to ""Each show would also give children recommendations for books that children should look for when they went to their library.""
"
Gịnị kpatara na a kagbuola usoro ihe onyonyo nke Reading Rainbow?,"The passage states ""some, including John Grant, believed that budget cuts and a shift in educational programming philosophies contributed to the show's cancellation."" So the answer is **A: ezughị oke akụrụngwa** (insufficient funds, which is a result of budget cuts).
"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị ihe nchebe nke ndị nnọchiteanya Amsterdam na ụlọ ihe ngosi nka nyere banyere osisi ahụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Ekwesịrị idowe ya**.

The passage states that the officials argued the tree should be cut down because it was diseased, posed a public health risk, and was in danger of falling. Option B is the opposite of their argument.
"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a kwesịrị ịga nyocha oge niile, dịka onye nleba anya kacha elu nke RSPCA siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **B: Onye ọ bụla na-eji anụmanụ eme ihe**.

While the passage mentions CCTV cameras in slaughterhouses, the overall message is about monitoring and inspecting the treatment of animals. The quote from David O'Shannessy emphasizes that ""inspection of abattoirs"" should be constant. Option B, ""Onye ọ bụla na-eji anụmanụ eme ihe""  best reflects this broader need for oversight of those who handle animals, particularly in the context of slaughterhouses.
"
"Kedu ihe ga-enyere ndị na-arụ ọrụ n'ụlọ anụ ụlọ n'Australia aka ịghọta uru nlekọta anụ ụlọ dị, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **A: Nhazi nke igwefoto CCTV**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the RSPCA is calling for the installation of CCTV cameras in all Australian abattoirs.
*   The purpose, according to RSPCA, is to signal to meat producers that animal welfare is a top priority. This implies that the presence of CCTV cameras and the potential for scrutiny will encourage better treatment of animals, thus helping workers understand the importance of animal welfare.
*   The installation of CCTV cameras would help the meatpacking workers in Australia recognize the value of animal care, as the passage suggests.
"
"Gịnị ka onye ahụ e jidere na-eme, dị ka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: onye mmụta**

The passage states ""ejidere nwa akwụkwọ ọzọ maka okwu gbasara mgbagbu mere n'ụlọ akwụkwọ..."" which means the person arrested is a student.
"
"A na-eme olili ozu mmadụ ole, dị ka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ ahụ si kwuo, mgbe akụkọ gbasara njide ọzọ gbasara?","The correct answer is **D: Anọ**

The passage states: ""Akụkọ gbasara n'ime obodo Red Lek taa dịka a na eme olili ozu Jeff Weise na mmadụ atọ ọzọ n'ime mmadụ itolu ndị ihe mmerede metụtara..."". This means the funeral was for Jeff Weise *and* three other people, making a total of four.

"
Kedu mba ahọrọghị imejuputa nkwekọrịta ACTA ha bịanyere aka na nzaghachi maka ngagharị iwe ahụ?,"The correct answer is **D: Latvia**.

The passage states that ""Ma Latvia ma Slovakia egbuola oge nke usoro isonyere ACTA,"" indicating they delayed the process of joining ACTA in response to the protests. The other options are not explicitly mentioned as having delayed or withdrawn from ACTA."
Ole ihe omume nke ikpo oke ọkụ iPod butere mmerụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **C: 6**.

The passage states: ""E kwuputala na na e nweela nsogbu 60 sitere na iPods ndị n'anaghị arụ ọrụ nke ọma na-ekwo oke ọkụ, nke na-ebutala ọkụ ọgbụgba isii merụrụ ndị mmadụ ahụ obere."" This directly indicates that six overheating incidents resulted in minor injuries.
"
Ònye kwuru na ikpe ekpo oke ọkụ adịghị mkpa n'ezie?,"The correct answer is **D: Apple**.

The passage states: ""N'izuka gara aga, METI mara okwa sị na Apple gwara ya gbasara oke ekpomoku iri atọ na anọ merenụ, nke ụlọ ọrụ kpọrọ """"ihe na-abụghị ihe.""""""  This translates to: ""Last week, METI announced that Apple informed them about thirty-four overheating incidents, which the company called """"not something.""""

Therefore, Apple is the one who characterized the overheating incidents as ""not something"".
"
"N'okwu ya, Steve Jobs kwuru na Apple ga-agbanwe gịnị?","Azịza ziri ezi bụ **B: Ekwentị mkpanaaka**

N'okwu ya, Steve Jobs kwuru, ""Taa Apple ga-agbanwe ekwentị dị ka ụwa si mara ya..."" nke pụtara na Apple ga-agbanwe ekwentị mkpanaaka.
"
Gịnị mere Steve Jobs ji kwuo okwu were awa abụọ?,"The correct answer is **C: Na-ewepụta ekwentị ọhụrụ**.

The passage states that Steve Jobs announced the iPhone during his speech. The other options aren't related to the context.
"
"N'ụlọ ihe nkiri Argentine, gịnị ka Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner kwupụtara?","The correct answer is **A: Ọkwa ya maka ịzọ ọkwa onyeisiala**.

The passage clearly states that Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced in La Plata that she would be running for president of Argentina.
"
Kedu ebe Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner kwuputara ọkwa ya?,"The correct answer is **D: Na Buenos Aires, na ụlọ ihe nkiri La Plata**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner mara ọkwa na mgbede ụnyahụ na La Plata, obodo nọpụrụ kilomita 50 (maịlụ 31)site na Buenos Aires..."" meaning La Plata is near Buenos Aires
*   The passage also states: ""Ọ bụ n'Ajentaịn Tiyeta ka Lọọlọ Kirchner kwuputara ebumnuche ya..."" meaning she announced it in the Argentina Theater
*   Putting these facts together the answer would be ""Na Buenos Aires, na ụlọ ihe nkiri La Plata"""
Kedu ihe ACMA kwubiri na Big Brother?,"The correct answer is **A: Ọ nweghị mmebi nke iwu nyocha emebeghị** (No breach of censorship laws occurred).

The passage states that ACMA found that Big Brother did not violate internet censorship laws. Therefore, option A is the most accurate summary of ACMA's conclusion.
"
Kedu ihe a chọrọ ka mgbasa ozi ga-egbo ka ewee ya dị ka ọdịnaya ịntanetị?,"The correct answer is **B: Ọ ga-adịrịrị na nkesa.**

The passage states: ""Etu ọ bụla a ga-esi echebara ndị̀na Ịntaneetị, ọ ga-ebirịrị n’anụ ahụ n’otu sava."" This implies that to be considered internet content, the content must physically reside on a server, hence meaning on a hosting server."
Kedu onye na-edu Liberal Party of Australia?,"The correct answer is **B: John Howard**.

The passage states that Peter Costello is ""expected to replace Prime Minister John Howard as leader of the Liberal party."" This means John Howard is *currently* the leader.
"
Kedu ihe kpatara na enweghị azụmahịa ike nuklia na Australia ugbua??,"The correct answer is **D: ọnụ ahịa dị elu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Mr. Kostello said that when nuclear power production becomes economically viable, Australia should move to ensure its implementation... If it became commercial, we should have it.""

This indicates that the current barrier to nuclear power in Australia is its lack of commercial viability, which directly translates to **high cost**. The others are not directly mentioned as the issue."
Kedu skier ji ntuziaka n'oge asọmpi ahụ niile?,"The correct answer is **C: Maciej Krezel**.

The passage states: ""Onye Poland kpuri isi bụ Maciej Krezel na-egwu egwuregwu ski, na onye ndu ya Anna Ogarzynska mechara onye nke iri na atọ na asọm mpi Supa-G."" This translates to ""The blind Polish skier Maciej Krezel is skiing, and his guide Anna Ogarzynska finished thirteenth in the Super-G competition.""

This indicates that Maciej Krezel is a blind skier who uses a guide during the competition.
"
"Na Super-G maka ọkwa ụmụ nwanyị, kedụ mba bịara n'ụzọ iri?","The correct answer is **A: Finland**. The passage states that Katja Saarinen from Finland finished tenth in the women's Super-G event.
"
"Kedu nkwupụta gbasara Blake bụ ihe na-abụghị eziokwu, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si dị?","The correct answer is **B: O kwetara iku ọrụ ahụ. (He admitted to the crime.)**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the journalist, Blake, ""gọnarịrị mwakpọ ahụ"" (denied the assault). Therefore, he did NOT admit to the crime.

The other options are true or implied by the passage:

*   A: N'ebe ahụ, a kpọchiri ya (There, he was imprisoned). The Judge stated it's very likely he would be imprisoned.
*   C: O were mkpara n’aka wakpoo (He used a pole to attack): The passage implies he was the one that attacked.
*   D: O kwuputara na ọ bụ ya bụ onye a tụrụ atụba karama (He stated that he was the one being attacked with bottles): The passage states ""Onye nta akụkọ, nke a nwụdoro n'ebe ihe mere, gọnarịrị mwakpọ ahụ ma sị na o ji polu ahụ were chekwaa onwe ya site na ụmụ karama a na-atụ ya site n'aka ndị ruru ndị mmadụ iri na atọ. (The journalist, who was present at the scene, denied the attack and said that he used the pole to defend himself from bottles being thrown at him by about thirteen people.)"""
"Dabere na ngalaba ahụ, Blake ahụghị nke n'ime ndị a?","The correct answer is **C: E ji mkpanaka tie ya**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the journalist ""denied the assault and said he used the pole to defend himself."" This means he *used* the pole, but it doesn't state he was *hit* with it.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the passage:

*   **A: N'ihi iji ikpe ziri ezi eme ihe n'ụzọ na-ezighị ezi, a mara ya ikpe:** The passage states ""Ikpe sokwere maa Blake maka ịnwa ibugharị usoro ikpe ziri ezi."" (Blake was then convicted of attempting to pervert the course of justice).
*   **B: A kpọgara ya n’ụlọ mkpọrọ:** While the passage doesn't explicitly say he *was* sent to prison, the judge stated it was ""highly likely"" (""ohere kariri na onweghi-ihe mgbochi"") that he *would* be imprisoned.
*   **D: A gwara ya na o yikarịrị ka a ga-ejide ya:** The passage directly says the judge told him it was ""highly likely"" he would be imprisoned."
Kedu ebumnuche nke United Nations agaghị etinye ego maka ikpo ọkụ zuru ụwa ọnụ?,"The correct answer is **D: Mbelata nke okpomọkụ zuru ụwa ọnụ pụta**

Here's why:

*   The passage states the U.N. wants to provide funds to help countries affected by global warming *cope* with its effects. The funds would be used for things like flood-resistant housing, better drought management, and diverse crops. The goal isn't to directly reduce the *cause* of global warming (although these actions may indirectly help), but rather to *adapt* to its consequences.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Ihe ubi mgbanwe** (Crop rotation): The text mentions different crops (ọkụkụ ihe dị iche iche) as a way to help countries adapt.
*   **B: Mba na-apụta na teknụzụ** (Emerging technologies): The text mentions supporting emerging nations as part of the overall goal.
*   **C: Ebe obibi nwere ike iguzogide idei mmiri** (Flood-resistant housing): The text specifically mentions this as a potential use of the funds."
"Kedu ihe UN na-ezube ịchekwa, dabere n'akụkụ akụkụ ahụ?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is:

**D: Ndị nlekọta mmiri na-ezughị ezu na-emetụta** (Inadequate water managers affected)

Here's why:

The text states that the U.N. hopes to provide funds to help all nations affected by global warming cope with its problems. It then mentions specific uses for this money, including building homes that can withstand floods, better drought management, and planting various crops. These all relate to the impact of global warming on water resources and the people who manage/are affected by them.  While the other options are related to environmental or economic issues, they aren't the primary focus of the UN's intended actions as described in the text.
"
Kedụ n’ime ihe ndịa ka Albert Muchanga na-ekwughi dika ihe ekwesiri ka ekwere na ya?,"The correct answer is **A: Ma ọbụrụna Benin ga-esonye AfCTA**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Albert Muchanga *kwuputara* that Benin would join. This means he *did* say Benin would join.
*   He also stated that they hadn't reached an agreement on rules of origin and tariff concessions, but that they still plan to start trading on July 1, 2020. This means he *did* talk about the start date, rules of origin, and tariff concessions."
"Gịnị kpatara ịzụ ahịa nwere ike ịmalite na Julaị, dị ka ekwuru n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: Usoro iwu na ebe obibi dị adị zuru oke**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Anyị enwebeghị nkwekọrịta maka iwu nke ebe mmepụta na mwepụ ụgwọ mbubata, mana atụmatụ anyị nwere zuru oke iji malite zụwa ahịa na Julaị 1, 2020"".
This directly implies that the existing plans, despite not having a complete agreement, were sufficient to begin trading. Therefore, the existing regulatory framework and setup were adequate.

Kedu ihe bụ akwụkwọ akụkọ Atlanta-Constitution boro ebubo ebubo ebubo na ndị ọrụ agụmakwụkwọ na-agụ akwụkwọ na akụkụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Na-ajụ ileba anya n'ime nsogbu ndị achọpụtara**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""...ndị ode akwụkwọ Atlanta depụtara akwụkwọ nke n'egosi nsogbu n'akara ule...ụlọakwụkwọ ahụ choputara n'ime onwe na e nwere nsogbu mana ha emeghi ihe ọbụla gbasara ihe ha chọpụtara."" This directly supports the idea that the school system was accused of failing to address identified problems."
"Kedu ihe na-efu na akụkọ Atlanta Journal-Constitution, n'ihi eziokwu ndị e nyere na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **C: Onye isi ala nke afọ maka 2013**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states she was named National Superintendent of the Year in **2009**, not 2013. All the other options are mentioned in the text."
"Kedu ozi a maara ugbu a n'ihe gbasara ogbunigwe ahụ, dị ka ekwuru n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: Nke ụlọ ndị dị nso mgbe ihe mgbawa gbawara**

Here's why:

*   **P states:** ""Otu ogbunigwe gbawara n'ezi ụlọ ọrụ onye isi ọchịchị. Ogbunigwe atọ ọzọ gbara na nsonso ụlọ gọọmenti gasị n'ime awa abụọ."" This explicitly states the proximity of the explosions to government buildings.
*   **A is partially correct:** The passage mentions varying reports about casualties (""mmadụ asatọ nwụrụ...mmadụ iri atọ merụrụ ahụ""). Therefore, the number of wounded can be inferred.
*   **C is incorrect:** The passage does not mention if another bomb will explode.
*   **D is incorrect:** The passage states that the final numbers are not known yet."
Kedu ọnụọgụgụ egwuregwu Jizọs sonyere na ya kemgbe ọ sonyeere Manchester City na 2017?,"The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The passage states: ""...kemgbe ahụ, onye Brazil a agbaala n'egwuregwu 53 maka klọb a n'asọmpi niile..."" which directly answers the question.
"
Kedu otu Jizọs kwụrụ ụgwọ mmalite £27 nde?,"The correct answer is **A: Palmeiras**.

The passage states that Jesus joined Manchester City from Palmeiras for £27 million.
"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị eziokwu gbasara ndị ọbịa ụlọ mbikọ?,"The correct answer is **D: Ọtụtụ ndị bịaranụ si n’obodo nsọ ahụ**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that those who frequented the accommodation were from the United Arab Emirates. This contradicts the statement that most of the visitors are from the city of Mecca, the holy city."
Kedu nke ziri ezi n'ime okwu ndị a dị ka ekwuru n'amaokwu a?,"The correct answer is **C: Ndị ọbịa ahụ rutere n'abalị nke njem Hajj.** (The visitors arrived the night following the Hajj pilgrimage)

Here's why:

*   **A: Ọ dịghị onye nwụrụ (No one died)** - This is incorrect. The passage states at least 15 people died.
*   **B: Ndị bi na United Arab Emirates mejupụtara ndị niile bịara ya (Residents of the United Arab Emirates made up everyone who came)** - This is incorrect. The passage only states that people from the UAE *frequently* visited the building, not that *only* people from the UAE did.
*   **D: Ọtụtụ n'ime ndị bịara ya bụ ụmụ amaala Mecca (Most of those who came were citizens of Mecca)** - This is incorrect. The passage indicates that pilgrims came to see the holy city. Pilgrims are people on a religious journey and likely not the residents of Mecca.
*   **C: Ndị ọbịa ahụ rutere n'abalị nke njem Hajj (The visitors arrived the night following the Hajj pilgrimage)** - This is correct. The passage specifically mentions, ""Ụfọdụ ndị njem ala nsọ bịara ịhụ obodo nsọ n'abalị na-esote hajj nọrọ n'ụlọ a"" which translates to ""Some pilgrims who came to see the holy city the night following Hajj were staying in this building."""
Kedu nkọwa nke mkpọka ahụ na-enweghị mgbagwoju anya n'ihe gbasara akụkụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Oke nke nkukota (The size of the collision)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ndị ọka mmụta sayensị sị na mgbasa nkụkọta isi ahụ butere dị ukwu. Ha ka na anwale ịchọpụta etu ibu mkpọka ahụ dị ma etu ọ ga-esi emetụta Uwa."" This translates to: ""Scientists say the debris field resulting from the collision is significant. They are still trying to determine the size of the impact and how it will affect Earth."" This directly addresses the question about the magnitude/size of the collision.

The other options are mentioned, but not as explicitly uncertain:

*   **B: Ebe ihe mberede ahụ mere (Location of the accident)**: The passage gives the satellites' altitude: ""sukọrọ ọnụ maịlị 491 n’elu Eluụwa (orbiting 491 miles above Earth)."" While not a precise location, it provides context.
*   **C: Mmeghachi omume ụwa maka nkukota ahụ (Earth's reaction to the collision)**: The passage mentions scientists are ""still trying to determine ... how it will affect Earth.""
*   **D: Ebe ihe mkpofu dị (Location of the debris)**: The United States Strategic Command is tracking the debris, implying they have an idea of its location.

Therefore, only the ""size of the collision"" is explicitly mentioned as something scientists are *still* trying to determine."
"Kedu ihe amabeghị gbasara nkukota a, dị ka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **D: Ọnụ ọgụgụ ziri ezi nke nkukota ahụ** (The exact size of the collision).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Ha ka na anwale ịchọpụta etu ibu mkpọka ahụ dị ma etu ọ ga-esi emetụta Uwa"" (They are still trying to determine the size of the impact and how it will affect Earth). This directly indicates the size of the collision is unknown.
*   The passage also mentions that the United States Strategic Command is tracking debris from the collision. This implies they haven't fully assessed the size and scope of the debris field resulting from the collision.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   The passage mentions the satellites' speed.
*   The passage mentions that nyocha ga-ezi nga ozī nyocha nke nkata akpara n'otu weebụsaịtị ọha (research results will be sent to a public website)
*   There is no mention of who will be responsible for the hunt."
"Kedu ọkwá Batten nwere na mbụ na ndepụta ndị America kasị baa ọgaranya, dabere na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **C: 190th**

The passage states that E. Claiborne Robins Jr. was ranked 190th on the 2008 Forbes 400 list.
"
Kedu nke Batten nyere n'ime ihe ndị a?,"The correct answer is **B: Mahadum Virginia**.

The passage states that Batten is ""onye na enye onyinye ama ama n'ụlọ akwụkwọ ahụ"", which translates to ""a prominent donor to that school"".  ""Ụlọ akwụkwọ ahụ"" refers to the University of Virginia mentioned earlier in the passage. So, Batten gave donations to the University of Virginia.

"
"Kedu onye tụfuru ihe a na-ekwu, dabere na akụkụ akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **C: Miller**.

The passage states that Mila (presumably Miller) didn't hear what Mike was saying because she was ""preparing"" for him.
"
"Dabere na paragraf ahụ, kedụ n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara ahụmịhe ntị Miller ziri ezi?","The correct answer is **B: Ka ọ nọ na-akwado, o yiri ka o nweghị mmasị.**

Here's why:

*   **The text states Mila was preparing for something (supporting Mike) and therefore wasn't paying attention to what Mike was saying (""anụghị m ihe ọ na-ekwu"").** This implies a lack of engagement or interest in what was being said.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: N'oge a na-ege ntị, Duvall hapụrụ mmetụta na Miller:** The text says Duvall wasn't even present during the incident Mila is talking about.
*   **C: N'ime oge ikpe a, ụmụ Duvall abụọ kwuru ọtụtụ ihe:** The text doesn't mention anything about Duvall's children speaking during this time.
*   **D: Ọ nọ na-ege ntị nke ọma n'ihe Duvall na-ekwu:** The text directly contradicts this, stating she *didn't* hear what he was saying."
"""Onye nyere aro ka agbanwee """"Iwube ikuku dị ọcha""""?""","The correct answer is **D: Stephen Harper**.

The passage states: ""Onye isi oche Stivin Hapa ekwetala iziga iwu ọhụrụ nke ikuku ọcha nke gọọmenti ebe a ga elebara ya anya..."" (President Stephen Harper agreed to send the government's new Clean Air Act to be looked at...). This indicates that Stephen Harper is the one who proposed the Clean Air Act. Note that the question asked who proposed the ""Clean Air Act"", not who asked for changes to it.
"
"""Kedu onye rụrụ ụka nkwuputa na """"Clean Air Act"""" bụ gimmick tupu ntuli aka?""","The correct answer is **D: Onye omebe iwu etiti**.

The passage states ""...government state and some federal government MPs have spoken out against the move saying it was a politically motivated stunt ahead of federal politics coming in November"". This means the Federal MPs are ones that believe it is a gimmick, so **Onye omebe iwu etiti** (Federal MPs) is the correct answer."
"Mgbe ihe melamine na cyanuric acid na-emeghachi omume na mmamịrị nwamba, gịnị si na ya pụta?","The correct answer is **C: Crystals**.

The passage states: ""The researchers found that it formed stones when melamine and cyanuric acid were added to cat urine. The composition of these crystals was similar to those found in the kidneys of affected pets, as seen by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).""  Since the ""stones"" are made of crystals, the answer is crystals.
"
Gịnị bụ ihe ndị ọkà mmụta sayensị pụrụ ịhụ na-eji infrared spectroscopy?,"The correct answer is **B: crystallization nke mmamịrị anụ ụlọ**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Ngwakọta nke kristal ndị a dị ka ndị a hụrụ n'amịrị ụmụ anụmanụ ụlọ ndị emetụtara, ma e jiri infrared spektroskopi (FTIR) lee ya."" This means the scientists used infrared spectroscopy to observe the crystals in the urine of the affected animals.
The other options are incorrect because:

*   A: Ịrụ ọrụ akụrụ - Ọ bụ ezie na akụrụ akụrụ na-akwụsị ọrụ, a naghị ahụ ya ozugbo site na infrared spectroscopy.

Tommy Dreamer is the one who referred to Luna as ""Queen of Extreme"".
"
"""Ònye kọwara Luna dị ka onye """"na-akpa ike""""?""","The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

Tommy Dreamer said, ""Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the moon. There will never be another like her. **A strong woman**.""
"
Gịnị kwesịrị ime onye ọkwọ ụgbọala ihe mberede mere?,"The correct answer is **D: Ndị ọrụ mberede nyeere ya aka ịhapụ ụgbọ ala ya** (Emergency services helped him out of his car).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""E mechiri nwa oge okporo ụzọ ahụ ebe ihe mberede mere ebe ndị ọrụ mberede tọhapụrụ onye ọkwọ ụgbọ ala ahụ site na Audi TT na-acha uhie."" This directly confirms option D.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: E merụrụ ya n'isi (He was injured in the head)** The passage mentions that the driver was badly injured in the head.
*   **B: Ndị niile bi n’ụlọ ahụ nọ na-enwere onwe ha mmerụ ahụ ya (All the occupants of the house were free from injury)** The passage mentions that all the people in the house were safe from injury.
*   **C: E zigara ya n'ụlọ ọgwụ dị na Great Yarmouth site na otu na Cambridge (He was sent to a hospital in Great Yarmouth from one in Cambridge)** The passage mentions that he was first taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth and then moved to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge."
Omume ndị otu South Africa mere n'oge asọmpi rugby enweghị ntụpọ n'ụzọ ọ bụla?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Mmekọ ọnụ mara mma**.

The passage highlights South Africa's:

*   **Ụzọ mkpachapụ anya ha n’ime mgbochi (Careful approach in defense):** This relates to their defensive capabilities (D).
*   **ka ha si ejide bọọlụ (How they handle the ball):** This relates to their ball control (B).
*   **ụzọ nhàzi pụrụ iche (Unique coordination):** This clearly refers to their teamwork and coordination (A).

While they won their first match convincingly, the passage states they ""melitere nwayọ nwayọ ka ịsọ mpi gara n'ihu"" (improved slowly as the competition progressed), suggesting they weren't necessarily showing expert performance right from the start (C). The focus is on their improving teamwork, defense and ball control throughout the competition.
"
"Kedu ihe egwuregwu South Africa malitere ịka mma, dịka akụkụ nke ya si dị?","The correct answer is **D: Ka egwuregwu na-aga n'ihu**

The passage explicitly states that ""ndị mba Sawụt Afrịka melitere nwayọ nwayọ ka ịsọ mpi gara n'ihu"" which translates to ""the South African team improved slowly as the competition progressed"".

Here's why:

*   The passage states that China exported *more* cars than Germany *last year*. This directly contradicts option D.

Let's look at the other options:

*   A: Kemgbe emejuputa mgbanwe mgbanwe, aku na uba China abawanyela nke ukwuu (Since implementing reforms, the Chinese economy has increased significantly): The passage states that the economy has grown by a factor of 9 since the reforms, supporting this claim.
*   B: E jiri ya tụnyere United States, China nwere nnukwu ahịa mbupụ maka ụgbọ ala (Compared to the United States, China has a large export market for cars): The passage mentions that China surpassed the US as the largest market for the automotive industry, supporting this.
*   C: GDP China nwere ike karịa nke United States n'ọdịnihu (China's GDP may be larger than that of the United States in the future): The passage states China's economy *could* be larger than the US in two decades, supporting this."
"Kedu mgbe GDP China nwere ike gafere nke United States, ka akụkụ ahụ kwuru?","The correct answer is **B: Afọ iri abụọ site ugbu a**.

The passage states, ""Aku na Uba mba China nwere ike idi ukwu karia nke mba United State na agbata ogu-afo abuo"" which translates to ""China's economy could be larger than the United States in about twenty years.""
"
Gịnị bụ ndụmọdụ Hu maka mba ndị ka na-emepe emepe?,"The correct answer is **D: Na-ezere imetọ ụzọ ochie**.

The passage states: ""Hu gbara obodo ndị na emepe emepe ume """"ka ha ghara itinye aka n'usoro omume mgbe ochie bụ ibu ụzọ metọọ were kpochawa ma emechaa."""" ""  This directly translates to avoiding the old way of polluting first and cleaning up later.
"
Gịnị ka Hu hapụrụ ikwu?,"The correct answer is **D: Ọnụ ego nke mbelata nke ikuku carbon**.

The passage states: ""O kwughi oke a ga-akwụ..."" which translates to ""He did not say how much this would cost...""

Therefore, the answer is D.
"
"N'okwu Veerman, ònye n'ime ihe ndị a kọwara ọnọdụ ahụ nke ọma?","The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

Richard Veerman, the spokesperson for Medicines Sans Frontieres, said: ""Angola is going through its worst outbreak ever and the situation is still critical within Angola."" He was specifically describing the situation *within* Angola.
"
Kedu onye ga-ejupụta oche nke Huhne ugbu a ka ndị ikpe amalitela?,"The correct answer is **A: Davey**.

The passage states that ""Huhne agbaala arukwaghi ma onye ga anochi ya na otu ndi oso-eze achi bu Ed Davey MP."" This translates to ""Huhne has resigned and Ed Davey MP from the Liberal Democrats will replace him.""
"
"Mgbe ikpe ahụ gasịrị, onye ga-eweghara ọrụ dị ka Minista Azụmahịa?","The correct answer is **A: Nwa Atụrụ (Lamb)**.

The passage states that Norman Lamb MP is expected to take Davey's position as Business Secretary. ""Nwa Atụrụ"" is the Igbo translation for ""Lamb.""
"
Kedu ihe ndị na-eme ihe nkiri na-agba ndị na-ege ntị ume ka ha mee mgbe ha na-ege opera nke Camille Saint-Saens?,"The answer is **A: Jiri wii wii**.

The prompt states that the opera is about an artist whose life is ruled by ""love for Japan and drugs,"" and that performers are smoking weed on stage. Therefore, they're implicitly encouraging the audience to also use weed.
"
"N'oge opera, onye na-afụ ọnụ nkwonkwo ugboro ugboro?","The correct answer is **C: Ndị na-ese ihe** (The artists).

The prompt says ""ndị na-ese ihe na-ese igbo n'ebe ngosi ihe"" which translates to ""the artists smoke igbo in the opera house"".

Therefore, the answer is **C**.
"
Kedu okwu ọzọ ị ga-eji kọwaa ''spacewalk'' Leonov?,"The correct answer is **C: ọrụ ụgbọ ala inyeaka**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states that Leonov's spacewalk was the ""first extravehicular activity (EVA), or 'spacewalk'"". EVA is the term used for work done outside the spacecraft. ""Ọrụ ụgbọ ala inyeaka"" is the translation for the english term EVA.

Let's eliminate the other options:

*   **A: Njem Apollo-Soyuz** The Apollo-Soyuz mission was a joint US-Soviet mission that Leonov commanded years later, but it wasn't the spacewalk itself.
*   **B: Ọsọ Oghere:** While ""spacewalk"" does involve space travel, the term for it isn't ""ọsọ oghere"".
*   **D: Onye na-ahụ maka oghere nke 11:** This refers to Leonov's title but doesn't describe the spacewalk itself."
Kedu ozi Leonov duziri maka Soviet Union?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**.

The passage states: ""Ka afọ iri gachara, o duuru ngalaba Sọviet nke ozi Apolo Soyuz nke gosiri na ọsọ gbasara oghere mpụga uwa eruola na njedebe.""
"
Kedu onye merụrụ ahụ n'ihe mberede ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Gibson**.

The passage states that Gibson was taken to the hospital after the accident but died shortly after.
"
Gịnị mere ndị kpatara ihe mberede ahụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Otu nwụrụ ma onye nke ọzọ emerụghị ahụ**

Here's why:

*   The passage states Gibson died (""nwụrụ"") and the truck driver was uninjured (""emerụghị ahụ"")."
Kedu n'ime mmetụta ndị a ka ndị ọkà mmụta sayensị na-arụ ọrụ na mmemme ahụ nwere olileanya ịhụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Ndị agha ebili mmiri**.

The passage states: ""Mmetụta otu ahụ nọ na-achọ ga-esite n'aka ikikere taịdị ndị dị n'etiti mata ojii nke galaxy na mata ojii nke Milky Way."" ""Ikikere taịdị"" translates to ""tidal forces"". Therefore, the scientists are hoping to see tidal forces.
"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a ka ndị nchọpụta na-amụ?,"The correct answer is **D: Milky Way na ụyọkọ kpakpando Sagittarius**.

The passage discusses how the Milky Way galaxy exerts a tidal force on the Sagittarius galaxy, similar to how the moon affects the Earth's tides. The scientists are studying the interaction between these two galaxies.
"
Kedu ihe na-adịghị n'okpuru nkatọ site na conservatives na ìhè nke Itie?,"Based on the passage, the focus of the criticism by conservatives is primarily on **C: Kedu onye na-enweta nkwekọrịta maka mwughachi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions ""ụfọdụ ndị kweere na iji nwayọ emefụ ego steeti akọwaala mmefu a n'ụzọ ntọrọmọchị dịka """"Nkwekọrịta Niu Ọlịns nke Bush mere"""". Nnyocha nke mgbalị nrụgharị chere ihu na-enye ndị e chere na ha bụ ndị si Wọshịntịn ọrụ nrụgharị."" This directly points to the controversy over who was awarded the reconstruction contracts, implying a perception of favoritism towards those connected to Washington, D.C.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely to be the *primary* focus of conservative criticism based on the passage:

*   **A: Mmefu maka ebumnuche mmadụ**: While conservatives might generally be critical of government spending, the passage doesn't specifically highlight this as the central concern regarding the Katrina reconstruction. The issue is *who* is benefiting from the spending, not just the spending itself.
*   **B: Mmgbalị ezughị ezu iji wughachi**: The passage doesn't focus on the *adequacy* of the reconstruction efforts, but rather on the *distribution* of resources and contracts.
*   **D: Na-emefu na nrụzi**: While spending is a factor, the focus is on WHO gets the contract
"
Kedu onye na-emegide nkwekọrịta mwughachi maka mbọ enyemaka Hurricane Katrina?,"The answer is **A: ndị nchekwa akụ na ụba**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""ụfọdụ ndị kweere na iji nwayọ emefụ ego steeti akọwaala mmefu a n'ụzọ ntọrọmọchị dịka """"Nkwekọrịta Niu Ọlịns nke Bush mere""""."" This implies that those who are fiscally conservative (i.e., ndị nchekwa akụ na ụba) would be against the spending related to the reconstruction efforts.

The other options are less likely:

*   **B: Ndị nnwere onwe**While individual libertarians might have varying views, the passage doesn't provide specific evidence to suggest widespread opposition from libertarians as a group.
*   **C: Osisi**This is not relevant to the context of the question.
*   **D: Ndị ọkachamara na Washington** The passage mentions that people from Washington were given reconstruction jobs but does not refer to people in Washington opposing the deal."
"Ebee ka a ga-ahụ ọkụ si n'ụgbọelu Stardust na mbụ, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si dị?","The correct answer is **B: North California**.

The passage states: ""Ọ ga agafe ụsọ oke osimiri ọdịda anyanwụ nke northern Kalifonia ma mukekwaa ihu igwe..."". This indicates that Northern California will be the first place to witness the Stardust spacecraft entering the atmosphere.
"
"A na-akọ na ụgbọ elu ahụ ga-agbaji n'ime ndekọ ndị a, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **C: ụzọ kacha ọsọ azụ n'ụwa**.

The passage states: ""Stardust ga atoo ndeko oge ohuu nke oji buru ugboelu kacha agbasi ike na njem iji ilaghachite n'uwa..."". This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Na-enye ìhè kachasị mbara igwe:** While the passage mentions a ""light show,"" the focus is on speed records, not brightness.
*   **B: Inwe ọnụnọ kacha ukwuu na obodo:** The passage describes the trajectory of the capsule over specific states but does not discuss the number of people who may have witnessed the event.
*   **D: Ụzọ kachasị ọsọ si San Francisco gaa Los Angeles:** While the passage uses the distance from San Francisco to Los Angeles to give a comparison to how fast the craft was traveling, it is not explicitly mentioning that it is setting a record for traveling between those two cities."
Mmekọrịta dị n'etiti Saroja Balasubramanian na Dr. Malar Balasubramanian amabeghị?,"The correct answer is **C: Nne** (Mother).

The passage states: ""Achuhura Dr. Malar Balasubramanian, 29,...ka ahuchara nne ya na azu ugbo-ala na-onwu n’ubochi Wednesde..."" This translates to ""Dr. Malar Balasubramanian... is being charged with aggravated murder after her mother was found dead in the trunk on Wednesday...""
"
Ebee ka achọtara ozu Sara Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **C: N'ime akpati ụgbọ ala**.

The passage states: ""Achọtara ozu Saroja Balasubramanian... ebe ahụ, ja akwa mkpuchi kpudoro ya."" This means Saroja Balasubramanian's body was found in the trunk (akpati) of the car.
"
Kedu ihe eBay zụtara?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

The passage states: ""The company hoped to extend its profit margins and extend its brand name into areas where Skype had an established presence, such as China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil."" This clearly indicates that eBay acquired Skype.
"
Kedu ihe eBay chọrọ imezu site na ịzụta?,"The correct answer is **B: Mee ka mpaghara ala gị gbasaa** and **C: Mee ka ọ pụta ìhè**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the company hoped to ""expand its budding profit base and raise its profile in Skype's established markets, such as China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil.""

Therefore, the eBay chọrọ imezu site na ịzụta bụ *Mee ka mpaghara ala gị gbasaa* na *Mee ka ọ pụta ìhè*."
"Ònye, dị ka Akwụkwọ Nsọ si kwuo, na-ezere iso ndị mkpọrọ fọdụrụ n'ogige ahụ mgbe agha ahụ gasịrị na-akpakọrịta?","The correct answer is **B: Ndị otu nnapụta maka ndị ọrụ mgbanyụ ọkụ**

Here's why:

*   The passage describes negotiators trying to bring peace, police officers entering the yard, and firefighters extinguishing the fire.
*   It doesn't mention the presence of a rescue team for the firefighters or other rescue members."
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a mere ka ndị a mara ikpe gbasasịa na ọgba aghara ahụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Gas na-egbu egbu**.

The passage states that officers in riot gear entered the yard and used tear gas to herd the inmates together. This action directly caused the inmates to scatter in the chaos of the riot.
"
"Kedu ihe Iran kwesịrị iwepụ onwe ya, ka Ayatollah Ali Khamenei siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **D: ịdabere na mmanụ**

The passage states that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei described the reliance on oil as a ""wound"" that the country should free itself from.
"
"Ònye kwetara mmetụta nke mmachi na Iranian aku na uba, dị ka e kwuru na akụkụ?","The correct answer is **A: Ochie isi mmalite**.

The passage states: ""Okwuntukwasa ndi ahu, nke telivishon gosiri ka o na eme, bu izizi ndi isi Iran kwetere na ikike anapuru ha metutara ha."" This translates to: ""Those sanctions, as shown on television, were the first time Iranian leaders admitted that they were affected by the deprivations.""

Therefore, it was the **Iranian leaders** who admitted to the impact of the sanctions. The closest answer choice is ""Ochie isi mmalite"", which translates to ""Old source"" or ""The original source"". Given the context, it's clear this refers to the Iranian leaders themselves.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: OPEC** is mentioned in the context of oil production decline, not admission of the sanctions' impact.
*   **C: Ali Khamenei, Ayatollah** is mentioned as criticizing the reliance on oil, but not specifically admitting the impact of current sanctions.
*   **D: Njikọ nke European States** imposed the sanctions, but did not admit their impact on the Iranian economy."
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-adịghị eme n'oge usoro ntuli aka French?,"Based on the passage, the answer is **B: Ndị nnọchiteanya ezigara ndị na-aga ime**.

The passage describes representatives being sent by taxpayers to witness the tax process, not by candidates during an election. The other options are explicitly mentioned or implied in the text:

*   **A: Igwe ịtụ vootu a na-ahụ anya** - The passage mentions ""ụmụ igbe ntuli aka ga-abụrịrị ngafe-ahụ-ụzọ"" (ballot boxes must be transparent).
*   **C: Mbinye aka n'akwụkwọ ịtụ vootu** - The passage mentions the taxpayer signing the tax documents.
*   **D: Ndị nnọchite anya ntuli aka na-agụ vootu** - The passage mentions ""ndị ọrụ efu ga agụkọ ụtụ nile na oke nlegideanya"" (unpaid workers will count all taxes with great care)."
Ebee ka ndị ntuli aka na-etinye mmasị n'ọsọ ha?,"The correct answer is **B: Na mpempe akwụkwọ ebipụtalarị.**

The passage states: ""ndị na-atụ ụtụ na ewezuga onwe ha n'otu ụlọ ndo, tinye akwụkwọ ebiri na ndịnihu nke na-egosi onye ha na atụrụ ụtụ n'ime akwụkwọ amachiri amachi."" This indicates that voters mark their choices on pre-printed ballots.
"
Kedu ihe kpaliri Allen ịmalite ichu nta ya afọ asatọ maka Musashi?,"The correct answer is **D: Ịnụ ọkụ n'obi ya maka esemokwu ahụ**.

The passage states that Allen started searching for Musashi ""maka nnukwu aguu onwere gbasara agha,"" which translates to ""because of his great enthusiasm for war"" or ""because of his great passion for conflict"". This directly corresponds to option D.
"
"Kedu ihe Allen mefuru nnukwu ego ya, dị ka ekwuru n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: Nnyocha nke oké osimiri** (Exploration of the sea).

Here's why:

*   The passage states Allen invested a large amount of his fortune in ""ọrụ nchoputa ihe no na mmiri"" which translates to ""underwater exploration projects."" This is directly related to the broader concept of sea exploration.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Na-eweghachi Musashi azụ** (Recovering Musashi): While finding the Musashi was the goal, the text indicates the spending was on the exploration leading to the discovery.
*   **C: Na-arụ ọrụ ROV** (Operating ROV): ROVs were *part* of the exploration, but not the sole focus of Allen's spending.
*   **D: Na-amụ maapụ nke oke osimiri** (Studying maps of the ocean): Creating sea bed maps was also part of the exploration, but the text implies this was just one method used in the larger sea exploration project."
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si kwuo, o yikarịrị ka ọ kpatara ọnọdụ dị ize ndụ n'ime na n'èzí osisi ahụ?","The correct answer is **A: Atọmịk ike**. Here's why:

*   **The passage describes a nuclear power plant emergency.** The mention of radioactive cesium and iodine, along with the possibility of fuel rods melting down, strongly indicates a problem within the nuclear reactor itself. This means the dangerous situation stems from the uncontrolled release of **nuclear energy**.
*   **Radioactive cesium and iodine (B and D)** are *results* of the nuclear reaction going wrong, not the *cause* of the dangerous situation itself.
*   **Smoke (C)** is a visual indicator of a problem, but not the root cause of the danger. The smoke likely contains radioactive particles, but the core issue is the uncontrolled release of nuclear materials due to problems in the core of the nuclear plant.

Therefore, while the other options are related to the emergency, **nuclear energy** being out of control is the most likely *cause* of the dangerous situation."
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị otu n'ime ndụmọdụ nchekwa enyere ndị obodo n'ihi ihe mere osisi ahụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Zere iku ume na anwụrụ ọkụ**

Here's why:

*   **A: Zere iji ikuku ntụ oyi** (Avoid using air conditioning) - This was a direct recommendation from the passage (gbanyụọ ntụ oyi - turn off air conditioning).
*   **B: Nọrọ n'ime ụlọ** (Stay indoors) - This was also a direct recommendation (nọrọ n'ime ụlọ - stay indoors).
*   **D: Zere ịṅụ mmiri pọmpụ** (Avoid drinking tap water) - This was another direct recommendation (ghara iṅu mmiri na-agba n'ụlọ - do not drink tap water).

The passage doesn't explicitly mention avoiding breathing in smoke. While it is a good safety measure in general with smoke, it was not a direct recommendation given to the townspeople."
"Kedu ihe kacha enye nsogbu gbasara XDR-TB, n'echiche Dr. Moll?","The correct answer is **D: Ọnụ ọgụgụ ọnwụ ya dị elu**.

The passage states that Dr. Moll described the new strain as causing """"oke nsogbu ma bụrụkwa ihe egwu n'ihi ogugo ọnwụ dị elu si na ya abịa,"""" which translates to """"a huge problem and a threat because of the high death rate associated with it."""" This directly indicates that the high death rate is what Dr. Moll finds most concerning.
"
Ole ndị ekwenyesiri ike na ụdị mgbanwe ọhụrụ a n'etiti ndị ọrịa bụ ndị ọkachamara ahụike?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The passage states, ""ma ihe dị ka abụọ bụ ndị ọrụ ụlọ ọgwụ."" (""but about two were hospital staff"").
"
Kedu teknụzụ nke usoro NextGen na-arụ ọrụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Teknụzụ na-eji satellites**.

The passage states that NextGen ""ji teknụzụ satilaịti dị iche na teknụzụ rada nọ n'ala..."" which directly translates to ""uses satellite technology instead of ground-based radar technology..."" Therefore, option A is the most accurate.
"
Kedu uru bụ uru NextGen maka ndị na-ahụ maka ụgbọ elu?,"The correct answers based on the passage are:

*   **B: Ntinye ụgbọ elu ka mma** (Better air traffic management) - The passage states NextGen helps air traffic controllers know the precise location of aircraft.
*   **C: Obere ikuku carbon** (Lower carbon emissions) - The passage indicates NextGen saves fuel and reduces emissions.
*   **D: Obere mmanụ ụgbọala ojiji** (Less fuel usage) - The passage explicitly mentions that NextGen saves millions of gallons of fuel per year.

Option A is not a direct benefit to air traffic controllers, but rather a result of the system.

"Kedu akụkụ ndị FBI lekwasịrị anya ka ndị ọkọ akụkọ ihe mere eme na-agbaghabeghị, dịka akụkụ akwụkwọ akụkọ ahụ siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **B: Na-eduzi akụrụngwa maka mpụ ndị enwere ike idozi ngwa ngwa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that historians have criticized the FBI for focusing resources on easily solved cases (like stolen vehicles) to inflate their success rates. This is precisely what option B describes.
*   Option A aligns with the aim of the FBI to inflate their success rates by directing resources to easily solved cases.
*   Option C and D are specific examples mentioned in the passage, supporting the more general concept described in option B.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate summary of the criticism."
Gịnị bụ ọrụ FBI n'okpuru atụmatụ rụrụ arụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Na-ebuli ọnụego ihe ịga nke ọma nke ụlọ ọrụ ahụ**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that FBI agents were accused of focusing on easier cases (like stolen vehicles) to ""ịkwalite nsìàga ọganihu ha,"" which translates to ""boost their success rates.""
*   The other options are either too specific (relating only to stolen vehicles or pornography) or misinterpret the purpose of focusing on easier cases.

Therefore, the main purpose of the FBI's alleged actions, according to the passage, was to inflate their success rates."
Kedu ihe mere gwongworo ọkụ a kpọrọ n'ihe mberede JAS 39C Gripen? ,"The correct answer is **B: Ọ tụgharịrị**

The passage states: ""Ndị mgbasa ozi ebeụlọ na-akọ maka ụgbọ ala mgbanyụ ọkụ ọdụ ụgbọ elu tụgharịrị n'okpuru ya mgbe ọ na-aza.""  This directly translates to ""Local media reports the airport fire truck turned over while responding.""
"
Kedu ihe amachibidoro n'ọdụ ụgbọ elu n'ihi ihe mberede JAS 39C Gripen?,"The correct answer is **A: ọrụ ụgbọ elu**.

The passage states that ""all flights at the airport have been cancelled"" due to the JAS 39C Gripen accident. This means flight operations have been prohibited.
"
Ònye natara ndụmọdụ n'aka Brzezinski n'oge Mgbanwe nke Iran?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter**.

The passage states that Brzezinski advised Carter on foreign policy in the 1976 election and helped him manage international events as NSA, including the Iranian Revolution.
"
"Ruo 1977, ònye jere ozi dị ka onye ndụmọdụ nchekwa obodo?","The correct answer is B: Kissinger.

The passage states that Brzezinski served as National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981, ""in succession to Henry Kissinger"". This means Kissinger held the position before Brzezinski.
"
Kedu n'ime okwu ndị a gbasara oge Bobek na Partizan Belgrade bụ nke na-abụghị eziokwu?,"The correct answer is **A: Mgbe ọ bụ onye otu, ọ kpakọbara ihe karịrị 468 mgbaru ọsọ**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Bobek scored 403 goals in 468 appearances. Option A states that he scored more than 468 goals, which is false.
*   Option B is true. No one has scored more goals in Partizan Belgrade than Bobek.
*   Option D is true. He was named Partizan's greatest player.
*   Option C is a tricky one. While the passage mentions he was named the best in Partizan's history in 1995, it doesn't say if that was the first and only time. It's possible he received other accolades during his playing career, so this option can't be definitively proven false based on the passage.

Therefore, option A is the only definitively false statement based on the provided text."
Kedu nke bụ eziokwu gbasara ihe mere Bobek na Partizan Belgrade gara aga?,"The correct answer is **A: Na 1945, ọ bịanyere aka na-egwu Partizan**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""O sonyere ha na 1945 ma nọrọ ruo 1958"", which translates to ""He joined them in 1945 and stayed until 1958"". This confirms option A.
*   B is accurate but not true of what *happened before* he played with Partizan
*   C is incorrect because the passage says he stayed until 1958, not 1995.
*   D is inaccurate, as the passage describes that ""Bobek nwetara ọmụma mgbe ọ na-agbara Partizan Belgradi"", which suggests that he became popular while playing for Partizan Belgrade. He wasn't popular because he was tributed with being the best player of Partizan."
"Kedu ihe dị iche na Hesperonychus na Velociraptor, dịka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ si kwuo?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: Ụkwụ nke abụọ ka ibu**.

The passage explicitly states that Hesperonychus had a larger second toe claw, which is where the name ""Hesperonychus"" (meaning ""western claw"") comes from. The passage does not state that this is different from the Velociraptor, but does highlight this feature for the Hesperonychus.
"
"""Kedu akụkụ nke ụdị 'morphological etemeete bụ isi iyi nke aha """"Hesperonychus""""?""","The correct answer is **A: Ụkwụ ya**.

The passage states that the second claw of its foot was larger, which led to the name Hesperonychus, meaning ""western claw"".
"
Kedu nke ziri ezi n'ime okwu ndị na-esote banyere agbapụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **D: Na Buffalo, e nwere égbè** (In Buffalo, there was a shooting).

Here's why:

*   **A: Ma di ma nwunye si Texas (Both husband and wife are from Texas)** - This is incorrect. The text says they got married in Texas and came to Buffalo to celebrate. The husband is from Buffalo.
*   **B: Mmadụ ise merụrụ ahụ (Five people were injured)** - This is incorrect. The text says that four people were killed. It does not mention any injuries.
*   **C: Agbamakwụkwọ a mere na Buffalo otu afọ gara aga (The wedding was in Buffalo a year ago)** - This is incorrect. The wedding was in Texas a year ago.
*   **D: Na Buffalo, e nwere égbè (In Buffalo, there was a shooting)** - This is correct. The text clearly states that the husband was one of four people killed in a shooting."
Kedu nke bụ eziokwu n'ime okwu ndị a gbasara ememme ahụ bụ ebe a gbara egbe ahụ? ,"The correct answer is **A: Ememe ncheta Buffalo bụ ebe o mere.**

The passage states that the couple got married in Texas a year ago but came to Buffalo to celebrate their anniversary with friends and family. Therefore, the shooting occurred at the anniversary celebration in Buffalo.
"
"Kedu ihe bụ nchegbu gọọmentị mbụ gbasara Luno, dị ka ekwuru n'amaokwu ahụ?","Based on the provided passage, the primary concern regarding the Luno was:

**C: Mgbapu mmanụ** (Oil spill)

The passage explicitly mentions that the Luno contained 120-160 cubic meters of oil when it broke down. This would naturally lead to immediate concerns about a potential oil spill.
"
"Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara ọdịda Luno bụ nke na-abụghị eziokwu, dabere n'akụkụ akụkụ ahụ?","Let's analyze each statement based on the given text:

*   **A: Arụmọrụ ahụ mere tupu ibunye ibu ahụ:** The text states ""Ụgbọ mmiri toruru mita otu narị nọ n'ụzọ ibute fatịlaịza"". This implies the accident happened *before* it loaded the fertilizer. So, this statement is TRUE.

*   **B: N'oge mmebi ahụ, ụgbọ mmiri ahụ nwere mmanụ ụgbọala 100 mita:** The text says it had ""kubik mita 120-160 nke mmanụ"". 100 cubic meters falls outside this range. So, this statement is FALSE.

*   **C: Otu onye ọrụ n'ime mmadụ iri na abụọ ahụ nwere mmerụ ahụ:** The text mentions ""sọ mmerụ ahụ enwere bụ mgbawa imi."" This means only one person had a nose fracture. So, this statement is TRUE.

*   **D: A manyere ụgbọ ahụ ka ọ ghara imebi mmiri:** The text says ""oke ifufe na ebili mmiri dubara ya n'ime brekwọta ahụ."" This implies it was forced onto the breakwater due to the weather conditions. So, this statement is TRUE.

Therefore, the incorrect statement is B.

**Final Answer: B**"
Kedu mgbe Algeria nwetara nnwere onwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Afọ 1960**

The passage states that Vautier returned to the newly independent Algeria in the 1960s. This implies that Algeria gained its independence sometime in the 1960s."
Ebee ka etinyeghị ihe onyonyo maka ọrụ olili?,"The correct answer is **D: Gburugburu ogige St. Peter**

The passage states that the crowds were so large that not everyone could fit in St. Peter's Square. Therefore, large screens were placed *elsewhere* in Rome so people could watch. This implies screens were *not* placed *inside* St. Peter's Square itself, as the goal was to accommodate people who *couldn't* be there. The other options were mentioned in the passage as locations where screens were placed.
"
Olee ebe e mere ememe ncheta?,"The best answer is **A: N'ofe Rome niile, n'ebe dị iche iche**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that large screens were set up in multiple locations in Rome to allow people to view the ceremony because St. Peter's Square couldn't accommodate everyone. This means the ceremonies were being watched (and implicitly, remembered/commemorated) in various places across Rome.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: N'ime Poland:** The passage mentions commemorations occurred in Poland, but the question specifically asks where the *memorial ceremony* took place. Poland hosted its own separate commemorations, not the main ceremony.
*   **C: Gburugburu ogige St. Peter:** While the core of the funeral mass was in St. Peter's Square, the passage explicitly says that not everyone could fit there, implying that other locations were used for viewing/remembering.
*   **D: Na Rome mbụ, emesia obodo Italy ọzọ:** The passage indicates Rome and Italy as locations for the ceremony. The phrase 'Rome mbụ, emesia obodo Italy ọzọ' does not match the statement.

"
Ònye nwetara nlekọta ahụike siri ike mgbe mgbawa ahụ gasịrị?,"The correct answer is **A: Mmadụ ise ma ọ bụ karịa.**

The passage states: ""o pekata mpe ọ bụrụ mmadụ ise nọ n’ebe ahụ mgbe ihe mgbawa ahụ gbawara ka agwọrọ maka mgbaàmà nkụja."" This directly indicates that at least five people received medical treatment for shock symptoms after the explosion.
"
Onye kwuru na mgbaze gas ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ezigbo enyi na ụlọ ahụ**.

The passage states that a neighbor called about a gas leak, which suggests that the neighbor noticed the leak.
"

Kedu ngwa ọgụ gbara ọkụ n'oge ụfọdụ n'oge mwakpo ahụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Uka**.

The passage states: ""Ngwa agha Uka dara dị ka ọ tụwara ya n’isi ony nke ise."" This clearly indicates that the Uka weapon was involved in the incident.
"
Kedu n'ime egwuregwu ndị a ka kọmitii Olympic kpebiri na ha agaghị etinye?,"The correct answer is **A: Squash**.

Here's why:

The passage states that squash, karate, and roller sports *nwakwara ịbanye* (tried to enter) the Olympic program, implying they were not chosen in this round. Rugby and Golf, on the other hand, were chosen to be further considered. Baseball and softball are mentioned as already having been excluded from the Olympics in 2005."
Kọmitii Olympic nke mba ụwa tozuru oke itinye n'ime egwuregwu ndị a na asọmpi a?,"The correct answer is **C: Rugby union**.

The passage states: ""Egwuregwu Rugbi, njikọ n'ahụ maka rugbi kpọmkwem, na gọlf ka ahọọrọ n'ime egwuregwu ise ndị ọzọ ka a ga atụle ma ọ ga eso na Olimpik."" This directly indicates that rugby union was among the sports considered for inclusion.
"
Afọ ole ka Arthur Guinness gbazitere na mbụ ụlọ ebe a na-eme mmanya St. James' Gate Brewery?,"The correct answer is **D: 9000**

The passage states that Arthur Guinness entered into an agreement to lease St. James' Gate Brewery for nine thousand years (afọ puku iteghete)."
"Ego ole ka Guinness na-eme kwa afọ, na nkezi?","The correct answer is not directly stated in the given text, but we can infer it.

The text states that Guinness makes ""more than euro iri nde (US$14.7 billion) ọnwa ọbụla"". Therefore the closest estimate is C: 14.

The actual answer will be 14.7 (billion USD) * 12 (months) which is 176.4. But this value is not among the choices
"
Achọtara nje H5N1 na mba ole nke European Union?,"The correct answer is **C: Asaa**

The passage states that France is the seventh country in Europe to be affected by H5N1. Since the question asks about the European Union, and all the listed countries are EU members, the answer is 7.
"
Ebee ka achọpụtara ikpe nje H5N1 kacha ọhụrụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Frans (France)**.

The passage states that the most recent case of H5N1 was discovered in France, near Lyon.
"
Olee mgbe Haiti nwetara ọrịa ikpeazụ tupu ndị ọrụ udo agbasa ya?,"The correct answer is **A: Oge nke 1800s**

The passage states: ""Tupu ndị agha abịarute, Haiti ezutebeghị nsogbu ndị metụtara ọrịa ahụ kemgbe oge ndị 1800."" This directly answers the question.
"
Kedu ụdị ihe mkpofu nyeere ọrịa ahụ aka ịgbasa site na ebe mbụ ya?,"The correct answer is **B: Ogige ndị UN**.

The passage states that untreated waste from the UN camp contaminated the Artibonite River, leading to the spread of cholera.
"
Kedu ihe gọọmentị Irish chọrọ ime?,"The correct answer is **B: Webata usoro iwu siri ike maka iji ọgwụ eme ihe**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the government is warning about the *need for parliament to address the situation* and that it's a public health and legal matter to *pass legislation as soon as possible*.
*   The Minister of Health expressed concerns about the *well-being of people taking advantage of short-term loopholes* in drug use regulations and the *legality of drug-related convictions* after recent changes in the laws.
*   All these statements indicate the need to make the rules stricter around drug use in Ireland."
Kedu ihe Ireland nyere iwu nwa oge?,"The correct answer is **D: Ọgwụ (Drugs)**.

The passage discusses the Irish government's concerns about the immediate need for legislation related to public health and criminal justice related to **drugs** that were temporarily legalized due to a legal change.
"
Kedu mmejọ ka a na-enyocha onye eboro ebubo?,"The correct answer is **C: Omume mpụ**.

The passage states that the man is being investigated for ""mmebi iwu"", which translates to ""criminal act"" or ""vandalism"". ""Omume mpụ"" also translates to criminal act, so it is the right answer. The passage specifies it was not for physical harm.
"
Kedu ihe onye a na-enyo enyo na-emeghị mgbe ọ gbanwere akara?,"The correct answer is **C: N'usoro imerụ ya ahụ (In order to damage it)**.

Here's why:

* The statement says ""Ihe ịrịba ama ahụ emerụghị ahụ kèahùrụanya"" which translates to ""The sign was not significantly damaged."" Therefore, the suspect did not aim to damage it significantly.
The other options are things the suspect DID do:

* **A:** ""Emere mgbanwe ahụ...iji gbanwee """"O"""" ahụ ka ọ gụọ mkpụrụedemede ntà """"e"""".""  This means they modified one of the letters.
* **B:** ""...n'iji akara nke udo na obi...gbanwee """"O"""" ahụ""  This means they used peace and heart signs.
* **D:** ""...Emere mgbanwe ahụ site n'iji tarpaulins achọrọ mma..."" This means they used decorated tarpaulins.
"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a ka onye nkuzi Bekee Karno na-eboghị ya ebubo, dabere na akụkụ akwụkwọ a?","The correct answer is **B: Inwe mmekọrịta na nwa akwụkwọ**

Here's why:

*   **A: Imebi iwu nwebiisinka:** The passage states, ""Ebobukwara ya ebubo ịda iwu nwebisiinka..."" which means he was accused of copyright infringement.
*   **C: Mmepụta nke mgbasa ozi na-enweghị ikike:** The passage mentions, ""Ọmụmụ nke Ọlọrọ ọhụrụ boro ya ebubo nke ibipụta ụmụ mgbasa ozi ahịa buru ibu n’ụmụ bọọsụ na-enweghị ikikere...""
*   **D: okwu rụrụ arụ na klas:** The passage says, ""...ekpesakwara na ọ na-ekwu okwu rụrụ arụ n'ụlọ nkụzi...""

The passage does not mention any accusations of Karno having a relationship with a student."
"Kedu onye Rolando Mendoza na-ejideghị, dabere na ebe a?","The correct answer is **B: Ndị ọrụ mmanye iwu** (Law enforcement officials).

The text states that Rolando Mendoza was a former police officer who took tourists hostage. The text also implies he held children and the elderly at one point. And lastly it says, ""The photographers eventually supplanted an old woman"" implying that Mendoza was no longer holding the old woman.
"
Kedu ndị ejidere na-akwadoghị n'ihu ọha na a tọhapụrụ ya na mbụ n'akụkụ a?,"The correct answer is **C: Onye lensman (Photographer)**.

The passage states: ""Ndị ose foto ahụ mechara nọchie otu agadi nwanyị dịka ọ gara ụlọmposi.""  This indicates that the photographers were the ones who later took the place of an elderly woman.

"
"Gịnị mere obere oge tupu ndị na-ege ntị amalite imeghachi omume na ihu igwe, dabere na akaụntụ Armand Versace?","The correct answer is **C: Ifufe siri ike**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that after 5 minutes the wind started to blow, and after another minute, the wind was blowing at 70 km/h. It continues that the rain starts, so it started with the wind and got progressively worse. The people were responding as they started getting blown around in the wind.
"
"Kedu mgbe ifufe kacha sie ike malitere, dịka Versace siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: Obere oge ka ihe ngosi malitere**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ka nkeji ise gachara e bidoro ihe ngosi a, ikuku ebido kuwe..."" which translates to ""Five minutes after the show started, the wind started blowing...""
* The passage also states: ""ka nkeji ọzọ gachara, ikuku a na-eru ọsọ kilomita 70 kwa awa..."" which translates to ""After another minute, the wind was blowing at 70 kilometers per hour..."" This confirms that the strong wind (70 km/h) started very shortly after the show began.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Na-eso mmiri ozuzo (Following the rain)** The wind started before the rain.
* **C: Mgbe nwanne ya nwanyị nwụsịrị (After his sister died)** The wind occurred before the deaths.
* **D: Tupu ka akụ mmiri igwe (Before the hail)** The wind is mentioned before the hail in the passage.
"
Oke ifufe ole dị ịrịba ama ka ekwuru na ọwụwa anyanwụ nke 35°W tupu Fred?,"The correct answer is **C: Abụọ**.

The passage states that Fred is the ""ajo ifufe nke ato enwegoro n’odida nke 35°W"" which translates to Fred is the third hurricane that has existed west of 35°W.

Therefore, it means that two major hurricanes were already recorded east of 35°W.
"
Olee ụzọ Fred si na-eme njem mgbe ọ dị nso n’agwaetiti Cape Verde?,"The text states that Fred is traveling in the ""northwest"" direction. Therefore, the answer is:

Here's why:

The passage states, ""...802.11n na arụ ọrụ ma na frikwensi nke 2.4Ghz na nke 5.0Ghz. Nke a ga-enye ya ohere ka dịrị na ndakọba nlaghachi azụ na 802.11a, 802.11b na 802.11g, **ma ọ bụrụhaala na isi ebe ahụ ụgbọigwe na-anọ nwere redìò abụọ.**""

This directly answers the question of what is required for backward compatibility with older standards like 802.11b.

Egwuregwu igwu mmiri ole n'egwuregwu Commonwealth ka onye nrite ọla edo n'Olimpik akwadoro ịsọ mpi?,"The passage states the swimmer competed in the 100m and 200m freestyle events *three times* at the Commonwealth Games. Therefore, the answer is B: Three.
"
Kedu ihe mere na onye mgbanye ọlaedo Olympic anọghị na-aṅụ ọgwụ maka ahụ mgbu ya?,"The correct answer is **D: N'egwuregwu Commonwealth, amachibidoro ya** (In the Commonwealth Games, they are prohibited).

The passage states ""...he has been unable to take the medication he needs to manage his pain as they are banned by the Games."" This directly indicates the reason he can't take the medication is because it is prohibited by the Games.
"
"Gịnị nwere ike ịkpata mgbagwoju anya banyere ọrụ ala ọma jijiji, ma ọ bụrụ na akụkụ ahụ ziri ezi?","The correct answer is **A: Mkpuchi igwe ojii nke gbara ọchịchịrị**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Akọrọ akụkọ igwe ojii n'enweghị ihe gbasara ha n'ihe omume ugwu mgbawa n'ụkwụ ugwu ahụ Urukpu igwe gosipụtara ohere nke a na-enweghị ike ịkọwa ma ntiwapụ o meela n'ezie."" This directly connects cloud cover to the uncertainty about volcanic activity and whether an eruption has occurred.
The passage is saying that because of the weather, it is difficult to determine if there has been activity.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Nlebanya sitere n'ụlọ ọrụ meteorological Icelandic:** The passage states that the Icelandic Meteorological Office reported no seismic activity, which is consistent with one agency's data.
*   **C: Nkọwa nke ala ọma jijiji gburugburu ụwa:** The United States Geological Survey also did not report seismic activity.
*   **D: A kọwo na mpaghara ndị ọzọ nke Iceland na-arụsi ọrụ ike:** The passage does not discuss other active regions of Iceland."
Kedu mgbe ekwuru na mgbanwe akụkụ mere na akụkụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Na Maachị 10**.

The passage states: ""Ala ọma jijiji ahụ dị ịrịba ama butere mgbanwe mere n'ụbọchị nke iri n'ọnwa Maachị n'ugwu ọwụwa anyanwụ nke isi ugwu mgbawa kaldera."" This directly indicates that the change occurred on March 10th.

Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a kacha kọwaa nyocha ọnwa?,"The correct answer is **B: Ọ dabara nke ọma ọdịda mkpọka**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the probe ""mechaa kpọkasịa na nso Ọwụwa Anyanwụ nke ọnwa,"" which means it crashed.
*   The other options are incorrect based on the passage. It crashed near the east pole, not the north pole. It was launched from an orbiter, not a rocket. It contained three scientific instruments, not two.
"
"Kedu usoro mgbochi ọrịa nke a ga-etinye n'ọnọdụ ikpeazụ, metụtara akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **A: Ogwu ogwu (Vaccination)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions ""Ọgwụ mgbochi ensefalitis"" which translates to ""Encephalitis vaccination"". The government has promised millions of these vaccinations.
*   The passage also mentions:
    *   sending pig catchers to affected regions.
    *   distributing mosquito nets.
    *   spraying pesticides.
*   However, the question specifically asks about a preventative measure that will be put in place in the future, affected the ""akụkụ ahụ"" (i.e. individuals). The passage mentioned that there are already people with the disease, so using the treatment for encephalitis would be too late to prevent the disease from spreading.
*   Mosquito nets and pig catchers are not methods that will have effects on the human body.

Vaccination is a preventative measure directly impacting the human body, and the passage indicates a future plan for widespread vaccination."
Kedu ka ọrịa si esi na anụmanụ agbasa ndị mmadụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Anwụnta (Mosquitoes)**.

The text specifically states: ""Ezi na ebu ọrịa ahụ, nke anwụnta na ebunyezi ndị mmadụ"" which translates to ""Pigs are the reservoir of the disease, which mosquitoes transmit to people"".

"Kedu mgbe e wepụrụ ahịrịokwu nke abụọ, dị ka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ ahụ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **B: N'afọ 2011**

The passage states that the bill passed both houses in 2011, and the amendment (deletion of the second sentence) occurred during that legislative process.
"
"""Kedu onye a gwara maka mwepu """"Panama Papers""""?""","The correct answer is **B: Mgbasa ozi** (Media).

The passage states that the Panama Papers were leaked to ""journalists in spring 2016.""

"Kedu onye e boro ebubo na ọ na-agba ọtụtụ ụlọ ọrụ na-ezochi ego, dị ka ndị nta akụkọ Britain si kọọ?","The correct answer is **C: German Bank**.

The passage states that *The Guardian*, a British newspaper, suggested that Deutsche Bank was responsible for about one-third of the 1200 shell companies used in the scheme.

Kedu n'ime ọnwụ mberede ụgbọ elu ndị a metụtara ọtụtụ mmadụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Na njem ya na Iran na-aga Armenia, ụgbọelu ahụ dara**

The passage states that the flight to Armenia killed 168 people, which is the highest number of fatalities mentioned.
"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị ihe kpatara ọtụtụ ihe mberede ụgbọ elu Iran nwere?,"The correct answer is **A: ụgbọ elu ndị agha na ụgbọ elu obodo emechiela**

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:**

    *   The plane crashes are happening due to old and poorly maintained aircraft.
    *   International sanctions limit the purchase of new aircraft.

*   **Explanation of the Options:**

    *   **A: ụgbọ elu ndị agha na ụgbọ elu obodo emechiela (Military and civilian aircraft are closed):** The passage doesn't state that the Iran government has closed any of the military or civilian aviation facilities. This is the main reason as to why this choice doesn't align with what is stated in the passage.
    *   **B: ụkọ ego maka ịzụrụ ụgbọ elu ọhụrụ (Lack of funds to purchase new aircraft):** The passage mentions international sanctions hindering the purchase of new aircraft which indirectly suggests this.
    *   **C: Mmachi na inweta ụgbọ elu ọhụrụ (Restrictions on obtaining new aircraft):** This is a direct consequence of the international sanctions mentioned in the passage.
    *   **D: ụgbọ elu nke nọ n'ọnọdụ ọjọọ (Aircraft in poor condition):** This is explicitly mentioned as a contributing factor to the accidents."
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị akụkụ nke akụkọ Iraq Study Group?,"The correct answer is **B: Mkpọsa na ịrị elu nke ime ihe ike na Iraq nwere ike kwụsị na kpọmkwem jikoro.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the Iraq Study Group warned that ""onweghị onye ga-ekwe nkwa na usoro ọbụla e jiri mee ihe na mba Aịrak ugbu a ga-akwụsị agha otu, ntolite ihe ike, maọbụ ndabanye n'ọgbaghara."" This directly contradicts option B, which implies that a specific approach *can* stop the violence.
*   The passage mentions the Study Group advocated for ""mgbanwe ụzọ ozigbo ozigbo"" which supports option A.
*   The passage mentions the Study Group suggested following ""usoro ọchịchị ọhụrụ tupu ọgwụgwụ afọ ị hụ na echebere oke ala Aịrak"" which supports option C.
*   The passage mentions the Study Group begins with ""ịkpọ oku ka onye ọbụla nwee mkpakọrịta ụka ma nwee nkwekọrịta n'Amerịka"" which supports option D.

Therefore, option B is the only one that is NOT part of the Iraq Study Group report as described in the passage."
Kedu n'ime ndụmọdụ ndị a ka Otu Ọmụmụ Iraq na-emeghị na akụkọ ya?,"Based on the provided text, the answer is **A: Ka e kwere nkwa ịkwụsị ime ihe ike na-abawanye ụba**.

Here's why:

*   The report explicitly states that ""onweghị onye ga-ekwe nkwa na usoro ọbụla e jiri mee ihe na mba Aịrak ugbu a ga-akwụsị agha otu, ntolite ihe ike, maọbụ ndabanye n'ọgbaghara"" (no one can guarantee that any of the methods currently being used in Iraq will stop war, escalating violence, or falling into chaos).

Let's look at the other options:

*   **B: Mgbanwe ozugbo na N'ezie (Immediate change in course):** The report ""na-akwado mgbanwe ụzọ ozigbo ozigbo"" (advocates for an immediate change of course).
*   **C: Iji oghe mkparịta ụka (To use open discussion):** The report ""bidoro site n'ịkpọ oku ka onye ọbụla nwee mkpakọrịta ụka"" (begins by calling for everyone to have open discussion).
*   **D: Mmalite nke mgbalị diplomatic ọhụrụ (Start of new diplomatic efforts):** The recommendation to ""wughachikwa mmekọrịta ọchịchị ha na agbataobi ha"" (rebuild their political relationships with their neighbors) implies new diplomatic efforts."
Kedu onye ndị uwe ojii chere na ọ bụ aka nri Provenzano?,"The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

The passage states: ""Ndị uwe ojii kwuru na Lo Pikolo bụ onye ka dị ike maka na ọ rụọrọla Provenzano ọrụ na Palemo dị ka onye nnọchiteanya..."" which translates to ""The police stated that Lo Piccolo was very powerful because he had worked for Provenzano in Palermo as a representative..."". This indicates that the police believed Lo Piccolo was someone who worked for Provenzano, essentially his right-hand man or representative.
"
"Kedu ihe kpatara ọnwụ Falcone, na-ekpe ikpe site na ozi dị na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **A: Ọ lara n'iyi na esemokwu Riina kpatara** (He died in the Riina conflict).

The passage states that Riina's war against the state took the lives of Mafia investigators Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino. Therefore, Falcone died as a result of the Riina conflict.
"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a Hitoshi Saito enweghị?,"The correct answer is **A: ọkaibe mba uwa ugboro abụọ** (international champion twice).

The passage states:

*   He was an Olympic **gold medalist twice** (C).
*   He was the head coach of the Japan Judo Federation training committee (B).
*   He was a former Olympic and world champion in judo (D).

The passage does not state Saito was an international champion twice, only that he was a world champion."
Iwasaki zere ikwe nkwa ebe?,"The correct answer is **A: Japan**.

The passage states that Iwasaki ran away from an arranged marriage and fled to Nepal, and was imprisoned in India. Therefore, he was avoiding something in Japan, his home country.
"
Kedu onye Iwasaki wakporo?,"The correct answer is **C: Nkịta**

The passage states that Iwasaki was attacked by a rabid dog.
"
Kedu mgbe Alonso gbachara ọsọ ya?,"The correct answer is **A: Ozugbo na-esochi mmebi wheel n'ihu Schumacher**.

The passage states that ""Michael Schumacher kwụsịrị ọsọ ya n’oge na-etoghị anya mgbe Alonso mesịrị..."". This indicates that Alonso retired from the race before Schumacher did. The reason for Schumacher's retirement was ""mmebi sọspenshọn n'ime ọtụtụ agha n'ime oge ọsọ ahụ"", not a loose front wheel. This supports option A's statement.
"
Ọ bụ n'ihi gịnị ka nchucha agbụrụ mbụ Schumacher mere?,"The correct answer is **D: Nsogbu nkwusioru na ụgbọ ala**.

The passage states that Michael Schumacher stopped racing ""n’ihi mmebi sọspenshọn n’ime ọtụtụ agha n’ime oge ọsọ ahụ.""
"
"Ọrụ onye ka ọ bụ, dabere na ngalaba ahụ, ikpebi mgbapụta onye ejidere?","The correct answer is **D: Kọmishọna ọkaikpe**.

The text states: ""Kọmishọna na ewepụta ụgwọ mgbapụta, ọbụrụ na ekwenye na ya..."" which translates to ""The Commissioner sets bail, if approved..."". This clearly indicates the Commissioner's role in determining bail.
"
"Kedu ihe a ga-ahapụrịrị ka ndị ejidere nwee ka ejidere ihe karịrị awa 24, dịka iwu mgbochi nwa oge siri dị n'akwụkwọ a?","The correct answer is **A: Ụgwọ ntọhapụ**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Judge Glynn issued a temporary restraining order to ensure the *immediate* release of detainees held over 24 hours who have not received the ""proper assessment from a magistrate.""
* The passage also mentions ""Kọmishọna na ewepụta ụgwọ mgbapụta, ọbụrụ na ekwenye na ya, ma hazie ụgwọ akwụkwọ onye jidere onye omekome gbara ya."" This means that *bail* (ụgwọ ntọhapụ) would need to be set and approved for someone to be held longer than 24 hours. If it is not set, then the person needs to be released.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ndụmọdụ ya na onye ọrụ njide:** While important for due process, the restraining order specifically focuses on assessment and bail.
* **C: Ọkaikpe Glynn gbara akwụkwọ ebubo:** Judge Glynn issued the restraining order, not the actual charges against the individual.
* **D: Anụ ahụ:** I believe this option is related to a mistranslation, but has no direct reference to the original text.
"
Kedu ihe ziri ezi ewepụrụ na akụkụ ahụ iji kọwaa kagbuo ọsọ ọsọ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Esemokwu na Iwu** and **C: nnukwu ọnụ ahịa**.

Here's why:

*   **C: nnukwu ọnụ ahịa**: The passage explicitly states that the election cancellation was partly to save the Afghan people from the huge financial costs.

*   **A: ihe ize ndụ na nchekwa**: The passage also states that the election cancellation was partly to save the Afghan people from the insecurities which come with elections

The option D is wrong because, although it mentions uncertainty in the law, the passage says that **ndị nnọchiteanya mbà kwuru na ha ahụghị ezigbi ihe mgbagwujuanya n’usoro iwu ndị Afghan iji kpebie n’usoro ntụziaka ahụ ezighị ezi** Which means they did not find loopholes in the Afghan law.

**Therefore, the best answers are A and C.**"
Gịnị kpatara na ndị nnọchi anya mba ụwa mechara kweta na ịgba ọsọ ahụ adịghị mkpa?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is:

**C: Usoro iwu edoghị anya n'ebe**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Ndị nnọchiteanya mbà kwuru na ha ahụghị ezigbi ihe mgbagwujuanya n’usoro iwu ndị Afghan iji kpebie n’usoro ntụziaka ahụ ezighị ezi."" This translates to ""International representatives said they did not find a clear ambiguity in Afghan law to decide that the directive was illegal."" This implies that the *lack* of clarity in the legal procedures was the issue.
"
Onye na-enye ọrụ iwu FATA?,"The correct answer is **B: Ndị nnọchi anya ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị**.

The passage states that the ""Ndị ọrụ ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị"" (Political Agents) appointed by the President of Pakistan were responsible for dispensing justice in FATA.
"
"""Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara """"Ndị nnọchi anya ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị"""" nke FATA bụ nke na-abụghị eziokwu?""","The correct answer is **A: Ha na-enye enyemaka iwu**.

Here's why:

*   **B: Onye isi ala Pakịstan họpụtara ha:** This is directly stated in the passage.
*   **C: Ha na-agbaso iwu Pakịstan:** The passage states they administer justice under Article 247 of the Constitution of Pakistan, so they are following Pakistani law.
*   **D: Ụfọdụ ebe nọ kpamkpam n'okpuru ha:** The passage states they have ""absolute power"" in those areas, implying these areas are entirely under their control.
*   **A: Ha na-enye enyemaka iwu:** The passage mentions they give government jobs and manage justice, which is significantly different from providing legal aid/assistance. There is nothing in the passage suggesting that this is part of their duties."
Kedu ihe nrite ka akpọrọ Emma Stone?,"The correct answer is **C: Onye na-eme ihe nkiri kachasị mma** (Best Actress). The passage states that Emma Stone was nominated for the Best Actress award.
"
Kedu ihe nsọpụrụ fim ahụ enwetaghị nhọpụta maka?,"The correct answer is **B: Mmetụta Ọhụụ mara mma**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions nominations for:

    *   Best Actor (Ryan Gosling)
    *   Best Actress (Emma Stone)
    *   Best Picture
    *   Director
    *   Cinematography
    *   Costume Design
    *   Film Editing
    *   Original Song (two songs)
    *   Production Design
    *   Sound Editing
    *   Sound Mixing
    *   Original Screenplay

* The other options can be found in the given paragraph, therefore, Option B is the only option that is NOT mentioned in the paragraph.

"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a ka na-agba ọsọ mgbe ala ọma jijiji ahụ gasịrị?,"The correct answer is **D: Ụlọ ọrụ ike na Niigata**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Igwe ọkụ niile nọ n'ụlọọrụ Shika dị na Hokuriku** - The passage states that the Shika plant is ""closed,"" implying that the power plants are not running.
*   **B: Ọdụ ụgbọ elu Ishikawa** - The passage states the Ishikawa airport was closed.
*   **C: Ọrụ ụgbọoloko niile** - The passage says train services were suspended in the affected areas, so not all services were running.
*   **D: Ụlọ ọrụ ike na Niigata** - The passage specifically says that the Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear power plant in Niigata Prefecture is operating ""normally""."
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a ka ala ọma jijiji ahụ mebiri, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **C: ụzọ ụfọdụ**.

The passage states: ""O mebiri ụfọdụ ụzọ, kwụsịtụ njem ụgbọ oloko n'ebe ndị o metụtara, ma ọdụ ụgbọelu Ishikawa ka mechiri emechi.""

While the passage mentions the airport and train services were affected, it specifically states that ""ụfọdụ ụzọ"" (some roads) were damaged. Thus, option C is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
"Kedu n'ime isiokwu ndị a na-ekwughị n'akwụkwọ akụkọ ahụ, dịka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **B: mgbọrọgwụ nke esemokwu nke 1967**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Atụmatụ ọdịnihu maka Jerusalem:** The passage explicitly mentions ""ihe akọrọ ọdịnihu Jerusalem nke dị nsọ nye mba abụọ ahụ.""
*   **C: e nwere ndị agha nọ na ndagwurugwu:** The passage discusses the presence of Israeli troops in the Jordan Valley and the disagreement over how long they should stay.
*   **D: Esemokwu n'oke oke:** The first sentence mentions that the document addresses border disputes and land claims based on pre-1967 borders.

The passage focuses on the land claims as they *were* before the 1967 war, and the disagreements now. However, it does not discuss the *causes* or *origins* of the 1967 war itself. That would be discussing the roots of the conflict."
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị ihe Palestine chọrọ?,"The correct answer is **B: ndị agha ka dị na ndagwurugwu Jọdan**.

Here's why:

*   **A: dabere na ọnọdụ tupu agha maka oke ala:** The passage explicitly states that the document would address the territorial claims the Palestinians want based on pre-1967 borders. So, this is something they *do* want.
*   **C: Azịza nke ọdịnihu Jerusalem:** The passage mentions that the future of Jerusalem is covered in the document.
*   **D: Ndagwurugwu Jọdan nwere ọnụnọ ndị agha afọ ise:** The passage says the PA (Palestinian Authority) wants the military presence in the Jordan Valley for only five years. So, this is something they *do* want.
*   **B: ndị agha ka dị na ndagwurugwu Jọdan:** The passage states that Israel wants a military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years, so the Palestinians do not want this."
Kedu obodo Ma gara ụlọ akwụkwọ iwu?,"Correct Answer: A: obodo America

The passage states that Ma attended ""Mahadum Ikpe nke Havad"" which translates to ""Harvard Law School"". Harvard Law School is located in the United States, therefore the answer is A: obodo America.
"
"Dị ka paragraf ahụ si kwuo, ọ̀tụ̀tụ̀ akabatara mmeri nhoputa ndi ochichi Ma kedu mba?","D: Óbodo Chaịna

Explanation: The paragraph states that Ma won the election on a platform of increasing relations with mainland China. This implies that the election was for a position within a country or territory separate from mainland China, but seeking closer ties with it. From the context, the passage is referring to an election in Taiwan (which is not explicitly mentioned but is highly implied) where closer ties with mainland China is a significant political issue. The Chinese name ""Ma"" suggests a Taiwanese background. Therefore, the election was held in a territory that is separate from mainland China but could be described as ""obodo Chaina"" depending on one's political views. Other options are incorrect because the passage did not imply the election took place in the United States, Hong Kong, or the United Kingdom."
"Ònye bụ onye were Carolyn Wilson n'ọrụ tupu ọ pụọ n'obodo, dị ka akọwara n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **C: Nke a OHA**.

The passage states ""...Karolin Wịlsịn onye ụlọ ọrụ OHA eburula ego ha kwụnyegoro si n'obodo larie."" This directly translates to ""...Carolyn Wilson who **the OHA company** took their down payment and disappeared from the city."" Therefore, the OHA is the organization that employed her.
"
Onye nọ n'ọkwa nke anọ n'asọmpi ndị ọkwọ ụgbọ ala nwere asọmpi anọ fọdụrụ n'afọ?,"The correct answer is **D: Bowyer**

Here's the breakdown of how we know:

*   The passage states: ""Dịka onye nke atọ, Hamlin ji pọyịnt iri abụọ nọrọ n'azụ, mana o ji ise nọrọ n'ihu Bowyer."" This means Bowyer is directly behind Hamlin, and therefore in fourth place."
Isi isi ole Kahne nwere na asọmpi ndị ọkwọ ụgbọ ala ka agbachara agbachara ahụ aka n'akwụkwọ a?,"The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The passage states: ""Kahne na Truex, Jr. bụ ndị nke ise na isii n'otu n'otu ma nwee pọyịnt 2,220 na 2,207."" This directly indicates Kahne had 2,220 points.
"
"Ugboro ole ka ndị mmadụ hụla ka meteorite dara bụ nke mechara pụta na Mars, dị ka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ na-ekwu?","The correct answer is **B: ugboro ise**.

The passage states, ""Ekweere na nke a bụ oge nke ise n'akụkọ ihe mere eme ndị mmadụ na-ahụ ihe emechaara chọpụta site na nyochapụta ihe kemịstrị na ọbụ ihe si n'ụwa Maas daa n'ụwa anyị."" This translates to, ""It is believed that this is the fifth time in history that people have seen an object fall that was later identified through chemical analysis as coming from Mars and falling to our planet."""
"Kedu ihe bụ eziokwu gbasara okwute ndị a chọpụtara na ha sitere na martian, dị ka akọwara n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **D: Mmadụ 34 n'ime ha nọ**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Achọpụtara ha niile n'oge ịsa ahụ meteor nke July:** The passage states that fifteen of the Martian meteorites are said to be from a meteorite shower last July. It doesn't say ALL of them were found during that shower.

*   **B: 24,000 n'ime ha bụ mkpokọta:** The passage states that of the 24,000 known meteorites, about 34 are Martian.

*   **C: Ha dị $11,000 ọnụ karịa ọla edo:** The passage states that Martian meteorites sell for US$11,000 to $22,500 per ounce, which is about ten times the price of gold. This doesn't mean they are only $11,000 more than gold, but that their price range starts at that amount.

*   **D: Mmadụ 34 n'ime ha nọ:** The passage states that among the meteorites that have fallen to Earth, only about 34 have been confirmed to have Martian origins. Therefore, this is the correct answer."
Schumacher lara ezumike nká mgbe?,"The correct answer is **A: Mgbe ihe mberede Felipe Massa mere**.

The passage states that Schumacher was ready to replace the injured Felipe Massa. This implies that he had already retired *before* Massa's accident, so his retirement preceded the accident. Therefore, the other options do not directly correspond to the question. The text says he retired in 2006. The accident with Massa happened in 2009.
"
Mgbe Massa merụrụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **D: N'ihu nke oge 2009** (In front of the 2009 season).

The passage states that Massa was injured during the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix, meaning it happened *during* the 2009 season, thus ""in front of the end of the 2009 season.""
"
"Mmetụta dị aṅaa ka nhazi ahụ ga-enwe na AOL, dịka akụkụ nke akwụkwọ ahụ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **C: Microsoft na Yahoo ga-enwe ndị ọrụ na-emegide AOL n'ihe gbasara ọnụọgụ**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the combined user base of Yahoo! and Microsoft will exceed the user base of AOL. This directly implies that Microsoft and Yahoo! will have more users than AOL.
*   The other options are not supported by the provided text."
"Dị ka ndokwa ọhụrụ ahụ si dị, olee nke pụrụ ịkwụsị?","The correct answer is **C: Nnwere onwe maka AOL itolite ahịa n'ọsọ nke ya (Freedom for AOL to grow the market at its own pace)**

**Explanation**

The premise (P) states that AOL's ability to move and improve the IM market as it wishes is now threatened because of its acquisition of a large audience in the United States. It says that with this support in place, this freedom might end. This ""freedom"" refers to AOL's independence to grow the market as it sees fit.

Ole ndị e merụrụ na mwakpo a na-abụghị ndị uwe ojii?,"The passage states that ""more than twenty other people"" were injured, and that ""nineteen of the injured were police officers"". This means that at least one injured person was not a police officer.

Let's analyze the question and passage:

*   **Question:** How many people were injured in the attack who were NOT police officers?
*   **Passage:**
    *   ""more than twenty other people"" were injured.
    *   19 of those injured were police officers.

If ""more than twenty"" people were injured, that means at least 21 were injured. If 19 were police officers, then at most 21 - 19 = 2 were not police. However, the passage says ""more than twenty"". If there were 22 injuries, then 22-19 = 3 would be non-police.

Since the answers are limited, and we know at least one person other than the police were injured, and nineteen injured were police, if there were 21 or more injured, that means 2 or more non-police were injured.

Therefore, the best answer is **B: 2** because it is consistent with the statement ""more than twenty other people were injured"" and also with the information that nineteen injured are police officers. It implies that there were 21 injured, 19 being police and 2 being non-police. If 22 or more were injured, then the number of non-police injuries would be more than 2, so we pick 2 because it fits the information, ""more than twenty"". If the answer were 1, that would contradict the phrase ""more than twenty"". Therefore, the closest and more probable answer is **2**.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{B}$"
Onye mere ka amara onye a na-enyo enyo na mwakpo ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ndị uwe ojii**.

The passage states: ""Ndị uwe ojii sị na ha na-enyo otu onye a na-ebo ebubo na ọ bụ onye agha nnupuisi Daesh (ISIL) dịka onye mere mwakpo ahụ."" which translates to ""The police said they suspect a person accused of being a Daesh (ISIL) rebel fighter as the perpetrator of the attack"". This clearly indicates the police are the ones identifying the suspected perpetrator.

"Ònye, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si kwuo, gbahapụrụ ịgba ọsọ na-eso rịzọlt caucus?","The correct answer is **B: Bachmann**.

The passage states: ""Bakman, onye meriri Ntuliaka Ames Strọ n'Ọgọọst, kpebiri ịkwụsị kampen ya."" This indicates that Bachmann decided to end her campaign after the caucus results.

"
Kedu ụdị ntugharị a na-egosi site na nkọwa ụlọ ọrụ nke mmemme ahụ?,"The best answer is **B: Geeky**.

Here's why:

*   **""Old Time Radio Shows of the New Vice About Books and Awesomeness!""**: The title itself sounds like something a person interested in niche subjects and enthusiastic about them would make.

*   **Reference to TogiNet and AstroNet**: Focusing on internet radio stations and their sub-divisions indicate a level of interest beyond the mainstream.

*   **Focus on Voice Actors**: While voice acting is a common practice, people with a geeky hobby like to be interested in this side of producing an episode.

The other options are not as well suited:

*   **Onye nkịtị (Ordinary/Normal):** The show's title and subject matter suggest something more niche than ordinary.

*   **Old school:** While it refers to old time radio shows, this doesn't capture the enthusiasm for niche interests displayed in the name and subject matter.

*   **Isiokwu mpaghara (Local topic):** The show initially featuring voice actors from East Texas does indicate some degree of local focus, but the content described is not just local in nature, more so that the actors are from this area."
Kedu ozi David Headley chọpụtara nke mechara kwado mwakpo ndị otu ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ozi** (Information).

The passage states that ""Ọchịchọ na mkpokọta ozi nke David Headley enyerela aka ime ka arụmarụ ahụ nwee ike..."" which translates to ""David Headley's reconnaissance and information gathering helped make the attacks possible..."" Therefore, the information he gathered was crucial in enabling the attacks.

The passage states: ""Ndị mwakpọ Mumbaị ahụ jiri **ụgbọmmiri** wee bịa na Nọvemba 26, 2008..."" (The Mumbai attackers came by **boat** on November 26, 2008...)
"
Kedu n'ime ndị a kacha kọwaa nsonaazụ Brisbane Open n'etiti Raonic na Nadal kwuru n'amaokwu a?,"The correct answer is **A: Raonic meriri Nadal**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Ọ dara n’oge na-adịghị anya megide Raonic na Mmepe Brisbane ahụ."" This translates to ""He soon fell against Raonic in the Brisbane Open."" ""Fell against"" means Nadal lost to Raonic.
*   The rest of the information discusses Nadal's statistics in the game and his overall feelings, but the direct result mentioned is his loss to Raonic."
"Kedu ihe bụ ọnọdụ egwuregwu Nadal na Raonic mgbe ozi mbụ gasịrị, dịka akụkụ nke akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **B: Nadal nwetara 76 akara**

The passage states: ""Nadal nwere 88% n’egwuregwu ahụ iji merie na 76 n’ọrụ izizi."" This translates to: ""Nadal had an 88% chance to win the game and 76% on the first serve."" Therefore, Nadal getting 76 points on the first serve is the correct interpretation.

"
Ederede a na-ekwu na mgbasa ozi akụkọ gba ọtọ agaghị adị ebe ọzọ?,"The correct answer is **C: Ụlọ ihe nkiri nkiri (Movie Theaters)**

Here's why:

*   The text states that the news broadcasts will be available on television, the web, and mobile devices.
*   It does not mention movie theaters as a medium for this news."
Ndị egwuregwu ole na-emezughị Giant Slalom?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

The passage states: ""45 n'ime skiers 117 nọ na Giant Slalom dara isonye na ndị gbatara ihe n'egwuregwu ahụ."" This directly translates to ""45 out of the 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to finish the race.""
"
Kedu n'ime okwu ndị a kacha kọwaa ka asọmpi asọmpi ahụ siri pụta?,"Let's analyze each option based on the provided text:

*   **A: Carpenado meriri n'ọsọ nke abụọ n'ihu onye skier Hungarian:** This is incorrect. The text states she was *behind* Gyöngyi Dani (the Hungarian skier) by 1:09.02 in the Giant Slalom.

*   **B: Na Giant Slalom, ndị na-agba ọsọ 45 akwụsịghị ọsọ ha:** The text states that 45 skiers *failed* to finish, so they *didn't* finish the race. This means they *didn't stop* running. This is correct and it's what the text refers to.

*   **C: Nnukwu Slalom hụrụ ka ndị skiers gwụchara karịa Slalom:** We know 117 skiers started the Giant Slalom, and 45 failed to finish, meaning 117-45=72 finished. For Slalom, we know 116 skiers participated and 36 ""got the same score,"" but it's not stated those are the only people who finished. Thus, we don't have enough information to confirm if more skiers finished in Giant Slalom than in Slalom.

*   **D: Carpenado batara na ọnụọgụ iri na Slalom:** The text states she placed in the top ten in the Giant Slalom, *not* the Slalom. In Slalom she got the same score in her first run as 36/116 other skiers, so that is not a top 10 spot.

Therefore, the best answer is **B**."
Ndị NBA kpebiri ịkwụsị nke n'ime ihe ndị a?,"The correct answer is **A: Oge bọọlụ basketbọl** (The basketball season).

The passage states that the NBA suspended its basketball season. Therefore, the decision was to stop the basketball season.
"
"Kedu ihe kpaliri ndị NBA na-echegbu onwe ha banyere nje a, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **D: Onye ọkpụkpọ Utah Jazz nwere ule dị mma**.

"
"N'egwuregwu Capitals-Thrashers, onye nyere goolu 60th ya n'afọ?","The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

The passage states that Ovechkin's second goal of the night was his 60th of the season.
"
Kedu mgbe gọọmentị kwesịrị inyere Northern Rock Bank aka?,"The correct answer is **D: N'etiti nsogbu nnyefe ego**.

The passage states: ""Northern Rock chọburu nkwado maka mkpughepụ ya n'oge ọdụdọ nyefee ego mgbazinye ụlọ dị ọnụ ala na 2007.""  This means they needed help *during* the subprime mortgage crisis.
"
"Kedu n'ime okwu ndị a gbasara mmekọrịta Virgin Group na Northern Rock bank bụ eziokwu, dịka akụkụ nke a si dị?","The correct answer is **D: Mgbe emechara ụlọ akụ ahụ mba, Virgin Group nyere onyinye izizi ya maka ya**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Richard Branson of Virgin made a bid for Northern Rock *before* it was nationalized, and that bid was rejected. It then states Virgin only bought the ""good bank"" *after* it was split, and *after* it was nationalized. This makes D inaccurate, as the *first* bid, as suggested by the other option, happened before nationalization.
*   **A:** The passage says the opposite. Virgin *didn't* buy the asset management company.
*   **B:** The passage says Virgin bought only the ""good bank"" after the nationalization.
*   **C:** The passage says the *government* provided emergency support, not Virgin Group.
"
"Kedu obodo nke mbinye aka na nkwekọrịta ihu igwe Kyoto na-emetụta, dị ka e gosiri n'akụkụ a?","The correct answer is **A: Steeti America**.

The passage states that the United States was the only developed country that did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Australia is also mentioned as not ratifying it, but the question asks which country is *affected* by the Kyoto Protocol, making the USA the correct answer in the context of the question. The passage mentions India and China as not being held to the same emissions limits.
"
Kedu ihe gọọmentị mbụ Australia tụrụ ụjọ na nkwado Kyoto ga-emebi?,"The correct answer is **B: Akụnụba obodo**

The passage states that the former Australian government refused to ratify Kyoto, saying that ""it would damage the **country's economy** due to its heavy reliance on coal exports.""
"
Kedu mmemme ka ewetere ndị na-agba ụta n'ụzọ?,"The correct answer is **A: Mmemme nke Sporting Shooters Association of Australia**.

The passage explicitly states that the shooters were employed under the hunting program *of* the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia. The program of hunting comes from the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia. The other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** While park and heritage management is mentioned, the shooters' program specifically comes from the SSAA.
*   **C:** NPWS is involved, but it is the SSAA program that the shooters are under.
*   **D:** While accurate, it is a bit more specific, when the exact name of the association's program has been given."
Kedu n'ime okwu ndị a bụ nke na-abụghị eziokwu gbasara nnwale mgbochi ahụhụ?,"The statement that is NOT true based on the paragraph is **A: A nwalere mmemme ahụ naanị otu ugboro, yabụ na enyochaghị ya**.

The passage states that rangers *monitored* the shooters closely and *considered* whether the trial was effective. This implies an evaluation process was in place, even if it was during the first trial. The text doesn't say the program was only tested once, only that it was the first trial. The fact that it was being monitored to see if it was effective indicates an intent to evaluate.
"
Ebee ka a chọtara nkewa ahụ dịka ederede ahụ si kọwaa?,"The correct answer is **B: N'ọkpụkpụ**

The text states ""Ma adabere n'ọkpụkpụ a, ọputara na..."" which translates to ""Based on this bone, it means that..."". This clearly indicates that the split was found in a bone.

Here's why:

The passage states that the controller uses sensors positioned *next to the TV* to detect its location. To control movement in the game, players need to move the controller. However, the question is asking about the initial positioning to allow the motion to work. This is the same as the sensors that are next to the tv.
"
Kedu ihe emepụtara ka ọ yie ebe nchekwa Televison?,"The correct answer is **B: onye njikwa maka Nintendo Revolution**.

The passage states that the controller for the Nintendo Revolution ""yiri rimotu onyonyo"" (resembles a TV remote).

Kedu ihe na-efu na akụkọ akụkọ Xinhua kacha ọhụrụ?,"The correct answer is **A: A tụrụ ụgbọ elu ahụ egwu bọmbụ**.

Here's why:

*   The prompt states: ""Ụlọ ọrụ mgbasa ozi ndị Chaịna n’oge mbụ kọrọ maka ụgbọ elu a chọrọ izuru."" (Early reports were about hijacking)
*   It then states: ""Ozi ndị ọzọ mechara bata kwuru na ụgbọ elu ahụ natara iyi ụjọ gbasara ogbunigwe ya mere o ji wee lọghachi Afganistan, lotuo na Kandahar."" (Later reports said bomb threat, returned to Afghanistan, landed in Kandahar)

Therefore, the **earlier** Xinhua report focused on a hijacking, and the later reports contained the additional information about the bomb threat, which led to the landing in Kandahar. Therefore, the bomb threat was not in the earlier account.
"
Kedu ihe na-efu na akụkọ mbụ nke ụlọ ọrụ ọhụrụ Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **D: A tụrụ ụgbọ elu ahụ egwu bọmbụ**

The initial report from Chinese media outlets (as stated in P) only mentioned a suspected hijacking.  The later information clarified that the plane received a bomb threat, leading to its return to Afghanistan. Therefore, the bomb threat is the information missing from the first report.
"

Sara Danius stated that the committee would stop trying to contact Bob Dylan. This is stated in the passage: ""...na ha ahapụlarị mbọ ha na-agba inweta ya.""
"
Onye na-enweghị ike ịchọta?,"Based on the passage, the Nobel committee (specifically Sara Danius) was unable to reach **Bob Dylan**.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Bob Dylan**.
"
"""Ònye kwuru na nkwa ahụ bụ """"isi nzọụkwụ""""?""","The correct answer is **C: Gordon Johndroe**.

The passage states: ""O mepụtaara stampụ karịrị 1,000 maka Swidin na mba 28 ndị ọzọ."" This directly translates to ""He created more than 1,000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries.""

"Kedu ihe nwere ike ịbụ ihe kpatara nkwụsị na-aga n'ihu site na ikuku tank, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **C: Mgbatị okpomọkụ** (Thermal expansion).

The passage states: ""Dị ka n’ehihie Wenezdee, ụmụ oghere ikuku tankị ahụ ka na-ehi ehi o nwere ike site na ebumibu n’ihi ekpomọkụ n’ime tankị ahụ."" This directly indicates that thermal expansion due to the temperature inside the tank is causing the venting.
"

The passage states that ""Ọkụ ọnyụnyụ sochitere nlekwa a na emechite anya n'ụlọ ihe gbasara ọkụ mere ka valvụ enyemaka mepee mmanụ wee gbabiga oke n'akụkụ ebe mgbapụta mmanụ nke itolu Fọt Griili."" This directly says that a power surge due to facility maintenance caused the relief valve to open.
"
Kedu ka mmiri siri dị ugbu a na Ward nke itoolu?,"The correct answer is **C: Elu-elu**.

The passage states that the Ninth Ward experienced floodwaters up to 20 feet during Hurricane Katrina. It also mentions a potential 6-inch surge exceeding a damaged flood barrier. While the 6-inch surge is a possibility, the main point is the historical high flood level during Katrina. Therefore, ""elu-elu"" best describes the relative water height in the Ninth Ward.
"
"Na Ward nke itoolu, gịnị mere n'oge Hurricane Katrina?","The correct answer is **C: Iju mmiri nke dị ụkwụ 20 dị**.

The passage states that the Ninth Ward ""hụrụ oke ide mmiri ruru ihe dị ka feet iri abụọ n'oge Ajọ Ifufe Katrina."" The other options are incorrect based on the information provided in the passage.

Kedu n'ime okwu ndị a bụ ụgha ka Hamilton siri kwuo?,"The answer is **None of the above**.

Here's why:

"Kedu mgbe a tụrụ anya na Tropical Cyclone Gonu ga-aga n'ihu na-akụda mmụọ, dị ka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ si kwuo?","The passage states: ""Ka ọ na-erule mbido taa, ikuku dị ihe dịka 83km/awa, ma a na-atụkwa anya na ọ ga-eme ka ọ na-agbada."" This means it is expected to weaken *after* its wind speed reached 83 kph.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Mgbe ọsọ ifufe gbadara ruo 83 kph**.
"
"Mgbe Tropical Cyclone Gonu kachasi ike, kedu ka ifufe siri were ọsọ ọsọ?","The correct answer is **B: 240 kilomita kwa elekere**.

The passage states: ""Na nkacha elu ya, Ajọ ifufe Ebe okpomọkụ Gonu...rutere ifufe nọgidesịrị ike nke kilomita 240 kwa awa (maịlị 149 kwa awa).""  This directly indicates the maximum sustained wind speed.

Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a tozuru oke dị ka njirimara Karenia brevis?,"The correct answer is **B: O nwere ike ime ka akwara ndị mmadụ ghara ịrụ ọrụ.**

Here's why:

*   **A: Algae nke otu ụdị:** The passage states Karenia brevis is a ""single-celled organism"", not a multi-celled one. This contradicts this option.
*   **B: O nwere ike ime ka akwara ndị mmadụ ghara ịrụ ọrụ:** The passage states that the algae ""produces a neurotoxin that can shut down nerves in both humans and fish."" This directly supports option B.
*   **C: Ọ nwere ọtụtụ sel:** The passage states Karenia brevis bụ ""otu single-celled organism"" (""single-celled organism""), so this is incorrect.
*   **D: Nke a na-eme ndammana:** While red tides themselves happen naturally, the question is about *characteristics of Karenia brevis*, not about red tides in general. The passage focuses on the toxins produced by the organism itself.
"
Kedu otu n'ime ihe ndị a Karena Brevis na-enweghị ike ime?,"The correct answer is **B: Na-abawanye nke ọma na ọnụọgụ n'ọnọdụ ọ bụla**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states Karenia brevis multiplies rapidly when **good conditions** are present. It doesn't say they thrive in all conditions. The organism will only multiply when environmental factors like salinity, light, temperature, pH, oxygen level, and nutrients is perfect.
*   The other options are directly supported by the passage:
    *   A: ""Algee na-emepụta nsi nke akwara ozi nke nwere ike ịgbanyụ akwara na ma mmadụ ma azụ."" (Neurotoxin can paralyze nerves in both humans and fish.)
    *   C: ""Nke a nwere ike imetụta ndị mmadụ site n'ikuru mmiri o metụtara nke oke ikuku na ebili bugara n'ikuku."" (Affects humans by inhaling contaminated water.)
    *   D: ""Algee na-emepụta nsi nke akwara ozi"" (Algae produce neurotoxins.)

Therefore, Karenia brevis does **not** increase effectively in number in all conditions, making B the correct answer."

Here's why:

The passage states that Felicia WAS a category 4 hurricane but weakened to a tropical depression.  It did NOT start as a tropical depression and then become a category 4 hurricane. The passage clearly stated that Felicia bụ bu oke ifufe nke udi 4, nke pụtara Felicia USED to be a category 4 hurricane. The keyword is ""bu"" which means ""was"".

The passage clearly states that the Il-76 is an aircraft (ụgbọelu).
"

The passage states: ""Na 1989 ọ nyere aka na mmepụta The Simpsons ya na Brooks na Groening, ọ bụ ya hụrụ maka ịwe ndị otu edemede mbụ nke ihe nkiri a."" This translates to ""In 1989 he helped with the production of The Simpsons with Brooks and Groening, and he was responsible for hiring the initial writing team for the show.""
"
"Onye na-ezigara ya ozi agbamume, ka Fluke siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **D: Enwere ma nwoke ma nwanyị**.

This translates to ""She arrived at this decision because of the many words of support she received from both men and women who said that contraception was appropriate.""

Therefore, Fluke received encouragement from both men and women.
"

The passage directly states, ""Ka anyị madebere, sọ otu ụwa na-egosi ọtụtụ ike karịa Taịtan, ma aha ya bụ Earth"" which implies that Earth is the planet described that is most like one that contains life."
Kedu ụwa a chọtara nke nwere osimiri na ọdọ mmiri ndị nwere mmiri mmiri na-agafe agafe?,"The correct answer is **D: Saturn**.

Kedu n'ime nchọpụta ndị a na-enweghị njikọ na ịchọta nku?,"The correct answer is **D: na-egosi na ihe ka ọtụtụ n'ime dinosaur nwere ábụbà**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the discovery shows that ""at least, some dinosaurs had feathers."" It doesn't generalize this to say that *most* dinosaurs had feathers.

The other options are all directly related to the discovery of feathers on the dinosaur tail:

*   **A: The hue nke anụ aji:** The passage discusses the coloration of the feathers.
*   **B: N'ịmara na anaghị arụ ọrụ maka ụgbọ elu:** The structure of the feathers suggested they were not used for flight.
*   **C: Ịghọta mmalite nke feathers:** The feather structure provided insights into the evolution of feathers in birds."

The passage states that ZMapp is an *antibody*, not a vaccine. The rest of the options (B, C, and D) are all explicitly mentioned or implied in the passage.
"
Kedu otu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a kpọtụrụ aha kacha mma chịkọta nnwale PALM?,"The correct answer is **C: ZMapp rụrụ ọrụ dị ka mmalite ikpe**

The passage explicitly states: ""Na nnwale PALM, eji ZMapp mere ihe nruba ama, nke a putara na ndi sayentist jiri ya mee baseline tunyere ogwugwo ato ozo."" This translates to: ""In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as a control, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline to compare three other treatments."" Therefore, option C is the best summary of ZMapp's role in the PALM trial.
"
Ebe ndị ọkà mmụta sayensị kwenyere na mgbawa ọhụrụ ahụ ga-enwe mmetụta kasịnụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Mba ndị na-emepe emepe** (Developing countries).

*   The passage explicitly states that lobate scarps appear relatively young (""not very long ago""), which contradicts the idea that they are ancient.
*   The other options are supported by the passage:
    *   B: Lobate scarps ""na-egosi na ihe mmegharị ala kpatara ya eteghị aka omere"" - implies geological activity.
    *   C: The passage mentions that the lobate scarps might be from the Moon gradually shrinking
    *   D: The passage says ""Skap ndị a ka achọpụtara gburugburu ọnwa"", so it means it has been discovered."
Kedu nkọwa nke ọdịdị ala na-akwado nkwuputa nke akụkụ ahụ na ọnwa na-enwe ọrụ geologic?,"The correct answer is **D: Ọ bụ naanị n'oge na-adịbeghị anya ka arụrụ ala ahụ**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the lobate scarps ""appear relatively fresh,"" meaning they were formed recently. This recent formation suggests ongoing (or recent) geologic activity.
*   The other options are not supported by the information given in the passage."
"Kedu ihe na-agaghị aga n'ihu ruo mgbe ebubo ahụ, dị ka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **A: Okwu agbakwunyere**

The passage states: ""Ụlọ ọrụ Krawn, nke nọ n'isi amamikpe, agwala ndị nta akụkọ na ha agaghị ekwu okwu gbasara okwu akpụ n'ọnụ ozo ruo mgbe amara mmadụ ikpe.""

This translates to: ""The Crown Office, which is in charge of the prosecution, has told journalists that they will not comment on the case any further until the person is convicted.""

Therefore, ""okwu agbakwunyere"" (further comments) will not proceed until the case is resolved.
"
Kedu ihe akụkụ ahụ edepụtaghị dị ka mbipụta dị ugbu a maka ndị na-edochi anya?,"The correct answer is **D: Ice agbaze**

    *   **Ọnụ ọgụgụ nke ice** (Volume of ice)
    *   **Oke nke ice** (Thickness of ice)
*   **P does not mention**:
    *   **Ice agbaze** (Ice melt)

Therefore, ice agbaze is what is not mentioned as a current issue hindering rescuers."
Kedu ihe ọzọ na-egbochi ọrụ nnapụta ma e wezụga ice?,"The correct answer is **B: Burugburu ebe obibi**.

The passage mentions ""ọnọdụ ihu igwe dị egwu"" (severe weather conditions) in addition to the ice as hindering rescue efforts. ""Burugburu ebe obibi"" translates to ""environmental conditions"", which encompasses the weather.

"
Roberts chere na isiokwu ahụ bụ omume rụrụ arụ nke na-agaghị atụle?,"The correct answer is **B: ikpe na Roe v. Wade**

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""O mechekwara kwugharịa ihe o kwuru mbụ, na ikpe Roe v. Wade bụ """"iwu ala ekpebigoro"""", na-akọwa etu o si dị mkpa ka mkpebi Ụlọ ikpe kachasị elu bụrụ agbanwe agbanwe.""

This shows Roberts addressed Roe v. Wade.
"

The passage states: ""E dochiri ụzọ abụọ dị ọkụ iji rụtụrụ mbara igwe n'otu abalị."" This directly says the lights were pointing up towards the sky (mbara igwe).
"
"Kedu mgbe a na-arụ ụlọ elu ọhụrụ dị n'ebe ahụ, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si dị?","The correct answer is **D: Owuwu ka na-aga n'ihu**.

The passage states that ""Owuwu ụlọ ruru igwe ise na-aga n'ihu n'ebe ọrụ"" which translates to ""Construction of five skyscrapers is ongoing at the site."" This clearly indicates the construction is still in progress.
"
Kedu ihe akaebe na-egosi ọdịdị ọgba nke ụmụnna nwanyị asaa ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Mgbanwe na okpomọkụ**

The passage explicitly states that infrared images show temperature variations between day and night, indicating they are likely caves because they are cooler during the day and warmer at night compared to their surroundings.
"
Kedu ka esi achọpụta njirimara okpomọkụ nke ụmụnna nwanyị asaa ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Foto infrared**.

The passage explicitly states that ""Ụmụ onyinyo infràreèd na-egosipụta na mgbanwe okpomọkụ ahụ sitere n'ụbọchị na abalị na-egosi na ha nwere ike ịbụ ọgba."" This means the thermal characteristics were determined using infrared imagery.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the man drove the vehicle with the explosives (""Nwoke ahụ kwọrọ n'ebubo ụgbọ ala...""). So option A is true.
*   The passage says he is *suspected* of detonating the bomb (""Ejidere onye echere na ọbụ ya gbasuru ogbunigwe ahụ...""). The passage does *not* specifically state he has been formally charged. So, option B is **not** necessarily true.
*   The passage says authorities know his ethnicity (""...ha ma na ọ bụ onye otu agbụrụ Uigọọ""). So option C is true.
*   The passage says he was injured in the explosion (""ka omerụchara ahụ n'ihi mgbari ogbunigwe ahụ""). So option D is true.

Therefore, the answer is **B**."
Ndị ọchịchị kwadoro kedu nkọwa gbasara mwakpo ahụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Nzụlite agbụrụ nke onye a na-enyo enyo**

The paragraph states ""Ndị isi amatabeghi aha ya, mana ha ma na ọ bụ onye otu agbụrụ Uigọọ,"" which confirms the ethnic background of the suspect. The passage does not provide information on the names of involved people, or the intent for the attack. Therefore, the other options are incorrect.
"
"Na egwuregwu na Ellis Park, kedụ otu ga-asọmpi?","The correct answer is **C: Australia na South Africa**.

The passage states: ""A ga-agba egwuregwu ikpeazụ nke ogbe a n'Elis Pak na Johanesbọg n'izu na-abịa abịa, mgbe ndị Sprịngbọks ga-agba Ọstrelia."" (The final game of the series will be played at Ellis Park in Johannesburg next week, when the Springboks will play Australia.)
"
Ebee ka a ga-eme egwuregwu na-esote n'etiti Springboks?,"The correct answer is **C: Johannesburg**.

The passage states: ""A ga-agba egwuregwu ikpeazụ nke ogbe a n'Elis Pak na Johanesbọg n'izu na-abịa abịa, mgbe ndị Sprịngbọks ga-agba Ọstrelia."" This clearly indicates that the next game for the Springboks will be in Johannesburg.
"
"N'ime ozi a, kedụ n'ime ihe ndị a ka ọdụ ụgbọ elu ahụ zutere nsogbu?","Based on the passage, the space station encountered the following problem:

*   **B: Na-echekwa gyroscope** (Losing a gyroscope early on)

The passage states: ""Ọdụ ụgbọ nọ n’eluụwa ahụ nọgidere na-akpa àgwà, n'agbanyeghị ofufu gyroscope na mbụ..."" (The space station continued to behave, despite the earlier loss of a gyroscope...)
"
"Kedu ihe bụ ọrụ nke ọdụ ụgbọ elu kwesịrị ịbụ, dịka akụkụ nke akwụkwọ ahụ siri dị?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: Na-aga n'ihu na-eme mgbanwe** (Continuing to misbehave).

The passage states the station ""nọgidere na-akpa àgwà"" (continued to misbehave) despite the loss of the gyroscope. This indicates that the station's expected function was *not* to misbehave, and the focus of the passage is on the station's problematic behavior.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Ahụrụ gyroscope furu efu.** (Lost gyroscope was found) - The text mentions the loss of a gyroscope, but not finding it.
*   **C: Imecha njem mbara igwe** (Finishing a spacewalk) - Finishing a spacewalk is mentioned, but it is not the main role of the space station.
*   **D: Na-agbanye ụgbọ elu** (Turning on the jets) - Turning on the jets is what happened after the Russians fixed the problem, but it is not the main role of the space station."
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-ekwu banyere ọnọdụ ahụ bụ nke na-abụghị eziokwu?,"The incorrect statement is **D: AOL nọ na-eche ebubo**.

Here's why:

* **P** clearly states that AOL *brought* the complaints, meaning they were the ones *filing* the charges, not *facing* them. The defendant was the one being tried.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D**.
"
Kedu nke kacha mara ọnọdụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **D: AOL webatara okwu a nke mbụ.**

The passage states that AOL was the company that brought the complaints. This is the same as saying they initiated the case.
"
"Kedu klọb Vidal ji malite ọrụ ya, dịka ekwuru na paragraf, oge atọ gara aga?","The correct answer is **A: Sevilla**.

The paragraph states that Vidal joined Barça from Sevilla.
"
"Maka Barça, egwuregwu ole Vidal pụtara?","The correct answer is **A: 49**

"
Gịnị kpatara na ị gaghị enye ịdọ aka ná ntị sitere na ụlọ ọrụ Jakarta Geophysics?,"The correct answer is **D: Ozuzughị oke ogo ala ọma jijiji**.

The passage states that a tsunami warning was not issued ""because the earthquake had not reached the requirement of magnitude 6.5."" This directly implies that the earthquake's magnitude being insufficient was the reason for not issuing a warning.
"
"Gịnị ka ala ọma jijiji ahụ kpatara, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: Ndị bi n'ụjọ** (The residents in fear).

The passage states that despite the lack of a tsunami warning, the residents became fearful and started fleeing their homes and markets. This indicates that the earthquake caused fear among the residents.
"
Kedu otu n'ime ihe ndị a na-eme ka anyanwụ na kpakpando ndị ọzọ na-arụ ọrụ?,"The correct answer is **D: Ntughari, nọmba Rossby, na luminance**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""A na-ejikọta ọnụ ọnwụnwụ ọkụ na ntụgharị ya amata akara Rossby nke otu kpakpando"" (Luminance and rotation are linked to the Rossby number of a star).
*   It also states: ""Ka akara Rossby na-adị obere karịa, ka arụmarụ na-adịkwu obere nke kpakpando n’ikwanye ugwu nye ụmụ ntụgharị nke ihendọta."" (The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in giving influence to their rotations).

Therefore, rotation, Rossby number, and luminance are the key factors identified in the passage as influencing the activity of the sun and other stars."
Kedu otu esi ekenye nọmba Rossby na kpakpando?,"The answer is **A: Ìhè na ntụgharị**.

The passage states: ""A na-ejikọta ọnụ ọnwụnwụ ọkụ na ntụgharị ya amata akara Rossby nke otu kpakpando..."" This directly says that light output and rotation are combined to determine a star's Rossby number.
"
Ndị zara ajụjụ ole na ntuli aka ahụ kwadoro Australia ịghọ otu mba ozugbo?,"The correct answer is B: Pasent 29.

The question asks about the percentage of respondents who believed Australia should become a republic *immediately*. The passage states, ""Ka ịtụ vootu nọ na ngwụcha, pasentị iri abụọ na itolu n'ime ndị elebaara anya kwenyere na Ọstrelia kwesịrị ịbụrụ mba nọọrọ onwe ya ngwa ngwa..."" which translates to ""As voting neared its end, twenty-nine percent of respondents believed that Australia should become a republic immediately...""
"
"Kedu mgbe Australia ga-ekwupụta na ya bụ mba, ka Julie Gillard siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **C: Emela**.

The passage states that Julia Gillard said she believes Australia *should* be a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign. It doesn't state *when* she believes it should happen, only that she believes it *should* happen. Therefore, based on the provided text, we cannot determine when Julia Gillard thought Australia should declare itself a republic. The passage only states that she believes it should happen *after* Queen Elizabeth II leaves office, but it doesn't specify a timeline.

"
Kedu nzukọ bụ isiokwu nyocha nke iwu?,"The correct answer is **C: Ụlọ ime ime (Planned Parenthood)**.

"
"Ònye, dị ka paragraf ahụ, rịọrọ mgbaghara maka akwụkwọ ndị ahụ furu efu?","The correct answer is **D: Ebe nzi ozi Obanazawa**.

The passage states: ""N'elekere 11:20, ndị uwe ojii gwara ndị ngagharị iwe ahụ ka ha laghachi azụ n'elu ụzọ ebe ndị ji ụkwụ na-aga, na-akọwa na ọ dịla mkpa ha ịtụle ikike ha nwere ime ngagharị iwe dịka ụzọ na-akpọchi."" This directly indicates that at 11:20, the police instructed the protestors to move back to avoid blocking the road.

Kedu n'ime okwu ndị a gbasara nyocha Dr. Ehud Ua bụ eziokwu?,"The correct answer is **B: N'ime ụmụ oke ndị nwere ọrịa shuga, ọnọdụ ahụ adịla mma** (In the mice with diabetes, the condition has improved).

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Ugbu a, anyị nwere ụmụ oke ọnwa anọ na-arịabu ọrịa shuga mana ha anaghị arịazi ya"" which translates to ""Now, we have four mice who were previously diabetic but are no longer."" This directly supports option B.

Let's examine why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndị ọrịa nwere akụkọ ihe mere eme nke ụdị ọrịa shuga 1 nwere ike ịhụ na nchoputa a nyere aka** (Patients with a history of Type 1 diabetes may find this finding helpful). The passage explicitly mentions Dr. Ur's view that the findings are *not* relevant to Type 1 diabetics.
*   **C: O doro anya na nchọpụta ahụ nwere ike ime ka a gwọọ ya** (It is clear that the findings may lead to a cure). Both Dr. Ur and the passage itself stress that the research is in early stages, and Dr. Ur is skeptical about a cure.
*   **D: Ọtụtụ ụmụ oke nwere ahụike mbụ ebutela ọrịa shuga** (Many previously healthy mice have developed diabetes). The passage focuses on mice *already* diabetic showing improvement, not previously healthy mice developing the condition."
"Gịnị ka Dr. Ua na-enwe obi abụọ banyere ya, dị ka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **B: Ọ bụrụ na a ga-enweta ọgwụgwọ**.

The passage states that Dr. Ur ""o kwenyeghị na a ga agwọtanwu ọrịa shuga"" (he doesn't believe diabetes can be cured). Therefore, he doubts the possibility of a cure.
"
Kedụ otu n’ime nkwupụta ahụ nke na akọwaghị nke ọma ihe mberede Ụgbọelu nke CG4684?,"The correct answer is **C: Ụgbọelu ahụ gbalịlị ike ya ịdà ugboro atọ tupu ọ kụjasịa.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states the plane attempted to land twice (""attempted to land at Kokoda yesterday as PNG Flight CG4684, but aborted once previously"").
*   The passage never mentions a third attempt. Therefore, option C is not accurately described in the passage.
The other options can all be confirmed from the passage."
Gịnị na-akpata ihe mberede Ụgbọelu CG4684 iji gbochie ọdịda ya?,"The correct answer is **D: Ọnọdụ ihuigwe ahụ adịghị mma**.

The passage states ""Otu ihu igwe ọjọọ nke kpatara ọdịda nlotu ahụ..."" meaning ""Bad weather caused the plane crash..."". Therefore, bad weather conditions were a contributing factor in the plane's crash.
"
"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, kedụ okwu banyere ahụmiihe Franciszek Kowal’s bụ eziokwu?","The correct answer is **B: O nweghị ihe mere ya** (He wasn't hurt).

The passage explicitly states: ""Isi awele m mere onweghi ihe mere m"" which translates to ""Nothing happened to me.""

Therefore, the answer is B.
"
Gịnị kpatara o ji esi ike ilele n’ụzọ ka mfe nke Ajọ Ikuku metụtara Danielle?,"The correct answer is **C: Aka nọ ebe dị anya ịdà** (The storm is currently very far away).

The passage states that it's difficult to predict Danielle's impact because ""dị ka oké mmiri ozuzo ahụ ka toro aka site n’imetụ n’ala, ọ ka na-ara ahụ inyocha etu o nwere ike isi metụta United States ma ọ bụ Caribbean."" This translates to: ""As the storm is still forming and far from land, it is difficult to predict how it might impact the United States or Caribbean."" Therefore, the distance is the key factor making prediction difficult.
"
Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara Tropical Storm Danielle na-adakọghị n'ihe akaebe ahụ nyere?,"The correct answer is **D: Ọ dị nso n’ọdịda ala** (It is close to land).

Here's why:

*   **A: Amaghị mmetụta ya na Caribbean** (Its impact on the Caribbean is unknown): The passage states, ""ọ ka na-ara ahụ inyocha etu o nwere ike isi metụta United States ma ọ bụ Caribbean"" which implies the effect on the Caribbean is unknown.
*   **B: E yibere ya n’Oke shmiri Atlantik** (It formed in the Atlantic Ocean): The passage explicitly says it formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
*   **C: O nwere ike nwògharịa bụrụ ajọọ ifufe** (It may develop into a hurricane): The passage mentions, ""Ndị ọka mmụta sayensị...ekwuola na oke ikuku Daniel ga aghọ ajọ ikuku na ụbọchị Wenezde,"" which means scientists predict it could become a hurricane.
*   **D: Ọ dị nso n’ọdịda ala** (It is close to land): The passage states it's 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida. This indicates that it is far from land.

Therefore, the only statement that is *not* supported by the text is that it is close to land."

"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, o tere anya i si na Fujian bụ ajọọ oke ifufe?","The correct answer is **C: 70 kilomita**.

The passage states that ""n'abalị Ọgọọst 9, anya oke ikuku Mọrakọt fọrọ kilomita iri asaa ka o ruo mpaghara Chaịna a na-akpọ Fujian"" which translates to ""On the night of August 9, Typhoon Morakot was about 70 kilometers away from the Chinese region called Fujian.""
"
Onye kelere George W. Bush mgbe ọ wụdatara n’Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng na Lee Hsien Loong**

The passage states: ""Onye na-esote onye isi iche mba Sịngapọ bụ Wong Kan Seng nabatara ya ma ya na onye isi oche mba Sịngapọ bụ Lee Hsien Loong kparịtara ụka..."" which translates to ""The Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore, Wong Kan Seng, welcomed him, and he discussed trade and terrorism with the Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Hsien Loong..."" Therefore, both Wong Kan Seng and Lee Hsien Loong greeted him.
"
Kedụ mgbe onyeisi ala na-ekwu banyere mmụba azụmaahịa Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: N’isonye ọdịda ntụziaka ọkaraoge ya**.

The passage states that ""Mgbe otu izu gasịrị ebe ọ dara ada na ntuliaka ọkara oge, Bush gwara ndị na-ege ya ntị maka mmụba nke azụmahịa n'Eshia."" This directly links his talk about increased trade in Asia to the aftermath of the midterm election losses.
"
"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, kedụ otu n’ime bụ ebumnobi gọvermenti?","The correct answer is **C: Nwetara ọtụtụ ụgbọala 1,300 ndịọzọ**.

The passage states that the government committed in March to invest more in acquiring freight wagons. The *additional* 300 wagons bring the *total* to 1,300 to be acquired. The goal is to reduce congestion.  Therefore, acquiring 1,300 wagons is the government's objective as stated in the passage.
"
Kedụ ihe gọvernmenti na-ekwu?,"The correct answer is **C: Ha na-atụ alọ ikwado ụgbọala 1,300 ọzọ**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the government initially promised to invest in procuring freight wagons.
*   The recent announcement adds 300 wagons to the initial promise.
*   The passage continues by stating that this brings the total number of wagons to be procured to 1,300.

Therefore, the government plans to support an additional 1,300 wagons in total."
"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, kedụ ozi ama ama?","The correct answer is **A: Ogo iheegwu ebèlatala**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""mweda nke ogugo iyi egwu ruo ogugo siri ike"" which translates to ""a decrease in the terror threat level to the serious level.""
*   Option A accurately reflects this.
*   The other options are incorrect based on the passage:
    *   B is incorrect, the passage states that the decreased threat level ""apụtaghị na ihe iyi egwu nile agaala"" or ""does not mean all threats are gone"".
    *   C is incorrect, the passage explicitly states ""Enweghị ihe ọmụma na-atụ aka na a ga-enwe mwakpo mgbe na-adịghị anya"" or ""There is no information pointing to an imminent attack.""
    *   D is incorrect, the passage does not mention any information about a forthcoming attack."

Onye tụpụtara alò arụkwaghị m CEP ikpeazụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Mmadụ ike**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""N'ọnwa gara aga ozi sitere n'onye ọchịchị kwadoro ọgbụgba arụkwaghịm CEP nọbu anọ dịka ihe so n'usoro omume ihe ibuje obodo na ntuli aka ọhụrụ"". This translates to: ""Last month, an order from the government approved the resignation of the previous four CEP as part of the procedure for carrying out civil and new elections."" Therefore, the order/proposal for the resignation came from the government. Since Martelly is the President, 'Mmadụ ike' referring to the government is the closest answer."
"Dịka nkwupụta ahụ siri dị, nke ndị Egwuregwu USA na akwadoghị site n’agwa mkparị ndị ọsọ Nassar?","Based on the provided text, the answer is **C: Ọdịnamkpa na-enwe mgbanwe n’ime òtù**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: *""Anyi kwere na ihe USOC dere na odimma ndi egwuregwu anyi na klob ha nakwa egwuregwu ga enweta uru n’ihu karia ma o buru na enwe mgbanwe n’ulo oru anyi kama inapu ndi mmadu asambodo ha.""* This directly indicates that USA Gymnastics supports changes within the organization.
* It further states: *“Mpaghara jimnasktik nke obodo USA kwadoro nlebara anya nke onwe nke nwere ike igosi ka mmegbu nke ndị lanarịrị ihe mberede Larị Nassar kọwapụtara nwere ike ịbụ ihe metere aka a na-amaghị maka ya na anabatakwa mgbanwe ndị kwesịrị ekwesị.”* Which shows their support for necessary changes.

While the other options may be related to addressing the Nassar scandal, the passage specifically highlights the organization's support for internal changes."
"Dịka nkwupụta ahụ kwuru, kedụ ihe bụ isi ebumnuche ndị Egwuregwu mgbati ahụ USA na kọmịshọnụ Olympik nke United States ịga n’ihu?","The correct answer is **D: Na-akwalite ogige di mma maka egwuregwu ndịọzọ**

The passage explicitly states: ""Egwuregwu Jimnastik nke mba USA na ndi USOC nwere otu ebumnobi - ime egwuregwu jimnastik, na ndi ozo, enweghi iyi-egwu dika ike kwere nye ogwu egwu isoro nro ha n’uzo n’enweghi iyi-egwu, ziri-ezi na gburu-gburu akwadoro akwadoro.""
"
Ebee ka ụgbọmmiri na-aga mgbe ihe ahụ mere? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palawan**.

The passage states, ""Avenger class mine na emesho ugbommiri, ugbommiri ahu n’aga Puerto Princessa na Palawan."" This directly translates to ""The Avenger class mine countermeasures ship was going to Puerto Princessa in Palawan.""
"
Kedụ nke n’ime ndị a bụ eziokwu banyere ụgbọ mmiri akpọrọaha na paseeji ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ọ bụ n’ụzọ gara na Puerto Princesa**.

The passage states ""...Avenger class mine na emesho ugbommiri, ugbommiri ahu n’aga Puerto Princessa na Palawan."" which means ""Avenger class mine countermeasures ship, the ship was going to Puerto Princessa in Palawan."" This confirms that the ship was heading to Puerto Princesa.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ọ bụ site na Palawan:** The passage says it was going *to* Puerto Princesa *in* Palawan, not that it originated from Palawan.
*   **C: Ọ bụ atụnsụgharị ụgbọmmiri m:** The passage identifies it as an ""Avenger class mine countermeasures ship,"" which translates to ""Avenger class mine na emesho ugbommiri"", which means ""Avenger class mine countermeasures ship"".
*   **D: Ọ bụ nke enyere n’ụgbọmmiri nke Asaa nke Ọchịagha mmiri U.S:** The passage states that it is assigned to the Seventh Fleet, not the other way around. It states ""E kenyere ya ụgbọagha nke asaa nke ndị agha mmiri Amerịka nọ na Sasebo, Nagasaki dị na Japan"" which translates to ""It is assigned to the seventh fleet of the US Navy in Sasebo, Nagasaki in Japan"""
Onye nyefere nkwupụta ahụ banyere ndị agha US?,"The correct answer is **D: Ode akwụkwọ ntaakụkọ** (Ode akwụkwọ ndị nta akụkọ).

The passage states that the message was given ""site n'aka onye ode akwụkwọ ndị nta akụkọ"" (by the press secretary). While the message contained a statement from Donald Trump, the press secretary was the one who delivered the message.
"
"Dịka nkwupụte kwuru, kedụ obodo echere nwere ikikere ichekwa ndị agha ejidere?","The correct answer is **D: Turkey**.

The passage explicitly states that ""Mba Turkey ga-anarakwa ichebe ndị agha ISIS enwudere ndị.""
"
Kedu ihe e chere kpatara nkukota a?,"The correct answer is **A: Gburugburu ugwu**.

The passage states: ""Mkpọkasị ahụ mere n'elu ugwu, e kwenyekwara na ọ bụ ya kpatara ajọ ọkụ."" This directly indicates the mountainous terrain is believed to be the cause of the crash.
"
Kedu ụdị ala nkuko ahụ mere?,"The correct answer is **D: keugwu**.

The passage states: ""Mkpọkasị ahụ mere n'elu ugwu..."" which translates to ""The crash occurred on a mountain...""
"
Kedu ihe ndị isi na-atụ anya ka iju mmiri ahụ mezuo?,"The correct answer is **A: Aja aja na-arụzi**.

The passage states: ""ndị isi na-enwe olile anya na ọ ga-ezu iji weghachi ụmụ ugwu aja nke mmiri riri na ndịda ụzọ mmiri"" which directly translates to ""officials are hoping it will be enough to restore the sandbar islands that were flooded south of the waterway."" This means they are hoping the flooding will repair/restore the sandbars.
"
Kedu otu n'ime ihe ndị a ka mmepụta mmiri ahụ gbanwere kpamkpam?,"The correct answer is **D: Mgbasa nke ájá (The spread of sediment)**.

The passage states that the dam stopped the flow of sediment that spread sediment throughout the river. This sediment was important for forming sandbars and coastal habitats. Therefore, the dam directly impacted the spread of sediment. While the other options are related, the *direct* and initial impact was on the sediment flow.
"
"Onye nyere United States ozi gbasara mwakpo enwere ike, dịka akụkụ akwụkwọ akụkọ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **C: Ebe amatabeghị**

The passage states that the U.S. received the information from an ""onye ozi a na amaghị"" which translates to an ""unknown informant"". Therefore, the source is unknown.
"
Kedu n'ime ndị a kacha chịkọta atụmatụ mbuso agha nke ndị na-eme ihe ike?,"The best answer is **C: Ihe mgbawa ga-apụ na akara ala abụọ dị iche iche.**

Here's why:

*   The original text says the attacks will target ""akara ngosi ala pụtara ihe"" (significant landmarks) in both Ethiopia and Kenya. This directly corresponds to option C.

The other options are not as accurate:

*   A: Only mentions bombing the capital of one country.
*   B: Only mentions that bombs will occur in two countries.
*   D: Only mentions that bombs will occur in one country."
Kedu onye n'ime ndị edepụtara na-abụghị onye ọka iwu?,"The correct answer is **D: Makis Triantafylopoulos**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Makis Triantafylopoulos is a journalist.
*   The other individuals (Petros Mantouvalos, Sakis Kechagioglou, and George Nikolakopoulos, and Evangelos Kalousis) are identified as either judges or lawyers."
Kedụ ndị mmadụ ndị ana-akpọghị aha ma ha so na ihe arụ a hụrụ n’ime iwu obodo Greek?,"The correct answer is **D: Ndị atoni**.

The passage mentions that the scandal involved ""ndị ọka ikpe na ndị oka iwu na ndị solositọ na ndị atoni mere n'afọ ndị gara aga"". Of the options given, only ""ndị atoni"" are explicitly named as being involved alongside judges, lawyers, and solicitors."
Ụzọ ole furu site n’aka ndị India?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

The passage states: ""But, after they lost their wickets India only made 36 runs losing 7 wickets to end the innings.""
"
"Gịnị bụ akara kacha elu nke innings, dabere na ngafe ahụ?","The correct answer is **A: 70 na-agba ọsọ**.

The passage explicitly states ""Robin Uthappa nwetara akara kachasị na innings, ọsọ 70..."". Therefore, 70 is the highest score.
"
Kedu nke n'ime ihe ndị a na-adịghị etinye aka na iwe Adam Cuerden?,"The correct answer is **A: Ntuziaka ọhụrụ maka ọdịnaya mmekọahụ na webụsaịtị.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states Adam Cuerden was upset about:
    *   The removal of Wales' artwork (B)
    *   Wales not listening to them (C)
    *   Deception about the reasons for the artwork's removal (D) - phrased as ""lying about it being a legal issue""

*   The passage only mentions guidelines on sexual content as the **cause** of **public** outrage, *not* as something that directly upset Adam Cuerden himself. Adam Cuerden's specific grievances were the removal of the artwork and the behavior of Wales surrounding that event."
"Kedu ihe ewepụrụ na webụsaịtị ahụ, dabere na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: Ihe ngosi mmekọahụ** (Sexual content).

The passage states that the public outrage stemmed from attempts to legislate ""ihe ngosi mmekọahụ"" (sexual content) on the website.
"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-akwadoghị, n'echiche Amir Khan?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is:

**A: Olimpik kwesịrị inwe ndị inyom na-alụ ọgụ**

The text states that Amir Khan believes ""in his heart that women shouldn't fight."" This directly implies he doesn't support women's boxing being included in the Olympics.
"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a Amir Khan ga-akwado dabere na akụkụ ahụ, n'agbanyeghị mmasị ya?","The correct answer is **C: Egwuregwu Olympic 2012**.

The passage states that despite his personal views against women's boxing, Amir Khan said he would support British athletes in the 2012 London Olympics. This means he would support the event itself and the athletes participating in it, regardless of his personal opinions.
"
Kedu afọ Peter Lenz nwụrụ?,"The correct answer is **C: n'ime ụlọ ọgwụ** (in the hospital).

The passage states that Peter Lenz was taken to a local hospital where he later died.
"
kọwaa Xavier Zayat?,"The correct answer is **B: Ọsọ agbakwụnye**.

The passage states that Xavier Zayat was a ""fellow racer"" who hit Peter Lenz after Lenz fell off his motorcycle. ""Ọsọ agbakwụnye"" translates to ""fellow racer"" in Igbo.
"
Ọnọdụ ndị dị aṅaa ga-eme ka ọ dị mkpa ka onye njem ụjọ ghọta otú ụgbọ elu si arụ ọrụ?,"The best answer is **B: Ọ bụrụ na mmadụ enweghị mmasị n'ife ofufe sitere na nchegbu na-amaghị ama.**

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states that understanding how an airplane works can help overcome fear *based on the unknown or feeling out of control*. Option B directly addresses this point.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Ọ buru na onye-ije nēwe iwe n'ihi egwu-ha (If the passenger is angry because of their fear)** While anger *could* be a result of fear, the passage doesn't directly link anger to the usefulness of understanding airplane mechanics.
*   **C: Mgbe ụdị ụgbọ njem anaghị amasị onye njem (When the passenger does not like that type of transport)** Simple dislike of flying is not the reason mentioned in the passage that understanding airplane operation would be helpful.
*   **D: ọ bụrụ na egwu ha na-efe efe bụ ihe na-awụ akpata oyi n'ahụ (If their fear of flying is terrifying)** While extreme fear *might* benefit from this knowledge, the passage focuses on fear stemming from the unknown aspects of flying. Option B is a more direct and encompassing answer."
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a kwesịrị ka onye ọbịa na-emefu ego ga-adịgide?,"The correct answer is **C: Tulee ọnụ ahịa na ụlọ ọrụ njem dị iche iche**.

The passage argues that comparing prices across different travel agencies (nchịkọ) is beneficial for saving money. Options A and D are also good practices, but option C aligns closest with the message in P. Option B, making bookings directly, directly contradicts the advice in P.
"
"Kedu ihe ndị ọbịa kwesịrị ibu ụzọ mee, dabere na paragraf, iji nweta azụmahịa ụgbọ elu kacha mma?","The correct answer is **B: Ekwesịrị iji tụnyere ọnụ ahịa nchịkọta ihe dị iche iche.**

The passage explicitly states that it benefits the traveler to compare prices from different aggregators before booking tickets.  The passage argues against booking directly or immediately without price comparison.
"
Kedu mgbe onye agbakwunyere dị mkpa maka nnyefe?,"The correct answer is **C: Ọ bụrụ na ezipụ ihe ọ bụla dị ka akpa enyochara.**

The passage states: ""Naanị ụzọ a ga-esi ewefe ya ọsịịsọ wụbụ iziga ya dị ka ibu e nyochagoro. Iwu ụlọọrụ ụgbọelu agaghị ekwe ha izipụ ibu na-enweghị otu onye njem..."" This directly links the need for an escort (the ""agbakwunyere"") to items sent as checked baggage (ibu e nyochagoro).
"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a, dabere na paragraf, ka ị kwesịrị itinye uche kachasị mgbe ị na-ahọrọ ụgbọ elu na-efe efe na-emekarị maka njikọ aka?","The correct answer is **D: Enwere ike inye uru ndị ka mma bụ ụgbọ elu**

Here's why:

The paragraph emphasizes that while it might seem intuitive to join the frequent flyer program of the airline you fly most often, you should be aware that benefits and destinations can vary significantly within an alliance. This implies you should focus on the airline within the alliance that offers the best potential benefits for *you*, not simply the one you use most frequently.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: onye na-ebu ya nwere isi ihe:** This is partially relevant as having more points is generally a good thing. However, the paragraph's main point is not about accumulating points, but about maximizing *value* and destination options.
*   **B: ụgbọ elu nke njikọ aka kacha ukwuu:** The size of the alliance isn't the primary focus. A larger alliance doesn't automatically mean better benefits for you specifically.
*   **C: ụgbọ elu nke ị na-ejikarị efe efe:** The paragraph is warning *against* simply choosing the airline you fly most often without considering the benefits offered by other airlines within the same alliance."
"Kedu onye nwere ike inye ọtụtụ kilomita efegharị ugboro ugboro, dabere n'ofe ahụ?","The answer that best aligns with the information in passage P is **D: Onye na-ebu ọzọ n'ime otu njikọ ahụ**.

Here's why:

*   Passage P explicitly warns against assuming that all airlines within the *same* alliance/partnership will offer the same rewards or destinations.
*   Option D suggests that another carrier *within* the same alliance might offer better frequent flyer mileage accumulation.

Therefore, the passage implies that different airlines within the same alliance/partnership can offer different frequent flyer benefits."
"Kedu n'ime mmetụta ndị a nwere ike imerụ ahụ site n'ịṅụbiga mmanya ókè, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **B: ọhụụ**.

The passage states that drinking illegally produced alcohol can contain methanol, which ""nwere ike ịkpata ikpu ìsì ma ọ bụ ọnwụ n'ime nha ndị dị obere"" (can cause blindness or death in small quantities). Ikpu ìsì translates to blindness, which directly affects the vision.
"
"Gịnị nwere ike ibelata mmetụta ọjọọ nke mmanya na-aba n'anya, bụ́ nke a kpọtụrụ aha n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **C: Nkezi mmanya na-aba n'anya** (Moderation in alcohol consumption).

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes the importance of knowing your limits and avoiding excessive drinking. This directly implies that moderation is key to reducing the negative health effects.
*   The other options are incorrect because:

    *   **A: Na-agwakọta mmanya na methanol** (Mixing alcohol with methanol): The passage explicitly warns against illegal alcohol due to the presence of methanol, which is extremely dangerous.
    *   **B: Na-aṅụ mmanya e mere n'ụzọ iwu na-akwadoghị** (Drinking illegally made alcohol): The passage states the opposite, that illegal alcohol poses greater health risks.
    *   **D: Na-aṅụ mmanya na ndị dị iche iche** (Drinking alcohol with different people): The passage doesn't talk about the advantages or disadvantages of drinking with different people."
Kedu mpaghara Amsterdam nwere ụfọdụ ụkpụrụ ihe onwunwe kachasị elu?,"The passage states: ""...ụlọ kacha dị ọnụ ebe ahụ karịa ebe ndị ọzọ n'obodo."" and ""Mpaghara Kanal... gbara Binenstad nọ n'Amstadam gburugburu.""

Therefore, the answer is **A: Mpaghara nke Canal**.
"
Kedu ka mpaghara Canal si bụrụ na UNESCO mara ya dị ka saịtị ihe nketa ụwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Mkpa akụkọ ihe mere eme na omenala ya**.

The passage explicitly states that the Canal District was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site ""for its cultural and historical significance to the world."" While the other options may be true, they are not the *reason* given for the UNESCO designation.
"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a, dị ka paragraf ahụ, kwadoro njem na Phnom Krom?","The correct answer is **B: Na-agafe Angkor Pass**.

The paragraph explicitly states: ""Ngafe Angkọ bụ ebe a ga agaferịrị ịbanye ebe ofufe n'ihi nke a echefukwala iweta akwụkwọ akwụkwọ ngafe gị ma ị na-aga Tonle Sap."" This directly supports needing an Angkor Pass to visit the temple.
"
"Kedu ihe dị mkpa maka ndị njem ịbanye Phnom Krom, dịka akụkụ nke akwụkwọ ahụ si dị?","The correct answer is **C: Nweta Angkor Pass**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ngafe Angkọ bụ ebe a ga agaferịrị ịbanye ebe ofufe n'ihi nke a echefukwala iweta akwụkwọ akwụkwọ ngafe gị ma ị na-aga Tonle Sap."" This translates to: ""The Angkor Pass is a must to enter the sanctuary so don't forget to bring your pass when you go to Tonle Sap.""

"Kedu otu n'ime ihe ndị a nwere ike igbochi onye njem nleta ịga Antarctica, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **D: Enweghị ike ịgagharị gburugburu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that visiting Antarctica ""chọrọ ahụike anụ ahụ"". Not being physically fit enough to travel around would therefore be a restriction on visiting Antarctica.
The other options are incorrect because:
*   **A: Na-emefu nnukwu ego na njem**: While the passage says trips are expensive, the question asks about physical restrictions.
*   **B: Otu ọchịchọ inyocha Oké Osimiri Ross**: The passage says tourist visits are limited to the Peninsula, Islands and the Ross Sea, and so this is an incentive to visit and not a restriction.
*   **C: Nhazi ọrụ nke na-enye ohere njem na Disemba na Jenụwarị**: The passage says visits can only take place in the summer (Nov-Feb), so having this availability would be ideal and not a restriction."
Kedu mpaghara Antarctica nke onye njem nlegharị anya nwere ike ịga leta?,"The correct answer is **D: Ala ya**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Nleta nke ndị njem nleta...ejedebere ha n'ụzọ dị ukwuu na Peninsula ahụ, Agwaetiti na Oke Osimiri Ross."" These locations constitute the coastal areas or lands of Antarctica.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   A: Mmiri nnu: While the Ross Sea is mentioned, the focus of tourist travel is on the peninsula and islands, not simply the ""salt water.""
*   B: Mpaghara ime obodo: The passage states that the interior is mostly visited by specialized air tours for specific events, not general tourism.
*   C: Okpu: The passage does not mention that tourists can visit the okpu."
Ebee ka opekata mpe na a ga-achọta ebe nleba anya nke oge a?,"The passage states that modern research telescopes are large facilities in remote locations with good weather. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: N'ebe dị anya (In a remote location)**
"
Ebee ka teliskop nyocha nke oge a nwere ike ịnọ?,"The correct answer is **D: N'ime nnukwu ụlọ** (In a remote facility).

The passage states that modern research telescopes are often located in large facilities in remote areas with good weather. Therefore, option D is the most accurate based on the information provided.
"
"Kedu ebe ga-adị mma maka ụbọchị osimiri dị jụụ, dabere na ebe ahụ?","The passage mentions that Tamaki Drive beaches, located in the Waitemata Harbour near Mission Bay and St Heliers, are ""sometimes crowded family beaches with many shops along the waterfront"" and that ""swimming is good.""  While the passage mentions other locations, it doesn't suggest them as good choices for a *quiet* beach day. St Heliers is presented as an area, and has similar features to the other beaches mentioned.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: St Heliers**.
"
"Ebee ka ọnọdụ igwu mmiri nwere ike bụrụ nke kacha dịrị nchebe, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The passage states that the beaches in the North Shore (North Harbour area) are mostly sandy and have ""sheltered swimming."" The other options are not specifically mentioned as having safe swimming conditions. Therefore, the best answer is:

**B: Mpaghara North Harbor**
"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a ka a ga-eche na ọ dịghị mma mgbe ị na-aga n'ebe ahụ a kpọtụrụ aha n'amaokwu ahụ?,"The correct answer is **B, C, and D**.

The passage explicitly states the following should not be done at the site:

*   Using the Holocaust or Nazis as a topic of ridicule.
*   Defacing the site by drawing symbols or graffiti on structures.

Therefore, the following options are not appropriate:

*   **B: Na-etinye akara n'ebe dị nso na saịtị ahụ (Putting markings near the site):** This is essentially the same as drawing symbols or graffiti.
*   **C: na-agwa njakịrị (telling jokes):** Telling jokes trivializes the suffering that occurred there.
*   **D: Ịkpụcha ụlọ (Carving on buildings):** This constitutes damage and defacement of the site.
*   **A: ịdị oké njọ (Being serious):** The paragraph doesn't discourage the expression of seriousness. It in fact expects and asks you to be serious.

Therefore, the correct options are B, C, and D."
Kedu nke kacha mma na-achịkọta asụsụ?,"Based on the passage, the best answer is **C: Ewuru**.

The passage states that auxiliary languages are ""akamere ma ọ bụ asụsụ ndị ewuru ewu"" (either invented or constructed languages). ""Ewuru"" (constructed) is the closest and most encompassing term describing this characteristic.
"
Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a bụ ụgha gbasara asụsụ inyeaka?,"The statement that is FALSE regarding auxiliary languages is:

**A: Ha bụ asụsụ okike nke a na-eji kwalite nzikọrịta ozi n'etiti ndị nwere ike ọ gaghị enwe ike ịme ya** (They are natural languages that are used to promote communication between people who may not otherwise be able to).

**Explanation:**

The passage states that auxiliary languages are either *constructed* or *artificial* languages, *not* natural languages. The purpose described in option A is correct, but the nature of the languages (natural vs. constructed/artificial) is the incorrect part.
"
"What should a passenger verify if their voyage is in the winter, per the passage?","The correct answer is **A: Ebe nke ụlọ**.

The passage specifically advises passengers crossing the Northern Baltic in winter to check the location of their cabin. The other options are mentioned in the passage but not as something passengers should specifically verify related to winter travel.

Kedu ihe kpatara akara na ọkwa na Catalan ji jupụta na Barcelona?,"The correct answer is **B: Ọ bụ asụsụ mbụ e nwere n’obodo ahụ**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Catalan is prioritized because it is legally recognized as the language ""nke bu nke obodo"" which translates to ""the language of the country"" or ""the official language"". This directly supports the idea that it's considered the primary or original language of the region, hence the prevalence of Catalan signage.

The other options are not supported or are misleading:

*   **A: E jiri ya tụnyere Spanish, a na-aghọtakarị ya** - While the passage mentions most people understand Catalan, it doesn't explicitly say it's understood *more* than Spanish. Everyone understands Spanish according to the text.
*   **C: Na Barcelona, a na-asụkarị ya** - The passage mentions that about half the population wants to speak Catalan. This does not mean that most people speak it more than Spanish, as the passage indicates all the residents are fluent in Spanish.
*   **D: Ọtụtụ ndị na-eji Metro na ebe ọha ndị ọzọ na-asụ Catalan** - While some people use Catalan in public places, the passage doesn't establish this as the *reason* for its dominance in signage. The legal standing is the main reason."
A na-eme mkpọsa ugboro ugboro nke sistemu Metro Barcelona n'ime asụsụ ndị a?,"The passage states that announcements in the Barcelona Metro are initially made only in Catalan. However, unscheduled announcements are made through an automated system in various languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.

The question asks which language announcements are *regularly* made in on the Barcelona Metro. Because scheduled announcements are made only in Catalan, the answer is B.

Therefore, the answer is **B: Catalan**
"
Kedu n'ime ihe eji enyere ndụ aka na-agaghị abụ ihe kacha mkpa maka akwa akwa na nri ụtụtụ?,"Based on the passage, the focus is on the artistic enhancement of the bed and breakfast experience, highlighting luxurious bedding (handmade or antique), locally sourced or unique breakfasts, and historically significant buildings with antique furnishings and well-maintained grounds.

While Wi-Fi is a convenient amenity, it's not directly related to the core focus of the passage, which is the elevated artistic and experiential aspects of bed and breakfasts. Options A, B, and C all directly contribute to the unique artistic and experiential aspects described in the passage.

Therefore, the answer is:

**D: Wi-Fi ọsọ ọsọ**

"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị akụkụ dị mkpa nke asọmpi n'etiti B&Bs dị elu, dịka akụkụ akwụkwọ akụkọ ahụ siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: Nhazi nke oge a (Modern decoration)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically mentions that high-end B&Bs often feature ""otu ụlọ kara nka keakụkọala nwere ụmụ ntinye ihe ime ụlọ nke mgbe ochie"" (an old historical home with antique interior decor). This suggests that a historical or antique setting is valued, not a modern one.

The other options are explicitly mentioned as important:

*   **B: Nhọrọ nri ụtụtụ nke oge dị iche iche (Selection of seasonal breakfast items)**: The passage states that breakfast includes ""nri ụtọ n'oge nke mpaghara ahụ"" (seasonal delicacies from the region).
*   **C: akwa akwa (Bedding)**: The passage emphasizes the importance of the best bedding and states that ""ihe eji achọ ihe ndina kachasi nma"" (high quality bedding) is required.
*   **D: nri na ihe ọṅụṅụ ndị a na-emepụta n'obodo (Locally sourced food and drinks)**: The passage refers to ""nri ụtọ n'oge nke mpaghara ahụ"" (seasonal delicacies from the region).

"Kedu n'ime mmemme ndị a ka Beijing ga-anabata na 2022, dị ka ekwuru n'akụkụ a?","The correct answer is **B, C, and D.**

*   **C: Egwuregwu oyi:** The text explicitly stated, ""Obodo Beijing di na China ga bu obodo ga afu maka Egwuregwu Oge Oyi Olympic na 2022"".
*   **D: Mmechi mmechi:** The text explicitly states ""Beijing ga-eme mmemme mmeghe na mmechi ya"".
*   **A: Egwuregwu Olympic n'oge okpomọkụ:** The text explicitly states that Beijing hosted the Summer Olympics at some point, but the question asks about what will be hosted in 2022.

Therefore, the answer is **B, C, and D.**"
Kedu onye nwere ike ibute influenza avian?,"The correct answer is **C: ndị ọrụ ọkụkọ** (poultry farm workers).

The passage states: ""Ndị ka n'ọnụ ọgụgụ etinyela ndị ọrụ ọzụzụ ọkụkọ n'ọrụ, mana obere ihe ize ndụ dịịrị ndị na eledo nnụnụ anya."" This translates to ""The majority of cases have involved poultry farm workers, but there is little risk to bird watchers.""  Therefore, poultry farm workers are at higher risk.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ụzọ mmiri Waịt Sii-Baltik jikọrọ Oke osimiri Aktik na Oke osimiri Baltik..."" (The White Sea-Baltic waterway connects the Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea...). The Arctic Ocean is also known as the Polar Ocean.

(In night trains where people sleep, the train attendant may take your passport so you are not bothered while sleeping.) This directly answers the question of which type of vehicle might have your passport collected for that reason.

"Kedu mgbe enwere ike ịlele ID gị na ụgbọ oloko ndị na-agafe agafe, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **D: N'oge ụgbọ oloko na-akpụ akpụ** (During the train's movement).

The passage states, ""N’ufodu ugbo oloko n’agafe mba di iche iche ana enyocha ha mgbe ha na gbaa..."" which translates to ""In some trains that cross different countries, they are checked while they are moving...""
"
"Mgbe ị na-aga na oke okpomọkụ nke Singapore, olee nsogbu ndị a nwere ike ime?","The correct answer is **C: ike ọgwụgwụ n'ihi okpomọkụ**.

The passage mentions dealing with both heat and intense sun in Singapore. This directly relates to the possibility of heat exhaustion.  The other options don't logically connect to the heat being described.
"
Kedu onye ga-achọ ịnọpụ na pastries German?,"The answer is **A: onye nwere ihe nfụkasị ahụ siri ike**. Here's why:

* **The passage describes many common ingredients:** Fruits (apples, cherries, plums), nuts (almonds, hazelnuts), and coffee. Someone with severe allergies to any of these ingredients would want to avoid German pastries.

Let's look at the other options:

* **B: onye na-amasị decadent emeso:** The passage describes pastries that are flavorful and made with various fruits and nuts, suggesting a decadent experience.
* **C: onye na-anabata chocolate:** While the passage does not specifically mention chocolate, German pastries may contain chocolate. There is no reason for this type of person to avoid pastries.
* **D: onye nātọ utọ nātọ utọ kari utọ:** German pastries are mentioned as going well with strong coffee. This means pastries are sweet, thus making it a good treat for someone with this preference.
"
Kedu akụkụ nke pastries German na-ewere dị ka ihe na-eme n'oge?,"The correct answer is **C: Plum**.

The passage states that cakes are ""made with cherries and plums during the summer"". This indicates that plums are considered a seasonal ingredient in German pastries. While apples are mentioned as being used year-round, hazelnuts and almonds are mentioned as common ingredients in general, not specifically tied to a season.
"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-agaghị abụ aro maka njem dị ọnụ ala, dị ka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **C: Rịọ ego n'aka ndị ọzọ**.

The passage explicitly states that the advice provided is for travelers who do not ""beg or exploit others for personal gain.""  Therefore, asking for money from others is against the spirit of the passage and not a recommendation for budget travel according to the text.
"
"Kedu onye nwere ike ịgbalị ime njem na mmefu ego siri ike, dịka akụkụ akwụkwọ ahụ siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: onye na-ahụ ihe ịma aka.**

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically mentions traveling on a tight budget ""just as a challenge."" This directly aligns with someone who enjoys a challenge.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: onye na-adịghị mmachi oge:** While flexibility with time is helpful for budget travel, it's not the primary motivator described in the passage.
*   **C: Onye bu n'obi na-arụ ọrụ remotely ka ọ nọ n'ụzọ:** The passage focuses on reducing expenses and does not mention working.
*   **D: Onye na-ahụ n'anya ịhazi usoro ihe omume ha:** The passage emphasizes sacrificing comfort, time, and predictability."

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""nrubeisi siri ike na ha kara dị mkpa karịa otu ọzọ"" on the Point Marion to Fairmont section of the Buffalo-Pittsburg Highway. This directly contradicts the idea that speed limits are rarely followed.
*   The passage affirms that ""Ogologo okporo ụzọ ime obodo ndị zoro ezo dị"", ""Ụzọ dị warara"" and that ""ọrụ ekwentị mkpààgagharị ka dị ike ebe a karịa ọtụtụ ogologo ụzọ ndị ọzọ"".

Therefore, option C is the statement that is NOT true based on the passage."
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a kwesịrị ịbụ ihe kacha mkpa maka ndị ọkwọ ụgbọ ala n'okporo ụzọ Buffalo-Pittsburgh, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","Based on the passage, the most important thing for drivers on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh road is:

**C: Na-eme ngwa ngwa, ntụgharị dị nkọ**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the road is ""steep, narrow, and full of sharp corners"". This emphasizes the need to navigate these **curves** carefully.
*   The passage advises motorists to ""beware"" if inexperienced with rural roads, suggesting a challenging driving experience.
*   The passage also highlights the need for a ""rigid adherence"" to the speed limits.

The other options are less relevant:

*   **A: Na-eme ka okporo ụzọ kwụsịlata** - While the passage mentions the speed limits are small, the sharp and steep turns suggest this to be the greater hazard.
*   **B: Mkpuchi ekwentị ezughi oke** - The passage said that coverage is stronger than other longer stretches of road.
*   **D: Owuwu okporo ụzọ ugboro ugboro** - The passage doesn't mention anything about road construction."

Here's why:

The passage states that canyoning requires less training or physical fitness to start compared to activities like rock climbing, scuba diving, or downhill skiing. The other options are implied or directly mentioned as things that would be useful to have:

*   **A: Inwe ike igwu mmiri (Ability to swim):** The passage mentions swimming as one of the elements involved in canyoning.
*   **C: Ike ima elu (Ability to climb):** The passage mentions climbing as one of the elements involved in canyoning.
*   **D: Obere ntụziaka (Some instruction):** The passage mentions less training but does not mention not requiring some instruction.
"
"Maka njem nlegharị anya nke ọma, kedu n'ime ihe ndị a ka a ga-achọ?","The passage states that canyoneering requires swimming as one of its components. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Ịnya ụgbọ ala gị nwere ike ọ maala gị ahụ Ị makwaara ebe ike ya ruru"" meaning, ""Driving your car can be comforting because you know the limit of it.""

While the other options relate to camping from cars, they aren't directly presented as benefits *specifically* for someone preparing to camp in their car. The passage focuses on knowing your car's capabilities."
"Kedu ihe ndị na-ama ụlọikwuu ga-achọ izere ma ọ bụrụ na ha chọrọ ka a ghara ịhụ ha, dabere na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **C: Idobe ụlọikwuu n'ebe ọha na eze ma ọ bụ n'ihe nkeonwe.**

The passage states that setting up camp in public or on private land in any size settlement can attract unwanted attention. Therefore, to avoid being noticed, campers should avoid setting up camp in those locations.
"
"Ònye wuru Casablanca nke ugboro abụọ, dị ka ekwuru n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **D: Onye na-achị Morocco, sultan**.

The passage states that after the earthquake in 1755, ""Sọltan Ndị Moroko ahụ rụgharịrị obodo ahụ dị ka Darụ-I-Badya..."". This clearly indicates the Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city.
"
"Mgbe ọdachi dakwasịrị, ònye hapụrụ Casablanca ka ọ dị taa?","The correct answer is **C: Ọ bụ Spanish**.

The passage states that the city was given the name ""Casablanca"" by Spanish traders who built trading posts there. This implies they were significantly involved in shaping the city into what it is today, following the reconstruction after the earthquake.

"
Kedu ihe Armenia anaghị anabata?,"The correct answer is **A: Mpaghara Nagorno-Karabakh**.

The passage states that no country, ""not even Armenia,"" recognizes Nagorno-Karabakh. This directly answers the question of what Armenia doesn't recognize.
"
Kedu ihe ka na-emetụta mmekọrịta Azerbaijan na Armenia?,"The correct answer is **C: Arụmụka mkparita uka**.

The passage states: ""Arụmụka ọchịchị obodo ka na emebi mmekọ Amenia na Azabaịjan.""  This directly translates to ""A political argument is still harming relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan."" Therefore, a political dispute is still affecting the relationship, making C the most accurate answer.
"
Kedu ihe nwere ike ịkpata ego ọzọ mgbe ị na-enweta taksi na Charlotte?,"The correct answer is **B: inwe mmadụ atọ mụ na ya nọ**

The passage states: ""Enwere ụgwọ mgbakwunye dịịrị ibukarị ndị nje abụọ, ya mere nhọrọ nke a nwere ike ịdị ọnụ karịa ka okwesiri."" which translates to ""There's an additional fee for having more than two passengers, so this option may be more expensive than it should be.""
"
"Kedu ihe a ga-ele anya dị ka ihe ndọghachi azụ nke ịzụ ụmụaka na Charlotte, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **B: Iji ụgbọ ala.**

The passage mentions that families in Charlotte often use taxis instead of other forms of transportation. It also points out that taking taxis with multiple passengers can be expensive. This implies that the reliance on taxis, or car transportation in general, and its associated costs can be seen as a potential drawback of raising a family in Charlotte.
"
Onye chịrị mpaghara ugwu Chile tupu ndị Spen abịarute?,"The correct answer is **D: Incas**

The passage explicitly states: ""Tupu Ndị Spen abịarute na narị afọ iri na isii, ebe ugwu Chile nọ n'okpuru ọchịchị Inca...""
"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-emeghị na 1810, dị ka ekwuru n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: Chileke chịriri ndị Spen**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Chile declared independence in 1810.
*   The passage also mentions that Spain did not have a central government in some years and wars happened during Napoleon reign.
*   The passage mentioned definitive victory against the Spanish did not happen until 1818.

Therefore, the only thing that did **not** happen in 1810, according to the passage, is that Chile defeated the Spanish.
"
Kedu ka obodo ndị dị anya na Liguria si enweta ndị njem?,"The correct answer is **C: Ugbọ okporo ígwè ma ọbụ ụgbọ mmiri**.

Kedu nkwupụta gbasara myirịta Hawaii na Cook Islands bụ eziokwu?,"The correct answer is **C: Ha nọ na mpaghara oge yiri nke ahụ**.

The passage states: ""Ha no n’otu oge ka Hawaii, ya mere na oge ufodu ana eche maka agwaetiti ndi a ka ha bu “Hawaii gbadara n’okpuru”."" This directly indicates that the Cook Islands and Hawaii are in the same time zone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ha abụọ nwere ọnụ ọgụgụ ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ**: The passage says Cook Islands is reminiscent of *older* Hawaii before it had many hotels.
*   **B: O nweghị ọchịchị dịịrị otu n'ime ha**: The passage says Cook Islands is self-governing in free association with New Zealand.
*   **D: Enweghị obodo maka nke ọ bụla n'ime ha**: The passage states that the Cook Islands do not have cities.

"
Kedu otu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a na-abụghị eziokwu gbasara Cook Islands?,"The correct answer is **B: Ọ bụ otu agwaetiti.**

The passage states that the Cook Islands are made up of fifteen islands, not a single island.

Kedu n'ime ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri ndị a na-enye ụdị ebe obibi abụọ dị iche iche?,"The correct answer is **A: Siren**.

The passage states that Sirena is a ranger station offering both lodging and food. The other options (La Leona, San Pedrillo, and Los Patos) only offer lodging.

"Ebee ka ị ga-edobe akwụkwọ ikike ogige, dị ka paragraf si dị, ma ọ bụrụ na ịchọghị iji kredit kwụọ ụgwọ?","The correct answer is **B: Jimenez, Puerto**.

The text states: ""A ga-enwetali ikike idọsa moto n'aka Renja Steshọn na Puerto Jimenez, mana ị gaghị ejili kredit kad akwụ ha ụgwọ."" This indicates that you obtain a parking permit in Puerto Jimenez, and you can't pay with a credit card. The question asks where you get a *park permit* if you don't want to pay with credit, and the passage mentions parking permits in Puerto Jimenez.
"
"Kedu ụdị ski a na-eme na mbara ala dị steepụ, dịka ọ dị na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **A: Ski na ije ije**.

The passage mentions that ski touring is related to mountaineering, which is practiced on steeper terrain and requires more robust equipment.

"Kedu ihe nwere ike inyere ndị na-agba ọsọ azụ azụ aka na-achọ ime ngwa ngwa karịa, dabere na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **C: Ezi ọnọdụ**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that backcountry skiing is like hiking but with skis. In ideal conditions, you can cover more distance than hiking. This implies that good conditions are beneficial.
*   A mentions that you can ski further than hiking,
*   B mentions that back country skiers should not have a heavy backpack
*   D is not mentioned in the passage and is invalid

Kedu ihe na-esiri ndị njem na-enwe ujo nbanye ọzọ?,"The correct answer is **D: Na-alaghachi n'ọdịbendị ha si malite**.

The passage discusses reverse culture shock, which is the difficulty people face when returning to their home culture after living abroad. The text explains that travelers may have adapted to the new culture and lost some aspects of their original culture, making it challenging to readjust upon return. Options A, B, and C relate to traveling to a new country. Option D is specific to the question being asked, ""What makes reverse culture shock difficult for travelers?"".
"
"Kedu ụdị njem nlegharị anya nwere ike nweta ujo nbanye ọzọ n'ike karịa, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **B: Ndị na-eme njem ma biri ná mba ọzọ wee mee mgbanwe ngwa ngwa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that reverse culture shock can affect people who easily adapt to new cultures. They may have lost some of their original cultural traits, making it difficult to readjust to their home culture.
*   Options A, C, and D don't align with the passage's explanation of reverse culture shock."

Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara moose na-akwadoghị?,"The correct answer is **A: Ha bụ ndị e kere eke na-emegide ibe ha.** (They are inherently aggressive creatures).

The passage states that moose don't inherently seek to attack, but will defend themselves if they perceive a threat. This contradicts the idea that they are inherently aggressive.

Therefore, the impossible situation is:

A: Mmiri dị ala (Low water)
The correct answer is A

Kedu afọ mbụ a kpọtụrụ skiing dị ka egwuregwu na akụkụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **C: N'afọ 1861**.

The passage states, ""ma n’ime 1861 òtù egwuregwu skii ntụrụndụ nke mbụ bụ nke emepere..."". This clearly indicates that 1861 is when the first recreational ski club was formed, thus being recognized as a sport.

"
Kedu akụkụ nke obere agwaetiti dị n'Ebe Ọwụwa Anyanwụ Africa na-enweghị? ,"The correct answer is **C: Aha ọma anụ ọhịa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that Madagascar is unique in terms of its wildlife (""kọntinentị nọọrọ onwe ya ma a bịa n'ihe gbasara anụmanụ ndị bi n'ọhịa""). This implies that the smaller islands likely don't have the same level of unique or notable wildlife.
*   The passage explicitly states that many smaller islands are either independent nations (D: Mmekọrịta-nnwere onwe na obodo ndị ọzọ) or have connections with France (A: Mmekọrịta na France).
*   The passage says the islands are ""rezọt ọnụ osimiri bu ebe mkporindụ"" which shows that they have many resorts."

Here's why:

*   **A: Aspọtụ dị irè maka ọnwa 6 ka ụbọchị njem gachara** - Akụkụ ikpeazụ nke paragraf ahụ na-ekwu ""Akwụkwọ ngafe gị ga adịrịrị ire opekarịa mpe afọ isii karịa oge njem gị."" nke pụtara n'ụzọ ihe gbasara mgbe asportụ ahụ ga-akwụsị irè.

Kedu ebumnuche nke iwu njem Ecuador na-abụghị maka ya?,"The best answer is **B: Na-echekwa usoro mbufe njem n'usoro nke ọma**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ihe ndị a achọrọ ka e mewere inye usoro nkwagharị ala ahaziri ahazi n'etiti mba abụọ ndị ahụ."" This directly translates to establishing a structured and organized immigration process.
*   **The passage emphasizes:** The requirements for visas, validations, and passport validity are all aimed at controlling and organizing the movement of people between the two countries, streamlining the immigration process, which supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Na-amachi ọnụ ọgụgụ ndị njem dị ka o kwere mee:** While these measures *could* have the effect of limiting travel, the passage doesn't state that as the primary goal. The emphasis is on regulating the *process*, not simply reducing numbers.
*   **C: Na-enyocha oge ọnụnọ onye ọbịa:** While passport validation is important, it isn't the main point of the information provided.

*   **D: Na-akwado eziokwu paspọtụ:** Verifying passport validity is a component of the process, but the overall intention is broader than that.

Therefore, option B is the most comprehensive and directly supported answer by the information provided in the passage."
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a nwere ike ịdị ọnụ na mba ọzọ karịa n'ụlọ?,"The answer is **B: Okpokolo agba kacha elu**.

Here's why:

The other options are not necessarily more expensive abroad:
* **A**: P states that Ule anya (eye exams) nwere ike ịdị ọnụala karịa na mba ofesi (may be cheaper in foreign countries)
* **C & D**: These are not discussed in the passage."
Kedu ihe egwu nwere ike ịdị mgbe ị na-azụta okpokolo agba dị oke ọnụ na mba ofesi?,"Based on the passage, the best answer is **C: Ikekwe adịgboroja (Possibly counterfeit)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ụfọdụ nwere ike ịbụ adịgboroja (some may be counterfeit)."" While the passage mentions other potential issues, the risk of buying counterfeit frames is the most directly stated danger.

Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a ziri ezi n'ihe gbasara ojiji ego nke agwaetiti Falkland?,"The correct answer is **C: Mgbe ọpụpụ site n'àgwàetiti ndị ahụ, Falkland pound kwesịrị ịgbanwe.**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Ọ na-ara ezigbote ahụ ịgbanwe ego Falklands ma e si n'agwaetiti a pụọ, ya mere gbanwee ego gi tupu i si na ya pụọ."" which means it's very difficult to exchange Falkland pounds outside the islands, so you should exchange them before leaving.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Agwaetiti ndị dị anya na-ewere naanị kaadị kredit na paụnd Britain:** The passage says that on outer islands, credit cards ""may not be accepted,"" indicating they are not the *only* accepted form of payment and only some credit cards are accepted. It also says that you ""may"" be able to use British pounds, not that it is the only currency accepted.
*   **B: Naanị ebe ga-anata dollar na ego US bụ Stanley:** The passage only mentions US dollars being accepted ""around Stanley"", not *only* in Stanley.
*   **D: N'ozuzu, paụnd Britain bụ ego a kacha amata, nke Falkland na-esote ya:** The passage says ""A ga-anabata n'izugbe pam ndị Britenụ ebe ọbụla n'ime agwaetiti ndị ahụ"", implying that it is the most widely accepted currency. The passage does not however mention that the Falkland pound is the second most commonly recognized."
"Dị ka paragraf ahụ si kwuo, olee ebe usoro ịkwụ ụgwọ na-abụghị kaadị kredit ga-akacha enye aka mgbe ị na-aga Falklands si United States?","The correct answer is **A: N'ime ụlọ ahịa FIC West**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that the only bank on the islands (where you can exchange currency) is near the FIC West store in Stanley. This implies that the FIC West store area is a central location for financial transactions, making alternative payment methods useful if you need to exchange or withdraw cash near the bank.
*   Options B, C, and D are not as helpful. If you are trying to pay in Stanley, the FIC West store is the only reference point for where you can get access to FKP, GBP or USD."
Kedu ihe omume megidere mmemme a na-eme n'ụlọ nsọ?,"The correct answer is **A: Amu nwa elephant**.

The passage states that temple festivals often commemorate the temple's anniversary, the birth of its deity, or another significant event in the temple's history. Giving birth to an elephant is not related to a church anniversary.
"
Ebee ka mmadụ nwere ike ịhụ enyí nwere ihe ịchọ mma?,"The correct answer is **C: Na njem n'oge ememe temple.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that temple festivals in Kerala are ""tasty to see,"" and specifically mentions ""processions of elephants decorated with equipment."" This directly links decorated elephants to temple festivals and processions.

"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a kachasị mma iji chekwaa ego na azụmahịa ma ọ bụ ụgbọ elu nke mbụ, dịka akụkụ akwụkwọ ahụ siri dị?","Based on the passage, the best answer is **A: Na-agbakwụnye ya na mmefu ụlọ ọrụ gị.**

The passage explicitly states that the most straightforward way to fly in business or first class is to have your company pay for it. The other options are not supported by the text:

*   The passage implies that first-class tickets are more expensive than business.
*   The text does not suggest options to get better deals.
*   The text does not suggest there can be discounts."
"Kedu ihe ga-abụ ihe na-emebi oge ịchọ mgbe ị na-edobe klaasị ọnụ ahịa, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si dị?","The correct answer is **A: Ugbọ elu n'ahịrị kwụ ọtọ**.

This means that it is a waste of time to look for discounts on direct flights in business or first class. Direct flights are flights ""n'ahịrị kwụ ọtọ"", so the correct answer is A.
"
"Mgbe a na-atụnyere ọnụahịa ọnụahịa zuru oke na Africa na ụgwọ mba ụwa, gịnị na-adịghị mkpa ka etinye ya na ya?","The question asks what is NOT important to include when comparing the total cost of traveling in Africa versus traveling internationally.

The passage mentions that when considering international travel costs, you should include visa fees, departure taxes, ground transportation, etc.  This implies that visa fees, departure taxes, and ground transportation are important factors in the international travel cost.

Option A: Is a cost outside of Africa, which the passage implies you should consider.
Option B: The passage says you should consider departure taxes. This implies considering them both within and outside Africa.
Option C: This is about the cost of visa in Africa. The passage is asking for what to add up for non-Africa travel.
Option D: Is a cost outside of Africa, which the passage implies you should consider.

The passage *directly* states to consider visa fees *outside* Africa. It also implies you should consider departure taxes and ground transportation outside Africa. The passage does not specifically say anything about whether visas in Africa are expensive.

Therefore, the least relevant factor to consider when comparing the *total* cost of traveling in Africa vs. internationally is the expensiveness of African visas, as the passage focuses on additional expenses *outside* of Africa.

So, the correct answer is C: Visa maka Africa dị oke ọnụ (Visas for Africa are expensive)
"
Kedu ihe a na-akọ na ụlọ ahịa ahịa na-amalite inye ụdịdị dị iche iche?,"The correct answer is **A: Nri esigoro esi** (Ready-made food).

The passage states that supermarkets are increasingly offering a variety of ready-made foods.
"
Kedu ihe ụfọdụ ụlọ ahịa na-enye nwere ike ịrata onye ahịa ịzụrụ nri a kwadebere?,"The correct answer is **C: Nri ọhụrụ (Fresh food)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage emphasizes that supermarkets are expanding their prepared food sections.** Freshness is a key selling point for prepared food, as it suggests quality and health. Supermarkets often highlight the freshness of their ingredients to attract customers.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Ulọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ dị nso (Restaurants nearby):** The passage focuses on what supermarkets offer to compete with restaurants, not the presence of restaurants themselves.
*   **B: Udị nhọrọ ole na ole (Few choices):** A limited number of choices would likely deter customers, not entice them.
*   **D: Oven na ngwa ndakwa nri (Oven and microwave):** The passage mentions that lack of cooking facilities might be a reason people turn to buying ready made meals."
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a nwere ike bụrụ nsogbu maka ndị Switzerland na ndị Belgium na-asụ French?,"The passage states that the number systems in Belgian and Swiss French have some distinct differences from French spoken in France, and that the pronunciation of certain words is slightly different. It also mentions that Belgians and Swiss French speakers will be able to understand you even if you use the standard French number system.

Therefore, the potential problems for Swiss and Belgian French speakers would be:

*   **A: Ihe ngosi French a na-ahụkarị maka ọnụọgụgụ** - While they can understand it, it is a difference.
*   **C: Akpọpụta okwu French kpọmkwem** - It is slightly different.

**D** can be removed. The passage explains that it is normal and that the citizens are well aware.

**B** is too broad. It does not give a specific point.

Therefore, A and C are the strongest contenders. However, between the two, differences in the number system are more complex and potentially more confusing. Pronunciation differences are usually easier to pick up on.
Answer: A"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-adịghị akwado France, Belgium, ma ọ bụ Switzerland?","The correct answer is **D: Ka esi asụpe ụfọdụ mkpụrụokwu French**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Otu esi ekwu okwu ọ bụla:** The passage states that the pronunciations of certain words are slightly different in Belgium and Switzerland compared to France.
*   **B: Usoro nke nọmba:** The passage explicitly mentions that the number systems are different in Belgium and Switzerland compared to France.
*   **C: Udị French nke ụlọ akwụkwọ na-akụzikarị:** The passage notes that all French speakers in Belgium and Switzerland learn standard French in school.
*   **D: Ka esi asụpe ụfọdụ mkpụrụokwu French:** The passage does not mention that the spelling of words is different between France, Belgium, and Switzerland."
Kedu mgbe o yighị ka ị ga-enweta ego ọnwụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Mgbe ọ bụla ị na-eme njem Lufthansa site na Paris gaa US**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Lufthansa offers bereavement fares for flights originating in the **U.S. or Canada**.
*   Option C describes a Lufthansa flight originating in **Paris**, which is neither the U.S. nor Canada. Therefore, it's unlikely you'd get a bereavement fare in that scenario.
*   The passage says Delta, Air Canada, and Westjet provide them.
*   The passage states you must use a phone to make the booking."
Kedu ihe bụ eziokwu nke ọnụọgụ ọnwụ?,"The correct answer is **C: A ghaghị ịdeba ha akwụkwọ ozugbo site na ekwentị** (They must be booked directly via phone).

The passage states: ""N'ọnọdụ niile, i ga-ejiriri ekwentị gị akwụ ụgwọ ọnọdụ gị n'ụlọ ọrụ ụgbọelu a."" This directly translates to ""In all cases, you must use your phone to pay for your position with this airline."" In other words, you need to book by phone.

Kedu mgbe ọ ka mma iji ngwaọrụ GPS kwụ ọtọ karịa ngwa igodo GPS?,"The correct answer is **C: mgbe ị hapụrụ oke anabatara gị**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that phone GPS apps can be limited or useless without a data connection. Leaving your coverage area would likely mean you no longer have a data connection, so a standalone GPS device would be better in that situation.
*   Option A is incorrect because the passage states that using a GPS app saves money.
*   Option B is incorrect because the passage states that GPS apps only work if you have a data connection.
*   Option D is incorrect because the passage states that GPS apps save money over borrowing or purchasing dedicated GPS devices."
Kedu ihe kpatara ịghara iji ngwaọrụ igodo GPS dị iche kama iji ngwa mkpanaka?,"The best answer is **A: nnwere onwe pụọ na nchegbu maka njikọ data.**

The passage states that the main drawback of using a phone's GPS is its reliance on a data connection, which can be unreliable or unavailable in certain situations. Therefore, the freedom from worrying about data connectivity is a key advantage of using a dedicated GPS device.

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: emefu obere:** While potentially true, the passage focuses more on the *type* of cost (data) rather than overall cost.
*   **C: Enweghị ike ịgbazite ụlọ:** This is not mentioned in the passage as a potential problem when using GPS in mobile phone
*   **D: enweghị ịzụrụ maapụ ọhụrụ:** The passage actually states that using GPS in mobile phones helps you save money on buying new maps.

The passage emphasizes choosing a travel agent who is knowledgeable about the Galapagos and the various boats available. This ensures you're matched with a boat that suits your interests and priorities. Option C directly reflects this advice.
"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị usoro nke casinos na-eji mee ka ndị ahịa na-egwu egwu, dị ka ekwuru na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **A: Ìhè sitere na anyanwụ n'ụba**.

Here's why:

*   **B: Ụgwọ ọrụ dị ka tiketi egwu egwu ego** - The passage states, ""They often have special food, liquor and complimentary entertainment, to keep visitors in a pleasant mood, and keep them on the premises."" Complimentary entertainment can include things like show tickets or gambling coupons.
*   **C: A na-enye ihe ọṅụṅụ na-akwụghị ụgwọ** - The passage states, ""Some gambling establishments offer complimentary alcoholic drinks.""
*   **D: clocks adịghị adị** - The passage states, ""Windows and clocks are never to be found within them.""

*   **A: Ìhè sitere na anyanwụ n'ụba** - The passage states ""Windows and clocks are never to be found within them"". This directly states that casinos restrict natural light from entering, which is the opposite of having an abundance of sunlight.

"Kedu ihe onye na-agba chaa chaa maara ihe kwesịrị ịnọpụ, dị ka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ si kwuo?","The passage states: ""Mana, mmanya ogbugbu na-egbochi echiche, ma ndị nille na-agba chaa chaa nke ọma mara mkpa nke ọ dị ịnọ n'ezi echiche."" This translates to: ""But, intoxicating liquor hinders clear thinking, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying clear-headed.""

Therefore, the answer is A: ịṅụbiga mmanya ókè (drinking too much alcohol).
"
"Kedu akụkụ okwu ka etinyere n'isi n'etiti nkebiokwu, dịka akụkụ nke akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **B: Aha aha**

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that nouns (aha aha) are capitalized even in the middle of sentences to differentiate them from verbs (ngwaa) and make reading easier.
"
Kedu ihe akụkụ ahụ ga-atụ aro ka isi okwu nke aha nwere ike gbakọọ?,"The correct answer is **B: Ịmata ngwaa dị iche iche**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that capitalizing words (specifically including ""Sie"") helps to differentiate between certain verbs and nouns. This means knowing the difference between verbs and nouns is crucial for understanding the text.
*   The passage also mentions that knowing whether a word is a verb or noun helps understanding of the sentence."
"""Kedu ihe mmegharị ahụ na-egosi """"gafere"""" n'ime ime obodo Malaysia?""","The passage states that among the Malay people in Malaysia, beckoning with a finger means ""come."" Therefore, the answer is:

*   **A: na-eji mkpịsị aka aka iji tụgharịa**"
"""Kedu ngagharị nke enwere ike ịkọwa site na paragraf ka """"laghachite""""?""","The correct answer is **C: Mgbe ị na-efegharị, tụgharịa ọbụ aka gị ka ọ pụta ìhè**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a British traveler in Spain might misinterpret a wave with the palm facing the waver (instead of the person being waved to) as meaning ""come back."" This implies that the palm facing the waver is the key aspect of the ""come back"" gesture. Therefore, turning the palm of your hand to face the waver during the wave describes this gesture best.
"
"Kedu ihe na-eme crvasses, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si dị?","The correct answer is **A: Akwa mmiri ejiri snow mee**.

Here's why:

*   The passage directly mentions that the movement of the glacier leads to ""cracks in the snow cover.""
*   The passage also states that the walls and roofs of ice caves can collapse and seal cracks, which implies the initial presence of cracks, like crevasses, due to the snow cover being disturbed.
The other options are either too broad or focus on specific consequences of glacier movement rather than the initial formation of crevasses."
"Kedu otu n'ime ihe ndị a nwere ike izobe àkwà mmiri snow, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si dị?","The correct answer is **C: Mgbidi** (Mgbidi means ""Walls"").

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Mgbidi na mkpuchi elu nke ọgba akpụrụ mmiri nwere ike ịda ma mechie mgbawa."" (Walls and the roof of the ice cave can collapse and close gaps). This directly indicates walls can collapse and hide snow bridges.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   Mgbawa(Gaps) - are not the things that are collapsing to cause hiding of the snow bridges.
*   ọgba aghara oyi (Cold chaos) - This isn't related to the action of hiding snow bridges.
*   nnukwu iberibe (Large chunks) - do not contribute to hiding snow bridges."
"Kedu ebe chọrọ usoro nchekwa ndị ọzọ n'ihu ndị ọbịa, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **B: mpaghara Goma gbara ya gburugburu**.

The passage states: ""Dịka Goma nwetụrụ nchekwa n’ụdị dịtụ mma, nleta ọ bụla na mpụga Goma bụ nke ekwesịrị inyocha iji ghọta ọnọdụ nke ọgụ ka nogidesiri ike n’Ugwu ngalaba ọchịchị kizu.""

This clearly indicates that visits *outside* of Goma require careful consideration of security due to ongoing conflict.
"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a ga-abụ ndụmọdụ ọjọọ maka onye ọbịa na Goma?,"The best answer is A: Agha North Kivu na-atọ ụtọ

Here's why:

*   **A:** The passage specifically states that any visit outside Goma requires careful consideration due to ongoing conflict in North Kivu. Saying the conflict is ""enjoyable"" is insensitive and directly contradicts the warning.
*   **B:** The passage mentions tracking the mountain gorilla, implies it is expensive
*   **C:** The passage explicitly states that using boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) is a way to get around Goma.
*   **D:** The passage mentions the city is the base to ascend Mount Nyiragongo
"
Kedu ụbọchị n'August ka a ga-enweta ikike ịla azụ azụ?,"The correct answer is **B: 1 nke Eprel**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ya bụ na ikike azụụlọ maka ụbọchị mbido ọbụla na Mee ga-adị na Jenụwarị 1."" This means that backcountry permits for any trip starting in May become available on January 1st.

The text also states: ""Ikikere nwedebere ike ichekwa ndida ahu, ma diri-adi na ubochi mbu nke onwa, onwa ano tupu mbido onwa ahu."" This tells us that the permit becomes available 4 months before the trip's start date.

To find out when August permits become available, we subtract 4 months from August:

August - 4 months = April

Therefore, August permits become available on April 1st.
"
Kedu iwu etinyere iji gbochie mmebi nke ọwa mmiri ahụ?,"The passage describes several rules aimed at protecting the Grand Canyon:

*   **Requiring backcountry permits:** ""Njem ọnụnọ ọbula a na-eme n'okpuru ọnụ Gụrandị Kenyọnụ kwesịrị ka onye njem nwee nkwado imeobodo."" (Any overnight stay below the rim of the Grand Canyon requires a backcountry permit). This is to control the number of people.
*   **Advance application:** ""Ikikere nwedebere ike ichekwa ndida ahu, ma diri-adi na ubochi mbu nke onwa, onwa ano tupu mbido onwa ahu."" (Permits are designed to protect the area and are available on the first of the month, four months prior to the start date). This helps manage the number of permits.
*   **Limits on permits:** ""Enwere oke nye akwụkwọ ikike nkwado maka njem nkwugharị nke a na enye ndị bu ụzọ bịa."" (There are limits to the number of permits for walk-up trips). This also controls numbers and impact.

Option D, ""ọnụ ọgụgụ dị nta nke akwụkwọ ikike"" (a limited number of permits), directly addresses the concept of restricting the number of people allowed in the area to prevent damage.
Therefore, the best answer is **D**."
Kedu n'ime ụlọ ndị a dabara na nkọwa nke ụdị ụlọ nkwari akụ a kacha nta?,"The correct answer is **C: Ndị ọbịa ama ama ma ọ bụ ndị ama ama** (Famous or notable guests).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...ụfọdụ oge ha na-anabata ndị isi obodo na ndị a maara aha ha bụ ndị ọbịa."" ( ""...sometimes they would host local leaders and well-known figures as guests."")

The other options, while they might be found in some historical hotels, are not directly mentioned as defining characteristics in the provided text. Therefore, ""C"" is the most accurate answer based solely on the information provided.
"
"Kedu n'ime ihe eji enyere ndụ aka ndị na-azụ ahịa ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ ga-akacha amasị ya, n'ihi eziokwu dị na akụkụ ahụ?","Given the description in paragraph P, the answer that best aligns with the ""high-end traveler"" who appreciates the hotel's history and elegance would be:

*   **A: Enwere iberibe ihe ochie gburugburu ụlọ**

Here's why:

*   **A** directly reflects the hotel's historical significance and antique furnishings, which are highlighted in the description. This is something a wealthy traveler who values the hotel's heritage would appreciate.
*   **B** while famous restaurants are a plus, they don't necessarily connect to the historical and luxurious aspects emphasized in the paragraph.
*   **C** night entertainment is not necessarily relevant, but it does not allign to the context of an antique hotel.
*   **D** explicitly states the hotel is cheap, which is the opposite of the high-end feel described in the paragraph.

Therefore, option A is the most aligned with the target audience described in the paragraph."
"Kedu ihe a ga-ezere, dịka ederede, ndị ọbịa na Greenland?","The correct answer is **D: ""na-akpọ onye bi na Greenland """"Eskimo""""""**.

The passage specifically states that while the term ""Eskimo"" is still accepted in America, many Arctic people, especially in Canada, find it offensive. The passage advises visitors to avoid using the term.
"
"Kedu otu n'ime ihe ndị a nwere ike ịkpata nsogbu maka ndị ọbịa na-adịghị njikere na Greenland, dịka akụkụ akwụkwọ ahụ siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **C: Ihu igwe**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Oyi bụ sọ ihe ize ndụ ndị na-adịghị njikere ga agabiga"" (Cold is the only danger unprepared visitors will encounter).
*   The passage also mentions the long daylight hours in summer being a potential sleep problem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: anwụnta ndị Nordic:** The passage mentions that they can be annoying, but not a significant problem.
*   **B: Mpụ:** The passage says crime is not common and there are no ""ghettoes.""
*   **D: Ndị obodo:** The passage emphasizes that Greenlanders are not generally hostile to foreigners."
Central plaza nke taa dị n'ime obodo ndị a?,"The correct answer is **A: Ubi nke Union (Jardín de la Unión)**.

The text explicitly states that Jardín de la Unión is now a public plaza. The question asks which of the mentioned locations is a central plaza in present times. Therefore, Jardín de la Unión is the answer.
"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị eziokwu, dịka ekwuru na paragraf, gbasara Jardn de la Unión?","The correct answer is **A: egwu egwu na Central gazebo**.

Here's why:

*   The paragraph mentions restaurants around the garden (C), it was an old convent atrium (D), and it mentions Callejon del Basso as the place where a love story happened (B).
*   There is no mention of a central gazebo or music performances in the description of Jardín de la Unión. So A is the false statement."
Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara mkpagharị ụbọchị ka a ga-ewere na ọ bụ eziokwu n'iburu n'uche akụkụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Ọtụtụ mmadụ nwere ike ịnụ ụtọ mmega ahụ a ma ọ bụrụ na ha nwere ogo ahụike dị mma** (Many people can enjoy this exercise if they have a good degree of fitness).

Here's why:

*   **P** states ""...for day hikes on easy trails little preparation is required, and anyone with a decent level of fitness will enjoy them."" This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maka njem ụbọchị na ụzọ dị mfe, atụmatụ dị ntakịrị dị mkpa** (For a day trip on an easy trail, little planning is needed) is true based on the text, however C is a better answer because it includes the part about fitness.

*   **B: Ọ bụ ezie na ebe dị anya na-adịgasị iche, e mere ha ka e were mee njem n’otu ụbọchị** (Although distances vary, they are designed to be traveled in one day) This is true, but again, not as good as C.

*   **D: Ezinụlọ ndị nwere ụmụntakịrị kwesịrị izere ịga njem n'ụbọchị** (Families with small children should avoid day trips) - **P** states the opposite: ""Families with small children may require more preparation, but a day on an easy trail is practical even with infants and toddlers."" This makes option D false."
"Kedu mgbe njem ụbọchị na-ewe obere nkwadebe, dị ka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **B: Mgbe onye njem na-adị mma n'anụ ahụ** (When the hiker is physically fit).

The passage states: ""Maka ịrị ugwu n'ụbọchị site n'okporo dị mfe obere nkwadobe ka ọ ga-ewe, ma onye ọbụla ahụ gbasituru ike ga-ekpori ndụ na ha."" This translates to ""For day hikes on easy trails, little preparation is needed, and anyone who is physically fit will enjoy them.""
"
"N'adịghị ka ndị Norway ndị ọzọ, gịnị na-akọwa ala dị larịị na Rogaland ma ọ bụ Agder?","The correct answer is **D: Ugboro ugboro, heather na-ekpuchi ha**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that in Rogaland and Agda, the flat, treeless areas are often called ""hei,"" which means ""flat, treeless land."" While the passage doesn't explicitly mention heather, the focus is on the local terminology and description of the land in Rogaland and Agda. If we assume that heather is a common plant in flat, treeless landscapes, then option D is the correct response.
*   The passage describes the other parts of Norway and does not imply that fjords are not present. Therefore, option B is incorrect.
*   Option C implies that they are the same as the other parts of Norway, however, the local term, ""hei"", is the way to describe them.
*   Option A is incorrect as it specifically states ""treeless land"" in the passage."
"Kedu ihe na-agaghị abụ njirimara Norway, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si kwuo?","Based on the provided text, the answer is **B: Platea nwere osisi**.

Here's why:

* The text describes ""vidde"" or ""hei"" in Norway as wide, open, expansive, and *without trees*.  A plateau with trees contradicts this description.
* The text mentions upland slopes becoming high, flat land which is the *Plateau*, it does not say Platea with trees, rather the opposite.
* Option D, *Moorland* and Option C, *Fjords* are both possible features of Norway.

Therefore, plateaus with trees is NOT a characteristic based on the passage.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that ""peak mountain tourism is usually during the Indian summer.""

The other options are incorrect because:

*   Option A: only when there is a lot of snow.
*   Option B: throughout the snowboarding season
*   Option D: only during the winter season"
Kedu ihe ụfọdụ ị ga-anọrịrị ma ọ bụrụ na ịchọrọ ịchọta ụgbọ mmiri na-arịọ maka enyemaka?,"The correct answer is **A: iji ụkwụ na-aga n'ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri**.

The passage explicitly states actions like ""na-ejegharị ije na dọọkụ"" (walking on the dock) which translates to ""using your feet to walk around the dock."" The passage clearly highlights this as a method to find boats looking for help. The other options are not directly mentioned in the text as a necessary action.
"
"Mgbe ị na-achọ ụgbọ mmiri nke chọrọ enyemaka na marinas, gịnị ka ị ga-eme?","Based on the passage (P), the correct answer is **A: Chọpụta ma kpọtụrụ ndị ọkwọ ụgbọ mmiri** (Find and contact boat owners).

The passage describes actively seeking out boat owners and offering help, which aligns with option A. The following are the steps that the passage recommends:

*   Putting up notices of your availability
*   Walking around the docks
*   Approaching people cleaning their boats
*   Trying to contact boat owners in their slips
"
Kedu mpaghara nwere ike ịdọta onye ọbịa nke chọsiri ike maka ọchịchị ndị agwaetiti ahụ n'oge gara aga?,"The correct answer is **A: Northern Oke osimiri**.

The passage states: ""Ebe a bụ ebe ndị nchịkwa mba si Britenụ were dịka nke ha ya mere ọ bụrụ na ị na-achọ maka akaebe nke nchịkwa ókèala ahụ gara aga, ebe a bụ ebe dị mma ịmalite."" This ""ebe a"" is referencing the land reclaimed on the northern coast. So the Northern Oke osimiri (Northern Shore) is the area most likely to appeal to a visitor interested in Hong Kong's colonial past.
"
Ebee ka onye njem nke ji vista na-akpali akpali kpọrọ ihe ga-achọ ịga?,"The correct answer is **D: Oghere mmiri dị na Kowloon**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Ịhụta Họng Kọng n'ụzọ kachasị mma, pụọ n'agwaetiti gawa na Kowloon, mpaghara akụkụ mmiri, nke chere gị ihu."" (To see Hong Kong in the best way, leave the island and go to Kowloon, the waterfront district, which faces you.) This indicates that Kowloon's waterfront offers the most impressive vista.
"
Kedu ihe dị iche iche nke sadulu dị iche iche na-ebelata ohere nke onye na-agba ịnyịnya ga-adaba n'ụkwụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Ogwe nche**

The passage states that ""some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the leather to detach from the saddle if the rider is pulled backwards when falling."" This directly addresses how certain saddles reduce the risk of a rider getting stuck.
"
Kedu njirimara akpụkpọ ụkwụ na-eme ka nchekwa onye na-agba ya dịkwuo mma mgbe ị na-eji ihe mkpali?,"The passage states: ""ọtụtụ n’ime ndị na-anya na-eyi akpụkpọ ụkwụ ọnyịnya ndị nwere kọị kọị na okpuru dị nrọ ma pee mpe."" This implies that a heel and a thin sole are features that enhance safety. Out of the options provided, the only option that reflects this is ""C: Ikiri ụkwụ"" (heel). So the answer is C.
"
Kedu ọrụ netwọk mgbanwe ọbịa na-enye ndị njem?,"The correct answer is **A: Ndị ọbịa na mpaghara maka ebe obibi**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that hospitality exchange networks ""connect travelers with locals in the communities they are traveling to"". It then goes on to say that people volunteer to host, offering accommodation.

The other options are not supported by the text:

*   **B:** The passage mentions a cheap flight that inspired the creation of Couchsurfing, but hospitality exchange networks don't provide or arrange cheap flights.
*   **C:** The passage doesn't mention local guides or tours being part of the service.
*   **D:** While travelers might meet other travelers, the core function described is about connecting with locals for accommodation."
"Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara netwọk maka mgbanwe ile ọbịa bụ nke na-abụghị eziokwu, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **A: A na-enye ndị njem nlegharị anya mgbe niile maka ndị ọbịa obodo.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""A ga-enyekwa, n'akwụkwọ na/maọbụ n'ịntanetị, aha ụfọdụ ndị dị njikere ịnabata..."" - which indicates a list *may* be provided, but not always.

    *   C: ""A ga-enyekwa, n'akwụkwọ na/maọbụ n'ịntanetị, aha ụfọdụ ndị dị njikere ịnabata""

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that hostels primarily attract young people – those in their twenties (""ndi obia na abiakari no n’afo agbata iri-abuo"").
*   While other types of guests might be present (solo travelers, occasional families), the dominant demographic is young adults in their twenties.
*   The options provided are the only valid options from the available selections."
"Kedu onye, dịka ederede, ọ ga-abụ na ọ ga-anọ na ụlọ mbikọ?","The best answer is **B: otu ndị dị afọ 22 atọ nọ n'okporo ụzọ**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that hostels primarily attract young travelers, especially those in their twenties (""Ulo-obia na elekota karisia ndị na-eto eto – ndi obia na abiakari no n’afo agbata iri-abuo""). A group of 22-year-olds fits this description perfectly.
*   The passage mentioned that hostels rarely house families with children and offer private rooms for them.
*   The passage only mentioned the fact that travelers other than young adults can sometimes be found there."
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-ekwu gbasara ịtụba boomerang bụ eziokwu, dịka akụkụ akwụkwọ akụkọ ahụ siri dị?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: Ọtụtụ boomerangs nwere ike ịlaghachi, mana ọ bụghị ha niile**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Ọbụrụ na ị chọrọ ịmụta ka esi atụ bumerang nke na alaghachikwute gị ma Ị tụpụ ya, gbalịa hụ na Ị nwere nke na alaghachikwute alaghachikwute."" This implies that not all boomerangs are designed to return.
*   It also mentioned that ""Oka-na-onuogugu igba-okirikiri di na mba Australia bu n’ezie nke na anaghi alaghachi azu."" This directly confirms that some boomerangs are not designed to return.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   A: The passage doesn't guarantee that the boomerang will *always* return if thrown properly.
*   B: The passage only mentioned that tourists are interested in learning how to throw boomerangs, not necessarily prefer them.
*   C: The passage only suggests that Australia is home to boomerangs that do not return."
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-eme ka ọtụtụ nri Javanese?,"The correct answer is **C: sugar mere si aki oyibo** (sugar made from coconut).

The passage states: ""Ndị Java kara nwee mmasị na ya ndị nke bụ ahụekere achịcha kpuchiri, ose, shuga (tụmadị shuga akị Ndị Java) na ngwa nrị ndị ọzọ nwere usi ọma."" This clearly indicates that Javanese cuisine favors coconut sugar.
"
Paragraf a na-ajụ ka ọrịa na-efe efe si eto?,"The correct answer is **A: Ndị na-arịa ọrịa**.

The paragraph defines ""contagious"" as an illness that can be transmitted by being near someone who has the illness. Therefore, the paragraph explains how contagious diseases spread: through contact with infected individuals.
"
"Kedu ihe na-enweghị ugbu a ama ama etiology ọrịa na-efe efe, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: Ịgba ọgwụ mgbochi ọrịa**.

Here's why:

The passage states that infectious diseases are caused by pathogens like viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites. Vaccination is a *preventative measure* against infectious diseases, not a cause of them. Therefore, vaccination does not have a known etiology, based on the passage. The other options (B, C, and D) are explicitly listed as potential causes of infectious diseases.
"
N'ọnọdụ ndị dị aṅaa ka onye na-azụ ahịa ga-enwe afọ ojuju na proxy webụ karịa ndị na-eweta VPN nke ha?,"The correct answer is **C: Ọtụtụ ndegharị okporo ụzọ onye ọrụ bụ maka http**.

Here's why:

*   **The Argument in P**: The passage argues that VPNs are generally better than web proxies because they handle *all* internet traffic, offer higher bandwidth, and are more difficult to detect.
*   **The Question**: We are asked to identify a scenario where a web proxy would *satisfy* a user *better* than a VPN.
*   **Analyzing the Options**:
    *   **A**: Wrong. The argument supports that VPNs change all traffic for the user, so a web proxy would not be better.
    *   **B**: Wrong. VPNs are harder to detect, thus better at staying out of sight and surveillance.
    *   **C**: **Correct**. If most of a user's traffic is HTTP, a web proxy might be sufficient and more economical, as VPNs offer functionality beyond what is needed. The argument made states proxies only do HTTP.
    *   **D**: Wrong. The argument supports that VPNs offer higher bandwidth than proxies.

Therefore, a web proxy is superior to a VPN when HTTP traffic is the primary traffic, as they are built to handle it while VPNs are not built with HTTP in mind."
"Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara VPN na proxies webụ bụ nke na-abụghị eziokwu, dabere na akụkụ ahụ?","Azịza ziri ezi bụ **D: Naanị http okporo ụzọ VPN nwere ike ibugharị ya**.

Kedu ihe kpatara na mmadụ ga-eji ekwentị na-eweta ekwentị na-anọghị n'akụkụ ya nso?,"The correct answer is **A: Oku ekwentị dabere na ịntanetị**.

The passage explicitly states that making calls over the internet allows you to bypass traditional phone companies and choose a phone number in a different location. This is the defining characteristic of internet-based calling (VoIP).
"
"Kedu ihe enwere ike ịchọrọ, dabere na akụkụ ahụ, iji nweta ụfọdụ oku?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: Nye iwu ekwentị PSTN**.

The passage states that you often need to translate a public phone number so that PSTN phones can call you. This implies that to receive certain calls (specifically from traditional PSTN phones), you need to have provisioned a PSTN phone number somehow.  The passage explicitly says you *don't* need a local phone company (B), a local number (C), or to obtain an international number, so those options are incorrect.
"
Kedu n'ime okwu ndị a bụ ụgha gbasara etu esi akpọ okwu Italian?,"The correct answer is **D: Ọtụtụ aha nwere mkpọpụta dị iche iche dabere na ụdaume na-esote**.

Here's why:

*   **P states:** that **c and g** change pronunciation based on the following vowel. It **does not say** that many names have different pronunciations based on the following vowel.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: Mkpọpụta nke abụọ r dị iche na nke otu r** - This is TRUE. P says to ensure that ""r"" and ""rr"" are pronounced differently giving the example of caro (dear) and carro (carriage).
*   **B: A na-ekwu ọtụtụ okwu n'otu ụzọ e si dee ya** - This is TRUE. P states that ""Italian pronunciation is fairly straightforward as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.""
*   **C: Ụfọdụ okwu na-eji mkpụrụedemede c na g nwere ike bụrụ ihe ịma aka.** - This is TRUE. P stated that ""The main consonants to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies based on the vowel that follows""."
Kedu n'ime àgwà Izmir ndị a dị tupu ugbu a?,"Given the information in the passage, Izmir was previously the ancient city of Smyrna. None of the other options (wide boulevards, bottle-fronted houses, large shopping centers, red-tile roofs) are explicitly stated as existing *before* the present-day Izmir. Thus, none of options A, B, C, or D is correct.

However, if the question is asking which of the listed features are described as being *older or more established* within the context of the present-day city, then the answer would be **D: Tile elu ụlọ na-acha uhie uhie**. The passage mentions traditional red-tile roofs in relation to the 18th-century shops and mosques, suggesting they are a long-standing architectural feature.
"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị eziokwu gbasara Izmir?,"The correct answer is **D: Ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri dị na Turkey bụ nke abụọ kasị ukwuu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Izmir is the second-largest port **after Istanbul**, implying it's not the second largest overall.
*   The other options are true based on the passage:
    *   A: ""wubere gburugburu otu nnukwu ọnụ mmiri ma ụmụ ugwu gbaakwa ya gburugburu""
    *   B: ""nkwụrụ nke kara bụrụ Mediterranean Yurop""

"""Kedu ihe a na-ahụ mgbe ejiri okwu """"hanami"""" mee ihe?""","The correct answer is **A: Ifuru cheri**.

The passage states that cherry blossom viewing is known as ""hanami"".
"
Ònye haziri nnọkọ mbụ maka ikiri ifuru cherry?,"The correct answer is **C: Alaeze Ukwu Japan**

The passage states ""Na Japan, Onye eze Emperọ haziri mmemme mkpụrụ osisi cheri izizi maka naanị ya na ndị otu ndị ọzọ na-ahụ maka ọchịchị Ụlọ ikpe etiti."", meaning that the Japanese emperor organized the first cherry blossom viewing party.

*   **Historical sites:** ""Jerusalem nwere otutu ebe ihe mere mgbe ochie""
*   **Cultural offerings:** ""na ebe omenala""

Therefore the correct answers are A, C, and D.
Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{A, C, D}$"
Kedu nke n'ime ihe ndị a na-akọwaghị dịka njirimara Jerusalem?,"The answer is **B: Ike ọchịchị (Political power)**.

Here's why:

*   **Akụkọ na-akpali mmasị (Interesting history):** The passage mentions Jerusalem's rich history spanning thousands of years.
*   **Mkpa okpukperechi (Religious importance):** The passage explicitly states Jerusalem is a holy city for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
*   **Ebe akụkọ ihe mere eme (Historical sites):** The passage mentions that Jerusalem has many historical and cultural sites.

The passage discusses Jerusalem's status as Israel's capital, which implies political power, but doesn't delve into details of its political influence or specific power structures. Therefore, ""political power"" is the characteristic least described in the passage."
"Kedu ụdị njem nlegharị anya, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri kwuo, agaghị enweta uru site na ịzụrụ Kaadị ọhịa?","The correct answer is **B: Onye njem nlegharị anya na-agafe na Kruger National Park**

*   **The text states:** ""...ike iba uru ka mmadu gote Kaadi Ohia nke ga-enye gi ikikere iji banye na ogige ahoputagoro na South Africa ma o bu na Ogige Kemba South Africa niile."" This means the Wild Card is beneficial for people visiting multiple parks, or even just one specific park, depending on the card purchased.
*   **Option B** describes someone simply passing through the park. If they are only visiting for a single day, they may not benefit financially from purchasing a card that would be more beneficial to someone who may spend longer time there or visit multiple parks.

The other options are not the correct answers because:

*   **Option A:** The text states the card is of benefit if you want to visit all the parks
*   **Option C:** Depending on how much the ""Ụgwọ nchekwa n mbanye a na-akwụ"" is versus the price of the card, purchasing the card would save money overall, which the tourist on a tight budget would find beneficial.
*   **Option D:** The text states the card is of benefit if you want to visit more than one park"
Kedu otu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị eziokwu gbasara ogige ntụrụndụ Kruger?,"The correct answer is **C: N'ime ogige ntụrụndụ mba South Africa niile, ọ bụ nke kacha nta** (In all South African national parks, it is the smallest).

The passage states that Kruger National Park is considered one of the best of South African National Parks (SANParks), but it does not say it's the *smallest*. The other options are all explicitly mentioned as true in the passage.

"N'ime akụkụ ndị dị n'elu ugwu ahụ, olee nke nwere ike itinye ndị na-arị elu n'ihe ize ndụ?","The correct answer is **A: Mmiri ozuzo ihu igwe**.

The passage states that the summit can be dangerous, especially when it's wet (""tụmadị mgbe dị mmiri mmiri, dị ka o nwere ike ịbụ ihe egwu ngwa ngwa""). This indicates that rainy weather poses a risk to climbers. The other options are not explicitly mentioned as posing a danger.

The passage states: ""na mpaghara ala nke eriri igwe na - enye aka ijide onwe gi ofuma"" which translates to ""in areas where it is more level, a cable acts as a handrail for additional support.""

The other options are supported by the text:

*   **A:** ""na-atụ anya ịpụ n’ume"" translates to ""expect to be out of breath.""
*   **C:** ""Enwere obere ọgba dị nso n’elu a na-aga-agaferịrị"" translates to ""There is a small cave near the top that has to be traversed.""
*   **D:** ""tụmadị mgbe dị mmiri mmiri, dị ka o nwere ike ịbụ ihe egwu ngwa ngwa"" translates to ""especially when it is wet, as it can quickly become dangerous."""

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states ""A na-ejikarị hangi ahụ isi nri abalị otu ụdị ahụrụahụ keọdịnala"" (Hangi is often used to cook traditional feasts). Traditional feasts are generally not considered to be ""roasted food.""

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

*   **A: A na-eji nkume dị ọkụ na-ekpo ọkụ na-ekpo ọkụ na geothermal hangi iji kpoo olulu ahụ** (Heated stones are used to heat the hole in geothermal hangi). The passage says ""A na-eji okwute si n'ọkụ eme ka olulu a dị ọkụ, maọbụ n'ụfọdụ ebe ọkụ si n'ime ala n'eme ka ala dị ọkụ n'onwe ya."" (The pit is heated by hot stones or, in some places, the ground is heated naturally by underground heat).
*   **B: Wellington na-enye hangi nke ejiri okwute ọkụ mee** (Wellington offers hangi made with hot stones) The passage states ""enwere ike ilele hangi ndị ọzọ na Kraịstchọch, Wellịntụn na ebe ndị ọzọ"" (other hangi can be viewed in Christchurch, Wellington, and other places).
*   **D: Na Rotorua, e nwere geothermal hangi** (In Rotorua, there are geothermal hangi). The passage says ""Ọtụtụ ebe na Rotorua na enye jiotemal hangi"" (Many places in Rotorua offer geothermal hangi)."

*   Skirts that cover the knees for women
*   Wraps to cover shoulders for women
*   Trousers that cover the knees for men

The passage **does not** mention any kind of shirt being available for loan. Thus the correct answer is:

**A: Uwe elu**

"Mgbe ọ na-eme njem n'akụkụ ụfọdụ nke Antarctica, olee mgbe onye njem ga-enwe ohere kacha mma ịhụ kpakpando?","The correct answer is **C: Oge oyi**.

The passage explicitly states that ""if you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions during the winter you will experience the polar night... This provides an excellent opportunity to see the Aurora borealis, as the sky will be completely dark for longer around the clock."" And further states ""as these regions are not very populated, and therefore light pollution is not usually a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.""

Therefore, winter is the best time to see stars in Antarctica, according to the passage.

The passage explicitly states that you need to be ""in the open"" and have a ""clear path to see a satellite"" to make a phone call using a satellite phone.  This means any obstruction blocking the line of sight to the satellite would prevent its use.
"
Kedu mgbe ọ ka mma iji ekwentị satịlaịtị kama iji ekwentị mkpanaaka?,"Based on the provided passage, the best answer is **B: Mgbe na njem nlegharị anya ụgbọ mmiri**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that satellite phones are useful ""n'ebe ndị zopuru ezopu, n'enweghị netwọk ekwentị"" (in remote locations without cellular networks).
*   It also mentions that satellite phone service is used ""by the shipping industry, including pleasant craftsmanship, with distant explorers who need remote data and voice"". A cruise ship tour clearly falls into this category.
*   Options A and D suggest situations where cellular service would likely be available. Option C makes no sense, as the text mentions that satellite phones can be used for data."
E hiwere Transnistria Republic n'ihi esemokwu nke kedu n'ime ndị a?,"The correct answer is **B: Agbụrụ**.

The passage states that Moldova is a multi-ethnic country that has suffered from ethnic tensions. These tensions led to the secession of Transnistria.
"
"N'adịghị ka ndị Moldova ndị ọzọ, olee otu n'ime ihe ndị a pụrụ iche na Transnistria Republic?  ","The correct answer is **D: Ego**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""N'afọ 1994, ọgbaaghara a butere nkepụta Mba Transnistria kenkwupụta-onwe n'ime ebe ọwụwaanyanwụ Moldova, nke nwere ọchịchị na **ego nke ya** mana onweghi mba ọbụla so n'otu UN nabatara ya."" (In 1994, this conflict led to the self-proclaimed secession of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and **currency** but is not recognized by any UN member state.)

*   The passage does not indicate that Transnistria is different in terms of language, religion, or UN recognition."
Edemede a na-atụ aro oge dị mma iji gaa Montevideo ma ọ bụrụ na ịchọrọ ịnọpụ na ikuku?,"The correct answer is **C: Mgbe oge okpomọkụ na-arị elu na Northern Hemisphere**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Montevideo has summer when the Northern Hemisphere has winter, and vice versa. So, the summer in Montevideo coincides with winter in the Northern Hemisphere
*   The question asks when is a good time to visit to avoid extreme temperatures.
*   To avoid the cold and ""icy"" winter conditions described in the passage, you'd want to visit during Montevideo's summer. Montevideo's summer is when the Northern Hemisphere is experiencing its summer (i.e. when ""oge okpomọkụ na-arị elu na Northern Hemisphere"".
*   Thus, option C would be correct.

The other options are incorrect:

*   A: Visiting during the Northern Hemisphere's winter would mean experiencing Montevideo's summer, which isn't the worst time to visit, but the question wants you to avoid extremes, and there is a chance of extreme temperatures over 30°C.
*   B: The passage explicitly states there is no ""dry season"" in Montevideo.
*   D: Visiting during Montevideo's winter is not ideal, as it can be very cold and uncomfortable due to humidity and wind."
"Kedu mgbe mmadụ kwesịrị ịga Montevideo ma ọ bụrụ na ọ na-ahọrọ okpomọkụ dị jụụ, dịka akụkụ nke akwụkwọ ahụ si kwuo?","The passage states that Montevideo is south of Iquitos, meaning it experiences seasons opposite to the Northern Hemisphere. It also says that during the summer months, temperatures often exceed +30°C. Therefore, if someone prefers mild temperatures, they should avoid Montevideo during its summer.

Option B states ""When the Northern Hemisphere is in its summer"". This means Montevideo is in its winter. This aligns with the need to avoid summer temperatures.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Mgbe Northern Hemisphere bụ n'oge okpomọkụ ya**

The question asks which option would strongly associate graffiti with artistry rather than vandalism. Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Ihe omume metụtara ihe odide (Art-related events):** This clearly connects graffiti to the art world. An established graffiti artist is more likely to participate in art events, like exhibitions or competitions.

*   **B: Ide ederede (Writing):** While writing is a component of some graffiti, it doesn't necessarily differentiate art from vandalism. Both can involve writing.

*   **C: Mgbidi dị n'ihe onwunwe ọha na-achọghị (Unwanted walls on public property):** This strongly suggests vandalism, as it implies the graffiti is unwelcome and possibly illegal.

*   **D: Mkpado enweghị ike ịgụ (Illegible tags):** This is more indicative of random tagging or vandalism than intentional artistic expression.

Therefore, the option that most strongly links graffiti to artistry is **A: Ihe omume metụtara ihe odide (Art-related events).**

This directly supports the idea that camping nearby is an important part of the experience for many attendees.

"Kedu ihe ndị na-eme ememme kwesịrị ibute ụzọ ma ọ bụrụ na ha chọrọ ịtọ ụlọikwuu nso n'akụkụ egwu ahụ, dị ka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **D: Na-abịa ngwa ngwa**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""nearly all listed casinos serve alcohol, and many of them bring in well-known acts (particularly those near Albuquerque and Santa Fe)."" This directly indicates that casinos near Santa Fe are a place to find well-known entertainment.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: awa abụọ site na Albuquerque, na cha cha:** While casinos near Albuquerque also have entertainment, the passage emphasizes Santa Fe as a specific location. Also, ""two hours from Albuquerque"" isn't directly stated.
*   **B: Na pueblo dị anya:** The passage implies that you WON'T find nightlife in most pueblos.
*   **D: N'ụlọ mmanya dị n'ógbè ahụ:** The passage specifically warns against small, local bars due to the issue of drunk driving in the area."
Kedu ụdị mmanya ndị njem nlegharị anya na mmefu ego siri ike ga-achọ ịnọpụ na ya?,"The correct answer is **D: Ihe ọṅụṅụ mere site na mkpụrụ osisi**

The text states that ""Mmanya mkpụrụ osisi dị ọnụ mana ha amaka"" (""Fruit juices are expensive but good""). Because they are expensive, a tourist on a tight budget would want to avoid them.
"
Kedu n'ime iwu ihe ọṅụṅụ ndị a nwere ike ịghọtahie onye na-echere na ọnọdụ a kọwara n'amaokwu a?,"The correct answer is **D: Flat white**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""For Australians, a 'flat white' coffee is an alien thing."" This means if someone orders a ""flat white"" in the described setting (presumably Australia), it would cause confusion because it's not a common or understood drink.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: Shọt blak:** The passage explains that a ""shot black"" is the same as an ""espresso"", so ordering this wouldn't cause confusion.

*   **B: Otu Nọmba Mbụ:** The passage describes this as a local beer, so ordering it would be perfectly understandable.

*   **C: Sitere na New Zealand, Sauvignon Blanc:** The passage suggests New Zealand wine is good to drink, so ordering it would not cause confusion.
"
"Kedu ebo malitere oge ọchịchị, nke were narị afọ atọ?","The correct answer is **D: Ndị Spanish**.

The passage states: ""Ndị Spen bidoro oge ọchịchị ike nke digidere ruo narị afọ atọ."" (The Spanish started a period of strong governance/colonial rule that lasted three centuries).
"
"Kedu ụzọ kacha mma iji merie onye Parisi, dị ka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **C: Nwee nkwanye ùgwù**.

The passage states that the best way to navigate Paris and avoid negative interactions with Parisians is to be ""bien élevé"" (well-mannered) and show basic politeness. This aligns directly with being respectful. The passage doesn't mention learning Parisian opinions, being assertive, or being outgoing.
"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị àgwà ndị Parisi, dị ka ekwuru n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **D: Mberede**.

The passage mentions *isi, nganga na mpako* (stubbornness, pride, and arrogance) as perceived traits of Parisians. *Ịgba aghara* (quarrelsome) and *egwuregwu egwu* (teasing/playful) aren't mentioned, but *mpako* (arrogance/pride) is directly mentioned.  *Mberede* (suddenness) is not mentioned at all.
"
Kedu uru dị na ịnya klaasị mbụ na MetroRail na Cape Town?,"The correct answer is **B: ọnụ ọgụgụ dị nta nke ndị mmadụ**.

The passage states: ""MetroPlus ka mma maka ezumike ma nwekwaa ọnụ ọgụgụ ndị mmadụ pere mpe karịa..."". This directly indicates that one of the benefits of MetroPlus (first class) is a smaller crowd.
"
"Kedu ihe dị n'ọdụ ụgbọ oloko ọ bụla na Cape Town, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **D: Ndị nkuzi nke mbụ na nke atọ**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Ụgbọ oloko ọ bụla nwere ma MetroPlus ma Koochi gasị."" MetroPlus bụ ngalaba nke mbụ (first class) and the passage also states that Metro is third class.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A:** The passage says MetroPlus has fewer people.
*   **B:** The passage says MetroPlus is slightly more expensive.
*   **C:** The passage mentions only two classes (first and third)."
Kedu nke n'ime ihe ndị a na-agaghị ekwe omume ka ahụhụ anụmanụ mee?,"The correct answer is **A: Mee otu n'amaghị ama**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that pests can spoil food, cause irritation, cause allergic reactions, spread venom, or spread disease.
*   While pests can cause harm or death, this is usually not done unknowingly (option A).

Therefore, option A is the least likely thing for a pest to do."
Ebee ka m nwere ike nweta kaadị ekwentị akwụgoro ụgwọ?,"The passage states: ""Ahịa nkuku juputara na kaadị mkpọtụ ekwentị akwụgo ụgwọ...""

Therefore, the answer is **C: ụlọ ahịa nkuku**.

This translates to: ""Access to these services is through telephone numbers in the free call that can be called free of charge from many of the phones.""

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Site n'enyemaka nke ọnụọgụ ego efu (Through the help of toll-free numbers).

"Kedu otu n'ime osisi ndị a na-adịkarị obere na ogige ntụrụndụ mba nke Plitvice Lakes, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri kwuo?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is:

**C: Fir**

The passage states: ""Ebe nnọkọọha mba nke Ụmụ ndọrọ mmiri Plitvice nwere oke ọhịa, nwejuru ụmụ osisi beech, spruce, na fir..."" which translates to ""Plitvice Lakes National Park has a large forest, mostly populated with beech, spruce, and fir trees..."" This implies that fir is one of the dominant tree types in the park, not necessarily rare. The passage doesn't provide any information to suggest that oak or hardwood trees are less common.
"
Kedu n'ime anụ ọhịa ndị a na-adịghị ahụkebe nwere ike ịhụ na Plitvice Lakes National Park?,"The correct answer is **D: Capercaillie**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions ""anụ ọhịa bea ndị Yurop na-acha uri, agụ owulu, ugo, ikwiikwii, nwamba oke ọhịa linz"" as animals of the unique habitat that are rarely seen, but it does not mention ""toro toro"", ""agba mmanụ aṅụ"", or ""cassowary"". The only one listed is ""Capercaillie"" which is the translation for ""Ugo"" (eagle)."
"Kedu ihe koodu mpaghara na-enyere aka n'ezie, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **B: Ike n'elu ahịa**

The passage states: ""Uru ọ bara n'ezie bụ ịme ka ụlọ ọrụ gasị nwee ikikere ebe ahịa ha nọ"". This directly means the code is used to help companies maintain power over their market.
"
"Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara koodu mpaghara bụ ụgha ma ndị ụlọ ọrụ mgbasa ozi na-agbasa, n'akụkụ a?","The passage directly contradicts option B. It states that region codes don't affect copyright infringement.

Therefore, the answer is **B: Ha na-enye aka n'igbochi piracy** (They help prevent piracy).
"
Kedu usoro a na-emekarị mgbe ị na-abanye na obodo gị?,"The passage describes the steps involved when entering your home country, focusing on the potential challenges with customs. The best answer, based on the passage, is:

*   **D: Njikwa nke kọstọm** (Customs control)

While the passage also mentions immigration, it emphasizes the issues related to customs. The passage does not explicitly discuss items A, B, or C.
"
Kedu n'ime ozi ndị a ka ị kwesịrị ịma tupu ị gaa obodo gị?,"The best answer is **D: Ma anabatara ma ọ bụ na ọ bụghị nke ngwaahịa ị na-ebu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes the importance of knowing what items are allowed and prohibited by customs. It specifically advises you to be aware of these rules and to declare any questionable items.
* While B is also relevant, D is the broader and more encompassing answer.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as good:

*   **A: Ma a ga-enwe ebe nnyocha maka mbata na ọpụpụ:** The passage says immigration might not be common, which can be useful but it isn't the most important thing to know.
*   **C: Ọ bụrụ na etinyere njikwa kọstọm:** The passage mentions customs controls (njikwa kọstọm) will happen."
"Kedu ihe bara ụba na Ndagwurugwu Cochamó, dị ka akụkụ ahụ siri dị, nke na-enye ndị na-arị elu ohere ịchọta ụzọ ọhụrụ ebe ahụ mgbe niile?","The correct answer is **D: Mgbidi** (Walls).

The passage states that Cochamó Valley has ""údị dị iche iche nke ụmụ nnukwu ahụaja kọnkịrị na nnukwu nkume"" (a variety of granite walls and boulders). It is this abundance and variety of walls that provides climbers with endless opportunities to establish new routes.
"
"Kedu onye na-eme njem kachasị na Southern Hemisphere, dịka ozi nke akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Star Alliance na-ahụ maka ihe niile belụ sọọsọ akụkụ ọwụwa anyanwụ Pasifik Ndịda...""  This means Star Alliance covers almost all transoceanic routes in the Southern Hemisphere except for a specific section. The passage mentions that SkyTeam does not cover any Southern Hemisphere routes. While LATAM operates a particular flight, it doesn't represent the largest coverage.
"
"Na Southern Hemisphere, kedu mmekorita ụgbọ elu na-enyefefe oke osimiri kacha nta?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: SkyTeam**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Onweghi nkwekorita ụgbọ elu na-ekpuchi ngafe oke osimiri atọ niile na Mpaghara Okpu Ndịda (ma SkyTeam anaghịkwa ekpuchi ngafe ọ bụla ahụ)."" This means SkyTeam covers the fewest transoceanic routes in the Southern Hemisphere (specifically, none).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Njikọ nke Stars:** The passage says Star Alliance covers almost all routes *except* the eastern part of the South Pacific.
*   **B: Ndida Pacific:** South Pacific is a geographic area, not an airline alliance.
*   **C: Ụwa nke LATAM:** LATAM is mentioned as operating a specific route (Santiago to Tahiti), implying it covers *at least* that much. It's also part of Star Alliance, so it inherits the coverage of that alliance."
Kedu ụlọ ọrụ nlegharị anya dochie Global Running Tours?,"The correct answer is **B: Running Tours**.

The passage states: ""Ndị nnọchiteanya Global Rọnịn Tọọz, Go Rọnịn Tọọz na ejikọta ọtụtụ ndị nweta mmemme ọsọ na kọntinent anọ."" This directly identifies ""Running Tours"" as the entity associated with Global Running Tours.
"
Ahịrịokwu ahụ na-ekwu na ole dị iche iche na-ahụ anya na-ejikọta site na njem na-agba ọsọ?,"The correct answer is **A: Anọ**.

The passage states that Global Running Tours connects running tour operators across ""kọntinent anọ"" (four continents).

Kedu ka ndị njem nlegharị anya ga-esi bulie ohere ha nwere ịhụ agụ n'ụzọ doro anya?,"The correct answer is **B: Gagharịa n'ime ọhịa**.

Here's why:

*   The paragraph states that lions, leopards, and cheetahs (agụ) are sometimes shy and ""you will see them better with binoculars."" Going on a walking safari (option A) wouldn't necessarily improve your chances of seeing them clearly, and might even make it harder. Walking safaris are mentioned as a completely different type of safari, separate from the standard one. It is also a dangerous way to try and view them. Using microscopes (option C) is illogical for viewing large animals in the wild. Using cars with basic equipment (option D) might give you a view of them, but that isn't the most efficient way to view them closely.
*   Option B is the closest to the advice given in the paragraph: If you use binoculars, you will see them better. Binoculars can be used while exploring in the woods.

Therefore, the answer is B."
"Kedu ụdị anụmanụ ọ ga-abụ na onye ọbịa ga-ezute mgbe ọ na-eme njem safari n'ime ụgbọ ala, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **B: Enyí**.

This directly indicates that elephants (enyi) are likely to be seen up close in a vehicle. The other animals are mentioned as being more shy and requiring binoculars to see well.
"
"Kedu ihe ga-eme njem nlegharị anya dị ọnụ ala, dabere na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: Na-achịkọta otu quartet**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that tours are cheaper for larger groups, ideally groups of ""anọ ruo isii"" (four to six) people.
*   A ""quartet"" is a group of four people.
*   The other options don't align with the suggestion to form a group of four to six for better pricing.
"
"Kedu onye ga-akacha nweta ọnụahịa njem nlegharị anya kacha mma, dabere na ebe a?","The correct answer is **D: otu mmadụ ise**.

Here's why:

*   **P** states that tours are cheaper for larger groups (4-6 people).
*   Option D describes a group of five, which falls within that optimal size.
*   The other options describe groups smaller than the ideal range.

The passage states: ""Ngosipụta ya ugboro ugboro n’egwu, ihe nkiri, edemede na omenaala ama ama nyere aka mee ka amata obodo ahụ na ihe nhụmaama ya n’ụwa niile."" This translates to: ""Its frequent appearance in music, film, literature and popular culture has helped to make the city and its attractions known worldwide.""
"
Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara San Francisco na-akwadoghị?,"The correct answer is **D: Njem nlegharị anya bụ naanị ụlọ ọrụ na-akwado akụ na ụba.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that professional services, government, finance, trade, and tourism are the major employers in San Francisco. This means tourism is one of the main contributors, but not the only one.
*   The passage does support A, B, and C:
    *   A: ""Ngosipụta ya ugboro ugboro n’egwu, ihe nkiri, edemede na omenaala ama ama"" (Frequent depictions in music, movies, literature and popular culture)
    *   B: ""San Fransisko so n'ebe kachasị mma iri nri ndị mba Eshia n'obodo: Nke mba Koria, Taị, India na Japaanụ."" (San Francisco is one of the best places to eat Asian food in the country: Korean, Thai, Indian, and Japanese).

Here's why:

*   The passage doesn't directly say that travel agents quickly prepare travel documents, but it implies that they can assist in obtaining necessary documents like visas, thus streamlining the overall travel preparation process.
*   The other options are explicitly mentioned in the passage:
    *   B: Azụmahịa na hotels (Travel agents often have business deals with specific hotels).
    *   C: Nchịkọta zuru oke (They offer packages that include breakfast, transportation, etc.).
    *   D: Na-eme ndoputa (They can make reservations)."
Kedu ikike nke ngwa ntụgharị ederede ozugbo na-akọwaghị n'akụkụ a?,"The correct answer is **D: Na-enweta izi ezi 100% na ntụgharị asụsụ**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that machine translation is improving but **not always accurate**, mentioning that translations can still be nonsensical. This directly contradicts option D.
*   Other options can be deduced from the paragraph
    *A: Akara ntụgharị asụsụ e dere n'asụsụ ndị ọzọ:* (Ụfọdụ ngwa nọ n’òtù a nwere ike ịsụgharị ngwe ndị nọ n'asụsụ mba ofesi nọ n’ụmụ nrụaka ma ọ bụ ihe ndị ọzọ n’ime ụwa n’ezie mgbe òjìàrụ ahụ chewere ekwentị-maihe ihu gakwuru ihe ndị ahụ)

Kedu ihe na-eme ka ịsụgharị akwụkwọ na-anọghị n'ịntanetị?,"The correct answer is **C: Inweta ozi asụsụ**.

The passage states that Google Translate allows for offline translation *after* the desired language has been downloaded. This act of downloading the language is precisely ""inweta ozi asụsụ"" (acquiring language data). The software update is relevant for all functionalities and will thus be excluded. "
Kedu n'ime ihe omume ndị a na-adịghị ebute oke mmiri?,"The passage states that melting snow, people, sunlight, and snowfall can all trigger avalanches. Therefore, none of those events are *not* triggers. However, the passage *implies* that it's the *unstable* snow that is the underlying problem.

Of the listed options, only **A: Melting Snow** describes the state of the snow itself, rather than an external trigger. The other options, B, C, and D, are all specific external events that can disturb the unstable snow.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: Snow na-amị amị**.
"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-ebute oke mmiri ozuzo, dị ka ekwuru n'amaokwu ahụ?","The passage mentions that avalanches can be triggered by:

*   The sun heating the snow.
*   More snow falling.
*   Other natural events.
*   Often, people.

Option D: ""Ndị mmadụ na-emetụghị ya, snow"" is the closest to something mentioned in the passage, as the passage states that it can often be triggered by people.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D**."
"Mmiri na yogọt Kedu ihe bụ ihe ndabere nke curry, dị ka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **A: Mmiri na yogọt**.

The passage states that curry can be either ""dry"" or ""wet"" depending on the amount of liquid present. It then goes on to say that yogurt is commonly used in North India and Pakistan, while coconut milk is commonly used in South India and other coastal regions. These liquids (yogurt, coconut milk, and presumably water to some extent) are the base of the curry, determining its consistency.
"
Kedu ihe curry a na-eji mmiri ara ehi aki oyi dochie oge ụfọdụ n'ebe ụfọdụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Yogurt**.

The passage states that in South India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used instead of yogurt.
"
Gịnị kpatara ugwu Transantarctic ji dị mkpa iji rute ala dị larịị?,"The correct answer is **B: Snow jikọtara ọnụ dị ize ndụ**.

The passage states that the compacted snow road has crevasses marked by flags. The special tractors and sleds cannot travel quickly, so they must go around the Transantarctic Mountains to reach the plateau. This implies the direct route is dangerous because of the snow conditions (crevasses).
"
Kedu ihe ọkọlọtọ na-egosi n'akụkụ okporo ụzọ South Pole?,"The correct answer is **C: Oghere snow kpuchie**.

The passage states: ""Sno ya kpụkọtara ọnụ nwere ọtụtụ oghere nke e jiri ọtụtọ ọkọlọtọ sụjuo ma mee akara."" This directly indicates that the flags mark snow-covered crevasses (oghere).
"
Kedu ozi dị mkpa gbasara njem na South Africa nke a na-ahapụ na akụkụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ihe achọrọ maka visa dị iche dabere na obodo ahụ**.

The passage explicitly states, ""Ihe ọchụchọ na Visa na-adà ọnụahịa dị iche site na mba ruo na mba ma metụta kwa site n’obodo i siri bịa."" This means visa requirements vary based on nationality.

Let's look at why the other options are not the *most* important omitted information:

*   **B: Iji ụgbọ ala nyocha bụ ụzọ dị mma iji hụ saịtị ndị na-apụ apụ na mbụ** This is true, and stated in the passage.
*   **C: Ihe fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ mba niile dị na South Africa nwere udo** The passage says the opposite: ""buru n'uche na ọ bụghị obodo niile gbara Sawụt Afrịka gburugburu kwụsiri ike dịka ha.""
*   **D: Ọ bụrụ na ịnya ụgbọ ala, a tụrụ aro 4x4** This is stated in the passage and not left out."
"Kedu ihe a ga-ewere na ndụmọdụ na-ekwesịghị ekwesị, dabere na akụkụ ahụ, maka ndị njem nleta na-achọ ịnya ụgbọ ala gburugburu South Africa?","The best answer is **B: Ọtụtụ ebe enwere ike iji ụgbọ ala mgbe niile, n'agbanyeghị na a tụrụ aro 4x4**

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Enwere ike ime nke a na moto nkịtị ma a kpachara anya tụọ atụmatụ mana ọ ga-aka nnọọ mma iji moto nwere ohere wiili 4x4, nakwa ọ bụ naanị ụdịrị moto a nwere ike ịbanye ụfọdụ ebe."" This clearly indicates that while a regular car *can* be used, a 4x4 is much better and necessary for certain areas. Option B misrepresents this, implying regular cars are always fine.

Let's look at why the other options are appropriate advice:

*   **A: Iwu ahụ nwere ike ịdepụta ngwa enyemaka mberede n'ime ụgbọ ala:** The passage says, ""Mba ọbụla nwekwara iwu pụrụ iche nke na-ekwu ngwa mberede nke aghaghị idi n'ụgbọala.""
*   **C: Njem ụgbọ ala dị mma maka ndị chọrọ ịpụ n'okporo ụzọ a kụrụ akụ:** The passage states: ""Iji ụgbọ ala abanye na Ndịda Afrịka bụ ụzọ dị ịtụnanya iji hụ mma mpaghara ahụ niile yana ịbanye ebe ndị na-adịghị n'ụzọ a na-esikarị eme njem nlegharị.""
*   **D: Ọ bụghị mba niile dị n'Ebe Ndịda Africa bụ ndị kacha mma maka njem:** The passage says, ""Dịka ị na-atụ atụmatụ, buru n'uche na ọ bụghị obodo niile gbara Sawụt Afrịka gburugburu kwụsiri ike dịka ha."""
Kedu ihe ize ndụ nwere ike ịhapụ akpa gị n'echeghị ya n'akwụkwọ a?,"Based on the passage, the correct answers are:

*   **B: Ị nwere ike ịmalite iburu ọgwụ n'amaghị ama** (The passage explicitly mentions being used as an unwitting drug mule.)
*   **D: Ndị ọchịchị nwere ike nyochaa ha ka ha bụrụ ịdọ aka ná ntị bọmbụ** (The passage states unattended bags attract attention from authorities fearing bombs.)
*   **A: Enwere ike iwere ha** (The passage states unattended bags become targets for theft.)

Therefore, the best answer is **A, B and D**"
Kedu maka iji ọgwụ eme ihe na-ekwughị na akụkụ ahụ?,"The best answer is **B: Mgbe ị na-eme njem na mba ofesi, ekwesịrị ịgbaso usoro nchekwa ndị ọzọ** (When traveling abroad, additional safety measures should be followed).

Here's why:

*   **The passage is primarily about being vigilant with your belongings when traveling abroad to avoid being implicated in drug trafficking or other illegal activities.** The passage warns of potential consequences of unattended bags, including being used unknowingly as a drug mule and facing severe penalties. The passage also notes the strict penalties for drug offenses in certain countries.
*   Option B aligns with the entire point of the passage, that one should be cautious when traveling abroad
*   Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

    *   **A: Ndị mejọrọ nke mbụ na mba ụfọdụ nwere ike ị nweta ntaramahụhụ ọnwụ** (First-time offenders in some countries may face the death penalty): This is mentioned in the passage, but it only focuses on one specific consequence and not the overarching advice being given.
    *   **C: Enwere ike iji nkịta zụrụ azụ ịchọpụta ọgwụ na-enweghị ịdọ aka ná ntị** (Trained dogs can be used to detect drugs without warning): This is a detail from the passage, not the main point.
    *   **D: Ọbụlagodi na ịnweghị ọgwụ n'ime akpa gị, ndị ọchịchị nwere ike ijide ha** (Even if you don't have drugs in your bag, the authorities may seize them): While it's true that authorities might hold them if the authorities suspect the bag is related to illegal activity, it's more about preventing potential drug smuggling, thus the overall message is to be cautious."
Kedu ụdị ihe ọṅụṅụ na-adịghị akwadoro dị ka ihe ị ga-agbalị ime n'ụlọ mgbe ịnọrọ?,"Based on the passage, the suggestion is to start the day with coffee and end it with chamomile tea for relaxation. When you're on a staycation, you have the opportunity to indulge in self-care and explore unique experiences. The passage also suggests experimenting with fruits to discover new breakfast drink options. Exploring local bars or pubs in areas you don't usually frequent is encouraged to sample various drinks.

The passage does not discourage making any of the listed drinks (juice, coffee, water, coffee) at home. Therefore, none of the options are specifically discouraged.

However, the phrasing implies creating a fruit-based juice might be a more creative and engaging staycation activity than just having water, coffee, or juice.

Therefore, none of the options are directly *against* the advice.

Given that, I believe a better question would be ""Which option is most likely to be tried"" which would lead to the answer being ""Juice""

Given that this question is designed to test reading comprehension and finding things that the passage discourages, then the answer should be A: Water. As that would be the most bland and boring option compared to others."
"Ọ bụrụ na obodo gị nwere aha ọma maka ịbụ obodo a na-aṅụ mmanya, kedu n'ime ihe ndị a ka ị ga-aga mgbe ị nọ?","Based on the passage, the best answer is:

**C: Ebe ị ga-aṅụ ihe ọṅụṅụ nke ị na-ezere** (A place to drink something you would otherwise avoid)

The passage explicitly suggests: ""Ọ bụrụ na i bi n’obodo nwere ọdịnala ịn̄ụ mmanya dị iche iche, gaa n'ụlọ mmanya ma ọ bụ ebe ịn̄ụ mmanya na mpaghara ị na-anaghị aga ọtụtụ oge."" This translates to: ""If you live in a city with a reputation for unique drinks, go to a bar or drinking place in an area you don't usually go."" Option C aligns with this recommendation to try drinks outside your usual preferences.
"
Ebee ka ahụrụ ihe oyiyi nduru?,"The correct answer is **B: N'ebe a na-eli ozu**.

The passage states that the dove sculptures are ""on some interesting graves"" in the churchyard. A churchyard is typically a cemetery.
"
Kedu ụdị visa ga-achọ ka mmadụ gosipụta nkwado ego zuru oke?,"The correct answer is **D: Visa ụmụ akwụkwọ**.

The passage explicitly states that for a student visa, you will need to provide proof of financial support to cover at least one academic year.
"
Kedu onye o yikarịrị ka ọ ga-achọ mgbakwunye visa ha?,"The correct answer is **C: Nwa akwụkwọ kọleji si mba ofesi** (A college student from a foreign country).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that studying abroad requires a student visa, which has different requirements and application processes than a tourist or business visa. The passage also discusses the additional requirements for student visas, such as an acceptance letter from the school and proof of financial support. Therefore, a college student planning to study abroad is the most likely candidate to need a visa and additional documentation.
"
Kedu mgbe ọ dị mkpa ka ị kpachara anya maka anwụnta?,"The best answer is **A: N'oge okpomọkụ**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that you should be wary of mosquitoes ""Karịchaa n'oge ọkọchị"" (especially in the summer). While hiking (B), in tropical forests (C), and even while driving (D) are situations where mosquitoes *might* be present, the passage emphasizes the summer season as the critical time to be cautious.
"
"Kedu ihe ị ga-akwụsị ime, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị, iji zere anwụnta mgbe ị na-eme njem na oke ọhịa?","The correct answer is **A: Ogologo oge ejiri na ọnụ ụzọ ụgbọ ala meghere**.

The passage states that even a short time with the car door open is enough for mosquitoes to get in. Therefore, reducing the amount of time the car door is open is the best way to avoid mosquitoes in the car. The other options are all conditions when one is likely to get bitten by a mosquito.
"
Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara Sundarbans na-adakọghị na ozi dị na akụkụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Ahịhịa na-ekpuchi ọkara nke mkpokọta mpaghara ya**.

Here's why:

*   **A: A na-ahụ ụfọdụ n'ime oke ọhịa ndị siri ike fọdụrụ n'ebe ahụ:** The passage mentions that the forests include remnants of old forests, so this statement aligns with the text.
*   **C: Akara mangrove kacha ibu n'ụwa niile:** The first sentence of the passage states that Sundarbans is the largest single tract of mangrove forest in the world, so this is accurate.
*   **D: Enwere mgbada ahụrụ anya ebe ahụ karịa agụ Bengal:** The passage says there are about 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer, so this statement is true.
*   **B: Ahịhịa na-ekpuchi ọkara nke mkpokọta mpaghara ya:** The passage states that one-third of the Sundarbans is covered by water or swamp, meaning that vegetation covers two-thirds of the area, not half. Thus, this statement is inaccurate."
Kedu mpaghara oke ọhịa dị na ala India?,"The correct answer is **A: Sundarbans National ọha ubi**

The passage states: ""Akụkụ nke oke ọhịa n'ime ókèala nke Indịa ka a na-akpọ Obianụọhịa Kemba Sundarbans.""

The most accurate and complete answer from the given options is Sundarbans National ọha ubi.
"
"Ònye, n'iburu n'uche paragraf ahụ, o yikarịrị ka ọ ga-enwe ma ọ dịkarịa ala iwu bụ isi nke asụsụ Bekee?","The passage states: ""N'ọtụtụ mba dị iche iche, mmadụ niile maara asụ oyibo ọfụma, ma na mba ndị ọzọ, a ga-enwe ndị matụ obere oyibo - ọkachasị ndị na-eto eto."" (In many different countries, everyone knows English well, but in other countries, there will be people who know little English - especially young people.)

This implies that **young people (ndị ntorobịa)** are *more likely* to know at least basic English compared to the older generation in some countries.

Therefore, the answer is **B: Ndị ntorobịa**.
"
"Kedu ihe nwere ike isi ike ikwu okwu, dabere na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **D: Slang mpaghara**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that accents and dialects can make spoken language difficult to understand. This is directly related to **slang mpaghara**, as slang and regional vocabulary vary widely and can be hard for outsiders to comprehend.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: ụda olu dị iche iche na nkebiokwu:** While accents and dialects contribute to difficulties in understanding spoken language, the passage focuses more on the specific vocabulary and expressions used in those dialects, which falls under the umbrella of slang mpaghara.
*   **B: Na-aza:** ""Na-aza"" means response, which is not discussed in the passage.
*   **C: Asụsụ e dere ede:** The passage states the opposite, that written language is easier to understand than spoken language."
"Kedu ihe atụ, dabere na paragraf ahụ, ga-akacha mma maka onye njem na-achọ ịnya ụgbọ ala site na ọdụ mpaghara?","The best answer is **A: Onye njem ahụ na-aga Jakar ma zụtalarị tiketi tupu oge eruo.**

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly recommends buying tickets in advance** because buses fill up quickly. Jakar is a destination mentioned as part of the eastern routes that tend to depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM and fill up fast.
*   **B is incorrect** because while the passage states that buses to Bumthang leave between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM, this is not the most advantageous thing for the traveller, according to the paragraph.
*   **C is incorrect** because Paro is best reached via taxi, not a regional bus.
*   **D is incorrect** because arriving before 6:20 AM doesn't guarantee the traveller a seat and does not necessarily improve the travel.

Therefore, answer A is the best answer."
"Site na ọdụ ụgbọ ala dị n'etiti mpaghara, kedu ndụmọdụ ị ga-enye onye njem chọrọ ịga ọwụwa anyanwụ?","The correct answer is **B: Zụrụ tiketi tupu oge eruo**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states: ""As regional connection buses are usually fully booked, it is strongly advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.""**

The other options are incorrect based on the passage:

*   **A: Mgbe 8:30 gasịrị, bọs na-apụ naanị:** The passage says buses to Jakar/Bumthang leave between 06:30 and 07:30, but it doesn't mean buses stop leaving completely after that. It only implies that the buses to those particular locations (east-bound) leave early.
*   **C: Ọtụtụ ụgbọ ala na-apụ ụbọchị niile:** The passage states that buses depart frequently throughout the day, but it still advises booking in advance due to them being full.
*   **D: Ikekwe ụdị njem kachasị ezi uche dị na ya bụ ụgbọ ala nkekọrịta:** While shared taxis are mentioned as a convenient option for *nearby* destinations (Paro, Punakha), the question is about going *east* which is a broader region. The passage doesn't imply that shared taxis are the most sensible option for long-distance travel to the east."
Kedu otu n'ime okwu ndị a kpọtụrụ aha na-abụghị eziokwu gbasara Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **C: Ụgbọ elu enweghị ike iru ebe ahụ (Airplanes cannot reach it)**

The passage states that Timbuktu *has* an airport, therefore option C is false. The other options are true:

*   **A:** The passage explicitly says Timbuktu has more Arabic influence than other parts of the country.
*   **B:** The passage implies poverty by calling it a ""dying city"".
*   **D:** The passage mentions that despite its troubles, its reputation makes it a tourist destination."
Kedu nke eziokwu Timbuktu na-abịa bụ nke ziri ezi?,"The correct answer is **A: Site n'ụgbọelu, ị nwere ike iru obodo ahụ**.

The passage states ""na o nwere otu ọdụ ụgbọelu"" (and it has one airport), which directly supports the statement that you can reach the city by plane.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kama ịbụ ogbenye, ọ dị egwu** - The passage actually states ""Taa, Timbuktu obodo agụọ na-egbu"" (Today, Timbuktu is a starving city), indicating poverty, not grandeur.
*   **C: E jiri ya tụnyere obodo ndị dị nso, ọ nwere obere mmetụta ndị Africa** - The passage states ""Obodo ahụ dị n'ọdịiche kachasị ya n'ụmụ obodo nke mba ahụ fọdụrụnụ, n'ihi na o nwere karịa mmasị nke Arabik karịa otu Onye Afrịka"" (The city is most different from the rest of the country's inhabitants because it has more of an Arabic than an African influence), implying a *smaller* African influence, making this statement accurate according to the passage.
*   **D: Obodo a abụghịzi ebe ndị njem nlegharị anya** - The passage says ""agbanyeghị n'ugwu ya na-eme ya otu ndọta ndị nleta"" (despite its hills making it a tourist attraction), indicating it *is* a tourist destination."
"Na mbụ, olee mgbe e zubere asọmpi Olympic nke oge okpomọkụ? ","The correct answer is **D: Julaị 2020**.

The passage mentions that ""ka ọ dị na Maachị gara aga ọtụtụ n'ime ụmụ iwu nkagbu dabere na njecorona agbatịghị ruo Julaị 2020, mgbe ahazirioge Olumpiks ahụ."" This indicates that the Olympics were originally scheduled for July 2020 before being rescheduled.

"Dịka ihe paseeji kwuru, site n’ebe onye njem natara ndụmọdụ gbasara ọnọdụ ndọrọndọrọ n’ebemwega obodo ha?","The passage states: ""You may consult the advice of authorities other than your own, but their advice is specifically formulated for their own citizens.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Site n’aka gọọmenti nke aka ha** (From their own government).
"
"Na mmemme nke ndụmọdụ njem, kedụ ihe ndị mbịambịa nwere ike ịhụ?","The correct answer is **B: Ụmụ nchịkọta dịkarịrị na mfe gbasara ọnọdụ ndọrọndọrọ nke obodo ahụ.**

The passage states: ""Ndị ndụmọdụ gasị bụ naanị obere nchịkọta nke ọnọdụ ndọrọndọrọ ọchịchị n’otu obodo."" This directly supports option B.

The passage also mentions A and C: ""mkpuchi ahụike njem gị ma ọ bụ mkpuchi nkagbu njem gị bụ nke o nwere ike imetụta"". However, it does not state definitively that travel advisories will affect travel insurance and health insurance and so are not the best answer.

D is incorrect because the passage says ""Uche ndị e gosipụtara na-esekarị n'elu, n'izugbe na ntọghasị dị ukwu ma a tụnyere ya ozi ndị a kọwara nke ọma dị ebe ọzọ."" which contradicts the idea that the travel advisories contain detailed information.

Here's why:

*   The passage states a travel agent is a good choice for travel that goes beyond a traveler's past experiences concerning **world, cultures, languages**, or lower-income countries. A trip involving a language barrier definitely fits the description.
*   Option A is incorrect because the passage notes that a travel agency is a good choice for travel that goes beyond a traveler's *past experience* concerning world, cultures, languages, or lower-income countries.
*   Option B may benefit from a travel agent's help but a travel agent may not be required to assist with this type of travel.
*   Option D may benefit from a travel agent's help but the passage particularly talks about language, so it is not necessarily required."
"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, kedụ ọnọdụ nke onye njem ga-enweta ihenrite site n’enyemaka nke ojeozi njem?","The correct answer is **B: Mgbe onye njem na-enwe mmasị ime bukin pụrụiche nke ezumiike n’oge mbụ**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that travel agencies are a good choice for travel that goes ""beyond the past experience of the traveler of world, culture, language or countries with low income."" This aligns with someone interested in booking a unique vacation experience for the first time.

*   The other options don't fit the context provided:
    *   **A**: Traveling to one's own country does not align with “travel that goes beyond the past experience of the traveler.”
    *   **C**: Speaking the local language would reduce the need for a travel agent, not increase it.
    *   **D**: Visiting places that resemble their own culture would not “goes beyond the past experience of the traveler.”"

Kedụ otu n’ime nke akwadoghị ndọmọdụ maka ndị njem na-aga ikwalite obodo na oge mbụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Kwụsị imefu ego na nri n’oge mbụ gị**

Here's why:

*   **P:**The passage recommends trying to live like a local and have good food to help calm nerves. This implies that spending money on food initially is acceptable.

*   **A:** The passage advises to be careful of dangerous creatures and bring protective bedding such as a hammock.

*   **C:** The passage states you should not sleep on the ground in unknown place to be safe from dangerous animals. A bed or hammock would be recommended for sleeping outdoors.

*   **D:** The passage advises to try and get comfortable lodging to ease any anxieties you might have in traveling to a new place for the first time."
Kedụ otu n’ime ndị ana-akpọghị aha dịka ihe na-eme mmefu ego mgbe ana eme nkwalite obodo?,"The correct answer is **C: Matraasi maọbụ paadị maka ụlọikwuu**.

The passage advises against sleeping directly on the ground (on a mattress or pad) when in unfamiliar territory to protect yourself from snakes, scorpions, etc., if you are camping outside. Therefore, bringing a mattress or pad for the tent is a safety measure, not a luxury or expense to be cut when trying to keep a budget.

*   **B: Na ezipụrụ onwe ha kọpị ozi-e:** Requires internet access to retrieve the email.
*   **D: Na-eme nchekwa kọpị n’ “urukpu”:** Requires internet access to access the cloud storage.

Storing the copy on the laptop's memory or a hard drive guarantees access even without the internet.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the insurance policy should contain the insurer's email address and phone number (with country code) for assistance and claims.
*   The passage does not mention including the policyholder's email address on the policy itself.
* The only options available include either the insurer or the policyholder (customer).

Therefore, the only option that isn't explicitly mentioned as being on the insurance policy is the policyholder's email address."
"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwụrụ, kedụ ebe ọjọọ gosipụtara nhakọ ihengosi ahụ nke e jikarị n’ọrụ?","The passage states: ""Ihe nlele tozuru oke nke mm35 (negetivu 36 ga na 24) bụ nke dị ebe niile."" This translates to ""The 35mm format (negative 36 by 24) was ubiquitous."" Therefore, the correct answer is:

"
Kedụ ụdị nke nhakọ ihengosi na-enye ngosipụta nke dịka nke yiri DSLR?,"The correct answer is **A: 35 mm ihengosi**.

"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwụrụ, kedụ otu n’ime ndị a ga-abụ ụzọ dị mma iji bido azụmaahịa ederede njem?","The correct answer is **A: Mụọ nhakọ weebụ**.

The passage states that the easiest way to start a travel writing career is to learn on existing travel websites. This implies learning how websites are structured and how content is formatted for online audiences.  Learning web scraping is not mentioned in the passage but is related to the first step in the passage.
"
"Mgbe Ị ga-ebido ime azụmaahịa ederede njem, kedụ ikikere ọzọ nke nwere ike ibu ụzọ mụchaa?","The correct answer is **D: Nkepụta weebụsaịtị**.

*   **This implies** that learning website creation (Nkepụta weebụsaịtị) is a natural progression after learning from travel writing websites.
*   None of the other options are directly linked to creating a website to showcase your travel writing."
Kedụ ụdịrị ọnọdụ ihuigwe a na-achọpụtakarị ọrịa eriri afọ?,"The correct answer is **C: Ekpomọọkụ ihuigwe**.

The passage states: ""n’ebe enwere okpomoku ihu igwe nje n’etoo osiso ma kwa n’ebite aka mgbe onoghi n’ahu mmadu. Ya mere, ihe otiti nke Delhi Belly, Abụmọọnụ nke Fero, Mmegwara nke Montezuma, na ọtụtụ ndị enyi ha."" This clearly links warm climates with a higher incidence of stomach illnesses.
"
"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwụrụ, ịgbananwụ o nwere ike nchekwa ahụ na gịnị?","The correct answer is **A: Ụmụ nsogbu eriri afọ (Stomach problems)**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly mentions ""Delhi Belly, Abụmọọnụ nke Fero, Mmegwara nke Montezuma"" as examples of illnesses that people can experience when travelling to places with unfamiliar bacteria.
* The passage mentions ""nsogbu eriri afọ hirine na obodo di oku"" as one of the problems that travellers can experience
* All of the diseases mentioned are types of gastrointestinal (stomach-related) illnesses.

The passage explicitly states that the Schengen area allows you to:

*   Avoid passport checks when crossing borders (supports C).
*   Apply for only one visa instead of separate visas for each member country (supports A).

Option B (Emefu obere) is implied but not explicitly stated as the text mainly emphasizes time and paperwork savings. Option D is incorrect as you still need a passport to enter the Schengen area, just not to cross internal borders.
"
Ihe nke agaghị inwe ike ịchọta n’ala ili nke Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **D: Ụba gasị** (Wealth).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that many valuable items were removed and taken to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
*   The passage notes that only the head and shoulders of the mummy are visible.
*   The passage also notes that the tomb is less decorated than other royal tombs.

While there's less decoration and wealth compared to other tombs, the passage *does* say that some items of value were there *before* they were moved.
"
"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwụrụ, kedụ ebemwega Vancouver nke ga-adị mma n’ọnụahịa maka ndị njem? ","The passage states that Whistler is expensive (oke-onu), while Bowen Island is easily accessible from Granville Island in Vancouver. There is no information about the coastlines being inexpensive.

Therefore, the best answer is **C: Agwaetiti Bowen**.
"
"Dịka paseeji kwuru, kedụ ebemwega nke nwere ike inye ndị njem ezigbo ahụmiihe pụrụiche na Vancouver?","The correct answer is **B: Whistler**.

The passage states that ""Whistler (a 1.5-hour drive from Vancouver) is expensive but well known for the 2010 Winter Olympics."" It also mentions skiing in winter and mountain biking in summer, implying that Whistler is a unique destination for visitors looking for special experiences.
"
"Dịka paseeji kwuru, kedụ mgbe ndị njem ga-aga hu mmiri na-agbapụta n’Okwute ma ọ bụrụ na ha achọghị ihe ga-egbochi ha ịhụ ihe ahụ?","Azịza ziri ezi bụ **D: Mgbe abụghị oge udùmmiri**

"Dịka paseeji kwuru, kedụ ihe bụ ọdachi ịga na Mmiri okwute Victoria Falls n’etiti Nọvembà na Marchị?","The correct answer is **A: Nlele nke enweghị mgbochi nke Ọdịda mmiri**.

The passage states that during the wet season (November to March), the mist is so intense that your view of the Falls might be obscured by it. This directly translates to ""an unobstructed view of the Falls"" being the disadvantage of visiting during that time.
"
"Dịka paseeji kwuru, kedụ nke n’ime ndị a nke akwadoghị mgbe eji drone eme ihengosi?","The correct answer is **D: Na-eme ihengosi naanị n’ebe ndị mmadụ jupụtara ebe nke agaghị enwe ike ịchọpụta drone.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Ife ngwa dron fefee ọdụ ụgbọelu maọbụ igwe mmadụ na-abụkarị ihe ọjọọ..."" This directly contradicts option D, which suggests operating a drone specifically in populated areas. The passage implies that flying a drone over crowds is *generally* not a good idea (even if not always illegal).

*   Options A, B, and C all align with the passage's emphasis on complying with regulations and permits for drone operation.

Therefore, option D is the action that is *not* supported by the passage."
"Dịka paseeji kwuru, kedụ ebe ndị kachasị mma ime ihengosi site n’iji dromụ?","The correct answer is **D: N'ebe ndị i burula ụzọ nata ikike maka ya (In places where you have already obtained permission for it).**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes adhering to the law and obtaining necessary permits. It explicitly mentions considering permits and licenses when operating a drone.  Options A, B, and C directly contradict the passage's warnings against flying near people, violating photography restrictions, or flying in populated areas. Therefore, option D is the most suitable response.
"
"Dịka e dere n’akwụkwọ, kedụ nkwupụta metụtara ndebanye aha achọrọ maka usoro visa abụghị eziokwu?","The correct answer is **B: Mba niile chọrọ ndebanye aha n’ebe ikikere otuebe ha gasị**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""Ndebanye aha so n'ihe a na-achọ n'usoro ịnweta visa"" which implies that it is not required in every country for visas.
*   All the other options are supported by the text:

    *   Option A: ""N'ọnọdụ ndị ọzọ, naanị ndị na-anọ na mpụga nke ụlọ ndị njem nleta bụ aghaghị ịdebanye aha"" suggests that if you stay in certain tourist accommodations you do not need to register.

    *   Option D: ""N'ọtụtụ obodo nwere iwu dị otu ahụ, ụlọ nkwari akụ dị gburugburu ga-ahụ maka ndebanye aha"""

"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, kedụ etu mwepụta onwe mgbe anọ n’ihenrite ofesi nyere onye njem n’ego ya?","The correct answer is **C: Ana-enye ụlọ na bọodụ mgbe ụfọdụ.**

The passage states: ""Ọ nwekwara ike bụrụ ezigbo ụzọ iji gbatịa nhazi mmefu ego inye ohere ịnọtukwu ogologo oge n'otu ebe ebe ọ bụ na ọtụtuụ ọrụ akwụghị ụgwọ na-enye ọnụụlọ na ụgbọ ma ole na ole na-akwụ obere ụgwọ ọnwa.""

This directly translates to: ""It can also be a great way to stretch your budget, allowing you to stay longer in one place because many unpaid jobs offer accommodation and transportation, and a few pay a small salary.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly mentions that room and board are *sometimes* provided, which is option C. The other options are not the primary reason given for how volunteering helps financially.
"
"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, kedụ ihe e nwere ike inabata dịka ezigbo nhatanha nke njem iji Chere Disney World?","The passage describes a ""typical"" Walt Disney World trip as:

*   Flying into Orlando International Airport.
*   Taking a bus to a Disney resort on-site.
*   Spending about a week without leaving Disney property.

Based on these components, the answer should be:
**C: Nọrọ njem niile ahụ n’akụrụngwa Disney** (Spend all the trip on Disney property)

This is the most encompassing and accurate summary of the ""typical"" Disney World trip described in the passage.
The other options are components of this trip but not complete in themselves."
Kedụ otu n’ime nkwupute a banyere Walt Disney World bụ nke abụghị eziokwu?,"The correct answer is **A: Tiketi nke mbanye ọdụ egwuregwu nwere ike site n’aka fere n’aka ndị njem ndịọzọ**.

The passage explicitly states that Disney does not allow ticket transfers: ""Disney anaghi ekwe: i gaghi enye onye ozo tiketi gi.""  Therefore, the statement that tickets can be transferred is false according to the passage.
"
"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, kedụ nsogbu nke e nwere ike ikpuchi n’ọzụzụ nke klassi ọkachamara maọbụ na mbipụta ga?","The correct answer is **C: Nkwado mpaghara agha**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Ụmụ akwụkwọ na magaziini ndị na-akọ maka nlanarị nke ọzara juru eju, mana ụmụ mbipụta na-akọ maka ebe a na-alụ agha dị obere."" This directly implies that information and training related to survival and support in active war zones are lacking.
*   The other options are mentioned as aspects of the training, but the passage explicitly points out the deficiency in war zone survival information."
"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, kedụ isiokwu ga nke i nwere ike imecha na klassi ọzụzụ ọkachamara?","The correct answer is **A: Ọgwụgwọ mbụ**.

The passage specifically mentions ""ọtụtụ mgbata ọsọ enyemaka mbụ"" as part of the training. While battlefield tactics might be touched upon (mention of ""ọzụzụ maka ngwaagha n'oge ụfọdụ""), the focus is on survival skills and emergency first aid. The passage also contrasts battlefield survival with desert survival, implying that desert survival is not the primary focus of the training.
"
"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, kedụ nhọrọ kachasị ibe ya mma iji gbochie mmebi mmiri ọṅụṅụ?","The correct answer is **B: Zụta mmiri e siri n’ọkụ**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that if you have concerns about water purification effectiveness, you should consider ""buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company."" This directly supports option B.

The other options are not the most reliably safe according to the passage:

*   Boiling for a minute might be enough in *some* places, but the passage implies it's not universally safe.
*   The passage mentions sie mmiri n'ọkụ ọtụtụ nkeji
*   Filtering with a myo na-adị iche n’ịdị irè, may not be sufficient, especially if you are unsure of the filter's quality.
*   The passage does not mention D: Nyochaa mmiri ahụ maka ụmụ nje ama"
"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, kedụ ihe nwere ike ịra ahụ ọ bụrụgodu ndị nwere ǹkà igwu mmiri?","The correct answer is **C: Igwu mmiri na mmiri na-ebu ebu**.

The passage states that deaths often occur due to exhaustion from trying to swim back against the current of a rip current, which is what ""mmiri na-ebu ebu"" (rip current) refers to. The passage emphasizes the strength of the current and the futility of fighting it directly.
"
Gịnị ka i nwere ike ime iji dọta gị n’obubu?,"The correct answer is **C: Gwuo mmiri n’ụzọ ọzọ**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Gbalịa tụọ atụmatụ ọzọ maka ebe ejidebeghi gị"" This means try swimming in a direction that is not the current."
"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, kedụ ebendobe nke ị ga n’ụlọ ukwu ga-abụ ihe ziri ezi n’ọpụpụ mkpagharị ezumiike?","The correct answer is **C: Na Ndagwurugwu Rhine**.

The passage specifically mentions visiting ""ụmụ nnukwu ụlọ n'ime Ndagwurugwu Loire, Ndagwurugwu Rhine"".
"
"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, kedụ otu n’ime ndị a ga-abụ ọkachamara akwadoro maka ụmụnwanyị na-eme njem na ogige ahụ?","Based on the passage, the best answer is:

*   **B: Mara maka ọdịiche nke omanaala nwere ike mkpalite agwà n’uju site na otuebe** and **D: Jiri atachi obi mgbe ọ dị mkpa**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that women should be aware that cultural differences might lead to what they perceive as unwanted advances.
*   The passage also explicitly states that women should be firm in saying no and not be afraid to shout if necessary.

While the passage mentions marriage status and jewelry, it *recommends* declaring marriage and wearing a ring (though not an expensive-looking one), not avoiding the topic or jewelry altogether."
"Site n’ebe akọwara na paseeji ahụ, kedụ ihe ga-enye aka maka ụmụ nwanyị ndị njem?","The correct answer is **D: N’ọnọdụ eleghara anya na nrata niile ị na-enweta, kwụrụ chim n’ịjụ ụmụnwoke** (In the face of any advances or harassment you receive, be firm in refusing men).

Here's why:

*   The passage advises women to be firm in saying no to men and not to be afraid to disagree, emphasizing the need for assertiveness.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mata na ọdịchaghị mfe iso mmadụ** (Know that it is not easy to be with people): The passage doesn't say this. It talks about specific cultural differences and how they might lead to unwanted attention.
*   **B: Yiri ọla aka buru ibù iji gosipụta ọnọdụ alụmdi** (Wear a heavy ring to show marital status): The passage advises wearing a ring, but specifically states it shouldn't look too expensive.
*   **C: Ghọta na ndịiche dị n’omenala nyere atụmatụ mgbanahụ ịkwụrụ chim** (Understand that cultural differences provide an escape plan to pay chim): This is a mistranslation or misunderstanding of the text. There's no mention of using cultural differences as an ""escape plan"" or anything to do with ""paying chim"". It's about understanding potential cultural differences in behavior and assertively setting boundaries."
"Kedu ọnọdụ, dị ka akọwara na paragraf ahụ, nwere ike ime ka onye na-ese foto anụ ọhịa rụọ ọrụ nke oghere pụrụ iche?","The correct answer is **A: Ọ bụrụ na ha na-ese foto nke karịsịa obere anụmanụ.**

The paragraph states: ""Foto anụ ọhịa na-achọ ogologo oghere telephoto, n’agbanyeghi ihe dika igwe nnụnụ maọbụ obere okike choro oghere ndi ozo."" This translates to: ""Wildlife photography often requires long telephoto lenses, although things like bird photography or small creatures require other lenses."" This indicates that photographing small animals requires specialized lenses *other than* telephoto lenses.
"
Kedu nke n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị ihe ịma aka nwere ike ime maka ndị na-ese foto anụ ọhịa kwuru na akụkụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **B: ejizi ihe ike e kere eke**

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions the following as challenges:

    *   Finding specific animals: ""*Ọtụtụ mgbe, ọ na-ara ahụ ịchọta ụmụ anụmanụ ọpụrụiche*"" (Finding specific animals is often difficult.)
    *   Need for specific equipment: ""*Foto anụ ọhịa na-achọ ogologo oghere telephoto, n’agbanyeghi ihe dika igwe nnụnụ maọbụ obere okike choro oghere ndi ozo.*"" (Wildlife photography requires long telephoto lenses, although things like birds or small creatures require different lenses.)
    *   Working in challenging conditions: ""*Gburugburu ya nwere ike dị oyi, ọkụ, maọbụ dị njọ.*"" (The environment can be cold, hot, or dangerous.)
*   The passage doesn't specifically mention ""Dealing with the violence of nature"" as a specific difficulty. Although it implies wildlife can be dangerous, the passage emphasizes the environment or the animals themselves as being a struggle rather than the inherent ""violence of nature"" itself."
Kedu nke nwere ike ịkpata onye ọkwọ ụgbọ ala nwere ugwu gafere nsogbu kacha nta?,"The passage states the following can cause problems for drivers in high latitude or mountainous regions:

*   Snow, ice, or freezing conditions on roads leading to low traction.
*   Snow accumulation potentially leading to being stuck.
*   Visibility obstruction due to falling/blowing snow or ice/frost on windshield.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Okporo ụzọ ndị njem na-akpụ akpụ na ya (Roads traveled by tourist):** This is not directly mentioned in the passage as a factor that would affect driving ability in mountainous terrain.
*   **B: obere nguzogide (Low traction):** The passage explicitly mentions that snow and ice on the road lead to low traction, which is a significant problem.
*   **C: Oke ụmụ irighiri mmiri (Heavy frost):** The passage mentions frost on the windshield, which obstructs visibility, posing a problem for drivers.
*   **D: Mgbochi mgbaraihe (Visibility obstruction):** The passage mentions that visibility can be affected by falling snow or ice/frost on the windshield.

Between options B, C, and D, low traction would be the most dangerous situation for a driver in mountainous terrain since it greatly affects the driver's control of the vehicle. Of the options given, the least likely problem to be encountered in mountainous terrain would be one relating to tourists on the road.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Okporo ụzọ ndị njem na-akpụ akpụ na ya (Roads traveled by tourist).**"
Kedu akụkụ nke ụtụ isi ego nwere ike ịbụ otu na mba niile?,"Based on the prompt, the correct answer is **A: Ụgwọ** (Wage).

Here's why:

*   The passage explains that tax systems and tax rates vary from country to country. However, the prompt implies we should think of aspects that may be uniform across tax systems.
*   Ụgwọ (Wage) is the base amount of money someone earns, and is essential for tax purposes. The amount someone earns determines which tax bracket they fall into.
*   The other options (Nkata, Nrụpụta ihe owuwu, and nke ị na-etinye) will depend on the specific tax rules and economic conditions of each country."
Nkeji edemede ahụ na-ekwu na ị ga-etinye akwụkwọ ụtụ isi ego gị ebe ị dabere ma ọ bụrụ na ị na-arụ ọrụ ná mba ọzọ?,"The correct answer is **A: ebe ọ bụla ị na-ebikarị**.

The passage states that you pay taxes in your ""obodo ibi,"" which translates to ""country of residence"" or ""where you live."" Therefore, the most accurate answer is ""wherever you reside.""
"
Kedu n'ime nkọwa ndị a maka ngosi ngosi ụwa nke na-abụghị eziokwu?,"The correct answer is **D: Ntinye aka adịghị mkpa site na mba niile.**

Here's why:

*   **A: Ngosipụta nwere ike igosi akụkọ ma ọ bụ omenala obodo** - This is TRUE. The passage states participating countries show ""cultural or historical achievements.""
*   **B: N'akụkụ ngosi nka na ihe ọmụma, ihe ngosi botanical na-egosipụta** - This is TRUE. The passage says that apart from art and educational exhibitions, ""International Horticultural Expositions are special events where flowers, gardens and other plant-related elements are displayed.""
*   **C: Ihe nwere ike ịga n'ihu ruo ọnwa isii** - This is TRUE. The passage says ""lasting anywhere between three and six months"".
*   **D: Ntinye aka adịghị mkpa site na mba niile** - This is FALSE. The first sentence of the passage stated the ""World Expos (variously called International Expositions, or World's Fairs) are large international exhibitions organized by countries"". This statement implies that it's organised *by* countries, which then implies that it's organised *with* countries. It may not be *all* countries (the language may have been misleading in English), but it is not the most incorrect answer from the provided options."
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a chọrọ maka ngosi ngosi mba ụwa ma ọ bụ ngosi ngosi ụwa?,"The correct answer is **B: Enweghị ike ịme mmemme ahụ kwa afọ n'otu mba ahụ**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Agbanyeghị n’ime tiori ha nwere ike imeli kwa afọ (ọ bụrụhaala na ha nọ na mba dị iche iche), na omume ha anọghị ya."" This directly implies that the event cannot be held annually in the same country.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: A ghaghị iwepụta akụkọ ihe mere eme nke mba, yana ihe ịma aka zuru ụwa ọnụ ugbu a:** While the passage mentions countries showcase their culture and history, it doesn't say it *must* present these aspects. It only mentions it as a potential way to exhibit the achievements of the country.
*   **C: Ihe omume nwere ike ịdịru karịa ọnwa isii:** The passage states that the event typically lasts between three to six months.
*   **D: Mba niile ga-esonyerịrị maka ngosi a ga-anabata ya:** The passage says that participating countries showcase their culture and achievements, but it does not state that all nations must participate."
Kedu n'ime omume ndị a ga-eme ka mwakpo anụmanụ ghara ịdị obere?,"The correct answer is **B: Na-ebupụ ihe mkpofu n'ogige**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that smells and food attract bears and other wildlife. Removing garbage from the campsite reduces these attractants, making an attack less likely.
*   The passage stated to keep bears and wolves at least 100 yards away, therefore, option C is false.
*   Options A and D are not mentioned in the passage and are not likely to deter an animal attack."
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-ekwughị na paragraf dị ka ihe nwere ike ime ka ụmụ anụmanụ na-awakpo ụmụ mmadụ?,"The correct answer is **D: anụmanụ ndị na-amabughị ndị mmadụ nso**.

Here's why:

*   **A: ike isi:** The paragraph explicitly states, ""mara amara na usi na adọta ụmụ bea na anụ ọhịa ndị ọzọ, ya mere zere ibu ma ọ bụ isi ụmụ nri na-esi usi ma debe kampụ dị ọcha""

*   **B: Ọdịda idobe anya dị mma:** The paragraph explicitly states ""Afọ ọ bụla, a na-emerụ ọtụtụ ndị nleta ahụ n'ihi na ha enyeghị ezigbo ohere""

*   **C: na-enye anụ ọhịa nri:** The paragraph explicitly states ""anụ ọhịa bụ nke azụghịazụ ma e kwesịghị inye ha nri ma ọ bụ nye ha nsogbu.""

*   **D: anụmanụ ndị na-amabughị ndị mmadụ nso:** The paragraph does mentions that ""Agbanyeghị na ọ maala ahụ ọtụtụ n'ime ụmụ anụmanụ nọ n'obianụmanụ ịhụ ndị mmadụ"" but this is in regards to the wild animals being untamed, so there isn't any relevance between this and the animal attacking humans.

Therefore, the option that isn't mentioned as a cause of animal attacks is animals being unfamiliar with humans."
