ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ነቲ ኣኮርዲዮን ብዕዉት መገዲ ንኽትጻወት ዘኽእለካ ቕኑዕ ምኽሪ ጌርካ ዘይርአ እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ተወሳኺ መጠን ድምጺ እንተ ደሊኻ፡ ነቶም መፋትሕ እትወቕዓሉ ሓይሊ ወስኽ**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states ""**ከም ፒያኖ ዝኣመሰለ ተወሳኺ መጠን ድምጺ ንምርካብ ነቲ መፍትሕ ብሓይሊ ኽትወቕዖ ኸም ዘየድልየካ ኣይትረስዕ።**"" (Don't forget that you don't have to hit the keys hard to get extra volume, like on a piano). Option A directly contradicts this statement.
*   The passage mentions about saving energy and using pressure / speed.
Therefore the correct answer is A."
ኣኮርዲዮን ክትጻወት ከለኻ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣየኖት እዮም ነቲ ድምጺ ኸተዛይዶ ዝሕግዙኻ?,"The correct answer is **A: ዝያዳ ናህሪ**.

The passage states, ""ኣብ ኣኮርዲዮን ዝያዳ መጠን ድምጺ ምእንቲ ኺህልወካ ዝያዳ ጸቕጢ **ወይ ፍጥነት** ኢኻ እትጥቀም።"" which translates to ""On the accordion you use more pressure **or speed** in order to have a greater volume.""
"
እቶም ኣብ ተለቪዥን ዝርኣዩ ስእልታት ስለምንታይ እዩ ወሰን ወሰኖም ዝቝረጽ?,"The correct answer is **B: እቲ ስእሊ ነቲ እስክሪን ብምሉኡ ስለዝመልኦ (እቲ ስእሊ ነቲ እስክሪን ብምሉኡ ስለዝመልኦ)**.

The passage explicitly states the reason for overscan:  ""እዚ ኸኣ እቲ ምስሊ ንብምሉኡ እቲ ኤለክትሮኒካዊ መሳርሒ ኸም ዚሽፍን ንምግባር እዩ ዚግበር (እዚ ኸኣ እቲ ምስሊ ንብምሉኡ እቲ ኤለክትሮኒካዊ መሳርሒ ኸም ዚሽፍን ንምግባር እዩ ዚግበር)."". This translates to ""This is done to make the image fill the entire electronic device"".

ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ሓደ ሰብ ንፊልም ናብ ዲቪዲ ኪቕይሮ እንከሎ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ጸገማት ኣየናይ እዩ ከጋጥሞ ዝኽእል?,"The correct answer is **B: ምቑራጽ ገለ ክፋላት ንኡስ ኣርእስቲታት (Cutting off parts of the subtitles)**

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states that when creating a DVD, the borders can be cut off, and ""if the video has subtitles at the bottom, they may not be fully visible.""
"
ናይ ብሪጣንያ መዓስከር ሰራዊት ኣበይ እዩ ነይሩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ትሬንተን (Trenton)**.

The passage mentions the main attack force would cross the river 9 miles north of Trenton and then split into two columns to attack at dawn. This indicates the British camp was in Trenton, the target of the attack.
"
ኣብቲ ብኢድ እተጻሕፈ ንድፊ ናይ መን ፌርማ እዩ ተረኺቡ?,"The correct answer is **D: ቻርለስ ቶምሰን** (Charles Thomson).

The passage states that the handwritten copy was signed by John Hancock (President of Congress) and Charles Thomson (Secretary).
"
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ቦታታት፡ እቲ ዱንላፕ ቦርድሳይድ መወዳእታ ኣበይ በጺሑ ነይሩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ለንደን** (London).

The passage states ""ቅዳሕ ነሓሰ 10 ለንደን በጽሐ"" which translates to ""A copy reached London on August 10"". Although there are different places mentioned in the paragraph where the document reached, London is the last one mentioned chronologically.
"
ወተሃደራት ኮነሬል ስታርክ ኣበይ ቦታ ሒዞም ነይሮም?,"The correct answer is **A: ብሸነኽ ሰሜን፡ ጥቓ እቲ ሓጹር (By the North, close to the hedge)**.

The passage states ""ናይ ስታርክ ወታደራት አብ ሰሜናዊ መወዳእታ ናይቲ ባዕዳዊ ዘሎ ቦታ በቲ ሓፁር ቦታ ሒዞም ይርከቡ (Stark's soldiers were at the northern end of the alien territory, holding the area by the hedge)."" This clearly indicates they were located in the northern part, near the hedge.
"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ወተሃደራት ስታርክ ሓጹሮም ዘስፋሕፍሕዎ መዓስ እዩ ነይሩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ኣብ እዋን ትሑት ማዕበል (ኣብ እዋን ንኡስ ማዕበል)**.

The text states: ""እቲ ንኡስ ማዕበል ብሚስቲክ ሩባ አቢሉ አብ ሰሜን ምብራQ ፔኒንሱዌላ ክፍተት ምስ ፈጠረ ብፍጥነት ነዚ ሓፁር ብሓፂር ናይ እምኒ መንደቅ ንሰሜን ገፅ እስካብ አብታ ፀግዒ ማይ ነሽተይ ገምገም አናዊሖሞ.""  This translates to ""When the low tide created a gap in the northeast peninsula via the Mystic River, they quickly extended the fence with a short stone wall northward to the small sandy beach in the cove.""

ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ሓደ ኻብቲ ኣብ ቻይና ዝነበረ ዓመጽ ዝመልኦ መዋእል ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **D: መዋእል ሰለስተ ምድረ-ነገስታት (Mawa’il Seleste Midre-Negestat)**.

The text explicitly states that the Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history: ""እተን ሰለስተ መንግስትታት ሓደ ኻብቲ ኣብ ታሪኽ ጥንታዊቻይና ኻብ እተፈጸመ ኣዝዩ ደም ዝመልኦ መዋእል እየን ነይረን (ʾeten seleste mengistatat ḥade kafeti ʾābi tarikhi t’int’awīchayina kafi ʾeteffeṣeme ʾāziyu demi zimelʾo mawaʾili yeyiren neyiren).""
"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ብዛዕባ ናብ ሰበኽ ሳግም ደረጃ ዝኣትዉ ሰራዊት ጻጸ ሓቂ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ኣብ እዋን ለይቲ ይሰፍሩ (ኣብ እዋን ለይቲ ይሰፍሩ)**.

The text states ""ኣብ ብርኪ ሰበኸ ሳግም ሰራዊት አብ እዋን ላይቲ ይዋፈሩ ቐትሪ ድማ ናብ ማዓሰከር ይምለሱ (In the sebekh sagim stage, the army operates at night and returns to camp during the day)."" This directly supports option A.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: ውሑድ ቀረብ መግቢ ኣለዎም (They have a limited supply of food):** While food shortage triggers the migratory stage, it's not specifically mentioned as a characteristic of the *sebekh sagim* stage.
*   **C: ድሕሪ 17 መዓልታት ዝቕየሩ ሰፈራት ይሰርሑ (They build camps that change after 17 days):** This refers to the migratory (ሱጉምታዊ) stage, not the sebekh sagim stage.
*   **D: ኣብ እዋን ቀትሪ ይጓዓዙ (They travel during the day):** The opposite is true; they return to camp during the day.
"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ኣየናይ መግለጺ እዩ ነቲ ሰፈር ሰራዊት ጻጸ ኣብ እዋን ሰበኽ ሳግም ደረጃ ዝነበሮ ልምዲ ብልክዕ ዘንጸባርቕ?,"The correct answer is **A: ኣብ እዋን ለይቲ ሰፈራት ይሃንጹ (In the night they build settlements)**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""አብ ብርኪ ሰበኸ ሳግም ሰራዊት አብ እዋን ላይቲ ይዋፈሩ ቐትሪ ድማ ናብ ማዓሰከር ይምለሱ."" This translates to: ""During the *sebek sagim* stage, the army camps during the night and returns to camp during the day."" Therefore, the ጻጸ ሰራዊት build camps during the night.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ከይሰፈሩ ን17 መዓልታት ይጓዓዙ (They travel for 17 days without settling)** This describes the *sugumtawi* phase, not the *sebek sagim* phase.
*   **C: መዓልታዊ ሰፈራቶም ይቕይሩ (They change their settlements daily)** This also describes the *sugumtawi* phase, not the *sebek sagim* phase.
*   **D: ኣብ ጻንሒት እቲ ደረጃ ሓደ ዓይነት ሰፈራት እዮም ዝጥቀሙ (They use the same type of settlements during the duration of the stage)** This is incorrect because in the *sebek sagim* phase they go to the camp during the day and settle in the night.
"
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ግዳማዊ ምልክታትት እናሃለወ ኽነሱ ዝቕጽል ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ስነ-ሂወታዊ ሰዓታት (ስነ-ህይወታዊ ሰዓታት / Biological clocks)**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ሰዓታት ስነ-ህይወታውያን ርእሶም ዝኸኣሉ ተወዛወዝቲ ኮይኖም... ብነጻ ዝዘውር ዑደቶም ክቕጽሉ ይኽእሉ እዮም"" (Biological clocks are independent oscillators... they can continue their independent cycles even without any external guidance).

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: ብውሕሉል መንገዲ ዝግበሩ ውሽጣዊ ዑደታት (Well-regulated internal cycles):** While related to biological clocks, this is a general term and doesn't capture the specific self-sustaining nature described in the passage.
* **B: በብእዋኑ ዝግበር ህርመታት (Periodic rhythms):**  These rhythms are a *result* of biological clocks, but they aren't the clocks themselves.
* **D: ዝተዓዘበ ህርመታት (Observed rhythms):**  These are just the *manifestations* of the underlying biological clocks.

Therefore, only biological clocks themselves, as stated in the passage, can continue independently even in the absence of external cues.
"
እተፈላለየ ክሱት ባህርያት ዘንጸባርቑ ውልቀ-ሰባት እትገልጽ ቃል አየነይቲ እያ?,"The correct answer is **D: ፖሊይሞርፊክ**.

The text states that individuals within a population that show a lot of variation in a specific trait are known as polymorphic.
"
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ነቶም ፍሉይ ቦታ ዝሕዙ ተህዋስያን እትገልጽ ትኽክለኛ ቃል ኣየነይቲ እያ?,"The correct answer is **B: ህዝቢ**

Here's why:

*   The passage defines **ህዝቢ** (population) as a group of the same species living in a specific geographic area.
*   The question asks which term describes organisms occupying a specific location. This is exactly the definition of a population.
*   The other options are incorrect:
    *   **ሞኖሞርፊክ** describes a population where individuals have similar traits.
    *   **ጅር** (Gene) the basic unit of heredity.
    *   **ፖሊይሞርፊክ** describes a population where individuals have a variety of traits for a specific characteristic.

Therefore, **B** is the only option that directly addresses the concept of organisms and their location."
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣብነታት ተፈጥሮ-መሰረት ዝገበረ ንጥፈት ቱሪዝም ዘይኮነ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ናብ ቤተ- መዘክር ስነ-ፍልጠት ምብጻሕ (Visiting a science museum)**.

Here's why:

*   **Nature-based tourism** focuses on activities that occur in natural settings and involve direct interaction with nature.
*   **A:** Hiking through canyons is a nature-based activity.
*   **B:** Photographing wildflowers is a nature-based activity.
*   **D:** Fly fishing is a nature-based activity.
*   **C:** Visiting a science museum, while it may relate to nature, is an indoor activity and doesn't involve direct interaction with a natural environment."
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ስርዓት መጓዓዝያ መሰረታዊ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"Based on the text, the fundamental transportation system described is **B: ናይ ውልቀ መካይን (Private Cars)**.

The passage explicitly states that people use their ""ናይ ውልቐ መኪና"" (private cars) despite the opportunity to interact and support each other within their villages. The problem the text presents is that this reliance on private cars contributes to a ""ካርቦኒክ ቍጠባ"" (carbon economy) that destabilizes the biosphere.

እቲ ኑክልየስ ብኣየኖት ዓይነት ንጥረ ነገራት ዝቖመ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ፕሮቶንን ኒውትሮንን**.

The passage states: ""ኒዩክለስ ክልተ ነገራት ዘዋሃደ እዩ -ኒዩትሮናትን ፕሮቶናትን."" (The nucleus is composed of two things - neutrons and protons).

Here's why:

*   The prompt (P) explains that binary numbers are made up of 0s and 1s, and that these individual digits are called ""bits"".
*   The question (Q) asks for an example of a five-bit binary number.
*   Option C, 10010, is the only one with five digits, all of which are either 0 or 1.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   A: 1010 - This has only four digits (four bits).
*   B: 12001 - This includes digits other than 0 and 1, so it's not a binary number.
*   D: 110101 - This has six digits (six bits)."
ክልተኣዊ-ኣሃዝ እንታይ ተባሂሎም እውን ይጽውዑ?,"The correct answer is **A: ቢትስ** (Bits).

The passage states ""...ኣዞም ቁጽርታት ክልተኣዊ ኣሃዛት ወይ ቢታት እንትበሃሉ..."" which translates to ""...these numbers are called binary digits or bits...""

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣብቲ ጽሑፍ ከም ቀዳሞት ረብሓታት ናይ ተምሃሮ ጽሑፋት ዘይተገለጹ ኣየኖት እዮም?,"The correct answer is **B: ካብ መዛኑ ዝመጽእ ነቐፌታ ምንካይ (Reducing criticism from peers)**.

Here's why:

*   **A: ምምሕያሽ ሰዋስውን ናይ ምጽሓፍ ክእለትን (Improving grammar and writing skills):** The passage explicitly states that blogs can help improve students' writing skills and grammar.

*   **C: ናይ ከባቢኻ ኣፍልጦ ምስፋሕ (Expanding knowledge of your surroundings):** The passage mentions, ""ምግዳድ ንተምሃሮ አብ ከባቢኦም ብዛዕባ ዘሎ ዓለም ንከድሕኑ (Forcing students to explore the world around them)"".

*   **D: ምውሳኽ ብቐጻልነት ናይ ምምሃር ድልየት (Increasing the desire to learn continuously):** The passage states that blogging encourages collaboration and motivates students to learn beyond the traditional classroom setting, implying a continued desire to learn.

*   **B: ካብ መዛኑ ዝመጽእ ነቐፌታ ምንካይ (Reducing criticism from peers):** While the passage does mention that student bloggers start trying to improve their writing to avoid criticism, it doesn't specify that this criticism comes directly from peers. Instead, it focuses on the blogger becoming more responsive to feedback from audience and wanting to improve their writing to connect with this readership.

Therefore, reducing criticism from peers is **NOT** explicitly mentioned in the passage as a primary benefit of student writing.

*   **B: ነቐፌታ ክውገድ ዝግበር ድፍኢት (Nek'efeta kiwgede zigiber difi'iti)** - The passage states that students are motivated to improve their writing to avoid criticism from their audience.
*   **C: ናይ ተዓዘብቶም ድልየት ምሕላው (Nayi te'azebitom diliyeti mihilawi)** - The passage also emphasizes the importance of appealing to the audience's desires, which motivates students to be more active and proficient."
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ጥቕሚታት ዘይሰማማዕ ዝርርብ ንተምሃሮ ዘይኮኑ ኣየኖት እዮም? ,"The correct answer is **B: ኣብ ዝኾነ እዋን ናይ መዓልቲ ምስ መምሃራን ገጽ-ንገጽ ናይ ምርኻብ ዕድል (At any time of the day, the opportunity to meet with teachers face-to-face)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes asynchronous (ዘይሰማማዕ) communication**, which means communication that doesn't happen in real-time. This includes things like email, forum posts, or pre-recorded lectures.
* **Option B** describes synchronous (ሰማማዕ) communication, specifically *face-to-face* meetings with teachers, which contradicts the asynchronous nature described in the passage.  The passage says students can contact teachers at any time, but that doesn't mean they'll get an immediate, face-to-face response.

The other options *do* align with the benefits of asynchronous learning:

* **A: ንኢንተርኔት ከም ምንጪ ምጥቃም (Using the internet as a source)**: Asynchronous learning often relies heavily on online resources.
* **C: ተዓጻጻፊ ናይ ስራሕ ሰዓታት (Flexible working hours)**: Asynchronous learning allows students to learn at their own pace and schedule.
* **D: ምቁጽጻር ፍጥነት (Controlling the pace)**: Asynchronous learning allows students to control the speed at which they learn.

Here's why:

* **The passage argues that asynchronous communication *reduces* time constraints.** The text explicitly states that flexible work hours are possible because of asynchronous communication.
* **The other options are supported by the passage:**
    * **A: ፍጥነት ትምህርቲ (ፍጥነት)**: The passage says asynchronous learning allows students to work at their own pace and control the pace of the material.
    * **C: መምሃሪ ንዋት (መምሃሪ ሓበሬታታት)**: The passage suggests students can access materials at any time.
    * **D: ኢንተርኔት ምጥቃም (ተጠቃምነት ኢንተርነትን ዓለምለኸዊ መርበብ መራኸቢን)**: The passage focuses on the benefits of internet and WWW access for information.

Therefore, option B is the one that disagrees with the idea that asynchronous communication provides flexibility for students.

Here's why:

*   **A: ጎዳጉዲ በዓቲ (Dungeon)**: The text mentions ""ነቲ ኻብ ጕድጓድ ቤት ኤል ዚወጽእ ፍርሂ ኸተጨንቖ ትኽእል ኢኻ"" which translates to ""you can almost squeeze the fear that comes from the dungeon"". So, dungeons are mentioned.
*   **B: ተዋጋእቲ ሰብ ፈረስ (Mounted warriors)**: The text mentions ""ውድድር ኣርተርን (Arthurian tournaments)"". These tournaments involved mounted knights.
*   **D: ፈረሰኛ (Knights)**: As mentioned above, knights were heavily involved in Arthurian tournaments.
*   **C: ዳጌት (Dagger)**: Daggers are not explicitly mentioned in the text."

The passage mentions remembering the following from the castle ruins:

*   ድሃይን ሽታን ውግኣት (sounds and smells of battles)
*   ሸዀናኡ ኣብቲ ኮቦርታ ኺስማዕ ከሎ (the sound of horses' hooves on the cobblestones)
*   ነቲ ኻብ ጕድጓድ ቤት ኤል ዚወጽእ ፍርሂ ኸተጨንቖ (the fear emanating from the dungeon)

ድግሳት (feasts/celebrations) are mentioned as a subject of art within the cultural memory of the castle, but not as a sensory experience one can imagine from the ruins themselves."

Here's why:

*   The passage states that in the 1480s, when Lord Hastings started building the castle, the country was relatively peaceful, and only needed protection from small groups of raiders. This directly supports option B.
*  Option A is wrong because it was Lord Hastings not the King. Option C is incorrect and option D is wrong, according to the passage."

The passage specifically mentions ""ቀጢን መናድቕ"" (thin walls) as a characteristic of Kirby Muxloe Castle. While large windows (ዓበይቲ መሳኹቲ) are also mentioned, the core issue is the thinness of the walls and their inability to withstand attack.

The text states: ""ሓድ-ሓደ ኣብ ሓጋይ እዋን ሃገር አቋራጺ ምጉያይ ን ጂም ናይ ኣካል ዝለዓለ ክፋል ስራሕ ብሓንሳብ ንጉያ እዋን ብሉጽ ምድላው እዩ."" This translates to: ""Sometimes in the summer, cross-country running is the best preparation for the running season, combining gym work for the upper body.""

Therefore, according to the text, cross-country running in the summer is the most beneficial preparation for the upcoming running season.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""ኣብ ክልተ ደቒቓ ክውድእ ዝኽእል እኹል ፍጥነት ክህልዎ ኣልዎ"" which translates to ""They must have enough speed to finish in two minutes.""  This directly emphasizes the importance of speed for a half-miler.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

* **A: ኣብ እዋን ወርሓት ሓጋይ ጉያ ስግረ ዶብ ምልምማድ (Cross-country training during summer months):** While the text mentions this as beneficial for conditioning, it's presented as *one* method of preparation, not the *most* important aspect.

* **B: ካብ ናህሪ ተጻዋርነት ምዂስኳስ (Developing endurance from speed):** The text mentions both speed and endurance as important, but it *specifically emphasizes* the need for speed to finish under two minutes.

* **D: ካብ ተጻዋርነት ናህሪ ምዂስኳስ (Developing speed from endurance):**  Similar to option B, it focuses on the *relationship* between speed and endurance but doesn't highlight the absolute necessity of running under two minutes as the primary requirement.

Therefore, **C** is the most direct and accurate answer based on the information provided in the text.

ንሓደ ኣትሌት፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ብኣመጋግባ ጥራይ ክብጻሕ ዘይከኣል ኣየናይ ኢዩ?,"The passage states that good nutritional habits *do* lead to improved performance (A and C) and overall health (D). It also implies that understanding good habits can increase an athlete's love for the sport, which is connected to more happiness (B).

The passage emphasizes that good nutrition is crucial for *all* of the mentioned benefits.  The question asks which one *cannot* be achieved through nutrition alone.

Therefore, the best answer is **B: ዝያዳ ሓጎስ (More happiness)**.

While good nutrition can contribute to happiness by improving performance and health, happiness is also strongly influenced by other factors like mental well-being, social connections, and enjoyment of the sport itself. Nutrition is a *contributing* factor, but not the *sole* determinant of happiness.

*   **A: ግቡእ ኣመጋግባ ምልምማድ (Proper nutrition practices):** The passage explicitly mentions the importance of good nutrition.

*   **B: ብቐጻልነት ብዝለዓለ ደረጃ ምስራሕ (Consistently working at a high level):** The passage does *not* directly mention consistently working at a high level as a factor to increase joy.

*   **C: ብትኽክል ማይ ምስታይ (Drinking water correctly):** The passage mentions proper hydration practices.

*   **D: ጥዑይ ሓይሊ ሚዛን ምዕቃብ (Maintaining a healthy energy balance):** The passage mentions healthy energy balance as a positive habit.

Therefore, the answer is **B**.

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""...ኮይኑ ቈጸረ ዘድልዩ ውሑድ መሳርሒታት ብዛዕባ ብዙሕ ዝተጋገዩ ኣመለካክታ ኣለዉ (there are many misconceptions about the few pieces of equipment needed, which are relatively inexpensive)."" This directly supports the idea that runners might buy expensive equipment due to a misunderstanding of what's truly necessary.
* **A (ውልቃዊ ምርጭኦም እዩ - It's their personal preference):** While personal preference plays a role, the passage emphasizes *misconceptions*.
* **B (ዝተረጋገጹ ረብሓታት ኣለዎ - It has proven benefits):** The passage explicitly states that most products have little or no impact on performance.
* **C (ንብቕዓቶም ብዓብይኡ ክጸልዎ እዩ - It will greatly affect their performance):** This contradicts the passage's statement that most products have little impact.

Therefore, option D aligns best with the core message of the passage: runners buy expensive equipment because they're misled about the necessity and benefits of it.

The passage explicitly states that understanding the *ዕላማ (purpose/intention)* of others is an important skill that helps us understand unclear physical events. The example of breaking the car window clearly illustrates how the interpretation of the act changes depending on the perceived *ዕላማ (purpose/intention)*: stealing vs. gaining entry to one's own car."

The text explicitly states that understanding the intentions of others helps us understand unclear physical events. The example given demonstrates this: seeing someone break a car window leads to different interpretations (theft vs. lost keys) depending on the perceived intention. This process of interpreting ambiguous actions is precisely what choice A describes.

Let's analyze why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **B: ድልየታት ይግምቱ (Guess desires)**: While related to understanding intentions, the text focuses on clarifying *actions* rather than directly guessing desires.
*   **C: ንኻልኦት ሰባት ብዘይ ፍርዲ ይርእዩ (Look at other people without judgment)**: While understanding context *can* lead to less judgment, it is not the primary function described in the text. The text emphasizes how understanding intentions clarify physical actions.
*   **D: ናይ ካልኦት ሰባት ኣእምሮ የንብቡ (Read other people's minds)**: The text states that humans have an unmatched ability to read the minds of others, not that they can read the minds of others. The example in the text shows an understanding of the actions of other people.

This directly relates to automating tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence.

While options A, B, and C (መደብ ምውጻእ - Planning, ድምጺ ምልላይ - Voice Recognition, ግዜ ምምዳብ - Time Management) are *examples* of AI capabilities, they are not the overarching *goal*. The broader aim is to automate processes using intelligent systems.

The text mentions ""መደብን ውጥንን (planning and scheduling)"" and ""ምልላይ ጽሕፈት ኢድ (handwriting recognition)"" as examples of AI applications.

While ""ኣገልግሎት ዓሚል (customer service)"" is also mentioned (""ናይ ዓመዊል ጸገማትን ሕቶታትን ናይ ምምላስ ክእለት - ability to answer customer problems and questions""), planning and scheduling and handwriting recognition are more directly related to the core functions the passage associates with AI.

Looking away while talking (A) and fidgeting with your fingers (D) are behaviors, but not necessarily micro-*facial*-expressions. However, furrowing your brow (B) is a facial expression, and gulping quickly (C) can be related to a change in facial expression, thus both could possibly indicate micro-expression.

The best answer is **D: በኣጻብዕትኻ ጽቡቕ ምባል (fidgeting with your fingers)** because it is least associated with *facial* micro-expressions.
"
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ብዛዕባ ትርጉም ንእሽቶ ኣገላልጻ ትኽክል ዘይኮነ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ዘረባን ኣብ ገጽ ዚንበብ መግለጺታትን ይትርጐም (Speech and facial expressions are translated)**

Here's why:

*   The passage focuses on interpreting *micro-expressions* (minute facial expressions), not on translating speech in general. While it mentions people with brain damage who can't understand speech, the main point is their ability to gauge sincerity from these subtle facial cues.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: እተቐድሐ ቪድዮታት ዓብዪ ምምሕያሽ ኣምጺኡ እዩ (Recorded videos have brought great improvement)** - The passage states that video recording has opened up important avenues for discoveries related to micro-expressions.
*   **B: ቅኑዕ ትርጉም ሓሶት ከለሊይ ይኽእል እዩ (Correct interpretation can detect lies)** - The passage states that it is believed micro-expressions can be interpreted to tell if someone is lying.
*   **D: ቅንዕና ንምግምጋም ኪሕግዝ ይኽእል (It can help to assess sincerity)** - The passage mentions that people with brain damage, despite not understanding speech, can accurately assess sincerity, implying that micro-expressions contribute to this ability.

So, option C is the only one that misrepresents the content of the passage."
ብውጽኢት ተሃድሶ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣየናይ እዩ ዝያዳ ኣገዳሲ ዝኾነ? ,"The passage focuses on how the *increased* access to and learning of information (which it calls ""knowledge acquisition and learning capacity"" being ""heightened"") has *changed* the way information is found.  The text says the ""rate at which knowledge is acquired has changed,"" the method to find information is different, and the Renaissance has brought about significant change in learning, presentation, and the *spread of knowledge*.

Looking at the options:

*   **A: ናይ ውልቀ-ሰብ ተዘክሮ (Individual memory):** While memory is related to learning, the passage emphasizes the change in how knowledge is *acquired and disseminated*, not solely on individual memory.
*   **B: ፍልጠት ምዝውዋር (Knowledge Transfer):** This is a strong contender. The passage directly speaks about the ""spread of knowledge"" being impacted by the Renaissance. This closely aligns with the idea of knowledge transfer.
*   **C: ናይ ጽሑፍ ተዘክሮ (Text memory):** This is too specific. While text is a medium, the passage isn't primarily about the memory of text.
*   **D: ሓበሬታ ምርካብ (Information retrieval):** This is another strong contender. The passage explicitly states ""the method required to find information was different."" The entire passage emphasizes how access to information and the way it's sought out has shifted.

**Reasoning:**

Both ""Knowledge Transfer"" (B) and ""Information Retrieval"" (D) are good answers. However, the passage first mentions that access to and learning of information has increased, therefore impacting the way knowledge is spread, before mentioning changes in how information is found. Thus, the main focus is how knowledge is broadly disseminated.

**Therefore, the best answer is B: ፍልጠት ምዝውዋር (Knowledge Transfer).**

ብውጽኢት ተሃድሶ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣብ ኣየናይ እዩ ዝነኣሰ ትዂረት ተገይሩ?,"The passage focuses on the *increased* ability to acquire and learn knowledge and the changes in *how* knowledge is accessed and disseminated. It mentions the pressure on individuals and the distracting nature of text messages but highlights the revolution in learning, presentation, and the expansion of knowledge.

Looking at the options:

*   **A: ናይ ውልቀ-ሰብ ተዘክሮ (Individual memory):** The passage doesn't directly discuss a *decreased* emphasis on individual memory. It implies that perhaps it is now less relied upon with the ease of accessing information.

*   **B: ፍልጠት ምርካብ (Knowledge acquisition):** The passage clearly states that the ability to acquire knowledge has increased.

*   **C: ናይ ጽሑፍ ተዘክሮ (Text memory):** This is likely related to individual memory (Option A). There is no clear mention of a decrease in the importance of remembering text.

*   **D: ምዝርጋሕ ሓበሬታ (Information dissemination):** The passage actually highlights that the spread of knowledge has significantly changed due to the revolution, implying MORE focus.

Therefore, the answer is **A: ናይ ውልቀ-ሰብ ተዘክሮ (Individual memory)**. While the passage doesn't explicitly say less focus was placed on it, the implication is that it is likely less important than it used to be, especially because knowledge access has increased.

*   **B: ምስ ስድራ ቤትካ ምርኻብ (Connecting with family):** This directly relates to ""continuous relationships.""

*   **C: ጕዕዞ ምርምር ምግባር (Research Trip):** This can be a source of knowledge to share, so it is related to the text.

*   **D: ምስ ሓደስቲ ሰባት ምልላይ (Meeting new people):** This also falls under the umbrella of connecting with people.

However, the connection to knowledge isn't as direct as other choices. Because ""research trips"" aren't about making connections, the answer is C.

*   **B: ኣብ ናይ ምይይጥ ቦርድ ብኢንተርኔት ምጥቃዕ (Participating in an internet discussion board):** This is a clear example of connecting with people and engaging in discussions, thus promoting personal engagement.

*   **D: ገንዘብ ምቍጽጻር (Managing Finances):** This typically involves more private and individual decision-making. While using the internet for this, the degree of social engagement would be quite low and also can cause the user to make less informed decisions. It's a more solitary pursuit compared to the other options.

Therefore, the option that is *least* likely to be a direct motivator for personal engagement with the internet, based on the passage, is managing finances.

The phrase ""ወተሃደራት ክርስትና ንምእጓድ"" is referring to Christian soldiers, specifically those involved in the Crusades. Thus, the use of clasps for fastening clothing is a result of the Crusades.

*   The passage explicitly states that the British blockade ""ንገለልተኛታት መራኽብ እውን ከይተረፈ ሓደገኛ እዩ ነይሩ"" (was dangerous even for neutral ships). Therefore, option D is the opposite of what the passage says.

Let's examine the other options:

The text states: ""እቲ ስፖርት ብዋናነት ዝፅወት ብ መልክዕ ቃልሲ ኽልተ ሰባት እዩ."" This directly translates to ""The sport is mainly played in the form of a fight between two people.""

ካብቲ ሰውራ ህዝቢ ፈረንሳ ዘበገሶ ለውጥታት ኣብቶም ሸቃሎ ደርባዊ ኣፈላላይ ዓብዪ ጽልዋ ዘሕደረ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: ስነ-ሓሳብ ኣባል ሰልፊ ሪፓብሊክ ተቐባልነት ረኸበ (The idea of membership in a Republic became more accepted)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ሰውራ ፈረንሳ ንብዙሓት ኣብ ካልእ ሃገር ዝርከቡ ጭቈና ዝነበሮም ሸቃሎ ደርቢ እውን ናይ ገዛእ ርእሶም ሰውራ ንኽጅምሩ ደሪኽዎም ኢዩ."" This directly implies that the French Revolution inspired oppressed classes in other countries to start their own revolutions. This inspiration was fueled by the revolutionary ideals of the French Revolution, primarily republicanism (a government without a monarch, where the people hold power). Therefore option C is the correct answer.
The other options are not correct because:

* **A: ነታ ሃገር ዝግበር ደገፍ ወሲኹ(Increased support for the country):** While the Revolution may have initially boosted national pride, the passage focuses on its impact on oppressed classes *outside* of France. The passage doesn't specify anything about increased support for the country only the fact that the revolution started revolutions in other countries too.
* **B: ትኹረት ካብ ደርቢ ናብ ውድድር ተቐይሩ(The focus shifted from class to competition):** The passage is discussing about what influence did the revolution have on the working class. Class struggles are the focus and not competition
* **D: ሓድሽ ኣገባብ መለክዒ (A new system of measurement):** While the metric system *is* mentioned, it's only one aspect of the social and political changes. The primary influence on oppressed classes was the *idea* of revolution and republicanism, not a new measurement system."

The passage states that after the French Revolution, advancement was open to ambitious and successful men, and that soldiers were promoted based on ""Kaylaber"" (which likely refers to their abilities or merit) rather than their social class or rank within the military hierarchy. This indicates that success became dependent on merit or talent rather than lineage or social standing (ደርቢ).

The passage specifically focuses on complaints about transportation systems. While water purification and bridge maintenance are mentioned as *similar* complaints, the primary subject is public transportation.
"

The prompt explicitly states that ""everybody complains about transportation methods"" and goes on to question why these complaints exist. This aligns directly with option C. The other options are not directly supported by the text:

*   **A:** The text states the opposite - people complain about them.
*   **B:** The text uses water purification as an *analogy* to show that complaints are common even in well-developed systems, but doesn't say public transit is *as bad* as impure water.
*   **D:** The text doesn't mention if public transit is free.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that traffic flow analysis is difficult because predicting driver behavior is not 100% reliable.
*   The passage focuses on studying the relationship between flow, density, and speed in traffic flow analysis. If driver behavior is unpredictable, then the flow (which is directly affected by drivers) will also be difficult to predict.

The other options are influenced by traffic flow but not directly. Therefore, because the flow of traffic is difficult to study due to unpredictable drivers, the best answer is D."

Here's why:

*   The text states that flow traffic can be better understood by studying the relationship between three main characteristics: flow, density, and speed. This clearly indicates that density (ጻዕቒ) is a key factor when mathematically modeling traffic flow."

The text states that Hershey and Chase used *phage* to inject their DNA into bacteria. Phage are viruses that infect bacteria. While they used radioactive phosphorus and sulfur as markers in their experiments, and those options are related, the *tool* they used to get the DNA into the bacteria was viruses/phage.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""ብጀርም መስመር ዋህዮታት ውሽጢ ሚውቴሽን ጥራይ ናብ ቆልዑ ክሓልፍይኽእል"" (Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring). Germline cells are involved in sexual reproduction and carry genetic information.
*   **Option B** directly addresses the importance of genetic material, as germline mutations that are passed on to offspring will occur within the DNA. The genetic material that makes up the germline cells is what allows for the mutations to be passed on.
*   **The other options are less relevant:**

    *   **A:** Whether the cells are microorganisms is not the main factor determining heritability.
    *   **C:** The type of mutation is not the main factor determining heritability.
    *   **D:** The possibility of cell death from the mutation is not the main factor determining heritability."

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ሚውቴሽን ከም ሚውቴሽን ዓይነት ዝተፈላለየ ጸልዋ ኣለዎ...ተደላዊ ህዋሳት ናይ ዓሌት-መስመር ህዋሳት እዮም። ብጀርም መስመር ዋህዮታት ውሽጢ ሚውቴሽን ጥራይ ናብ ቆልዑ ክሓልፍይኽእል ፣ ብኻልእ ቦታ ኸኣ ሚውቴሽን ዋህዮ-ሞት ወይ ከኣ ካንሰር የኸትል።"" (Mutations have different effects depending on the type of mutation... and whether the affected cells are germline cells. Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.)

The other options are mentioned in the passage as factors influencing the effects of mutations:

* **A: እቲ ዘርኣዊ መሳርሒ ክንደይ ዝኣክል እዩ ተጎዲኡ** (How much of the genetic material is affected)  is related to ""ኣገዳስነት ስነ-ጂን ንጥረ ነገር"" (importance of the genetic element).
* **C: ኣገዳስነት ናይቶም ዝተጎድኡ ዘርኣዊ መሳርሒታት** (The importance of the affected genetic material) - This is directly mentioned.
* **D: ዓይነት ናይቲ ዝተጸልወ ምልዋጥ** (Type of mutation affected) - The passage says ""ሚውቴሽን ከም ሚውቴሽን ዓይነት ዝተፈላለየ ጸልዋ ኣለዎ"" (mutations have different effects depending on the type of mutation).

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ጥንታዊ ባህልታት ኣጣል ዝሕዘሉ ዝነበረ ምኽንያት ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The passage states: ""ጥንታዊ ባህልታትን ብሄራትን ንዝቀለለ ቀለብ ናይ ጸባ፣ ጸጉሪ፣ ስጋን ቆርበትን ክዕቅብዎም ጀመሩ."" which translates to ""Ancient cultures and peoples began to keep them (goats) for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **A and D: ስጋ ክረኽቡ ስለዝገብሮም (Because they provided meat) and ጸባ ክረኽቡ ስለዝገብሮም (Because they provided milk)**.  Since we need to choose one, we should prioritize the most encompassing answer.

Since both A and D are correct, we can say that they were kept for food. However, the passage mentions both milk and meat. Therefore, the best option is to choose both A and D, or choose the option that mentions both if it were present. Since we have to choose only one of the given options, we should look for the reason that is more important than the other. Therefore, we cannot choose only one answer from the options. The question implies we have to choose one answer, so we can only pick either A or D. However, there is no indication to favour one answer over the other.

Because the passage emphasizes multiple reasons (milk, hair, meat, skin), it's difficult to say one reason is *the* reason. *If* I had to choose only one, based solely on word order and emphasis within the provided text, I'd lean towards:

**A: ስጋ ክረኽቡ ስለዝገብሮም (Because they provided meat)** While milk is important, meat is often considered the more fundamental food source.

**However, the most accurate answer would be A and D if that were an option.**

The passage states: ""ነቲ ሜዳ ብዝወሓደ ስጉምቲ ወይ ምውርዋር ናይ'ቲ በትሪ ዝወድአ ተጻዋቲ እዩ ዝዕወት."" This directly translates to ""The player who finishes the course with the fewest strokes wins."" So, the objective of golf is to take the fewest number of strokes.

The passage states: ""...ብነዃል ኣብ ዙርያ ዘሎ ሕጺር ሰዉሒ ዝለበሰ ቀጠልያ ተባሂሉ ይጽውዕ."" This directly translates to ""around the hole there is short grass called the green.""  Therefore, the grass is short/cut on the green.

The passage explicitly states that experiments are used ""to disprove one or more hypotheses"" (ንሓደ ወይ ልዕሊኡ ግምታዊ ሓሳብ ንምስራዝ). While the other options are also related to science and the scientific method, they are not the *primary* purpose of an experiment as defined in the text.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""ንበይኑ'ኳ ኣይኮነን"" (which translates to ""It is not alone""). This directly indicates that the scientific method *on its own* is insufficient for conducting scientific research. The passage goes on to list other crucial elements such as experimentation and observation.
*   The other options (B, C, and D) are all mentioned in the text as components or activities that *do* contribute to scientific research."

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""ብጣዕሚ ባእሲ ምድላይ ዝኾነ ክልተ ሚእታዊት ህቦብላ ንፋስ ንልዕሊ ሰለስተ ሰዓታት ይጸንሕ።"" (Only two percent of tornadoes last for more than three hours.) This directly contradicts option C.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the text:

* **A: ህቦብላ ንፋስ ንዅሉ እቲ ኣብ ከባቢኦም ዘሎ ከጥፍእዎ ይኽእሉ እዮም (Tornadoes can destroy everything in their path.)** The text says: ""ኣብ መንገዶም ዘለዉ ኩሉ ነገር ከጥፍኡ ይኽእሉ።"" (They can destroy everything in their path.)
* **B: ህቦብላ ንፋስ ካብ ካልእ ህቦብላ ዝነኣሰ ኸባቢታት ይወቅዕ (Tornadoes affect smaller areas than other powerful storms.)** The text says: ""ህቦብላ ንፋስ ምስ ካልኦት ሓያል መብረቅ እንትነጻጸር ዝነኣሰ ኣከባቢ የጥቅዕ"" (Tornadoes affect a smaller area compared to other powerful storms).

Therefore, option C is the only statement that is not a fact according to the text."

*   **A: መብዛሕትኡ ግዜ ንልዕሊ ሰለስተ ሰዓታት ይጸንሑ (Most of the time they last for more than three hours):** The passage states that only *two percent* of tornadoes last for more than three hours. This means the *majority* do *not* last that long. So, this option is incorrect.

*   **B: ዳርጋ 480 ማይልስ ኣብ ሰዓት ዝጓዓዝ ንፋስ ይፈጥሩ (They create winds traveling nearly 480 miles per hour):** The passage says *some* giant tornadoes can have winds up to 300 mph. Since 480 ኪ.ሜ./ሰዓት = 300ማይል/ሰዓት this statement is wrong.

*   **C: ካብ ካልኦት ማዕበላት ንላዕሊ ዓበይቲ ኸባቢታት የጥቅዑ (They affect larger areas than other storms):** The passage states that tornadoes affect a *smaller* area than other severe storms. So, this is incorrect.

*   **D: ኣእዋም ካብ ምድሪ ካብ ሱሮም ክብንቁስዎም ይኽእሉ እዮም (They can uproot trees from the ground):** The passage explicitly states that tornadoes uproot trees.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D**."

* **""ካብ ውሽጢ እቲ በዓቲ እዛ ዓለም እዚኣ ብዙሕ ክትርአ ወይ ክትስማዕ ኣይትኽእልን ኢኻ""**: This highlights the sensory deprivation, suggesting a desire to escape the distractions of the world and find inner peace.

The other options are less supported by the text:

* **B: ኣብ ወጻኢ ዘሎ ጫውጫውታ ንምስትንታን ክሕግዝ ይኽእል ኢዩ**: The text implies the opposite - he went to the cave *to escape* the noise.
* **C: ንበይኑ ኣዝዩ ቁሩብ ግዜ እዩ ዘድልዮ ነይሩ**: The text doesn't specify how much time he spent there. It only says he went there regularly (""የዘውትር ነይሩ"").
* **D: ኪርአን ክስማዕን ከሎ ይቑጣዕ ነይሩ**: The text doesn't mention any anger or frustration.

Therefore, option A best reflects the connection between the cave and Muhammad's spiritual experiences as described in the passage.

Now let's check each option in relation to drawing/pulling the bow (down bow - ታሕቲ ቐስቲ):

*   **A: ዝፈኰሰ ድምጺ (smooth sounding)** - The text says up bows are smooth sounding, so it's *not* associated with the down bow.
*   **B: ጎባጥ ዝመስል ምልክት (rectangle missing its bottom edge)** - The text describes the down bow looking like a rectangle missing the bottom, so it is associated.
*   **C: ዝሓየለ ድምጺ (louder sound)** - The text says down bows are often louder and more forceful, so it is associated.
*   **D: ካብ ቍርዖብ ጀሚርካ (starting from the frog)** - The text says to pull the down bow starting from the frog, so it is associated.

Therefore, the answer is **A: ዝፈኰሰ ድምጺ**
"

So the answer is A: ምልክት ቀስቲ.  (The bow symbol)

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the fossil evidence shows a shift in hand use ""from locomotion to manipulation."" Manipulation means using the hands for tools and other tasks.
*   The other options are related to locomotion or weight-bearing, which the passage indicates hominid hands *stopped* being primarily used for."

The passage states: ""ምዩቴሽን ሓዱሽ ልውውጥ ዘምፀአን ብምረፃ ካብቲ ለውጢ ንክውገድ ይገብር"" which translates to ""Mutation introduces a new change and selection works to remove the change."" The passage also mentions that selection acts on **""ብግልጺ ዝረአን""**, which translates to **""openly visible/expressed""**.
"
ናይ ዘርኢ ለውጢ ኸም ዚህሉ ዚገብር መስርሕ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ምልዋጥ (mutation)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""ምዩቴሽን ሓዱሽ ልውውጥ ዘምፀአን..."" which translates to ""Mutation brings new changes..."" This directly links mutation to the introduction of genetic variation.
*   The other options are mentioned in the passage, but they are not the direct cause of new genetic change. Segregation (ምፍልላይ) and recombination (ዳግመ ምትሕንፋጽ) redistribute existing variation. Manifestation (ተገሊጹ) simply refers to how a genetic trait is expressed."

Here's why:

*   The passage states that animal products (including insects) are easily digestible and provide all the necessary amino acids.
*   It mentions that plant-based protein sources like leaves and wood are difficult to digest, especially if uncooked.
*   While the passage does not specifically name locusts as being the single most important protein source, it says that animal products in general are an easy source of digestible amino acids. Locusts fall into the animal product category, meaning they are a possible means of solving the ""protein problem"".
*   The other options are explicitly mentioned as being difficult to digest or less ideal sources of protein."

Here's why:

*   **The passage mentions the following as consequences of lacking essential amino acids:**
    *   ዝሕተላ ዕብየት (Stunted growth) - This relates to **C: ጭንቀት ዘለዎ ዕቤት (Stunted growth)**
    *   ዓጸቦ (Infertility) - This relates to **B: ጉድለት ኣመጋግባ (Malnutrition)** as infertility is related to bad nutrition
    *   ዘይግዝያዊ ሞት (Eventual death) - This relates to **D: ሞት (Death)**

*   The passage discusses the *difficulty* of digesting certain plant matter *without* cooking, but digestive issues are not the *direct* consequence of amino acid deficiency. Instead, they are related to the type of food consumed.

Therefore, digestive issues (ጉዳያት ምሕቃቕ ምግቢ) are related to the type of food consumed but they are not directly said to be a consequences of amino acid deficiency."

It specifically mentions that children from minority groups who are stereotyped as not performing well in school may underperform after becoming aware of the stereotype.

Applying this to the question, a child from a minority group who is perceived as being involved in criminal activity is likely to become *more* involved in criminal activity after becoming aware of the stereotype. This is because the stereotype can create a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The rest of the paragraph provides an example of this.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

* **A: ኣብ እቶም ክረኽብዎ ዝደልዩ ሒደት ዓሌታት (In the few races they want to acquire)** This option is unrelated to the passage.
* **C: ምስ ካልኦት ቖልዑ ዘለዎም ርክባት (Their interactions with other children)** While racial stereotypes *could* indirectly influence interactions, the passage focuses more on the direct impact on the child's *own* behavior and performance.
* **D: ኣብ ትርጉም ዓሌቶም (In the meaning of their race)** While a child's understanding of their racial identity might be affected long-term, the passage's immediate example is about performance in school, which is a behavioral outcome.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes ""feral"" children who lack social skills and are often raised in isolation or by animals.
*   A strong ability to communicate is a direct result of social interaction and learning language within a human community. Feral children would, by definition, lack this ability.
*   The other options (independence, possessiveness, social anxiety) are personality traits that could be present to some degree even in a child raised without normal social interaction."

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses ""feral children"" and their lack of social interaction. The primary point is that these children develop differently and often exhibit ""harmful behavior"" because they haven't had normal social contact.
*   The other options are incorrect because:
    *   A: While the passage mentions physical or mental disabilities as a *possible* reason parents neglect a child, it doesn't say it's the *main* reason for harmful behavior.
    *   C: The passage doesn't say harmful behavior is *only* for children neglected by parents. It also mentions children raised by animals.
    *   D: The passage talks about disabilities but not *all* harmful behaviors coming from a severe disability."

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""ከምዚኦም ዝመሰሉ ናይ ዓወት ታሪኻት ነቲ ናይ ለውጢ ፍርሒ የጉድልዎ"" (Such success stories reduce the fear of change). And the ""ዓወት ታሪኻት"" (success stories) it refers to are the ones about rekindling the ""ናይ ቐደም ኢንተርፕሪነየር ፀባይ"" (former entrepreneurial spirit).

Let's look at the other options:

* **B: ብዛዕባ እቶም ባህሊ ናይቲ ትካል ዝጸለዉ ሰባት ትኹረት ምርካብ (Focusing on the people who influenced the institution's culture):** While the passage mentions learning about individuals who shaped the organization's culture, the *success stories* specifically, not just knowing about people, are what reduce fear.
* **C: ናይቲ ትካል መበገሲ ምኽንያታት ምድላይ (Investigating the reasons for the institution's origin):** This is not explicitly mentioned as a fear reducer. While it might provide context, the success stories are the direct mechanism for lessening fear.
* **D: ታሪኽ ናይቲ ትካል ምርዳእ (Understanding the history of the institution):** The passage states understanding history helps one know their role, but it doesn't say it directly reduces fear like the recalling of successful entrepreneurial behaviors does."
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ብዛዕባ ታሪኽ ሓደ ሰብ ምርዳእ ብምእንታይ ክሕገዝ ይኽእል?,"The correct answer is **C: ኣብ ውሽጢ እቲ ትካል ቦታ ኣለኒ ብምባል** (C: Feeling like you have a place within the organization).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ናይ ሓደ ታሪኽ ምርዳእ ማለት ባህሊ ምርዳእ ማለት እኳ እንተዘይኮነ ግን እንተነኣሰ ኣብቲ ታሪኽ ዘለካ ግደ ክትፈልጥ ይሕግዝ"" which translates to: ""Understanding a history, while not the same as understanding a culture, at least helps you to know your role in that history."" Knowing your role in the history of an organization directly relates to feeling like you have a place within it.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: ፍርሂ ለውጢ ብምንካይ (Reducing fear of change):** While the passage does mention that success stories help reduce the fear of change, this is a *consequence* of understanding the history. The initial benefit of understanding the history is knowing your place.

*   **B: ክብርታት ብምድልዳል (Strengthening values):** The passage talks about examining values, but it's more about rediscovering them than strengthening them directly through historical understanding.

*   **D: ናይ ስራሕ ጠባይ ብምምሕያሽ (Improving work ethic):** While a better understanding of organizational history *could* indirectly improve work ethic, it's not the primary, direct benefit the passage emphasizes.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate and direct answer based on the provided text."

* **Other options are not directly supported:**
    * **A & C** Options A and C suggest that some experiences or methods are better than others. This contradicts the core idea of postmodern education, which is that there isn't one superior approach.
    * **B** Although the passage touches on the importance of experience and connecting to existing knowledge, it doesn't say education *must* focus on what we already believe. It's about the interaction between experience and presented knowledge.
"
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ሓሳባት ብዛዕባ ኣቀራርባ ድሕረ-ዘበናዊ ኣገባብ ትምህርቲ ብልክዕ ዘይገልጽ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ገሊኦም ተመኩሮታት ትምህርቲ ካብ ካልኦት ንላዕሊ ቀዳምነት ክወሃቦም ኣለዎም (Some learning experiences should be prioritized over others).**

Here's why:

*   **The passage emphasizes the lack of a single ""best"" way to learn.** Postmodern education, as described, rejects the idea of a hierarchy of learning experiences. It focuses on the individual's experience and interaction with information.

*   **Option B contradicts this core idea.** By suggesting that some learning experiences *should* be prioritized, it implies a ranking or system of value, which is against the postmodern approach described.

The other options align with the passage:

*   **A: ሓበሬታ ክትመሃረሉ ትኽእለሉ ብዙሓት ምንገዲታት ኣለዉ (There are many ways you can learn information):** This supports the idea that there is no single ""best"" way to learn.
*   **C: ተመኮሮ ትምህርቲ ኣብቲ መምሃራይን ኣብቲ ዝቐረበ ፍልጠትን እዩ ዝምርኮስ (Learning experience depends on the learner and the presented knowledge):** This aligns directly with the passage's statement that learning occurs between the student's experience and the knowledge presented.

Therefore, only **B** expresses an idea that is *not* consistent with the passage's description of postmodern education."

Here's why:

*   The text describes sleep interruption as a process of waking up briefly (10-60 minutes) and then going back to sleep. Turning off the alarm and going back to sleep for 20 minutes defeats the purpose of the planned, short interruption. The intention is to wake, be conscious, and then deliberately return to sleep, not to simply snooze the alarm.
*   Options A, B, and D don't directly relate to interrupting sleep in the specific way described in the text."

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states that the re-sleeping period should be short: **10-60 minutes (10-60 ደቃይቅ)**. Two hours (120 minutes) is significantly longer than the suggested duration.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: ኣብ ለውጢ እተመስረተ ክኸውን ይኽእል እዩ (It can be change-based.)** This is plausible. The passage suggests changing the alarm's location or fluid intake, implying adjustments based on needs.
*   **B: እቲ ሽቶ ሙሉእ ብሙሉእ ባዕልኻ ንኽይትበራበር እዩ (The goal is not to fully wake yourself.)** This aligns with the passage's emphasis on using a relatively quiet alarm to avoid full alertness.
*   **C: እቲ መስርሕ ኣብ እዋን ስሩዕ ድቃስ እዩ ዝግበር (The process takes place during regular sleep.)** The passage explicitly states ""ናይ ድቃስ ምቁርራፅ ኣብ እዋን መደበኛ ድቃስካ..."" (Sleep fragmentation during your regular sleep...).

Therefore, option D is the only one that inaccurately describes sleep curtailment/fragmentation as presented in the passage."
ሓንጎል ብተደጋጋሚ ሕልሚ ክሓልም ክፍትን እንከሎ፡ እንታይ እዩ ዝውስኽ?,"The correct answer is **B: መጠን ጸዓት**.

The passage states that frequently trying to dream ""taxes the brain,"" which implies an increase in energy expenditure. The other options are not directly linked to the brain being ""taxed"" by frequent dreaming.
"
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣሉታዊ ጽልዋታት ኣብ ሰውነትና ብተደጋጋሚ ክሕለም ዝፍተን ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ኣብ ምስ ውንኻ ከለኻ ሕልሚ ይምርኮስ** (It relies on the brain trying to dream repeatedly throughout the night when you are conscious).

Here's why:

The passage states that repeatedly inducing lucid dreams is tiring because the *brain* is constantly trying to dream throughout the night. This constant ""trying"" is what leads to fatigue. Option C is the closest description of what happens when the brain is trying to dream repeatedly throughout the night because when someone is aware they are dreaming, it relies on that person's brain being conscious.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኣብ መንጎ REM ዝነበረ ንውሓት ግዜ ይንኪ** (The length of time between REM decreases): The passage actually says the opposite: artificially induced lucid dreams lead to a *longer* period between REM phases.

*   **B: ንሕድሕድ ለይቲ ዝበጽሕ REMs ይንኪ** (REMs reached each night decreases): The passage doesn't directly say that the *number* of REM cycles decreases, but that the *time spent* in effective REM sleep decreases.

*   **D: ንሕድሕድ ለይቲ ዝበጽሕ REMs ይውስኽ** (REMs reached each night increases): The passage doesn't directly say that the *number* of REM cycles increases, and there isn't evidence from the passage that is increases.

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""ህላወ ናይ ሓቀኛ “ስዉር ጉጅለ” (ላርሰንን ላፋስቶንል፡ 1989, ገጽ109) ፍሉይ ኣካል ናይ ሓደ ጉጅለ ትርኢት እውን እዩ። እቲ “ዘይረአ ጉጅለ” ኩሉ ኣባል ሪፖርት ዝገብረሉ ናይ ምምሕዳር ጉጅለ እዩ."" Which translates to: ""The existence of a real 'invisible group' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a special aspect of a group's perspective. The ""unseen group"" is the management group to which every member reports.""
*   While the text discusses differences in independence and time zones, it explicitly states that *all* members report to an ""unseen group.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text does not explicitly state that all groups are expected to play at the same level.
*   **B:** The text focuses on the different levels of independence between online and traditional groups, not similarities.
*   **D:** The text states that online groups are in different time zones.

Therefore, **C** is the only option that accurately reflects a similarity between traditional and online groups as described in the passage."

*   Options B, C, and D directly relate to content theories by talking about environment and actions, internal desires, and understanding people's preferences.
*   Option A talks about desires that arise with age. The passage mentions desires intrinsic to humans as they grow.

So, A is the least connected to the core ideas of content theory as described in the text."

Here's why:

*   **A: እቲ ርእሰ ጉዳይ ኣበይ ክህሉ ከምዝኽእል መሰረት ምፍጣር (Creating a basis for where the subject can be located):** The Rule of Thirds provides guidelines on where to position the subject for visual interest.

Option D is more of a general principle of good composition, but not specifically what the Rule of Thirds does. The Rule of Thirds contributes to order, but its primary purpose is to create visual interest and dynamism, not just general order."

Here's why:

*   The passage states that 35mm film's aspect ratio (calculated from its dimensions) is 3:2. It then mentions that most standard formats are either equal to or close to this aspect ratio. So, 35mm film *does* have a standard aspect ratio.
*   The passage explicitly states that 35mm film is still being produced (A).
*   The passage explicitly states that its aspect ratio has been adopted by electronic (digital) cameras (B).
*   The passage explicitly states that 35mm film is the most common format in the world (D).

Therefore, C is the only statement that contradicts the information in the passage."
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ኣፍረይቲ ምህርቲ ሌንሳት ጽሬቱ እንዳወስኸ ብዝከደ ቁጽሪ፡ መጒልሒ ሌንሳት ብኸመይ እንዳተመሓየሹ መጺኦም?,"Let's analyze the text and the question to determine the correct answer.

The question asks how zoom lenses have improved over time due to manufacturers achieving higher standards. The text states:

*   ""This issue is becoming less of a problem as lens manufacturers achieve higher standards in lens production."" This implies improvements are happening.
*   ""This lens specification, when compared to lenses with a fixed focal length, has made it possible to produce clearer images."" This suggests that **image clarity** has improved to be comparable with fixed focal length lenses.

Now let's examine the answer choices:

*   **A: ዝለዓለ ናይ ሌንስ ፍጥነት ኣለዎም** - The text explicitly mentions that the aperture (which is related to lens speed) is *smaller* on zoom lenses compared to what would be ideal. Therefore, this is incorrect.

*   **B: ትሑት ብርሃን ኣብ ዘለዎ ኩነታት ክትጥቀምሎም ዝቐለሉ እዮም** - The text says the opposite: ""This makes for inferior lenses that are difficult to use without any light in low light conditions."" Thus, this option is incorrect.

*   **C: ናይቲ ስእሎም ጽሬት ቀዋሚ ንውሓት ማእከል ምስ ዘለዎም ስእልታት ይመሳሰል** - This is a direct paraphrase of the text ""This lens specification, when compared to lenses with a fixed focal length, has made it possible to produce clearer images."" This indicates that the image quality is closer to that of prime lenses. This looks like the correct answer.

*   **D: ካብ ቀንዲ ሌንሳት ዝወሓደ ማእከል ሕልኽላኻት ኣለዎም** - The text states that zoom lenses have *more* complexity and numbers to achieve various focal lengths. This is incorrect.

**Therefore, the correct answer is C: ናይቲ ስእሎም ጽሬት ቀዋሚ ንውሓት ማእከል ምስ ዘለዎም ስእልታት ይመሳሰል**

**C: ኣብ ጸልማት መብራህቲ ክትጥቀም እንተዘደሊኻ (If you want to use it in low light)**

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ዝለዓለ ነጥቢ ቀዳምነት ዝወሃቦ እንተድኣኾይኑ (If high point is given priority):** The text doesn't specifically mention a high point, this is not the best reason to choose a zoom lens.
*   **B: ዝወሓደ ባእታታት ሌንስ እንተድኣደሊኻ (If you want the least lens elements):** Zoom lenses typically have more lens elements, not fewer, than prime lenses.
*   **D: ዝያዳ ማእከል ሕልኽላኻት እንተደሊኻ (If you want more center complexities):** Zoom lenses are characterized by this complexity."

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes *individual* or *direct* experience and insight into the divine. The focus is on personal understanding and realization, not on communal or shared experiences.

*   The other options align with the text's description of mysticism:
    *   **A: ናይ መለኮታዊ ክውንነት ናይ ምፍላጥ ኽእለት ምድላይ (Seeking the ability to know the divine reality)** - This is a core goal of mysticism.
    *   **C: ኣብ ሓጎስ ዝመልኦ ኩነታት ሕልና ምትኳር (Focusing consciousness in a joyful state)** - The passage mentions focusing on ""joy in peaceful contemplation.""
    *   **D: ብዛዕባ ኣምላኽ ንቑሕ ምዃን (Being aware of God)** - Mysticism seeks direct conscious awareness of God or ultimate reality."

Here's why:

The passage states:

*   ""ርእሲ ምፍታው ኩሉ ጊዜ ምሳና ብሓንሳብ ክኸውን ኢዩ"" - Self-interest is always with us.
*   ""ርእሲ ኣፍቃሪ ንግዚኡ ብዙሕ ክጥቀም ይኽእል እዩ"" - A self-interested person can benefit greatly for a time.

This directly implies that if someone focuses on immediate gains, they are likely to prioritize their own benefit or self-interest."

    *   Use of morphine (from poppy seeds) and scopolamine (from henbane seeds).
    *   Use of tourniquets and arterial clamps to prevent blood loss from gangrene.
    *   Surgical skill in treating gangrene.

*   **The passage does NOT mention:**
    *   Treatment of post-traumatic stress with sedatives.

Therefore, Option A represents a medical practice *not* explicitly stated in the passage."

Here's why:

*   **A: ምፍጣር ናይሕክምና ሰራዊት (Creation of a medical army):** The passage states that a medical army was created.
*   **B: ኣዕናዊ ወተሃደራዊ ፖሊሲ ሃጸያዊት ግዝኣት (Destructive military policy of the imperial empire):** The passage references that the Roman Empire had a military nature and that doctors were able to develop and help establish a Roman medical army.
*   **D: ምምልማል ዶክተራት ብሃጸይ (Recruitment of doctors by the emperor):** The passage mentions that doctors began to be enrolled by Emperor Augustus.
*   **C: ምምስራት ናይ ትምህርቲ ሆስፒታላት (Establishment of teaching hospitals)**: The passage does not mention the establishment of teaching hospitals.

Therefore, the establishment of teaching hospitals is the only option not mentioned in the text as an advancement in medicine during the Roman Empire."

The first sentence of P directly states that sight relies on the organ system or eyes. While the other options touch upon aspects of sight mentioned later in the passage, they are not the core, fundamental dependence of sight.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""ከከም ብቕዓታት እቲ ተህዋስያን እተሓላለኸ እተፈላለየ ዓይነት ኣዒንቲ ኣሎ (according to the capabilities of the organisms, there are different types of complex eyes)."" This directly links the differences in eye structure to the capabilities the organism needs.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as good:

*   A: ስምዒት ንውሓት ማዕበል (Sensation of wavelength): While the passage mentions sensitivity to different wavelengths, it's a result of the different eye structures, not the cause of them. The *reason* for the eye structure is the organism's needs.
*   C: ደረጃ ብልሒ (Level of intelligence): The passage doesn't focus on the intelligence level.
*   D: ናይቲ ኣካል ሕልኽላኽ (Complexity of the organ): While eye complexity *does* differ, it's linked to the capability the organism needs, so option B is more accurate.

**In short:** The passage explicitly states that the variety of eye structures depends on the capabilities required by the organism. So the answer is (B)."

Here's why:

*   **A: ሲኪዝም ውጺኢት ናይቲ ኣብ ልምዲታት ሂንዱ ዝተፈጠረ ምኽፍፋል እዩ (Sikhism is a result of the division that occurred in Hindu practices)** is accurate. The passage states that Sikhism emerged in the 15th century from dissent within Hindu practices.

*   **B: እቲ መራሒነቲ ሲኪዝም መሰረታዊን ፍሉይን መዳይ እዩ (The leadership of Sikhism is a fundamental and unique aspect)** is also true.

*   **D: ገሊኡ ልምዲታት ሲኪዝም ኣብ ሂንዱይዝም እተመስረተ እዩ (Some practices of Sikhism are based on Hinduism)** is explicitly stated in the passage.

However, the question asks which statement **most accurately** reflects the religion according to the text. While the others are true, choice D is the most direct and comprehensive summary of Sikhism's relationship to Hinduism as presented in the passage. The passage specifically mentions that while Sikhs see their religion as distinct, they acknowledge its origins and practices are rooted in Hinduism.

Therefore, **D** is the best answer."

This translates to: ""These children get into a lot of trouble because their brains cannot function in the usual way, so to try to stimulate their brains, they engage in ""risky behavior, quarrelsome, and defiant of authority.""

Therefore, children with ADD tend to engage in risky behaviors because their brains need more stimulation due to the way they process information.

ኣብ ከበሳ ጊዛ እንታይ ክርከብ ይኽእል?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: ዓብዪ ፒራሚድ**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states the ""ጊዚ ኔክሮፖሊስ"" (Giza plateau) contains ""ብዙሓት ፕራሚዳት"" (many pyramids), ""ብዙሓት ኣናእሽቲ መቓብር"" (many smaller tombs), ""ብዙሓት ሓወልቲታት"" (many statues), and ""እቲ ዓብይ ሶፊኒክስ"" (the great sphinx).
*   While tombs (A) and temples (B) are mentioned, the text does not explicitly state these are specifically found in the Giza plateau.
*   The text states the ""ዓባይ ፒራሚድ"" is one of the things located in the Giza plateau and the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still exists.
*   Option C is incorrect because only one of the seven wonders is located there.

So, the best answer is **D**."
ናይቲ ዓብዪ ፒራሚድ ዕላማ እንታይ እዩ ነይሩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ንፈርዕን ንምኽባር (to honor the Pharaoh)**.

The passage explicitly states that the Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu.

The passage states that Strabo, a Greek historian, later revealed the name of Herostratus, the arsonist. The Ephesians tried to erase his name from history, but Strabo is credited with preserving it.
"
ብዛዕባ ዳግማይ ምህናጽ ንቤት-መቕደስ ናይ ኣርተሚስ እቲ ቕኑዕ መግለጺ እንታይ እዩ?,"Let's analyze the provided text to determine the correct answer.

*   The text states the temple was destroyed on the night Alexander the Great was born.
*   Alexander offered to pay for its reconstruction but was refused.
*   It was rebuilt after Alexander's death in 323 BCE.

Based on this information, the correct answer is:

**B: ድሕሪ መግዛእቲ ናይ ኣሌክሳንደር ዘ ግረይት ዳግማይ ተሃነጸ** (Rebuilt after the death of Alexander the Great)

This is because the text specifies that the temple was rebuilt after Alexander's death.

Here's why:

* The passage states ""ወዲ ሰብ አብ ዘመነ ሆሞ ኢሬክተስ(ማለት ቅኑዕ ሰብኣይ) ብእግሩ ጠጠወ ኢሉ ምኳድ ጀመሩ"" which translates to ""Humans in the Homo Erectus era started walking upright."" While the passage mentions other hominids that *may* have walked on two legs, it specifically identifies Homo Erectus as when upright walking *began*.
"
ኣብ ካልኣይ ኩናት ዓለም እቲ ናይ ጀርመን ሓይሊ ባሕሪ እንታይ ክፍጽም ይፍትን ነይሩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ብሪጣንያ ሰባት ከምኡዉን ጥረ-ነገራት ንኸይትቕበል ምኽልኻል**

The passage states that the German navy, primarily using U-boats, was trying to stop traffic across the Atlantic. The goal was to prevent the Americans from transporting personnel and supplies. This action would hinder Britain's ability to receive these resources.
"

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ኣሜሪካውያን ሰባቶምን እቑሑቶምን ካብ ውቅያኖስ ኣትላንቲክ ንምውጻእ እናሞኮሩ ነይሮም።"" This indicates the Americans were trying to move supplies and people across the Atlantic.
* **The passage also states:** ""...እቶም መሻርኽቲ ተዝወድቁ ኔሮም ጀርመን ከምቲ ዝተረፈ ኣውሮፓ ዝገበረቶ ንብሪቴን እውን ከትቆጻጸራ ኔራ እያ።"" This implies that the Allies (including the British) *succeeded* in preventing Germany from controlling Britain, which would have been the outcome if the German U-boats had been more successful in stopping the Atlantic convoys.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the British and Americans were the more successful side in the naval conflict during the Battle of the North Atlantic."

* While festivals and celebrations may involve priests, the passage doesn't state it's *exclusively* for them.
* Ziggurats were part of the temple complex, but not solely for priests. The top was a special shrine for the god."
ንጉስ ቱታንኩማን መዓስ እዩ ነቲ ሕማቕ ግብሩ ተፈላጥነት ዝረኸበ?,"The correct answer is **C: ድሕሪ ምርካብ መቓብሩ** (After the discovery of his tomb).

The passage states that Tutankhamun became famous after his tomb was discovered in 1922. Although he was not considered very important during his time and wasn't even listed on most king lists, the discovery of his undisturbed tomb brought him fame.
"
ንንጉስ ቱታንኩማን ኣዝዩ ፍሉጥ ናይ ኢጅብታዉያን ንጉስ ክገብሮ ዝኽኣለ እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ርኽበት ናይቲ ዘይተነቓነቐ መቓብሩ (The discovery of his undisturbed tomb)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""ይኹን እምበር ብ1922 መቓብሩ ምስ ተረኽበ ውሩይ ኮነ (However, he became famous when his tomb was discovered in 1922).""  This directly links the discovery of his tomb to his fame. The fact that the tomb was largely undisturbed is key because it contained a wealth of artifacts that captured the world's imagination.
"
እቲ ናይ ግሪኽ ገጣሚ ሆመር ክገብሮ ዘይከኣለ ነገር እንታይ ነበረ?,"The correct answer is **B: ክሪኢ**.

The passage states that Homer was a blind poet. Blindness means the inability to see."
ካብ ስነ-ጽሑፍ ወጻኢ ዝፍለጥ ዉሩይ ግሪኻዊ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is C: ፓይታጎሮስ (Pythagoras).

The passage explicitly states that Pythagoras was a mathematician, making him famous outside of literature. The other options (Sophocles, Homer, and Aristophanes) are all figures associated with literature and theater.
"
እቶም ስድራ ናይ ሀብሪው ዝበዝሐ ግዚኦም ኣበይ የሕልፍዎ ነይሮም?,"Based on the provided text (P), the most accurate answer is:

*   **A: ኣብ ክፉት ቦታ** (In the open place/outdoors)

The text explicitly states: ""መብዛሕትኡ ህይወት ስድራ ቤት እብራውያን ኣብ ግዳም እዩ ኣጋጢሙ"" which translates to ""Most of the life of a Hebrew family happened outdoors."""
ነቶም እብራውያን ስድራቤት ብዙሕ ኣገዳሲ ዘይነበረ ነገር እንታይ ነይሩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ቤቶም (Their house)**.

The passage explicitly states that the house was not as important in the warm climate of the Middle East because most of Hebrew family life happened outdoors.
"

This implies differences in the *people* (D), *customs* (C), and *history* (A).  The passage doesn't mention geographical differences or whether they share land.

Therefore, the answer is B: እቲ መሬት.
"
ኣብ ግሪንላንድ መጀመርታ ዝሰፈረ መን እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ቐቢላ እስኪሞ (Tribal Eskimo)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""እንተዀነ ግን እቲ ዝረኸቦ ርኽበት ብዘየገድስ ኣብቲ ግዜ እቲ ዓሌታት ኢስኪሞ ድሮ ኣብኡ ይነብሩ ነበሩ ።"" which translates to ""However, regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.""

This implies that wealthy Romans, in general, preferred to recline while eating. While the passage does not explicitly state which sex the wealthy Romans who preferred to recline are, the available options provide an answer that is likely to be the correct one.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: ሃብታማት ሮማዉያን ኣሰብኡት (Wealthy Roman men)**
"
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ክፋል ናይ ጥንታዊ ሮማዊ በዓል ክኸዉን ዘይክእል ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **D: ሸሓኒ ናይ ዝተጠበሰ ታኪን (A plate of roasted turkey)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Romans were unfamiliar with turkey. Therefore, turkey could not have been served at a Roman feast.
*   The passage explicitly mentions exotic foods like dormice and oryx, as well as differences in dining practices between the rich and poor.
*   The passage mentions exotic foodstuff like ""ኣረነ""."

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ንኣሽቱ ባህልታት ብዙሕ ጊዜ ኣገባብ ዘለዎም ታሪኻዊ መርትዖታት ብዘይምግዳፍ ይጠፍኡ አዮም ስለዚ ድማ ከም ሓቀኛ ስልጣነ ክፍለጡ ኣይክእሉን እዮም።""  This translates to: ""Small cultures often disappear without leaving behind systematic historical evidence and therefore cannot be considered true civilizations.""

The other options are related to civilization and are thus more likely to have a lasting impact:

* **ማሕበረሰብ (Mahbereseb - Society):** Civilization is defined as a complex society.
* **ከተማ-ግዝኣት (Ketema-Gizi'at - City-State):** The passage explicitly mentions city-states as precursors to nations and linked to the origin of the word ""civilization"".
* **ዝማዕበለ ባህሊ (Zema'ebele Bahli - Developed Culture):** Civilization implies a developed and lasting culture.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the Qing Dynasty took control of Taiwan in 1683, *after* the Dutch East India Company's presence. The Dutch didn't willingly give up control; they were displaced.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኣብ ደብባዊ ምዕራብ ክፋል ናይቲ ደሴት መዕረፊ ገይሮም (Establishing a base in the southwest part of the island)**: The passage explicitly states the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan.

The passage explicitly states: ""መጠን ፒኤች ብመጠን ሃይድሮጅን (ኤች አብ ፒኤች) እዩ ዝልካዕ (The pH value is measured by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH)).""
"

This directly translates to: ""Hydrogen ions are protons that have completely lost their electrons (hydrogen atoms contain one proton and one electron).""
"
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ መግለጺታት ዕስለ ናይ ኣናብስ ብቕኑዕ ዘይገልጽ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **C: እቶም ተባዕትዮን ኣንስትዮን ብቐረባ ዝዛመዱ እዮም (The males and females are closely related)**.

Here's why:

*   **A: ምስ ዕስለ ኣኻልብ ተመሳሳሊ ጠባይ የርእዩ (They show similar behavior to a pack of wolves)** - This is stated directly in the passage (""ስድራ ኣንበሳ ከም ጉጅለ ናይ ተኹላ ወይ ከልቢ ዝተመሳሰለ ባህሪ ኣሎዎ።"").

*   **B: እቲ ናይ ሰብኣይ ንሰበይቲ ጉዚ ማዕረ ኣይኮነን (The ratio of males to females is not equal)** - The passage describes a pride with up to three males and thirty females, so this statement is true.

*   **D: ቐተልትን ሕዉሳትን እዮም (They are deadly and mixed)** - The passage states they are deadly hunters and describes the family structure. It doesn't mention ""mixed,"" but the implication is that the pride consists of related females and cubs along with a small number of males, making it a somewhat mixed social group.

*   **C: እቶም ተባዕትዮን ኣንስትዮን ብቐረባ ዝዛመዱ እዮም (The males and females are closely related)** - The passage explicitly states that the females are closely related to each other (""እተን ደቀንስትዮ መብዛሕትኡ ግዜ ኣባላት ብዙሓት ኣሕዋትን ውላድን ዘለዎ ስድራ ኮይነን ነንሕድሕደን ዝቀራረባ እየን"" - The females are mostly members of a family with many siblings and children and are close to each other). It does not say that the males are related to the females. The males are described as being related to each other but not necessarily to the females in the pride.

Therefore, option C is the statement that is NOT accurately describing lion prides according to the provided text."

*   **A, B, and C** are all supported by the passage:

    *   **A: ኣዝዮም ሕዉሳት እዮም(Very sociable):** The passage explicitly states lions live in groups (ቡጉጅለ ዝነብሩ) and are highly social (ማሕበራውያን).
    *   **B: ባህርያቶም ምስ ናይ ተዃሉ ዝዛመድ እዩ(Their behavior is similar to that of wolves):** The passage draws a comparison between lion prides and wolf packs.
    *   **C: ተባሕትዮን ኣንስትዮን ንተሃዳናይ እንስሳ ኣዝዮም ቐተልቲ እዮም(Both males and females are very deadly to prey):** The passage states that they are ""ኣዝዮም ቐተልቲ"" towards their prey.

Therefore, only option D is incorrect based on the information provided in the text."

The other options are mentioned in the paragraph as hunting methods for Ocelots:

Here's why:

*   The passage states that researchers believe ocelots use their sense of smell to track and find their prey. This directly contradicts the statement that their sense of smell is weak.

The other options are all true based on the text:

*   **A: ለይቲ ብጽቡቕ ክሃድኑ ይኽእሉ (They can hunt well at night)** - The passage says they can see well at night.
*   **B: ብጽሞና ይንቀሳቐሱ (They move silently)** - The passage states they can move slowly and unnoticed.
*   **D: ንኣሽቱ እንስሳታት ክሃድኑ ይመርጹ (They prefer to hunt small animals)** - The passage lists examples of small animals they hunt (lizards, snakes, insects, birds)."
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ናይ ነብሪ ዝለዓለ ዓቕሙ ተባሂሉ ክሕሰብ ዘይክእል ኣየናይ እዩ?,"Let's analyze the provided information and the options:

*   **P** describes the tiger's abilities: all-around athlete, can roar, can purr, can jump long distances, pull five times its strength. It also mentions that tigers, lions, leopards and jaguars belong to the same genus and are the only big cats that can roar. Tiger's roar isn't like a lion's, but they can purr and make howling sounds.
*   **Q** asks: Which of the following is LEAST likely to be considered a tiger's ability?

Let's examine the options:

*   **A: ምግዓር (Roaring):** The passage says tigers can roar (though it's different from a lion's roar). So, this is an ability.
*   **B: ምሑኻር (Purring):** The passage explicitly says tigers can purr. So, this is an ability.
*   **C: ምንጣር (Leaping):** The passage says they can jump great distances. So, this is an ability.
*   **D: ምስሓብ (Pulling/Dragging):** The passage says it can pull five times its strength. So, this is an ability.

The question is asking for what is LEAST likely to be considered an ability of a tiger. All the options are mentioned within the passage so none can really be deemed as least likely to be considered an ability. Considering the description given to roaring vs purring and the strength aspect, the best answer is most likely A.

Therefore, the answer is A."

Here's why:

* **Speciation needs a population to survive and evolve in a new environment.** The text explains that speciation occurs when a population becomes isolated and adapts to a new environment. If a small group fails to survive in the new location, there's no population left to undergo the changes necessary for speciation.
* **Options B, C, and D all align with the process of speciation described in the passage.**
    * **B: ክፋል ናይ ሓደ ህዝቢ ናብ ሓድሽ ከባቢ ምኻዶም (A part of a population moving to a new environment):** This is the initial step where a subset of a population is isolated, setting the stage for adaptation to a new environment.

Here's why:

*   **The passage describes speciation as occurring when a population becomes isolated and adapts to a new environment, eventually becoming so different from the original population that they can no longer interbreed.** The passage does not mention anything about a new population occurring when it cannot be assimilated. The focus is on adaptation and divergence, not the inability to integrate into an existing group.
*   **B: ንመስርሕ ዕብየት ኣገዳሲ መዳይ እዩ (It is an important aspect of the growth process)** The passage explicitly states that speciation is ""a very useful component of predictive change,"" which is essential for the evolutionary process.
*   **C: ንምምስራት ሓድሽ ዓልየታት ይምልከት (It involves the establishment of new lineages.)** The passage describes how speciation results in two groups of people becoming so different that they become their own species, which are then grouped into different lineages.
*   **D: ፍጻሜኡ ዘይተርፍ እዩ (Its outcome is inevitable.)** The passage states that speciation ""is an inevitable event,"" confirming that its result is unavoidable.

*   The passage *does* list egg-laying, bipedalism (walking on two legs), and scaly feet as shared traits between birds and dinosaurs.

The passage directly states that atoms release excess energy gained from light by emitting ""photons,"" and the process is called ""stimulated emission"" (ዝተነቓቕሐ ምዉጻእ) because the light stimulates the atoms.

Let's look at why the other options are not as accurate:

*   **A: ተረፍ ጽዓት ንምዉጻእ (To release excess energy):** While it's true that emitting a photon helps the atom get rid of excess energy, the *cause* of the photon emission is the excitation in the first place. This is a description of *why* they emit photons, not *what causes* them to emit photons.
*   **C: ዘይርጉእ ናይ ጽዓት ደረጃታት (Unstable energy levels):** While unstable energy levels are related to the overall process, the *direct cause* of emitting a photon within the context of the text is the excitation due to bright light.
*   **D: ጎናዊ ሳዕቤን ንጨረርታ (Side effect of radiation):** The passage doesn't directly mention radiation as the primary cause. The emphasis is on the *bright light* exciting the atoms."

Therefore, rockets are essential for placing telescopes (and satellites) into space.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""ብዑደት ዝፍፀሙ ዘለው ኩነታት በቢ ግዚኡ ተደጋጊሞም ዝፍጠሩ እዮም (By observing the events that take place cyclically, we can mark time. Events that happen in cycles repeat themselves at different times).""

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: ንውሓት ግዜ (Length of time)**: While time is related to duration, the question asks about recording the passage of time, not its length.
* **C: ጽልዋ (Influence/Impact)**: While time can have an impact on things, the focus here is on measuring or recording time.
* **D: ጸገም (Problem/Difficulty)**: While the passage mentions time can be difficult to understand, it doesn't directly relate to *how* we record its passage.

Here's why:

* **P states:** The text says that the heir to the throne is normally expected to go straight into the military after schooling.
* **Charles did something different:** He went to university *before* the military.

The other options are incorrect because they describe Charles's *unique* actions, not the standard practice. The passage makes it clear that going to university *before* the military was *not* typical.

The passage states that this influence occurred ""ኣብ ከባቢ መበል 15 ዘመን"" which translates to ""around the 15th century"". The 15th century was from 1401 to 1500. If we're currently in the 21st century, roughly 2024, then 2024 - 1500 = 524 years ago. The closest answer choice to 524 years is **C: ከባቢ ቅድሚ 600 ዓመት**.
"
ቛንቛ ናይ ኢስቶንያ ብምንታይ ተጸልዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: እቲ ናይ ጀርመን ቛላት (The German words)**.

* The passage states: ""...ዜ እናሓለፈ ምስ ከደ ካብ ጀርመን እተለቅሐ ሓያሎ ቓላት ተቐያየረ (As time passed, many words borrowed from German changed)."" This clearly indicates the influence of German words on the Estonian language.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

* **A: እቲ Õ/õ መለለዩ ጠባይ (The Õ/õ character)**: While the passage mentions the addition of the Õ/õ character, it was a *tool* used in writing the language, not the direct *influence* on the language itself.
* **C: ጀርመን ኣቕሽሽቲ (German priests)**: The German priests were the *agents* of change, but the *influence* itself was the introduction of German words and the adaptation of the alphabet.
* **D: ኣምላኽ (God)**:  While the priests wanted to introduce God, God himself wasn't the linguistic influence.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the Estonian language was influenced by **German words**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""ኣብ ትሕቲ ማሪያ ቀጢን ከምኡውን ኣብ በሪክቦታ ረጒድ እዩ"" which translates to ""It is thin under maria and thick on the highlands."" Maria refers to the seas on the moon.
*   **Option B** accurately reflects this information.
*   **Option A** is incorrect; the passage states the opposite.
*   **Options C and D:** are incorrect. The passage states the reason the side closest to the Earth had more ""seas"" or maria than the far side, not that more or fewer were under it."
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ሽፋን ናይ ወርሒ ዝረጎደ ክፋል ኣየናይ እዩ?,"Let's analyze the provided text:

*   ""ናይ ወርሒ ገፀ ምድሪ ካብኣኻውሕን ሓመድን ዝተሰረሐ እዩ።"" - The moon's surface is made of rocks and dust.
*   ""ላዕላዋይ ሽፋን ከውሒ ክረስት ይበሃል።"" - The upper layer is called the crust.
*   ""እቲ ቅርፍቲ ብቀረባ ናይ ኣስታት 70 ኪሜ፣ ኣብ ርሑቕ ድማ 100 ኪሜ ርጉዲ ኣለዎ።"" - The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
*   ""ኣብ ትሕቲ ማሪያ ቀጢን ከምኡውን ኣብ በሪክቦታ ረጒድ እዩ።"" - It is thinner under maria and thicker in highland areas.

The question asks which part of the moon's crust is thicker. The text states that the crust is thicker on the far side (100 km) compared to the near side (70 km) and also thicker in the highlands.

Now let's review the options:

*   A: ኣብቲ ዝቐረበ ክፋል (On the near side): The text says the crust is thinner on the near side.
*   B: ዝበዝሐ ኮኾብ ናይ ባሕሪ ዝርከበሉ (Where there are more stars of the sea): This option is irrelevant to the provided text.
*   C: ኣብ ትሕቲ እቲ ላዕለዋይ መሬት (Under the highlands): The text implies the crust is thick in highland areas.
*   D: ኣብ ትሕቲ ኮኾብ ናይ ባሕሪ (Under the star of the sea): This option is irrelevant to the provided text.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is C, because the text states that the crust is thicker in highland areas.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
**C: ኣብ ትሕቲ እቲ ላዕለዋይ መሬት**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ምስግጋር ናይ ቬኑስ (Transit of Venus):** While the transit of Venus is an interesting astronomical event, the passage doesn't directly state that it *supported* the Copernican theory in the same way that the phases of Venus did.
* **C & D: ናይ ጸሓይ ተመሳሰልነት ምስ ቬኑስ/ወርሒ (Solar similarity with Venus/Moon):**  These options aren't mentioned or implied in the passage in relation to the Copernican theory. The passage only mentions that the phases occur because the sunlit portion of Venus is what we observe.

*   Scientists are trying to replicate this process in a fusion reactor to generate power (energy).
*   While hydrogen is the fuel, stars are the place where the fusion happens, and atoms are involved, the useful product is energy."

The molecular structure defines the chemical nature.  Water (ማይ) is given as an example, and the passage emphasizes that even in gas, liquid, or solid form, the water molecule (2 hydrogen + 1 oxygen) remains the same.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ጻዕቒ (Density):** The passage explicitly states that liquid nitrogen is denser than gaseous nitrogen, implying density changes with state.
* **C: ኣካላዊ ኩነታት (Physical State):** The passage directly states that the physical state *does* change.
* **D: ፈሳሲ ናይትሮጅን (Liquid Nitrogen):** This is a specific substance, not a property that remains constant during phase changes. While it's related to the overall topic, it doesn't answer the question about what *doesn't* change.

The text explicitly mentions eliminating British bases and ships in Egypt (option D) as part of the plan, and the need for assembly points and crossing the Mediterranean implies the formation of a task force. Additional ships may have been constructed but not clearly stated as a step required to take over African nations. The text states that additional ships were built before the war but does not state that it was a step to take over African nations.

Therefore, the answer is **B: ተወሰኽቲ መርከባት ምህናጽ (Building additional ships)**."
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ናይ ዓዲ-ጥልያን መሰረታዊ ዕላማ ናይቲ ኩናት እንታይ ይሕሰብ ነበረ?,"The correct answer is **A: ናይ ኣፍሪቓ ሃገራ ምሓዝ (Taking over the countries of Africa)**.

The text explicitly states that Italy's main goals were the countries of Africa. The rest of the information provided in the text is details of why and how they were planning to achieve this goal, but the core objective remains capturing African nations.
"
ምስ ገዛእቲ ምሕዝነታዊ ርክባት ዝመስረተ መን ነበረ?,"The correct answer is **B: ቪኪ ፈረንሳዉያን (Vichy French)**.

The passage explicitly states that the ""ቪቺ ፈረንሳይኛ"" were the ones who made peace with the Germans and collaborated with the invaders in 1940.
"

The passage explicitly states that ""ኣሜሪካዊያን ወታደራት ፈረንሳይን ንደቡብ ፈረንሳይ ነጻ ብምውጻእ ናብ ጀርመን ኣምሪሖም"" (American soldiers and French forces liberated southern France and advanced towards Germany). The term used for the French forces is ""ነጻ"" meaning free.
"
ሳብማሪን ትሕቲ ማይ ክጎዓዝ ዘኽኣለ ምዕባለ ናየናይ ቴክሎኖጂ ነይሩ?,"The correct answer is **D: ራዳር**.

The passage states that submarines were forced to stay underwater more often as radar technology improved, to avoid detection. This directly links the advancement of radar technology to the submarines' underwater operation.
"

The passage states: ""ኣብ ቀዳማይ ውግእ ዓለምን ኣብ ካልኣይ ውግእ ዓለምን ሳብማሪን ይጥቀሙ ነበሩ ። ኣብቲ ግዜ እቲ ኣዝዮም ደንጓዪ ኢዮም ነይሮም ብዙሕ ተዅሲ እውን ኣይነበሮምን."" This directly translates to ""Submarines were used in World War I and World War II. At that time, they were very slow and did not have much firepower."" This indicates that their ability to attack (ምቱካስ) was limited.
"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ነቲ ስምምዕ መን ጥሒስዎ? ,"The correct answer is **D: ሶቬት (Soviet)**.

The text explicitly states that the Soviet Union's Red Army, with over 800,000 soldiers, invaded eastern Poland, violating several treaties, including the Treaty of Riga and the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. This clearly indicates the Soviet Union broke the agreements.

The passage states that ""እንግሊዛውያን ን ናይ ጣልያን ዓስራይ ጦር ኢንጅነር ዋና ጀነራል ላስቱቺ ሒዞሞ"" which translates to ""The British captured the Italian Tenth Army Engineer-in-Chief Lastucci.""

ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ሜላታት ኣገዳሲ ክፋል ናይ ጸሎት ቲበታን ዝኾነ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The passage states that Kundalini Yoga, which involves breath control exercises, mantra repetition, and visualization, is a key part of Tibetan Buddhism. It also mentions visualization of deities as central to Tibetan meditation. Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: ናይ ምስትንፋስ ንጥፈታ ምልምማድ (Breath control exercises):** The passage explicitly mentions ""ናይ ምስትንፋስ ምንቅስቃሳት (breath movements)"" as part of Kundalini Yoga, which is described as a foundational part of Tibetan Buddhism.

*   **B: ምድግጋም ማንቱራታት (Repetition of mantras):** The passage explicitly mentions ""ማንትራን (mantras)"" as part of Kundalini Yoga.

*   **C: ምስኣል ጣኦታት (Visualization of deities):** The passage describes the ""ርእየት ናይ ዝተፈላለዩ መለኮታት (visualization of different deities)"" as central to Tibetan meditation, which is closely linked to prayer.

*   **D: ናይ ዮጋ ኣቓዉማ ምምላኽ (Practicing Yoga postures):** While the passage mentions Kundalini Yoga and Yoga in general, it does not specifically emphasize Yoga postures as the *most* important part of Tibetan Prayer.

While all of the options are touched on in the passage, options A, B and C are the most strongly supported. Option C is the most central because the passage mentions, ""እቲ ማእከል ናይ ቲበታዊ ኣስተንትኖ መለኮታዊ ዮጋ እዩ። ብ ርእየት ናይ ዝተፈላለዩ መለኮታት ኣቢሎም (The center of Tibetan meditation is divine yoga. Through the vision of different deities).

Therefore, the best answer is **C: ምስኣል ጣኦታት (Visualization of deities)**.
"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ኣብ እዋን ናይቲ “ማእከል” ናይ ቲበታን ጸሎት ዓንኬላት ብኸመይ ንጡፋት ይቕየሩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ብምስኣል ጣኦታት (by the visualization of deities)**.

The passage states: ""ብ ርእየት ናይ ዝተፈላለዩ መለኮታት ኣቢሎም, መትረባት ናይ ጽዓት ይጸርዩ, እቶም ቻክራታት ይነቓቕሑን ንቕሓት ናይ ክስተተ-ኣእምሮ ይፍጠርን."" This translates to ""Through the visualization of various deities, the subtle channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and awareness of the mind is created."" This directly supports option B as the mechanism for chakra activation during Tibetan meditation.
"

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: ጃይ ሻንካር ኮሆድሃሪ**.
"

The text states that ""ካብኡ ንድሓር፣ ላካሃ ሲንግህ ንብሃጃንስ ብምድራፍ መሪሕነት ወሰደ።"" This translates to ""After that, Lakha Singh took the lead by singing bhajans.""  The passage then describes the offering of the 108 chappan bhog, suggesting that Lakha Singh was singing bhajans during this food offering ceremony.

The passage states that Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina, and Haris Alexiou performed together before the Fire of Anatolia group. This makes their performance the second-to-last of the evening.
"

ኣብቲ መግለጺ ምርኩስ ብምግባር፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ መግለጺታት ሓቒ ዘይኮነ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"Based on the provided passage, here's the breakdown and the answer:

*   **P states:**
    *   Passengers were given water when waiting in 90-degree Fahrenheit heat.
    *   Fire Chief Scott Kouns mentioned it was a 90-degree day in Santa Clara.
    *   Being stuck on a roller coaster is uncomfortable.
    *   It takes at least an hour to get someone off.

Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: ኣብ ሳንታ ክላራ ሓዊ ነበረ (There was a fire in Santa Clara)** - The passage mentions a Fire Chief, but there's no direct mention or implication that there was an actual fire. The Fire Chief could simply be talking about a safety issue. Therefore, this statement is *likely* untrue based solely on this passage.
*   **B: ሰባት ኣብ ዝንከባለል ዕንክሊል ተታሒዞም ነበሩ (People were stuck on a roller coaster)** - The passage directly states that being stuck on a roller coaster is uncomfortable and that it takes at least an hour to get someone off, implying people were stuck.
*   **C: ገየሽቲ ማይ ተዋሂቦም (Passengers were given water)** - The passage explicitly states that passengers were given water.
*   **D: ነቲ ናይ መጀመርታ ሰብ ካብቲ መሳፈሪ ንምዉራድ እንተወሓድ 60 ደቓይቕ ወሲዱ (It took at least 60 minutes to get the first person off the ride)** - The passage states ""ሓደ ሰብ ንምውራድ እንተወሓደ ሓደ ስዓት ይወስድ።"" which translates to ""It takes at least an hour to get someone off"". An hour is 60 minutes.

**Conclusion**

The statement that is *not* true based on the information provided is **A: ኣብ ሳንታ ክላራ ሓዊ ነበረ (There was a fire in Santa Clara)**.

The text states: ""ናይ ሓዊ ሓለቓ ስኮት ካውንስ ከምዝበሎ “ኣብ ሳንታ ክላራ ብ 90ታት ዝልካዕ ሙቐት ዝነበሮ መዓልቲ እዩ ኔሩ።” “ኣብ ሮለረ ኮስተር ንዝኾነ ይኹን ንውሓት ግዘ ተኣጺኻ ምጽናሕ ምችው ኣይኾነን፤"" (Na'i ḥawi ḥaleqa sikoti kawunisi kemizibelo “Ābi santa kilāra bi 90tati zilikaʿi muq’eti zineberewo meʿāliti iyu nēru.” “Ābi rolerē kositeri nizihone yikuni niwiḥati gizē te'āṣi’ika misinaḥi mich’iwi āyikoneni;). This translates to ""Fire Captain Scott Kouns said, 'It was a day in Santa Clara with temperatures in the 90s.' 'It's not comfortable to be stuck on a roller coaster for any length of time;'""

Therefore, the Fire Captain gave an opinion on the discomfort related to the heat.
"
ብሰንኪ ናይ ሱናሚ ንጥፈታት ሕጽረት ናይ ኤሌትሪክ ኣበይ ነይሩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ቶንጋ**.

The passage states: ""ኸቢድ ጉድኣት ወይ ሽግር ኣብ ቶንጋ ኣይበፀሐን፣ ይኹን እምበር ሓይሊ ንግዚኡ ጠፊኡ ነይሩ..."" which translates to ""No serious damage or problem occurred in Tonga, however power was temporarily lost...""
"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ብሰንኪ ሕጽረት ኤሌትሪክ ቶነጋ ብኸመይ ተጸልያ?,"The correct answer is **D: ሰብ-ስልጣናት ኣገደስቲ መጠንቐቕታት ክረኽቡ ኣይከኣሉን (Authorities were unable to receive important warnings)**.

The passage explicitly states that the power outage prevented Tongan authorities from hearing the tsunami warnings issued by PTWC. Therefore, option D directly reflects the impact of the power outage. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ገለ ዕንወት ጸብጻብ ቐሪቡ ነይሩ (Some damage was reported)**: The passage mentions no significant damage.
*   **B: ሰብ-ስልጣናት ብዛዕባ ዝተላዕሉ መጠንቐቕታት ዜና ኣይበጽሖምን (Authorities did not receive news about raised warnings)**: Option D is more directly aligned with the text than option B.
*   **C: ናይ ጽፍሒ ባሕሪ ንባባት ተጸልዮም (Tidal readings were affected)**: While possible, the text doesn't directly state tidal readings were affected, only that the power outage impacted warning reception."

**Explanation:**

The passage states that the police could only measure Reid's speed when he slowed down to 160 km/h. This implies that most of the time, he was going *faster* than what their speed measuring equipment could reliably capture on the Harbour Bridge. Option C best reflects this idea that he was often going too fast for them to get an accurate reading as he sped past the bridge."

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that ""ናይ ባንዲ ኣመራርሓ ኩባንያ ኤችኬ ኣመራርሓ ኢንክ"" (The band's management company, HK Management Inc.) provided the explanation for the cancellation.

The passage states that ""ብዙሕ ነባሮ ቢሽከክ ነቶም ካብ ደቡብ ዝመጽኡ ሰልፈኛታት ንሕጊ ኣልቦነት ተሓተትቲ ይገበሩዎም"" which translates to ""Many Bishkek residents hold the protesters who came from the south responsible for the lawlessness.""

ምስራዝ ናይ ተኸታተሊ ናይ ንባብ ሬንቦዉ እንታይ ኣምጺኡ?,"The correct answer is **A: ዘይእኹል ገንዘብ (Insufficient funds)**.

The passage states that some people, including John Grant, believe that the cut in funding contributed significantly to the series' cancellation. Although the passage mentions John Grant's opinion, it primarily links him with the lack of funding as the cause, making option A the most accurate.

The passage states that the city authorities and the Anne Frank House museum argue that the tree is infected with fungus and poses a public health risk if it falls. This implies they believe it *should not* be preserved. Therefore, the opposite argument, that it *should* be preserved, is the argument that *was not* made by the authorities.

The passage clearly states: ""ወይዘሮ ኪርቸር ... ንፕሬዝዳንትነት ከም እትወዳደር ኣፍሊጣ"" which translates to ""Mrs. Kirchner ... announced that she will be running for President.""
"
ክርስቲና ፍረናንደዝ ዲ ኪርቸር ናይ ምዉድዳር ዕላማኣ ኣበይ ኣወጀት?,"The correct answer is **B: ኣብ ላ ፕላታ ዘሎ ኣብ ቡኖስ ኣሪስ ትያትር**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""ወይዘሮ ኪርቸር ኣብ ኣርጀንቲና ቤት ትያትር ንፕሬዝደንትነት ናይ ምውድዳር ድሌታ ዝፍለጠት እንትኾን ኣብ ቦነስ ኣይረስ ጠቕላላ ግዛኣት ልእኽቲ ኣባል ብምዃን ን 2005 ሰኔት ወፍሪ ዝጀመረትሉ ቦታ እዩ ነሩ."" This implies that she announced her candidacy in a theater in Buenos Aires, specifically in La Plata, which is 50 kilometers (approximately 31 miles) from Buenos Aires."
ብዛዕባ ቢግ ብራዘር ዝምልከት ርኽበታት ናይ ACMA እንታይ ነይሮም?,"The correct answer is **A: ሕግታት ናይ ምምያ ኣይተጣሕሱን (Laws of obscenity were not violated)**.

The premise (P) states that Big Brother did not violate online content control laws because the video, although available online, was not found hosted on Big Brother's website.  This implies that ACMA (Australian Communications and Media Authority) found that Big Brother had *not* violated the laws in question. Therefore, ACMA's findings were that laws were not violated.
"
ናይ ኢንተርነት ትሕዝቶ ተባሂሉ ንኽሕሰብ መርበብ ኣበየኖት መዐቐኒታት ክኣትዉ ኣለዎም?,"The correct answer is **B: ኣብ ሰርቨር ብኣካል ይቕመጥ ኣለዎ (Ab Server Bi'akali Yik'emeti Alewo) - It must be physically stored on a server.**

The passage explicitly states that for content to be considered ""internet content"" under the relevant law, it must be physically stored on a server.
"
ናይ ኣዉስትራልያ ሊበራል ፓርቲ መራሒ መን እዩ?,"Based on the text, the correct answer is **B: ጆን ሆዋርድ (John Howard)**.

The text states that Peter Costello was expected to replace John Howard as Prime Minister, implying that John Howard was the leader of the Liberal Party at the time.
"
ኣዉስትራልያ ንምንታይ እያ ክሳብ ሕጂ ትካል ኑክልየር ሓይሊ ዘይብላ?,"The passage only states that Peter Costello believes Australia should pursue nuclear power if it's economically viable. It doesn't explicitly state why Australia *currently* doesn't have nuclear power. However, Costello's statement implies that the reasons may be more related to economics than safety, controversy, or lack of public support. Since no direct answer is given, we must choose the most likely from the context. While safety, controversy, and lack of public support could all be factors, Costello's focus on economics suggests cost may be the primary barrier. 

Therefore, the most appropriate answer, based on the given information, is:

**D: ኣዝዩ ክቡር ብምንባሩ (Because it is very expensive)**
"
ኣየናይ ኣንሸራታቲ እዩ ብሓገዝ ዝዛዘመ?,"The correct answer is **C: ማቺጅ ክርዘል** (Machiej Krezel).

The text says ""ናይ ምርኣይ ስንክልና ዘለዎ ፖላንዳዊ ስኪየር ማኪያጅ ክሬዘልን መራሒቱ ኣና ኦጋርዚንካን..."" This means Machiej Krezel is a visually impaired skier who was guided. Ana Ogarzynska is his guide.

The text states that ""ፊንላንድ ምስ ናይ ካትጃ ሳሪነን 10ይ ክትውድእ ከላን እዩ"" which translates to ""Finland finished 10th with Katja Saarinen"". This clearly indicates that Finland's representative finished 10th in the women's Super-G.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically mentions the funds are intended for:
    *   Housing resistant to flooding (option C)
    *   Improved water management
    *   Crop diversification (option A - ""ምብዛሕ ዝራእቲ"")

*   It states that the UN hopes the funding will help countries adapt to the effects of global warming (option D).

*   The question asks for what the funds *are not* used for. While technology transfer to developing countries is mentioned in the first sentence as *another* topic in Bali's agenda, it is not specified that the funds from the UN for global warming will be specifically be used for this.
"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ሕቡራት ሃገራት እንታይ ከድሕኑ ይምነዩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ዝተረፉ ጫካታት (ዝተረፉ ጫካታት)**.

The passage explicitly states that ""ካልኦት ኣርእስታት ኣብ'ቲ ኣጀንዳ ናይ ባሊ፥ ዝተረፉ ጫካታት ዓለም ምዕቃብ..."" which translates to ""Other items on the Bali agenda: conserving the remaining forests of the world...""

Here's why:

*   The text states that the ""key basis"" is enough to start trade on July 1st, 2020. This implies that while not all details are finalized (like rules of origin and tariff concessions), enough agreements and frameworks are in place to begin. The language in the answer choice B corresponds to this implication.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While Nigeria's announcement is important context, the *reason* for the July start date is based on the sufficient progress made in the negotiations.
*   **C:** While the AU Commissioner's statement is relevant, their ""permission"" isn't the core *reason* trade is starting. It's that enough agreements are in place.
*   **D:** The text explicitly states that agreements on rules of origin and tariff concessions have *not* been reached yet.

Therefore, option B best reflects the text's explanation for why trade is starting in July despite outstanding details."

Here's why:

*   The passage states that *later* evidence showed test tampering. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution report came *before* this evidence.

The other options are present in the passage:

*   **A: ዘይልሙድ ምምሕያሽ ነጥብታት ናይ ምርመራ**: The passage explicitly mentions that test scores increased at an unbelievable rate.
*   **C: ናይ 2013 ናይታ ዓመት ተዓዋታይ ሃገራዊ ኣማሓደሪ**: The passage mentions that Hall was indicted along with other educational staff in 2013. Although she was not the *administrator of the year* in 2013, this answer is closer to being true than answer B.
*   **D: ርኢቶታት ናይ ከበሳ ትምህርቲ ንምምሕያሽ**: The passage does not explicitly mention suggestions to improve the education system. While it mentions the school district did nothing, it is still *possible* that the newspaper report had suggestions to improve the education system."

Here's why:

*   **P states:**
    *   A bomb exploded at the governor's office entrance.
    *   Three additional bombs were defused near a government building.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: ናይ መወዳእታ ቑጽሪ ሓደጋ** (The final casualty count) - The passage explicitly states the final number is *not* yet known.
*   **C: ተወሰኽቲ ቡንባታት ክፍንጀሩ እንተኾይኖም** (Whether additional bombs will explode) - The text doesn't say anything about future explosions.
*   **D: ወግዓዊ ናይ ሞት ክሳራ** (Official death toll) - The passage mentions conflicting reports and that the final number is unknown, so there isn't a confirmed official death toll at the time of the report."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ዝሞቱ ኣይነበሩን** - The text clearly states that the expected number of deaths is at least 15.
*   **B: ኩሎም ኣጋይሽ ካብ ሕቡራት ዓረብ ኢማራት ነበሩ** - The text says ""መብዛሕትኦም ዜጋታት ዩናይትድ ዓረብ ኢሚሬትስ እዮም ኔሮም"" which translates to ""Most of the hotel guests were citizens of the United Arab Emirates."" This means not all the guests were from UAE.
*   **D: መብዝሓትኦም ካብቶም ኣጋይሽ ናይ ሜካ ነበርቲ ነበሩ** - The text mentions that most of the hotel guests had come to visit the holy city for the Hajj pilgrimage, hence they were not residents."

Here's why:

* **A: ዓቐን ናይቲ ግጭት (Scale of the collision):** The passage states, ""ተመራመርቲ ከምዝሓበርዎ ብምኽንያት እቲ ግጭት ዝበፅሐ ፍንዳእታ ዓብዪ እዩ ነይሩ፡፡"" (Researchers reported that the explosion caused by the collision was large). While the exact magnitude isn't specified, the text *does* indicate it was significant. The uncertainty lies in the *impact* of that scale.
* **B: ቦታ ናይቲ ግጭት (Location of the collision):** The passage states the satellites collided ""ካብ ምድሪ 491 ማይል ልዒለን"" (491 miles above the earth). This establishes the location of the collision.
* **D: ቦታ ናይ ዝተሰባበረ (Location of the debris):** The passage mentions that the U.S. Strategic Command is tracking the debris and will post plotting analysis publicly. Although the locations are not immediately mentioned, the sentence implies the location will be made available.
* **C: ናይቲ ግጭት ጽልዋ ኣብ ምድሪ (The impact of the collision on Earth):** The passage specifically says, ""እቲ ግጭት ክንደየናይ ዓብዪ ከምዝነበረን፣ ብሰንኩ ድማ ምድሪ ክንደየናይ ከም እትጉዳእ ክሳብ ሕጂ ንምፍላጥ ይፍትኑ ኣለዉ፡፡"" (They are still trying to determine how big the collision was and how much the earth will be affected by it.) This clearly states that the impact on Earth is *uncertain*.

*   The passage explicitly states that researchers are trying to determine how large the collision was (""እቲ ግጭት ክንደየናይ ዓብዪ ከምዝነበረን...ንምፍላጥ ይፍትኑ ኣለዉ"").
*   Other options are not the focus of the questions the researchers are trying to figure out based on the text.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate and relevant answer based on the information provided in the text."

The passage states he was first treated at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth, and *then* transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. Option C describes the opposite order. All other options are things that happened to him according to the text.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ መግለጺታት ናይ ቻይና ቑጠባ ብግቡእ ዘይንጸባርቖ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ቻይና ካብ ናይ ሕቡራት መንግስታት ዝዓቢ ዕዳጋ ናይ መኪና ምስዳድ ኣለዋ (China has a bigger car export market than the United States)**

Here's why:

* **A: ምምሕያሻት ድሕሪ ምግባሮም ናይ ቻይና ቑጠባ ኣዝዩ ዓበየ (China's economy has grown significantly after reforms)** - This is true and directly supported by the passage stating the economy has grown 90-fold since Deng Xiaoping's reforms.
* **C: ምስ ግዜ ቻይና ካብ ናይ ሕቡራት መንግስታት ዝዓቢ GDP ክህልዋ ይኽእል እዩ (Over time, China may have a larger GDP than the United States)** -  This is also stated in the passage: ""ኣብ ውሽጢ ዕስራ ዓመታት፣ ናይ ቻይና ጃምላ ዘቤታዊ ምህርቲ (ጃ.ዘ.ም) ካብ ናይ ኣሜሪካ ክዓቢ ይኽእል እዩ (Within twenty years, China's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) may surpass that of the United States).""
* **D: ቻይና ካብ ጀርመን ንላዕሊ ማካይን ሰዲዳ ኣይትፈልጥን እያ (China has never exported more cars than Germany)** - The passage states that *last year* China exported more cars than Germany for the *first time*. This implies they hadn't done it before.

Option B is incorrect because the passage states that the United States is the *largest market* for the Chinese automotive industry, not that China exports more cars *than* the United States. In short, The USA is the biggest consumer of China's car *exports*.
"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ናይ ቻይና GDP ንናይ ሕቡራት መንግስታት መዓስ ክሓልፎ ይኽእል?,"The correct answer is **B: ኣብ ዉሽጢ ክልተ ዓሰርተ ዓመታት**

The passage states: ""ኣብ ውሽጢ ዕስራ ዓመታት፣ ናይ ቻይና ጃምላ ዘቤታዊ ምህርቲ (ጃ.ዘ.ም) ካብ ናይ ኣሜሪካ ክዓቢ ይኽእል እዩ."" This translates to ""Within twenty years, China's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) could exceed that of America."" Twenty years is equal to two decades.

The passage states that Hu encouraged developing countries ""መጀመሪያ ኣርሲሕኻ ዳሓር ምፅራግ ልምዲ ንከወግዳ"" which translates to ""to avoid the practice of polluting first and then cleaning up later."" The other options are incorrect or misinterpret the text:

*   **A:** The passage states that they shouldn't take on obligations *beyond* their development level.
*   **B:** While the first part of the passage mentions China's economic output, it is in reference to the carbon emissions target not as a directive for developing countries to focus on their economic output.
*   **C:** The passage specifically says that developing countries should *not* be asked to take on responsibilities beyond their capabilities."
ብሁ ዘይተጠቕሰ እንታይ ነበረ?,"The correct answer is **C: ናይ ካርቦን ምዝርጋሕ ክቓረጸሉ ዝትስፈዎ ዕለት (The date they expect to cut carbon emissions)**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Hu says they will try to reduce carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP compared to 2005 levels by 2020. While the text mentions that they aim to reduce emission. it does not give a specific target date for when they would completely ""cut"" it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: መሰረት ነቶም ቐይድታት (The basis for the restrictions):** The passage mentions that the reduction targets are based on China's economic output.
*   **B: ብዛዕባ ብከላ ዝምልከት ምኽሪ ንኣብ ምዕበላ ዝርከባ ሃገራት (Advice to developing countries regarding pollution):** Hu advised developing countries to avoid polluting first and then cleaning up later.
*   **D: ስእሊ ንምቑራጽ ዝርጋሐ ካርቦን (The plan to cut carbon emissions):** Although the passage does not mention an exact cut-off date for the carbon emission. the paragraph generally talks about cutting carbon emissions.

Therefore, C is the only option that was *not* mentioned by Hu in the passage."
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ነየናይ እዩ ቨርማን ኩነታት ጽቡቕ የለን ዝበለ?,"The correct answer is **B: ኣንጎላ** (Angola).

The passage states that Richard Veerman said, ""ኣንጎላ በቲ ሕማም ለበዳ ናብ ብጣዕሚ ሕማቕ ኣጋጣሚ ተምርሕ ከምዘላን እቲ ኹነታት ኣብ ኣንጎላ ኣዝዩ ሕማቕ ኮይኑ ኣሎ፡፡"" which translates to ""Angola is heading towards a very bad situation because of the epidemic, and the situation in Angola is very bad.""

The passage states that the performers encouraged the audience to smoke cannabis. This directly supports option A. The other options are not directly supported by the text provided.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Leonov's first spacewalk was the ""መጀመርታ ዝተገበረ ምርኢት መንኮራኹር ወይ ከዓ “ምንቅስቃስ ጠፈር”"". ""ምንቅስቃስ ጠፈር"" translates to ""Spacewalk"" in English.
* ""Spacewalk"" is also called ""Extravehicular Activity (EVA)"" in English.
* Therefore,  ""Extravehicular Activity"" (translated to ""ንጥፈት ኤክስትራቪሂኩላር"" in Tigrinya) is the correct answer.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A:**  Apollo-Soyuz was a mission he commanded later in his career, not the name of his spacewalk.
* **B:** ቕድድም ጠፈር  (Space Race) refers to the overall competition between the US and the Soviet Union.
* **D:** ኮስሞናት ቑ. 11 (Cosmonaut No. 11) was his designation as a cosmonaut.

ኣብቲ ግጭት መን ተጎዲኡ?,"The correct answer is **A: ጊብሶን**.

The passage states that Gibson was taken to the hospital after the accident but died shortly after. The driver of the truck was unharmed. While the children were upset, the passage does not state that they were physically hurt in the accident. The garage worker was only a witness.
"
ኣብቲ ሓደጋ ዝነበሩ ሰባት እንታይ ኣጋጢምዎም?,"The correct answer is **C: ምዉጫጭን ብኽያትን ነበረ (There was screaming and crying)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states a garage worker near the accident said ""Children waiting to be picked up were there, all crying and screaming."" This clearly indicates a state of screaming and crying.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ክልቲኦም ሞይቶም (Both died)**: The passage only explicitly states that Gibson died. The truck driver was unharmed.
*   **B: ሓደ ተጎዲኡ፡ ሓደ ሞይቱ (One was injured, one died)**: The passage states that Gibson died and the truck driver was not injured.
*   **D: ክልቲኦም መጉዳእቲ ኣጋጢምዎም (Both were injured)**: The passage states that Gibson died and the truck driver was not injured."

The passage explicitly states that the team was expecting the tidal forces (ናይ ማዕበል ሓይልታት) between the black holes of Sagittarius and the Milky Way to be the cause of the observed phenomenon.
"

The passage discusses the interaction and gravitational forces between the Sagittarius galaxy and the Milky Way galaxy. The researchers were studying the tidal forces between these two galaxies, particularly the impact of the Milky Way's gravity on the Sagittarius galaxy.
"
ኣብቲ መግለጺ ምርኩስ ብምግባር፡ በቶም ዓቐባዉያን ዘይንቐፍ ዘሎ እንታይ እዩ?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: ናይ ዳግመ ህንጸት ኮንትራት ዝወሃብ ዘሎ መን’ዩ (Who is being given the reconstruction contracts)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states, ""ዳግም ህንጸት ናይ ነጻነት ወቐሳ ዳግም ናይ ዝህነጹ ውዕላት ንነበርቲ ዋሺንግቶን ኣብ ምሃብ ዝጠመተ እዩ። (Reconstruction criticism focuses on giving reconstruction contracts to Washington residents.)"" This indicates that a key concern (and point of criticism) is who is receiving the reconstruction contracts.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: ናይ ረዲኤት ወጻኢታት (Relief spending):** While the passage mentions spending related to poverty reduction and reconstruction after the hurricane, the specific focus of the critics isn't the *amount* of aid spending itself. The contention is about who benefits from the reconstruction contracts.
*   **B: ጻዕሪ ዳግመ ህንጸት ዘይምህላዉ (Lack of reconstruction efforts):** The passage implies that reconstruction *is* happening, but the criticism is about *how* it's being done and who's benefiting.
*   **D: ወጻኢታት ናይ ዳግመ ህንጸት (Reconstruction spending):** Similar to option A, the criticism is not about the level of spending, but about who receives the contracts for that spending.
"
ነቲ ውዑላት ናይ ዳግመ ህንጸት ንጻዕርታት ሁሪኬን ካትሪና መን ይነቕፎ ኣሎ?,"The correct answer is **A: ፋይናንሳዉያን ዓቐብቲ** (Financial Conservatives).

The passage states that ""ገለ ናይ ፊስካል ተጣበቕቲ ብ ቀልዲ ኣምሲሎም """"ናይ ቡሽ ናይ ኦርሊያንስ ስምምዕ"""" እናበሉ ድማ ይጽውዑዎ"" which translates to ""some fiscal conservatives jokingly call it the 'Bush Orleans Treaty'"".  Fiscal conservatives are financial conservatives.

The last line says ""ዳግም ህንጸት ናይ ነጻነት ወቐሳ ዳግም ናይ ዝህነጹ ውዕላት ንነበርቲ ዋሺንግቶን ኣብ ምሃብ ዝጠመተ እዩ"" which translates to ""Reconstruction of liberty criticism focused on giving reconstruction contracts to Washington residents"". Therefore we can also deduce that Washington residents are getting the contracts, but they are not the ones criticizing them, therefore option D is incorrect.

The text states: ""ንጉሆ ኣብ ሰዓት 5 (ብኣቆጽራ ምብራቕ)፣ እታ መንኮራኹር ናብ ከባቢ ኣየር መሬት ክትኣትው እንከላ ኣብ **ሰሜን ካሊፎርኒያ**, ኦሪጎን፣ ኔቫዳን ኡታህም ንዝነብሩ ወገናት ቅልል ዝበለ ምርኢት ከምዝግበር ትፅቢት ይግበር.""

This clearly indicates that Northern California is the first place where the light from Stardust is expected to be visible as it enters the Earth's atmosphere.

The passage explicitly states that Stardust will break the record for the fastest spacecraft, previously held by Apollo X. The other options are not directly related to breaking a record as described in the passage.
"
ዶክተር ባላሱብራማኒያን ንሳሮጃ ባላሱብራማኒያን ብኸምይ ይዛመዳ?,"The correct answer is **B: ጓሉ (daughter)**.

The text states that ""ሓደ ዶክተር ኣዲኣ ረቡዕ ዕለት ኣብ መኪናኣ ጉንዲ ውሽጢ ሞይታ ድሕሪ ምርካባ..."" which translates to ""a doctor's mother was found dead in the trunk of a car on Wednesday...""  Since the doctor is Malar Balasubramanian and the deceased is Saroja Balasubramanian, Saroja is Malar's mother, making Malar her daughter.
"
ሰዉነት ናይ ሳራ ባላሱብራማኒያን ኣበይ ተረኺቡ?,"The correct answer is **C: ኣብ መጽዓኒ ናይ መኪና** (in the trunk of the car).

The passage states: ""ኣብኡ ድማ፣ ናይ ወዲ 53 ዓመት ሳሮጃ ባላሱብራማንያን ሬሳ ብደም ዝተኣለኹ ኣንሶላታት ተሸፊኑ ረኺቦም።"" which translates to: ""There, the body of 53-year-old Saroja Balasubramanian was found covered in blood-stained sheets."" The ""there"" refers to the black Oldsmobile Intrigue, specifically the trunk as implied by the context of finding the car.
"
ብኢበይ እንታይ ተረኺቡ?,"The correct answer is **C: ስካይፕ (Skype)**.

The passage states that eBay hoped to gain popularity in regions like China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil by acquiring Skype.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions that eBay hopes to diversify its profit sources, which directly translates to **""ኣታዊኡ ከወሃህድ"" (Diversify its revenue)**.
*   The passage also states that eBay hopes to gain popularity in regions like China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil, meaning it wants to **""ናብ ሓደስቲ ግዝኣታት ከስፋሕፍሕ"" (Expand into new territories)**."

The text explicitly states negotiators (ተላዘብቲ) tried to calm the situation and reason with the prisoners. It also mentions the arrival of riot police (ተንቲ ጎንፂ ፖሊስ). It does not say or imply that hospital staff (ሰራሕተኛታት ሆስፒታል) or police chiefs (ሓለቃ ፖላይስ) were involved. Finally, the fire brigade (ጉጅለ መጥፋእቲ ሓዊ) were only there to extinguish the fire, not negotiate.

This indicates the fire was a deliberate act by the prisoners and a key event in the escalation of the situation. The other options are not directly linked to the prisoners' actions in the provided text.

The passage states that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei refers to the country's dependence on oil since the 1979 Islamic revolution as a ""trap"" and says that the country must free itself. This clearly indicates that he wants Iran to free itself from its oil dependence.
"

The passage states that voters ""indicate their chosen candidate on a pre-printed ballot paper."" This directly answers the question.
"

The passage states that Allen was interested in the war his entire life, and that's why he started trying to find Musashi. The eight-year effort was specifically to find Musashi, fueled by his lifelong interest in the war.
"

The passage states ""ኣለን ንመብዛሕትኡ ሃፍቱ ኣብ ዳህሳስ ባሕሪ ኸም ዘዋፈረን"" which translates to ""Allen devoted most of his wealth to sea exploration"". Although he was doing it specifically to find the Musashi, the direct answer to where he spent his money is sea exploration.

**All of the above (A, B, C, and D)**

Here's why:

*   **A: ነዳዲ ዩራንዩም (Fuel Uranium):** The text explicitly states that authorities suspect barrels containing uranium fuel are leaking, which is a highly dangerous situation in a nuclear facility.

*   **B: ፈነወ-ጸርጊ ሲዝየም (Radioactive Cesium):** The Japan Nuclear Agency confirmed the presence of radioactive cesium, a known hazardous material.

*   **C: ጻዕዳ ትኪ (White Smoke):** Although it may not sound dangerous on its own, the white smoke coming from the factory is the initial indicator of the problem. The fact that the authorities are warning people to stay inside and close windows strongly suggests this is not ordinary smoke, but something potentially toxic.

*   **D: ኣዮዲን (Iodine):** Like cesium, the Japan Nuclear Agency also confirmed the presence of radioactive iodine, which is a dangerous substance."
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ድሕሪ ኣብቲ ትካል ዘጋጠመ ፍጻሜ ነቶም ናይቲ ከባቢ ተቐማጦ ካብ ዝቐረቡ ናይ ዉሕስነት ምኽርታት ዘይኮነ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"Based on the information provided, the local authorities are warning residents to stay indoors, close ventilation systems, and not drink tap water. Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: ኣሃዱታት ናይ መዝሓሊ ንፋስ ምጥቓም ክዉገዱ (Avoid using air conditioning units):** This aligns with the warning to close ventilation systems, including air conditioners.

*   **B: ኣብ ዉሽጢ ክጸንሑ (Stay indoors):** This is a direct instruction from the authorities.

*   **C: ጻዕዳ ትኪ ንዉሽጢ ምስትንፋስ ክዉገዱ (Avoid inhaling the white smoke):** While not explicitly stated, it is understood that inhalation of toxic or contaminated substances such as the white smoke should be avoided.

*   **D: ናይ ቡንባ ማይ ካብ ምስታይ ክዉገዱ (Avoid drinking tap water):** This is another direct instruction from the authorities.

Therefore, the answer is **C: ጻዕዳ ትኪ ንዉሽጢ ምስትንፋስ ክዉገዱ (Avoid inhaling the white smoke)** because it is implied in the warning instead of being a direct warning from authorities."

The passage explicitly states that Dr. Moll said the new strain is ""very worrying and frightening because it has a very high mortality rate."" While other options might be concerning aspects of XDR-TB in general, the question specifically asks what *Dr. Moll* finds most concerning based on the interview.

The passage states: ""ዶክተር ሞል ብውሕዱ እቶም ክልተ፣ ሰራሕተኛታት እቲ ሆስፒታል ከምዝነበሩ ይሓስብ፡፡"" This translates to ""Dr. Moll thinks that at least two of them were hospital staff."" So the answer is 2.

The passage explicitly states that NextGen uses ""ብሳተላይት ዝተመስረተ ቴክኖሎጂ"" which translates to ""satellite-based technology"".
"
NextGen ነቶም ተቖጻጸርቲ ናይ ኣየር ትራፊክ ብኸመይ ብቐጥታ ይኽስቦም?,"The correct answer is **B: ዝለዓለ ብሉጽ ናይ ነፈርቲ ቦታታት**.

Here's why: The passage states that NextGen allows air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft locations with greater accuracy. Therefore, **ዝለዓለ ብሉጽ ናይ ነፈርቲ ቦታታት** (Higher precise location of aircrafts) directly benefits the controllers.
"

The text states that historians criticized the FBI for focusing on easily solvable cases, like stolen cars, to *increase their success rate*. Therefore, the goal of increasing their success rate is the reason for the criticism, not something they *didn't* criticize them for.  The other options are all mentioned as part of the criticism."

While the passage discusses criticisms of the FBI focusing on easy cases like stolen cars, the question specifically asks what the ""ጽዩፍ ዉጥን"" (indecent plan/initiative) forced the FBI to do. The passage states that the initiative required the FBI to dedicate 10 agents to major pornography cases. Therefore, the answer must be about pornography.

The passage states that Brzezinski diplomatically assisted Carter during the Iranian hostage crisis (which was a result of the Iranian Revolution).
"
ክሳብ 1977 ጽፍሒ ናይ ሃገራዊ ኣማኻሪ ዉሕስነት መን ሒዝዎ ነይሩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ክሲንገር (Kissinger)**.

The passage states that Brzezinski replaced Henry Kissinger as National Security Advisor in 1977.

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ናይ ቦብክ ስራሕ ምስ ፓርቲዝያን በልግሬድ ብልክዕ ዘይገልጹ ኣየኖት እዮም?,"The correct answer is **A: ነታ ጉጅለ ይጻወተላ ኣብ ዝነበረ ልዕሊ 468 ሸቶታት ኣመዝጊቡ** (He scored more than 468 goals while playing for the team).

Here's why:

*   The passage states he scored 403 goals in 468 appearances, not *more* than 468 goals. The other options are directly supported by the passage."
ብዛዕባ ታሪኽ ናይ ቦብክ ምስ ፓርቲዝያን በልግሬድ ቕኑዕ ዝኾነ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ንፓርቲዝያን ኣብ 1945 ክጻወት ጀሚሩ**.

The passage states: ""ንሱ ኣብ 1945 ተጸንቢርዎም..."". This translates to ""He joined them in 1945..."" which means he started playing for Partizan in 1945.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ነቲ ሄስፐሮቹስ ካብቲ ቬሎክሪፕቶር ዝፈላልዮ ገጸ-ባህሪ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ዝዓበየ ካልኣይ ጽፍሪ ኣለዎ**.

The passage states: ""እቲ ኻልኣይ ጽፍሩ ዝዓበየ ስለዝነበረ ሄሰፐረንይከስ ዝብላ ስም ተዋሂብዎ ትርጉሙ ድማ “ምዕራባዊ ጽፍሪ” እዩ.""  This clearly indicates that the larger second claw is a defining characteristic of *Hesperonychus*, differentiating it. The passage already stated that it's a relative of velociraptor and part of the Dromaeosauridae family. The other characteristics (bipedal, feathered, warm-blooded) are implied to be shared within that family or group.
"

The passage states that the name *Hesperonychus* was given because of its enlarged second claw and that the name translates to ""western claw"". Therefore, the name comes from a physical characteristic of the animal: its **claw**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states that the couple was celebrating their first wedding anniversary in Buffalo with family and friends.
*   The shooting occurred in Buffalo, where the anniversary celebration took place.
*   The text mentions the marriage took place in Texas, but the celebration and shooting occurred in Buffalo.
*   The text doesn't indicate that the shooting occurred at the wedding or an official jubilee event."

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the workers initially feared the pipeline would leak. This fear of fuel spillage (ምድፋእ ነዳዲ) was their primary concern.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: ናይ ዱኽዒ ካርጎ ዘይምህላዉ (Lack of Fertilizer Cargo):** While the ship was headed to pick up fertilizer, this was not the initial concern of the crew related to the incident itself.
* **B: ማዕበላትን ልዑል ንፋሳትን (Waves and High Winds):** These were the cause of the accident, not the initial concern.
* **D: ንኣባላት ሰራሕተኛታት ከጋጥሞም ዝኽእል ሓደጋታት (Potential Dangers to Crew Members):** While a valid concern in a general sense, the text specifically points to the *initial* fear regarding the leaking of fuel."
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ መግለጺታት ብዛዕባ ዕንወት ሉኖ ሓቒ ዘይኮነ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: እታ መርከብ ኣብ ግዜ ናይቲ ዕንወት 100 ሜተር ናይ ነዳዲ ኣብ ደገ ነበራ**

Here's why:

*   The text states the vessel was 100 meters long, not that it had 100 meters of fuel outside it. Therefore this statement is factually incorrect based on the given text.

Let's examine the other options to see why they are plausible:

*   **A: እቲ ዕንወት ቅድሚ ምልዓል ናይቲ ካርጎ ኣጋጢሙ:** The text explicitly states ""እታ 100 ሜተር ዝንውሓታ መርከብ ነቲ ልሙድ ድኹዒ ጽዕነታ ንምልዓል ትጐዓዝ ነበረት"" This implies the ship was in the process of loading cargo. This means that the event happened before the cargo was loaded.
*   **C: ካብ ዓሰርተ ክልተ ኣባላት ሰራሕተኛታት፡ ሓደ መጉዳእቲ ወሪድዎ:** The text states ""እቲ ዝነበረ ጉድኣት ናይ ኣፍንጫ ስብራት ጥራሕ ነይሩ"" This tells us that one of the twelve members of staff suffered from an injury.
*   **D: እታ መርከብ ናብቲ መዕገቲ ማይ ተደፊኣ:** The text says ""እቲ ሉኖ እንትቕደድን ከቢድ ንፋስን ማዕበልን ናብቲ ዝፈስስ ማይ እንትኣቲዎ"" which means that the incident happened in the open sea due to strong winds and waves. The ship was pushed into the water because of the heavy winds and waves, in this situation, it would be considered that the ship was ""pushed"" into the water."
ኣልጀርያ ኣበየና ክፍለ ዘመን ናጽነታ ረኺባ?,"The correct answer is **C: 1960ታት**. The passage states that he returned to Algeria ""by the 1960s"" after it declared its independence.

The passage states that because so many people came to Rome, they *could not* get into the funeral at St. Peter's Square. This implies that the large crowds couldn't see the ceremony *there* (in St. Peter's Square), hence the need for the large screens in other parts of Rome.
"
እቲ ናይ ቐብሪ ስነ-ስርዓት ኣበይ ተኻይዱ?,"The correct answer is **C: ኣብ ቐጽሪ ናይ ሰይንት ፒተር (ኣብ ቐጽሪ ናይ ሰይንት ፒተር)**.

The passage states ""ናብቲ ኣብ ቅዱስ ጰጥሮስ ኣደባባይ ዝነበረ ቀብሪ ክኣትዉ ኣይከኣሉን,"" which translates to ""they could not enter the funeral that was in Saint Peter's Square."" This indicates the funeral itself was held in Saint Peter's Square. The other locations were for viewing the event on large screens.
"

The text states that no major injuries were reported. While 5 people showed signs of shock and received medical attention, that is not considered a ""heavy injury"" as asked in the question.
"
ነቲ ናይ ጋዝ ምልሓኹ መን ሓበሬታ ሂቡ?,"The correct answer is **A: ኣብቲ ህንጻ ዝነበረ ጎረቤት** (A: A neighbor who lived in the building)

The passage states: ""ሓደ ጐረቤቱ ብዛዕባ ዘልሕዅ ጋዝ ምስ ጸውዐ ናብቲ ቦታ ጸብጻብ ኣቕረበ"" which translates to ""A neighbor reported to the location after calling about the leaking gas.""
"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ክንደይ ዝኣኽሉ ሰባት ኣብቲ መጥቓዕቲ ሞይቶም?,"Let's analyze the text provided:

*   It mentions two people who ""had an accident"": 25-year-old Nicholas Alden and 21-year-old Zachary Cuddeback.
*   Edgar Vegilla suffered injuries.
*   Christopher Schneider suffered serious injuries, including the loss of an eye.

The text does **not** say that anyone died. It only discusses injuries.

Therefore, the correct answer is that none of the people mentioned in the text died in the attack.

Since none of the options provided correspond to a zero death toll, we must consider whether the text has been misinterpreted. The text does not state that anyone had died, it only states that Nicholas Alden and Zachary Cuddeback ""had an accident"". However, the text then goes on to discuss Edgar Vegilla and Christopher Schneider who were obviously injured severely. It's possible the text meant Alden and Cuddeback were also severly injured.

With the possibility they were severely injured, we should note that two people were mentioned in the first sentence, meaning there were possibly two fatalities. Therefore, let's reconsider the answers.

**Revised Answer:**

*   **B: 2**

**Explanation:**

The text mentions Nicholas Alden and Zachary Cuddeback as those involved in the initial incident. Although the text does not directly state that they died, there is nothing else to say that they didn't die. The text then goes onto describe the injuries of Edgar Vegilla and Christopher Schneider, who are therefore likely not included in the death toll."
ኣብቲ ናይ መጥቓዕቲ እዋን ኣብ ገለ እዋን ምቱካስ ዝኣበየት ብረት ናይ መን ነበረት?,"The correct answer is **B: ዩካ (Uka)**.

The passage states: ""መሳርያ ኡካ ናብ ርእሲ ሓደ ሓምሻይ ሰብኣይ እናመላኸተ ኸሎ ፈሸለ"" which translates to ""Uka's weapon failed while aiming at the head of a fifth man."" This clearly indicates the weapon that misfired belonged to Uka.
"
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ስፖርትታት ካብ መደብ ኦሎምፒክ ዝወጸ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ቤዝቦል (Baseball)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""ኣብ 2005 ካብ ጸወታታት ኦሎምፒክ ንኽወጹ ዝተወሰነሎም ጸወታታት ስኳሽ፣ ካራቴ፣ ሮለር ስፖርት፣ ቤዝ ቦልን ሶፍት ቦልን ናብ መደባት ኦሎምፒክ ንኽኣትዉ ፈተነ ተገይሩ (In 2005, squash, karate, roller sports, baseball and softball, which were decided to be excluded from the Olympic Games, attempted to enter the Olympic program.)"" This indicates that baseball was removed from the Olympic program at some point, along with the other sports listed.
*   The passage explicitly states that rugby is returning to the Olympics, meaning it wasn't already part of the program.
*   Squash and Karate are listed as sports that attempted to enter the Olympic program, implying they were not already part of it, therefore they couldn't be *removed* from it."
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ስፖርትታት እቶም ኣህጉራዊ ናይ ኦሎምፒክ ኮሚተታት ናብ ግጥማት ንኽጽንር ድምጺ ዝሃቡ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ሕብረት ራግቢ (Rugby Union)**.

The passage states that ""ራግቢ ፣ ብፍላይ ናይ ራግቢ ሕብረት (Rugby, specifically Rugby Union)... ተመሪጾም (were chosen).""

The passage states that Arthur Guinness signed a lease for **9000 years**.
"
ጊነስ ኣብ ነፍሲ ወከፍ ዓመት ክንደይ ዝኣክል ቢልዮን ዶላራት የእቱ?,"The correct answer is **C: 14**

The passage states that Guinness has an annual revenue of over 10 billion euros (14.7 billion US dollars). So, it is approximately 14 billion dollars.
"

The passage states: ""ፈረንሳ ካብ ኦስትሪያ፡ ጀርመን፡ ስሎቬንያ፡ ቡልጋሪያ፡ ግሪክን ጣልያንን ቀጺላ በዚ ቫይረስ እዚ ዝተጠቕዐት ሻውዐይቲ ሀገር ኣባል ናይ ኣውሮፓ ሕብረት ኮይና ኣላ"" which translates to: ""France, after Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece and Italy, is the seventh member state of the European Union affected by this virus.""
"

The passage states that the cholera outbreak is believed to have originated near the UN peacekeepers' camp and that the UN waste was not properly disposed of, leading to bacteria entering the Artibonite River.
"
እቲ ናይ ኣይሪሽ መንግስቲ እንታይ ክገብር እዩ መደብ ዘለዎ?,"The best answer is **D: ሓሽሻት ገበን ምዃኖም ከቛርጾም (ሓሽሻት ገበን ምዃኖም ከቛርጾም)** (End the criminalization of drugs).

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses pressure to *change* the existing situation quickly.** The government spokesperson says it's important to *quickly decide on the law* from a public health and criminal justice perspective.
* **The Minister of Health is concerned about the safety of people using the substance and about drug-related crime since the changes began.** This implies the current laws are leading to unintended consequences.
* **The urgency and concerns raised suggest a move *away* from strict prohibition.**

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: ንናይ ሓሽሽ ገበነኛታት ፍርዲ ክህብ (To sentence drug criminals):** While this is a potential outcome of existing laws, the passage focuses on changing the laws, not simply enforcing them more harshly.
* **B: ኣብ ተፈቓድነት ናይ ሓሽሽ ኣዝዮም ተረርቲ ዝኾኑ ሕግታት ከተኣታቱ (To introduce very strict laws on the permissibility of hashish):** The passage emphasizes a quick decision on the law due to public health and criminal justice concerns which indicates they are likely trying to relax the laws.
* **C: ኣብ ተፈቓድነት ናይ ሓሽሻት ሕግታት ከፍኹሶም (To loosen the laws on the permissibility of hashish):** While this is a possibility, ""ሓሽሻት ገበን ምዃኖም ከቛርጾም"" (End the criminalization of drugs) is the best answer because it is the most complete.
"
ኣብ ኣይርላንድ ንግዚኡ ሕጋዊ ዝኾነ እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **D: ሓሽሻት (Hashish/Drugs)**.

The passage states: ""...ውልቀ-ሰባት ንግዜኡ ሕጋውነት ናይቲ ንጥረ-ነገራት ዝጥቀሙ..."" which translates to ""...individuals using the temporary legality of the substance..."" and ""...ምስ ሓሽሽ ዝተተሓሓዘ ገበን..."" which translates to ""...crimes related to hashish/drugs..."" This clearly indicates that the substance that is temporarily legal is drugs.
"
ዝተጠርጠር ገበነኛ ንምንታይ እዩ ዝጻረ?,"The correct answer is **D: ስርቒ (Stealing)**.

The passage clearly states that the suspect is being sought for robbery, which translates to stealing.

The passage states that the sign was *not* vandalized, but rather altered with paint. So it wasn't physically destroyed. The other answers (A, B, and D) are directly related to the changes that were made.

*   **C: ፍቓድ መወዓውዒታት ምሕታም (Printing advertisements without permission):** The text says he was accused of putting up large advertisements on buses without permission.
*   **D: ኣብ ክፍሊ ርኹስ ቛንቛ ምጥቓም (Using foul language in class):** The text mentions that he used irregular language in class, and a former student described his teaching methods as being like a 'friend'.

The only one he was *not* explicitly accused of, according to the text, is dating a student or having inappropriate relationships with his students."

The other options are incorrect because:

*   A: ገያሾ (Travelers): The text states that Hong Kong tourists were taken hostage (""ናይ ሆንግኮንግ ቱሪስታት ኣውቶቡሶም ... ብምምንጣል ጨውዩዎም ኣሎ"").

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ድሕሪ ሓሙሽተ ደቒቓ ምርኢት እቲ ንፋስ ምንፋስ ጀሚሩ (Five minutes after the show, the wind started to blow), ድሕሪ ሓደ ደቒቓ እቲ ንፋስ ብ70ኪ.ሜ ምንፋስ ጀሚሩ… (after a minute the wind started blowing at 70km).""  This clearly indicates that strong winds occurred *before* the rain and hail.

The text states that Fred is the ""ሳልሳይ ዋና ኣውሎ ንፋስ ብቻ እዩ"" which translates to ""the third major hurricane"" east of 35°W. Therefore, there must have been two hurricanes before Fred.

The passage states that ""the 802.11n standard's speed is significantly higher than its predecessors with a theoretical maximum throughput of 600mbit/s.""  This directly answers the question.
"
ነቲ 802.11n ብድሕሪት ምስ 802.11b ተወዳደሪ ንምዃን እንታይ የገድሶ?,"The correct answer is **D: ክልተ ራድዮታት (Two radios)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...እቲ ናይ ምድሪ ጣብያ ክልተ ራድዮታት እንተለዉ እዚ ካብ 802.11a ፣ 802.11b ከምኡውን 802.11g ብሓንሳብ ንድሕሪት ስኒት ክኸውን ኣኽኣለ (If the ground station has two radios, this makes it possible to be compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g simultaneously).""

This clearly indicates that having two radios is the key factor for backward compatibility with older standards like 802.11b. The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: ክእለት ናይ 802.11b ኣብ 5.0Ghz ክትዓዩ (Ability of 802.11b to work on 5.0Ghz):** 802.11b doesn't operate at 5.0 GHz. 802.11n is backwards compatible to older technologies that would not have that function.
*   **C: ዉጺኢት ናይ 600ሜጋባይት/ካ (Output of 600 megabytes/ca):** This refers to 802.11n's maximum speed, not the reason for backward compatibility.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions the government has promised to supply millions of doses of mock encephalitis vaccines.
*   The vaccines are intended for areas that have been historically most affected by the disease.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **ጸረ-ባልዕ (Anti-predator):** While the disease is carried by pigs and transmitted by mites, an anti-predator system doesn't fit the measures the government is doing.
*   **መትሓዚ ሓሸማ (Pig culling):** The passage mentions pig culling as a measure being taken, however it is not likely to be implemented to end the disease.

*   **C: ሓደስቲ ነፈርቲ ምግዛእ ዝኽልክል እገዳ (Sanctions preventing the purchase of new aircraft)**: This is directly stated as well.

While the passage implies financial difficulties due to sanctions preventing new purchases, it doesn't explicitly mention a lack of money preventing the purchase of new aircraft.

The passage focuses on the aging fleet and the inability to acquire new planes due to sanctions, but it does not mention poor maintenance of the flight crew as a cause of the accidents. Therefore, that is the answer that doesn't fit."

Here's why:

*   **A: ምንቓፍ ናይ ህሉዉ ፖሊሲ** (Criticism of the current policy): The passage explicitly states, ""እቲ ጸብጻብ ንኩሉ ገጻት ናይ'ቲ ንዒራቕ ዝምልከት እዋናዊ ፖሊሲ ተግባር ብጣዕሚ ዝነቅፍ"" (The report is highly critical of all aspects of the current policy regarding Iraq).

*   **D: ምሕጽንታ ንናይ ኣሜሪካ ስምምዕ** (Advocacy for American agreements): The passage mentions, ""አሜሪካ ንርሑቕ ምብራቕ ብዛዕባ ዘውፀኣቶ ፖሊሲ ኣተረጓግማ ስምምዕነት ንፍፀም ይዕድም"" (It calls for open debate and for America to implement an interpretation agreement on its policy toward the Far East). This suggests advocacy for American agreements and their implementation.

It does NOT suggest that minor changes would be sufficient to stop the violence. It rather implies that significant changes are needed."

Here's why:

* **B: ቐጥታዊ ምቕያር ናይ ኣንፈት (Direct change of direction)**: The passage explicitly states the report encourages ""ቅጽበታዊ ለውጢ ናይ ኣንፈት (immediate change of direction).""
* **C: ምጥቓም ክፉት ክትዕ (Using open discussion)**: The passage mentions that the report calls for ""ክፍቲ ክርክር ንኽግበር (open debate).""

Option A, ""To declare a decree to stop the increasing violence,"" is not explicitly mentioned as a recommendation in the provided text.  While the report warns about the increasing violence, it doesn't specifically call for a formal decree as a solution.

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ሓደ ካብቲ ናይ ሂቶሺ ሳቶ ክብርታት ዘይኮነ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"Let's analyze the provided information to determine which statement is NOT a merit of Hitoshi Saito:

*   **P (Premise):** The premise states that Hitoshi Saito was a two-time Olympic gold medalist, died of intrahepatic bile duct cancer at 54, and was the chairman of the All Japan Judo Federation training committee at the time of his death. It also says he was a former Olympic and world champion.

Let's assess the options:

*   **A: ናይ ክልተ ዙር ናይ ዓለም ጎብለል (Two-time World Champion):** The premise states he was a former world champion, but doesn't specify two times. However, the premise refers to his other medals earned. So we cannot conclude he earned *exactly* two world champion medals.
*   **B: ንኹሉ ናይ ጃፓን ጁዶ ፈደሬሽን ናይ ኮሚተ ኣቦ ወንበር (Chairman of the All Japan Judo Federation training committee):** This is explicitly stated in the premise.
*   **C: ናይ ክልተ ዙር ናይ ኦለምፒክ ተዓዋቲ ወርቒ ሜዳልያ (Two-time Olympic gold medalist):** This is explicitly stated in the premise.
*   **D: ክኢላ ጁዶ (Skilled Judo):** While not explicitly stated, the fact that he was an Olympic and World champion and held a high position in the Judo Federation implies he was a skilled Judoka.

Considering the available information, option A is least supported by the information in premise P. The passage does not specify that Saito was a two-time world champion, although it does state he was a world champion.

**Therefore, the correct answer is A.**
"
ኢዋሳኪ ማሕላ ካብ ምዉሳድ ኣበይ ከወግድ ክኢሉ?,"The correct answer is **B: ኔፓል**

The passage states that Iwasaki escaped from a wedding in Nepal. This implies that he avoided taking a vow (marriage vows) in Nepal.
"
ንኢዋሳኪ መን ኣጥቒዕዎ?,"The correct answer is **B: ሸፋቱ ባሕሪ** (Sea pirates).

The passage states ""ብናይ ባሕሪ ሰረቕቲ ተሰሪቑ"" which translates to ""He was robbed by sea pirates"".
"
ኣሎንሶ ቕድድሙ መዓስ ዛዚሙ?,"The correct answer is **D: ቅድሚ ምምርሑ (Before leading)**

The passage states that Alonso led most of the race but ended it after a pit stop. This means he ended his race *before* he could lead to the end of the race.
"
ሽሁማቸር ቕድድሙ ቐልጢፉ ንኽዝም ዝገበሮ እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **D: ዕንወት ናይታ መኪና ሞላ**.

The passage states that Michael Schumacher ended his race soon after Alonso due to damage sustained in battles during the race. This implies a mechanical issue with the car itself, which is best described as ""ዕንወት ናይታ መኪና ሞላ"" (damage to the car). The other options are not directly supported by the text.

The passage states ""እቶም ኮምሽነር ናይ ዋሕስ መሰል ፈቂዶም ኣለዉ"" which translates to ""The Commissioners have approved the right to bail."" Therefore, the Commissioners (ኣባል ሽማግለ) are responsible for approving bail.

Here's why:

* The passage states that those detained for over 24 hours in April *were not heard by the judicial commission* (ፍርድቤት ኮሚሽን መጋባያ ዘይተሰምዐሎም).  Judge Glenn issued a *temporary order* (ግዚያዊ ትእዛዝ) for their release *because* they hadn't been presented with charges before the commission. This implies that the issue was the lack of formal charges being presented to the court. The passage also implies that the commissioner will approve bail.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: ዋሕስ (Bail)**: While bail is mentioned later in the passage, it's not the direct reason for the temporary order. The order was for release *because* charges were not presented to the court after being detained for over 24 hours.
* **B: ምስቲ ዝኣሰሮም ሓለቃ ፖሊስ ኣኼባ (Meeting with the arresting police chief)**: The passage doesn't mention this as a requirement for remaining detained over 24 hours.
* **D: ፍርዲ (Verdict)**: This would only occur after the court proceedings had already been taken care of and would be much longer than the 24 hour time period.

The passage mentions:

*   Saving Afghans from losses and security problems related to another election. (This covers A: ሓደጋታት ጸጥታ / Security risks)
*   Authorities decided to cancel the election. Diplomats found something in the Afghan constitution that suggests the election isn't necessary. This contradicts reports that cancelling the election is unconstitutional. (This covers B: ምስ ሕገ መንግስቲ ዝጋጮ ምዃኑ / Conflict with the constitution and D: ሕገ መንግስታዊ ዘይንጹርነት / Constitutional ambiguity)

High costs (C) is not mentioned as a reason for canceling the election."

**C: ኣብ ሕገ መንግስቲ ዘይንጹርነት ነይሩ (There was ambiguity in the constitution)**

Therefore, the correct answer is **C**.
"
ንፋታ ፍርዳዊ ኣገልግሎት ዝህብ መን እዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ወኪላት ፖለቲካ (Political Agents)**

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: መንግስቲ ፓኪስታን (Government of Pakistan):** While the agents act on behalf of the government, they are the direct providers of the service.
* **C: ፕረዚደንት ፓኪስታን (President of Pakistan):** The President appoints the agents, but they do not directly provide the judicial service.
* **D: መንግስቲ እንግሊዝ (Government of England):** Pakistan gained independence in 1947, so the British government is not involved in this.

Here's why:

* **P states:** Political Agents are chosen by the President and are responsible for providing services relying on Article 247. It doesn't specifically state they provide judicial services. It states they govern and are responsible for ""governmental and judicial bodies,"" implying they oversee these bodies, not directly provide judicial services themselves.

Let's look at the other options:

* **B: ብፕረዚደንት ፓኪስታን ዝተመርጹ እዮም (They are chosen by the President of Pakistan):** This is explicitly stated in P.
* **C: ንሕገ መንግስቲ ፓኪስታን ይኽተሉ (They follow the constitution of Pakistan):** It is assumed, since P implies the authority is given by the constitution.
* **D: ኣብ ዝተወሰነ ከባቢታት ምሉእ ቁጽጽር ኣለዎም (They have full control in certain areas):** This is explicitly stated in P (""full governing control"").

Therefore, option A is the *only* statement not directly supported by the information given and thus is the false statement."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage states that the 1st and 2nd units at the Shika nuclear power plant were shut down.
*   **B:** The passage states that Noto Airport in Ishikawa Prefecture was closed.
*   **C:** The passage states that train service was suspended in the affected areas."
ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣየናይ እዩ ብሰንኪ ምንቅጥቃጥ ምድሪ ጉድኣት ዝበጽሖ?,"The correct answer is **all of the above**. The passage states that:

*   **B: ኣብ ፋብሪካ ሺካ ክልተ ሪኣክተራት (Two reactors at the Shika plant)**: The Shika nuclear power plant's units 1 and 2 were shut down. While ""shut down"" isn't necessarily ""damage"", it's an operational disruption due to the earthquake, therefore is affected.
*   **C: ገለ ጽርግያታት (Some roads)**: Some roads were damaged.
*   **D: መዓርፎ ነፈርቲ ኖቶ (Noto Airport)**: Noto Airport in Ishikawa Prefecture was closed.

Since the question is asking which ones were damaged, and all options were either damaged or affected operationally, the answer should include all of them. However, since we can only choose one answer, we need to choose the one that's explicitly stated to be ""damaged"". Therefore:

**C: ገለ ጽርግያታት** is the BEST answer because the passage explicitly says ""ገለ ጽርግያታት ተሃስዮም ኣለው"" (some roads were damaged). While the other options were also affected by the earthquake, the passage doesn't explicitly state they were ""damaged"" in the same way as the roads."

Here's why:

*   **P states:** Israel wants a continuous 10-year military presence, however the PA wants it to be for five years.
*   **A** is correct because Palestine is asking for the borders before the 1967 war.
*   **C** is correct because The agreement addresses the future of Jerusalem.
*   **D** is correct because PA wants a 5-year military presence.
Therefore, Palestine never requested a *permanent* military presence."

This translates to: ""Hamlin was in third place, twenty points behind, but at that time he was five points ahead of Bowyer.""
If Hamlin was in the 3rd position, and 5 points ahead of Bowyer, then it implies Bowyer was in 4th place.

The other options are incorrect based on the text:

*   **A:** The meteor shower mentioned happened in August, not July.
*   **B:** 24,000 is the approximate number of all meteorites found on Earth, not just those from Mars.

* **19 of the injured were police officers.** The text states ""ኣሰርተ ትሽዓተ ካብ'ቶም ዝተጎድኡ ፖሊስ እዮም ነይሮም"" meaning ""nineteen of those injured were police.""

The question asks: **""How many of the people who died in the attack were *not* police officers?""**

Since *both* of the people who died were police officers, the answer is **0**.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 0**.
"

*   **B: 45 ተቐዳደምቲ ስኪየር ኣብ ውድድር ጃይንት ስላሎም ጉያኦም ኣይወድኡን** - The text states, ""45 from a total of 117 skiers failed to qualify into ranking in Giant Slalom"". This means 45 skiers failed to finish the Giant Slalom race and were not given a rank. So, this is correct.

*   **C: ካብ ስላሎም ንላዕሊ ንጃይንት ስላሎም ዝዛዘሙ ተቐዳደምቲ ስኪየር ዝበዝሑ እዮም** - In Slalom, 116 - 36 = 80 skiers finished. In Giant Slalom, 117 - 45 = 72 skiers finished. Therefore, more skiers finished Slalom than Giant Slalom, making this statement false.

The passage states that the assassins were properly monitored, investigated, and controlled by the rangers. It also mentions the involvement of various organizations and the training received by the shooters. Therefore, the idea that the plan wasn't reviewed because it was the first attempt contradicts the passage's emphasis on oversight and preparation. The rest of the answers are facts mentioned in the passage."

The passage says a *later* report indicated it returned to Urumqi after an emergency landing, headed towards Afghanistan. Therefore, the latest report from Xinhua *didn't* initially say that the plane landed in Urumqi. It was the later report that specified the landing in Urumqi."

* **P (The passage):** Mentions Xinhua (Chinese news agency) reported a plane hijacking. The plane was threatened with a bomb and forced to return to Afghanistan, landing in Kandahar. Later reports said the plane made an emergency landing in Urumqi before returning towards Afghanistan.

* **Q (The question):** What was NOT stated in Xinhua's *first* report?

Now let's look at the options:

*   **A: እታ ነፋሪት ተጨውየት (The plane was hijacked):** The passage states the *first* report mentioned a hijacking. So, this *was* stated.

*   **B: እታ ነፋሪት ብህጹጽ ክትዓልብ ከም ዘይትኽእል ተኸልኪላ (The plane was prevented from making an emergency landing):** The first report doesn't explicitly say the plane was *prevented* from making an emergency landing. It says the plane was hijacked, threatened with a bomb, and forced to return to Afghanistan and land in Kandahar. A later report mentions the Urumqi emergency landing.

*   **C: እታ ነፋሪት ናብ ኣፍጋኒስታን ተሰጋጊራ (The plane was diverted to Afghanistan):** The first report says the plane was forced to *return* to Afghanistan. So, this *was* stated.

*   **D: እታ ነፋሪት ናይ ቦምባ ምፍርራሕ በጺሕዋ (The plane received a bomb threat):** The first report says the plane was threatened with a bomb. So, this *was* stated.

Option B is the only one that wasn't explicitly mentioned in the first report. While the hijacking and bomb threat *implied* potential difficulty landing, the explicit statement of the plane being *prevented* from landing wasn't there.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B**.

The passage states that Sarah Danius said the committee has stopped trying to reach Bob Dylan directly. Although they initially tried to contact him, they are no longer actively pursuing direct contact after getting a response from a close associate.
"
ክርከብ ዘይተከኣለ መን እዩ?,"The correct answer is **D: ቦብ ዲላን** (Bob Dylan).

The passage states that the committee couldn't directly reach Bob Dylan to inform him about winning the Nobel Prize and eventually gave up trying.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions ""እቶም ናይ ብርሚል መናፈስቲ ምናልባት ኣብ ውሽጢ እቲ በርሚል ብዝነበረ ምግፋሕ ሙቐት ሕጂውን የልሑኹ ነይሮም (Itoom nai birimil menafesti minalibat abi wishitti iti birimil bizi nebere migifafih muqetat hijiwiun yelihukhu neyirum - The barrels vents were likely still open due to thermal expansion inside the barrel)"". This suggests that thermal expansion within the barrels is contributing to the continued release or venting of fluids.

The text states ""ናይንዝ ዋርድ ኣብ እዋን ህቦብላ ካትሪና ክሳብ 20 ጫማ ዝበፅሕ ማዕበል ዝሃረማ"" which translates to ""Ninth Ward was hit by waves of up to 20 feet during Hurricane Katrina.""

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that ""ናይንዝ ዋርድ ኣብ እዋን ህቦብላ ካትሪና ክሳብ 20 ጫማ ዝበፅሕ ማዕበል ዝሃረማ"".  This directly answers the question of what happened in the Ninth Ward during Hurricane Katrina.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A:** While the passage mentions water flowing across a 100-foot section, that refers to the *current* overflow, not the Katrina flood in the Ninth Ward.
* **B:** The passage does not state the water level was up to the waist.
* **D:** While the passage mentions 6 inches of rain being enough to damage compromised dams, it does not say the specific dam in the passage broke because of 6 inches of rain.

Here's why:

* **P** states that Hamilton confirmed:
    * Howard University Hospital received the patient in good condition.
    * The patient traveled to areas in Nigeria where the Ebola virus was present.
    * The hospital is using protocols for infection control and isolation.

* **A** is incorrect because Hamilton confirmed where the patient traveled.
* **C** is incorrect because the passage discusses the hospital's *existing* protocol, not whether a protocol was followed.
* **D** is incorrect because Hamilton confirmed the patient's condition upon arrival at the hospital.

**B** is the only option not directly addressed or implied in the information Hamilton confirmed. The potential infection of *another* patient is not mentioned."

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Felicia was once a Category 4 hurricane, but weakened to a tropical depression *before* dissipating. This means it was a Category 4 hurricane *before* it was a tropical depression. Option B says it was a tropical depression *before* becoming a Category 4, which is incorrect.

*   **C: ኣብ ፈተነ ፓልም ከም መቆጻጸሪ ኮይኑ ኣገልጊሉ:** The passage says ""ኣብ'ቲ PALM መጽናዕታዊ ፈተነ፣ Zmapp ከም መተሓላለዊ ኣገልጊሉ..."" (In the PALM study, Zmapp served as a control)
*   **D: መጽናዕትታት ከም ዘመልክትዎ፡ ረብሓታቱ ካብቲ ኣብ መጀመርታ ዝሕሰብ ዝነበረ ዝወሓደ እዩ:** The passage says ""...ዳሓር ግን ስሩዕ መጽናዕቲ ከም ዝሓበሮ፣ ኣብ ምክልኻል ሞት ካብቲ ዝተሓሰቦ ንታሕቲ ትሑት ዝኾነ ረብሓ ከምዘለዎ ኣመላኺቱ፡፡"" (Later, however, a systematic study revealed that it had less benefit in preventing death than expected.)"
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ መግለጺታት ኣየናይ እዩ ንፈተነ ፓልም ብልክዕ ዝገልጽ?,"The correct answer is **C: ዜድማፕ ከም መበገሲ ናይ’ቲ ፈተነ ኣብ ጥቅም ውዒሉ**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""ኣብ'ቲ PALM መጽናዕታዊ ፈተነ፣ Zmapp ከም መተሓላለዊ ኣገልጊሉ..."". This translates to ""In the PALM study trial, Zmapp served as a comparator..."" and further explains it as a starting point for comparison. This aligns perfectly with option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   A: The passage states Zmapp had *lower* benefit than initially hoped, not higher.
*   B: While the study compared Zmapp to other treatments, it wasn't just any ""controlled medicine,"" but specifically Zmapp was used as the *comparator* drug. Also, the wording implies Zmapp was one of the three treatments it was compared against, which is incorrect.
*   D: The passage clearly states that there is *no* established treatment for the disease.

Therefore, only option C accurately reflects information presented in the passage."
ተመራመርቲ እቲ ሓድሽ ቺፕ ልዕሊ ዅሉ ኣገዳስነት ዘለዎ ኣበይ እዩ ዝመስሎም?,"The correct answer is **A: ትሑት እቶት ዘለወን ሃገራት (ትሑት ኣታዊ ዘለወን ሀገራት)**.

The passage explicitly states that the researchers believe the new chip will be most useful for patients in low-income countries to detect diseases like cancer, tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria early on.
"
ነቲ ናይ መርመራ መሳርሒ ንምህናጽ እንታይ ዓይነት ሜላ እዩ ኣብ ጥቕሚ ዝውዕል?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: ስታንዳርድ ኢንክጀት ፕሪንተር** and **C: ፕሪንት ክግበሩ ዝኽእሉ ቺፕስ**.

The text explicitly states the device ""ክምረት ዝኽእል ደቒቕ ቕራፍ ብስታንዳርድ ኢንክጀት ፕሪንተር"" - which means it is assembled using a standard inkjet printer and tiny printable chips.

Therefore, both B and C contribute to the method used to construct the diagnostic tool.
"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ብዛዕባ ሎባተ ስካርፕስ ኣየናይ ኣበሃህላ እዩ ሓቂ ዘይኰነ?,"The correct answer is **D: መብዛሕትኦም ኣብ ገጽ ወርሒ ኣይተረኽቡን** (Most of them were not found on the surface of the moon).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""እዞም ቁርጽራጻት ኣብ ወርሒ ኩሉ ዝተረኽቡ..."" (These scarps were found all over the moon...). This directly contradicts option D.
* **A is true:** The passage says ""እዚ ዝሰርሖም ናይ ጂኦሎጂ ፍጻመታት ብቐረባ ጊዜ ዝነበሩ ምዃኖም የመላኽት።"" (This indicates that the geological events that created them occurred recently).
* **B is true:** The passage says ""እዚ ኽልሰ - ሓሳብ እዚ ምስቲ ወርሒ ምሉእ ብምሉእ ጂኦሎጅያዊ ንጥፈታት ዘይብላ እያ ዝብል ሓሳብ ዝጋጮ እዩ"" (This hypothesis contradicts the idea that the moon is completely geologically inactive).
* **C is true:** The passage says ""ናይዚ ምክንያት ክዓ ወርሒ ቀስ እንዳበልት እንዳቀነሰት ምምጻኣ እዩ"" (The reason for this is that the moon is slowly shrinking).
"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ብዛዕባ ቅርጺ መሬት ኣየናይ ክልሰ-ሓሳብ እዩ ኣብ ወርሒ ዝፍጸም ጂኦሎጂ ፍጻመታት ከምዘሎ ዝሕብር?,"The correct answer is **D: እቶም ቅርጽታት መሬት ኣብ ቀረባ እዋን እዮም ተፈጢሮም**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the ""ኩርጽራጻት"" (ridges or wrinkles) appear to be recently formed, implying recent geological activity.  This is the core argument challenging the idea that the moon is geologically inactive.
"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ክሳብ ክሲ ዝቐርብ ካብዚ ንላዕሊ እንታይ ኣይክህሉን?,"The correct answer is **A: ተወሳኺ ርእይቶታት**.

The passage states: ""ሓፈሻዊ ክሲ ዝቕበል ቤት ፅሕፈት ክረውን ክሲ ክሳብ ዝቐርብ ተወሳኺ መግለፂ ከምዘይውሃብ ንጋዜጠኛታት ገሊፁ."" This directly translates to ""The General Prosecution Office also stated to journalists that no further explanations would be given until charges are filed."" ""ተወሳኺ መግለፂ"" means further explanations or comments.
"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ንሲለርስ ህሉው ጸገም ዘይኮነ እንታይ እዩ?,"ትኽክለኛ መልሲ: D: ምቕላጥ በረድ

ብዘይካ እቲ በረድ፡ ካልእ ንጻዕርታት ምድሓን ህይወት ዝጸልዎ እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ኩነታት ኣየር**.

The passage explicitly states that ""ብርቱዕ ኩነታት አየርን"" (severe weather conditions) weakened the rescue efforts in addition to the blizzard.
"
ሮበርትስ ንኣየናይ እምነት እዩ ካብ ምጽዳቕ ተቖጢቡ?,"The correct answer is **C: ናይ ህይወት መጀመርታ (The beginning of life)**.

The passage states that Roberts Flatley didn't want to speak about his beliefs regarding ""when life begins"" because it is a crucial ethical topic in the abortion debate and he thinks giving individual opinions on potential cases is outside the realm of ethics.
"
ሮበርትስ ብዛዕባ ኣየናይ ጕዳይ እዩ ኽትመያየጥ ኣዝዩ ዘይስነምግባራዊ ኮይኑ እተሰምዖ?,"The correct answer is **D: ዝርዝር ጕዳያት** (Detailed cases).

The passage states that Roberts Flatley believes it is unethical to comment on individual cases regarding when life begins, which is central to the ethical debate around abortion. He doesn't want to give his opinion on the specific circumstances of individual cases related to this issue.
"
እተን ክልተ ኣግማድ ብርሃን ኣበይ እየን ዝበርሃ?,"The passage states ""ብምሸት ናብ ሰማይ ዝበርሁ ክልተ ጩራታት ብርሃን ተገጢሞም ኣለዉ"" which translates to ""In the evening, two beams of light shone into the sky.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: ናብ ሰማይ ገጽ (Into the sky)**
"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ኣብቲ ቦታ ሓደስቲ ሰማይ ጠቀስ ህንጻታት መዓስ ይህነጹ ኣለዉ?,"The correct answer is **D: እቲ ህንጸት ቀፃሊ እዩ (The construction is ongoing)**.

The passage states: ""ኣብ'ቲ ከባቢ ሓሙሽተ ሓደሽቲ ሰማይ ጠቀስ ናይ ምህናጽ ከይዲ ይቕጽል ኣሎ (In that area, the construction of five new skyscrapers is ongoing)."" The word ""ይቕጽል ኣሎ (is ongoing)"" indicates the construction is in progress.
"
እተን ሸውዓተ ኣሕዋት በዓትታት ምዃነን ዝሕብር እንታይ ሓበሬታ ኣሎ?,"The correct answer is **A: ምቅይያር ሙቐት (Changing temperature)**.

The passage states: ""ፎቶታት ከምዘርእይዎ ካብ ለይቲ ናብ ለይቲ ረስኒ ዝቐያየረሉ መንገዲ ባዓቲ ከምዝኾኑ የርኢ (Photos show they are a type of cave because they change temperature from day to night).""  This directly links the temperature variation to them being a type of cave. The other options are mentioned in the passage, but they are not stated as evidence of them being caves.
"
ናይ ሸውዓተ ኣሓት ሙቐታዊ ባህሪ ብኸመይ ይዕዘብ?,"The passage states: ""ፎቶታት ከምዘርእይዎ ካብ ለይቲ ናብ ለይቲ ረስኒ ዝቐያየረሉ መንገዲ ባዓቲ ከምዝኾኑ የርኢ።"" This implies that the thermal behavior of the caves (the ""Seven Sisters"") is observed through photos that show temperature changes from night to day. While the passage doesn't explicitly use the term ""infrared imagery,"" the fact that temperature changes are being observed through photographs suggests a method sensitive to heat, which is commonly achieved with infrared imagery.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: ትሕተ-ቀይሕ ምስልታት (Infrared imagery)**. While not stated explicitly, it's the most logical method given the context."
ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ: ብዛዕባ እቲ ጥርጡር ኣየናይ መግለጺ እዩ ሓቂ ዘይኮነ?,"The correct answer is **D: ኣይተጎድአን ነይሩ (He was not injured)**.

The passage states: ""ካብቲ ነትጒ ኣብ ልዕሊኡ ጉድኣት ድሕሪ ምውራዱ ኣብ ትሕቲ ቐይዲ ኣትዩ."" This translates to ""He was taken into custody after suffering injuries from the explosion."" Therefore, the statement that he was not injured is false.
"

The passage explicitly states ""ሓደ ጋይሮስኮፕ እንተጠፍአ (if one gyroscope was lost)."" The question asks what problem the space station encountered.
"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ዕላማ ተልእኾ መደበር ጠፈር እንታይ እዩ ነይሩ?,"Based on the passage, the mission's objective wasn't explicitly stated as finding the lost gyroscope, approaching the blooming people, or moving the jets. The passage mentions the station maintaining morale until the end of the space mission. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: ናይ ጠፈር ጉዕዞ ምዝዛም (Ending the space mission)**

The passage states ""ቪዳል ቅድሚ ሰለስት ወቕትታት ካብ ሲቪላ ናብ ባርሳ ተቐላቒሉ።"" which translates to ""Vidal joined Barca from Sevilla three seasons ago."" This clearly indicates he came from Sevilla.
"
ቪዳል ምስ ባርሳ ክንደይ ጸወታታት ተጻዊቱ?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The text states that Vidal has played 49 games for Barcelona since joining them.

The passage explicitly states that the earthquake didn't meet the 6.5 magnitude threshold required for a tsunami warning, which is why the agency couldn't issue one.  The other options aren't the reason given in the passage.
"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ እቲ ምንቅጥቃጥ ምድሪ እንታይ ኣስዒቡ?,"The correct answer is **A: ዝሰንበዱ ደቂ ዓዲ (ዝሰንበዱ ደቂ ዓዲ)**.

The passage states that even though there was no tsunami warning, the residents started evacuating their homes and workplaces out of fear. This clearly indicates that the earthquake caused the residents to panic and become afraid.

Although the other things are not explicitly explained, the following statement says that ""ድምቀትን ዙረትን ኮኾብ ምስ ዋሕዚ ፕላዝማ ዝምድና ዘለዎ..."" which translates to ""Brightness and rotation of a star are related to plasma flow..."", meaning that plasma flow is a main driver. The other options refer to factors related to the level of activity or indicators of magnetic activity, but they are not the primary drivers of the stars' activity."
ናይ ሓደ ኮኾብ ቁጽሪ ሮስቢ ብኸመይ ይውሰን?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: ብርሃንን ምዝዋርን (Brightness and rotation)**.

Let's examine why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: እቲ ውጽኢት ነቶም ቅድሚ ሕጂ ዓይነት 1 ሕማም ሽኮር ዘለዎም ሕሙማት ጠቓሚ ክኸውን ይኽእል እዩ (The result may be useful for those who previously had type 1 diabetes.)** The passage specifically states that other scholars doubt the results because the results are unlikely to make any change for people with type 1 diabetes.
*   **C: እቲ ርኽበት ፈውሲ ኽኮን ከም ዝኽእል ተስፋ ኣለዎ (There is hope that the discovery could be a cure.)** The passage says that Dr. Yur and other scholars doubt whether the results could lead to a cure.
*   **D: ገለ ሕማም ሽኮር ዘይብሎም ኣናጹ ሕጂ ሕማም ሽኮር ኣለዎም (Some rats who do not have diabetes now have diabetes.)** This is the opposite of what the passage describes."

The passage states the plane attempted to land *twice*: once initially (which was aborted) and then a second time shortly before crashing. It doesn't mention a third attempt. All the other statements (A, B, and D) are accurate based on the information in the passage.
"
ነፋሪት CG4684 ምዕላባ ከተቋርጽ ዝገበራ እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **D: እቲ ኩነታት ኣየር ሕማቕ እዩ ነይሩ** (The weather was bad).

The passage states that the search was hampered by the bad weather that prevented the plane from landing. This directly relates to why the plane aborted its landing attempt.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""ክብል ብህይወት ዝተረፈ ፍራንሲዜክ ኮዋል ሓቢሩ (said survivor Franciszek Kowal)."" This directly implies Franciszek Kowal survived the event unharmed.
*   The other options are not supported by the text.

    *   He is narrating that windows were being hit with chairs, not that he was injured.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""እቲ ህቦብላ ካብ መሬት ኣዝዩ ዝረሓቐ ብምዃኑ"" which translates to ""The hurricane is very far from land...""
* The passage states ""ኣብ ካሪብያን ዘለዎ ጽልዋ ኣይፍለጥን’ዩ"" which translates to ""Its impact on the Caribbean is unknown""

The passage clearly states: ""ብምክትል ቀዳማይ ሚኒስተር ሲንጋፖር ዎንግ ካን ሰንግ አቀባብላ ምስተገበረሉ..."" which translates to ""He was received by the Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore, Wong Kan Seng...""

This directly translates to ""After experiencing a week of defeat in the mid-term election, Bush told the observers about the expansion of trade to Asia."" Therefore, he spoke about the expansion of trade to Asia *after* the mid-term election defeat.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ናይ መንግስቲ ሓፈሻዊ ዕላም ዝኾነ ኣየናይ’ዩ ?,"The correct answer is **D: ልዕሊ ዓቐን ምጽቃጥ ተሸከምቲ ምቅላል** (Relieving overcrowding of transporters/carriers).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** The addition of 300 carriers, bringing the total to 1,300, ""ይቕንሶ ነቲ ምጭንናቕ"" which translates to ""will reduce the congestion/pressure.""

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: ዝያዳ ምወላ ተሸከምቲ ክሳብ ናይዚ ዓመት መጋቢት** (Increase funding for carriers until March of this year) - The passage focuses on the *number* of carriers, not funding.
* **B: 300 ጠቕላላ ተሸከምቲ ምጥራይ** (Eliminating 300 total carriers) - The passage explicitly states *adding* 300 carriers.
* **C: ተወሳኺ 1,300 ተሸከምቲ ምጥራይ** (Eliminating an additional 1,300 carriers) - The passage discusses increasing the total carriers to 1,300.

Therefore, the most accurate reflection of the government's general aim based on the passage is to alleviate overcrowding of transporters.
"

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the government's commitment to add carriers to alleviate pressure.** Options A and C are factually incorrect based on the passage (300 additional carriers, not 1300). Option D refers to a timeframe, not the core commitment made by the government. The passage explicitly states the government's commitment to alleviating the strain on carriers.

Although the threat of a serious one has decreased, it does not mean the threat has completely disappeared."")**

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ድሕሪ ሕጂ ዝኾነ ስግኣት የለን (There is no threat anymore)** - The quote specifically says the threat *has not* completely disappeared.
* **C: መጥቃዕቲ ክፍጸም ትጽቢት ይግበር (An attack is expected)** - The quote says there's *no* information suggesting an imminent attack.
* **D: እቲ መጥቃዕቲ ከቢድ ከምዝኸውን ስለያዊ ሓበሬታ ኣረጋጊጹ ኣሎ (Intelligence information has confirmed that the attack will be severe)** -  The quote states the opposite: the threat of a *serious* one has decreased.

Here's why:

*   **A:** The passage states that the presidential commission was a response to the protests.
*   **B:** The passage states that some parties have protested the failure to hold elections, some since 2011, so expired elections are a cause for protests.
*   **D:** While not explicitly stated, the passage mentions ""widespread constitutional protests,"" which often imply some level of unrest or potential for violence.

The passage states that the previous CEP resigned. Therefore, the protests did not specifically demand it be removed from power.
"

The statement indicates that USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation into the abuse committed by Larry Nassar and is open to any necessary changes.

This directly translates to creating a safe and encouraging environment for athletes. The other options are related, but are means to this end, not the primary goal itself.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the ship was *traveling to* Puerto Princesa in Palawan, not based there. Its actual home base is Sasebo, Nagasaki in Japan.
*   The other options are all stated in the passage as being true: It was going to Puerto Princessa; It is a mine countermeasure ship; It is assigned to the US Navy's Seventh Fleet."

The passage states ""እቲ ግጭት አብቲ ጎቦ ዝተፈጠረ..."" which translates to ""the conflict happened on the hill...""  Gobo (ጎቦ) means hill or mountain. Also, the passage mentions ""ክፉእ መሬትን"" which means difficult or bad terrain, which is characteristic of mountainous areas.

Thus, their hope is to stop sediment erosion, which is the same as restoring the sediment.
"

*   The amount of sediment reaching downstream areas.
*   The loss of two fish species.
*   The near-extinction of two other fish species, including the humpback chub.
*   The habitat of desert animals (due to the lack of sediment for sandbars and beaches).

Based on the passage, the dam's construction has permanently affected all of the options, to some degree. However, the question asked which one has been affected by the construction of the dam ""permanently"".

The correct answer is **B: Humpback Chubs**. The passage directly states that the humpback chub are near extinction because of the dam. While the other options have been affected, they are not necessarily permanent."

*   Wales lying from the beginning about the reason for the deletion (legal reasons).
*   Wales claiming they only heard from Curden about the deletion after it happened.

The passage mentions the new policy about sexual content as a *result* of the anger, not as a *cause* of Adam Curden's frustration. Therefore, option A is something that followed from the frustration, not one of its causes. The other options are directly mentioned as elements contributing to Curden's frustration.

*   **The passage states:** ""...ገለ ሰባት፡ ኣውሮፕላናት ብኸመይ ከምዝሰርሓን ኣብ እዋን በረራ እንታይ ከምዝኸውንን ዝምልከት ዝተወሰነ ፍልጠት ምሓዞም ኣብቲ ዘይተፈልጠ ወይ ኣብ ቁጽጽር ምስኣን ዝተመርኮሰ ፍርሖም ንምሽናፍ ክሕግዝ ይኽእል እዩ."" This directly links understanding how planes work with overcoming fear based on the unknown.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: ተሳፋራይ ብናቶም ፍርሒ እንተተሸቑሪሩ:** While someone overwhelmed by fear might *generally* benefit from understanding, this option is too broad. The passage specifically targets fear of the *unknown* aspects of flying.
*   **C: እቲ ተሳፋራይ ንኩሉ ዓይነት መጓዓዝያ ኣሉታዊ እንተኾይኑ:** If the passenger is generally negative about all modes of transport, understanding the workings of a plane is unlikely to solve the problem. Their negativity is the root issue, not just a lack of knowledge about airplanes.
*   **D: ጭንቀቶም ካብ ምስ በረራ ዘይተኣሳሰር ስንባደ ዝመልኦ ፍጻመታት ዝምንጩ እንተኾይኑ:** If the passenger's anxiety stems from unrelated traumatic events, understanding how a plane works wouldn't address the root cause of their fear.

**In summary:** The passage focuses on using knowledge to combat fear rooted in the unknown. Option B directly reflects this."

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ነዞም ውጽኢታት ምውድዳርን ቅድሚ ቲኬት ምግዛእ ድማ ናይ'ቲ መንገዲ ኣየር ዌብሳይት ምርኣይን ኣዝዩ እዩ ዘዋጽእ (comparing these results and *before* buying a ticket, looking at the airline's website is very worthwhile)."" This directly recommends checking the airline's website before making a purchase.
* While comparing prices among travel companies (C) is generally a good idea, the passage emphasizes the *airline's website* as the *final* step before buying.
* Buying directly from the airline (B) *without* comparing prices (A and C) or checking their website (D) goes against the entire point of the passage, which is to find the best price.
* Option A is an element that happens before the final action of checking the airline's website (D).

Therefore, checking the airline's website is presented as the concluding and most worthwhile action before purchasing a ticket to ensure the best price."

Here's why:

* The passage explains that sending items as checked baggage is a faster private method.
* It highlights the problem with traditional air cargo: delays due to unloading and customs.
* It also mentions that airline regulations do not allow sending luggage without a passenger.

ካብቲ ጥቕሲ መሰረት ብምግባር ኣብ ጥምረት ዘሎ አየር መንገዲ ክትመርጹ ከለኹም ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣየናይ እዩ ቀዳምነት ክውሃቦ ዝግባእ?,"The best answer based on the text is **D: እቲ ተወሳኺ ፍሉይ መሰላት ክውስኽ ዝኽእል መንገዲ ኣየር** (The airline that can add extra special privileges).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes comparing benefits:** The key takeaway is that you shouldn't just stick to your usual airline. You need to understand that ""ጥቕማጥቕሚ ኩሉግዜ ዝተፈላለዩን ኣብ ካልኦት ኣየርመንገድታት ኣብ ተመሳሳሊ ሽርክና ዘለዉ ዝሓሸ ክኾን ከምዝኽእልን"" (benefits are always different and could be better at other airlines in the same partnership). This implies you need to consider the *specific benefits* offered by different airlines within the partnership.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as good:

* **A: እቲ ዝበዝሐ ነጥቢ ዘቕርብ መንገዲ ኣየር** (The airline that offers the most points): While earning points is a benefit, the passage focuses on a broader comparison of *all* benefits, not just points.  Airlines might offer other more valuable perks.
* **B: እቲ ኣብ ዝዓበየ ጥምረት ዘሎ መንገዲ ኣየር** (The airline in the largest partnership): The *size* of the partnership doesn't guarantee better benefits for *you*. The passage focuses on finding the airline *within* the partnership that offers the best *specific* advantages.
* **C: እቲ ዝበዝሕ ግዜ እትጓዓዘሉ መንገዲ ኣየር** (The airline you travel with most often): The *entire point* of the passage is to avoid blindly sticking with your usual airline.

Therefore, the answer is **D**.  Focusing on ""ተወሳኺ ፍሉይ መሰላት"" (extra special privileges) aligns best with the text's message of comparing benefits and potentially finding a better option within the partnership.
"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ መን እዩ ዝያዳ ዝለመደ አየር መንገዲ ነጥብታት ከቕርብ ዝኽእል?,"The correct answer is **D: ኣብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ጥምረት ዝርከብ ዝተፈለየ መንገዲ ኣየር**.

Here's why:

* **P (The premise):**  The passage emphasizes the importance of carefully choosing an airline, even if you have a preferred one. It states that the benefits might be different and that better options might exist within *other* airlines in the *same partnership*.

This means the passage suggests that looking at other airlines *within the same partnership* could offer better rewards or benefits.

Let's break down why the other options aren't as accurate:

*   **A: ኣብ ዝተፈላለየ ጥምረት ዝርከብ ዝተፈላለየ መንገዲ ኣየር (Different airlines in different partnerships):** The passage explicitly mentions benefits may be better within airlines in the *same* partnership, not *different* ones.
*   **B: ኣብ ትሕቲ ሓደ ኪዳን ብብዝሒ እትጓዓዙሉ መንገዲ ኣየርኹም (Your frequent airline under one alliance):** The passage cautions against sticking *only* to your frequent airline.
*   **C: ብብዝሒ እትጓዓዙሉ መንገዲ ኣየርኹም ኣብ ዝተፈለየ ጥምረት (Your frequent airline in a different partnership):** the passage emphasizes the importance of staying within the *same partnership* to find better deals

Therefore, only option D lines up with the premise of the passage.

The passage states that the Canal District (ዳች ግራችተንጎርደል) has the highest property values in the country. The question asks where the highest property values are in Amsterdam. Therefore, the Canal District is the answer.
"

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ምሉእ ዲስትሪክት ን ብርቂ ባህላውን ታርኻውን ዋጋ ከም ናይ ዩኔስኮ ናይ ዓለም ቅርሲ ቦታ ተሓሲቡ ዝተነደፈ እዩ"" which translates to ""The entire district is designed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to its exceptional cultural and historical value.""

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: ፍሉይ ንብረት እዩ (ፍሉይ ንብረት እዩ)** While the area is unique, the primary reason for UNESCO designation mentioned is the *cultural and historical value*, not just uniqueness in general.
* **C: ኣብ ከባቢ ቢነንስታድ ዝርከብ ቦታ እዩ (ኣብ ከባቢ ቢነንስታድ ዝርከብ ቦታ እዩ)** This is a fact about its location, but not the reason for its UNESCO status.  Location alone doesn't make something a World Heritage Site.
* **D: ልዑል ዋጋ ዘለዎ ንብረት እዩ (ልዑል ዋጋ ዘለዎ ንብረት እዩ)**  While the passage mentions high property values, this is a *consequence* of its desirability and historical significance, not the *reason* for the UNESCO designation.  UNESCO doesn't designate sites solely based on property value.

Therefore, **A** is the most direct and accurate answer based on the information provided.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   B: The passage mentions that an Angkor ticket is *required* to enter the temple, not that it makes the visit worthwhile.
*   C: The passage only mentions Sim Reap to note that Phnom Krom is located a certain distance from the city.
*   D: The passage mentions the boat ride as a *possible* way to travel to the site, not necessarily a highlight that makes the visit worthwhile."

While the passage discusses *modern* telescopes, it contrasts them with pre-modern observations which were *not* hindered by light pollution because it was less of an issue in cities and camps. This implies that pre-modern observatories would *not* likely be in remote locations where modern telescopes are.  Therefore, the *least* likely place for a pre-modern observatory (based on this text) is a remote location.

Here's why:

*   **ሊንጓ ፍራንካ (Lingua Franca)** are languages that arise naturally for communication between people who speak different native languages. They evolve organically through use and necessity.
*   The paragraph describes **""ሓገዝቲ ቋንቋታት (Auxiliary Languages)""** as being ""ሰብ ዝሰርሖም ወይ ከኣ ዝተሃንጹ ቋንቋታት (man-made or constructed languages)."" Therefore, they are the opposite of organic.

* **P (the initial statement)** explicitly states that auxiliary languages are *constructed* languages (ሰብ ዝሰርሖም ወይ ከኣ ዝተሃንጹ ቋንቋታት). They are *not* natural languages. Option B contradicts this core characteristic of auxiliary languages.
* **A** is wrong because auxiliary languages are constructed, not organic.
* **C** is true because it aligns with the definition provided in P.
* **D** is true because it accurately highlights the difference between auxiliary languages and lingua francas. Lingua Francas rise spontaneously, while auxiliary languages are designed.

Therefore, the statement that *incorrectly* describes auxiliary languages is **B**.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ተሳፈርቲ መርከብ ጉዕዞኦም ኣብ ሓጋይ እንተኾይኑ እንታይ ክፍትሹ ኣለዎም?,"Let's analyze the passage to determine what passengers should check if their cruise is in the summer.

*   The passage mentions checking the address of the accommodation for those who are uncomfortable traveling through ice, specifically relevant to a winter Baltic cruise.
*   The passage states that cruise passengers are not allowed visas. Therefore, visa requirements are unnecessary for them.
*   The contract is available for inspection, but it doesn't seem to be specific to the summer cruise, but rather a general cruise agreement.
*   The passage mentions that the St. Petersburg cruise includes all the time spent in the city, but it doesn't suggest that this is a detail that needs to be checked *specifically* in the summer.

Since the cold and ice are only relevant in winter, the accommodation address is not relevant for a summer cruise.

Therefore, the best answer is **C: እቲ ውዕላት**. The contract contains important information about passenger rights and obligations. Regardless of the season, passengers should always inspect it."
ብመሰረት’ቲ ክፍሊ፡ ተሳፈርቲ መርከብ ጉዕዞኦም ኣብ ሓጋይ እንተኾይኑ፡ ካብ ምንታይ ክድሕኑ ይኽእሉ?,"The correct answer is **C: ናይ ቪዛ ረቛሒታት (Requirements for visas)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ተሳፈርቲ መርከብ ቪዛ ክረኽቡ ኣይፍቀደሎምን። (እቲ ውዕል ምርኣይ ይከኣል)"" which translates to ""Cruise passengers are not allowed to obtain visas. (The contract can be seen)"". This indicates that visa requirements are a concern for cruise passengers.
* **The question asks:** What can passengers avoid if their cruise is in the summer?
* **The critical point is that the passage only provides information about *winter* cruises. We can't assume anything about the summer cruises based on that.** The passage mentions ice navigation, hearing complaints, and spending all time in the city in the *context* of a northern Baltic winter cruise.

Because visa issues apply whether it is winter or summer, this answer is the most accurate response.

The passage states, ""ቤይጂንግ መኽፈትን መዛዘሚ ምድላዋት ሓዊሱ ናይ ውሽጢ ገዛ ጸዋታታት በረድ ክትእንግድ እያ."" This translates to ""Beijing will host indoor ice sports, including the opening and closing ceremonies.""  While Beijing is hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics overall (C), and thus the opening and closing ceremonies (D), the passage specifically mentions hosting *indoor* ice sports (B). Option A is incorrect because Beijing is hosting the Winter Olympics, not the Summer Olympics, in 2022.

(Most cases involve people involved in poultry farming, although bird keepers are also at risk.) While bird keepers are also at risk, the passage indicates that poultry farmers are at the *highest* risk.

*   **B: ካብ ኣዕዋፍ ንላዕሊ ኣብ ደቅሰብ ብዙሕ ጕዳያት ተራእዩ እዩ (There have been more cases in humans than birds)** - The passage mentions the opposite; that cases in humans are very few (less than a thousand).
*   **D: ኩሎም ኣብ ደቂ ሰባት ዝተገልጹ ሕሙማት ሞት ዘስዓቡ እዮም (All the cases reported in humans have resulted in death)** - The passage states that although only a few cases have occurred, some resulted in death, thus implying that not all cases were fatal.

Option C is the only one that directly reflects information presented in the passage, stating bird owners are at risk of infection."

The text states: ""እቲ ፃዕዳ ባሕሪ ባልቲክ ካናል አንታርቲካ ውቕያኖስ ምስ ፀሊም ባሕሪ..."" which means that the White Sea-Baltic Canal connects the Arctic Ocean (referred to as ""Antarctica Ocean"" in the text) with the Baltic Sea.

*   **Q** asks about issues that would be *more* likely in the high tropics compared to Singapore.
*   Options **A** and **D** are less likely due to Singapore's high security and easy navigation.
*   Option **B** is less likely due to Singapore's multitude of shops where you can buy whatever you desire after travelling there.
*   Option **C** is the only option that aligns with the description of the high tropics and that being ""feverish heat"" and having to ""endure the heat"". This directly relates to the possibility of heat exhaustion."

The passage explicitly states that budget travelers should not beg (""ኣይልሙኑን"" - ""don't beg""). The other options align with the principles of budget travel outlined in the passage:

*   **A: ኣብ እዋን መገሻታትኩም ክትገብሩዎም እትኽእሉ ፍሉይ ስራሕ ድለዩ (Look for specific work you can do during your travels):** While not directly stated, this aligns with working while traveling to reduce costs.

*   **A: ነዊሕ ዝርግሐ ዘለዎ ርሑቕ ገጠር ጽርግያ ኣሎ (There is a long stretch of remote rural road)** The passage describes the route as passing through isolated forests, indicating a rural and likely remote setting. So, this statement aligns with the text.

*   **B: ናይ ጽርጊያ መስመራት ጽኑዕ እዮም (The road lanes are rigid)** The passage mentions steep roads, narrow roads, and sharp bends, suggesting the roads are not rigid. So, this statement does not accurately portray the roads.

*   **C: ገደብ ፍጥነት ሳሕቲ እዩ ዝኽበር (Speed limits are rarely respected)** The passage explicitly states that speed limits are lower than usual and that adhering to them is essential. This means they *should* be respected, and it is not implied that they are rarely respected.

*   **D: ኣገልግሎት ሞባይል ዛዕባ ክኸውን የብሉን (Mobile service should not be a problem)** The passage states that mobile service is unusually strong compared to other roads, particularly in the Pennsylvania Wilds. So this is correct.

Based on the information from the passage, only ""C"" doesn't fit, and the negative construction of the question asks which does NOT accurately describe the drive. ""B"" accurately describes the road but not in the way stated in the passage. The passage states that there are steep and winding roads, so the opposite of that is that the roads are not rigid.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
**B**"

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes the presence of ""ቁልቁለት መገድታት፣ ፀበብቲ መገድታትን ሹል መጠምዘቲታትን ብብዝሓት ኣለዉ"" and the need to adhere strictly to the low speed limits, indicating that sharp turns and fast driving are a major concern.
*   The passage explicitly states ""ዘደንቕ ኹነታት፣ ናይ ሞባይል ስልኪ ግልጋሎት ካብ ኻልኦት ብዙሓት መገድታት ንላዕሊ ኣብዚ ኣዝዩ ጥንኩር እዩ"", meaning that the phone service is stronger than most other roads in pennsylvania woods; so answer choice B is not right.
* The passage does not mention anything about heavy traffic or road work, so answer choices A and D are not right."

The passage explicitly contrasts canyoning with activities requiring high levels of fitness like alpine climbing. Other options are needed in canyoning."

Therefore, the answer is **B: ኣብ ናይ ስኩባ ዳይቪንግ ዝጸንሐ ተመኩሮ**.

Here's why:

*   **A: ምዕቡል ኣትሌቲካዊ ዓቕሚ (Advanced athletic ability):** The text explicitly states that canyoning requires *little* physical fitness compared to other activities.

*   **C: ናይ ብማይ ዘለዎ ውሽጢ ጎቦ ምንስፋፍ ዝተዋህበ ምስክር ወረቐት (Canyoning certification):** While certification may be beneficial or required in some cases, the text implies that it's not a necessary prerequisite for beginners.

*   **D: ናይ ምሕንባስ ክእለት (Climbing skills):** While some canyoning routes might involve climbing, the text distinguishes it from activities like rock climbing, suggesting it's not always a primary skill needed.

*   **B: ኣብ ናይ ስኩባ ዳይቪንግ ዝጸንሐ ተመኩሮ (Previous scuba diving experience)**. Since canyoning involves moving through canyons with water, having some experience of working in water would be useful."

Here's why:

*   The passage directly states that ""ምዕራፍ ዝከኣል መደቀሲ ዘለዎም ዓባይ ሚኒቫን፣ ኤስዩቪ፣ ሲዳን ወይ ስቴሽን ዋጎን ዝተብሃላ ዓይነታት መኪና እንተለካ እዩ"" (Having a large minivan, SUV, sedan, or station wagon that has a place to sleep is ideal). This implies the ability to sleep comfortably is a key factor.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: ብዛዕባ ድሩትነት መኪናኹም ጽኑዕ ርድኢት** (A solid understanding of the limitations of your car): While knowing your car's limitations is useful for road trips in general, it doesn't directly address the ability to sleep in the car.
*   **C: ዳስ** (Tent): The passage contrasts sleeping in a car with camping in a tent, implying that a tent is an alternative to sleeping in the car, not an aid to it.
*   **D: ክትዓድሩሉ እትኽእሉ ናይ ውልቀ ንብረት** (Private property to camp on): The passage mentions that setting up a tent on private property can attract unwanted attention, suggesting it's not a helpful aid for someone who wants to sleep in their car discreetly."

The passage states that setting up camp in a small town or on private property ""easily attracts unwanted attention."" This is the key phrase that indicates how to stay under the radar while car camping.

The passage explicitly states that Sintra ""ምስተመለሰት ኣደነቕቲ ሃፍትታት መሐጎሲ ታሪኽን ንናይ ወጻኢ ዜጋታት ተፈላጢት ኮይና እያ(became known to foreign nationals after being revived by Lord Byron, who praised its wealth of historical monuments)"". This directly links Lord Byron's praise to Sintra's popularity among foreigners.
"

The passage states that no sovereign country, ""not even Armenia,"" officially recognized the new republic formed in Nagorno-Karabakh.  Therefore, the answer is that even Armenia didn't recognize the new republic.
"

The passage clearly states that the conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region and the diplomatic disputes surrounding it have negatively affected the relationship between Armenia and Azerbaijan. While the 1994 war (B) and diplomatic disputes (C) are contributing factors, they stem from the central issue of the Nagorno-Karabakh region itself. Option A is incorrect because the text says the Nagorno-Karabakh region is a region inhabited by ethnic Armenians inside of Azerbaijan.

The passage states that ""ካብ 2 ንላዕሊ ተሳፈርቲ ምሓዝ ክፍሊት መቕጻዕቲ ኣለዎ"" which translates to ""Having more than 2 passengers has a penalty fee."" This directly supports option B.
"

The passage states that taxis in Charlotte are not frequently used and can be expensive, especially for more than two passengers. This makes using taxis a potential downside when living in Charlotte, particularly with children. The other options are either positives (families finding Charlotte attractive, people moving there due to family) or not directly addressed as downsides.

"
‘ሲንኬ ቴሬ’ ዝብል ናይ ጥልያን ቃል እንታይ እዩ ዘመልክት?,"The correct answer is **A: ሓሙሽተ ቁሸታት** (Hamushte Kushetat - Five Villages).

The first sentence of the passage states that ""Cinque Terre ትርጉሙ ሓሙሽተ ምድርታት ማለት ኮይኑ ነቶም ሓሙሽተ ነኣሽቱ ኣብ ገማግም ባሕሪ ኣብ ሊጉርያ ክልል ናይ ጥልያን ዝርከቡ ገጠራት ድማ የጠቓልል"" which translates to ""Cinque Terre means 'Five Lands' and encompasses five small villages on the coast of Liguria, Italy"". While ""lands"" might be interpreted broadly, the passage specifies that these are villages (ገጠራት). Therefore, ""five villages"" is the most accurate translation within the context provided.

*   ""እቶም ናይ ጫማ ብራኸታት ትሑታትን ገፋሕቲን ክኾኑ ኣለዎም"" (Shoe heels should be low and wide)

Based on this, the best answer is:

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ጸቢብ ብራኸ ወይ ሂል ዘለዎ ጫማ** (Footwear with narrow heels) The text specifies that heels should be *wide*.
*   **C: ልዑል ብርኪ ወይ ሂል ዘለዎ ጫማ** (Footwear with high heels) The text specifies that heels should be *low*.
*   **D: 1/5 ኢንች ዕምቆት ዘለዎ ቅርጺ ዘይብሉ ጫማ** (Footwear without a pattern of 1/5 inch depth) The text specifies that patterns should be at least 1/5 inch in depth."

The passage states: ""ምስ ሃዋይ ብተመሳሳሊ ናይ ሰዓት ዞን ዘለዋ..."" (It has the same time zone as Hawaii...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ክልቲኦም ብዙሓት ዓበይቲ ሆቴላት ኣለዎም** (Both have many large hotels): The passage says Cook Islands *don't* have the large hotel developments of Hawaii.
*   **B: ክልቲኦም መንግስታዊነት የብሎምን** (Both don't have governments): This is incorrect, as the passage describes Cook Islands as a country.
*   **D: ክልቲኦም ከተማታት የብሎምን** (Both don't have cities): While the passage does say that Cook Islands do not have cities, it doesn't state that Hawaii does not have cities.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: **""ደሴታት ኩክ ከተማታት ዘይብለን ይኹን እምበር...""** which translates to ""The Cook Islands, even though they don't have cities..."" This directly contradicts option C, which claims they have main cities.

The other options are supported by the text:

*   A: While the exact size comparison isn't stated, the phrase """"ሃዋይ ናብ ታሕቲ"""" (Hawaii to the south) implies a similarity or lesser size in comparison to Hawaii.

The passage states that Sirena provides ""መሕደርን ውዑይ ምግብን"" (accommodation and hot food). The other options, La Leona, San Pedrillo, and Los Patos, ""ካምፕ ዘቅርብዎ ግልጋሎት ምግቢ እንተየካተተ እዩ"" (provide camping services without food included). This means Sirena is the only ranger station listed that offers two types of amenities: accommodation and food.

*   The other options are incorrect because:

    *   ሲረና: While you need a permit to stay in Sirena, the passage doesn't specifically mention you can obtain a permit there, nor does it mention payment options.
    *   ካፌኔት ኤል ሶል: It can book a place for you at a cost and you will find more information on the Corcovado webpage.

The passage specifically states that travelers sometimes find it difficult to adjust back to their own culture after living abroad (""ወጻኢ ሃገር ድሕሪ ነቢርካ ናብ ሃገርኩም ምስ ተመልሱ ምስ ሓድሽ ባህሊ ተላሚድኩምን ዝተወሰኑ ልምድታትኩም ናይ ገዛኩም ባህሊ ኣጥፊእኩም ኢኩም።"").  This is the core idea of reverse culture shock or re-entry shock.

Here's why:

* The premise (P) states that moose are not naturally aggressive, but will defend themselves if threatened.
* The premise also warns against being overly confident around moose, implying that people underestimate the danger.
* Ignoring a moose's presence means you are likely approaching too closely, failing to gauge the moose's reaction, and potentially provoking it.

The other options are safer behaviors:

* **B: ኣዝዩ ቀስ ኢልካ ምቕራብ (Approaching very slowly):** This would allow the moose to get used to you, give you time to react, and give you a way to turn back if the moose gets agitated.
* **C: ክህልዎም ዝኽእል ደረጃ ስግኣት ምንካይ (Reducing the level of threat they might perceive):** This is a proactive approach that acknowledges the moose's potential reaction to your presence.
* **D: ካብ ርሑቕ ምዕዛብ (Observing from a distance):** This is the safest option, as it minimizes the risk of startling or threatening the moose.

Here's why:

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate or less directly stated:

*   **B: ማይ ዋርዋርታ ከም ዝህልወካ ዝገብር መስትያት ምርኣይ (Seeing a mirage that makes you think there is water)** While seeing a mirage is part of the danger, the danger is the *reaction* to the mirage (chasing it) rather than just seeing it.
*   **C: ንሓደ ዋርዋርታ እናተኸታተልካ ጸዓት ምብኻን (Wasting energy following a mirage)**
*   **D: ንሓደ ዋርዋርታ እናሰዓበ ማይ ምብኻን (Wasting water following a mirage)**
These both describe the consequence of the mirage, which is wasting energy and water. While dangerous, the passage emphasizes the risk of the *combination* of these factors.

**Therefore, option A is the most direct and least dangerous consequence of desert travel based on the passage.**"

*   **ውሑድ ሙቐተ-ሰብነት (C: Hypothermia):** Explicitly stated as a danger due to cold nights.

**ጸሓይ ምንዳድ (D: Sunburn)** is not mentioned in the passage.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that **Madagascar** is known for its wealth of animals. It does *not* say that the smaller islands of East Africa are known for this.
*   The passage *does* mention the other options:
    *   **A: ምስ ፈረንሳ እተተሓሓዘ ርክብ (Connected with France):** The passage says that most of the smaller islands are either independent nations or under French rule.
    *   **B: ብዙሓት ምቾት ዝመልኦም መዘናግዒ ቦታታት (Many Comfortable Entertainment Places):** The passage mentions that they are known as sophisticated resort islands.
    *   **D: ካብ ካልኦት ሃገራት ናጽነት (Independence from other countries):** The passage mentions that most of the smaller islands are either independent nations.

Therefore, option C is the characteristic that is *not* specifically associated with the smaller East African islands in the passage."

The passage states: ""ብዙሕ ግዜ ባህላዊ ቤተክርስትያናት ትንሳኤ እየሱስ ክርስቶስ ንምብዓል ፍርቒ ለይቲ ነቲ ባዓል ብምክፍፋል..."" which translates to ""Many times, cultural churches celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ by dividing the feast at midnight..."" This implies staying awake during the night to celebrate.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **A: ናይ ምርባሕ ልምዲ ምህላው (Having a custom of reproduction):** The passage mentions that the tradition has roots in pre-Christian and reproductive practices, but it doesn't directly explain how churches *celebrate* the Resurrection.
*   **C: ንጉባኤ ናይ ጽድያ ድግስ ምግባር (Holding a feast of righteousness for the congregation):** Although the passage suggests that the Easter time serves as Passover entertainment, it's more about the timing than a specific description of the celebration itself.
*   **D: ጸሓይ ክትበርቕ ምርኣይ (Seeing the sun rise):** While the passage mentions seeing the sunrise after staying up all night, the core of how the Resurrection is celebrated (according to the passage) is the midnight division and the night vigil, not the act of watching the sunrise itself."

* The other options are less directly related to the cost discrepancy explained in the passage:

    *   **A: ዓይኒ ምርመራ (Ayni mermera - Eye examination):** The passage mentions insurance covering eye exams.
    *   **C: ናይ ምርኣይ ኢንሹረንስ (Nayi mermira'i inshurans - Vision insurance):** This would reduce cost, not increase it when traveling abroad.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that in countries with lower labor costs, particularly in low-income countries, there can be two problems with high-end frame purchases.
*   One problem is that they could be **counterfeit** (ናይ ምንኩሕዃሕ ክኾኑ ይኽእሉ።).

The other options are less directly supported by the text:

*   **A: ተወሳኺ ምርመራ ዓይኒ ከድሊ ይኽእል እዩ (Additional eye exams may be needed)**: While eye exams are mentioned, the passage doesn't imply that they are related to the danger of buying high-end frames abroad.

*   **B: እቲ ትእዛዝ መድሃኒት ንገለ ፍሬማት ቅኑዕ ክኸውን ኣይክእልን እዩ (The prescription might not be right for some frames)**: The passage mentions prescriptions but doesn't connect them to the specific danger of buying frames abroad.

*   **D: ኢንሹረንስ ነቲ ወጻኢታት ዘይክሽፍኖ ይኽእል እዩ (Insurance may not cover the costs)**: While insurance coverage is generally mentioned, it is not directly linked to the potential risks of buying high-end frames abroad, specifically."

It then suggests using English or US currency and confirming the accepted payment method with the owners. This directly implies credit cards are less reliable on the outer islands.
*   The other options are incorrect because the text indicates credit cards are generally accepted in Stanley (D), and doesn't specifically mention using an alternative to credit cards at FIC West (A) or on all of the islands (B)."

*   Seeking upgrades to business or first class is a way to spend more money.
*   Asking about reducing the price of business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B is generally pointless.

This implies that *avoiding* direct flights is the way to save money, which directly corresponds with option C.

This indicates that attempting to negotiate lower prices for Business or First class seats on direct flights is unlikely to be successful. While the passage doesn't explicitly say ""discount rates,"" the idea of trying to lower the price of these premium tickets aligns with the concept of seeking a discount.

The question asks what *doesn't* need to be included when comparing the total cost of an Africa trip versus a round-the-world trip.  The passage implies the comparison is about adding up the *additional* expenses incurred *outside* of Africa when choosing the round-the-world trip instead of just the Africa trip.

*   **A, C, and D** all represent additional costs you would only incur if you chose the round-the-world trip (and traveled to places outside of Africa).  These are expenses *outside* of Africa.

*   **B** is a cost inherent in the African trip itself, regardless of whether you choose a round-the-world trip. The question is asking for extra costs associated with going *outside* of Africa.

The passage states that ""some [supermarkets] even offer microwave ovens or other food-warming equipment."" This directly addresses the convenience factor of being able to purchase and immediately heat prepared foods. The other options are not as relevant to convenience for ready-made meals:

*   **A: ኣብቲ ቦታ ዝርከቡ ሬስቶራንት** - The presence of a restaurant might be a draw, but it is not directly related to the purchase and consumption of prepared foods from the supermarket itself.

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣየናይ እዩ ፈረንሳይኛ ብዝዛረቡ ቤልጅየማውያንን ስዊዝን ዘይርድእዎ?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is:

**D: ኣብ ፈረንሳይ ዝዝረብ መብዛሕትኡ ፈረንሳይኛ**

Here's why:

*   The text states that all French speakers in Belgium and Switzerland are taught standard French and understand the standard numbering system.
*   It also mentions that there are minor differences in the numbering system and pronunciation of some words in Belgian and Swiss French compared to French French.
*   Therefore, options A, B, and C are understandable to French-speaking Belgians and Swiss people.
*  This implies that while there are minor differences, the core French spoken in France is still largely understandable in Belgium and Switzerland.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ብፍሉይ፣ ቁጽራዊ ስርዓት ኣብ ተዛረብቲ ፈረንሳኛ በልጁምን ስዊዘርላንድን ካብቲ ኣብ ፈረንሳ ዝዝረብ ፈረንሳኛ ገለ ንኣሽቱ ፍልልያት ኣለዎ"" (Specifically, the number system among French speakers in Belgium and Switzerland has some small differences from the French spoken in France). This directly identifies the number system as different.
* **The passage also states:** ""ኣደማምጻ ናይ ገለ ቃላት ቁሩብ ፍልይ ዝበለ እዩ"" (The pronunciation of *some* words is slightly different). This contradicts option A, which says ""the pronunciation of *all* words.""
* **The passage states:** ""ኩሎም ፈረንሳይኛ ቋንቋ ተዛረብቲ ቤልጅምያውያንን ስዊሲን ኣብ ትምርቲ ቤት ስሩዕ ፈረንሳይኛ ተዝማህሩ ኔሮም"" (All French-speaking Belgians and Swiss people have learned standard French in school). This contradicts option C.
* The passage does not mention spelling differences, so D is not a supported answer.

Therefore, only option B is explicitly stated as a difference in the provided text.

The passage states: ""ብኹሉ ኩነታት ብቀጥታ ካብቲ መንገዲ ኣየር ብስልክኻ ክትምዝግቦ ኣለካ።"" (In all cases, you must book directly from the airline by phone.)

(If you don't have a data connection on your phone, or are offline, their functionality may be impaired or nonexistent.) This directly implies that a dedicated GPS device is better when you're offline, as it doesn't rely on a data connection.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: ገንዘብ ክትቁጥብ ኣብ እትፍትነሉ እዋን** (When you are trying to save money): The passage generally suggests using a phone app saves money.
*   **B: ዳታ ኮነክሽን ከም ዝህልወካ ምስ ኣረጋገጽካ** (After confirming that you will have a data connection): If you have a data connection, the phone app is described as the better option.
*   **D: መሳርሒ ክትካረ ኣብ ዘይትደልየሉ እዋን** (When you don't want to rent a device): This is a general preference, but the passage doesn't suggest this as a specific *advantage* of using a dedicated GPS device."

The passage states that GPS applications on smartphones are convenient EXCEPT when you don't have a data connection. Standalone GPS devices don't rely on a data connection, so that's the advantage they have over smartphones.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Special food, drinks, and entertainment:** To keep guests in a good mood and on the premises. (B and C are related to this)
*   **Alcohol:** To impair judgment.

The passage does **not** mention using natural light. Therefore, the answer is:

The other options are incorrect because they are not directly related to the advice given to a smart gambler in the passage:

* **B: ዝኾነ ይኹን መተባብዒ ምቕባል (Accepting any encouragement):** The passage mentions special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood, but doesn't advise against accepting encouragement.
* **C: ናይ መንደቕ ሰዓት ወይ ናይ ዒድ ሰዓት ምርዓይ (Looking at a wall clock or a wristwatch):** The passage mentions that clocks are often missing, not that gamblers should avoid looking at them.

This directly indicates that writing is made more difficult by capitalized nouns.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ኣብ መንጎ ግሲታት ምፍላይ (Differentiating between verbs):** The passage mentions that capitalization helps differentiate between verbs and nouns, implying it makes the distinction *easier*, not harder.

However, none of the answer options provided are hand gestures. The passage also states that beckoning with fingers (like ""come here"") is common in Western countries.
Given that the passage doesn't describe the action ""come here"" in detail besides beckoning fingers and waving, the closest answer would be:

*   **B: ኣመልካቲት ኣጻብዕቲ ምጥዋይ (Beckoning with fingers)**

Therefore, the best answer is B."

This causes cracks and fissures that can obscure the ice bridge.""  Therefore, the instability and movement of the ice, specifically related to the ice bridge, are the cause of the cracks.

The passage states: ""እዚ ኣብ ናይ በረድ ድልድል(ቢንቶ) ክድብዝዝ ዝኽእል ንቓዓት፣ ስንጣቓት የኸትል።"" This directly translates to ""This causes pores and cracks that can be hidden in ice bridges."" Therefore, cracks are the ones that can be hidden by ice bridges.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states ""ዝኾነ ካብ ጎማ ወጻኢ ዝግበሩ ዑደታት ኩነታት ናይቲ ኣብ ሰሜናዊ ክፍለ ሃገር ኪቩ ዝቐጽል ዘሎ ውግእ ድሕሪ ምጽራይ ክኾኑ ይግባእ (Any excursions outside of Goma should be checked for the situation of the ongoing war in the northern Kivu region)."" This clearly indicates that travelers need to be cautious about the security situation *outside* of Goma, in the surrounding areas due to the conflict.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **A: እሳተ ጎመራ ኒራጎንጎ (Volcano Nyiragongo):** While the passage mentions Nyiragongo and its lava flow, the primary concern for travelers isn't the volcano itself, but rather the general security situation outside the city. Climbing the volcano is even mentioned as a tourist attraction.
*   **C: ማእከል ከተማ (City center):** The passage mentions the city center being destroyed by lava in the past, but it doesn't suggest any current safety precautions needed *within* the city center based on ongoing events.
*   **D: ሩዋንዳ (Rwanda):** The passage states Goma is near Rwanda, but there's no specific advice to take precautions regarding traveling *to* Rwanda.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that any trips outside of Goma should be planned after checking the status of the ongoing war in North Kivu, implying it is a safety concern, not entertainment. The other options are clearly supported as beneficial information by the text.

We need to find the date when the permit for August 1st becomes available. Four months prior to August is April. Therefore, the permit becomes available on April 1st.

The correct answer is **B: ሚያዝያ 1**

The passage states that there are ""ሒደት ቁፅሪ ዘለወን...ውሱን ቦታታት ስለዘለዋ"" which translates to ""a limited number of...limited spaces"". This directly supports the idea of a limited number of permits.

Let's look at why the other options are not the *best* answer:

*   **A: ቀዳማይ ዝመጸ ቀዳማይ ዝግልገለሉ ስርዓት ፍቓድ (First-come, first-served permit system)** While this is *partially* true, it only describes how the limited permits are *distributed*. The core policy for protecting the canyon in this context is the limited number of permits itself.
*   **B: ፍቓድ ኣብ 1 ጥሪ ጥራይ እዩ ዝወሃብ (Permits are only issued on January 1st)** This is incorrect; the passage states permits for a May 1st opening *become* available on January 1st, it doesn't say they're *only* issued on that date.
*   **C: ፍቓድ ብእግሪ ምእታው ብዝቐርብ ሕቶ ጥራይ እዩ ክርከብ ዝኽእል (Permits can only be obtained by foot traffic request)** While the passage focuses on hiking permits, it doesn't say that permits *only* exist for hiking. The main concept here is *limited* permits.

Therefore, **D** is the most accurate and complete answer.

Here's why:

*   **The passage emphasizes the hotels' historical significance and preservation of old-world charm.** The passage highlights ""classic fashion,"" ""period accessories,"" and ""a fine appreciation of age"" as integral to their character. Modern renovations would directly contradict this.

Let's look at why the other options are *likely* to be found:

*   **A: ናይ ኮክቴል ባር (Cocktail Bar)**: These hotels often have a history of luxury and sophistication, a cocktail bar would fit this profile.
*   **B: ኣብቲ ቦታ ዝርከብ ምግቢ ዝሽየጠሉ ቤት መግቢ (On-site restaurant)**: The passage explicitly mentions ""fine dining rooms and evening dinners,"" so restaurants are expected.
*   **C: ፍሉጣት ወይ ዝፍለጡ ብጾት ኣጋይሽ (Prominent or famous guests)**: The passage states that the hotels ""cater to the wealthy and famous."""

The passage also advises foreigners to avoid using the term, even though Greenlandic citizens may use it themselves.

*   **B: ገበን (Geben - Crime):** The text states that crime is rare in Greenland.

*   **B: ገዛ ናይ ቀደም ዛንታ ፍቕሪ (Home to an old love story)** The passage describes the Callejon del Beso and its associated love story.

*   **D: ናይ ቀደም ህንጻ ገዳም (An old building monastery)** The passage mentions that the site used to be a monastery in the 17th century. However, the only specific building mentioned is ""ቴምፓ ሳን ዲዬጎ ህንፃ (Templo San Diego building)"". While this might *have* been part of the monastery, the passage doesn't *explicitly* say it's a preserved monastery building itself, or that there are *other* old monastery buildings on the site. Moreover, the passage states that ቴምፓ ሳን ዲዬጎ ሕጂ ከም ማእከላይ ናይ ዕዳጋ ኣደባባይ ኮይኑ እዩ ዘገልግል (Templo San Diego now serves as a central market square), implying that it has been repurposed.

The passage states: ""ንቕልል ዝበለ ጉዕዞ ምሕዃር፣ ቕልል ዝበለ ምድላው ዘድልዮን ዝኾነ ብማእኸላይ መጠን ብቕዓት ዘለዎ ሰብ ክዘናግዐሉ ዝኽእልን እዩ (Simple day hikes require minimal preparation and can be enjoyed by anyone with moderate fitness).""  This directly links minimal preparation to moderate physical fitness. The other options are incorrect because they don't align with the passage's emphasis on fitness level and preparation.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that in Rogaland and Agder, these areas are called ""hei"" which means treeless land.
*   The passage also describes the plateaus as ""open, treeless expanses"". This implies that these areas are covered with vegetation other than trees, heather being a common type of vegetation found in such landscapes."

The passage explicitly states that ""እቲ ንበረኽቲ ቦታታት ናይ ጎብነይቲ ወቕቲ ኣብ ናይ ህንዲ ክረምቲ ይመረፅ"" which translates to ""The peak tourist season for hill stations is preferred in the Indian winter.""

ሓገዝ እትደሊ ጃልባ ኽትረክቡ እንተ ደሊኹም እንታይ ክተወግዱ ኣለኹም?,"The correct answer is **D: ብናጻ ኣብቲ ጃልባ ዝጉዓዙ ብጾታት ሸለል ምባል (Ignoring people traveling on the boat for free)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of networking and talking to as many people as possible in the marina. Ignoring people, especially those already on boats (even if they're traveling for free), would be counterproductive to that goal. All other choices relate to getting the kind of help you need to find the desired boat.

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes interacting with people: ""ብዙሕ ሰባት ንምዝርራብ ፈትን (try to talk to many people)"". This aligns directly with communicating with sailors (ርክብ ምግባር) to find the boat you're looking for. The passage mentions the marina community and obtaining information, advice, and direction from sailors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ኣብ ትሕቲ ራዳር ምጽናሕ (Staying under the radar):** The passage suggests being proactive and social, not hiding.
*   **C: ንሰባት ጃልባኦም ኸጽርዩ ኸለዉ ጥራይ ቕረብዎም (Only approach people when they are cleaning their boats):** The passage encourages general interaction, not just when people are cleaning.
*   **D: ብናጻ ኣብቲ ጃልባ ዝጉዓዙ ብጾታት ምውጋድ (Avoid boat-mates who travel on the boat for free):** This has nothing to do with finding boats that need help."

* The passage also describes the Hong Kong skyline as a ""ብ ግሁድ ማያት ቪክቶርያ ሃርቦር ዝተሰርሐ ዘብለጭልጭ ቻርት መታወር"" (sparkling chart tower built on the open waters of Victoria Harbor).  To *see* this skyline, you'd need to be *across* Victoria Harbour, which is where Kowloon Waterfront is.

The other options are less suitable:

* **A: ቪክቶርያ ሃርቦር:** Victoria Harbour is the body of water, not a specific viewpoint.
* **B: ሆንግ ኮንግ ፕሮፐር:** This is too general and doesn't specify a viewing location.
* **C: ደሴት ሆንግ ኮንግ:** The passage explicitly says to leave the island to see Hong Kong.

This directly translates to ""Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have a leather support that prevents the horse from falling off when it falls"". Although the exact term ""safety bar"" isn't used, the description clearly points to a safety mechanism that helps prevent a rider's foot from getting stuck. While C relates to stirrups, it doesn't mention mitigating the risk of a stuck foot, and the other options are irrelevant to the question.

Here's why:

The passage states that riders should wear riding boots that are heeled, smooth-soled, and *tapered* at the toe. The tapered toe is the key feature described in the passage that is related to stirrup safety. It reduces the risk of the foot getting caught in the stirrup in the event of a fall, which the passage states is a dangerous outcome if a rider gets stuck during a ride.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that sometimes reviews from past guests are provided, implying it is not always the case. Therefore option A is incorrect.
*   The passage explicitly mentions some networks require additional verification (B), and travelers receive a list of potential hosts in the city they are visiting (C). It also mentions that reviews from previous guests are sometimes provided (D).

Therefore, option A is the only statement that is not consistently stated throughout the text."

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: ዝተለኸፉ ሰባት (Zətellekefu sebat)** (Infected people): While infected people *transmit* the disease, they aren't the *cause* of the spread in the way the passage defines infectious diseases.

The passage explicitly states that phone calls are now made over the internet, which eliminates the need to use a phone company located where you live or are traveling to. This is the key enabler that allows someone to use a phone company outside their local area.

The other options are incorrect based on the passage:

*   **B: ኣብ ከባቢኹም ዝርከብ ናይ ቴለፎን ትካል ምጥቃም** - The passage specifically says you don't need to use a phone company in your location.

*   **D: ናይ PSTN ስልኪ ምግዛእ** - The passage mentions PSTN phones in the context of requiring an international number to receive calls on them, but it doesn't imply buying a PSTN phone is *required* to receive calls in general. The focus is on the number, not the specific type of phone."

*   **P states** that Italian words are relatively easy to pronounce *because most words are pronounced as they are written*. The instruction is that `C` and `G` are exceptions, and there is emphasis placed on `R` and `RR`. This is directly opposite of option D.
*   **A, B, and C** are all statements that align with the prompt's meaning, that Italian is easy to pronounce, and the exceptions which should be paid close attention to.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that a Wild Card is beneficial for someone who plans to visit ""some or all of South Africa's national parks.""

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions being careful when traversing steep areas, especially in remote spots, because it can be dangerous. This implies the potential for slips or falls, which are more likely in slippery conditions. The text also notes that some parts are ""ጸዳፍ"" (slippery).
*   The other options are less directly related to potential danger throughout the entire climb:
    *   B: ናይ እምኒ ኣስካላታት (Stone steps): While steps can be challenging, the text doesn't suggest they are inherently dangerous. They are actually an aid to climbing.
    *   C: ንእሽቶ በዓቲ (Small cave): The cave is described as small and narrow, but not explicitly dangerous. It's only near the top.
    *   D: ናይ ሓጺን ገመዳት (Iron cables): While the text mention hand support in the ""ጸዳፍ"" slippery parts it doesn't say they are made of iron or cables.

*   **B: ኣብ ምሉእ እቲ ጸዳፍ ክፋላት መትሓዚ ኢድ የብሉን:** The text says ""ኣብቲ ዝያዳ ጸዳፍ ክፋላት ናይ ኣቻዮ ኢድ መደገፊ ሓገዝ ይህቡ,"" which means there are handrails in the steeper sections, but not necessarily *all* of them.  This statement is likely the inaccurate one.

*   **C: ኣብ ላዕሊ ብዘሎ በዓቲ ክትሓልፍ ኣለኩም:** The text describes a small cave ""ናብ ኸባቢ ጫፍ እቲ እምባ ክትበፅሑ ከለኹም ብውሽጣ መሕለፊ ዘለዋ ንእሽቶ በዓቲ ኣላ"". This implies you must pass through it to reach the very top. Thus, this statement is accurate.

A simple favorite is ""pa-amb-oli"" which consists of bread with olive oil, tomato, and various accompaniments like cheese or tuna.

Based on this description:

*   **A: ስጋ (Meat)** - Mentioned as a prominent part of the cuisine.
*   **B: ባኒ (Bread)** - Mentioned as a prominent part of the cuisine.
*   **C: እኽሊ (Grain/Cereal)** - Not explicitly mentioned as a primary component like the others. While bread (ባኒ) is made from grains, the passage doesn't emphasize grain itself as a staple.
*   **D: ኣሕምልቲ (Vegetables)** - Mentioned as a prominent part of the cuisine.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: እኽሊ**"

Here's why:

*   The text states that the pit is heated by hot stones from a fire **OR** from naturally hot areas. Geothermal heating uses naturally hot areas, not stones heated by fire.

The other options are true based on the text:

*   **B: ውዑይ ኣእማን ዝጥቀም ሃንጊ ኣብ ዌሊንግተን ይርከብ** - The text mentions pit cooking in Wellington. While it doesn't explicitly state they use hot stones, it's implied that they may.

The passage states that if a woman brings her own head covering, ""ብፍላይ ድማ ደመቕቲ ህብሪታት ዘለዎ እንተኾይኑ (especially if it is brightly colored),"" she is more likely to receive a smile from the priest or nun at the entrance.

*   The passage also mention about men that if they don't wear trousers that cover their knees, they can borrow trousers (ስረ) from the monastery.
*   The passage does not mention about men's head covering being available for borrowing.

Therefore, it is implied that you cannot borrow a መጠቕለሊ from the monastery.

The passage states that bars in small towns are not always good places for visitors to enjoy themselves. It also mentions the issue of drunk driving being prevalent from these small-town bars. Therefore, visitors seeking nightlife entertainment in northern New Mexico should avoid bars in small towns according to the passage.

*   The passage states that casinos (especially those near Albuquerque and Santa Fe) offer name-brand entertainment.

*   **Domestic Beer:** The text describes the domestic beer as ""pleasant and refreshing"" and not ""mixed beer"" and it doesn't seem expensive.

*   The passage specifically states that the concept of a ""ጥፍጡፍ ጻዕዳ (Flat White)"" is foreign to Australians (who are the people from the region being described). This means ordering this would likely cause confusion for a server in that location.

The other options are less likely to cause confusion:

*   **A: ሓጺር ጸሊም (Short Black):** The passage explains that this is simply an ""Espresso"".
*   **B: ቁጽሪ ሓደ (Number One):** The passage describes ""Number One"" as the most popular local beer.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of appearing well-mannered and behaving like a ""bien élevé"" person (well-brought-up).** This suggests that trying to adopt Parisian customs and manners is key to gaining their favor. While the passage mentions negative stereotypes about Parisians, it also states they appreciate seeing someone try to behave correctly according to their standards.
* **The other options are less directly supported by the text:**
    * B: ርእሰ ተኣማንነት ምግዳፍ (Abandoning self-confidence): The passage doesn't suggest giving up self-confidence.
    * C: ትሑት ምዃን (Being humble): While humility is generally a good trait, the passage focuses more on demonstrating proper etiquette than on being humble.

Let's break down the options:

*   **A: ትዕቢት (Haughtiness/Pride)** - This is explicitly mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: ስርዓት ዘይምግባር (Undisciplined)** - This is explicitly mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: ተጸዋታይ ምዃን (Playful/Flirtatious)** - This is not mentioned in the passage. The word translated here as ""passionate"" might have playful connotations, but it is never used in the text itself.
*   **D: ዘይእሩም ምዃን (Unreliable/Unstable)** - Passionate could imply unreliability, but that's not the main point the author is describing.

Thus, the correct answer is **C: ተጸዋታይ ምዃን (Playful/Flirtatious)**, as it is the only option NOT mentioned as a stereotyped trait of Parisians in the passage."

*   **A: እቲ ኮች ኣብ ቅድሚት ባቡር ይርከብ** (The coach is at the front of the train) - While the passage mentions that Metroplus coaches are always near the front, it doesn't necessarily mean it is an advantage. Also, it doesn't state it is *always* at the very front. It could be *near* the front.
*   **C: ካብ ናይ ሳልሳይ ደረጃ ትኬት ዝወሓደ ወጻኢታት ኣለዎ** (It has lower costs than a third-class ticket) - The passage explicitly says Metroplus is *more* expensive.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""ነፍሲ-ወከፍ ባቡር ሜትሮፕላስ ን ሜትሮ ኣሰልጠንቲ ኣለዎም"" This means each Metrorail train has both Metroplus (first class) and Metro (third class) coaches."

*   **D: ኣብ ሳንቲም እናኸፈልካ ዝሰርሕ ስልኪ (At payphones)** - This doesn't make logical sense; you wouldn't buy a phone card *at* a payphone, but rather *use* the card to call *from* a payphone or other phone.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ብጭቡጥ ናይ ክልል ሚስጥራዊ ቑጽርታት ኣብ ምንታይ ይሕግዙ?,"Let's analyze the provided text to find the answer.

The text states: ""ብርግጽ ናይ ክልል ሚስጥራዊ ቑጽርታት ኣብ ዘይሕጋዊ ምቕዳሕ ምንም ለውጢ የብሉን"" which translates to ""In reality, regional secret codes make no difference in illegal copying"".

Based on this statement, we can eliminate the following:

*   **D: ዘይሕጋዊ ምቕዳሕ (Illegal Copying)** - The text explicitly states it *doesn't* help with this.
*   **C: ምክልኻል ሽፍትነት (Preventing Piracy)** - ""Piracy"" is synonymous with ""illegal copying"", therefore is incorrect.

The text also states: ""ኣቲ ዋና ሓቃዊ ዕላማ ነቶም ካምፓንታት ኣብ ልዕሊ ዕዳገኦም ብዙሕ ቁጽጽር ንክገብሩን ኩሉ ብዛዕባ ምሽክርካር ገንዘብ እዩ።"" which translates to ""The main real goal is for the companies to have a lot of control over their markets and it's all about money circulation.""

Based on this statement, we can identify that the code is related to controlling markets, so the answer is:

*   **B: ምቁጽጻር ዕዳጋ (Controlling the Market)**

And we are left with the incorrect answer:

*   **A: ዲስክ ምቕዳሕ (Disk Copying)** - While the text mentions copying, it doesn't say the codes *help* with general disk copying.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: ምቁጽጻር ዕዳጋ**"

The passage explicitly states that media companies are lying when they say ""regional encryption"" (what I'm assuming ""ክልል ሚስጥራዊ ቑጽርታት"" refers to) prevents illegal copying. It says the encryption doesn't change illegal copying at all. The other options are mentioned as the *real* reasons for the companies' actions, not the lies they are spreading.

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes the importance of knowing what you can and cannot bring into the country and declaring items exceeding the legal limit. This aligns directly with option B.
*   While customs checks (option C) are mentioned as potentially tedious, the primary focus is on understanding declaration requirements. Option B is more specific to the advice given.
*   Option A is incorrect because it states that you should know if there is immigration. According to the passage, there should not be an immigration check.
*   Option D is too broad; the passage doesn't say *everything* is prohibited, but rather that you need to be aware of what is and isn't allowed. Option B is about specifically knowing whether you need to declare."

The passage states that climbers are constantly creating new routes ""ካብቲ መወዳእታ ዘይብሉ ዓቕሚታት መንደቑ"" which translates to ""from the endless possibilities of its **walls/cliffs**"".  Therefore, the availability of walls and cliffs is what allows climbers to find new routes.

Therefore, the answer is **A: ስታር ኣልያንስ** (Star Alliance).

ኣየናይ መጎብነይቲ ትካላት እዮም ንግሎባል ራኒንግ ቱርስ ዝተዓወቱ?,"The correct answer is **B: ጎ ራኒኒንግ ቱርስ**.

The passage states that ""Global Running Tours, the successor to Go Running Tours, has dozens of running equipment suppliers across four continents."" Therefore, Go Running Tours helps to connect with dozens of different running equipment companies.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that animals like **ቅጭኔ** (giraffes) have a habit of approaching vehicles.
*   ኣንበሳታት፣ ዓርዕር ነብርታትን ነብርታትን are mentioned as sometimes being elusive and better viewed with binoculars.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""ጉብንይት ንዓበይቲ ጉጅለታት ሕሱር እዩ"" which translates to ""Tours are cheaper for larger groups"". This directly indicates larger groups get discounted prices.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   A: It states you need to join larger groups because tours are cheaper for those groups
*   B: It is a valid option, but option D is better for it being larger.
*   C: It states you need to join larger groups because tours are cheaper for those groups"

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that tours are cheaper for larger groups, specifically groups of 4 to 6 people.
* Forming a group of 4-6 people can help lower the price per person. This directly supports the idea that a group of five (ሓሙሽተ ሰባት ዝሓቖፈ ጉጅለ) would have the best chance of securing a better tour price.

The passage states: ""ብተደጋጋሚ ኣብ ሙዚቃ፣ ፊልሚታት፣ ጽሑፋትን ህዝባዊ ባህልታትን ብምርኣያ እታ ኸተማን ፍሉጣት ቦታታታን ብዓለም ክትፍለጥ ጌሩ እዩ።"" This translates to: ""Being featured frequently in music, films, writings, and popular culture has made the city and its famous places known worldwide.""

Therefore, the frequent appearance in art and media is what the passage identifies as contributing to San Francisco's global recognition.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that tourism contributes to San Francisco's economy, but it also lists other major employment sectors like professional services, government, finance, and trade. It doesn't say the economy *entirely* relies on tourism.

The other options are explicitly supported by the text:

*   A: ኣብ ፊልምታትን መጻሕፍትን ብዙሕ ግዜ ተራእዩ እዩ (Appears often in films and books) - The passage says it appears frequently in music, movies, writings, and popular culture.
*   B: ናይ ኤስያ ምግቢ ይርከብ እዩ (Asian food is available) - The passage mentions Korean, Thai, Indian, and Japanese food specifically.
*   C: ብዙሓት ሆቴላትን ማእከላት ኣኼባታትን ኣለዉ (There are many hotels and meeting centers) - The passage states that San Francisco has developed tourism facilities including many hotels and sophisticated convention halls."

*   **The passage focuses on the benefits of booking in advance** with a travel agent, emphasizing peace of mind and pre-arranged accommodations.
*   An ""ብቕጽበት ናይ ምኻድ ዝንባለ ዘለዎ ተጓዓዛይ"" is an impulsive traveler. Impulsive travelers are unlikely to book in advance, because they make the decision to travel on short notice.
*   The passage explicitly states travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, and can help arrange packages including flights, hotels, and other services. This makes them well-suited for travelers who plan ahead and want pre-arranged deals.

The other options are all potentially good fits for using a travel agent:

*   **A: ንውሳነ ዝሽገር ተጓዓዛይ (Indecisive traveler)** - A travel agent can help them narrow down options and make recommendations.
*   **C: ገና ቪዛኡ ዘየረጋገጸ ተጓዓዛይ (Traveler whose visa is not yet confirmed)** - The passage mentions that travel agents can help with visa documentation.
*   **D: ፓኬጅ ውዕላት ምውሳድ ዝመርጽ ተጓዓዛይ (Traveler who prefers to take package deals)** - The passage explicitly says travel agents offer packages."

While the passage mentions that travel agents *can* help you obtain travel documents like visas, it doesn't present it as a core benefit *of booking accommodation* through a travel agent. The other options are explicitly mentioned as advantages:

*   **B: ናይ ሆቴል ውዕላት (Hotel Agreements)**: The passage mentions travel agents often have agreements with certain hotels.
*   **C: ኩሉ ዘጠቓልል ፓኬጃት (All-inclusive Packages)**: The passage specifically mentions flight and hotel packages.
*   **D: ኣቐዲምካ ቦታ ምሓዝ (Advance Booking)**: The entire passage discusses the benefits of booking accommodation in advance through a travel agent.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ቅጽበታዊ ናይ ጽሑፍ ተርጓሚ ኣፕሊኬሽናት ኣየናይ ክእለት የብሎምን?,"The correct answer is **D: 100% ግዜ ብትኽክል ምትርጓም (Translating correctly 100% of the time)**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that translation engines have improved, but ""some errors are still possible"" and ""some caution is warranted"". This directly contradicts the idea of 100% accuracy.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: ምልክታት ናብ ወጻኢ ቋንቋታት ምትርጓም (Translating signs into foreign languages)**: The passage mentions the ability to translate text on signs or other objects in the real world.
*   **B: ምሉእ ክፍልታት ጽሑፍ ምትርጓም (Translating entire sections of text)**: The passage begins by stating that these apps can translate entire sections of text.
*   **C: ብሞባይል ተሌፎን ኣቢሉ ኣብ ኣቕሑ ዘሎ ጽሑፍ ምትርጓም (Translating text on items via mobile phone)**: The passage mentions using smartphones to translate text on objects in the real world."

The passage states that after downloading the necessary language data, Google Translate allows for offline translation. This directly answers the question of what enables translations to be done without internet access.

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣየናይ እዩ ንበረድ ዝሓወሰ ህቦብላ ወይ ድማ ኣቫላንቺ ዘይቕስቅስ?,"The passage states that the main problem with ice avalanches is the ""sticky nature of the ice,"" meaning it needs a force to move. The passage also states that ""additional ice falls,"" ""sun melting the ice,"" and ""humans"" can trigger avalanches. Therefore, the *stickiness* itself does not *trigger* an avalanche, but is a characteristic that an avalanche *needs to overcome* in order to move.

Therefore, the answer is **A: ተጣባቒ በረድ (Sticky ice)**.
"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣየናይ እዩ ከም በረድ ዝሓወሰ ህቦብላ ወይ ድማ ኣቫላንቺ ዝወርድ?,"The correct answer is **C: ኣብ ዝታሓተ ብራኸ ዘለዎ ቁልቁለት ቦታታት ልዕሊ ዓቐን በረድ**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ቁልቁለት ቦታታት ዝታሓተ ብራኸ ዘለዎን ጥራሕ እዩ ክሕዝ ዝኽእል፤ እዞም ትርፊ በዝሒታት ድማ ብምንሽርታት በረድ እዮም ዝወርዱ."" This directly translates to: ""Slopes with low elevations can only hold so much; these excesses descend as avalanches.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ዘይተበገሰ ተጣባቒ በረድ (Undisrupted cohesive ice)**: While the passage mentions ice's cohesive nature is a problem, it's the *excess* ice exceeding the capacity of the slope that causes the avalanche.
* **B: በረድ ዘይብሉ ዝታሓተ ብራኸ ዘለዎ ቁልቁለት ቦታታት (Low-elevation slopes without ice)**: Avalanches require ice/snow.
* **D: ብደቂ ሰባት ከይተተንከፈ ዝተረፈ በረድ (Ice untouched by humans)**: While humans can *trigger* avalanches, the fundamental cause is the excess of ice.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate reflection of the passage.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the traverse is on compacted snow with crevasses (""ዝተጸቓቐጠ በረድ ኮይኑ ብባንዴራታት ዝተመልአን ምልክት ዝተገብረሉን ጉዳጉዲ ኣለዎ""). Crevasses are dangerous and a reason to take a longer, safer route.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **A: መብዛሕትኡ ግዜ መደበር ማክሙርዶ ዕጹው እዩ:** The passage doesn't mention that McMurdo Station is frequently closed.

*   **C: እተን ፍሉያት ትራክተራት ቅልጡፋት ኣይኮናን:** While the passage says the tractors aren't light and take a long time, this doesn't explain *why* they go around the mountains. Their speed is a consequence, not the reason for the detour.

*   **D: ካብ ብባሕሪ ሮስ ምጉዓዝ ዝቐለለ’ዩ:** The passage does not compare the traverse to traveling by sea and does not mean to imply that travelling by sea is more challenging."

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""ዋላ'ኳ ደቡባዊ ኣፍሪካ ይረጋጋዕ ጎሬቤት ሃገራት ዝተረጋግዓ ከምዘይኮና ክትሓስቡ ይግባእ"" which translates to ""Even though South Africa is stable, you should consider that neighboring countries are not stable."" This directly contradicts option C, which claims the opposite. The other options are all supported by the passage."
ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ንደቡብ ኣፍሪቃ ብመኪና ክድህስሱ ንዝደልዩ በጻሕቲ እንታይ ከም ሕማቕ ምኽሪ ክቑጸር ይኽእል?,"The correct answer is **B: ዋላ እኳ 4x4 እንተተመኸረ፡ መብዛሕትኡ ቦታታት ግን ብንቡር ተሽከርካሪት ክትበጽሑዎም ትኽእሉ ኢኹም** (Even though a 4x4 is recommended, you can reach most places with a normal vehicle).

Here's why:

*   The passage clearly states that while a normal vehicle *can* be used, a 4x4 is *highly recommended*, and many places are *only* accessible with a high-clearance 4x4. Suggesting that *most* places are accessible with a normal vehicle directly contradicts the passage's emphasis on the need for a 4x4. Therefore, this is bad advice for someone wanting to explore South Africa by car.

The other options are supported by the text:

*   A: The passage explicitly mentions that each country has specific legal requirements for emergency equipment in vehicles.
*   C: The passage states that traveling by car is an ""amazing way"" to see the beauty of the region and access places off the beaten path.
*   D: The passage warns that while South Africa is stable, neighboring countries may not be."

*   **B: ብዘይፍላጥኩም ተሸካሚ ሓሽሽ ክትኮኑ ትኽእሉ ኢኹም (You can unknowingly become a drug carrier):** Directly stated in the passage.
*   **D: ሰበስልጣን ከም ሓደጋ ቦምብ ክወስድዎም ይኽእሉ እዮም (Authorities may consider them a bomb threat):** Directly stated in the passage.

The passage does *not* mention bags being confused with other people's bags as a specific risk of leaving them unattended.

ኣብቲ ጥቕሲ ብዛዕባ ምጽዓን ሓሽሽ ዘይተጠቕሰ እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ሓሽሽ ዝሽትቱ ኣኽላባት ብዘይ ምፍላጥ ክጥቀሙ ይኽእሉ (Drug-sniffing dogs can be used unknowingly)**.

Let's break down why:

*   The passage discusses how you can unknowingly be used to transport drugs (""ዓርስኻ ከም መዛወሪ ሃሹሽ እጺ ተተቂሞምካ ክትረኽቦ ትኽእል""). It also mentions that drug-sniffing dogs could search you unexpectedly. However, it does not say that the drug sniffing dogs can be used unknowingly.
*   A is not correct because the passage mentions that some countries have punishments for drug offenses that include the death penalty (""ዝተወሰና ሃገራት ንፋልማይ ጥፍኣት ገበን ... ሞት ዝሓወሰ ብጣዕሚ ዝተጋነነ መቕጻዕቲ ይህባ"").
*   B is not correct because the passage emphasizes being careful when crossing international borders (""ኣህጉራዊ ዶባት ኣብ ትሰግረሉ እዋን"").
*   D is not correct because the passage talks about authorities inspecting your bags (""መስመር ምፅናሕ ምስ መደንዘዚ ዕጸፋርስ ዘጫኑ ከልቢ ብሃንደበት ብዘይመጠንቐቕታ ንክፍትሸካ ዘኸእል"").

Therefore, the only answer not explicitly mentioned in the passage is **C**."

The passage mentions ቡን (Bun - Coffee), ሻሂ (Shahi - Tea), and ጽሟቕ (Tsumuak - Smoothie) as possible drinks to try during a staycation. ቢራ (Bira - Beer) is not mentioned.

The passage specifically suggests, ""እንድሕር ደኣ መስተ ኣብ ዝበዝሐላ ከተማ ትነብር ኮይንካ፣ ብዙሕ ግዜ ናብ ዘይተዘውትሮም እንዳ መስተታት ኪድ. (If you live in a city with a vibrant drinking culture, make time to visit pubs you don't frequent).""  This directly aligns with option C.

The passage states, ""ኣብልዕሊ ቤተ ክርስትያን ግቢ ውሽጢ ብሓደ ሓደ መቃብራት ልeርግቢት ዝስሕብ ናይ እብነ በረድ ቅርጻ ቅርጽታት ኣለዉ."" which translates to ""Inside the churchyard, above some of the graves, are marble sculptures that attract pigeons.""

Therefore, the marble sculptures are **B: ኣብ ቀጽሪ ቤተ ክርስቲያን (In the churchyard)**.

The passage states: ""ንመብዛሕትኦም ሃገራት ንምምሃር ... እንተወሓደ ንትወስዶ ትምህርቲ ዓይነታት ናይ ቀዳማይ ዓመት ወጪ ዓርስካ ንምድጋፍ ናይ ፊይናንሳዊ መርትዖ የድልዮም እዩ."" This clearly indicates that a student visa requires proof of sufficient financial support.
"

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that students require visas for longer stays and student visas have specific requirements. The passage discusses this at length, emphasizing that international students generally need a visa for extended stays, unlike tourists or business travelers on short trips who might be visa-exempt in some cases."
መዓስ ኢኹም ብፍላይ ብዛዕባ ጣንጡ ከተስተብህሉሉ ዘለኹም?,"The correct answer is **A: ኣብ ኣዋርሕ ክረምቲ (In the winter months)**.

The passage specifically mentions being careful of ticks, ""ብፍላይ አብ ክረምቲ (especially in winter)"". While ticks are a concern in forests (C), on hikes (B), and while driving (D), the *specific* time highlighted for concern is winter.

The passage warns that even a short time with the doors open is enough for ants to enter the car. Therefore, leaving the doors open for a long time is what you should avoid.

*   **A: ገለ ካብቶም ዝተረፉ ውሑዳት ሓያላት ጫካታት ዝሓዘ እዩ** The text mentions that Sundarbans contains ""ተረፉ ዝተወሰኑ ብርቱዓት ደው ዝበሉ ጣሻታት,"" which translates to ""some remnants of strong standing forests."" So, this statement is true.

*   **B: ፍርቂ ጠቕላላ ስፍሓቱ ብረግረግ ዝተሸፈነ እዩ** The text states ""እቲ ሲሶ ከዓ ብማይ/ትርኩስ ቦታ ዝተሸፈነ እዩ,"" which translates to ""one-third of it is covered by water/swamp."" This statement is false, as only one-third is covered with water/swamp.

*   **C: ኣብ ዓለም እቲ ዝዓበየ ቀበቶ መንገሮቭ እዩ** The text states ""ሳንዳርባን ኣብ ዓለም እቲ ዝዓበየ ኣብ ገምገም ባሕሪ ዝቦቅል ዕጥቂ ሾራ እዩ,"" which translates to ""Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world."" This statement is true.

*   **D: ካብ ነብሪ ቤንጋል ንላዕሊ ንጣብ ዘለዎም ዓገዘት ዝነብሩላ እያ** The text states that the Sundarbans are home to ""ክሳብ 400 ናይ ቤንጋል ሮያል ነብርታትን ከባቢ 30,000 ዝፍለጡ ዓጋዘንን ኣለው,"" which means ""approximately 400 Bengal Royal tigers and around 30,000 known crocodiles."" This statement is true, as there are significantly more crocodiles than tigers.

Therefore, the false statement is **B: ፍርቂ ጠቕላላ ስፍሓቱ ብረግረግ ዝተሸፈነ እዩ**."
ኣየናይ ክፋል ጫካ እዩ ኣብ ውሽጢ መሬት ህንዲ ዝርከብ?,"The correct answer is **A: ሳንዳርባንስ ሃገራዊ ፓርክ** (Sundarbans National Park).

The passage states: ""ብግዝኣት ህንዲ ዘሎ ክፋል ዱር ሳንዳርባንስ ሃገራዊ ፓርክ ተባሂሉ ይጽዋዕ"" which translates to ""The part of the forest that is within the state of India is called Sundarbans National Park.""

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically mentions that even though many people in the region speak English, they might have limited knowledge, especially in smaller communities.
*   The example of people from different places (Manukunyani, Bostanawi, Jamaican, and Sydneya) arguing at a dinner table, using their unique local vocabulary and word formations, illustrates how **dialects can be difficult to understand.**
*   While the passage mentions the difficulty of pronouncing proper addresses, it's the example of the dinner conversation highlighting the diverse dialects that makes option A the most fitting.

Therefore, the primary challenge in understanding the spoken language described in the passage comes from the unique dialects used by different communities."

*   **A: እቲ ተጓዓዛይ ናብ ጃካር ዝኸይድ ኮይኑ፡ ኣቐዲሙ ትኬት ገዚኡ ኣሎ** - The text says buses to Jakar/Bumthang leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM, and it's *best* to buy tickets in advance for inter-district buses due to them often being full. So, going to Jakar and having pre-bought a ticket is definitely a comfortable situation.

*   **B: እቲ ተጓዓዛይ ናብ ቡምታንግ ይኸይድ ስለዘሎ ክሳብ ሰዓት 7 ኣብ ዘሎ ክብገስ ኣለዎ** - The text says buses to Bumthang leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM, so leaving by 7 AM is *necessary* but not necessarily the most comfortable situation. They may not get a seat if the bus is full if they do not purchase their ticket beforehand.

*   **C: እቲ ተጓዓዛይ ናብ ፓሮ ይኸይድ ስለዘሎ ድሕሪ ሰዓት 11 ክብገስ ኣለዎ** - The text mentions shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places like Paro. The time of departure is not mentioned.

*   **D: እቲ ተጓዓዛይ ንምብራቕ ገጹ ይኸይድ ኣሎ፡ ቅድሚ ሰዓት 6፡20 ድማ ኣብቲ መደበር ይበጽሕ** - The text says buses to the East leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM. Arriving before 6:20 AM is not necessary.

**Therefore, the best answer is A.** Having a pre-bought ticket for a bus to Jakar ensures a smoother and more comfortable travel experience.

**B: ኣቐዲምኩም ትኬት ምግዛእ (Buy tickets in advance)**

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Since the inter-regional buses are mostly full, it is better to buy your ticket a few days in advance."" This is direct advice about securing a seat on the bus.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best advice:

*   **A: ኣውቶቡሳት ድሕሪ ሰዓት 8፡30 ጥራይ እየን ዝብገሳ (Buses only depart after 8:30)** The text indicates that buses, especially those going east, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
*   **C: ብዙሓት ኣውቶቡሳት ምሉእ መዓልቲ እየን ዝብገሳ (Many buses depart all day)** While buses run throughout the day, the important point for someone travelling *east* is that they should aim for the 06:30 - 07:30 departures. Knowing they run all day isn't as critical as knowing to book ahead.
*   **D: ናይ ሓባር ታክሲ እቲ ዝበለጸ በሊሕ መገሻ ክኸውን ይኽእል እዩ (Shared taxi may be the best efficient travel)** Shared taxis are suggested for *nearby* destinations like Paro and Punakha. The question asks about traveling east *from the inter-district bus station*, implying a longer journey where a bus is more likely to be suitable.

The passage states that Timbuktu *does* have an airport (""መዕርፎ ኣየር እንተሃለዋን""). Therefore, option C is the incorrect statement about Timbuktu. The other options are directly supported by the text.
"

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""ሎሚ ቲምቡክቱ ዋላ'ኳ ዘለዋ ዝና ናይ ቱሪዝም ማእኸል እንተገበራን መዕርፎ ኣየር እንተሃለዋን... (Today, even though Timbuktu has a reputation as a tourist center and has an airport...)"" This directly confirms that the city has an airport and is reachable by airplane.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   B: ካብ ድኽነት ንላዕሊ ፍሉይ እዩ (It is more unique than poverty): The passage explicitly states that Timbuktu is a ""ድኽነት ዝተጎናጸፈት ከተማ እያ (poverty-stricken city)."" This contradicts the statement.
*   C: ካብ ኣብ ከባቢኣ ዝርከባ ከተማታት ዝወሓደ ኣፍሪቃዊ ጣዕሚ ኣለዋ (It has less African flavor than the surrounding cities): The passage states: ""እታ ከተማ ካብ ኣፍሪካውያን ንላዕሊ ብዙሓት ናይ ዓረብ ክኢላታት ስለ ዘለውዋ ምስተን ካልኦት ከተማታት እንትነፃፀር ኣዝያ ፍልይ ዝበለት እያ (The city is very different compared to the other cities because it has many Arab experts more than Africans)."" While it's implied it is different, it doesn't directly state there is less African flavor.
*   D: እታ ከተማ ድሕሪ ሕጂ በጻሕቲ ኣይትስሕብን (The city no longer attracts visitors): The passage mentions that even though it has an airport, its reputation is still that of a tourist center. It does not say tourism has stopped.

Therefore, only option A is explicitly confirmed by the provided text."
ናይ ሓጋይ ኦሎምፒክ ፈለማ ንመዓስ እዩ ተሓሲቡ ነይሩ? ,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: ሓምለ 2020**.

The passage states ""...ከምኡ ከኣ መሬት ምስ ነክኡ “ህቦብላ ንፋስ” ይኾኑ (and when they touch the ground, they become 'ህቦብላ ንፋስ' (tornadoes)).""
"

**None of the above.** All the options describe properties of tornadoes.

*   The passage states that governmental travel advisories may be too broad and not specific enough to the traveler's individual circumstances.
*   It also states that advisories from your own government may be tailored to their own citizens.
*   Therefore, getting advice from citizens within the country the traveler is visiting would provide a more nuanced and relevant perspective on the political situation."
ናይ ጉዕዞ ምኽሪ ኣብ ዝህልወሉ እዋን፡ ሓደ ወጻእተኛ ዜጋ ከጋጥሞ ዘይክእል እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **D: ንፖለቲካዊ ኩነታት እታ ሃገር ብዝምልከት ዝርዝር ሓበሬታ (Detailed information regarding the political situation of the country).**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""መማኸሪቲ ብዛዕባ እቲ ኣብ ሓንቲ ሃገር ዘሎ ፖለቲካዊ ዅነታት ኣሕጽር ኣቢሉም ጥራይ እዩ ዚገልጹ."" This directly translates to ""Advisories only briefly describe the political situation in a country."" It further elaborates that the advice is often hasty, general, and brief when compared to detailed information available elsewhere.
* **The question asks:** What is something a foreign citizen is *unlikely* to encounter when travel advisories are in place?

Therefore, because the passage says the advisories provide a *brief* overview, a foreign citizen is unlikely to encounter *detailed* information about the political situation from travel advisories.

The other options are incorrect because the passage explicitly states that travel advisories *can* affect insurance and health coverage and that the summaries of political situations are simplified.

*   Understanding nature, language, or low-income countries.
*   Finding good options for complex trips.
*   Handling specialized areas like budget travel or specific destinations.
*   Booking recurring trips with similar itineraries.

Therefore, a travel agent's help would be **least** needed for a trip to a city the traveler has been to before, especially for something straightforward like a business conference.

So the answer is **A**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that travel agents often have experience with destinations, languages, or countries with low incomes *before* the traveler. This suggests their expertise is most valuable when the traveler is unfamiliar with the destination, such as with a novel or unique trip.
*   The passage also says that agents can specialize in certain types of trips or budgets. This implies that they're particularly helpful when the trip is unusual or requires specialized knowledge.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A:** booking round trip flights isn't necessarily a situation where a travel agent's specialized knowledge is needed.
*   **C & D:** The passage indicates that travel agents are especially helpful when the traveler doesn't know the language or cultural differences of a place. So if the traveler knows these things, they might not need the agent as much."

The passage emphasizes that things will be different when traveling and that frustration can arise from expecting the new place to operate like home. Therefore, *not* expecting things to be the same (option A's opposite) is what will help prevent discouragement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ዘይትፈልጦም መግብታት ክትፍትን ድልውነት:** While trying new foods might be a fun part of travel, it's not the core advice for avoiding discouragement due to cultural differences.
*   **C: ነቲ ሕጊ ልክዕ ከምቲ ዝመጽሉ ከባቢ ምስዓብ:** The passage states that laws are different and it's important to be aware of that, so this is not accurate.
*   **D: ኣቐዲምካ ኣብ መዕረፊ ቦታታት ዝምልከት ዝግበር መጽናዕቲ ምውጋድ:** Doing research can help mitigate frustration, avoiding research can lead to disappointment."

**Reasoning:**

* The passage emphasizes that when traveling, things will be different from your home environment (customs, laws, food, etc.).
* It warns against frustration and disliking things simply because they are different.
* Someone with a ""closed mind"" is less likely to be accepting of these differences and more prone to frustration and disappointment when things aren't the way they expect them to be.
* The other options:
    * **A: ፍሉይ መግቢ ዝፈቱ ሰብ** (A person who likes special food) - While food differences can be a challenge, it doesn't necessarily lead to despair unless the person is extremely rigid in their diet.
    * **B: ለውጢ ዝፈቱ ሰብ** (A person who likes change) - Someone who enjoys change would likely adapt well to a new environment.
    * **D: ትምህርቲ ዘሐጉሶ ሰብ** (A person who likes education) - Such a person would enjoy learning the different ways of life."

Here's why:

*   The passage advises to enjoy your first few days by staying in a nice hotel and eating good food to ease the culture shock. Therefore, refraining from eating a lot of food (option B) is *not* recommended.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኣብ መሬት ቅድሚ ምድቃስኩም እንስሳታት እቲ ከባቢ ፍለጡ** - This is in line with the passage's advice to be aware of local animals before sleeping on the ground to avoid being bitten/attacked.
*   **C: ካምፕ ትገብሩ እንተኾይንኩም ዓራት ወይ ሃሞክ ምሓዝ ይምከር** - This is directly mentioned as a way to protect yourself from snakes and other creatures if you are camping.
*   **D: መጀመርታ ኣብ ዝመጻእኹሉ እዋን ኣብ ጽሬት ዘለዎ ሆቴል መዕራፍ** - This is explicitly suggested in the passage to make the initial adjustment easier."

*   The passage mentions:
    *   ""ምዕራባውያን ስታይል ከምኡውን ደረጅኡ ዝሓለወ ሆቴላት (Western-style and well-maintained hotels)"" - Supports **D: ጽሬት ዘለዎም ሆቴላት (Clean hotels)**.
    *   ""ፅቡቅ መግቢ ብምክያድ (Eating good food)""- Supports **A: ምዕራባውያን ቅዲ ዘለዎ መግቢ (Western-style food)**

This implies avoiding sleeping directly on the ground, suggesting the need for a sleeping pad, which makes **C: ካምፕ ንምግባር ዝኸውን ፍራሽ ወይ ፓድ (Mattress or pad for camping)** a relevant point

*   The passage does not directly mention a need to look for a **""ጽሬት ዘለዎ ኣገልግሎት (Clean service).""** It talks about clean hotels and good food to ease the transition into a developing country.

Let's analyze the other options:

*   **A (ንሓደ ብጻይ መገሻ ቅዳሕ ምሃብ):** While this is a good idea in general, it doesn't guarantee the policy owner will have access. What if they are separated from their travel companion?

*   **B (ንባዕሎም ቅዳሕ ብኢመይል ምልኣኽ):** This requires internet access to retrieve the email, which the person might not have.

*   **D (ቅዳሕ ኣብ “ክላውድ” ምኽዛን):** This also requires internet access.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that being exposed to the germs in your own home means you are less likely to be infected by them. This implies regular exposure to local germs builds some level of immunity or tolerance. The passage then discusses digestive issues, and respiratory issues from bacteria.

Let me know if you have any other questions."

Looking at the answer choices:

*   A: Repetitive visa requests are avoided - **CORRECT**
*   B: Money is saved - **CORRECT**
*   C: Many passport control locations are avoided - **CORRECT**
*   D: A passport is not necessary - **INCORRECT**. The passage says you can cross borders without *identity checks and checkpoints*, it doesn't say you don't need a passport at all.

Therefore, the best answer is **A, B, and C.** The question is a bit tricky because it doesn't specify ""single best"" but based on the passage, all three are correct.

**Assuming the question implies picking only one best answer**, then C is the most encompassing as the main advantage of Schengen is about the easier border crossing which avoids checkpoints including passport control. A and B are results of this easier system.

However, I would push back on this question as all the options except D are explicitly mentioned as benefits in the text."

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states ""Whistler, while expensive..."" This indicates that Whistler is the least attractive option for budget-conscious travelers compared to the other locations, based on the passage.

*   The passage explicitly states that Bowen Island offers ""a real community"" experience outside of Vancouver. It highlights its accessibility, activities (kayaking, hiking, shops, restaurants), and suitability for day or weekend trips.

*   While Whistler is mentioned, it's described as a more expensive option and primarily known for skiing and cycling. It doesn't necessarily offer the same ""real community"" vibe or easy accessibility to Vancouver emphasized in the question.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ድሮን (ሰብ ኣልቦ ነፋሪት) ንፊልም ክትጥቀሙሉ ከለኹም፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣየናይ እዩ ዘይምከር?,"The correct answer is **D: እታ ድሮን(ሰብ ኣልቦ ነፋሪት) ኣብ ዘይትረኣየሉ ጽዑቕ ቦታታት ጥራይ ምቕራጽ (That the drone (unmanned aerial vehicle) should only be filmed in busy places where it is not seen)**

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states: ""ዋላ እኳ አብ ከባቢኹም ክልክል እንተዘይኮነ ሰብ አብ ዝበዝሓሉ ቦታ...ድሮን ምብራር ፅቡቅ ሓሳብ አይኮነን።"" which translates to ""Even if it is not prohibited in your area, it is not a good idea to fly a drone in crowded places...""

The other options are actually recommended by the text:

* **A: እንታይ ክትስእል ከም እትፍቀደልኩም ኣቐዲምኩም ምፍታሽ (Checking in advance what you are allowed to shoot)** This is directly stated: ""ፊልም ንምልዓል እንታይ ከምዝፈቐድካን ኣቐዲምካ ብደምቢ ኣረጋግጽ (Check in advance what you are allowed to film).""
* **B: ተወሳኺ ፍቓድ ምርካብ (Obtaining additional permission)** This is implied by ""እንታይ ዓይነት ፍቓድ ከምዘድልን ኣቐዲምካ ብደምቢ ኣረጋግጽ (Check in advance what kind of permission is required)"".
* **C: ፍቓድ ምምርማር (Examining permission)** This aligns with the overall message of verifying what's allowed.

Therefore, the only option that the passage advises *against* is filming in crowded places.
"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ድሮን(ሰብ ኣልቦ ነፋሪት) ተጠቒምኩም ቪድዮ ንምቕራጽ ዝበለጹ ቦታታት ኣበይ እዮም?,"The best answer is **D: ኣብ’ቶም ኣቐዲምኩም ፍቓድ ዝረኸብኩምሎም ከባቢታት (In the areas where you have already obtained permission)**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes obtaining permission and adhering to regulations.** It explicitly says to ""check what you are allowed to film and what kind of permit you need beforehand."" This makes option D the most aligned with the overall message.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: ኣብ ጥቓ’ቲ ብህላወ ናይ’ታ ድሮን(ሰብ ኣልቦ ነፋሪት) ዘይርበሽ ህዝቢ (Near the public who are not disturbed by the presence of the drone)** While avoiding disturbing the public is important, the passage also focuses on legality. Just because people aren't disturbed doesn't mean it's legal to film there.
* **B: ስሩዕ ፎቶ ግራፍ ምልዓል ኣብ ዘይፍቀደሉ ከባቢታት (In areas where regular photography is not allowed)** This is the opposite of what the passage implies. If photography is restricted, video recording is likely restricted too.
* **C: ኣብ እታ ሰብ ኣልቦ ነፋሪት ብዙሕ ዘይትርአ ጽዑቕ ቦታታት (Dense places where the drone is not very visible)** This is dangerous and irresponsible. The passage warns against flying drones in crowded areas.

Therefore, option D is the most appropriate based on the information provided in the passage.

The passage states ""ብዙሓት ናይ ሰናይ ፍቓድ ስራሕቲ ክፍልን ሰሌዳን ስለዝወሃቡ... ኣብ ሓደ ቦታ ንነዊሕ ግዘ ንምጽናሕን በጀት ንምንዋሕን ጽቡቕ መንገዲ ክኸውን ይኽእል እዩ"" (Many volunteer opportunities offer room and board... and can be a good way to stay in a place for a long time and stretch your budget). This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ዳርጋ ኩሉ ግዜ ደሞዝ ይወሃብ (Almost always paid a salary)**: The passage states ""ውሑዳት ድማ ንኡሽተይ ደሞዝ ስለዝኸፍሉ"" (few pay a small salary), implying that salaries are not common.
*   **B: መብዛሕትኡ ግዜ ናብ ዕድላት ስራሕ ይመርሕ (Often leads to job opportunities)**: The passage doesn't mention that volunteer work leads to job opportunities. It focuses on the benefits during the trip itself.
*   **D: ናይ ኣረኣእያ ስምዒት ንኽህልወኩም ክሕግዝ ይኽእል እዩ (It can help you to have a sense of perspective)**: While the passage does mention gaining perspective as a benefit of volunteering abroad, it doesn't directly address how this *specifically* benefits a traveler on a budget. The room and board is the more direct financial benefit discussed."

*   Flying into Orlando.
*   Driving to a Disney hotel (on-site).
*   Spending about a week buying Disney merchandise.
*   Visiting the parks (implied by the multi-day park hopper tickets mentioned later).

The correct answer is **A**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that boiling time varies depending on the location, implying that specific concerns are important.
* The passage recommends considering bottled water only ""if you are concerned,"" which again highlights assessing concerns.
* Boiling for a minute or several minutes are specific solutions, but not a general, universally ""best"" option.
* Buying bottled water is suggested as a solution *if* there are concerns.

Therefore, understanding the specific risks associated with the water is the most fundamental first step.

The passage actually advises the opposite: to ALWAYS say you are married, regardless of your actual marital status. The other options are all supported by the text:

*   **B:** The passage explicitly mentions that women should be aware that some behaviors might seem like sexual harassment but are normal cultural practices.
*   **C:** The passage advises against wearing expensive jewelry ( implying avoidance of flashy items).
*   **D:** The passage encourages women to be assertive when needed and not afraid to stand their ground.

Here's why:

*   **A:** The passage advises women to be aware that some behaviors might seem like sexual harassment due to cultural differences, but it *doesn't* say that being followed is necessarily normal. Therefore, rejecting this in unwanted circumstance is the right move.
*   **B:** The passage specifically advises *against* wearing a very expensive ring.
*   **C:** While understanding cultural differences is important, the passage emphasizes standing your ground and not being afraid to disagree. This option could be interpreted as suggesting tolerance of unwanted advances because of cultural differences, which contradicts the overall message.
*   **D:** This directly aligns with the advice to stand your ground and not be afraid to disagree, even if it's a cultural difference. It empowers women to firmly reject unwanted advances.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""ዘገዳማዊ እንስሳ ፎቶግራፍ ዘልዕሉ ብዙሕ ጊዜ ነዊሕ ተሌፎቶ ሌንስ ይደልዩ (Those who photograph wild animals often need a long telephoto lens).""
*   The passage also mentions ""እንስሳታት ዘገዳም ሓፋራት ወይ'ውን ተንኮለኛታት ክኾኑ ይኽእሉ እዮም (Wild animals can be shy or cunning).""

Therefore, the combination of needing a long telephoto lens and the animals being shy indicates that shy animals are a key reason for needing special lenses (specifically telephoto lenses) in wildlife photography.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: ብፍላይ ንኣሽቱ ፍጡራት ፎቶ ዘልዕሉ እንተኾይኖም (Especially if photographing small creatures)**: The passage mentions that other lenses may be needed for small creatures, not necessarily a long telephoto lens.
*   **B: እቶም ፎቶ ንንግዳዊ ዕላማ ዝውዕሉ እንተኾይኖም (If the photos are used for commercial purposes)**: This relates to regulations and permission, not necessarily the type of lens needed.
*   **D: ሓደ ፓርክ ብዛዕባ ፎቶ መልዓሊ ንዱር ሂወት ፍሉይ ሕግታት እንተሃልይዎ (If a park has special rules about wildlife photography)**: This also relates to regulations, not lens choice."

*   **B: ምስ ዕጡቓት እንስሳታት ምግጣም (Encountering armed animals)**: The passage doesn't say animals are armed, rather it says ""እንስሳታት ዘገዳም ሓፋራት ወይ'ውን ተንኮለኛታት ክኾኑ ይኽእሉ እዮም (wild animals can be shy or cunning)"".
*   **D: ኣብ ተጻባኢ ክኸውን ዝኽእል ሃዋህው ምስራሕ (working in a potentially hostile environment)**: The passage states ""እቲ ኣከባቢ ዝሑል፣ ውዑይ ካብኡተረፈ ገርጫው ክከውን ይክእል እዩ (The environment can be cold, hot or even dusty)"".

The passage discusses the difficulty of finding specific animals and working in difficult environments, but it doesn't mention any challenges related to finding the lenses themselves."

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: ትሑት ፍሕፍሐ (Tḥut fiḥfiḥa) - Low Traction**. This directly relates to the dangers described in the passage. The other options are also negative, but low traction is the *most* directly problematic for a driver on a mountain pass.

*   **Structures:** ""ናይ ኣታዊ ቐረጽ ኣብ ዝተፈላለዩ ሃገራት ዝተፈላለየ ቕርጺ ኣለዎ"" (Income tax has different forms in different countries.)
*   **Brackets:** ""ምድብን ካብ ክሊ ናብ ክሊ ክፈላለዩ ይኽእሉ"" (Brackets/categories can vary from region to region.) which implies income tax bracket ranges differ.

It doesn't directly discuss where you file your taxes. Therefore:

*   **A: Rates** - Correct, as the passage mentions varying income tax rates.
*   **B: Structures** - Correct, as the passage mentions varying income tax structures.
*   **C: Filing Location** - Incorrect, the passage doesn't explicitly talk about where to file.
*   **D: Brackets** - Correct, as the passage mentions varying income tax brackets.

Considering all information, the best answer should include rates, structures, and brackets. Since we have to pick only one, ""B: Structures"" is the most encompassing. The structure includes the rate and the brackets, so ""B"" is better than ""A"" or ""D"" alone.

So the best single answer is:

*   **P** states that world expositions (World Fairs) feature ""artistic and educational exhibits"" presented by participating countries to showcase their culture, history, or to address global themes.
*   **P** then separately describes ""International Horticultural Expositions"" as flower shows and displays of plants/gardens. This indicates that Horticultural Expositions are *distinct* from the broader World Fairs, although a country *could* choose to feature a horticultural display *within* their main exhibition at a world fair. The two are not presented as routinely coinciding at the event itself.

The other options are accurate descriptions of World Fairs based on the provided text:

*   **A** is correct because the passage mentions that participating countries may show their culture or history in their exhibits.
*   **C** is correct because the passage says the events typically last from three to six months.

This translates to: ""Although in theory, they can be held annually (as long as it is in different countries), in practice they are not."" This means one country cannot host it every year.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: ምርኢታት ታሪኽ ሓንቲ ሃገርን ጉዳያት ዓለምን ዘርኢ ክኸውን ኣለዎ** - The passage says participating countries use expositions to showcase their culture, history, or address global issues, but doesn't state it *must* include both.

Keeping the campsite clean minimizes scents that attract animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ምኡዝ ሽታ ዘለዎ ዕሸል ምሓዝ (Holding a baby with a pleasant smell)**: The passage warns against strong scents.
*   **C: ካብ ኣዛብእ ናይ 25 ሜትሮ ርሕቀት ምሕላው (Keeping a distance of 25 meters from wolves)**: The passage states ""ካብ ድቢታትን ካብ ዎኻሩን እንተንኣሰ 100 ያርድ/ሜትር ንኹሎም ኻልኦት ናይ ዱር እንስሳት 25 ያርድ/ሜትር ርሓቑ!

*   **D: ምስ ሰብ ዘይቀራረቡ እንስሳታት (Animals not used to people):** Although it mentions that some animals inside the park are used to seeing people, it's more about the animals, whether they are used to people or not, being wild and potentially dangerous. The emphasis is on respecting their space and not provoking them, regardless of their familiarity with humans.
