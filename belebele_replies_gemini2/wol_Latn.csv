"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan la ñu mënuta jàppe ni ap tektal bu leer ngir mëna joolil bu baax akorjon bi?","The passage P emphasizes the following points for playing the accordion well:

1.  **Avoid unnecessary movements:** ""Bul jeema def yeneen yu si bokkul ak say baaraam."" (Don't try to do other things that aren't related to your fingers.)  This implies minimizing extra movements.
2.  **Don't press the buttons too hard:** ""Bul leen fatte ni jarul ngeen di bës ci bitoŋ yi bu baax ngir yokk xumbaay bi melni ku nekk ci piyaano."" (Don't forget that you don't need to press the buttons hard to increase the volume like on a piano.) This means using appropriate pressure and not overexerting.
3.  **Increase pressure or speed for volume:** ""Ci akordewon bi, ngir mu gëna foor, dangay jëfandikoo mbiip bi bës ko bu baaax wala nga yokk gaaawaay bi."" (On the accordion, to make it louder, you use the bellows and press them hard or you increase the speed.)

Now let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Ngir yokkinu baat bi, yokkal doole gi ngay jëfëndikoo ngir door poñ yi (To increase volume, increase the force you use to hit the buttons)**  This contradicts the advice in the passage about not pressing buttons too hard. While increased force on the bellows is mentioned, it's distinct from pressing the buttons.

*   **B: Wàññil yëngëtu yu amul solo yi ngir sàmm sa dooleb muñ (Reduce unnecessary movements to save your endurance)** This aligns with the advice to avoid movements not related to the fingers and, more generally, with efficient playing.

*   **C: Xalaatal ci di door poñ yi fekk nga teye ap loxo bu woyof (Think about hitting the buttons while keeping a relaxed hand)** The passage doesn't specifically talk about a relaxed hand.

*   **D: Yokkal gaawaay bi ngay jëfendikoo ngir ëfukaay yi ngir amaat yokkinu baat (Increase the speed you use for the bellows to obtain an increase in volume)** This aligns with the advice about increasing speed.

Therefore, option B and D are the most directly supported by the passage. However, the question asks for *one* answer. Between B and D, **B is a more general and fundamental principle of efficient accordion playing based on the text.** The statement on not pressing the buttons too hard is related to efficiency. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

**Correct Answer: B**
"
"Boy suwé okarjon bi, yan ci yii toop ñooy lay dimbali ngir nga yokk baat bi?","Based on the provided text (P), the correct answer is **B: Doole bu gëna bare**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ci akordewon bi, ngir mu gëna foor, dangay jëfandikoo mbiip bi bës ko bu baaax...""  This translates to: ""On the accordion, to make it louder, you use the bellows and press them hard...""  Pressing the bellows hard implies applying more force.
"
Lu tax nataal yi ci tele bi am seeniy cat yu ñu dagg?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngir nataal bi fees xoolukaay bi yëpp**.

The passage explains that overscanning is done to ensure the image fills the entire screen.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci jafe jafe yii la kenn mëna jankonteel buy wëlbëti ap film ci melokaanu DVD?","Correct Answer: **D: Ay boor yu ñu dagg**

Explanation: The passage states that when converting a DVD, the borders get cropped (dàgg), and this is due to overscan. While the passage mentions subtitles might be cut off (mbind firi jóge ci suuf duñuleeen wone), the primary problem identified is the cropping of the borders. So, option D is the most directly supported answer.
"
Fan la xarekat angalé yi nekkoon?,"The correct answer is **C: Bordentown**.

The text states: ""Seneraal John Cadwalder dina tambali ab congu tooñ ci garnison bu Angalteer ca Bordentown..."" which translates to ""General John Cadwalder will begin an attack on the English garrison at Bordentown..."" This clearly indicates that the English soldiers were stationed at Bordentown.
"
Kan la màndargaam feeñ ci kayit bu ñu bind?,"The correct answer is **D: Charles Thomson**.

The passage states: ""Ginnaw biko Congress bi nango ci wéru sulé gnenti fan, John Hancock njiitu congress bi xaatim nako ci loxom ak **Charles Thomson yonni woonanguko ci kanam ci keer John Dunlap**."" This indicates that Charles Thomson sent the document forward to John Dunlap for printing. This means his name appeared on the printed document (the broadside) in some way.
"
"Ban ci barab ñuy lim, ban la ici Dunlap broadside yi mujjee yegg?","The correct answer is **C: Londre**.

The passage states: ""Ben sotti demna London weeru Ut 10"" which means ""One copy went to London in August 10.""
"
Fan la xarekatu Kolonel Stark yi nekkoon?,"The correct answer is **A: Ci njeexteel bët gànnaar, ci guddaayu miir bi**.

The passage states: ""Niti Stark yi ñu ngi taxaw ci wetu ñagg bi féete bëj gànnaaru Colon bi."" and the subsequent sentence describes the location relative to the Mystic River. This translates to Stark's men standing on the side of the fence facing the northern shore of Colon and beside the short stone wall at the end of the river. Therefore the answer is A.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kañ la gooru Stark yi yaatal seen miir?","The correct answer is **C: Ci waxtu bu géej gi waccee**.

The text states: ""Bi géej gi wàccee ubbi benn yoon ci Mystic River ci booru Peninsul bu bët gannaar, dañuy yokk ñag bi ak miiiru xeer bu gàtt ci cat bi ndox mi jeexee ci ab tefes gu yaatuwul."" This translates to: ""When the tide receded, opening a path on the Mystic River on the north side of the Peninsula, they increased the fence and a short stone wall at the base where the water ended on a narrow shore.""
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop moo doon benn ci jàmono yu gëna meti yu Chine?","The correct answer is **D: Jàmono Ñeeti Nguur ya**.

The text explicitly states that the Three Kingdoms period was the most turbulent and violent period in ancient Chinese history.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan moo dëggu ci mbooloop xarekat mel ni melentaan di dugg ci ap waxtu fu ñu amulee dëkkuwaay?","The passage P describes the behavior of migratory ants (Sànxaleñ). Let's analyze each option in relation to what the passage says about them:

*   **A: Dañuy nekk ci taag bu waxtu guddi jote (They are in groups at night)** - This is consistent with the passage: ""larme bëgg suukar dafay dox guddi te noppalu ci bëccëg ji"" (The sugar loving army moves at night and rests during the day.) This implies they are active in groups at night.

*   **B: Amu ñu lekk bu doy (They don't have enough to eat)** - The passage states: ""Mboolo bi tàmbalina tukki bi lékk gi tambalé wañéeku."" (The group starts to travel when the food starts to decrease). This indicates that food scarcity is a *reason* for their migration, but it doesn't necessarily mean they don't have *enough* to eat *during* the entire migration. It just means their food source in one place is dwindling.

*   **C: Dañuy defar ay taag yu ñuy soopi bu 17 bës rombee (They form groups that they change every 17 days)** - The passage states: ""Saccage wala yeegukaay nomades yii mën nañu yagg ba lu mat fukki fann ak juróom ñaar."" (These nomadic raids or migrations can last up to 57 days). It also mentions that their ""tagguk ndegeeniku yuy soppéeku bés bu né"" (formations and structures change daily). The number 17 is not mentioned.

*   **D: Dañuy dox waxtu bëcëk (They walk during the day)** - This is directly contradicted by the passage: ""larme bëgg suukar dafay dox guddi te noppalu ci bëccëg ji"" (The sugar loving army moves at night and rests during the day).

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided passage is **A**.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban kàddu mooy wone bu baax nu xarekat yi mel ni ay melentaan tàmmee taag yi ci waxtu bu ñu amulee dëkkuwaay?","The correct answer is **C: Dañuy soopi taag yi bës bu nekk**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ci tukki gi, dañuy def ay tagguk ndegeeniku yuy soppéeku bés bu né.""  This directly translates to ""During the journey, they make arrangements and departures that change every day."" Therefore, they are changing their arrangements or ""taag"" daily.

Let's look at why the other options are not as good:

* **A: Dañuy defar ay taag waxtu guddi gi:**  While the passage mentions they are more active at night, it doesn't specifically say they *make* arrangements only at night.
* **B: Dañuy dox 17 fan te du ñu defar taag:** The passage states the migrations can last up to 75 days. While they are nomadic, it is not that they do not make taag.
* **D: Dañuy wéy di jëfëndikoo taag yu ñu am ngir diirub xare gi:** This contradicts the statement that their arrangements/departures change daily.
"
Ban ci yii toop ñooy wéyi moone téewaayu nataal yi ci biti?,"The correct answer is **A: Ay siikal endogene.**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes ""montaru biologie"" (biological clocks) as oscillators that maintain their own rhythm independent of external cues.** These clocks are responsible for periodic rhythms that *aren't* just responses to external signals. The term for these internally generated rhythms is ""siikal endogene."" The phrase is a translation from the French word ""cycles endogènes"", which translates to endogenous cycles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ay yëngëtu yeenisaay (Unicellular movements):** While rhythms can occur in single-celled organisms, this option doesn't specifically address the internally generated nature of the rhythm.
* **C: Montaru yaram gi (The body clock):** This is a related term and very close in meaning. The passage describes montaru biologie as responsible for biological rythms, but the question refers to ""ay siikal endogene"" which translates to ""endogenous cycles"" which is the most direct match to the question.
* **D: Yëngëtu yu ñu seetlu (Observed movements):** This is too general and doesn't capture the internal, self-sustaining aspect of the rhythms discussed.
"
Ban baat mooy wone ay nit yuy wone ay nataalu copite ci seen yaram?,"The correct answer is **A: Monomorphe**.

The passage states: ""Su nit ñepp niroo ci ab dëkk lu ajju ci ab màndarga phenotipik dañu leen xam ci monomorfik."" This translates to: ""If all individuals in a population are similar in a phenotypic trait, they are known as monomorphic.""  Phenotypic traits are physical characteristics. Thus, monomorphic refers to individuals displaying uniform physical characteristics.
"
Ban ci yii toop mooy baat bu baax bi ngir organism mi toog ci ap bërëp mu wuute?,"The correct answer is **D: Polymorphe**.

Here's why:

*   **P: Ab askan ab ndajaleem këri espece yu xejjiku ci biir barab buñu joxe.** - This translates to: ""A population is a collection of species that live in a given area.""
*   **Su nit ñepp niroo ci ab dëkk lu ajju ci ab màndarga phenotipik dañu leen xam ci monomorfik.** - This means: ""If everyone in a population is identical in terms of a phenotypic trait, they are known as monomorphic.""
*   **Polymorphe mooy ñi nga xamni dañu bari lool mbir yu ñu bokk nuróo.** - This states: ""Polymorphic is those you know who have a lot in common that are similar.""

Given that the passage defines ""polymorphe"" as having different traits or appearances, it is the best fit to describe an organism that lives in a place where there is variety."
Ban ci yii toop moo dul doon ap misaalu bërëpu gàncax bu ñuy jëfëndikoo ngir jëfi turism?,"Jàmm! Ci lëkkalekaay bi, turism buy yëngu ci wàllum natiir dafay xëcc nit yi bëgg dem ci ay barab yu nantirel.

"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop mooy tërëlinu yoonu dem ak dikk bi?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Ay woto jambuur** (Private vehicles).

The passage describes how people commute in private vehicles (woto priwe) to work, causing significant carbon emissions that affect the biosphere. This directly relates to the topic of commuting.
"
Partikul yu xooxu orbit yan faanu sars la ñu am?,"The correct answer is **D: Sars yu baax ak yu baaxul**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the nucleus contains protons (which have a positive charge) and neutrons (which have no charge).
*   Therefore, the particles in the nucleus possess both positive and neutral charge. ""Sars yu baax"" translates to positive charge and ""Amuñu benn sars"" translates to ""no charge"" but together, the answer to the question is both positive and no charge."
Xoox bi yan partikul la am?,"The correct answer is **A: Ay feppsaal ak ay feppmaandu**

The text states: ""Xoox bi ñaari partikil la boole – nëtron ak poroton.""

*   ""Nëtron"" is translated to ""feppmaandu""
*   ""Proton"" is translated to ""feppsaal"""
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop mooy ap misaalu arafu seexal bu juroomi tomb?","The correct answer is **A: 1010**

Here's why:

* **Binary (Seexal):** The passage explicitly states that computers use binary code, which only consists of 0s and 1s.
* **Five Digits (Juroomi Tomb):** The question asks for a binary number with five digits.

Let's examine the options:

* **A: 1010** - Incorrect because it has only 4 digits
* **B: 12001** - Incorrect because it's not a binary number (it contains 2).
* **C: 10010** - Correct because it is a binary number with 5 digits
* **D: 110101** - Incorrect because it has 6 digits

Therefore, the answer is **C: 10010**
"
Lan ci mbir yii lañuy wooye chiffre binaire?,"The correct answer is **A: Ay tomb**.

The passage states: ""Li ñuy waawe nombre binaire mënul am ludul benn wala ñaari nimero, manaam 0 wala 1, te nombre yooyu lañuy woowe chiffre binaire - wala bit"". ""Tomb"" means digit, and in this context, a binary digit.
"
Ban ci yii toop la ñu limul ci lu ñu bind ni ap njariñ bu njëkk ngir ndongo yii di am bolog?,"The passage mentions the following benefits of blogging for students:

*   Improving grammar and spelling (A: Ap yeeslu ci tëgg waxin ak ci mën mënu mbind)
*   Expressing ideas more effectively
*   Connecting with the world and engaging their audience
*   Thinking critically and expanding their learning beyond usual study hours
*   Developing their own perspectives and responding to others' writing

Option B (Nàttango yi wàññi ngaññ yi - Reduced Costs) is not mentioned in the passage.
Option C (Ap xel mu ubbeeku ci lu leen wër - A more open mind about the world) relates to the idea of connecting with the world and expressing ideas more effectively, so it is mentioned.
Option D (Ap cofeel wu yokku ngir di wéy di jàng - Increased desire to keep learning) directly relates to the fact that ""Blogging ab jumtukaay la buy xalaatloo ab lëkkaloo te ñaax ndongo yi ñu yokk seeni njang ba romb bis yuñu daan faral di jàng""

Therefore, the answer is **B**.
"
Ban ci yii faanu bolog la ñu lim ni luy junj ndongo yi ñu yeesal seeniy mënin ci mbind?,"Based on the passage, the best answer is **A: Di tuntu saa su nekk ci jumtukaay yu nekk ci internet bi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions ""ndongo yi meenaño wax séni xalaat ci mbinduk ñénéén rawatina ci sééni xalaatu bopp (Oravec, 2002),"" which directly relates to engaging with online tools and content by other people (including themselves).
*   The passage highlights the way that blogging ""encourages students to expand their learning beyond their usual reading habits,"" so option A is relevant to the overall purpose of blogging.
*   Options B, C, and D aren't explicitly mentioned as reasons why blogging improves writing skills in the provided text.

**Translation for context:**
*   P: Blogs can help students to write. Students sometimes struggle with grammar and messy writing, and the presence of an audience changes that a lot. Since older students are better at expressing their ideas, bloggers focus more on how they write. Blogs ""motivate students to awaken their community to the world."" The desire to please their readers or followers makes them more focused (Toto, 2004). Blogging is a communication tool that encourages students to expand their learning beyond their usual reading habits. The use of this can empower students to develop their perspectives and ideas; by responding well to Internet technology, students can express their thoughts in the writing of others, especially in their own ideas (Oravec, 2002).""
*   Q: Which of the following blog features is listed as a way to encourage students to improve their writing skills?
*   A: Responding regularly to tools available on the internet
*   B: Wanting to avoid criticism
*   C: Holding the interest of their groups
*   D: The need to collaborate with others"
Ban ci yii toop moo nekkul ap njariñu jookalante asynchrone ngir ndongo yi? ,"The passage describes asynchronous communication as allowing students to think and reflect before responding, work at their own pace, and control the flow of information. It also mentions that using the internet and the web gives students access to information at any time, and they can send questions to instructors for a timely response.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Di jëfëndikoo internet ni ap jumtukaay (Using the internet as a tool):** The passage explicitly mentions that the internet and WWW enable asynchronous learning. So, this is a benefit.
*   **B: Mëna jakaarloo ak jàngalekat yi waxtu bu mu mëna doon ci bës bi (Being able to interact with instructors at any time of the day):** The passage states students can send questions to instructors during the day and receive timely responses. This is a clear advantage.
*   **C: Ay waxtu liggéey yu mëna wuute (Flexible working hours):** The passage states asynchronous communication allows the students to work at their desired pace. Thus, this is a benefit.
*   **D: Nekk njiit miy teete ñeneen ñi (Being a leader guiding others):** The passage focuses on the individual benefits of asynchronous communication (e.g., working at one's own pace, reflecting before responding). It doesn't mention leadership skills or leading others.

Therefore, the option that is NOT a benefit of asynchronous communication for students based on the provided text is **D: Nekk njiit miy teete ñeneen ñi (Being a leader guiding others)**.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci faanu jokalante asynchrone yii toop moo jagul ak ndongo yi?","The correct answer is **D: Jëfëndikoo internet**

Here's why:

* **P clearly states:** ""Jëfandikoo lënd gi ak World Wide Web may na ndongo yi ñu jot ci xibaar yi waxtu wu nekk."" (Using the internet and the World Wide Web allows students to access information at any time.) This directly connects internet use to asynchronous communication benefits for students, as they can access information and submit questions outside of scheduled class times.
* **The other options are less direct:**
    * **A: Jàng di jiite (Learning guides/leadership):** While learning guides might be used in conjunction with asynchronous communication, the passage doesn't directly link them.
    * **B: Ay waxtu liggéey (Working hours):**  Asynchronous communication flexibility helps with managing work hours, but it's not the primary focus related to *students* specifically.
    * **C: Jumtukaay yuy jàngale (Learning tools):** Internet provides access to a wide range of learning tools, but the core benefit is access to information anytime which is tied directly to the internet.

Therefore, **D** is the most direct and accurate answer based on the provided passage.
"
Lu ñu waxul ci baat bi ni lenn lu kenn mënuta boole ak këru buur ci jàmono xaaju àt ya?,"The question asks what aspect of castles is not explicitly mentioned in the description about how castles used to inspire ideas through imagery of jousts, banquets, and Arthurian romances.

The passage talks about:

*   Jousts (related to Chevalerie and Chevaliers)
*   Banquets (implicitly related to court life)
*   Romances (related to Chevalerie and Chevaliers)
*   Imagining the sounds and intensity of battles (Xeex di jëfëndikoo ay bant yu gudd, Xeex)

Ay paxu kaso (castle dungeons) are not directly mentioned in the prompt, which focuses on the romanticized image of castles rather than their grim function.

So the answer is **A: Ay paxu kaso**
"
Ban ci yii toop moom la ñu waxul ci lu ñu bind ni ap xet walla baat bu ñu mënutawoona wax ci biir këru buur yii daanu?,"Correct answer is **D: Ay tanku mala**.

Here's why:

*   **P** talks about battles (""xéx""), feasts (""banket""), and Arthurian balls (""sëwalëri yu Arthur"").
*   **P** talks about to think about long wars
*   **P** also talks about fear coming from these buildings. (""xégncu tiitangé gi bayyéko ci gnii."")
*   This doesn't leave talk about ""ay tanku mala"" (""dragon feet"")

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Ay tanku mala**."
Ban ci yii toop mooy ap firndeel bu dëggu bu kërup Kirby Muxloe?,"The correct answer is **C: Tabaxu këru buur bi mingoogul woon ak diir gi** (The construction of the castle was inconsistent with the period).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Kirby Muxloe is more like a fortified manor house than a true castle because it lacks typical defensive features (strong walls, small windows) expected of a castle.
*   It also mentions that the peace of the time meant people needed protection against murderers, but not necessarily a fully fortified castle.
*   This implies that the *style* of construction (more manor house than castle) didn't match the *need* for robust defenses that was typically associated with castle building in less peaceful times.
*   Therefore, the design/construction was inappropriate for the period and what it actually required, which relates to being inconsistent with its design during its time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ay miiru këru buur dëggëroon nañu lool te Boroom Hastings moo leen santaane woon** (The castle walls were very strong and Lord Hastings ordered them): This is directly contradicted by the passage, which says the opposite -- the walls were NOT strong.
*   **B: Soxlawoon na ñu dëggërëlaat ko tuuti ndax xeetu jàmm bu nekk ci réew mi ci waxtu tabax bi** (It was necessary to fortify it a little due to the peace in the country at the time of construction): This is also not supported. The passage suggests it was *not* very fortified *because* of the relatively peaceful time.
*   **D: Dañu ko tabaxoon ngir mu yagg lool te waajal xeex yi** (It was built to last a long time and prepare for war): The passage implies the opposite -- it wasn't really built for major warfare.

So, **C** is the only answer choice that accurately reflects the passage's argument."
Ban ci faanu tëralin yii la ñu mëna jàppee ni yu dul tontu faan yu ñu tàmm yi ngir Kërup Kirby Muxloe ci waxtu bu ñu bind ci mbind mi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ap tabax bu ñu tabax ngir tëkku xeex yi**.

Here's why:

*   **P states**: Satowu Kirby Muxloe gëna nekk kër gu nu miiree mu tëju ne ab sato dëgg. Sudee congu mu mag congu la, fenêtre vitrée yu mag yi ak mur yi waru ñu mëna des noonu te toju ñu. CI jamono 1480, bi Lord Hasting don tambali tabaxam, dëkk bi dafa xawon am jàmm te dañoo soxlawon kaarànge ngir muccu si raykatu nit yi.

This implies that it was not really built for serious military defense.
*   **A: Ay palanteer yu rëy**: The passage does describe large windows, suggesting that grand rooms existed.
*   **B: Ap tabax bu ñu tabax ngir tëkku xeex yi**: The passage does not state that the building was built to serve a purpose of a defensive building.
*   **C: Dëggërlukaay bu gëna néew yu yeen këru buur yi am**: The passage doesn't directly compare the level of fortification to other castles.
*   **D: Ay miir yu sew**: The passage does describe the thick walls of the building.

Therefore, only the fact that the building was not built to serve as a defensive structure does not respond to the primary claims of the passage."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop mooy doon biy gëna am njariñ ngir ap dawkat miy waajal waxtu mii di dikk si?","The passage focuses on:

*   **Building endurance (ndëgëraay):** Emphasized as crucial and must be trained.
*   **Running in cold weather:** Recommended training during the cold season.
*   **Upper body strength training:** Combining this with running for all-year preparation.

Based on this, the best advice for a runner preparing for the upcoming season is:

*   **D: Di jëfëndikoo bërëpu taagatu yaram gi ngir tabax jëm yaram bi feetee kaw (Using the gym to build upper body strength).**

This aligns with the passage's recommendation of combining running with upper body strength training for optimal preparation.

Therefore, the answer is **D**."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop moo am solo lool ngir ap dawkat buy daw xaaju kilomeetar te bokk ci ñu gën?","Based on the passage, the most important thing for a long-distance runner aiming for excellence is **B: Di jàng enduraans ci kaw dawin bu gaaw (Di jàng enduraans ci kaw dawin bu gaaw - Learning endurance over speed)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""yaggaay bi dafay mujj doon lu mënul ñakk"" which means ""endurance becomes indispensable"".
*   It also says ""gaway, wayé ndëgëraay dañ ko wara taggat ci lepp"" which means ""speed is important, but endurance should be trained above all else"".
"
"Ngir ap dawkat, ban ci yii toop la ñu mënuta antul ci ay taagatu lekk kesse?","The correct answer is **A: Yokk seen mënin**.

Here's why:

* **P says:** Purely food-based training cannot alone make you win in the home of champions, but it can affect the health of young athletes. Intense strength, correct movements, and knowing how to eat a well-balanced diet can help those who exercise increase their effort and increase their enjoyment of exercise.
* **Q asks:** For an athlete, which of the following cannot be attributed to training by diet alone?
* **A: Yokk seen mënin** - ""Yokk seen mënin"" translates to ""Increase their skills/ability.""  While diet contributes to performance, it's not the *only* factor in developing skills. Skill improvement comes from practice, coaching, and other types of training in addition to proper nutrition.
* **B: Yokk seen bànneex** - ""Yokk seen bànneex"" translates to ""Increase their enjoyment."" The passage states that eating right, along with other things, can ""yokk sén mbékté ci taggat yaram"" (increase their enjoyment of exercise).
* **C: Mënin gu gën** - ""Mënin gu gën"" translates to ""Better skills/ability."" This can be achieved, but the passage says that it takes other training to reach the goal.
* **D: Wër ci jëm yaram ji yëpp** - ""Wër ci jëm yaram ji yëpp"" translates to ""Health in the body.""  The passage mentions how bad diets can have affect the health, meaning that a good diet can lead to better health.

**In summary:** While diet is crucial for athletic performance and enjoyment, it's not sufficient *alone* to significantly improve skills or ability.
"
"Sukkëndiku ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop la ñu tektalul ni ap yoon ngir dawkat yu ndaw yi gëna am bànneex ci seen taagatu?","The passage focuses on the importance of a balanced diet, proper exercise, and diverse nutrition for young athletes to improve performance and enjoyment of their training. It doesn't mention drinking enough water.

Therefore, the answer is **C: Di naan ndox nu mu waree**.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lu tax ap dawkatu diggënte bu gaat wara jënd ap piesu jumtukaay bu gëna seer?","Based on the provided text, the best answer is **D: Am na ay xalaat yu dëgguwul jëm ci jumtukaay yu seerul lool yi (There are false ideas about inexpensive equipment)**.

Here's why:

*   **The premise (P) states:** ""...am ay njuumte ci wàllu xalaat yu bare jëmële ci tuuti jumtukaay yi mu laaj ngir bokk ci. Kenn yaa xam lu tax nga jënd produit waaye barina ci yoo xamni duñu mat liñu leen di doyee. ( ... there are many misconceptions about the small equipment required to participate. It is not known why one buys products, but there are many that do not meet what is required of them)""

*   **The question (Q) asks:** ""Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lu tax ap dawkatu diggënte bu gaat wara jënd ap piesu jumtukaay bu gëna seer? (According to what is written, why should a short distance runner buy a more expensive piece of equipment?)""

The answer must be because they have false ideas about inexpensive equipment.

*   **A: Nekk na lu ñu bëggël seen bopp (It's what they want):** While this *could* be true, the passage emphasizes *misconceptions*, not desires.
*   **B: Wone na ap njariñ (It shows a benefit):** The passage specifically states that ""barina ci yoo xamni duñu mat liñu leen di doyee (there are many that do not meet what is required of them)"", implying that expensive equipment may not always provide a real benefit for beginners.
*   **C: Dina sopi bu baax seen mënin (It will greatly change their ability):** As mentioned above, the passage says that more expensive equipment will not always provide a real benefit for beginners.
*   **D: Am na ay xalaat yu dëgguwul jëm ci jumtukaay yu seerul lool yi (There are false ideas about inexpensive equipment):** This directly addresses the misconception aspect highlighted in the premise.

Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan la daw diggënte bu gaat di laaj?","The correct answer is **C: Jumtukaay yu ndaw** (Small equipment).

The passage states that there are many misconceptions regarding the *small* amount of equipment needed for short-distance running. This directly corresponds to option C. The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Jumtukaay yu bare (A lot of equipment)**: The passage refutes this idea, stating that the equipment needs are *small*.
*   **B: Ap njiitlaayu dawkat bu sampu (An established running leadership)**: This is not discussed in the passage.
*   **D: Xaalis bu bare (A lot of money)**: While the passage mentions that people might overspend on running products, it emphasizes the misconception about the *amount of equipment*, not necessarily the cost.
"
Kan moo gëstu ba gis riiru nukléer yuy xëccaate? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch ak Purcell**.

The passage states that Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University).
"
Ci ban àt lañu nanguwoon royukaay bu njëkk mi ngir riiru paj ak nataal? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

The passage states that Raymond Damadian obtained the first patent in the field of MRI ""four years later"" after observing differences in MRI signals from cancerous tissue in 1970. 1970 + 4 years = 1974.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan la nit ñi wara am jëm ci am degg degg bu am doole ngir mëna firi jëfinu ñeneen ñi?","The correct answer is **B: Jublukaay** (Intent).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of understanding the *reason* behind someone's actions to correctly interpret them.  ""Jublukaay"" translates to ""Intent"" or ""Purpose"". To properly understand why someone is trying to open a car door, you need to understand their intent (are they stealing it, or are they trying to retrieve their own car?).

The other options are less directly related to the core concept:

*   **A: Bëgg bëgg (Desires):** While desires play a role in intention, the passage focuses on the overall *purpose* of the action.
*   **C: Ngëm (Beliefs):** Beliefs can influence actions, but the immediate key to understanding the action is knowing the person's *goal*.
*   **D: Gis gis (Vision/Perspective):** This could be relevant in some situations, but again, understanding the *reason* for the action is more directly linked."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, xam jublukaay dina dimbamli nit ñi ñu def lan?","The correct answer is **A: Daggal ñàkk xam ci ganaaw ay jëfin** (Reduce misunderstanding behind actions).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes understanding the intentions behind actions.** The example given is about someone trying to break into a car. Understanding their *intention* (to steal vs. trying to retrieve their own keys) changes how you interpret and react to the action.
* **Option A directly relates to this core idea.** ""Daggal ñàkk xam ci ganaaw ay jëfin"" means reducing the lack of understanding about the reasons behind actions.  Knowing the intent helps avoid misinterpreting the behavior.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Wax bëgg bëgg yi balaa ñuy am (Speak the desires before they exist):** This has nothing to do with the passage's focus on understanding existing actions.
    * **C: Xool ñéneen nit ñi te bañ leen a àtte (Look at other people and refuse to judge them):** While related to empathy, the core message is about understanding *why* people do things, not just avoiding judgment.
    * **D: Jàng xalaatu ñeneen ñi (Read the thoughts of other people):** While the passage mentions understanding thoughts, it is in the context of inferring them to understanding actions. Therefore understanding the actions is the most important.

Therefore, **A** is the best answer because it directly addresses the central theme of the passage: understanding the intentions behind actions to avoid misunderstanding.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop moo di ap tënk bu woor bu jublukaayu AI?","The correct answer is **D: Luy tambalil boppam liggéey**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage describes AI as a field that focuses on creating machines that can learn, adapt, and perform tasks requiring intelligence.** This directly aligns with the idea of a machine being able to start working on its own.
*   **A: Tërël palang** translates to ""Paint colors,"" this is not related to the central topic.
*   **B: Luy xaamee baat** translates to ""Analyzing words,"" this is not the focus of the text, as the passage mainly talks about IA.
*   **C: Tërëlin** translates to ""Writing,"" this is not related to the central topic."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop mooy lu ñuy tàmm booleel ak AI?","The correct answer is **D: Ràññee mbindu loxo (Recognizing handwriting)**.

Here's why:

* The paragraph specifically mentions ""di bind ci loxo nangu, baat ak kanam"" (recognizing handwriting, speech, and faces) as areas within AI research. The other options, while potentially benefiting from AI in some contexts, are not directly mentioned as core areas being tackled by AI research in this passage.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop mooy dooleeb kenn ak ay xalaat yuy bokk melokaan?","Based on the provided text, the best answer is **A: Di ràññee ay tontu yu bare yu nuroo jëm ci ap jafe jafe**.

Here's why:

*   The text emphasizes that this type of thinking leads to **multiple good solutions** (""mën nañu ci am tontu yu baax yu bari"").
*   It contrasts this with simpler thinking, where you're limited to just good/bad options.
*   The ability to identify many potential answers is a core strength of this divergent and creative thought process.

Let's look at why the other options are less fitting:

*   **B: Jëfëndikoo ay jumtukaay yu bées jëmële ko ci ap jafe jafe (Using new tools to solve a problem):** While technology is mentioned, the focus isn't primarily on *using* new tools, but on the *thought process* itself.
*   **C: Jël seen waxtu ngir saafara ay jafe jafe (Taking your time to solve problems):** The text mentions speed (""gaawaayam bi"") as an important factor, contradicting this option.
*   **D: Di rënk ci bopp bi ay melokaan (Memorizing patterns):** Memorization isn't central to the description of this kind of thinking. The focus is on generating multiple possible solutions, not recalling pre-existing patterns."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop la ñu jappeewul ap mbir mu ñuy fonk ci xalaat yu bokk mingoo?","The correct answer is **A: Xam ni benn tontu bu baax rek moo am**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that this type of thinking values finding *multiple* good solutions (""mën nañu ci am tontu yu baax yu bari""). Thinking that there's only one correct answer goes directly against the core principle of this divergent and solution-oriented approach. The passage highlights the focus on speed, receptiveness, appropriateness, and ability to identify facts, re-apply techniques, and gather data. The other options - taking your time, identifying truths, and collecting information - are all explicitly supported by the text. Therefore, only the idea that there is just one correct answer is not valued.

*   Options A, B and D align with the general ideas presented in the passage, even if the specific claim is not yet realized. Option C, however, goes further by stating that facial expressions *are* interpreted already. The passage does not claim that this is currently true."
Ban ci yii toop moo dem ba gëna am solo ndax Renaissance bi? ,"The correct answer is **B: Di wasaare xam-xam gi (Disseminating knowledge)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the shift in how knowledge is accessed and spread.** It mentions a change in the way knowledge is measured, information is acquired, and the difficulty now lies in verifying information rather than simply contacting someone.
* **The Renaissance brought a significant change in how knowledge is learned and *disseminated***.  This directly points to B being the most relevant aspect.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Woowaat sa bopp (Calling Yourself)** This is the most irrelevant answer. The text doesn't talk about people changing their identities.
* **C: Fattëli lu ñu bind (Remembering What Was Written)** While important, the focus is on *how* knowledge is spread and validated, not just on remembering.
* **D: Jot ay xebaar (Getting News)** Getting news is part of the information access process, but the passage focuses on a broader transformation of knowledge dissemination, not just news.

Therefore, the option that is **least** related to the desire to maintain a relationship is:

Travelling (di wëra tukki) is more directly associated with ""sa paspas"". The other options (connecting to work, family, and meeting new people) all align with maintaining or establishing relationships."

The passage states: ""Ci bi Moyen Âge di waaja jeex, ci la Europe sowu jant tàmbali dis fent dundiinu boppam."" (As the Middle Ages were coming to an end, Western Europe began to develop its own unique style.)

This translates to: ""As the Middle Ages were coming to an end, Western Europe began to discover its own identity. One of the most prominent economic developments of the time after the crusades was the introduction of buttons on clothing.""

Therefore, the use of buttons on clothing originated during the Middle Ages.

* **P states**: ""...Mbir yu joge ci jëya kese, te wuuteek ndofeel ak ragal lañu dan topp ayubés yu nek ak waaru liggéey PA. Yooyu nekk di bokk ci jëf yu bari yi soxla dimbal lu bari ci wàllum gis-gisu mettitu ràññee wuutale yi metiti bu koronik ak ñakka nekk ci yëngu-yëngu yaram bu jaar yoon."" This translates to ""...Things that come from habit alone, deviating from empathy and fear, lead to daily problems and PA's job difficulty. These are among the many actions that require a lot of help in terms of understanding pain, distinguishing between chronic pain and lack of proper physical activity.""
* **Q asks**: ""...ay aktviwite saa su nekk ñoo gënoona soxla ndimbël ngir lan?"" which translates to ""...activities need help for what reason?""
* **The connection**: P states that ""gis-gisu metit"" is the aspect that people need help with, and that translates to ""understanding pain"". So, option A is the correct answer.

The other options aren't the *primary* reason activities need help:

*   **B: Ndig li (The order/command)** - While instructions or commands can be confusing, the text focuses more on the *understanding of pain* itself.
*   **C: Xel mu yëngëtu (Active mind)** - A restless or active mind isn't explicitly mentioned as the *main* thing requiring help.
*   **D: Ragal (Fear)** - Fear is mentioned as something that's *deviated from*, not as the *reason* help is needed."

The passage clearly states ""Sport bi defnaniouko bu njeuk comba niar nitt, ken di beuré ak kenen ki"" which translates to ""The sport is originally done as a combat of two people, one wrestling with the other."" This directly indicates a two-person format. Therefore, the best answer is the one that reflects this two-person nature.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ngir xool ki ci lóru da nga wara njëkka saytu barab bi ngir àar sa kaarànge."" This translates to: ""To examine someone in distress, you must first inspect the area to protect your own safety."" Therefore, inspecting the area is the first action.
"
Ban ci baat yii nekkul di wone bu baax nuñuy gëstuwee ap viktim?,"The passage focuses on prioritizing your own safety and assessing the scene before helping a victim. Let's analyze the options:

*   **P:** Ngir xool ki ci lóru da nga wara njëkka saytu barab bi ngir àar sa kaarànge. Nda ngeena wara gëstu melokaanu ñi ci loru so koy jege ak bépp darapo bu xonk. Soo gaañoo ci jeema dimbali, kon defoo ludul yokk jafe-jafe bi.

*   **Translation of P:** When approaching a victim, you must first assess the scene for your own safety. You should also analyze the victim's condition as you approach and any red flags. If you get injured trying to help, you will only exacerbate the problem.

Let's analyze the options for Q:
*   **A:** Bul topatoo lii di teye say metitu bopp (Ignore your personal suffering) - This doesn't directly relate to assessing the victim.
*   **B:** Demal ca bërëp ba balaa viktim bi (Go to the scene before the victim) - This doesn't make sense in the context. You wouldn't arrive before the victim.
*   **C:** Gëstul taxawaayu viktim bi (Analyze the victim's condition) - This aligns with the passage's emphasis on assessing the victim's condition.
*   **D:** Jeemala ràññee bepp tektal bu fës (Try to identify every visible clue) - This also aligns with assessing the scene and the victim.

The answer that doesn't fit is **A: Bul topatoo lii di teye say metitu bopp** because ignoring your personal suffering is not something that the text recommends for helping a victim, and the other options are good advice for assessing the scene or a victim.

**Therefore, the correct answer is A.**"

*   The passage specifically mentions that the French Revolution moved from a system where military leadership was based on class (""oliyee kë ñuy toftale larmé bi ci ay kalaas"") to one based on merit (""léegi ci ay kaliibër lañu nekk""). This directly reflects the shift from class-based hierarchy to a meritocracy. While the other options are also influenced by the French Revolution, option B is the MOST direct effect on sitwayin yiy liggéey (working citizens)."
"Di toop Revolution Française bi, ndam ci xarekat yi ak yeneeni liggéey yi tegu wu ñu woon ci lan?","The correct answer is **A: Ndam**.

The question asks what the success of the French Revolution and its warfare/labor achievements were based on. The provided text mentions that the Revolution led to movements for greater rights and successes. ""Ndam"" translates to success/victory, making it the most appropriate answer.
"
Ban servis publik la ñu wax ni mooy indi ñakk mbégte bu rëy ci réew yuy meññ?,"The correct answer is **C: Wallub dem ak dikk bi** (The transport sector).

The passage clearly states that transport (dem ak dikk) causes frequent complaints and problems, especially in developing countries.  The question asks which public service is most likely to cause great dissatisfaction in developing countries.  The passage directly connects transport with dissatisfaction.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan la ñu mëna wax jëm ci doxalinu dem ak dikk bi?","The correct answer is **C: Dañuy indi ay ñaxtu yu bare yuy joge ci ñu leen di jëfëndikoo (They cause many complaints from those who use them).**

The passage explicitly states that ""Daanaka ku nekk dafay njaxtu ci kureelu dem ak dikk gi"" (Almost everyone complains about public transportation). This directly supports option C.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop ñoo mëna metee natt ndax dowalkat yu ñu mënuta nand?","The correct answer is **D: Nu dowal bi mel**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the driver's behavior is difficult to observe and quantify precisely (""doxalinu dawalkat bi kenn mënu ko gisaane gisaane gu wóor""). ""Nu dowal bi mel"" (the way someone drives) directly reflects the driver's behavior. While speed, density, and flow can be measured, the *manner* of driving is subjective and hard to quantify directly due to the unobservable aspects of the driver's decision-making.
"
Ban ci yii toop mooy bu ñuy jëfëndikoo ngir teewal dem ak dikk bi ci ay araf?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: Nu dem ak dikk bi baree**.

Here's why:

The passage states that to represent traffic flow effectively, they establish a relationship between three distinct characteristics:

*   **Jaabante** (which translates to ""Density"" or ""Concentration"")
*   **Taraay** (which translates to ""Flow"" or ""Volume"")
*   **Gaawaay** (which translates to ""Speed"")

""Nu dem ak dikk bi baree"" refers to taraay which is flow or volume. Flow (taraay) describes the rate at which vehicles pass a point, and a high flow means there is a lot of coming and going.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Lu jumtukaay génétik amee solo:** While the importance of the genetic material is crucial in biology in general, it does not directly answer the question of the requirements for a mutation to be passed on to offspring, as the passage dictates that only germinal cell mutations can be passed down.
*   **C: Faanu copite bi:** This is irrelevant.
*   **D: Ndax copite bi mën na tax selul yi dee:** While a mutation might cause cell death, this doesn't explain the conditions necessary for it to be inherited. The statement specifically highlights that only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring."

Jublukaayu golf mooy di jël njëg bu gëna ndawu lan?,"The answer is **D: Ay pax**

The passage describes golf as a sport where players use clubs to hit balls into holes (""pax""). The goal is to complete the course with the fewest strokes.
"
"Ci njàngale wu golf, fan la ñu dogee ñax wi mu gëna gàtt?","The correct answer is **B: Ci wert bi (Ci wert bi)**.

The text states: ""Po mi ci ñax bi la amé, ak ñax bi ci wétu kamb gi ñu dagg ko tuuti té diko woowé wéert bi."" This translates to ""The hole is on the grass, and the grass around the hole is cut short and called the green."" Therefore, the grass is cut shorter in the green (wert bi).
"
Ban mooy jublukaayu ap gëstu?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngir xam nu àdduna bi di doxee** (To understand how the world works).

Here's why:

* **P explicitly states:** ""Li gëna taxa jog science mooy xam ni àdduna bi di doxee ci anam wu mengoo ak xarala."" (The main purpose of science is to understand how the world works in a structured and logical way.)
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan moo dul dimbëli teete ap gëstu sientifik?","Based on the passage provided:

*   **P** describes the essence of science as understanding how the world works methodically. It emphasizes that scientific research is rooted in this methodical understanding. Scientific research is more than just experiments; it also encompasses observations, questioning, and reliance on existing knowledge.

*   **Q** asks what hinders scientific research, given the written text.

Given the description in P:

*   Doing scientific steps alone won't assist research. **(A: Doxalin sientifik bi kesse):**
*   Making observations is fundamental to research.( **B: Di def ay seetlu) is essential and doesn't hinder.**
*   Dropping possible hypothesis is important in research **(C: Dindi ay hyphothèse yu mëna am)**
*   Making research won't affect a scientific research, it's necessary for development(**D: Teete ay gëstu)**.

So the right answer is **A: Doxalin sientifik bi kesse**"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban baat jëm ci tornade moo dëgguwul?","The correct answer is **C: Lu ëp ci tornade yi dañuy dem ba ropi ñeeti waxtu (Most tornadoes last for over three hours).**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Ñaar ci téemeru tornaat yu gëna metti lu ëpp ñetti waxtu lañu def."" This translates to ""Two percent of the most severe tornadoes last for over three hours."" This indicates that *most* tornadoes do *not* last that long.

The other options are supported by the text:

*   A: ""Ngélaw yi meena yaxx ci beereeb bu tuuti bugnu ko mingeelék yu am doolé yi, waye meennagnoo yaxx lép lu nékk ci sén yoon"" translates to ""Tornadoes can cause damage in a small area compared to other storms, but can destroy everything in their path.""
*   B: ""Ngélaw yi meena yaxx ci beereeb bu tuuti bugnu ko mingeelék yu am doolé yi"" translates to ""Tornadoes can cause damage in a small area compared to other storms"".
*   D: ""Ngélawu yu am doolé yii dawnagnu ci 480km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph)"" translates to ""Strong winds can reach 480km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph)."" The speeds are provided in miles per hour instead of meters, but this does not change the fact that it can be supported by the text."
"Di sukkëndiiku ci lu ñu wax, ban ci baat yii toop mooy wone bu baax lu ëp ci tornade yi?","The best answer is **D: Mën nañoo budee ay garab ci suuf si**.

Here's why:

*   **P states:** Tampet yi dañoo daanel garab yi... (Tornadoes can uproot trees...)
*   This is direct evidence from the passage

**Why the other options are not the *best* answer:**

*   **A: Dañuy tàmm di yagg ba romb ñeeti waxtu (They usually last more than three hours)** While the passage mentions that 2% of the *most severe* tornadoes last more than three hours, this isn't a general characteristic of all tornadoes.
*   **B: Dañuy sàkk ngelaw guy ëf ba 480 meetar ci waxtu (They generate winds up to 480 meters per hour)** The passage states 480 kilometers per hour, not meters per hour.
*   **C: Dañuy laal ay bërëp yu gëna rëy wuuteeg yeneeni taw yu metee meti yi (They affect a larger area than other severe storms)** While tornadoes can cause extensive damage, the passage doesn't explicitly compare the size of the area they affect to other types of storms.
"
Ban ci yii toop la nit ñi tambalee def ci xarnub 16 bi?,"The correct answer is **D: Di defar ay teleskop**.

The passage states that telescopes were first made in Europe in the late 16th century.
"
Ci ñaata diir la nit ñi di rëyël ay jumtukaay ci di jëfëndikoo ay lentiy?,"The correct answer is **C: Ci diiru ay junni àt** (In the course of thousands of years).

The passage states that humans used lenses for adornment for thousands of years, but telescopes were only invented at the end of the 16th century. Therefore, humans were using lenses for magnification (making things bigger) for thousands of years (through adornment), before telescopes that were specifically used to magnify distant objects were invented.
"
"Di sukkëndiku ci lu ñu bind, lan la paxu Muhomet di wax ci ay jëfi diineem walla ngëm?","The most appropriate answer based on the provided text is **B: Sori coow mën na dimbali gëstu (Being away from noise helps research).**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states Muhammad went to the cave of Hira to ""xalaat"" (think/meditate/reflect). The passage also suggests the cave is distant from the world.
*   The other options are not supported by the passage:
    *   **A: Dafa fonk jàmm ak togee boor (He values peace and reconciliation)**: While meditation may indirectly promote peace, the passage does not specifically mention it.
    *   **C: Dafa soxlawoon ay waxtu yu neew fu mu nekkee moom dong (He needed short moments where he was alone)**: It is never stated that Muhammad ""needed short moments"" of solitude.
    *   **D: Dafa jaaxlewoon ci ñu koy gis te di ko degg (He was worried about being seen and heard)**: Although being isolated is the goal, the text does not suggest any feelings of anxiety or worry."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan la ñu doon njëkk a jëfëndikoowee weñ?","D'après le texte, avant d'utiliser le fer pour les rails, on l'utilisait pour les **P: Yoonu saxar yu bari tabax nañu ko ci Angalteer ci téél ci 16eelu xarnu bi. Doonte yoonu saxaar yi ñaari band yu jàkkarloo la, danoo may nanu fas yi di leen xëcc ngir nu am gaawaay te yóbbu yab yu gëna bare cii yoon yixawa gën dëggr yu tey.

La phrase ""Waaye weñ wi waral na yaqu-yaqu yu bari ci pono wagon yu bant yi. Ci lu gaaw, dañoo wuutale ay pono bànt ak ay pono weñ."" indique que des pièces (pono) de wagons étaient initialement en bois et ont été remplacées par des pièces en fer.  Par conséquent, la bonne réponse est **C: Ay pënë**.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lu tax ñu wecci ay pënë bant ak ay pënë weñ?","The correct answer is **D: Dañu doon yakku ndax weñ wi ci raay yi.**

The passage explicitly states: ""weñ wi waral na yaqu-yaqu yu bari ci pono wagon yu bant yi. Ci lu gaaw, dañoo wuutale ay pono bànt ak ay pono weñ."" (The iron caused a lot of damage to the wooden wagon axles. Quickly, they replaced wooden axles with iron axles).
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan moo jubënti nit ñi diirub jàmono mbëggeel?","The correct answer is **D: Cosaan (Cosaan)**.

The passage states that Romanticism focused on traditions and origins that aligned with the place of origin.  Therefore, origins (cosaan) are what guided people during the Romantic period.
"
Ban ci baat yii toop ñoo dul wone ap xalaat bu yaatu jëm ci xalaat bii ñuy foogee ni copite teknik nekk na lu jogewul ci askan wi? ,"The correct answer is **B: Yaatuwaayu teknolosi nekkul lu cosaan di jiitël**

Here's why:

*   **P** states: ""Lu ëpp ci gisgisu ndawartél xarala day séddo ñaari xalaat: ni jëm kanamu xarala ci boppam day top bénn yoon bu nékk lool ci kaw xalaatu aada wala politik, té xarala ci boppam amna doxalin ci nékkinu nit yi, ci ludul weeru ci nekkinu nit yi.""
*   **B** goes along the idea of what is stated in **P** by going against the idea that technological advancement is dependent upon ""cosaan"" which refers to the cultural or historical origins of society."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop moo bokkul ak tàllal fiitukaay bi?","Let's break down the question and the passage:

*   **The passage (P) describes two bowing techniques for a string instrument (likely a violin or cello):**
    *   **""Up bow"":** The bow moves upwards, away from the player. It is described as resembling a ""V"".
    *   **""Down bow"":** The bow moves downwards, towards the player. It is described as resembling a straight line or something without curved sides.
    *   The passage specifies where on the bow to contact the string for each technique. Up bow uses the tip of the bow, Down bow uses the lower part of the bow(where your hand holds).
    *   The passage also mentions differences in sound and curve of the mark.

*   **The question (Q) asks which option is NOT related to bowing technique or the bow itself.**

Now let's examine the options:

*   **A: Ap baat bu neex (A pleasant sound):** Bowing technique directly impacts the sound produced, therefore, this relates to bowing.

*   **B: Ap mandarga buy mel ni ap takkalante (A mark that resembles a cross):** The passage mentions making marks with crayons, and that the curved marks were a result of the playing not printed. This would be related to the up-bow technique.

*   **C: Ap baat bu gëna dëggër (A louder sound):** It mentions that Down bows will produce louder sounds.

*   **D: Tambalee ci suuf ni ap mboot (Starting from the bottom like a boot):** The passage mentioned how the bow is contacted during a down bow.

Therefore, the option that is *least* related to bowing technique or the bow is **A: Ap baat bu neex (A pleasant sound)**. While a pleasant sound is *related* to playing, the question asks about the act of playing.

**Final Answer: A**"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop ñoo bokk ak baat bu neex?","The correct answer is **A: Ap fitukaay bu ñu jubël suuf.**

Here's why:

* **The text describes ""up bow"" resembling a V and ""down bow"" resembling a fitukaay bu amul wetu suuf (something without a point to the ground). ""Neex"" implies comfort or ease, and a fitukaay (a tool to fit) being pointed towards the ground makes an allusion to a downward movement which might be more difficult than lifting up a V shape.
* **The other options are incorrect because they do not relate to the meaning of the word ""neex"":**
    * **B:** Tàllal fitukaay bi (Extending the bow) is a basic instruction about use.
    * **C:** Ap mandarga buy mel ni V (A mark that looks like a V) is not related to something comfortable or easy to play.
    * **D:** Tambalee fu sa loxo teyee fiit wi (Start where your hand holds the bow) is about technique.
"
Fosil yi dañuy wone ni ay loxo yu ñu defar ngir ñu jëfëndikoo leen ngir yan ci yii?,"The correct answer is **B: Yenu lu diis**.

Here's why:

The text in paragraph P specifically states that the fossil shows specialization in the hand for *manipulating objects* and the hands of other primates are used for lifting heavy objects so ""Yenu lu diis (lifting heavy objects)"" is the best fit.
"
Ban ci yii toop ñooy wone bu baax falaanju golo? ,"The passage states: ""Tank ak loxo golo bénn laci tollu waay ak ci gudday, di wané jeefeendiko loxo ngir yénu lu diis té di dox."" This directly corresponds to option **B: Seeniy loxo ak seeniy tànk tooloo wu ñu ci jëm** and **C: Dañu leen di jëfëndikoo ngir yëkëti yen**.

Both B and C are correct, but **B** is the most accurate and fundamental difference emphasized in the passage. While C is a consequence of their limb structure. 
"
Tànn gi dafay dindi copite genetik yu bees yi tambalee ban wet?,"Correct answer: **A: Nëbu**

Explanation:

The text says ""tànneef bi dafay dindi mbir yu bari yuñ ci jota wax"". This implies that selection removes genetic variations that have already manifested. So the opposite of that would be the hidden/masked variations.

Therefore, the answer is **Nëbu** (Hidden).
"
Ban doxalin mooy topatoo di dooli ay copite genetik?,"The answer is **C: Copite** (Copy).

Here's why:

* **The text describes genetic diversity.** The passage mentions genetic variation and selection acting upon it. Copying of genetic material (replication) is a fundamental process that ensures genes are passed down, and errors during copying (mutations) are a source of new genetic diversity.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Segregasion (Segregation):** Segregation refers to the separation of alleles during meiosis, not the increase in copies of genes.
* **B: Boolewaat (Recombination):** Recombination shuffles existing genetic material, but does not directly *increase* the number of gene copies.
* **D: Wone (Expression):** Gene expression is the process by which the information encoded in a gene is used to synthesize a functional gene product (protein or RNA). While expression is critical, it does not relate to *increasing* the number of gene copies.

**Therefore, the best answer is C: Copite (Copy)** because it is the process of duplicating genetic information.
"
"Di sukkëndiku ci xebaar bi ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii la ap primat di lekk ngir saafara “jafe jafe ñàkk proteine”?","The correct answer is **C: Ay njeereer (Meat)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that primates in the forest struggle to get the necessary amino acids from plants alone due to their digestive systems.
* It then states, ""Sudee ñam yi bawoo ci lu am bakkan (melentaan, max, nen) dañu yomba reesal, rax ci dolli dañu bari protéine ak ay acide aminé yu am solo ci wérgi-yaram."" This translates to: ""Foods from animal sources (meat, fish, eggs) are easily digested, and they are rich in protein and essential amino acids.""

Therefore, to overcome the ""protein problem,"" primates (and our ancestors) would need to consume meat.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci jafe jafe yii toop la dul ñàkk amino asid di indi?","The correct answer is **D: Dee (Death)**.

The passage states: ""Itam, mënadi dëf li amna ay mujjantal yu diis: ñakk xel, xiibon, ak mujje dee."" This directly translates to: ""Also, doing that can have serious consequences: mental slowness, stunted growth, and ultimately death."" This clearly connects a lack of essential amino acids (implied by the difficulty of obtaining them from the forest resources) to death. The other options are mentioned as possible consequences, but death is the most extreme and direct one linked in the provided text.
"
Naka la ñu bokk ci ap cosaan di wonee saa su nekk seen bokk ci mbooloo mi?,"Based on the provided text, the best answer is **D: Ci di jëfëndikoo estil ni ap mandarga**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Ñi bokk ci aada bu ndaw dañ koy wone saa su né ci ay jëf yu wuuté, bokna ci jëfin, doxalin, ak waxin."" This directly implies that belonging to a subculture is shown through distinct actions, behaviors, and speech, which can all be seen as stylistic choices or ""estil"" used as a marker of belonging.
*   The other options are less directly supported by the text:

    *   **A: Ci di ko jeema jaxase:** While subcultures might distinguish themselves, the primary goal isn't necessarily to cause confusion. It's more about expressing identity.
    *   **B: Ci di nangu gëm gëmu kepp ku leen wër:** The text doesn't say that someone has to accept the beliefs of everyone around them to belong to a subculture.
    *   **C: Ci di nangu yoon yu ñu tërël ci mbooloo mi:** While there might be rules within a subculture, the provided text doesn't specifically address this. It is more about the expression of belonging."
"Jëm ci téori bu ñu wone ci lu ñu bind, lan moo mëna dal ap gone guy ràññële ku ak neewteeb xeet bu ñuy xolee ni ku am ay jëfin yuy fitnaal?","The most likely answer based on the provided passage is **B: Gone gi dina ci bu leer bokk ci ay doxalin yuy fitnalaate.**

Here's why:

*   **The passage indicates a tendency to conform to stereotypes:** The first statement highlights that children tend to accept stereotypes associated with their race or physical characteristics and then act in accordance with them. If a child is labelled as being disruptive, they might internalize it and act more disruptive.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Gone gi dina jeema moytu di bokk ci ay doxalin yuy fitnalaate.** (The child will try to avoid participating in disruptive behaviors): This goes against the tendency described in the original passage.
*   **C: Gone gi dina dem toog moom kesse ci waxtu ndaje mbooloo.** (The child will sit alone during group activities): While possible, it is not the most direct response to the stereotype of being disruptive.
*   **D: Gone gi dina baña booloo ak yeneeni xeet yu neew yi.** (The child will not associate with other minority groups): This is not necessarily related to the question."

"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop moo mingoowul ak màggaayu gone gu wex?","The correct answer is **B: Mën mënu waxtaan gu rëy (Inability to engage in complex conversation)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes feral children, who are raised with minimal or no human contact. Due to this lack of interaction and nurturing, they would have significant difficulties in language development and therefore, the ability to engage in complex conversation. Options A, C and D are attributes of someone who has not been socialized.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop mooy wone jëfinu ap gone gu rëb?","Based on the provided text (P), the most accurate answer is:

**B: Jëfin yu rëb mën a jibee ci ñàkk booloo ak nit ñi (Behavioral problems can arise from a lack of connection with people)**

Here's why:

*   The passage describes children growing up in isolation, neglect, and abuse. This lack of positive human interaction is directly linked to the development of unusual behaviors (mimicking animals, fear, lack of social skills).

Let's analyze why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Lu ëp ci jëfin yu rëb ap ñàkk ci yaram gee ko indi (Most behavioral problems are caused by a physical deficiency)**: The passage doesn't primarily focus on physical deficiencies as the cause, but rather on social deprivation.
*   **C: Jëfin yu rëb ci gone yu seeniy waajur doon tej la ëpee (Behavioral problems are most common in children who are locked up by their parents)**: While the passage mentions some children being locked up, it's not presented as the *primary* or most common cause of the behaviors. The broader theme is a lack of nurturing human contact.
*   **D: Jëfin yu rëb yi yëpp laago gu meti ci wallum bopp moo ko indi (All behavioral problems are caused by severe mental trauma)**: While trauma is likely a factor, the text implies that lack of socialization and interaction is a leading cause. The behaviors, such as mimicking animals, can be a direct result of their environment."

Ban ci yii toop mooy wone bu baax jëfëndikoowu mbay ngir mëna dund?,"The correct answer is **A: Nekk na lu jëm ci lekk mu jogee ci mbay (It is aimed at food from agriculture)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage P clearly states that subsistence farming (""lekk gu doy ci wàllu mbay"") is farming where the yield is enough for the farmer and their family to feed themselves (""ngir njureefam doy ngir baykat bi ak waa këram gis ci seen bopp"").** This directly connects to option A.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Dafay jëfëndikoo ay tekniku boppam ngir goob lu bare (It uses specific techniques to harvest a lot):** While some techniques might be used, the *primary* goal of subsistence farming isn't necessarily to maximize yield above all else, but to provide sufficient food for the family.
* **C: Dafay may baykat yi ñu seedo lu ñu goob ci biir dëkk bi yëpp (It allows farmers to distribute what they harvest throughout the whole town):** This is the opposite of subsistence farming, which focuses on the farmer and their family.
* **D: Yenn baykat yi ci yenn askan yi ñungi koy jëfëndikoo (Some farmers in some communities use it):** While true, this is too broad and doesn't define the *purpose* of subsistence farming. The key is *why* they use it: to feed themselves.

Therefore, **A** is the best and most direct answer.
"
Di seeti ap musée dina tegu ci ban faanu turism?,"The correct answer is **C: Turism cosaan** (Cultural tourism).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Li tax nit di sééti bénn beereeb mooy dafa bëggee xam taarix bi ak aada bi kon séétsi boobu mooy séétuk aada."" (The reason people visit a place is that they want to know its history and culture, therefore that visit is cultural tourism).
*   Visiting a museum is directly related to learning about history and culture.
*   Therefore, visiting a museum falls under the category of cultural tourism."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan moo mëna nekk lu gëna am solo ngir tukkikat yu koy def ngir peex mi walla yeneeni aktivite?","The correct answer is **B: Jël ap diir ngir nopali ku ci lu ñu tàmm di def (Take some time to relax and do what you enjoy).**

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Su ñuy xool tourisme bi gëna siiw mooy bi gëna méngoo ak li tax nit ñi di tukki: Tukki ngir bégal seen xol. Loolu mooy waxtu wi nit ñi di joge ci barab bi ñuy faral di nekk, dem ci beneen barab ngir noppalu."" This directly translates to people traveling to please their hearts and relax.
*   **The question asks:** ""Lan moo mëna nekk lu gëna am solo ngir tukkikat yu koy def ngir peex mi walla yeneeni aktivite?"" This asks what is the most important for tourists who travel for leisure or other activities.

Therefore, option B, which emphasizes relaxation and doing enjoyable activities, aligns perfectly with the passage's focus on tourism for personal enjoyment and relaxation. The other options are related to cultural or historical tourism, which is mentioned in the passage but not the primary reason for the type of tourism the question is focusing on."
Lu ñu maas ci wax ji ni lenn lu dimbali wàññi ragalu copite ci biir jàngu bi?,"The correct answer is **A: Fatëliku ay misaalu ndamu jëfi entreprenër (Remembering successful examples of entrepreneurial actions)**

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions that ""fàttaliku misaal yu yàgg yu doxaliinu entrepreneur te mujjee doon ay tax na ba nit ñi ubbeeku ci ay coppite yu bees ak jubluwaay bu bees ngir jàngu bi ci dëkk bi."" This translates to ""remembering old examples of entrepreneurial actions that were successful has caused people to be open to new changes and new goals for the school in the town.""  The passage then goes on to say that such examples ""dina tax nit ñu bari dootu ñu ragal lool coppite (will cause many people to no longer be so afraid of change).""

The other options are related to the passage, but they don't directly address the reduction of fear of change:

*   **B: Am gis gis ci nit ñi sopi cosaanu kureel gi (Having insight into the people who changed the culture of the group)** - While understanding the impact of change agents is valuable, it's not explicitly stated as reducing fear of change in the same way as successful examples.
*   **C: Gis doole yuy jiitël kureel gi (Seeing the forces that lead the group)** - This is about understanding the driving forces, not directly about overcoming fear.
*   **D: Xam taariixu kureel gi (Knowing the history of the group)** - While history is important, the specific act of *remembering successful examples* is what's highlighted as diminishing fear.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, am ap xamxamu taariixu kenn dina mën a dimbali ak lan?","The correct answer is **C: Yeg ni am nga palaas ci biir kureel gi**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Naam xam sa taarix tekkiwul nix am nga sa aada, waaye loolu mën na may ñenn ñi ñu mën a xam ñoom ñooy kan ci mbootaay gi ñu bokk."" This directly translates to: ""Although knowing your history doesn't mean you have culture, it *can* allow some to understand *who they are within the community they belong to*.""  Therefore, knowing one's history can help someone feel like they have a place within their group.
Let's look at why the other options aren't the best fit:

*   **A: Wàññi ragalu copite (Reduce fear of change)**: While the passage discusses how remembering past entrepreneurial successes can lead to openness to change, the core idea of understanding history is not primarily about reducing the fear of change.
*   **B: Dooleel njariñ yi (Strengthen benefits)**: The passage doesn't directly link understanding history to strengthening benefits.
*   **D: Yeesal jëfi entreprenër (Renew entrepreneurial actions)**: This is a related point mentioned in the example, but not the main benefit of historical understanding.

Ban ci baat yii ñooy wone nu ñuy jegee njàng mi ci jàmono bu jiitu diirub téy?,"The correct answer is **B: Njàng dafa wara jublu ci ay mbir yu ñu gëm ni dina ñu leen dundi** (Learning should focus on things that one believes they will experience).

Here's why:

* **The passage argues AGAINST a postmodern approach** where anything goes and there are no set values. It laments that people are passively consuming information (through TV) instead of actively engaging in learning and applying knowledge to real-world activities.
* **Option B** aligns with this lament.  It suggests that learning should be **practical and relevant** to one's life and potential experiences, contrasting the passive consumption criticized in the passage. The passage states that ""we will never repair a boat, build a dam in our backyard, travel to Peru to explore ancient ruins, or repair our neighbor’s house."" This implies that current learning lacks practical application and doesn't connect to tangible experiences, which option B directly addresses as a preferable alternative.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Yeen jaar jaar ci njàng ñoo gëna am njariñ yeneen yi** (Some educational experiences are more valuable than others). This contradicts the postmodern view described in the passage, which rejects any hierarchy of knowledge.
* **C: Yenn faanu jàng yu gën yeneen yi** (Some learning methods are better than others).  This also clashes with the postmodern viewpoint, which says there is no single correct way to learn.
* **D: Ci njàng amul ap dëgg bu nekk ba fàww** (There is no absolute truth in learning). This is a hallmark of the postmodern approach that the passage is criticizing.

Therefore, **B** best reflects a vision of education *before* the postmodern approach outlined in the passage – an education focused on relevant, practical experiences.
"
Ban ci baat yii toop moo dul wone ap jege njàng bu jiitu diirub téy?,"The correct answer is **D: Xam-xam bu ñu mëna mësa baña jëfee am na njariñ ngir ñu jàng ko ba tey** (Knowledge that we may never use is still valuable to learn).

Here's why:

*   The passage argues that postmodern education focuses on individual experience and rejects the idea of a fixed curriculum or essential knowledge. It criticizes traditional education for presenting knowledge that people don't directly apply in their lives.

*   Option D directly contradicts this postmodern view. It says that knowledge is valuable *even if* it's never used. This aligns with a more traditional view of education, where learning is considered valuable for its own sake, regardless of immediate practical application.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Am na ay yoon yu bare ngir jàng xebaar** (There are many ways to learn information). This fits well with the postmodern emphasis on individual learning paths and rejecting a single ""right"" way to learn.

*   **B: Yeen jaar jaar ci njàng dañu leen wara gënëleeg ak yeneen yi** (Different learning journeys should be promoted). This aligns with the postmodern idea that individual learning experiences are valid and should be encouraged.

*   **C: Ap jaar jaar ci njàng sukkëndiku na ci kuy jàng ak xam-xam gi ñu wone** (A learning journey depends on the learner and the knowledge presented). This reflects the postmodern view that learning is a personal and subjective experience, shaped by the individual and the specific context.

Therefore, only **Option D** represents a pre-modern perspective that contradicts the postmodern view presented in the passage.

"Ba ngeen yeewoo ci ni ngeen ko bëggee ci waxtu nelaw, ban ci yii mooy mëna xew ndax nelaw gu ngeen dagg?","The correct answer is **C: Fay alarm bi ci sa wet te deluwaat nelaw ñaar fukki simili yi ci toop**.

Here's why:

* **P** describes ""dagg nelaw mooy doxalin boo xam ne yaay dagg sa nelaw ci sa coobare daldi nelawaat ci lu yàggul (10-60 smilii)."" This translates to ""cutting sleep is a process where you interrupt your sleep for a short period (10-60 seconds) and then go back to sleep.""

* Option **C** directly reflects this description: you turn off the alarm (interrupting your sleep) and then immediately go back to sleep for 20 seconds.

The other options don't align with the core concept of briefly interrupting sleep and returning to it quickly:

* **A:** Jàng benn waxtu ak xaaj balaa ngay nelawaat (Read one and a half hours before going back to sleep) - Too long of an interruption.
* **B:** Jëfëndikoo wanag yi te gaaw deluwaat tëddi (Use the pillows and quickly go back to bed) - Doesn't involve interrupting sleep.
* **D:** Yeewu ngir naan ndox ci buteel mi nekk ci sa wet (Wake up to drink water from the bottle next to you) - While drinking water might be part of a sleep routine, it doesn't necessarily fit the brief interruption and return to sleep described in the passage.

Ban ci yii toop moo nekkul ap wone bu dëggu ci nelaw gu ñu dog?,"La réponse correcte est **D: Boo leen yeewoo, jublukaay bi mooy deluwaat nelaw ci diirub ñaari waxtu**.

Pourquoi ?

* **La définition de ""nelaw gu ñu dog"" (sieste fractionnée)** dans le texte original dit que le but est de se rendormir rapidement, entre 10 et 60 minutes, et non pas deux heures. Les autres options sont cohérentes avec la définition.

"Ni yuur bi di jeemee di indi geent saa su nekk, lan moo yokku?","The correct answer is **D: Waxtu bu nekk ci diggënte état wu REM yi** (Time spent between REM states).

The passage states: ""Li waral mbiir mii mooy njureefi gént di xoole yokk guddaayu waxtu bi ci digganté nekkinu REM yi."" This translates to: ""The reason for this is the brain looking to increase the length of time between REM states.""
"
Ban ci éfe yu baaxul yii toop la géent yu ñu ràññee mëna am ci jëmu yaram gi?,"The passage states: ""Li waral mbiir mii mooy njureefi gént di xoole yokk guddaayu waxtu bi ci digganté nekkinu REM yi. Ak REM yu néew ci guddi gi, jamono yi ngay yëg ni yaa ngi ci nelaw yu neex nga yëg ni sa yaram di noppaloo lu jafee am la, ngir nekk jafe-jafe.""

This translates to: ""The reason for this is the generation of dreams focuses on increasing the length of time between REM states. And fewer REMs at night, times when you feel like you're sleeping well but feel like your body has difficulty relaxing, in order to be a problem.""

Therefore, both **A: Guddaayu waxtu gu wàññeeku ci diggënte état REM yi (Decreased length of time between REM states)** and **B: REM yu wàññeeku ci guddi (Decreased REMs at night)** are negative effects of disturbed dreams, according to the passage. However, the passage specifically states that *fewer* REMs are a problem, and that dreams focus on *increasing* the length of time between REM states.  Therefore, A and B are true negative effects.

C: Di sukkëndiku ci ay géent yu leer (Relying on lucid dreams) - This is mentioned as influencing the effect but is not directly stated to be a negative effect on the body.

D: Yokkute REMs ci guddi (Increased REMs at night) - This is the opposite of what the passage describes as problematic.

Given the wording of the passage, and the need to choose the best fit, the most direct answer is **B: REM yu wàññeeku ci guddi (Decreased REMs at night)**.

"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, naka la ekip yu tegu ci yoon ak ekip virtuel yii nuroowee?","The correct answer is **A: Ñaari ekip yi yëpp dañuy xaree ci ñoom ñu liggéey ci benn tolluwaay** (Both teams strive to work in one tolluwaay).

Here's why:

* The passage states that ""kureel yu nu dul giss"" (virtual teams) are often formed ""ci mboolo buy feeñ te jëmmadi sen liggéey melni tomb xamee ngir sen tolluway mboolo bu jamp"" (in visible groups and make their work physical like a tomb to get to their destination).
* The passage does not say that both team types report to a virtual group, that they work in the same time zone, or that they both have diverse standpoints for all of their work.

Therefore, only option A is supported by the text.
"
"Di sukkëndiku ci lu ñu bind, ban baat jëm ci ekip ci jëm ak ekip virtuel moo dul dëgg?","The correct answer is **D: Ay waxtu yu bokkul ndax bërëp yu wuute mën na jariñ ekip virtuel yi.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...Seen kureel yi mën nañoo dajé ci ay waxtu dëkk yu bokul li seen njiit yi di wuute.""  This directly relates to virtual teams being able to operate across different time zones and locations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ekip yu tegu ci yoon moom la ñu tamm yëkëti ci ap tolluwaay bu gëna kawe** - This isn't stated directly in the text. The passage speaks to how virtual teams might *appear*, but not necessarily their *intention* or where they are 'moved'.
* **B: Ekip virtuel yi dañuy jëf yeenisaay ni luy jokalante ak ekip yi ci jëm** - The passage does not state that they behave in the same manner as face to face teams.
* **C: Ekip yu tegu ci yoon otonomi gu ndaw la ñu am wuuteeg ekip virtuel yi** - There's no information to suggest face to face teams have a *lower* amount of autonomy. It touches upon autonomy in relation to the collective vs the individual.
"
Ban ci yii toop moo dul lenn lu ay mbir yu ëmb teori di jublu?,"The passage focuses on internal desires and needs that motivate people's actions. Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Ay bëgg bëgg yu bees yuy antu ci àtu magg (New desires that come with age):** This aligns with the idea that internal desires evolve as people mature, which the passage mentions.
*   **B: Naka la dëkkuwaayu ñeen mëna sopee seeniy jëfin (How the environment can change their behavior):** This is about external influences, while the passage focuses on internal factors.
*   **C: Ay soxla yu ñu am ci biir (Internal needs):** This is a direct match to the central theme of the passage.
*   **D: Jëli lu nit ñi bëgg (To meet people's desires):** This is a restatement of motivations

Option B (Naka la dëkkuwaayu ñeen mëna sopee seeniy jëfin) is about external influences (the environment), while the passage is about internal factors driving motivation. Thus, it is the correct answer.

**Therefore, the answer is B.**"

The passage states that improvements in lens design allow zoom lenses to produce images that are comparable in quality to prime lenses (lenses with a fixed focal length). This corresponds directly to option C.
"
"Di sukkëndiku ci xebaar bi ci lu ñu bind, kañ la ap lentiy zoom di gën ap lentiy bu njëkk?","The correct answer is **D: Sooy gën di wër ay jafe jafe ci guddaay bi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Li xawa doywaar ci zoom yi mooy bariwaayu focale bi ak limu mbir yi bokk objectif di tax ñu mêna yegg ci rëyaay bi ñu soxla ci focale yi..."" This translates to ""What's advantageous with zoom lenses is the variety of focal lengths and the fact that the lens allows us to achieve the focal length we need..."" This implies that zoom lenses are better when you need flexibility in focal length. Option D (avoiding problems with length) directly reflects this flexibility.

Here's why:

*   The passage focuses on individual experiences, direct connection with the divine, and inner transformations.

*   Option B, ""Di toop gis gis ci di ko jaaree ci seddoo jaar jaar yu ñu bokk dund"" emphasizes shared experiences. Mistisism as described in the passage leans more towards individual pursuit than communal validation.

Therefore, B is the option that doesn't fit the description of Mistisism in the text."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kan moo tambali ap askanu mbay?","The correct answer is **C: Mbooloom Maori yu Polynésie**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the ""Maori from Polynesia"" theory claimed that they took New Zealand from the Moriori and established an agricultural society there. This implies that it was this group that started an agricultural society."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, mbooloo mi rëboon moas ñoo nekkoon ñu njëkkoon a dëkk ci ban bërëp?","The correct answer is **B: Nouvelle-Zélande**.

Ci ban xew la di jëfëndikoo ay jumtukaayu origami Pureland di amee njariñ ngir booleeb denc bi?,"Correct answer: A

Reasoning:

Pureland origami is designed to be simple and accessible, particularly for those with difficulties. The fact that the ""booleeb denc bi"" (storage group) needs to create many origami storage units at once suggests efficiency is key. Pureland origami is efficient because it uses only one fold per step, which makes it ideal for creating lots of items. It doesn't matter if they are beginners. 

*   B is incorrect because advanced skills are not the focus of Pureland origami.
*   C is incorrect because Pureland origami is intended to be simple, not complex with elaborate folds.
*   D is incorrect because the number of prior attempts is not relevant to whether Pureland origami is useful."

"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban bërëp moom la ñu boolewul ak Civilisation wu Vallée bu Indus?","The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the Harappan culture is *named after* Harappa, a major site. It doesn't exclude Harappa from being part of the Indus Valley Civilization. It's the opposite – it's a key site *within* the civilization.
* The rest of the options are mentions in the original paragraph:
    *   Pakistan and sections of the northwest of India: states that the Indus Valley Civilization covers most of modern-day Pakistan and areas in the northwest of India.
    *   East Afghanistan: states that it covers areas in East Afghanistan.
    *   Sarasvati River: mentions the Sarasvati River and the possibility of calling the civilization the Indus-Sarasvati Civilization."
Ban ci tur ñuy lim moo bokkul ci Civilization Jamono Përëm bi ñu waxtaane ci bind mii?,"The passage mentions:

*   Indus Valley Civilization (Civilisation Jamono Përëm)
*   Indus-Sarasvati Civilization (Civilisasion Indus-Sarasvati)
*   Harappan Civilization (Civilisasion Harappéenne) - named after Harappa.
*   Civilisation Dexub Indus (Translation of Indus River Civilisation )

The passage does not explicitly mention ""Civilisation Vallée wu Indus"".

So the correct answer is **D: Civilisasion Vallée wu Indus**"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop mooy indi ap njariñ buy yàgg?","The correct answer is **A: Liggéey ak ñeneen ñi (Working with others)**.

The passage (P) states that self-interest will always be with us, but that collaborative efforts (""liggéey ak ñeneen"") are ultimately more beneficial and sustainable.  The passage explicitly says that people will realize working with others is a better long-term choice.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop la kenn mëna jiitël su seen jublukaay nekkee ci jariñu bu gaaw?","The correct answer is **D: Siis**.

Here's why:

* **The argument:** The passage argues that selfishness will always be present, but collaboration is ultimately a better long-term strategy.  It suggests that people will eventually realize that working together leads to better and more lasting outcomes.

* **The question:** The question asks what people might *initially* prioritize if their goal is immediate gain.

* **Why ""Siis"" (Selfishness) is the answer:** The passage *explicitly states* that selfishness is a natural inclination (""Foqole ak bopp-sa-bopp dina wey di nekk ci ñun ba fàww""). Therefore, if someone is looking for immediate benefit, selfishness is the most likely initial driver. The other options are all related to collaboration, which the passage argues is a better *long-term* strategy, not an immediate one.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kan moo muur ap waal bu am solo ci depensuu xare gi?","The correct answer is **D: Mbooloom Philippin (The Filipino people)**.

The text clearly states that the Filipino people were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime, which covered a significant portion of the war expenses.
"
Ban diir moo jiitu jàmonowu Templier yi?,"The correct answer is **C: Diggu àt yu jiitu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the Templars were founded within the High Middle Ages (11th, 12th, and 13th centuries).
*   The High Middle Ages *followed* the Early Middle Ages.
*   Therefore, the period *before* the Templars' era (within the High Middle Ages) was the Early Middle Ages (Diggu àt yu jiitu).
* Njeexteeb Diggu àt ya corresponds with the Late Middle Ages, which is a later period, meaning the other options are all wrong."
Ban jàmono moo ñëw apare àtub Templier yi?,"The correct answer is **A: Atum Moyen Age bu mujj bi**.

The passage states: ""Atum Moyen Age bu kawe moo topp atum Moyen Age bu suufe, te **Atum Moyen Age bu mujj bi moo ci top**"". This directly translates to ""The High Middle Ages follows the Early Middle Ages, and the **Late Middle Ages follows it**."" Since the question asks what period came after the era of the Knights Templar (which falls within the High Middle Ages), the answer is the Late Middle Ages.
"
Ban faj walla yoon mooy bu ñu limul ni bu doktoor yi di jëfëndikoo ak chirurgien yi ci jàmono ampiiru Romain?,"The passage mentions:

*   The use of morphine extracted from poppy seeds.
*   The use of scopolamine extracted from henbane seeds.
*   Amputation to save infected limbs.
*   The use of tourniquets and bronze clamps to stop bleeding.

Option A isn't mentioned in the text. Therefore, the correct answer is A.
"

The passage focuses on the medical advancements made thanks to the military and the establishment of a paid medical corps. While military campaigns certainly existed, the passage doesn't identify them as a specific medical achievement. Options A, C, and D are directly mentioned or heavily implied in the text as achievements.
"
Lan mooy mën mënu gis yaakaar ci?,"The correct answer is **C: Ap yeg yeg ci yenn guddaayu onde yi**.

Here's why:

* **P** states that organisms have different capabilities in how they perceive and react to waves. The question is asking ""what is vision, in essence?"".
* **A** is incorrect because it refers to the subjective experience, not the fundamental nature of sight.
* **B** is too broad; while organisms need to see for survival, it doesn't define vision itself.
* **D** is incorrect, as it describes varied difficulties, not vision.

The passage focuses on the different ways organisms perceive and process light, and **C** captures that essential element: vision involves sensing specific wavelengths of light.
"
Ci lan la definu copite bët sukkëndiku ci diggënte ay organism?,"The correct answer is **D: Wuuteeb organism bi** (The differences of the organism).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the differences between organisms:** The passage explicitly states ""Barina mbir yuñ tabax yu seeni man-man wuute, ni ñuy yëgee onde yi itam bokkul te ni ñu koy dundee itam wuute na..."" (There are many things they are built with that have different abilities, how they perceive waves is also different, and how they experience it is also different). This highlights that differences in organisms are crucial to how their vision systems are designed.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Yeg yegu guddaayu onde yi (Perception of the length of the waves):** While wavelength perception is a component of vision, the passage's main point is about the overall differences in how *different* organisms experience and process visual information.  It's not just about wavelengths.
* **B: Ay soxlawu organism bi (The needs of the organism):** An organism's needs certainly influence its sensory systems. However, the text focuses on the *differences in structures and functions* leading to varying visual experiences, not solely on needs.
* **C: Faanu metit (Pain threshold):** This is not related to the passage.

Therefore, the ""differences of the organism"" is the most appropriate and direct answer, as the entire text describes this very idea."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban baat jëm ci Sikhisme moo dul wone bu baax diine bi?","Let's analyze each option based on the provided text:

*   **A: Sikhisme jogee na ci ap xajële sekt ci biir cosaanu Indu yi:** The text says Sikhism originated ""ci mbootay bu bayéko ci biir aaday Hindu"" which translates to ""from a community that emerged within the Hindu tradition"". While the idea of ""emergence"" implies some level of distinction, the phrase ""xajële sekt"" (splinter sect) is too strong and potentially pejorative. It suggests a more radical separation than described.

*   **B: Guru bi nekk na ap faan bu am solo bu Sikhisme moom:** The text says ""Guru mooy anam bu gën fés ci diine Indo yi wante ci diine Sikh jël na ab solo bu nekk ndëgëlay gëm gëm sikh."" which translates to ""The Guru is a prominent aspect of Indo religions, but in the Sikh religion, it has taken on a central role as the basis of Sikh belief."" This accurately reflects the importance of Gurus in Sikhism.

*   **C: Juroom ñeenti guru toop nañu ci ki sànc diine bi, Guru Nanak:** The text says ""Yeneen fukk ak ñeenti guru topp ci."" which translates to ""Fourteen other gurus followed."" This means 14, not 9 followed Guru Nanak. This statement is therefore false.

*   **D: Yenn ci ay cosaanu Sikhisme sampu nañu ci Hindouisme:** The text says ""...nangu nañu ni seen diine jooju mingi juddoo cosaanu hindoue yi."" which translates to ""...recognize that their religion originates in Hindu origins."" This correctly reflects that Sikhism acknowledges roots in Hinduism.

Therefore, the statement that is *not* an accurate representation of Sikhism based on the text is **C: Juroom ñeenti guru toop nañu ci ki sànc diine bi, Guru Nanak** because the text mentions 14 gurus following Guru Nanak, not 9."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop la ñu jappee ap faan gu rëy bu yoonu ngëmu Sikh?","The correct answer is **A: Konseptu guru**.

Here's why:

*   The text specifically states: ""Guru mooy anam bu gën fés ci diine Indo yi wante ci diine Sikh jël na ab solo bu nekk ndëgëlay gëm gëm sikh."" (Guru is the most prominent form in Indian religions, but in the Sikh religion, it has taken a special importance to the fundamentals of Sikh faith). This directly emphasizes the central and unique role of the Guru concept in Sikhism.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Cosaani Indu (Hindu Origins):** While the text mentions that Sikhism originated within a Hindu cultural context, it also states that Sikhs consider their religion distinct from Hinduism. So, while important, the Hindu origin isn't *the* key aspect of Sikh religious practice.
*   **C: Baña nangu yeneen diine Indien yi (Not accepting other Indian religions):** The text doesn't imply that Sikhism rejects other Indian religions.
*   **D: Di làkk ci kàllaama Punjabi (Speaking in the Punjabi language):** While Punjabi is important to the Sikh tradition, the text emphasizes that ""Gurmat"" which means ""path of the Guru,"" not Punjabi language.

Therefore, the concept of the Guru is the most significant aspect of Sikh religious practice highlighted in the text.

This essentially means they seek stimulation because they can't focus or be stimulated by typical activities. ""Yëngël seeniy yuur"" translates to ""stimulate their brains"", which aligns with this explanation.

Ban ci yii toop moo dul wone bu baax gis gisu pasërel?,"The correct answer is **C: Xam nañu ko itam ni porosé sukkëndiku ci njàng (It is also known as scaffolding learning)**.

Here's why:

* **Scaffolding is NOT a learning process itself.** The passage explicitly states that scaffolding is NOT a ""peexem njàng"" (teaching method/learning process) but rather an ""ndimbal"" (aid/support). It facilitates learning, but isn't the core process.

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with the passage:

* **A: Pasërel mën nañu nekk virtuel (Scaffolding can be virtual):**  The passage mentions ""Esafodaas bu wirtuel"" (virtual scaffolding) as an example.
* **B: Ap ndimbël la te du ap tërëlinu njàng (It is an aid and not a learning framework):**  As explained above, the passage directly states this.
* **D: Pasërel yi dañu leen di jëfëndikoo ngir maye ndimbël ci bu ñuy tambali ap jaar jaaru njàng (Scaffolding is used to provide assistance when starting a learning journey):**  Scaffolding is about providing support, especially initially, to help learners tackle new or challenging tasks.

Therefore, option C incorrectly describes scaffolding as a learning process.

"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban jumtukaayu Myspace moo mëna jariñ ndongo yu am jafe jafe ak jàng?","The correct answer is **C: Benn adaress web**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""Benn adres Web rek ngay joxe nga mëna yegg ci xët wii, moo tax xel daf koy yomba jàpp, dina itam yombal liggéey bi ndongo yi am jafe-jafe ak seen clavier wala yi am jafe-jafe xam ni ñu koy bindee."" This translates to ""Having just one web address that allows you to access the entire page makes it easier to understand and makes the work of students who have difficulty with their keyboard or those who have difficulty knowing how to write it easier."" The passage is directly linking the single web address to making it easier for students with certain learning difficulties."

Lan la ñu mëna gis ca Giza Plateau bi?,"The correct answer is **D: Piramid bu Màgg bi**, but **A: Ay baamel and B: Ay tempal** are also part of the things you can find in Giza Plateau.

The passage explicitly mentions:

*   Piramid yu bare (including Pyramid bu Mag bi)
*   Ay sëg yu ndaw yu bare
*   Ay jàngu (which can be considered temples)
*   Sphinx gu mag gi
*   Ay baamel (yeneen pyramide yu ndaw, bàmmeel ak ay temple yu gëna ndaw lañu tabax ngir delloo njukkal jgéen ñi ak njabootu Khéops)"

Kan moo yeloo suñu xam-xamu piromane bu yàkkoon tempal bi?,"The correct answer is **A: Waa Efes yi (The Ephesians)**.

The passage states that the Ephesians, angered by Herostratus' act, decreed that his name should never be mentioned. This is the group that tried to erase the knowledge of the arsonist.
"
Ban mooy baat bu jub jëm ci tabaxaat kërup Artemis?,"The correct answer is **B: Tabaxaatoon nañu ko apare nguurup Aleksandar bu Màgg bi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Guinaw ba Alexander deewe, neegu jaamukaay bi dañuko tabaxaat ci atum 323 Lu Jiitu JC"" which means ""After Alexander died, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC"". This implies the rebuilding happened *after* Alexander's reign, not *during* it, but it was under the authority of the Empire.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   A: The passage states that Alexander offered to rebuild the temple, but his offer was refused.
*   C: Herostratus destroyed the temple. There's no mention of him being involved in rebuilding it. He would have been long dead at this point.
*   D: The passage states it was rebuilt in 323 BC, not 320 BC."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kañ mooy fan bu njëkk bu ap xeet doxee ci ñaari tànk?","The correct answer is **A: Juroom ñaari milyongu àt ca ganaaw**.

The text states ""Sahelanthropus meenna am mu dox ak ñaari tànk ci juroom ñaari miliyongi at ca gannaaw"" which translates to ""Sahelanthropus may have walked on two feet about seven million years ago"". This makes option A the correct response to when the first species walked on two legs.
"
Ban ci yii xeet ñoo tàmm di dox si ñaari tànk?,"The correct answer is **A: Sahélanthrope**.

The passage states that ""Sahelanthropus meenna am mu dox ak ñaari tànk ci juroom ñaari miliyongi at ca gannaaw"" (Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs seven million years ago). While other species like Australopithecus and Homo erectus are mentioned in relation to walking, the passage indicates that Sahelanthropus is the earliest potential bipedal hominid.
"
Lan la marine Almande bi doon jeema antul ci jàmono Ñaareelu Xareb àdduna?,"The correct answer is **B: Di tere Angalteer jot ay nit ak ay marsaandiis** (To prevent England from receiving people and merchandise).

The text states that the US was trying to transport people and supplies across the Atlantic to help England, and that the German navy was using submarines to try and stop this traffic. Therefore, the German navy was trying to prevent England from receiving those people and supplies.
"
"Di sukkëndiku ci xebaar bu ñu joxe ci lu ñu bind, ku gënoon a am ndam ak xare géej gi ci jàmono kampaañu bët gànnaaru Atlantik bi?","The passage states that the Allies (which include the Americans and the British/English) were trying to transport supplies to Britain, and the Germans were trying to stop them. It also says that if the Allies failed, Germany might have been able to defeat Britain. This implies that the Allies (Americans and the English) eventually won, as Germany didn't defeat Great Britain.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Angale yi ak Amerikin yi** (The English and the Americans).
"
Lan moo amulwoon ba Assyrien yi sampee jëfëndikoo gawar?,"The correct answer is **A: Toogu bi**.

The passage states: ""Tegu bi kenn defaragu kowoon, leegi nak jaabalkati Assyrie dañu dan xeex ci kaw ay fass yu amoul teg.""

This translates to: ""Saddles hadn't been invented yet, so the Assyrian cavalry fought on horses without saddles."" This directly indicates that the saddle was missing when the Assyrians first used cavalry.
"
Naka la xeex yuy jëfëndikoo ap gawar di xexee?,"The correct answer is **C: Ci kaw fas** (On horseback).

The passage clearly states: ""Kawalry mooy arme buy yéeg ci fas di xeex."" (Cavalry is an army that rides on horses to fight).
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, fan nga dul fekki ap situwayin wu Babylone bu yem?","The passage describes that people brought sacrifices to their gods and priests communicated the gods' wishes within ceremonies. It also mentions open-air courtyards (ëtt bu tijjeeku) and a sacred space where only priests could enter (neeg bu abe yi). Therefore, we can infer the following:

*   **A: Di indi ay sarax ci ëtu ap tempal (Bringing sacrifices to the courtyard of a temple):** The passage states that sacrifices were brought and the courtyard is mentioned. This is a likely scenario.
*   **B: Fekkee ap xew ci ap tempal bu njëkk (Attending an event at a primary temple):** The passage states ceremonies were held, so this is a likely scenario.
*   **C: Ci ap festival ci ëtu ap tempal (At a festival in the courtyard of a temple):** The passage states ceremonies were held, and a courtyard existed, so this is a likely scenario.
*   **D: Di indi ay sarax ci biir ap bërëp bu sell (Bringing sacrifices inside a sacred place):** The passage states that only priests could enter the inner sanctum (neeg bu abe yi). The general public would not bring sacrifices inside this area. Therefore, this is the least likely scenario.

The correct answer is **D**.
"
Ban ci yii toop la ñu doon jagleel bu baax sarxalkat yi?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: Ay bërëp yu sell ci biir**.

The text says that each temple had an outer court and an inner chamber that was *reserved for priests only*. This inner chamber is the ""bërëp bu abe yi di beru te ñoom rekk ñoo fay dugg"". Therefore, the inner sacred places were specifically dedicated to and reserved for the priests.
"
Kañ la Buur Toutankhamon siiwee?,"The correct answer is **C: Ba ñu gisee baameelam** (When his tomb was discovered).

The text states: ""Moonte, gisub sëgam ci atum 1922siwal na ko."" This translates to ""However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 revealed him."" Therefore, his fame came after the discovery of his tomb.
"
Lan moo def Buur Toutankhamon ap buuru Egypte bu ñëpp xam bu baax?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba ñu gisee baameelam bu ñu laalul**.

The passage explicitly states that Tutankhamun wasn't considered important in his time, nor was he listed in early king lists. His fame stems from the discovery of his intact tomb in 1922. The fact that it was largely untouched is what made the discovery so significant.
"
Lan la taalifkat Grec bi Homer mënutawoon a def?,"The text states that Homer was a ""taalifkat bu siiw bu bët yi muuru"", which means ""famous writer whose eyes were covered/blind"". Thus, Homer was unable to **see**.

Therefore, the answer is **B: Gis**.
"
Ban Grec bu siiw la ñu xamee lenn lu dul littérature?,"The correct answer is **C: Pythagoras**.

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses Homer, Sophocles, and Aristophanes as important figures in literature and theater.
*   It then introduces Pythagoras as a famous Greek *philosopher* known for his mathematical theorem. This is the only figure mentioned who is known for something other than literature."
Fan la njabootu Yawut yi doon nekk ci lu ëpp ci seeniy waxtu?,"The correct answer is **A: Ci bërëp yu ubbeeku**.

The passage states that houses were not very important in hot Eastern countries and that the most important part of Hebrew family life took place outside.
"

"
Ban ci yii toop la ñu limul ni lu wuute lu nekk ci diggënte réewu Scandinave yi?,"The correct answer is **B: Suuf si (The Land)**.

The passage explicitly mentions differences in:

*   Nit ñi (People)
*   Buur yi (Kings/Rulers)
*   Aada yi (Customs/Traditions)
*   Taariix bi (History)

Suuf si (The Land) is not explicitly mentioned as a point of difference between the Scandinavian countries.
"
Ñan ñoo njëkk sanc Groenlaand?,"The correct answer is **C: Erik mu Xonq** (Erik the Red).

The passage states: ""Ca tariix scandinaves ñoo ngii waxni Erik le Rouge dañuko toxal ci Islaand ngir faat bàkkan, Bimuy tukki ci sowwu, ci la gis Groenlaand dal diko tudde Groenlaand."" This translates to ""Scandinavian history says that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder. Traveling west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.""
"
Ban mbooloo mooy bëgg reer sang toogukaay?,"The correct answer is **C: Gooru Room yu am alal yi**

The passage states: ""bu jigéen ak néew ji doole ji toogee ciy chaise ngir lekk, boroom alal yi ñoom dañuy bëgg di toogandoo ci ay banquet"". This translates to ""women and the less powerful would sit on chairs to eat, while the wealthy preferred to recline at banquets"". So wealthy men are the ones who recline, not sit, while eating.
"
Ban ci yii toop moo dul bokk ci ap feetu Roomain yu yàgg?,"The correct answer is **D: Ap palaatu koppin bu ñu saaf** (A plate of seasoned turkey).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states ""te benn magetu Rome mëssul ñam tamit koppin"" (and no Roman aristocrat ever ate turkey). This means turkey was not part of their cuisine.
*   The passage states A: Lekk yu bari yuñ daan lekk moom la waa Rome daan lekk, waaye ñoom amoon nañu yeneen mbir yuñ daan faral di lekk ci seeni xew. This is similar to B, the passage also gives a list of what they did eat.
*   The passage states C: bu jigéen ak néew ji doole ji toogee ciy chaise ngir lekk, boroom alal yi ñoom dañuy bëgg di toogandoo ci ay banquet. This states how the rich men feasted
"
"Di sukkëndiku ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop mooy am ci lu ñu foogul ap liggéey buy sax?","The correct answer is **D: Ap cosaan civilisationnel** (A civilizational origin).

Here's why:

* **The passage defines civilization (siwikisasiyoŋ) as an origin/foundation (cosaan) that is shared by a large group of people.** It's the very first sentence.
* While communities (A), small origins (B), and countries (C) play a role, the passage emphasizes the broader civilizational origin as the fundamental concept.

Therefore, option D directly reflects the passage's definition of civilization as a shared origin/foundation.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, luy jiitu ap askan?","The correct answer is **A: Ap cosaan civilisationnel**

The text states: ""Siwikisasiyon benn cosaan la buñu séddale ci gurubu nit yu bari yu dëkk tey liigéeandoo ci ab koparaatif, aw askan."" This translates to ""Civilization is a common origin that is shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a cooperative, a nation.""

The question asks ""What comes before a nation?"". According to the text, it's ""Ap cosaan civilisationnel"" (a civilization origin).
"
Ban baat jëm ci Drukgyal Dzong moo dëgguwul?,"The correct answer is **C: Ap saafara moo yàq ndesitu foor yi**

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""ci atum 1951, ab **daay** dafa làkk lepp ba yenn desitu Drukgyal Dzong rekk nekk fa"" which translates to ""in 1951, a **fire** burned everything except some remains of Drukgyal Dzong"". It was fire, not a medicinal thing, that ruined the structures.

The other options are true based on the passage:

*   A: Dañu ko tabaxoon ngir feete ndamu doole Tibetan-Mongol yi - ""Wax nañu ni ci atum 1649, ci la Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel sos barab biñuy fattalikoo ndàm liñu am ci forsu Tibetan-Mongol"" - constructed to commemorate the victory over Tibetan-Mongol forces.
*   B: Mungi nekk ci Bhutan - ""Drukgyal Dzong beereeb bu yaxxu la ak keeruk Buddhist bi ci kaw Paro District (ci deekeeuk Phondey)."" - located in Paro District, Bhutan.
*   D: Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel moo ko sàkk - ""ci la Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel sos barab"" - Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel founded the place."

Ban ci baat yii toop jëm ci Cambodge moo dëggu?,"The correct answer is **D: Thaïlande yi yàqoon nañu Phnom Penh** (The Thai people destroyed Phnom Penh).

The passage states: ""Ci atum 1772, ñoo yàq Phnom Phen"" (In 1772, they destroyed Phnom Penh), and the sentence before that says ""Askanu Thaïs dugg nañu Cambodge yoon yu bari ci 18eelu xarnu ba ak ci atum 1772..."" (The Thai people entered Cambodia many times in the 18th century and in 1772...).  Therefore, it was the Thai people who destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772.

Ban ci yii toop la këru liggéeyukaay Néerlandaise bu penku Inde deful ci waxtu ba mu nekkeewoon ca Taïwan?,"The correct answer is **D: Pare ci di wacc njiitu Taiwan ci loxoy nguuru Qing**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the Qing dynasty took control of Taiwan in 1683. The Dutch East India Company was already active in Taiwan from 1624. So, the Dutch did not facilitate Taiwan's handover to the Qing dynasty.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Am ap bërëp ci faanu bëj-saalumu sowu bu dun bi:** The passage states, ""Ci atu 1624, Këru Liggéeyukaay bu penku bu Indë teg na benn daluwaay ci penk Taywaan""
*   **B: Liggéey ci di defare ay pepp ni ko autochtone yi di defare:** The passage states, ""door defar coppite ci wàllu pepp""
*   **C: Jël ay liggéeykat chinois ci seeniy tool:** The passage states, ""jël baykatu waa Chine yi ngir ñu liggéey ci tooli ceeb ak suukaram yi."""

The text states: ""Ci atum 1895, guinaw biñu ñàkkee xare bi amoon digante Sinuwaa yi ak Sapone yi (1894-1895), nguuru Qing bi xaatim na Sàrtu Shimonoseki, binga xamni dafa jox dogal bimu amone ci kaw Taywan wa Sapoŋ bi jiite dun bi ba 1945.""

This translates to: ""In 1895, after losing the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which transferred its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, who ruled the island until 1945.""

This clearly indicates that the Treaty of Shimonoseki granted Japan control over Taiwan.

Ban ci baat yii toop moo dul wone ci bu baax ap mbooloom gaynde?,"The correct answer is **D: Mën nañoo réye te mën nañoo dëkk ak nit itam** (They can kill and they can also live with humans).

Here's why:

*   **A: Dañuy jëfee ni ay mbooloom xaj (They behave like packs of dogs):** The passage explicitly states that lion behavior *resembles* that of dogs and hyenas. This implies a similarity in their social structure and hunting tactics, making this a valid characteristic.

*   **B: Ratio goor ak jigéen yi toloowul (The ratio of men and women is unequal):** The passage states that a pride consists of ""one or three males, and a dozen or so females and young"". This clearly shows an imbalance in the male-to-female ratio.

*   **C: Goor yi ak jigéen yi ñoom ñëpp a bokk jegeendoo (The men and women are all closely related):** The passage mentions ""a family of sisters and aunts and extended young"". This indicates that the females are closely related, and though it doesn't explicitly say the males are related to the females, the context implies a social unit where close relations are highly probable, especially since the pride is formed with only a few males.

*   **D: Mën nañoo réye te mën nañoo dëkk ak nit itam (They can kill and they can also live with humans):** The passage does *not* discuss whether or not lions can live with humans, or how they interact with humans. This statement is not supported by the text."

Ban ci yii toop moo dul wone ci bu baax ap segg? ,"The correct answer is **B: Dañuy dox ndànk (They walk slowly)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""téy dém ci lu gaaw, tamit"" (and they move quickly, also). This directly contradicts the idea that they walk slowly.

Let's look at the other options:

*   A: Mën nañoo rëb bu baax bu guddi jotee (They can hunt well at night): This is supported by the passage saying ""Mën nañu giss bu baax ci lëndëm bi ak ay gisinu guddi"" (They can see well in the dark with their night vision).
*   C: Seen nooyikaayu xet dafa néew doole (Their prey choice is limited): This is not entirely false. The passage says that ""Ocelots dafa topp eguis ay rab yu muy lekk(li muy rëb) ci xet, xentu ngir fu nu nekk ci suuf ci"" (Ocelots follow the type of prey they eat, according to location). Although they hunt a variety of small animals, their preference is dependent on the prey available in the area. Therefore, this statement may be assumed from the text, making it a false statement for the prompt.
*   D: Dañuy bëgg di rëb mala yu gëna ndaw yi (They like to hunt smaller animals): The passage explicitly says ""Mën nañu wax ni mala yu ségg yi di rëbb yépp ñoo leen gëna tuuti ñoom ci seen bopp"" (You can say that all the animals that ocelots hunt are smaller than them)."
Ban ci yii toop la ñu dul jappee ni kàttanu segg bu gëna rëy?,"The correct answer is **A: Yuuxu**.

The passage describes the tiger's physical capabilities (leaping, swimming, jumping, carrying heavy objects) and its classification within the Panthera genus alongside lions, leopards, and jaguars. It also mentions their roaring ability. The question asks about the tiger's greatest strength. While the passage mentions roaring, it does not present it as a measure of physical strength. The other options (leaping, jumping, carrying) are explicitly described as capabilities that involve physical strength.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop mooy lu wuute ci dëggënte segg yi ak gaynde yi?","The correct answer is **B: Baatu seeniy yuuxu** (The sound of their roars).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Yuxuk ségg bokkul yuxuk gayndé"" (The roar of a tiger is different from the roar of a lion). This makes it the most direct difference mentioned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mën mënu feey (Ability to pounce):** The passage says tigers ""mën na yéeg (xarañu ci noonu), féey"" (are skilled in attack, pounce), but doesn't say anything about lions being unable to. We don't know if it's different or the same.
* **C: Guddaay bu ñu mëna tëb (The length they can jump):** The passage says tigers ""tëb lu sori lool"" (jump very far), but doesn't compare this to lions.
* **D: Seen dooley këcc (Their biting force):** The passage states how strong a tiger's bite is, but makes no comparison to the biting force of a lion.

Therefore, the only difference explicitly stated in the passage is the sound of their roars.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu wax, lan la Robert Hooke def balaa yeneen biologist yi?","The correct answer is **A: Seetlu selul yu dee yi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states that Robert Hooke observed ""carré yu ndaw yu defaree liege"" (small squares that make up cork) through a microscope and that these squares resembled cells. Cork is dead plant tissue, therefore he observed dead cells. The passage doesn't explicitly say that he understood the cell as the fundamental unit of life (D), or that he observed a living organism (B). It also provides more specific detail of what he found, versus the vaguer answer of just ""xool ay kaarewal yu ndaw"" (C)."
Lan la cosaanu baat bii di “selul” di firndeel?,"The answer is **B: Ay neeg yu ndaw**

The passage clearly states: ""Selill mu ngi jogé ci turu latin cella muy tekki néeg bu ndàw."" (Cell comes from the Latin word cella which means small room/chamber).
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lu ëp ci mala yi am nañu mën mënu def lan?","The answer is **B: Yëngëtu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Mala yu bari mën nañu **yëngëtu**"" (Many animals can move). While some animals can fly, swim, or dig, the passage explicitly mentions that **many** animals can move, implying it is a more general and widespread capability than the others."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan la yenn mala yi amul?","The correct answer is **C: Yuur yi** (Brains).

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""Mala yi kese ñoo am xel (donte du sax mala yépp; pul-pul, ci missal, amu ñu xel).""  This translates to: ""Only some creatures have brains (although not all creatures; starfish, for example, do not have brains).""
* The passage indicates that *some* creatures don't have brains (xel), but all the other characteristics (cells, ability to reproduce, ability to eat) are implied to be common to all creatures.

Therefore, the thing that *some* creatures lack is brains (yuur yi).
"
Lan mooy dimbali garab yi ci seen yoonub fotosintes?,"The correct answer is **D: Naaj** (Sun).

The passage states that plants make food using sunlight through photosynthesis. Therefore, sunlight is crucial for photosynthesis.
"
Lan la nit ñi di génnee bu ñuy noyyi bu garab yi di noyyi?,"The correct answer is **D: Gaas karbonik** (Dioxide de carbon).

The passage states: ""...ñu jël dioxide de carbon bi nit yi di génne (mooy, noyyi)."" which means that humans exhale carbon dioxide.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii misaal mooy teye ji yoonub yokkute bi?","The correct answer is **A: Ap mbooloo mu ndaw muy lajj ci di tekki ci ap bërëp bu bees.**

Here's why:

The passage describes speciation as starting with a small group becoming isolated and adapting to a new environment. Option A directly reflects this initial step:

*   **P:** ""Su am kurréel bu kuréel mbir yuy dundu (askan bu ndàw) xaajaloo na ak askan bi gëna am solo bu bawoo ci ... dina faral di gis seen bopp ci barab bu wuuteek liñu nekkoon bu njëkk.""
    *(If a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it came ... they will often find themselves in a place different from where they were before.)*

Let's eliminate the other options:

*   **B: Ap waalub benn askan miy dem ci ap diwaan bu bees:** While moving to a new region is a part of it, it doesn't emphasize the *isolation* and small size of the initial group that is so crucial for speciation.
*   **C: Ap askan miy defar ap bokkam ci ap diwaan bu bees:** This is about changing of the habitat or environment.
*   **D: Benn askan miy mujjee nekk ñaar:** This is the *result* of speciation, not the initial trigger. The passage discusses the process *leading up to* the point where one population becomes two distinct species.

Therefore, **A** best represents the initial event that sets the stage for speciation, according to the given text."
Ban ci baat yii toop moo dul wone bu baax nu ñuy defaree ay xeet yu bees yuy dund? ,"Ci biir xalaat bi, li gën a neex moo di D: ""Feeñam mënu ñoo koo moytu"". Loolu moo gën a neex ndax day wax ci ni spéciation, wala defar xeet yu bees, nekk na mbir mu mënul ñàkk su àdduna di dox.
"
Ban waal ci doxalinu sistem bi mooy yoobu deret ci xol mi?,"Correct answer: D: Vén yi

**Explanation:**

The text states that blood *returns* to the heart through vessels called ""xëtër."" ""Xëtër"" translates to ""veins"" in Wolof.
"
Yan tub ñoo nekk yu gëna ndaw ci doxalinu sistem bi?,"The correct answer is **D: Jëmm yi**.

The passage states: ""Yoon yi geenee ndaw ñoogi tuddu kapileer"" which translates to ""The narrowest vessels are called capillaries"". ""Jëmm yi"" is the translation of ""capillaries"".

Therefore, the answer is **D**.
"
Mën mënu ap gunoor ci di lem seeniy laaf ca ganaaw lan lay yokk ci yii toop?,"The passage states that Soccant (gunóor) who can close their wings (laaf) over their body have many small places to hide from dangerous parasites (dafkati yu bon).

Therefore, the ability to close their wings (lem seeni laaf) provides:

*   **B: Ay bërëpu nëbbukaay (Places to hide)**

So the answer is **B**."
Ban ci yii toop la ñu waxul ci biir lu ñu bind ni lenn lu mën mënu naaw bu ap gunoor laal?,"The passage discusses how the ability of gunóor (birds) to fly helps them escape predators and find food and mates. It also mentions their ability to fold their wings to protect themselves from parasites.

Looking at the options:

*   **A: Yokkute (Growth):** This isn't mentioned in the context of their ability to fly or their wings.
*   **B: Diirup dund (Lifespan):**  The passage doesn't discuss how long they live in relation to their flight.
*   **C: Dajale lekk (Collecting food):** The passage directly states flight allows them to ""am luñuy lekk ak ay nataangoo ci anam bu gëna baax,"" implying they collect food more effectively.
*   **D: Xarañ (Speed):**  The passage implies speed is a benefit of their flight (""rëcc ci lu yomb seeni noon"" - easily escape enemies)

Therefore, the answer is **B: Diirup dund (Lifespan)**. It's the only option not related to the benefits mentioned in the passage about a gunoor's flight.

"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban faan ci ap garabu cycas benn Triceratops di mëna lekk?","The text says: ""Benn Triceratops meenna jeefee ndiko koppam bu mak ngir genné xob yi laata lékk gnam bi."" This translates to: ""A Triceratops might use its large beak to remove the leaves before eating the plant.""

Therefore, the answer is **A: Xob yi di jamaate (The leaves)**.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop la ap Triceratops di mëna lekk ci bu woor? ","Based on the passage, the best answer is **D: Ap garab ak ay doom yu tooke**.

Here's why:

*   The passage says ""Yeneen xeltukat yi wax nanu ne garab yii dañoo bare tooke kon ci yoon benn dinosoor lekku ci, doonte tey abbu àll buy dox melni ku tàyyel ak yeneen xeeti rab yu melni seku(sëtu dinosoor yi) mën na lekk xob wal doom yu am tooke yi."" This indicates that while Triceratops probably didn't eat the toxic cycads, there is evidence that other animals ate leaves and fruits that had toxins."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii taagatu yaram yu toop moo gëna siiw ci diwaanu bët-gànnaar bu gëna sori ci Itali?","The text states that winter sports are more common in the northern regions of Italy. Of the options, only ice hockey (part of hockey ci glace) is a winter sport. However, Ice Hockey is not mentioned as an option. The text explicitly states that ""football, basket-ball, volley-ball, water-polo, escrime, rugby, course velo, hockey ci glace, roller hockey ak course auto F1"" are the most popular sports, and football is listed first. Thus, the most likely answer is football, even though it doesn't specifically say it's more popular than the others in the northern region.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: Futbal**.
"
"Di sukkëndiku ci xebaar bu ñu joxe ci lu ñu bind, ban ci faanu taagat yaram yii toop moo jotal Itali ap ndampaayu championwu àddina?","The text states that Italy won the FIFA World Cup in 2006. The FIFA World Cup is for football.

Therefore, the correct answer is A: Futbal.
"
Aparee ban xew-xew la yenn faanu Luxembourg nekke Belge?,"The correct answer is **B: Revolution Belge bi** (Belgian Revolution).

The text states that ""ci atI 1830 yi weesoo"" (in the 1830s) ay xaaj yu nekk Belsik dañoo bokkoon ci Liksambuur (parts of Belgium used to belong to Luxembourg). That decade is when the Belgian Revolution happened.
"
Ban ci yii toop ñoo laal ñàkk bokk bu Luxembourg?,"The text discusses events that impacted Luxembourg's independence or lack thereof. Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: Occupation Almand (German Occupation):** The text explicitly states Luxembourg was occupied by Germany during both World Wars, which certainly impacted its independence.
*   **B: Bokk ci Union Européenne bi (Membership in the European Union):** While important, joining the EU doesn't directly relate to Luxembourg *losing* its independence.
*   **C: Revolution Belge bi (Belgian Revolution):** The text says parts of modern Belgium used to belong to Luxembourg but broke away during the Belgian Revolution. This means Luxembourg lost territory but this contributes to it becoming a country with defined borders.
*   **D: Nekk ap réew mu tembe (Being an independent country):** This is the opposite of lacking independence.

Based on the information provided, the best answer is the one that explicitly states Luxembourg *lost* it's independence for a period of time, which is during German Occupation.

**Therefore, the correct answer is A.**"
Ñaata kilomeetar karé wu yaatuwaayu Turquie yëpp ñoo nekk ci Europe?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The text states: ""23 764 kaare kilometres (9 174 sq mi) ci Ërop"".
"
"Ci kaw lu ñu wax, ñaata kilomeetar la guddaayu Turquie?","The correct answer is **A: 1600**.

The text states: ""Suufuk Turkey ëpp na 1 600 kilometres (1 000 mi) ci guddaay...""

The text states: ""...Lante Latin mom lañuy jëfandikoo yennsaay ci xew xewu diine yi."" (Latin is used sometimes in religious events.)
"
"Ci dëkkum Vatican, lan la ñu dul jëfëndikoowulee kàllaama Italien?","Ci tekkiwaay bi, wax nanu ni ""Latin mom lañuy jëfandikoo yennsaay ci xew xewu diine yi."" Loolu feeñal ni Italien duñu ko jëfandikoo ci xew xewu diine yi.

"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii mooy jariñoo ci mixe soon ci ay ordinatër yu xarañ?","The correct answer is **A: Musik**.

The original text explicitly mentions ""aristé musik jaralé ko ci ay ordinater yu rafet ngir defar ak jaxasé ay son,"" which translates to ""artists use computers to create and mix sounds."" This directly relates to music.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lu ëp ci kër yi ci ban bërëp la wanag yi amee chasu ndox?","The answer is **A: Mohenjo-daro**.

The passage states: ""Dëkki Harappa ak Mohenjo-dar am na benn wanag bu xonk cii daana ka kër gu nekk, nu boole ko ci benn yoonalinu ndox muu bonn mu mucc ayub."" This translates to ""The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a private well in the courtyard of each house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.""
"
Ci yan bërëp yii toop la ñu gisoon ay tërëlinu foos yu yees?,"According to the text:

*   **Harappa** is mentioned as having advanced sewage systems.
*   **Santorini** is mentioned within the context of Minoan settlements with bathtubs and drainage.
*   **Egypt** and **China** are mentioned as having had bathtubs.

The question asks where *advanced sewage systems* were found. While bathtubs are mentioned in relation to Minoan settlements (including Santorini), Egypt and China, only Harappa is explicitly associated with advanced sewage systems. Therefore, the best answer is:

**A: Harappa**
"
Ban ci yii toop mooy tax ba ap patiinkat mëna wëndeelu?,"D'après le texte, la raison pour laquelle le patineur peut tourner est due à la forme de la lame du patin :

*   Elle a deux bords et un creux entre eux.
*   Ces deux bords rendent le patineur instable.
*   La lame est légèrement courbée, et le bord qui touche la glace est aussi courbé.
*   Si le patin va à droite, le patineur tourne à droite, et vice versa.

Donc, la réponse correcte est **A: Mbir mu roon bi ci suufu wéñu patiin bi** (La forme incurvée de la lame du patin)."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop mooy wone ci bu baax pax mi nekk ci kaw wéñu patiinwu galaas bu mingoog jàmono?","The correct answer is **C: Konkav**

Here's why:

*   **P describes the problem:** The passage describes a skate where the edges are too sharp (""xóot xóot"") and the edges are slightly concave (curved inwards - ""dëng tuuti""). This makes the skate unstable.
*   **Q asks:** Which of the options best describes the flaw in the modern skate's blade?
*   **Konkav** is the best fit because the skate's cutting edge is not perfectly straight which makes the skates unstable.

Let's eliminate the other options:

*   **A: Wuy dagg ci ñaari boor yi (Cutting two edges):** While the passage mentions two edges, the problem isn't simply that there are two edges. It's the sharpness and shape of those edges that is the problem.
*   **B: Roon (Round):** The passage says the skate edge are sharp and unstable, round wouldn't fit
*   **D: Dëng (Thin):** It's not simply the thinness of the blade, but its shape which causes the issue."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan mooy yoon miy bàyyi xarefulwoon yi ñu dog kàttan mi ëp ci leer gi?","The correct answer is **B: Di génnee ay foton yu ñu junj**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that atoms release energy in the form of photons ( ""atom yi leeray bi mo leen sooke, indi joxe fotonwu leeraay""). The passage says ""atom yi génnee ay photons"".

The other options are incorrect because the passage doesn't mention anything about 'ceeneeral' being related to releasing energy, it states photons are released."
Lan mooy tax ap xarefulwoon di génnee ap foton?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: Tolluwaayu kàttan gu dalul.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that to regain their original energy, they must release excess energy in the form of photons. This implies that the atom is initially in a state of higher energy and needs to release some to return to a lower, more stable state.
*   The process is described as ""induced emission,"" where light strikes the atoms, which then release photons. This further supports the idea that the atoms are in an excited state (higher energy) and release photons to return to a more stable, lower energy state.

Let's eliminate the other options:

*   **A: Di génnee kàttan gu ëp:** The atom is releasing energy, not generating more.
*   **B: Junj yu leer gu ëp indi:** While light is involved, the emission of photons is the result of the atom releasing energy, not the other way around.
*   **D: Ap tolluwaay jëf yu neexul:** This option doesn't align with the scientific explanation of energy levels and photon emission described in the text."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan mooy warali ap lamp bañatee dox?","The correct answer is **C: Wéñ bi nekk ci biir lamp bi di tàkk** (The filament inside the bulb broke).

The passage states ""...Biñu amalee ay téemeri waxtuy liggéey filament bi nekk ci bulbe bi dafa mujjee làkk bole ci bulbe bu leer bi doxatul."" which translates to ""After several hours of use, the filament inside the bulb broke, causing the light bulb to stop working.""
"
Ban ci yii toop moo mëna doon lu woorula laal ci booy palaasewaat ap lamp?,"Response: B: Kontaktu lamp bi
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan mooy xew bu ap noyau xajëloo?","The correct answer is **B: Kàttan mooy génne (Energy is released)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Xaru xóox bi dafay bayyi waat benn xaaj ci enersi bi."" This directly translates to ""The sliding snowball releases a part of the energy.""  This indicates energy is released when a nucleus fissions.
"
Ban ci yii toop mooy wone woote yi ci diggënte ay bërëp yu sorentoo lool jëm ci suuf,"The correct answer is **B: Satelit yi**.

The passage explicitly states ""So woowee kenn ku la sore ay junniy kilomeetar, yaa ngi jëfandikoo satelit"" (If you're calling someone thousands of kilometers away, you're using satellites). This directly links satellites to long-distance communication. The other options are incorrect based on the passage:

*   **A: Teleskop yi (Telescopes):** Telescopes are used for observing space and are mentioned in the context of atmospheric distortion.
*   **C: Leer yi (Lights):** Lights are not discussed in the context of long distance communications.
*   **D: Roket yi (Rockets):** Rockets are used to launch satellites, but they are not the means of communication itself."
Ban ci yii la ñuy jëfëndikoo ngir yoobu ap teleskop ci biir jàwwu ji?,"The correct answer is **B: Roket yi**.

The passage states: ""Fusée moo yóbbu satellite bi ci jawwu ji."" (Rockets take the satellite into the atmosphere.) Telescopes, like satellites, need to be launched into space.
"
Ban la ñu wara bind jëm ci ap xew xew siklik ngir mëna toop ni waxtu bi di demee?,"The best answer is **B: Nu muy delusiwaatee (How it repeats)**

Here's why:

*   **P** defines a cyclical event as one that happens and repeats continuously.
*   To track time's passage in relation to a cyclical event, you'd need to monitor its repetitions or cycles.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Diir bi (Duration):** While duration is related to time, it doesn't directly address the cyclical nature of the event.
*   **C: Laal (Touch/Impact):** This refers to how time affects things and isn't about tracking the cycle.
*   **D: Jafe jafe (Difficulty/Challenges):** This is irrelevant to tracking time based on a cyclical event.

**Therefore, B is the most fitting answer.**
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban faanu ap xew la ñuy jëfëndikoo waxtoom ngir mingële?","The correct answer is **A: Guddaay (Length/Duration)**.

The passage states that time is used to ""mingale diir xew-xew yi"" which translates to ""associate the duration of events."" ""Guddaay"" most accurately reflects duration or length.
"

Ci ban réew la gaalu Trygvasson yi jogeewoon?,"The correct answer is **D: Norvège**.

The text states, ""Ki jiite woon gaal googu mooy Olaf Trygvasson, kenn ci doomi Norvége..."" which translates to ""The leader of that fleet was Olaf Trygvasson, a native of Norway...""
"
Ci ban waxtu ci taariix la Almaañ amee ap jiitël bu rëy ci cosaanub Estonie?,"The passage states that the interaction between Estonian culture and German influence was strong ""ci 15eelu xarnu bi,"" which translates to ""in the 15th century.""

To determine which answer choice is correct, we need to calculate how many years ago the 15th century was from the present (assuming the present is approximately 2024).

The 15th century spans the years 1401 to 1500. Let's take the middle of that range, roughly 1450.

2024 - 1450 = 574 years.

The closest answer choice to 574 years is ""C: Ci boorup 600 àt ca ganaaw"" (Approximately 600 years ago).

Therefore, the correct answer is C.
"
Kàllaama Estonie lan moo ko junjoon?,"The correct answer is **B: Alfabet wu Almaañ**.

The text states that the literary Estonian language was based on the German alphabet, with the addition of one letter. Therefore, the German alphabet was a key component given to the Estonian language.

The passage states: ""Gni ñu jàpp ni ñoo namm làkk wi mën na wuute, lépp di aju ci ndax dañu ciy boole ñiy làkk rakki làkk wi (dialecte)."" This directly explains why the estimate of Hindi speakers varies - because it depends on whether or not dialects are included in the count.

Ban ci yii toop moo di ap baat bu dëggu jëm ci kàllaama Hindi ak Ourdou?,"The correct answer is **B: Dañu wuute ci bind** (They differ in writing).

The passage states: ""Indo yi ak Urdu yi dañoo niiro ci seen bind waaye ci dañoo wuute ci xeetu bindiin"" which translates to ""Hindi and Urdu are similar in their speech but differ in their writing system.""
"
Ban ci yii toop moo nekkul ap mbir mu dëggu jëm ci alfabet Hangeul gi?,"Correct answer: **B: Turu alfabet bi bu njëkk moo doon Hunan Jeongeum**

Explanation:

*   The passage states the original name was ""Hunmin Jeogeum,"" not ""Hunan Jeongeum.""

The other options are true based on the passage:

*   **A: Dañu ko sàkkoon ci ndoorteelu nguuru Buur Sejong**- The alphabet was created in 1444 when Sejong was king.
*   **C: Ñeenteelu buur bi ci nguurup Joseon moo ko sàkkoon**- Sejong was the fourth king.
*   **D: Daraa tax ñu sàkk ko**- The reason for its creation was to teach the people."
Alfabet Hunmin Jeongeum sopiwoon nañu ko ngir mu doon lan?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

The passage states that the alphabet Hunmin Jeongeum was later renamed Hangeul.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, yan kàllaama la Sanskrit junj?","The correct answer is **D: Ay kàllaama Indien** (Indian Languages).

The passage states that many new Indian languages originated from Sanskrit, similar to how many European languages originated from Latin. Therefore, Sanskrit is related to Indian languages.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, nu ñu doon jëfëndikoowee Sanskrit wàññeekuwoon na ndax lan?","The correct answer is **A: Laxasoo** (Mbiru maas).

The passage states: ""Bu dencu téere Upanishads weesoo, Sanskrit dafa reer rekk ndax mbiru maas."" This directly translates to after the Upanishads, Sanskrit diminished due to ""mbiru maas"" which you translated as Laxasoo, meaning it faded due to mass.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop mooy ap baat bu dëggu jëm ci gravite ci Io?","The correct answer is **B: Gravité bu Io mooy gëna këcc, liy waral nga wara peese lu neew.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that you would weigh less on Io compared to Earth. This is because Io has a weaker gravitational pull.
*   Option B accurately reflects this weaker pull and its consequence on weight.
*   The other options are either factually incorrect based on the passage or misrepresent the relationship between gravity and weight.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci baat yii mooy wone ci bu baax muurukaayu weer bi nekk ci biti?","Correct answer is **B: Krut bi moo gëna sew ci suufu tund yu kawe yi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Ci suufu maria la gëna woyofee, gëna dijj ci kaw plateau yi."" (It's thinner in maria regions and thicker on plateaus). Plateaus are similar to highlands or ""tund yu kawe yi"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   A: Wet bu jege bi am na ap krut bu gëna sew: The passage only mentions thickness variation based on terrain (maria vs. plateaus), not specific to the near side.
*   C: Mën na am ab maria bu neew ci beneen wet wa: The passage talks about potential maria near the poles, not necessarily ""another side"" in general. Also, it only says it *might* exist, not that the crust is definitively thinner there.
*   D: Mën na am ab maria bu neew ci suufu tund yu kawe yi: The passage explicitly states that the crust is *thicker* on plateaus (highlands)."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, fan la krutu weer bi gëna sewee?","The correct answer is **C: Ci suufu tund yu kawe yi**

Here's why:

The text states that the crust is ""gëna dijj ci kaw plateau yi"", which translates to ""thicker on the plateaus"". Plateaus are high, flat areas, essentially highlands or high ground. Therefore, the crust is thickest in areas that are tund yu kawe yi (high ground).
"
"Di sukkëndiku ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop la ñeen ñi gëm?","The correct answer is **C: Dund am na ci yeneen palaanet yi** (Life exists on other planets).

The passage states that some people believe ""dafa am ay mbindeef wala alien yu dëkk ci yeneen planete yi,"" which directly translates to ""there are creatures or aliens that live on other planets."" This is the same as saying life exists on other planets.
"
Lan mooy gën di sew ci li ngay gën di sore diggu naaj gi?,"Correct answer: **C: Gaaz**

Explanation:
The passage states ""Gas bi dafay waññeeku soo leen di sori diggu Naaj wi."" This translates to ""Gas decreases as you move away from the center of the sun."" Therefore, gas becomes less dense as you move away from the sun's center.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban waalu naaj gi la ñu mëna gisee ci kaw suuf?","The correct answer is **C: Fotosfeer bi**.

The text states: ""Benn xaaj bi feete si biti buñuy gis sunuy xool ci naaj wi moom lañuy woowee fotosfeer..."" which translates to ""The part facing outwards that we can see with our eyes is called the photosphere...""
"
Ban ci yii ñu seetlu ñoo dimbali ci di dëggël teori bu Copernic?,"Jéego yi nekk ci Venus mooy tontu bu baax bi. Ngir xam loolu, ñu xool li Q di laaj ak la P wax:

*   **P:** Xët yi nekk ci Venus moo biral njàngatu Copernicus ci ni déele yi dañoo wër Jant bi. (Tolluwaayi Venus dafay biral njankatu Copernicus ci ni déele yi dañoo wër Jant bi.)

Tontu bi mooy **A: Xët yi nekk ci Venus**."
Ban ci bii toop la Galilée seetluwoon ca àtum 1610?,"The correct answer is **B: Xët yi nekk ci Venus** (Phases of Venus). The passage states that Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe whether Venus had phases, similar to the moon.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, fan la dexub Amazon bi di tankee ndox?","The correct answer is **A: Ay dex yu gëna ndaw** (Smaller rivers).

The passage states: ""Dafay boole ndox yu bawoo ci ay juniy dex yu ndaw."" which translates to: ""It merges water from thousands of smaller rivers."" This directly indicates the Amazon River collects its water from smaller rivers.
"
Ban ràññële la ñu joxul Dexu Amazon bi?,"The answer is **C: Moo di dex bu gëna gudd**.

The text states that the Amazon is the *second* longest river, not the longest. The other options are mentioned in the passage as characteristics of the Amazon.
"
Ban rëddu liggéeykat yu ñu lim ci lu ñu bind mooy jëfëndikoo mbooloom Venezuelien bu gëna neew?,Answer: C
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci sektër yii mooy jëfëndikoo Venezuelien yu gëna bare ngir ñu liggéey?","The correct answer is **A: Njariñ (Service)**.

Here's why:

* The text states ""Fukk ak juróom ñett ci téeméer bu waa Wenesyelaa bo jël amu ñu liggéey, té ñu ëpp ñëp ñuuy liggéey ñoŋi ci surnal kom-kom"" which translates to ""Seventeen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and *most of those who are employed work in the service sector*.""

The other options are incorrect based on the information in the passage:

*   **B: Mbay (Agriculture):** The text states ""Juróom ya liggéey ca mbey"" which translates to ""Five percent work in agriculture"".
*   **C: Yewwute gu ndefar (Manufacturing):** The text states ""daa naka ñent ya ñooy liggéey ci wàllu Industri"" which translates to ""Four percent work in Industry"".
*   **D: Diw (Oil):** The text says ""Benn ci témér yo jël ñooy liggéy ci koom koom ngi"" which translates to ""One percent work in this (oil) economy""."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan la fusion di may biddéew yi def?","The correct answer is **A: Di defar ay mbir yu gëna diis**.

The passage states that stars generate light and heat due to the fusion process where hydrogen atoms combine to form heavier elements (""mbir yu gëna diis"").
"
Ban ci yii toop la ap fusion reaktër bu am solo di sàkk?,"Jéggal, ci texte bi mu wax ne biddéew yi mooy génnee leeraay ak tangoor ci seeyalug atoomu ndox yi (wala seeyal).

**B: Biddéew**
"
Lan lmooy defarluwaay simik bu dox?,"The correct answer is **D: Ñaari xarefulwoon hydrogene ak benn xarefulwoon oxygene**.

The text states: ""Ndox mu jaxasoo mi ñaari atomi idorosen aj benn atomu oksisen lañ ko defaree.""  This directly translates to water is made of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. Since ""xarefulwoon"" is used for ""atom"", option D is the correct choice.
"
"Bu ndox sopee ci melokaan, lan mooy dess nu mu meloon?","The correct answer is **A: Tërëlinu molecule**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that the chemical makeup (the molecules) doesn't change when the physical state (solid, liquid, gas) changes.** The passage specifically mentions that a water molecule, whether it's in the form of gas (steam), liquid (water), or solid (ice), is still made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.  Therefore, the arrangement and composition of the molecules remain the same.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Diisaay (Density):** Density changes between states (e.g., ice is less dense than liquid water).
* **C: Taxawaay ci jëm (Physical Appearance):** The physical appearance obviously changes when water changes from liquid to solid or gas.
* **D: Azot likid (Liquid Nitrogen):**  The passage uses liquid nitrogen as an example of phase change not what is happening with water.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop moo nekkulwoon ap jafe jafe ngir fukk ak ñeeteelu réew mi ba ñuy jeema tërël yenn yoon yi?","The passage describes several weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation. Let's analyze each option in relation to the passage:

*   **A: Seetlu mu rëy jogee ci njiitu réew yi (Oversight from a strong leader)** The passage states ""ndax amul woon bénn njiit wala atté kat,"" meaning there was no strong executive leader. This was a problem, not an oversight.
*   **B: Ñàkkum doole ci biir Congres bi (Lack of power within Congress)** The passage mentions ""Congrees gnakk doolé ngir ték ay daan,"" stating Congress lacked power to impose taxes. This *was* a problem, as it made the government weak.
*   **C: Ap amendement miy laaj waawup ñëpp (An amendment requiring unanimous consent)** The passage says ""Artiikël bi dafay laaj lu ñépp nangu ci réew yépp laata ñu leen di mëna jël,"" meaning amendments required unanimous consent from all states. This *was* a problem, making it difficult to change the Articles.
*   **D: Ap jëfkat national bu amul (A national executive being absent)** The passage explicitly states ""ndax amul woon bénn njiit wala atté kat"" which indicates the absence of a national executive. This *was* a problem.

The question asks for what was *NOT* a problem. Options B, C, and D were all stated problems. Option A describes something the states lacked, not something that was causing a problem.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Seetlu mu rëy jogee ci njiitu réew yi**"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban baat mooy wone ci bu baax nekkinu njiit mi njëkk mi ci jamono Xare Revolutionnare bi?","The correct answer is **C: Ñuy teewal réew mi ñàkkoon nañu ap téewaay** (Representatives of the states lacked attendance).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...réew yi jël nañu nguur gu mag ci nimu gëna leeree ni seeni teewalkat dañu dan faral di ñakka teew."" This directly translates to ""the states took great power to the point that their representatives would often lack attendance."" This lack of consistent attendance by state representatives hindered the effectiveness of the central government.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Juuti yi Congres bi ak boroom sañ-sañu réew yi dëgërëloon nañu leen** (The congress's judiciaries and the state's rights were strengthened) - While the passage discusses state power, it says the congress lacked power, contradicting ""strengthened"".
* **B: Amandement yi ci Artikal yi ñungi doon sukkëndiku ci sañ-sañu Congres** (The Amendments of the Articles were based on the authority of the Congress) - The passage discusses the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation, not its amendments.
* **D: Gouvernement central bi amoon na ñaar yu ko ëmb** (The central government had two components) - The passage states the central government was weak because it lacked a chief executive or judiciary. It doesn't imply that it only had two.
"
Naka lañu bindee baat yu nekk ci ganaawu xamle tembte bi?,"The answer is **A: Ci araf yu rëy**

The passage states ""Mbind mi dafa feeñ ci njeextalu wayndaare gi, dañu ko juutal.""  ""Juutal"" in this context implies that the text was written in a noticeable or prominent way, suggesting large lettering. The passage also mentions the large size of the document, further supporting the idea of large lettering.
"
Ban ci yii toop mooy wone siiwaayu Singapour?,"The correct answer is **A: Gàncax mu wert bi ci dëkk bi (The green spaces in the city)**

Here's why:

* The text mentions that before Singapore's independence, people worked to make the country resemble a tropical garden city. This implies that green spaces are a significant and defining aspect of Singapore.
* The other options are not mentioned in the text and are therefore not the correct answer.
"
Lan mooy Vanda Miis Joaquim?,"The correct answer is **B: Ap toor-toor (An orchid)**

The passage states that Vanda Miss Joaquim is a ""njaxasi orchidée"" which means a hybrid orchid.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ngënelu piramid Giga moo dul woon luy yeemi ak nguuru Egyptiens bu bees bi?","The correct answer is **A: Seeniy àt**.

Here's why:

*   **P states:** The passage says that even though the Great Pyramid was from the Old Kingdom, no pyramid exceeded it in length and sophistication of construction. The later Egyptians admired the monument of their predecessors that existed for thousands of years.
*   **Q asks:** Considering the passage, what aspect of the Great Pyramid was NOT a source of amazement for the New Kingdom Egyptians?

While the passage implies admiration for the stone material (B), the size/scale (C), and the construction methods (D), it never mentions *years* as something that the New Kingdom Egyptians explicitly found amazing about it.

Therefore, **A: Seeniy àt (Their years)** is the most accurate answer as it is not mentioned as something the New Kingdom Egyptians admired."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, fan la herbivores yi jogee ndax di toop tow li?","The answer is **C: Toolu bëj saalum yi** (Southern Plains).

Here's why:

* The text states that the herbivores (those that eat grass) move ""ci suufi yi féte sud"" which translates to ""to the lands facing south."" This directly implies they are starting from the lands *north* of their migration path, thus the **Southern Plains** would be where they originate.
"
"Suñu sukkandi ci lu ñu bind, ban bërëp la luy dundee ñax di bawoo suñuy waaja yegg Avril?","The correct answer is **A: Diwaanu Serengeti**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the wildebeest return to the northwest after the rains stop around April. The Serengeti region is described as including Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Maswa Game Reserve (in Tanzania) and Maasai Mara National Reserve (in Kenya). Therefore, as they return to the *northwest*, they would be leaving *from* the Serengeti region.
"
Operation Sealion nekkoon na ap songo ban dëkk?,"The correct answer is **B: Bretaañ**.

The passage states that Germany started preparing to invade England (Angalteer), which is also known as Great Britain or Britain/Bretaañ. Operation Sealion was the name of that planned invasion.
"
Lan la Almaañ woowee song bi ci kaw Bretaañ?,"The correct answer is **B: Operation Sealion**.
"
Lan la ñu bindul ni ap faan bu am solo ci palangu Italie ngir japp ay réewu Afrik?,"D. Yàq baazu Angalé yi

**Reasoning:**

The passage states that Italy needed a base to launch attacks from the Mediterranean Sea into Africa in order to conquer African territories. To achieve this, they needed to ""tàggale bërëb yi ak gaal Angalteer yi ca Isipt"" which means to separate the area from the English ships in Egypt. This implies destroying or neutralizing the British naval base in Egypt, which is why ""Yàq baazu Angalé yi"" (Destroy the English base) is the correct answer.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan la ñu jappeewoon jublukaayu Italie bu njëkk ci xare gi?","The correct answer is **A: Japp réewu Afrik yi**.

The passage states: ""Jubluwaay bu mag bu Itali moo doon dëkku Afrig yi."" which translates to ""The main objective of Italy was to occupy the countries of Africa.""
"
Kan moo samp ay xaritoo ak ñu leen song?,"The correct answer is **B: Vichy Français bi**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vichy bu France mooko doon jiité. Ay wa France la ñu woon yu indi jam ak Alëmaa yi ci atum 1940 té liggéeyoon ak ñoom té xéxuñu ak ñoom.""

This clearly indicates that the Vichy French collaborated with the Germans. Therefore, they were the ones who became allies with them.
"
Ñan ñoo nekkoon lëkkaale yu bokkoon ci Sëfu wayma jaan?,"The correct answer is **A: Americain yi ak Français yu ñu goreel** (Americans and Free French).

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Ci ñaari ayubés dong Americains yi ak soldaru Free French wallu nañu sowwu France té jall ci almañ"" (In two weeks, the Americans and Free French soldiers liberated western France and advanced on the Germans). This clearly indicates that the Americans and Free French were allied and liberating France.
*   The passage states ""Kureelu Mbootayub Xeet yi dug nañu bët-saalumu Faraas, ngelaane ñoŋko don wowe ‘’Sëfu wayma jaan’"" (The Allied Forces entered southern France, in an operation called ""Dragoon Operation"") which confirms that it was the Allied Forces that executed the Dragoon operation.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The Vichy French were collaborators with the Germans, not allies of the Americans.
*   **C:** The Germans were the enemy that the Americans and Free French were fighting against.
*   **D:** The Americans were fighting against the Germans.

"
Yokkute ban teknoloji moo waral ba su-marin yi tambalee tukki ci suufu ndox?,"The correct answer is **D: Radaar**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Laata jamono seen limi sox yi dañoo yeexoon lool Ci ndorteelu xare bi, dañoo tukki jaar ci kaw géeej gi lu bare, wante ba **radar yi dooree di yokku te di gëna xarañ**."" This directly implies that the development of radar technology led to submarines spending more time underwater.
"
"Waxtu bu ñu leen njëkkee jëfëndikoo, su-marin yi amoon nañu ap bërëp gu neew jëmëleko ci lan?","The passage says: ""Laata jamono seen limi sox yi dañoo yeexoon lool"". This translates to ""Before, their speeds were very slow"". This implies their ability to **Tukki** (travel) was limited.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Tukki**.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kan moo jéggi ap sartu diggënte? ","The correct answer is **D: Sovietik yi** (The Soviets).

The passage explicitly states that the Soviet Union violated the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements. Therefore, they are the ones who broke the treaty.
"
Ban ci yii toop la Armé bu Xonk bi mattalulwoon?,"The passage states that the Soviet Union Red Army entered and acted as the Belarussian and Ukrainian fronts. Therefore, the passage doesn't say the Red Army didn't fulfill ""Sàncup ap front Ukrainien"". The passage says the Red Army broke many agreements, thus the Red Army did not ""Jéggi ap sartu diggënte"". The passage discusses the invasion of the eastern territories, thus ""Ap dugg ci diwaanu penku yi"" was fulfilled. There is nothing that shows ""Ap defaraat ci boppu pom bi"" was fulfilled by the Red Army. 

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Ap defaraat ci boppu pom bi**.
"
Lan moo daloon seef ingeniër bu fukkeelu armé Italien bi?,"The correct answer is **C: Angalé yi ñoo ko jàppoon** (The English captured him).

The passage states: ""Ci benn ndarkepp ci penku Bardia, Angale yi jàpp nañu Kilifa Inseñër bu Fukkeelu larme bu Itali, Seneral Lastucc."" (In a raid east of Bardia, the English captured the Chief Engineer of the 10th Italian Army, General Lastucc).
"
Fan la ñu réyeewoon Italo Balbo?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobrouk**.

The text states that Marshal Italo Balbo was killed by friendly fire while landing in Tobruk.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci teknik yii toop moo di faan bu gëna am solo ci waxtu xalaatu Tibetain?","Based on the text provided, the most important technique for Tibetan meditation is **C: Jeema gis yàlla yi (Trying to visualize deities)**.

Here's why:

*   The text emphasizes ""Deity Yoga"" as the core of Tibetan self-visualization.
*   It states that through visualizing deities, purification occurs, chakras are activated, and clarity of mind is created.

While the other techniques are mentioned (A: breathing exercises within Kundalini yoga, B: chanting mantras, D: Yoga postures from Kundalini Yoga), visualizing deities is presented as the *central* practice in the context of Tibetan self-visualization (meditation) as described in the text."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, naka la ñuy taalee chakras yi ci waxtu “diggu” xalaatu Tibetain yi?","The text states: ""Jaaree ko ci xoolub xeeti Yàlla yi kartanu jàllukaay yi di raxas, chakra yi danu leen doxal ak leeralu xel yi nu sàkk leen."" This translates to: ""Through visualization of deities and purification of the energy channels, chakras are activated and enlightened minds are created.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **B: Ci di jeema gis yàlla yi** (By trying to visualize the deities)"
Kan moo jàng ñaareelu wëyu téereb diine bi ca programme ba?,"The correct answer is **D: Jai Shankar Choudhary**.

The text states that Sanju Sharma started the evening, followed by Jai Shankar Choudhary.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kan moo jàng ap wëyub diine ca waxtu mayeb lekk ba?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

The text states that Lakkha Singh performed bhajan songs after the Chhappan Bhog bhajan. It also says that Lakkha Singh showed the Chhappan Bhog bhajai tamit. So, he was the one singing devotional songs during the offering of the food.
"
Lan moo nekkoon ñaareelu performans bu mujj bu ngoon si?,"Li ñaareelu performans bu mujj mooy Dervis yu Turné (C).
"
Ban nasionaalite la Alessandro Safina am?,"The correct answer is **D: Italien**.

The text states that Alessandro Safina is an ""Italian tenor"" (tenooru Itaali bi).
"
"Di sukkëndiku ci lu ñu bind, ban ci baat yii moo dëgguwul?","The correct answer is **B: Nit ñi tejuwoon nañu ci ay tundu Russe**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Lakk-lakk amoon na ca Santa Clara** - This is true. The passage mentions ""faykatu lakk yi"" (firefighters) and a fire incident.
*   **C: Ña nekkoon ca woto wa joxoon nañu leen ndox** - This is true. The passage states ""Jox nañu ndox tukkikat yi"" (The passengers were given water).
*   **D: Jëloon na 60 simili ci lu neew ngir waccee kenn ca woto ba** - This is true. The passage states ""dina jël lumu bonn bénn waxtu ngir genné nit ki njëkk"", a ""waxtu"" translates to ""hour"" and there are 60 minutes in an hour.

*   **B: Nit ñi tejuwoon nañu ci ay tundu Russe** - There is no mention of ""ay tundu Russe"" or ""Russian slides"" in the passage. Therefore, this statement is false and makes it the answer."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kan moo njañse leen lu jëm ci tolluwaayu tanggoor gu neexul gi?","The correct answer is **B: Seefu pompié bi (Seefu faykatu lakk yi)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Njiitu faykatu lakk yi Scott Kouns néena..."" which translates to ""The fire chief Scott Kouns said..."". Therefore, the fire chief is the one providing information about the uncomfortable heat.
"
Fan la kuran paanoon ndax jëfinu Tsunami bi?,"A: Tonga. The passage states ""...wayé kuran amul woon..."" which translates to ""...but there was no electricity..."" in Tonga.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, naka la paanu kurang bi laaleewoon Tonga?","The correct answer is **D: Sañ-sañ yi mënuñuwoon a jot ay mënas yu dëggu** (The authorities were unable to obtain accurate responses).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...kuran amul woon..."" (there was no electricity). This implies that communication and the ability to receive information (including responses) were compromised.
* Option D directly addresses the challenge of authorities being unable to get accurate information due to the power outage.
* The passage doesn't describe **A, B or C.**
"
Kañ la poliis mënoona jëfëndikoo fetelu radaar ngir koronomeetare ngaawte dowalu Jonny Reid?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba mu nekkeewoon di dowal ci 160km ci waxtu**.

The passage states: ""benn yoon rekk bi polis fexee ba natt waxtu Mr Reid mooy bamu wàññi we ba 160km/h"" which translates to ""the only time the police managed to measure Mr. Reid's speed was when he slowed down to 160km/h.""
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lu taxoon mu jafe ngir poliisu Nouvelle-Zélande koronometare gaawteeb Jonny Reid?","The correct answer is **A: Dafa doon dowal ci suufu 160kM ci waxtu (He was driving over 160km per hour)**

The passage states that the police had difficulty using speed radar because of the speed of the Black Beauty (the car). While they were able to clock him once slowing down to 160km/h, the initial difficulty stemmed from the speed itself.
"
Fan la yëngëtu suuf si amoon jëm ci Butte?,"The correct answer is **D: 65 mille bët-gànnaar**.

The passage states: ""Yëngu yëngu suuf si nekkoon na ci [...] lu wara tollok 65 km (40 miles) ci sowwu Butte."" (""The earthquake was located approximately 65 km (40 miles) west of Butte."")

The options are in ""milles"" not ""km,"" so we need to look for the one closest to 40 miles. The closest option is 40 miles, but it's the wrong direction (east instead of west). Option D is the closest mileage *and* mentions the west direction: 65 miles, west of Butte.
"
Lan moo jiboon ca xeex ba ca Abu Ghraib?,"The correct answer is **C: Dooley US yi topatoo kaarange gi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes abuses at Abu Ghraib prison by American soldiers.** The US forces were in charge of security at the prison, therefore they were the ones responsible for the acts described.
* The other options are not directly related to the events described in the passage.
"
Lu waraloon kaso Irak yi siiwoon? ,"The correct answer is **D: Feeñinu mbugël gi jëm ci ñuñu téj** (The revelation of torture of those imprisoned).

The passage states that Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq became famous after images surfaced showing American soldiers torturing an Iraqi prisoner.  Therefore, the fame of the prison was due to the revealed torture.
"
Ban faanu xew la ñu waroon a defee ca Estadu Fattëliku Xare Maui ba?,"The correct answer is **C: Konser**.

The passage states that the event planned for Maui's War Memorial Stadium was a ""band bi fomb xew xew"", which translates to ""band's performance event"" or ""concert event"". Therefore, a concert was planned.
"

Ku def ba ñu bare ñu dëkk Bishkek foog ni ñoo waraloon cacc bi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ñuy ñaxtu (Those who complain)**.

The text says ""Way-dëkk Bishkek yu bari japp nañu ne ñaxtukat yu joge ci bëj-saalum bi ño tax lu way nex def"" which translates to ""Many Bishkek residents believe that the complainers from the south are to blame.""  The complainers are those who are ""ñaxtu"".
"
Kan moo jiiñ ñaxtukat yi nekkoon ci bëj-saalumu sacc gi?,"The text states: ""Way-dëkk Bishkek yu bari japp nañu ne ñaxtukat yu joge ci bëj-saalum bi ño tax lu way nex def."" This translates to ""Many Bishkek residents believe that the rioters from the south are the cause of the vandalism."" Therefore, the answer is A.
"
Kañ la Ring dundee ay njaay yu yokku?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba mu féeñee ca Shark Tank**.

The passage states: ""Siminoff wax na ne njaay yi dañoo yokku gannaaw ba mu feeñee ci 2013 ci benn episodu Shark Tank..."" This directly indicates that sales increased after the Shark Tank appearance.
"
Kañ la Jamie Siminoff tannee tambali Ring?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba mu xamee ni sonëri buntëm dafa jagadiwoon** (When he realized his doorbell was needed).

The text explicitly states that Siminoff started the company because he realized he couldn't hear the doorbell from his garage/workshop.
"
Bepp episoodu jàng xon mayoon na gone yi ay digël ngir lan?,"Jàng Rainbow mayoon na gone yi ay ndigël ngir **D: Ay téere**.

(The text says: ""Ab woone gu nekk doon na joxe tamit ay ndigle ngir téere yi xale yi wara wër bu ñu demee ca bërëb ba téeree yi nekk."" which translates to: ""Each episode also gave instructions for the books that children should look for when they went to the place where the books were."" This indicates that the show provided guidance related to books.)
"
Lan moo am wall ci nu ñu dogee seri yu Jàngup Xon bi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ay finasma yu doyul** (Insufficient funding).

The text explicitly states: ""...jafe-jafey financement ak jàll ci xalaatu porogaraamu njàng jàppale nañu ci jeexal série yi."" This translates to ""funding difficulties and changing educational programming philosophies contributed to ending the series.""  While John Grant's opinion is mentioned, the primary reason cited is financial.

"Sukkëndiku ci ap seef inspektër ngir RSPCA, seetlu yi dañoo wara yem ngir ban ci yii toop?","Based on the text provided, the correct answer is:

**B: Kepp kuy liggéey ak mala yi**

The passage states that, according to the RSPCA inspector, CCTV will send a message to ""nit yooyu di liggéey ak mala yi"" (those working with the animals) that their welfare is paramount. This indicates that the observations are aimed at those working with the animals, not just the locations themselves.

"
"Ngir tuntu ñaxtu bi, ban réew moo jëfeewul ak mandargaalu sartu diggënte ACTA?","The correct answer is **A: Almaañ**.

The passage mentions protests happening in cities across Germany (Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg, Hanover). It does not say that Germany has withdrawn or is not proceeding with ACTA. The other answer options are incorrect:

*   **B: Pologne:** The passage says that Poland is having second thoughts due to the protests and may not ratify the treaty.
*   **C: Ecosse:** Scotland (Ecosse) is mentioned as having protests in Edinburgh and Glasgow, but it's not a country that would ratify the treaty on its own; it's part of the UK.
*   **D: Lituanie:** Lithuania (Lituanie) is mentioned as having protests in Vilnius, but it's not a country that would ratify the treaty on its own; it's part of the UK."

"Ba muy joxe bataaxalam, lan la Steve Jobs waxoon ni Apple moom la doon sàkkaat?","The correct answer is **B: Telefon**.

The passage says, ""Tey Apple dina coppi waat portaabal, tey dañuy bindaat mboor"" which translates to ""Today Apple will reinvent the phone, today we are rewriting history."" Thus, the correct answer is ""Telefon"".

Fan la Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner yegle bëgg bëggamu jongante?,"The correct answer is **C: Ca teatar Argentain bi sori Buenos Aires ci 31 mille**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Mrs. Kirchner announced her intention to run in La Plata, a city located 50 kilometers (approximately 31 miles) from Buenos Aires.
*   The passage also mentions the Argentine Theatre, where she will be launching her campaign.
*   Combining these facts, we know that she announced her intention at the Argentine Theatre, which is near La Plata, 31 miles from Buenos Aires."

"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban baat jëm ci Blake moo dëgguwul?","The correct answer is **B: Dafa nangu soong bi (He admitted the charges)**

Here's why:

* The text says: ""...weddina cong yi te neena li mu doon doye poteau bi mooy aar buteel yi ko ay ndaw doon sànni..."" which translates to ""...he denied the charges and said that what he was doing with the pole was to protect himself from bottles that young people were throwing at him..."" This contradicts option B, making it the incorrect statement about Blake.
"
"Di sukkëndiku ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii moo dalulwoon Blake?","The correct answer is **C: Dañu ko soong ak ap bant** (He was beaten with a pole).

Here's why:

*   **A: àttee nañu ko ni ku wëlbëti njubte (He was judged as guilty)** - The passage states he was found at the scene and is going to prison (""lu mënul woon ñakk la” dafay dem kaso"").
*   **B: Dañu ko jappoon (He was arrested)** - The passage says he was ""presentateur bi ñu fekk ci barab bi"" which implies he was apprehended or taken into custody at the scene.
*   **D: Dañu ko waxoon ni mën na am ñu tej ko kaso (He was told he might be imprisoned)** - The passage states ""lu mënul woon ñakk la” dafay dem kaso"" which means ""it's inevitable he will go to prison.""
*   **C: Dañu ko soong ak ap bant (He was beaten with a pole)** - The passage says he was using the post to protect bottles from being thrown, *not* that he was beaten with it.

Therefore, being beaten with a pole is the only thing that didn't happen to Blake according to the text."
Fan la ñuy dugal xaalis bi U.N jagleel tàngooru jawwu? ,"The correct answer is **C: Kër yu ci dëgg dañoo sanku ci ndox (Houses that have been damaged by floods)**

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""Mën nañu yobbu xaalis bi ci kër yi mbënd mi laal..."" which directly translates to ""The money can be sent to the houses that have been damaged by floods...""
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan la U.N yaakaar a texeel?","The correct answer is **A: Xaalis, jare ko ci seedële teknolosi** (Money, through technology sharing).

The passage states the U.N. hopes to allocate funds to help vulnerable countries address climate change. This implies they are hoping to make *money* available. The sharing of *technology* is listed as one component of the Bali program, so it is also involved in the U.N's hopes.
"
Ban ci yii toop la Albert Muchanga limulwoon ni lenn lu soxlawoon ñu nangu ko?,"The correct answer is **C: Ay sartu cosaan** (Rules of origin).

The passage states that Muchanga mentioned ""deggoo wa gñu ci nimu sàrtu cosaan bi ak njëgi dêkkuwaay yi"" (agreement on rules of origin and tariff concessions) as something still needing to be agreed upon. Therefore, rules of origin are what Muchanga highlighted as needing further agreement.
"

The text says: ""deggoo wa gñu ci nimu sàrtu cosaan bi ak njëgi dêkkuwaay yi, waaye kaadar biñu am doyna ngir ñu tambalee jaay 1 fan ci Sulet 2020"" which translates to ""the agreement on rules of origin and tariff concessions, but the framework they have is enough to start trading on July 1, 2020.""  This directly supports option B.

"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan la Atlanta Journal-Constitution jiiñ ñuy topatoo njàng mi?","The correct answer is **C: Di baña jëf ci jafe jafe yu ñu seetlu te ñun nekk ci biir** (Failing to address internal problems that were observed).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Konstitisiyon wu Surnaalu Atlanta buñu siiwal na ab néttali buy wone ay jafe-jafe li tukkee ci test yi...te waxjafe-jafe biir yu daara ja wante waxul ci li nu gis."" (The Atlanta Journal-Constitution published a report showing problems stemming from testing...and internal school problems were mentioned but not addressed). This means the newspaper report highlighted problems but *didn't* show any action being taken to solve them. Therefore, the school system was failing to address internal problems."
"Di sukkëndiku ci xebaar bu ñu joxe ci lu ñu wax, lan la ñu waxulwoon ca Atlanta Journal-Constitution bi?","Ci sukkandiku ci xebaar bi, Konstitisiyon wu Surnaalu Atlanta (Atlanta Journal-Constitution) du wax luy firndeel ni test yi dañu leen sopiwoon.

"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban xebaar la ñu xam ni moo toop bombardement bi?","The correct answer is **A: Limu gaañu gaañu yi yëpp** (The total number of casualties).

The passage states:

*   ""limu ñi faatu dem na ba juróom ñett"" (the number of deaths has risen to eight)
*   ""ay nettali yu wóor firndeel nañu ni lu toll ci 30 ñoo ci gaañu"" (reliable reports confirm that about 30 people were injured)

This information directly addresses the number of casualties (both dead and injured), making option A the most accurate answer to the question of what news followed the bombing.
"
"Ba mu bokkee ci Manchester City ci 2017, ñaata mats la Jesus suwéwoon?","Let's analyze the passage:

*   The passage states that Jesus joined Manchester City in 2017.
*   It also says he has participated in 53 matches for the club and scored 24 goals.

The question asks how many goals Jesus had *when* he joined, before his 2017 games. The text states his goal count after he has already had his 53 games for the club. We are looking for the total goals *after* he already was apart of the club.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **A: 24**

The passage provides the information that Jesus scored 24 goals for Manchester City since joining in 2017. The question asks the total number of goals Jesus scored for the team, and this is the total given by the passage."
Ban klub la Jesus jote £27 miliongu njëg ci bokk kesse?,"The correct answer is **B: Manchester City**.

"
Ban baat jëm ci inwité yi ci obers bi moo dëgguwul?,"The correct answer is **C: Inwite yi ñungi fa woon ngir ngoonug hajj.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the pilgrims were there ""banu nee suba la aj gi"" which translates to ""the day before the Hajj"". Thus, they were there *before* the Hajj started, not *during* it.
*   The other options are supported by the text:
    *   A: ""Tabax gi dalaloon nanu ci ay limu ajkat yu ñëwoon di xool ci dëkk bu tedd bi ci banu nee suba la aj gi"" indicates they were pilgrims going to Mecca.
    *   B: They were not local because ""Ganu kër gi nékkonañu lu ci ëpp ñu dëkk ci United Arab Emirates"" meaning guests were mostly from UAE
    *   D: States that they come from the holy city."

"Di sukkëndiku ci lu ñu bind, ban xebaar jëm ci kalash bi moo dul lu woorul?","The question asks which piece of information about the debris is NOT explicitly stated in the passage. Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: Ni kalash bi tool (The weight of the debris):** The passage states the debris weighs 1,000 pounds. So, its weight IS mentioned.

*   **B: Bërëpu kalash bi (The altitude of the debris):** The passage says the debris is traveling at 491 miles above the Earth. So, its altitude IS mentioned.

*   **C: Jëfi kalash bi ci kaw suuf si (The effects of the debris on the surface):** The passage mentions that scientists are trying to figure out the effects of the explosion and how it will impact the Earth. This suggests that while they are looking into the effects, the exact effects are not explicitly stated, which would be the closest thing to the answer.

*   **D: Bërëpu toj toj yi (The location of the debris):** The passage says the U.S. Bank of Decision is tracking the debris. This implies they know (or are trying to know) the location.

Therefore, the answer is **C: Jëfi kalash bi ci kaw suuf si (The effects of the debris on the surface).** While the potential effects are mentioned as something being investigated, the actual effects are not described in the passage."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan moo soxla ñu maas ko ba tey jëm ci kalash bi?","The correct answer is **A: Kan mooy topatoo di wër fu toj toj yi nekk**

The passage states: ""Bàankaasu ndogal bu Amerig bu biro bu Amerig buy yor wàllu Aar karaange gi dafay top tojjit yi.""  This translates to: ""The American bureau of national security is following the debris.""  Therefore, finding out who is tracking the debris is a key piece of information related to the passage.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban palaas la Batten benn yoon teye ci listu Americain yu gëna am alal?","The correct answer is **C: 190**.

The passage states that Batten ""nekkoon kuy jàppale bu baax Daara joojule,"" and ""Daara joojule"" refers to ""Daara ju kawe bu Virgini,"" which translates to ""Université bu Virginie"". Therefore, Batten gave a lot of donations to the University of Virginia.

The passage states that Miller said, ""...Dama doon waajlu moo tax dégguma bu baax limu doon wax,"" which translates to ""...I was preparing myself, that's why I didn't hear well what he was saying."" This directly indicates that Miller was not listening attentively because he was preparing himself.

This translates to: ""They did not excel in their first match against their countrymen in the south, but in the rest of the matches, the South African team worked hard.""

* **This implies:** Their performance at the *beginning* of the tournament (the first match) was *not* perfect or ""set"".

Here's why:

*   The passage states Hu was encouraging developing nations ""to bypass the old route of destruction and jump over to the path of sustainable development"". ""Route of destruction"" refers to the old route of polusion.

The scientists working on the program were expecting to see these small particles as part of their investigation into the Sagittaire galaxy.
"
Ban ci mbir yii toop la sientifik yi doon xool?,"The correct answer is **D: Danku Sagittaire bi ak Yoonu meew mi**

The passage explicitly states that the program was written to explore the interaction between the Sagittarius galaxy and the Milky Way (Yoonu meew mi). The scientists were looking at how the Milky Way influences the Sagittarius galaxy, similar to how the moon influences the tides on Earth.
"
"Buñu sukkandikoo ci mbind mii, lan la konserwatër dul ŋàññ?","The correct answer is **A: Dépensu ndimbël**.

Here's why:

The passage states that conservatives *criticize* (dupe nanu ko ci ay tooñ) the spending (dépensë yi) on aid (ndimbal) and reconstruction after Hurricane Katrina, calling it ""Bush's plan for New Orleans"". Therefore, what they are *criticizing* is the spending on aid (dépensu ndimbël).  The passage doesn't say they criticize the lack of rebuilding efforts or whom the contracts are going to.
"
Kan mooy ngaññ kontrawu tabaxaat bi ngir liggéeyu ndimbël yi ndax ouragan Katrina?,"According to the passage, the conservatives were accused of ""Bush's scheme for New Orleans"" concerning the expenses related to aid and reconstruction after Hurricane Katrina. The liberals criticized the efforts to rebuild because they aimed to honor deals made by people new to Washington.

So, the question asks who criticized the reconstruction contracts related to aid work after Hurricane Katrina. The passage states that liberals criticized the reconstruction efforts because they aimed to honor deals made by people new to Washington.

Therefore, the answer is **B: Libero yi** (Liberals).
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, fan la lamp yu Stardust véso spasio yi di njëkka féññ?","The correct answer is **B: Bët-gànnaaru Californie**.

The text states: ""Dina dem ci peggu géej gi ci bët gannaaru Kaliforni te dina leeral asamaan ci ca kaliforni jaare ko ci Oregon bi ci digg bi te wey ci Nevada ak Idaaho ak ciUtah"". This means the capsule will first appear over the southern coast of California.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, véso spasial bi dina samp ap rëkoor ngir yan ci yii toop?","The correct answer is **C: Delusiwaat ci kaw Suuf ci bu gëna gaaw** (Returning to Earth the fastest).

The text explicitly states: ""Stardust dina amal benn rekoor gaaw ngir nékk roppalaan bi gëna gaaw ngir ñibbisi ci suuf"" which translates to ""Stardust will set a speed record for being the fastest spacecraft to return to Earth.""
"
Naka la Dr Malar Balasubramanian bokkee ak Saroja Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **C: Yaay**.

The passage states that they found **Saroja Balasubraamanian, 53**, and also says that **Dr. Malar Balasubramanian, 29 at**, was found earlier. Given the age difference, Saroja is likely the mother of Dr. Malar Balasubramanian."
Fan la ñu giseewoon yaramu Sara Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **C: Ci ap kapowu woto**.

The passage states: ""Yobbu na liggéeykat yi ci Oldsmobile Intrigue bu ñuul bi nekkoon ci 500 metar. Foofu, ñoom gis nanu fa neewuu Saroja Balasubraamanian, 53, nu muur ko ak sër bu takk deret."" This translates to: ""She led the workers to the black Oldsmobile Intrigue located 500 meters away. There, they found the body of Saroja Balasubraamanian, 53, covered in a blood-soaked sheet."" Therefore, the body was found in a car trunk (kapowu woto).
"
Lan la eBay jëndoon?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

The passage states that eBay wants to bring increase and difference to its work because it can have the Skype's power in big countries like China, Eastern Europe and Brazil. Therefore, it implies eBay is looking to emulate Skype's success.
"
Lan la eBay bëgg a jot ak njënd mi?,"Answer: **B: Law ci yeneeni dëkk**

Explanation:

The text states eBay bought someone with the hope of ""bringing increase and difference to its work"" and ""being able to have the strength Skype has in big countries like China, Eastern Europe and Brazil."" This strongly implies the goal is to **expand into other countries** (law ci yeneeni dëkk). The other options are possible secondary benefits, but not the primary driver mentioned in the text.

Ban ci yii toop moo tax ba ñuñu tej kaso delu ganaaw ci xeex mi?,"The correct answer is **B: Gas lakrimosén**.

The passage states that after the prisoners refused to return to their cells, police used tear gas (""gaas lakirimosen"") to subdue them and enter the yard. This action directly led to the end of the standoff.
"
"Ci xalaatu Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ci lan la réewub Iran gorelee boppam?","D: Ap dependaans ci petrol
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kan moo nanguwoon mbir yu doom yu ñu doom koom koomu Iran indi?","The correct answer is **A: Surs Señoor**.

The text states: ""Addu yi, yuñu teg ci saasi ci tele bi, **ñoo nekkoon jamono ji nga xamantane ñi bawoo Iran dañoo nangu woon ni daan yi amoon nañ ci njariñ.**"" This translates to: ""The sanctions, which were televised, **were during the period when those from Iran acknowledged that the sanctions had an impact.**""

Therefore, ""Surs Señoor"" (which likely refers to the sanctioners) acknowledged the impact of the sanctions.

"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ci lan la Allen depense xaalisam gu takku?","The correct answer is **B: Gëstu géej gi** (Exploring the sea).

The text states that Allen invested a significant amount of his wealth in **touki guedj bi** (sea exploration) and started searching for the Musashi.  While the ROV (C) and cartography (D) are tools used in the exploration, and finding the Musashi (A) is the *goal* of the exploration, the overall *activity* he spends money on is exploring the sea.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop ñoo yoobu ci ay kondision yu asardës ci biir ak ci lu wër garab gi?","The correct answer is **A: Kombustible bu uraniom**, **B: Cesium radioactif** and **D: Iode**.

Here's why:

*   The report explicitly states that radioactive cesium and iodine were detected at the factory.
*   The report also mentions the risk of uranium containers breaking or leaking.
*   While the white dust is mentioned, the report doesn't directly link it to a hazardous condition. Therefore, it is not a component that has caused the adverse effect that may happen due to a possible leakage."
Ban ci yii toop moo nekkul benn ci xelalu kaaraange yu ñu xelal ñu dëkk ci bërëp bi di toop xew xew gi ca garab ga?,"Answer A: Moytu leen di jëfëndikoo ay unité kilimatisër (Avoid using air conditioning units)

Explanation:

The passage states that people should stay indoors, use their air conditioners, and avoid drinking tap water. It also mentions the risk of the uranium containers breaking or leaking.

*   Staying indoors (B) is a precaution mentioned in the passage.
*   Avoiding tap water (D) is also a precaution mentioned.
*   The passage refers to *white dust* (saxaar gu weer) coming from the factory. While the origin of the dust from the factory is likely the result of some kind of contaminant from the damaged containers, the passage *does not* mention avoiding white sugar(s).

Therefore, using air conditioning units (A) is, according to the passage, *not* an avoidance tactic. You were supposed to utilize air conditioning. So it is the choice that is *not* a recommended precaution for residents near the factory."
"Jëm ci lu Dr Moll wax, lan la ñu wara gëna seetlu jëm ci XDR-TB?","The correct answer is **A: Variant bi di ap kontra ci biir opitaal bi**.

Here's why:

*   Dr. Moll's statement focuses on the fact that the XDR-TB strain is spreading *within hospitals* (lopitaal bi). He suggests transmission is occurring within the healthcare environment. This is a key concern.
*   Option B: The information from the passage says that XDR-TB is *resistant* to drugs (""garab (TB-XDR) mënalul dara"").
*   Option C: This information is factual from the passage, but the focus of the passage is about the virus' spread within hospitals, not how many people the variant can transmit.
*   Option D: Toowu réyam gu kawe = High mortality rate. This option is an important consideration regarding XDR-TB, but not the primary point of concern raised by Dr. Moll in the passage.

Therefore, the most important thing to consider based on Dr. Moll's statements is the spread of the XDR-TB variant *within hospitals*."
Ñaata pasien yu am variant bu bees bi la ñu dëggëloon ni ay liggéeykatu paj mi la ñu?,"The answer is **B: 2**.

The text states: ""Yenn malaat yi mën nañu jëlee wiris bi ci lopitaal bi, ci xalaatu Dr. Moll xalaat, te gën gaa neew ñaar yi ci lopitaal bi lañu daan liggéeyee."" This directly indicates that at least two of the cases were believed to be healthcare workers.
"
Ban faanu teknolosi la sisteemu NextGen di jëfëndikoo?,"The correct answer is **A: Teknolosi bu sukkëndiku ci satelit**

The passage explicitly states that NextGen uses ""satelit bu xarale"" (satellite technology). While the other options might be related to the overall goals or benefits of NextGen, they are not the primary technology it utilizes. Precision (B) is a characteristic, not the core technology. C is partially correct (radar is used), but the satellite aspect is more emphasized. D is the opposite of what NextGen aims to do.
"
Naka la NextGen di jëriñee direkt kontrolëru trafik aerien yi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ay yoonu naaw yu gëna gaat** (Shorter flight paths).

The passage states that NextGen will ""may fafalndaaw yi daw yoon yu bariwul"" (allow planes to fly more direct routes). Direct routes are shorter flight paths.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ci lan la taariixkat yi ngaññul FBI bi ci lu ñu waroon na jublu?","The correct answer is **C: Jublu bu baax ci kaa wu pornografi**

The text states that historians criticize the FBI for shifting resources from tackling serious crimes, like terrorism, to easier cases, such as stolen car. Additionally, the text mentions the 2005 memo advocating that the FBI should assign 10 employees specifically to focus on adult pornography. This directly addresses a criticism of the FBI's resource allocation towards pornography instead of other issues.
"
Lan la initiativ obsén forsé FBI def ko?,"The correct answer is **D: Ay asen yu soobu ci kaa wu pornografi** (Focus on cases involving child pornography).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""leeral ni FBI dafa wara tanë 10 ci liggéey katam ngir nu jublu ci wàllu pornoo mag"" which translates to ""specifying that the FBI should select 10 of its staff to focus on child pornography"".

Kan la Brzezinsku may ndimbël ca diirub Revolution Iranienne ba?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter**.

The text states that Brzezinski was the NSA during the Iranian Revolution in 1979, and that he served as NSA from 1977 to 1981 under President Carter.
"
Kan moo amoon palaasu Digëlkat ci walum kaaraange ba ca àtum 1977?,"The correct answer is **A: Brzezinski**.

The passage states: ""niki liggéey ne Joxekatu Xalaat ci Karaange Biir Réew mi (NSA) dalee ko ci 1977 ba 1981,wutu Henry Kissinger.""  This clearly indicates that Brzezinski took over as NSA in 1977.
"
Ban ci yii toop moo dul wone ci bu baax karieru Bobek ak Partizan Belgrade?,"The correct answer is **A: Dafa duggël lu roomb 468 bu ba mu doon suweel ekip bi**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states Bobek scored 403 goals for Partizan Belgrade, not over 468.** The other options are true, based on the passage."
Ban baat jëm ci taariixu Bobek ak Partizan Belgrade mooy dëgg?,"The correct answer is **A: Dafa tambalee suweel Partizan ci àtum 1945**.

The passage states: ""Fekki na leen ci atum 1945 te desna ci ba atum 1958."" (He joined them in 1945 and stayed until 1958). This directly translates to him starting to play for Partizan in 1945.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban melokaan mooy wuuteel Hesperonychus ak Velociraptor?","The correct answer is **B: Dafa am ñaareelu wee bu gëna gudd**.

The passage states that Hesperonychus is named ""western claw"" because of its enlarged second toe claw. While other features are mentioned that it shares with Velociraptor (walking on two legs, potentially being feathered and warm-blooded), the enlarged claw is presented as a defining characteristic that explains its name.
"
Lu “Hesperonychus” di fiirndeel jogee na cii melokaanu jëmu xeet yi?,"The correct answer is **A: Wee bi(yi)**.

The text states that ""Hesperonychus"" means ""western claw"" due to its large second claw. Therefore, the name refers to a characteristic of the claw.
"
Ban ci baat yii toop jëm ci fit fetal yi mooy dëgg?,"The correct answer is **D: Fiitu fetal bi amee na ca Buffalo**

Here's why:

* The passage states the couple got married in Texas and then came to Buffalo to celebrate their anniversary with friends and family. It also clearly states that the shooting occurred in Buffalo. The other choices are false based on the information given.
"
Ban ci yii baat jëm ci li xew fu fit fetal bi amee ndax dëgg la?,"The correct answer is **A: Amoon na ca ap feetu aniverseer ca Buffalo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the couple came to Buffalo to celebrate their anniversary with friends and family. This directly supports option A.
*   The passage does not state that the party was well known, so option B is incorrect
*   The passage stated that they were married in Texas, so option C is incorrect.
*   The passage doesn't explicitly state it was a couple's retreat; it was an anniversary celebration, making option D incorrect.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan la liggéeykat yi doon xalaat jëm ci Luno?","The correct answer is **C: Karburan buy tuuru (Fuel leakage)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states ""Luno bi amonna 120-160 cubic metres bu fuel bu bitim réw bu pane téy ngélaw bu baax té wamé yi indi ko ci ndoxmi"" which translates to ""The Luno had 120-160 cubic meters of fuel that leaked and the wind and waves brought it into the water."" This clearly indicates a fuel leak.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: Ñakkup kargoowu engaré (Lack of fertilizer cargo):** The text mentions the ship normally carries fertilizer but says they were afraid of a spill, not a lack of cargo.
*   **B: Wag yi ak ngelaw yu bare (Waves and strong winds):** While the waves and winds are mentioned, they are described as contributing to the spread of the fuel, not the main concern of the workers.
*   **D: Ay gaañu gaañu ci ñu bokk ci mbooloom liggeykat yi (Injuries among the workers):** The text states only one person died, the focus isn't on multiple injuries within the workforce."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci baat yii toop jëm ci paanu Luno moo dul dëgg?","Let's analyze each statement based on the provided text (P):

*   **A: Paan bi xew na balaa muy jël kargéson bi.**  The text says the boat was *going* to pick up fertilizer.  This implies it hadn't picked it up yet when the accident occurred. Therefore, this statement is **true**.

*   **B: Gaal gi amoon na 100 meetaru karburan ci biir ca waxtu paan bi.** The text states the boat was 100 meters long (""Gaalu 100 mètres...""). It does *not* say it had 100 meters of fuel on board. Therefore, this statement is **false**.

*   **C: Ci biir fukk ak ñaari membar yi, kenn moo ci gaañu.** The text says that many people were rescued, and only one person died (""Elikopteer bi wàllu na ñu bari ñu nekkoon ci gaal gi, kenn ci ñoom kese la ci bakkanam toj""). The exact number of people on board is not mentioned (only that ""many"" were rescued), but the fact that only one person died means the number of people on the ship was at least two. Therefore, this statement is **true**.

*   **D: Puusoon nañu gaal gi ci dig bi.** The first sentence of P mentions that the ship leaked 120-160 cubic meters of fuel due to being in bad weather conditions. Therefore, this statement is **true**.

Therefore, the only statement that is not true based on the text is **B**.
"
Ci ban xarnu la Algerie amee tembam?,"The correct answer is **C: 1960**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Jeefi Vautier returned to ""Alseri mi moom boppam"" (independent Algeria) in the 1960s. This implies that Algeria became independent *before* the 1960s.
"
Fan la ay xoolukaayu television taakulwoon ngir xewu déj wi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ci biir Room yëpp** (In all of Rome).

The text states: ""Ay Ekarang telewisiyong yu mag yu bare la nu teg ci bërëb y wute ci Rome ngir bàyyi nit ñi nu xool xew xew bi."" This translates to ""Many large television screens were placed in different places in Rome to allow people to watch the event.""
"
Fan la ñu ameewoon xewu déj wi?,"The passage states that the actual event (""dëjj bi"") took place at St. Peter's Square (""St. Peter’s Square""). While the event was also shown in other places in Rome and other countries, the *location* of the event itself was St. Peter's Square.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Ci palaasu St Pierre**
"
"Toop eksplosision bi, kan la ñu doon faj ndax ay gaañu gaañu yu meti?","The correct answer is **B: Kenn**.

The passage states that no one sustained serious injuries (""Guisuñu ñu am ay gaañu - gaañu yu tarr""). While five people were treated for anxiety, that's not the same as being treated for serious injuries.
"

"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ñaata nit ño dee ci xeex bi?","The correct answer is **B: 2**

The text states that Nicolas Alden and Zachary Cuddeback died.
"

This translates to something like ""Schneider testified via a video link from a burn unit in his home town.""

The question is: ""Who suffered burns for a while during the fight?"" Based on the provided text, Schneider is the one who suffered burns, as indicated by being in a burn unit (""dallu bu tàkk der"").

Therefore, the correct answer is:

C: Schneider
"
Ban ci taagat yaraam yii toop la ñu taanulwoon ci programu Olympik bi?,"The correct answer is **A: Squash**.

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Ay tàggati yarami squash, karate ak patin jéem nañu duggu ci kaw porogaraamu Olympic"". This means squash, karate, and roller sports *attempted* to be included, implying they were not yet part of the program.
*   The text says rugby and golf were chosen.
* Baseball was not chosen, but it is not listed as a candidate in the question so squash is the correct option."
Ban ci taagat yaram yii toop la komite international bu Olympik bi wotewoon ngir boole leen ci së yi?,"The correct answer is **C: Mbooloom Rugby**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Rugby, Rawatina mboolo rugby, ak golf tànnoon nanu leen ci juróomi yneen tàggat yaram yu nu jàppon ngir ñu bkk ci jongante bi."" This translates to: ""Rugby, especially rugby sevens, and golf were chosen amongst five other sports considered for inclusion in the games.""

While baseball and softball were mentioned, they were described as having been voted on for the 2005 Olympics, implying a separate and past event. Thus, they are not part of the current vote being discussed in the passage.
"
Arthur Guinness luwé na bu njëkk St James Gate Breweryngir ñaata àt?,"The correct answer is **D: 9000**

The passage states that Arthur Guinness leased St James' Gate Brewery for 9,000 years.
"
Lu tool ci ñaata milyaaru dollars la Guinness di duggël àt bu nekk?,"The passage states ""Guinness magg na doon ab liggéeyukaay bu mag buy jur 10 miliyaari oro (US$14,7 miliyaar) at mu nekk"". This translates to ""Guinness has grown into a large enterprise generating 10 billion euros (US$14.7 billion) annually.""

We are asked to find the amount in *dollars*. The passage says US$14.7 billion.

Out of the options provided, the closest is **C: 14**. (Rounding 14.7 down)
"
Ci ñaata réew ci Union Européenne bi la ñu raññee doomu jangoro ji H5N1?,"The correct answer is **C: Juroom ñaar** (Seven).

The passage lists the following EU countries with H5N1 cases: Ótriis, Almaañ, Esloweeni, Bulgaari, Girees, Itaali, and now Farans. That's seven.
"
Fan la ñu raññeewoon kaa bu gëna bees ci doomu jangoro ji H5N1?,"The correct answer is **A: France**.

The passage states ""...firndéel nañ ni dafa wàll kanaara bu faatu, buñu gisoon Altine, ci marshland ci wetu Lyon ci penku Farans."" which means the dead swan infected with H5N1 was found near Lyon, France.
"
Kañ moo nekkoon àt bu mujj bu Haiti dajeewoon ak feebar bi balaa wal bu ñuy sàmm jamm indi?,"The correct answer is **A: àtum 1800 bi**.

The passage states: ""Lu jiitu ñëwuk soldaar yi, Haiti amul woon ay jafejafe ci fébar bi daléko ci ati 1800 yi.""  This means before the peacekeepers arrived, Haiti hadn't had cholera issues since the 1800s.
"

Lan la nguurup Irland di waaja def?,"The correct answer is **C: Yombal yoon yi jëm ci bayyi doroog yi san kondision** (Ease laws regarding drug use without conditions).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the Irish government is reacting to a recommendation to reform drug policy.
*   The government spokesperson emphasizes the importance of public health and the need to deal with the drug issue urgently.
*   The Minister of Health supports the legalization of drug use and wants to combat illegal drug trading and drug related crimes
*   Therefore, the Irish government is likely to ease laws relating to drug use, and not to penalize nor make them stricter."
Lan moo legaaloon ci benn diir ci réewub Irland?,"Based on the provided text, none of the options (A: Sacc, B: Frod, C: Agrese, D: Doroog yi) are directly mentioned as being legalized in Ireland for a period of time. The text focuses on the decriminalization of abortion.

Therefore, the correct answer is none of the options provided.
"
Lan la ku ñu foog ni moo tooñ def bañu koy laaj?,"The correct answer is **C: Vandalism**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a crime involving the modification of a sign or symbol (the ""O"" changed to a lowercase ""e"").** This falls under the category of vandalism, which involves damaging or defacing property.
* **The passage specifically mentions that nothing was stolen (sacci) or destroyed.**
* **The passage mentions that the person entered a property.**
"
"Ba muy sopi nataal bi, lan la suspé bi deful?","The correct answer is **C: Yàkk ko ci jëm** (Damage it directly).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Tablo bi ci boppam yàquwul woon"" which means ""The painting itself was not damaged.""

The other options are things the passage says the suspect DID do:

*   A:  ""ngir jël """"O"""" soppi ko muy """"e"""" bu ndaw."" (to change one of the letters)
*   B: ""ak ay màndarga jàmm"" (with peace symbols)
*   D: ""ay bâche yu ñuul lañu jëfandikoo ngir taaral ko"" (used black tarps to decorate/alter it)"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop la ñu daanulwoon tutër Angalé bi Karno?","The correct answer is **C: Di imprimé ay publicité yu ñu bayyiwul** (Printing unauthorized advertisements).

The text states that Njang mu Bees mi (The New School) accused him of ""limu empimé ay siiwal yu bari ci ay kaar te joxu ñu leen otorisasiyoŋ"" which translates to printing many advertisements on cards without authorization. This directly corresponds to option C.

The other options are mentioned in the text but not specifically as something he was formally accused of *related to the English teacher*:

*   **A: Infraksion droit dotër (Copyright infringement)**: While he is accused of writing ""mënefu ndoxaan ci ay bind"" (obscene things in his writings), this isn't explicitly described as a copyright infringement, nor related to the English teacher's case.
*   **B: Di génne ak ap ndongo daara (Having an affair with a student)**: The text says he was ""melon ni xaritu ndongo yi kese"" (like a friend of the students), but doesn't explicitly accuse him of an affair.
*   **D: Di jëfëndikoo ay kàllaama yu bon ci biir kalaas (Using foul language in class)**: While he is accused of using words that parents found disrespectful, it is not formally something he was accused of *related to the English teacher's case*."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kan la Rolando Mendoza japulwoon ni ap otaas?","The correct answer is **A: Ay tourist**.

The text states ""Rolando Mendoza tire rafaalu na M16 am ci kaw turist yi"" which means ""Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists"". It also mentions ""amna otage yu bari yuñ jota wallu"" which translates to ""there were many hostages that were taken"". This indicates that the tourists were held hostage.
"
"Di sukkëndiku ci lu ñu bind, ban otaas la ñu waxulwoon ni dañu leen a teela yeewi?","The correct answer is **A: Tourist yi**.

The passage states: ""Juróom-benni ci ñuy jàppoon, am ay xale ak ay mag, tay lañu leen bàyyi ci suba teel, ñoom ak photographe yu waa philippins."" This means 7 hostages, including children, elders, and the Filipino photographer were released early in the morning. It doesn't mention the tourists being released early.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kan mooy dajale ay siñaatuur ngir dimbëli legaalisé seyu ñu bokk awra ci Brazil?","The correct answer is **A: Ñaxtukat yi** (Xeexkat yi).

The passage states: ""Xeexkat yakaar nagnu dajalé ben million ak niari temer mil ci ay siniatir ngir woné ko ci National Congress bu Nowembar."" ""Xeexkat"" translates to ""Activists"" or ""Advocates"", who are trying to gather signatures. The question refers to people supporting legalisation of same-sex marriage as ""dajale ay siñaatuur ngir dimbëli legaalisé seyu ñu bokk awra ci Brazil"" (gathering signatures to support legalising same-sex marriage in Brazil). Thus, the answer is the activists.
"
Kan la ñaxtukat yi di jox petision bi?,"The correct answer is **C: Congres National bu Brézil**.

The passage states: ""Xeexkat yakaar nagnu dajalé ben million ak niari temer mil ci ay siniatir ngir woné ko ci **National Congress bu Nowembar**."" This directly indicates that the petition will be presented to the National Congress.
"
"Jëm ci kontu Armand Versace, lan moo xew ci saas yi balaa mbooloo mi tambalee reasiir ci kilimaa bi?","The correct answer is **C: Amoon na ay ngelaw yu bare** (There were strong winds).

The passage states: ""Juróomi simili ci wonin bi ab ngélaw di tambalee ngélaw, lu jéege benn simili ci kanam, ngélaw li mu ngi àgg 70km/h...""  This clearly indicates strong winds before the chaos and the rain started.
"
"Jëm ci Versace, kañ la ngelaw yu gëna am doole tambale?","The correct answer is **A: Simili yu neew apare bu afisaas bi tambalee**.

The text states that the wind started ""ci wonin bi ab ngélaw di tambalee ngélaw, lu jéege benn simili ci kanam"". This translates to ""when the wind started to blow, almost a few minutes ahead."" Therefore, the wind started shortly before the strong wind appeared, which is best represented by option A.
"
"Balaa Fred, ñaata taw yu magg la ñu bind yu am ci penku wu 35°W?","The correct answer is **C: Ñaar**.

The passage states that Fred is the ""ñatteelu ouragan bu mag buñ xam ci penku 35° Sowwu"" which translates to ""the third major hurricane known east of 35° West"". This means there were two major hurricanes before Fred in that region.
"
"Ba Fred nekkoon ci wetu duni Cap Vert, ci ban yoon la jubluwoon?","The text says ""di dém ci beet gannaar ak sow bi"" which translates to ""going towards beet gannaar and sow bi"".

Therefore, the answer is **D: Bët-gannaru sowu** (Northwest)
"
Ban ci yii toop moo gëna am wites ay naatangoom yu ko jiitu?,"The answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The text explicitly states that 802.11n is backward compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g. Backward compatibility means it can work with older standards, making it the one with the most compatibility with its predecessors.
"
Lan moo am njariñ ngir 802.11n ngir nekk retrokompatibal ak 802.11b?,"The correct answer is **D: Radio dubbal** (Dual radio).

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Normu 802.11n muy dox ci ñaari ferekans yi 2.4Ghz ak 5.0Ghz. Li dinako nangul déllu ginnaw andak 802.11a, 802.11b ak 802.11g, donté bërëb bi am na ñaari rajo.""

    *This part translates to ""The 802.11n standard operates on two frequencies, 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz. This allows it to be backward compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g, even if the area has two radios.""*

*   Having two radios (operating on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) is what allows 802.11n to maintain compatibility with older standards like 802.11b (which operates on 2.4 GHz).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wites yu gëna gaaw (Faster speeds):** While 802.11n is faster, that's a consequence, not the direct reason for backwards compatibility.
*   **B: Kàttanu 802.11b ngir jëf ci 5.0Ghz (802.11b ability to work on 5.0Ghz):** 802.11b doesn't work on 5.0Ghz. It's an older standard that uses 2.4 GHz.
*   **C: Ap wàññi wu 600Mbit/s (A decrease of 600Mbit/s):** 600 Mbit/s is the *maximum* speed of 802.11n, not a decrease.

"
Ñaata xew xew la ku am medaayu wurus bi ci féey ca sëwu Commonwealth ya bokkoon?,"The correct answer is **A: Juroom**

Here's why:

The text states the person participated in ""100m ak 200 feey bi amul luñuy tere ak ñatti relé"", which translates to:

*   100m freestyle
*   200m freestyle
*   Three relay races

Adding those together (1 + 1 + 3 = 5) gives us a total of 5 events."
Lu tax ku am medaayu dooru Olympik ba daanul woon jël garab ngir metitam?,"Ci maanaa bi, ñun xam nan ne mënul woon a jël garab yi nga soxla ngir mëna dëkku metitam ndax dañoo yàq Po yi (Olympic Committee). Loolu moo tax ñun xam nan ne C moo ëpp solo.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Dafa doon xalaat ni dafay gaalankoor taagat yaramam**.

"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kañ la ap faasu copite di dikk?","The correct answer is **C: Ca Mars 10**

The text states ""Ay yëngu-yëngu suuf yu am solo te li ko waral mooy coppite yi amoon ci bisu 10 mars..."" which translates to ""Significant seismic activity occurred due to the changes on March 10..."" Therefore, the volcanic eruption happened on March 10.

*   **B: Dalam ci suuf nekk na ak ndam** - **This is correct.** The passage states it landed ""successfully.""

*   **C: Dañu ko sandeewoon ci ap orbitër bu ñu dëkkël** - **This is correct.** The passage states ""Chandrayaan-1 launched the Moon Impact Probe (MIP)"". Chandrayaan-1 is the orbiter.

*   **D: Dafa gadduwoon ñaari jumtukaay yu am solo lool** - **Incorrect.** The passage says it carried *three* scientific payloads.

**Therefore, A, B and C are correct choices.**"
"Di sukkëndiku ci lu ñu wax, ban faanu kaaraange ngir jangoro bi la ñuy mujjee tërël?","Based on the provided text, the following measures were taken to combat the disease:

*   **Setting up devices to monitor pig populations:** ""...tekk ay jumtukaay yuy wone maam xuux yi ci bërëb yi mbas mi gëna bare..."" This corresponds to **B: Luy japp mbaam xuux yi** (Trapping pigs).
*   **Distributing sand and poison:** ""...joxe ay junniy sànke ak wasaare posan."" This corresponds to both **A: Poson yi** (Poisons) and **D: Ay sanke yoo** (Sand). Given the context, ""sànke"" is likely referring to sand used for some sort of sanitation or vector control purpose. However, distributing poison is also explicitly mentioned.

However, the distribution of poison is a clearer and more direct action. Furthermore, the vaccines (C) are mentioned, and these are supposed to help with encephalitis, but aren't used yet to combat the spread.

**Therefore, the best answer is A: Poson yi**
"
Naka la feebar bi di waalee nit ñi?,"The correct answer is **C: Mbaam xuux yi** (Mosquitoes).

The passage explicitly states: ""Fébar bi ay mbaam xuux ñokoy joxé, yooyi ñookoy jox nitt ñi"" which translates to ""The disease is transmitted by mosquitoes, they transmit it to people"".
"
Lajju ñaareelu baat bi mën na yoobu ci ban mujjëntalu?,"The correct answer is **B: Ay aaku mbooloo ñu bokk awra ëlëg**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the challenge to the second phrase (concerning same-sex marriage) *could lead to future consideration of allowing same-sex marriage*. This directly corresponds to the idea of future ""aaku mbooloo ñu bokk awra"" (same-sex marriage).
The other options don't fit as well:
*   **A: Ap gëstuwaatu HJR-3 bu gaaw** This is possible, however the text is more specific about the outcome of this review
*   **C: Ap sesion legislativ ci bu gaaw** This is possible, however the text is more specific about the outcome of this review
*   **D: Tere uñon sivilu ñu bokk awra** This is the opposite of what the passage suggests."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kañ la ñu dindiwoon ñaareelu baat bi?","The correct answer is **C: Ci Altiné**.

The text states: ""Bénn coppité amoonna ci pégncum ndaw rééwmi bi gnaaréélu baat biko House of Representatives yi génné té jall ci bu mélnonu ci Senate Altiné."" This translates to ""An identical copy occurred in the wording of the proposed amendment where the second provision was removed by the House of Representatives and passed identically by the Senate on Monday."" Therefore, the second provision was removed on Monday (Altiné).
"

The passage states that the ""Keyiti Panama"" came from the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.

The text states that *the Guardian* pointed out that Deutsche Bank managed nearly a third of the 1200 brokerage offices to hide assets. It is implied that these are clients with wealth who are hiding assets."
Ban ci aksiden ropalaan yii toop moo amoon ay dee yu ëp?,"The correct answer is **A: Daanub ropalaan bu doon dem ca Armenie jogee ci Iran**.

The text states: ""Weer wii weesu Iran dund na jëye ji gëna mettii ci wàllu fafalndaaw bu daanu ba benn fafalndaaw bu doon dem Armeni daanoo, rey 168 nit ñi nekkoon ci biir."" This clearly indicates that the plane crash en route to Armenia had the highest number of fatalities (168).
"
Ban ci yii toop moo dul lu waral aksidenwu ay ropalaan yu baree bare yu am ci Iran?,"Answer: **C: Sanksion yuy tere njëndub ropalaan yu bees**

**Explanation:**

While options A and D might contribute, the primary reason highlighted in the passage is **C: Sanksion yuy tere njëndub ropalaan yu bees**.

The passage explicitly states:

*   ""Allamaanu bitim réew day tekki ni kenn du mëna jënd fafalnaaw bu bées."" (Foreign sanctions mean that no one can buy new airplanes.)
*   ""lu ëpp ci roppalaanu saldaar ak tukki yi dañu màgget"" (Most military and passenger planes are old.)

This indicates that the inability to purchase new aircraft due to sanctions is a major contributing factor to the aging fleet and the increased risk of accidents. Therefore, C is the most direct and accurate answer based on the provided text.

**Why the other options are less directly supported:**

*   **A: Ap flotu ay ropaalaan sivil ak militeer yu magget (An aging fleet of civil and military aircraft):** While true, the text explains *why* the fleet is aging (due to sanctions), making C the more fundamental reason.
*   **B: Ñàkkub budse ngir jënd ay ropalaan yu bees (Lack of budget to buy new airplanes):** This is also likely true, but the passage explicitly links the inability to buy new planes to sanctions, making C a stronger and more directly supported answer.
*   **D: Ap topatoo bu baaxul bu flotu ay ropalaan (Poor maintenance of the aircraft fleet):** The text doesn't explicitly mention this, although it's a possible consequence of having an aging fleet and limited resources. However, the *primary* reason given in the passage is the inability to replace old planes.
"
Ban ci yii toop moo dul lu ñu boolewul woon ci rapoor bu guruupu gëstu bu Irak?,"The correct answer is **C: Xelalu aar diggu Irak yi**.

The report discusses:

*   The possibility of avoiding increased violence and sectarian conflict (related to B).
*   A plea for consensus within the US on Middle East policy (related to D).
*   The need to address the plight of Iraqi refugees (related to A).

However, there's no mention of **""Xelalu aar diggu Irak yi"" (a plan to protect Iraq's center)** in the summary. So, that's the element NOT included in the report as described."
Ban ci yii toop la guruup gëstu bu Irak bi junjul ci rapooram?,"The correct answer is **B: Ap copite yoon ci bu gaaw**

Here's why:

*   The report *does* mention the need for open discussion (C: Jëfëndikoo ay waxtaan yu ubbeeku), diplomatic engagement (D: Samp ap inisiativ diplomatik bu bees), and says no one can guarantee that current actions will prevent increased violence (A: Ni ñu wax ap garaanti muy dagal fitna mii di yokku).

*   The report calls for a swift change in Iraqi political leadership (soppi ci lu gaaw ñi jiite) but doesn't specifically say “copite yoon ci bu gaaw”.

Therefore, option B is the one thing that the Iraqi Study Group did *not* call for in its report."
"Jëm ci lu poliis wax, kan la ñu jappeewoon ni ndeyjooru loxo wu Provenzano?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

The text says: ""Waa Police wax nañu ci mëna luñu dara Lo Piccolo ndax dafa jege woon lool Provenzano ca Palermete..."" which translates to ""The Police said they knew something about Lo Piccolo because he was very close to Provenzano in Palermo..."" This implies a close working relationship, making Lo Piccolo the likely answer.
"
"Di sukkëndiku ci xebaar bu ñu joxe ci lu ñu wax, lan moo indiwoon deewu Falcone?","Based on the provided text (P), the correct answer is:

**A: Dañu ko réeyoon ci xareeg Riina-driven**

The text states that Giovanni Falcone was killed at the end of the Riina-driven war. This clearly indicates that his death was a result of the conflict instigated by Riina.

Fan la Iwasaki jeemee daw di def ay digge?,"The correct answer is **A: Japon**.

The passage states that Iwasaki was captured in India, implying he was trying to escape *to* India, not *from* it. Since the other locations (Nepal, Tibet) are where bad things happened to him, we can infer he was likely trying to return home to Japan.
"
Kan moo songoon Iwasaki?,"Correct Answer: C: Ap xaj

The passage clearly states ""xaj bu soxor songu ko ca Tibet"" which translates to ""a rabid dog attacked him in Tibet"".
"
Kañ la Alonso tej dawam?,"The correct answer is **C: Ba Schumacher tejee dowam** (After Schumacher finished his race).

The passage states: ""Michael Schumacher jeexal na rawanteem laata Alonso di ko def..."" which translates to ""Michael Schumacher finished his race before Alonso did...""
"
Lu waral Schumarcher jeexal dowam ci bu teel?,"The correct answer is **D: Domaasu suspensionwu woto bi**.

The passage states that Michael Schumacher finished the race early ""ndax sukkandikukaay yu yàkku ci xeex yu bare yi ci biir rawante gi,"" which translates to ""due to suspension damage from multiple incidents during the race.""
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kan la liggéeyam di fiksé kosion ngir nit yu ñu japp?","The correct answer is **D: Komiseeru àttekaay ba**.

The text states that the *kimiseer bi ñu ko denk* (the commissioner who is tasked) is the one who dictates the *daan bi* (the fine/penalty), and if it's accepted, he directs the officer who arrested the person to write the legal procedures. While the text doesn't directly state ""fixing bail,"" the commissioner's role in determining the *daan* (penalty) is the closest description to setting bail. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Alkaati miy jappaate (The judge):** While judges are involved in legal proceedings, this text specifies the commissioner's role in setting the initial penalty.
*   **B: Juus Glynn (Judge Glynn):** Judge Glynn issued a ruling, but isn't the one setting bail.
*   **C: Sentaraalu reservasion bi (The reservation center):** This is simply where people are held, they don't have the authority to set bail."
"Jëm ci ordonaansu teye bu di ngir ap diir bu gaat ci lu ñu bind, lan la nit yu ñu japp wara am ngir ñu teye leen lu ëp 24 waxtu?","The correct answer is **B: Ap ndaje ak alkaati bu leen japp**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that Judge Glynn's ruling prevents people from being detained for more than 24 hours *unless* they are called for a hearing.

Therefore, the answer **B: Ap ndaje ak alkaati bu leen japp** is the correct answer."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bii, ban sabab lañu jëfandikoowul ngir leeral palum njiit buñu fomm?","The correct answer is **D: Ñaka leer gi am ci konstitisioŋ bi (The lack of clarity in the constitution)**.

Here's why:

* **P** states: ""Diplomat yi neena ñu gis nañu ci konstitusiyong Afghan ay lëndëm lëndëm yu doy ngir wax ne jongante jaru ko."" This translates to: ""Diplomats said they saw enough ambiguity in the Afghan constitution to say that the election is not necessary."" ""Lëndëm lëndëm"" means ambiguity or lack of clarity.

The other options are mentioned as reasons for cancelling the election, but not directly as a justification for appointing a leader. The diplomats in particular are using the ambiguity in the constitution as the reason why elections aren't necessary.

Therefore, the answer is **D**.
"
Lu tax dipolomat yi jàppoon ni ñaareelu pal gi lu ñakka solo la?,"The correct answer is **C: Dafa amoon ab lëndëm-lëndëm ci konstitisioŋ bi**.

The passage states: ""Diplomat yi neena ñu gis nañu ci konstitusiyong Afghan ay lëndëm lëndëm yu doy ngir wax ne jongante jaru ko.""  This translates to ""Diplomats said they saw enough ambiguities in the Afghan constitution to say the effort wasn't worth it."" This directly supports option C.

Kan mooy jox FATA ay sàrwiisi yoon?,"The answer is **A: Nguuru Pakistan bi (The Government of Pakistan)**

Here's why:

* **Q asks**: Kan mooy jox FATA ay sàrwiisi yoon? (Who provides legal services to FATA?)

The passage states that employees provide the government and banks operating in the legal field with legal services under Article 247 of the Constitution of Pakistan. Therefore, the government of Pakistan is the entity providing legal services to FATA.

Let's eliminate other options:
* **B**: Ndawal Polotik yi (Political Agents): While mentioned, their role is administrative, not directly providing legal services.
* **C**: Njiitu réewi Pakistan (President of Pakistan): The President plays a role, but it's the government as a whole that provides the services.
* **D**: Nguuru Biritanik bi (The British Government): Pakistan gained independence in 1947, so the British government is not providing legal services at this time.

*   Actor (Acteur yu gena rañeku)
*   Actress (Actrice yu gena rañeku)
*   Director (Njiit)
*   Cinematography (Sinematogarafi)

*   Production Design (njureef defar)
*   Sound Editing (Defar ab deglu)
*   Sound Mixing (Boole ay deglu)
*   Original Song (Ekaraan piire)

The text did not mention nomination for Visual Effects. Hence the correct answer is B.

    *   The issue of the Jordan Valley, specifically Israel's desire for a military presence for ten years after an agreement, and the PA's desire for their removal after five. This relates to **C: Teewaayi militeer yi ci Vallée bi**.

*   **P does *not* directly mention:**
    *   The *reasons* for the 1967 war. It only uses the 1967 war as a reference point.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Li waral geeru 1967**."
Ban ci yile moo nekkul benn ci càkkutéefi Palestine?,"The passage mentions the following Palestinian concerns:

*   **Foroñceer yu àju ci ay anami li jiitu geer bi**: The passage states that ""Palestine bëg sunu sukkandikoo ci foroñceer yi laata Geeru Moyen Orient ci atum 1967""
*   **Tontu yu àju ci ëllëgu Jerusalem**: The passage mentions ""réew Jerusalem buñuy waaja sos biñu jox raaya ñaari réew yi"".
*   **Ab teewaayu militeer bu toll ci juróomi at ci Vallée bi:** The passage mentioned this as it related to PA wanting to remove military presence after five years

Israel is the one requesting a military presence for 10 years, while the PA is requesting a removal of any presence after 5 years. The PA does not want a continued military presence in the Jordan Valley and would prefer for military personnel to be gone after 5 years, thus the option that is not a concern of Palestine is:

*   **B: Teewaayu militeer buy wey ci Vallée bu Jordanie**

**Therefore, the correct answer is B.**"
Ci ban réew la Ma jangee mbirum ateb yoon?,"The correct answer is **A: Etats-unis bu Amerig**.

The text states that Ma attended Harvard Law School in New York. Harvard Law School is located in the United States.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ndimbalu ban réew moo jàpp ci ndam li Ma am ci pal mi?","The correct answer is **D: Chine**.

Here's why:

The passage states that after the accusations against Ma, he was successful in a role ""di diggal jokko yu gëna jege ak waa Siin"" - which means ""facilitating closer communication with the Chinese.""  This directly links his success to China.
"
"Niñ ko waxee ci xët bi, kan la Carolyn Wilson daan liggéeyal laata muy joge ci dëkk bi?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**.

The text states, ""njaboot yu bari yu ci bokk gis nañu ci saasi ni Carolyn Wilson bu OHA dafa sàcc xaalis biñu dugaloon ngir garanti ba noppi mu daw genn réew mi,"" which means ""many families present realized that Carolyn Wilson of OHA stole the money they had put in for security and then fled the country."" This clearly identifies Carolyn Wilson as being associated with the OHA.
"
"Ci ñeenti rawante yu des ci pàcc bi, kan moo jël ñeenteelu palaas bi ci Championnat dawalkati roplaan yi?","The correct answer is **D: Bowyer**.

The text says, ""Ci ñatteelu palaas bi, rawee nañu Hamlin ñaar fukki poñ, waaye rawee na Bowyer juróomi poñ."" This means that Bowyer is just behind Hamlin in points, and since Hamlin is in third place, Bowyer must be in fourth place. The question asks who is in fourth place, so the answer is Bowyer."
"Li topp ci rawantane bi ñu def ci xët bi, ñaata poñ la Kahne am ci Championnat dawalkati roplaan yi?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**

The text states: ""Kahne ak Truex, Jr. Ñoo jël juróomeel ak juróom-benneeli palaas bi am 2 220 ak 2 207 poñ."" This means Kahne had 2220 points.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ñaata yoon la nit ñi fekee daanu metoworit yuy mujjee nekk yu bawoo ci planet mars?","The correct answer is **B: Juróomi yoon**

The passage states: ""Gëmm nañu ni bii mooy **juroomélu yoon** ci taarix nit di giss liy soppeeku nekk ay jumtukaayu xamxam martian yu daanu ci suuf."" which translates to: ""It is believed that this is the **fifth time** in history that people have discovered fallen Martian meteorites.""
"
"Niñ ko waxee ci xët bi, lan mooy li am dëgg ci xeer yuñu gis ni ci planet mars lañu cosaanoo?","The correct answer is **D: 34 ñoo ci am** (34 of them exist).

The passage states: ""Daanako ci 24 000 météorite yi ñu xamni ñoo daanu ci kaw suuf, 34 kese lañu dëggalagul ni ñoo ci jogee planete mars."" This translates to: ""Out of the 24,000 known meteorites that have fallen to Earth, only 34 have been confirmed to have originated from Mars.""
"
Kañ la Schumacher bayyi?,"The correct answer is **B: Bimu amee juróom ñaareelu ndamam bimu ci champonnat bi**

The passage states: ""Schumacher njëkkoon na bàyyi ci atum 2006 bi mu jëlee ndam li ci joŋanteb championnat Formule 1 juróom ñaari yoon"" which translates to ""Schumacher first retired in 2006, after winning the Formula 1 championship seven times.""
"
Kañ la Massa am ay gaañ-gaañu?,"The correct answer is **D: Laata paccu 2009 bi**

The text says that Massa got injured during the Grand Prix of Hungary 2009, and as a result, he couldn't participate in the rest of the 2009 season. This confirms that Massa's injury happened before the end of the 2009 season (or ""paccu 2009 bi"").
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo cu xët bi, nan la tëraliin wi di laalee AOL?","The correct answer is **B: AOL dina doon benn kër gu indi ay yokkute ci marsé messagerie instantanée bi.**

Here's why:

*   **P states:** *""Ba leegi, AOL mën na yëngal te yokk ja wu IM ci doxin bi mu bëgg...""* This translates to ""Currently, AOL can move and increase the market share of IM in its desired direction..."" This directly supports option B, which states that AOL is a company that will bring about changes in the instant messaging market.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Njort nañu ni limu wey-jëfandikoo AOL yi dina yokk.** While P mentions AOL can increase market share, it doesn't definitively state the number of AOL users will increase. It's more about their *influence* on the market.

*   **C: Limu wey-jëfandikukati AOL yi ay jëfandikukati Yahoo ak Microsoft ñooy diirante mbagg ak ñoom** P compares the combined number of Yahoo! and Microsoft users to AOL's, saying that the combined amount will be equal to the number of AOL customers.

*   **D: AOL dootu ñu ko jëfandikoowaat ci Etats-Unis** P states that AOL's spread within the US is the *reason* it can influence the market, implying it's still being used in the US.

"

"
Ñaata nit yuñu faat ci cong gi ñoo nekkul woon ay polisé?,"The correct answer is **C: 0**.

Here's why:

* The text says that two police officers were killed (""rey na ñaari takk der"").
* The text also says that 19 of the injured people were police officers (""fukk ak juróom ñent ci ñi amee ay gaañu-gaañu ay pëlisé lañuwoon"").
* The question asks how many *killed* people were not police officers. Since only police officers were reported to be killed, the answer is 0.
"
Kan moo boole kiñu jàpp ni mo waral cong gi?,"The correct answer is **A: Poliis**.

The passage states ""Poliss waxoon na ñoo ngi njoort ndawu bu jox boppam Desh (ISIL) mo def congu ji"" which translates to ""Police said they suspect a suicide bomber from Desh (ISIL) did the attack"". Therefore, the police are the ones who suspect who was responsible for the attack.
"
"Ndax tolluwaay Florinde biñu xamee ci réew mi xamne ki am ndam moo jël lépp, lan lañu jox Mitt Romney?","The correct answer is **C: Teewalkati réew mi yépp**

The text explicitly states that Florida awarded all of its 50 delegates to Romney. The delegates are the representatives, therefore, the correct answer is Teewalkati réew mi yépp (all representatives).
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban pusantaasu woote la Gingrich amoon ci pal gu njëkk gi?","The correct answer is **B: 32 ci teemer bo jël**.

The passage states that Newt Gingrich received 32% of the vote.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kan mo weyul di jiite biñu joxe résultats yu tukkee ci caucus?","The correct answer is **C: Perry**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Bachmann ended her campaign.
*   The passage states that Gingrich continued his campaign.
*   The passage states that Perry was unsure whether to continue in the race and was considering whether to drop out.
*   The passage does not explicitly state whether Romney continued, only that Gingrich criticized him.

Therefore, Perry is the only one whose continuation in the race is uncertain after the results."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kan mo tagg beneen candidat bi ñu joxee résultat yu tukkee ci caucus bi?","The correct answer is **B: Gingrich**.

The passage states that after the results were in, Gingrich congratulated Santorum but criticized Romney, accusing him of running negative campaigns against Gingrich in Iowa.
"
Fan mo nekkoon mennum barab bu ñu wonee emisioŋ bi laata 2015?,"The text says: ""Ci besam yu njëkk, xewaare gi wone na nu ko ci rajo gi ci lënd gi rekk TogiNet Radio, ab dalu web bu ajoo wax rajo."" This translates to ""In its early days, the event was only shown on online radio TogiNet Radio, a web platform dedicated to radio.""

Therefore, the answer is **A: Rajo TogiNet**.
"
Rajo bi dafay xamle emisioŋ niki lu am ban xeetu mujjantal?,"The correct answer is **B: Geek**.

The passage states that the radio show is considered ""théâtre radio kom nañu ko daan amalee bu njëkk, ci anamu geek jéggi dayo!"", which translates to ""radio theater as it used to be done, in an exaggerated geeky style!"".  Therefore, ""geek"" is the adjective used to describe the show's style.
"
Lan la David Headley taataan bamu mujjee tax ñu song kuréelu militaŋ yi?,"The correct answer is **A: Xibaar** (Information).

The text states that David Headley's ""ndajalém xibaar"" (information gathering) helped facilitate the attacks.
"
Ban xeetu dem ak dikk la kuréelu militaŋ yi jëfandikoo ngir tukki ca Mumbai?,"The correct answer is **C: Gaal**.

The passage clearly states ""ci gaal ci ñaar fukki fan ak juróom benn ci weeru Nowembar 2008"" which means ""by boat on the twenty-sixth day of November 2008.""
"
Ban wax mooy niru bu baax ak njuréefi Open bu Brisbane bu Nadal ak Raonic wax ci xët bi?,"The correct answer is **A: Raonic amna ndam ci kaw Nadal** (Raonic won against Nadal).

The passage states: ""Rekoor bi gëna mag ci Nadal ak doomu Kanadaa bii mooy 7-2. Raonic moo ko dóor bu yàggul dara ci à l'Open de Brisbane."" This directly translates to ""The head-to-head record between Nadal and this Canadian is 7-2. Raonic beat him recently at the Brisbane Open.""
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban toftalu joŋante bu Nadal ak Raonic buñu defee po mu njëkk mi?","The correct answer is **C: Score bi 7-2 la woon** (The score was 7-2).

The passage explicitly states: ""Rekoor bi gëna mag ci Nadal ak doomu Kanadaa bii mooy 7-2,"" which translates to ""The head-to-head record between Nadal and this Canadian player is 7-2."" This directly answers the question about the score between them before the mentioned match. The other options are incorrect as they refer to statistics *during* a match, not the overall record *before* the match.
"
Ban porogaraamu lakk moo bokkul woon ci ñetti emisioŋ yu Naked News?,"The correct answer is **C: Japonais**.

The passage states that Naked News initially broadcast in English and Japanese. The new programs are in Spanish, Italian, and Korean. Therefore, Japanese was already part of their offerings and not a new program.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, fan la emsioŋu Naked News bu bees bi dul am?","The correct answer is **C: Cinema yi**.

The passage states that Naked News is expanding to television, the website, and mobile phones, but it doesn't mention cinemas. Therefore, it will *not* be available on cinemas.
"
Ñaata joŋantekat ñoo jeexalul woon Giant Slalom bi?,"The text states, ""45 ci 117 skikat ci Giant Slalom bi lajj nañu ci raw gàddu gi."" This translates to ""45 out of 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom dropped out during the race.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: 45**.
"
Ban ci yile wax ñoo dëppoo bu naax ak njuréefi rawante yi amoon ci Championnat yi?,"Let's analyze each option based on the text provided:

*   **A: Ci ñaareelu rawante gi, Carpenado moo jiitu woon ab defkat ski bu dëkk Hongry** - (In the second race, Carpenado was ahead of a skier from Hungary). The text says Carpenado was *behind* Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary by 1:09.02, so this is false.

*   **B: 45 defkati ski jeexalu ñu woon seeni rawante ci Giant Slalom** - (45 skiers did not finish their race in Giant Slalom). The text states ""45 ci 117 skikat ci Giant Slalom bi lajj nañu ci raw gàddu gi"" which translates to ""45 of the 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom race dropped out."" This is true.

*   **C: Defkati ski yu jeexal Giant Slalom lu ëpp lu Slalom def** - (More skiers finished Giant Slalom than Slalom). 116-36 = 80 finished Slalom. 117-45 = 72 finished Giant Slalom. Therefore, more skiers finished Slalom than Giant Slalom. This statement is false.

*   **D: Carpenado fukkeelu palaas bi la jël ci Slalom bi** - (Carpenado took tenth place in the Slalom). The text says her best result in slalom was due to a disqualification (""Yeggali wu ko"" means disqualification). It also states she got 10th place in Giant Slalom. This is false.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B**.
"
Ban ci yile la NBA dogal ni dina ko dakkal?,"The correct answer is **D: Ekipu Basket bu Utah Jazz** (The Utah Jazz basketball team).

The text states that the NBA suspended the season after a player from the Utah Jazz tested positive for the Coronavirus-19 virus. This directly implicates the team as the reason for the suspension.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan moo waraloon ay jaaxle ci doomu jangoro bi?","The correct answer is **D: Ab joueur bu ekipu Utah Jazz lañu tésté positif** (A player from the Utah Jazz team tested positive).

The passage states that the NBA season was suspended after a Utah Jazz player tested positive for the Coronavirus. Option D is the closest and most accurate reflection of this information.
"
Kan moo dugal bit bi tax Washington Capitals am ndam ci seen joŋante ak waa Atlanta Thrashers?,"Based on the text, Alex Ovechkin earned an assist on the game-winning goal. The assist was for Nicklas Backstrom's goal.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Nicklas Backstrom**.
"
Kan mo dugal 60eelu bit ci saison bi ci joŋante bi amoon digante Capitals ak. Thrashers?,"The correct answer is C: Alex Ovechkin.

The passage states: ""...ñaareeluu bii bumu dugal ci guddi gi mooy 60eel bi ci sézon bi, bimu nekkee futbalkat bi njëkka dugal 60 bii wala yeneeni bii ci benn sézon..."" which translates to ""...the second goal he scored that night was his 60th of the season, making him the first player to score 60 or more goals in a single season...""

Therefore, Alex Ovechkin is the player who scored his 60th goal of the season in the game between the Capitals and Thrashers.
"
Kañ la banku Northern Rock soxla wee ndimbal ci nguur gi?,"The correct answer is **D: Ci jamanoy crise crédit immobilier bi (In the subprime mortgage crisis)**.

The text explicitly states that Northern Rock requested assistance due to difficulties during the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile wax mooy wone bu baax lëkkaloo yi Kuréefu Virgin al ak bank bu Northern Rock?","The correct answer is **B: Virgin Group moo ngi jënd bank biñ ko nationalisé ba noppi**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:**  ""Ci atum 2010, donte dañ ko nasiyonaalisé, bank bu bees bu Northern Rock pic dañ ko xaajale woon ak “Bank bu bon bi”, Northern Rock (Caytug Moomeel). Virgin dafa jënd rekk “good bank” bu Northern Rock, jëndul bànkaas gu yor ameef yi.""  This clearly indicates Virgin purchased the ""good bank"" *after* it had been nationalized.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Virgin Group jënd na itam këru sayru moomeelu Northern Rock** The passage says Virgin *did not* buy the ""bad bank"" (Caytug Moomeel), which held the asset management.
* **C: Virgin Group jox bank bi ndimbal lu jamp ci jamono crise crédit immobilier bi** The passage indicates it was the British government that gave emergency assistance during the subprime mortgage crisis.
* **D: Offre Virgin Group bu njëkk bi ñoo ngi ko amaloon biñu nationalisé bank bi ba noppi** The passage mentions Virgin made an initial offer before nationalization but it wasn't until after nationalization that they purchased the ""good bank.""
"
"Niñ ko waxee ci xët bi, ban réew la xaatimu deggoo jawwu bu Kyoto laal?","The correct answer is **A: États-Unis**.

The passage states that Prime Minister M. Rudd signing the Kyoto agreement would leave the United States as the only major power not to have ratified the agreement.
"
Nguuru Australie bu njëkk ci lan la xalatoon ni xaatim Kyoto dina indi ay lorange?,"The correct answer is **B: Koom-koomu réew mi** (The country's economy).

The passage states: ""Nguuru Australi gu conservative gu njëkk gi baañ na xaatim Kyoto, di wax doon na yàkk kom gi..."" which translates to ""The previous conservative government of Australia refused to ratify Kyoto, saying it would damage the economy...""
"
Ngir ban porogaraam lañu jëloon tireurs de piste yi?,"The correct answer is **B: Porogaraamu Park Conservation and Heritage**.

The text states: ""Buñu sukkeendiko ci Mick O’Flynn, Acting Directorr bi Park Conservation ak Heritage ak NPWS, gnénti natal kat yi gnu tan ngirr natal yu njeekk yi jotna gnu kaarangé ak taggat."" This clearly indicates that the shooters were chosen under the Park Conservation and Heritage program (in conjunction with NPWS).
"
Ban ci wax yii moo mengoowul bi baax ak testu xeex saan yi?,"The passage says rangers are monitoring the *plants* that are being used to fight parasites, not the ""tireurs"" (shooters). So option C is the one that is NOT a correct interpretation of the text.
Therefore, the answer is **C**.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, fan la xaajaloo gi nekkee?","The correct answer is **A: Ci Rift Valley (In the Rift Valley)**.

The text explicitly mentions ""Rift Valley Research Service ci Éthiopie"" (Rift Valley Research Service in Ethiopia). The question asks where the ""xaajaloo gi"" (the divergence/split) is located. While Ethiopia is the country, the Rift Valley is the specific geological location being referenced.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan moo xeetu ci lu gêna teel niñ ko yaakaare woon?","The correct answer is **B: Xaajaloo bo**.

The passage states: ""Sunu ko wéeree ci ay desitu rabb àll, dafay tekk ni tass gi am naa lu jiitu firnde molekuleer di ko waajal."" This translates to: ""If we look at the fossil remains of wild rabbits, it implies that the dispersal happened earlier than molecular evidence suggested.""  ""Tass gi"" (dispersal) refers to the dispersal or split of species, which is the same as ""xaajaloo bo"" (species split) in Wolof. Therefore, the fossils suggest an earlier species split than what molecular evidence indicates.
"
Lan la ab joueur wara def ngir amal yëngu-yëngu yuy am ci ab powu wideo?,"The correct answer is **D: Toxal contrôleur bi ci biir ngelaw li** (Move the controller in the air).

The passage explicitly states: ""Lii dina tax jogantekaat yi mëna ceytu jëf yi ak yëngu yi ci powum wideo jaare ko ci **toxal jumtukaay bi si ngelaw bi.**"" (This will allow players to control actions and movements in the video game by **moving the device in the air.**)

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fexel ba capteur yu controleur bi nekk ci wetu jumtukaay bi** (Ensure the controller's sensors are on the side of the device): The passage does not say that the sensors are on the side of the controller.
*   **B: Def seen taxawaay ci ñetti koñ** (Define their position in three corners): This refers to how the system calculates position, not what the player does.
*   **C: tegal capteur yi ci wetu seeni tele** (Place the sensors on the side of their TVs): The passage says that the sensors are attached to the TV, not the controller."
Lan lañu defar ngir mu nirook ab telecommande?,"The correct answer is **B: Manette Nintendo Revolution**.

The passage states that the ""komand bi dafay jëfandikoo ay kaptër yuñu tek ci wetu tele aji-jëfandikukat bi"" (the controller uses sensors placed near the user's TV). It also explicitly names the controller as the ""konsolu Nintendo Revolution"". Therefore, the controller is the one that is made to look like a TV remote.
"
Lan lañu waxul ci nettali bu njëkk bi ci këru yeneekaay bii di Xinhua.,"The correct answer is **A: Roplaan bi jot na ab dankaafu bomb**.

Here's why:

* **P states:** Later accounts mention the plane received a bomb threat and was diverted to Afghanistan, landing in Kandahar. The initial reports stated the plane was diverted to Afghanistan after being refused landing in Ürümqi.
* **Q asks:** What was NOT mentioned in the *initial* account from Xinhua news agency?

The *initial* account only mentioned the diversion to Afghanistan after being refused landing in Ürümqi. It did *not* mention the bomb threat or the landing in Kandahar. Of the provided choices, only option A was NOT mentioned in the initial reports.
"
Lan lañu waxul woon ci nettali bu njëkk bu këru yeneekaay bii di Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **D: Roplaan bi jotoon na ay fitna bomb.**

Here's why:

*   **P** states: ""Yeneeni nettali wax nañu roplaan bi jot na ab àartu bomb te dañ ko deturné mu dem ca Afganistan, mu wàcc ci Kandahar."" (Other accounts say the plane received a bomb threat and was diverted to Afghanistan, landing in Kandahar.)
*   **P** also says that the first report from the Chinese news agency said the plane was robbed (sacc nañu ko).

Therefore, the first report didn't mention the bomb threat."
Lan la Sara Danius yëgle ci emisioŋu rajo bi?,"The correct answer is **D: Komite bi dina dakkal ay jéegoom ngir jokkoo ak Bob Dylan**.

The text states that Sara Danius announced the committee stopped trying to contact Bob Dylan after being unable to reach him directly, and after receiving ""courteous replies"" from his closest associate.
"
Kan lañu mënul woon jot?,"The correct answer is **D: Bob Dylan**.

The passage clearly states that the committee was unable to reach Bob Dylan.
"
Kan moo wax ni doggu bi ab “jéego bu mage” la woon?,"The correct answer is **C: Gordon Johndroe**.

The passage states that ""Ki yor kàddu Bush di Gordon Johndroe, waxna ci matuwaay yi Corée du Nord jël, jàppee na ko """"jéego bu mag ci wàllu wàññi defarug ngànnaayu nucleaire ci anam wuñ mëna saytu""""."" which translates to ""Bush's spokesman, Gordon Johndroe, spoke about North Korea's actions, calling it """"a major step in reducing nuclear weapons development in a verifiable manner.""""""

Therefore, Gordon Johndroe is the one who described the action as a ""jéego bu mag"" (major step).
"
Ñaata timbre la Słania defar ngir ay réew yu bari?,"The correct answer is **A: Lu ëpp 2 000** (More than 2,000).

The passage states that Słania designed over 1000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries. Therefore, the total number of stamps he designed must be more than 2000.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan moo wara waral sennug barigo yi?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: taweeku termik (thermal expansion)**.

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""...ngenlawi reservoir yi ñoo nekkoon di seen te jàpp nañu ni liko waral mooy yokkutey limuy génnee ci biir reservoir bi."" This translates to ""...reservoir overflows were occurring and it was believed to be caused by increased throughput in the reservoir"". Increased throughput within the reservoir may be caused by thermal expansion.

*   The text does mention a spill at Fort Greely, but it specifies that it was *next to* pumping station 9, not *in* it. Also, that spill was caused by a failed pressure regulator, not directly related to the reservoir overflows.

* There is no mention of a test, routine or otherwise.

* There is no mention of a second confinement area being full."
Lu tax soupape de décharge yi ubbeeku?,"The correct answer is **A: Dafa amoon ab taaweeku termik ci biir barigo yi.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Kurang bu kupe gannaaw ba nu bësee benn taalukaay bu nu daan faral di bës ngir ceytu ab jumtukaay moo tax jumtukaay bay yamale jalluu petorol gi ubbeeku te petorol bu kenn laalagul tuuru ci wetu pompu estasiyong 9 bu Fort Greely."" This clearly states the release was due to a thermal event/issue related to equipment."
"Fimne nii, fan la kawewaayu ndox mi toll ci Ninth Ward ?","The correct answer is **A: 20 tank**

The passage clearly states: ""Koñ bii di Ninth Ward, moo am tay ay inondation 20 pied ginaaw bi fa ouragan Katrina jaaree"" which translates to ""The Ninth Ward currently has 20 feet of flooding after Hurricane Katrina passed through.""
"
Ci jamonoy ngelawu Katrina lan mo xewoon ci Ninth Ward?,"The correct answer is **C: Ndox yu am doole yi demoon nañu ba 20 tank ci kawewaay (The strong waters went up to 20 feet in height)**.

Here's why:

*   The text in P states: ""Koñ bii di Ninth Ward, moo am tay ay inondation 20 pied ginaaw bi fa ouragan Katrina jaaree..."" which translates to: ""The Ninth Ward experienced floods of 20 feet after Hurricane Katrina passed through...""
"
Ban ci yile la Hamilton firndéelul woon?,"Jéggal ma, waaye man xamuma Wolof. Ndax man ngaa léral sama lambaaram?"
Lan la nit yu xarañ yi bëgg a xam?,"The best answer is **D: Nan lañu tëggee Suuf si**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the impact of comets on the early Earth.** It specifically mentions how comets *may* have brought organic molecules and facilitated the origin of life.  Understanding how the Earth was formed *after* comet impacts is the most direct question the passage raises.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as good:

* **A: Bi Cometes yi mbëkantee ak Suuf si:** While the *timing* of comet impacts is relevant, the primary interest isn't just *when* they happened, but *what were the results?*
* **B: Nan la proteines yi di formé wo:** The passage mentions comets possibly bringing proteins, but the overarching question is the formation of Earth, not the detailed formation of proteins themselves.
* **C: Lan mooy matière organique:** While understanding organic matter is important, the passage uses it in the context of Earth's formation, making ""How was Earth formed?"" the broader and more central question.

Therefore, **D** is the most accurate reflection of the research question implied in the passage.

Lan mo xew ci dugukaayi tube yi biñuy tëj?,"The correct answer is **A: Dañ leen boloké woon** (They were blocked).

The passage states that they used garbage trucks to block the road. Therefore, the entrances to the tubes (presumably referring to tunnels or roads) were blocked.
"

Lan la ab fotogaraaf nekkoon di jéema def laata ndamaar bi di ko mbëkk?,"The correct answer is **B: Jël ay foto ci stop bu poliis bi** (Taking pictures at a police stop).

The text states that the photographer stopped his car on the other side of Sepulveda Boulevard and then tried to photograph him (the subject) at a police stop.
"
Ban wax mo dul xamle ci anam gu leer fi wergu-yaramu njiitu réew mi toll biñ ko testé positif ci doomu jangoro bi?,"The correct answer is **B: Baatam dafay metti**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions Arias having ""tangooru yaram ak put buy metti"". ""Put buy metti"" translates to ""throat hurts"" or ""sore throat"". Therefore, Arias is experiencing throat pain.
*   All the other options are true according to the passage, making them incorrect.

"
"Suu sukkandikoo ci xët bii, ban ci yile wax ci laju ci njiitu réew mi mooy dëgg?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: Dina des ci këram ay ayu-bis** (He will stay at home for many days).

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Bëgg bëggu njiitu réew mi yamamaay na, tamit dina ñu ko bér ci këram ci ay fan yu beeri."" which translates to ""The president's health is stable, and he will stay at home for many days.""

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: Yaramam tangul** (He doesn't have a fever): The text says: ""Soo ci gennee tangooru yaram ak put buy metti..."" which means ""Apart from the fever and headache..."" Thus, the president *does* have a fever.
*   **C: Wer na bu baax ngir liggéey ci këram** (He is well enough to work at home): The text says: ""Ma ngi yëg tàn bu baax te am naa cawarte ngir def sama liggéey"" which translates to ""I feel well and have courage to do my work"", so he is indeed able to work. However, the core information available in the text is that he *will* be in his house for several days.
*   **D: Dafa am doomu jangoro bu garaaw** (He has a severe illness): The text says: ""Dañoo gisoon ni Arias dafa amé doomu-jangoro budul feeñ"" which translates to ""They saw that Arias has an invisible sickness,"" suggesting a mild, asymptomatic illness. The text doesn't say the president has a severe illness."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kañ lai Cyclone Tropical Gonu nara wey di wàññeeku?","Jàppandal bu baax mooy: **B: Bi ngelaw wàccee ba ci 83 kilomeetar ci waxtu wu nekk**

Lan mo nekkoon gaawaayu ngelaw yi ci li gëna foor bu Tropical Cyclone Gonu?,"The correct answer is C: 149 miles waxtu wu nekk

The passage states that the highest wind speed of Tropical Cyclone Gonu was 240 kilometers per hour (149 miles per hour). The question asks for the *highest* speed, and option C provides the equivalent in miles per hour.
"
Ban ci yile mbir lañu jàppee niki ab rëddu raññeekaayu Karenia brevis?,"The correct answer is **B: Mën na dakkal siditi doomu adama**.

Here's why:

* The passage says: ""Waag dafay defar benn xeet tooke bu mëna dindi doxinu siddit yi ci nit ñi ak jën yi."" (The algae produces a toxin that can disrupt the nervous system in humans and fish). ""Dindi doxinu siddit yi"" means ""disrupt the nervous system"", and ""dakkal siditi doomu adama"" is a paraphrase of that concept.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ab xeetu garab buy sax si géej la** (It's a type of plant that lives in the sea). The passage refers to it as waamé bu xonk Karenia brevis bu geenee kawé té far mokoy joxé, bénn amaline-ci ci géj aalam késé ab mbir (a red algae Karenia brevis that creates high and releases poison)

*   **C: Dafa bari ay cellules** (It has many cells). While algae are made of cells, the passage doesn't specifically highlight that as a key characteristic of Karenia brevis.

*   **D: Dafay ab natirelma** (It is a natural element). This is too vague. Everything alive is ""natural,"" but this doesn't distinguish Karenia brevis.
"
Ban ci mbir yii la Karena brevis mënul def?,"The correct answer is **D: Defar ab neutroxine**.

Here's why:

*   **P states:** ""Waamé bu xonk Karenia brevis bu geenee kawé té far mokoy joxé, bénn amaline-ci ci géj aalam késé ab mbir."" (A red tide caused by Karenia brevis releases toxins and causes environmental concerns.) This implies **C: Laal ndox mi** (Contaminates the water).

*   **P states:** ""Ndogali sunu boroom yu baax mën na waral màggug algues yi gaaw, te bari ba yegg fu ñu xalaatee wul woon."" (Favorable conditions can cause algae to grow rapidly and extensively.) This supports **B: Yokk ci lu gaaw ci ay lim ci anam bumu mëna doon** (Increase rapidly in numbers in an uncontrolled manner).

*   **P states:** ""Waag dafay defar benn xeet tooke bu mëna dindi doxinu siddit yi ci nit ñi ak jën yi. Yenn saay liy faat jën yi ci biir ndox mi mooy, ndox mi dafay faral di am tooke yu bari ci biir."" (The tide produces a type of toxin that can affect the nervous system of humans and fish. Sometimes what kills the fish in the water is that the water tends to have high concentrations of toxin.) This supports **A: Dakkar siditu jën** (Affect the nervous system of fish).

*   **P states** there is mention of ""tóoke"" (toxins). There is no mention of neurotoxins being made.

Therefore, Karenia brevis is not stated to make a neurotoxin."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci ët bi, ban ci yile mbir mo amul woon bi Ouranga Felicia ñëwee?","D: Mbënd yu ci tali bi

The passage states that ""fi nu toll nii, yëglewunu benn yàkku yàkku wala mbënd"" which means ""so far, no damage or flooding has been reported."" Therefore, flooding (mbënd) did not occur.
"
Ban wax ci Ouraga Felicia mo nekkul dëgg?,"The correct answer is **B: Dañ ko njëkk jàppee niki ab depression tropical laata muy nekk ab tampetu 4 wàll** (It was first considered a tropical depression before becoming a Category 4 hurricane).

The passage states that Felicia *weakened* to a tropical depression *before* dissipating.  It was originally a Category 4 hurricane. Therefore, the statement that it started as a tropical depression is incorrect.
"

Liggéey bu baax!"
Fan la aksidaŋ bi amee?,"The passage states that Piquet Jr.'s crash in the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix helped Fernando Alonso win. It also says that Alonso's previous pit stop was timed to coincide with the safety car, giving him an advantage. Therefore, the accident must have occurred **before the safety car came out** to give Alonso the edge. Thus, option **C: Laata woto kaarànge bi di génn** (Before the safety car came out) is the most accurate.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile mo jëloon diir bu gëna ndaw bu gëstukat yaakaaroon ci njëlbéen?","D: Maggaay espèce yi

**Explanation:**

The text in the passage (P) says that the researchers found a new species forming in only two generations. This means the *growth/development* of the species (Maggaay espèce yi) was surprisingly fast. The other options aren't directly related to something happening faster than expected.
"
Ban ci yile la gëstukat yi nettaliwul?,"The correct answer is **C: Turu espèce yu bees yi** (The names of the new species).

The passage explicitly mentions:

*   **A: Fan lañu formé espèce yu bees yi** (Where the new species formed): They formed on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
*   **B: Yagaayu maggaay bi** (The duration of the development): They developed in just two generations.
*   **D: Picc yu bokk ci yar bi** (The birds involved in the breeding): The breeding occurred between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.

The passage doesn't mention the *names* of the new species.
"
Fan la CowParade di amee?,"The correct answer is **B: Ci dëkku taaxu Bucharest**

The text states that the event is part of a Bucharest City Hall campaign.
"
Ban ci yile wax ñooy xamle bu baax CowParade?,"Based on the provided text (P), here's the breakdown:

*   **P** describes an event designed to rebrand Bucharest. It is also the largest folk art event in Eastern Europe (between May and October).

Considering this:

*   Option **C: Ab xew-xew fent buñu amaloon ci jamonoy tangooru Orop bëj-saalum feete penku** (A folk art event held during the summer in Southeastern Europe) aligns best with the information provided in text P.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C**."
Lan moo waraloon Risi mu ajandi jëfandikoo II-76?,"The correct answer is **B: Ab aksidaŋ (An accident)**.

The passage states that Russia quickly grounded II-76s after an accident in October where a plane crashed during takeoff. This directly implies that the accident was the reason for suspending the use of the II-76s.
"
Lan mooy II-76?,"The correct answer is **C: Ab roplaan** (An airplane).

The passage states: ""Fafalndaaw bi mi ngi jubali Irkutsk te ay takk der yu nekk ci biir ñoo ko doon doxal. II-76 bi dafa nekkoon aab pàcc bu mag bu takk deru Russe yi ak Sowiet yi ci 1970...""

This translates to: ""The plane was heading to Irkutsk and was being operated by a crew. The II-76 was a major element of the Russian and Soviet air force in the 1970s...""

Therefore, II-76 is a type of airplane.
"
Kan moo jël kuréelu bind bi ngir Les Simpsons?,"The correct answer is **B: Simon**.

The passage states ""Ci atum 1989 dafa jàppale nu defar Simpsons yi ak Brooks ak Groening, te nekkoon na njiit buy jël kureel gi njëkka bind film bi."" which translates to ""In 1989 he helped create The Simpsons with Brooks and Groening, and he was the leader gathering the team that first wrote the film"". This clearly identifies Simon as the leader who gathered the writing team.
"
"Ci xalaatu Fluke, mi ko daan yónnee addu ak ay waaw-goor?","The correct answer is **D: Ay góor ak ay jigéen** (Men and women).

The text says Fluke believes *men and women* punish her for expressing her opinions on reproductive health and for advocating for abortion.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan la yenn nit yi bëggul wax?","The correct answer is **C: Wergu-yaramu jigéen ñi (Women's health)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""Fluke bind na ni ñenn ñi jotu ñu mëna tere jigeen ñi wax ci seen wergu-yaram."" This translates to ""Fluke claims that some people are trying to prevent women from talking about their health.""
*   Therefore, these ""some people"" (represented by ""ñenn ñi"") don't want women to talk about their health."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban palanet moo gëna yëngu?","The text describes something transparent like water, and then states that a celestial body is more transparent than Titan, and that its name is ""Suuf"" (Earth). Therefore, the answer is **B: Titan** (because Earth is *more* transparent than Titan, implying Titan is less transparent).
"
Ay dex ak ay déeg yu am ndox yu mu leer lañu gis ci ban palaanet?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

The passage describes a place with clear liquid bodies of water, so clear you can see the rocks and debris at the bottom. It explicitly states that this place, with these clear water bodies, is on Titan.

"

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan lañuy amaati fii ak jëfu tuuma bi?","The correct answer is **B: Siiwal ay nataal**.

The text explicitly mentions that publicizing the image of Adekoya has made it difficult to find an impartial witness due to excessive publicity. The case is sensitive, and Scottish law is stricter about publicity than English law.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan nekkul ab jafe-jafe ci jaaykat yi fimne nii?","The correct answer is **A: Anami jawwu yu tàr (Fine weather conditions)**.

Here's why:

*   **P** describes problems with glass quality (""kilimaa yu metti dafa baare jeego wàllu yi"" - bad conditions affect quality) and potentially its quantity (""pittman diggle na anam yi du soppeeku ba beneen ayubés wa"" - Pittman ordered that the types not change until the next period). It also implies a problem with the supply chain, saying it used to be owned by people known to go to sea. This suggests issues with sourcing and availability.

*   **Q** asks what ISN'T a problem.

The other options are linked to the problems described in the passage:

*   B: Dayoob galaas (Glass quality) - Directly mentioned as a problem.
*   C: Tàccaayu galaas gi (Glass supply) - Implied as a problem through the mention of previous owners.
*   D: Seeyug galaas gi (Glass demand) - Not mentioned or suggested as an issue.

Therefore, the passage does not mention fine weather conditions as a problem.
"
"Suñ ci dollee galas gi, lan mooy indi ay lorange ci liñuy jéema def ay sowetaas?","The answer is **D: Rëbkat yi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes issues with the glass:** It mentions difficulties working with the glass, hard words that break the edges, and Pittman's order to keep the style the same.  It also links the type of glass to poor quality glass used by sailors in the past.  This implies the *glass itself* is problematic.

* **The question (Q) asks about adding the glass to soletas and causing orange:** This directly suggests the glass itself is causing the issue.  Orange discoloration is often associated with certain types of glass degrading or interacting with the materials around them.

* **Analyzing the options:**

    * **A: Ñakkum jumtukaay (Lack of equipment):** While lack of proper tools can cause problems, it wouldn't specifically cause an orange coloration *when adding the glass*.
    * **B: Anami jawwu (Atmospheric conditions):** Atmospheric conditions might affect the overall process of making soletas, but again, it wouldn't be the *addition of the glass* that directly causes the orange color.
    * **C: Ñakkum ndimbal (Lack of assistance):** Lack of help is a general problem-solving issue, not an orange-color-specific issue.
    * **D: Rëbkat yi (Impurities):** *Impurities* in the glass are the most likely cause of orange discoloration. These impurities could react with the ingredients of the soletas to make the orange color.

**Therefore, impurities within the glass are the logical reason for the color change.**

"
Ban tomb la Roberts jàpp ni dafa wuute woon ak xalaat yu baax yi ci waxtaan?,"The correct answer is **B: Dogalu Roe v. Wade**.

The text states that Roberts initially called Roe v. Wade ""the settled law of the land"" but later brought up the ""merits"" of the Supreme Court's decision. This suggests a potential disagreement or at least a reconsideration of the Roe v. Wade ruling. The rest of the answer choices do not appear in the text.
"
Fan la ñaari weti leeraay nekkee di takk?,"The correct answer is **A: Ci kaw asamaan si**

The passage states: ""Samp nañu ñaari faisceau lumière yuy niit asmaan si su guddi jotee."" This translates to ""They have installed two beams of light that shine in the sky when night falls.""
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kan lañu tabax etaas yu maga mag yi ci barab bi?","The correct answer is **D: Tabax baa ngi wey (Construction is ongoing)**.

The passage states ""Ñu ngi tabaxaat yeneen juróomi gratte-ciel yu bees ci barab bi"" which translates to ""They are rebuilding five more new skyscrapers on the site"". This implies the construction is currently happening, so ""Tabax baa ngi wey"" is the most accurate answer.
"
Yan xibaar ñooy wone ni The Seven Sisters ay xeer yu mag lañu?,"The correct answer is **A: Coppitey temperatiir**.

Here's why:

* **The quote states:** ""Ño gene seed diwaan yi wër ci bés bi ak tang ci guddi bi."" (They emit cold during the day and heat during the night). This directly refers to temperature variations. This difference in temperature suggests a lack of thermal inertia, which is consistent with rocky material.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Rëdd buy xaajale buntu xeer yu mag yi:** This is not described in the text
* **C: Lanketi géologue yi:** Though Glen Cushing is a geologist, the information is only what he has stated.
* **D: Nataali xeer yu mag yi ci Suuf si:** Although photographs are mentioned, there is no description of them showing large boulders on Earth.
"
Nan lañuy saytoo doxaliinu thermal bu Seven Sisters?,"The text explicitly states that ""Nataal efararuus wonena coppite ci jawwu ji guddi ak bëcëg di wone ay bërë la."" This directly translates to infrared imagery showing the day and night temperature differences.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Nataali infrarouge**.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban wax bu aju ci ki ñu njort moo nekkul dëgg?","Based on the text provided:

*   **P says:** Gorgui melna ko don dawal oto ñetti panu bu andak lu mëna rey mboolo (Gorgui is suspected of driving a three-panel car with something that can kill people). This implies **B: Wax nañu ni dafa kalaatel ab bomb** is likely true (or at least, a strong suspicion).
*   **P says:** Turam ba léegi kilifa yi xamu nu ko, donte xam nanu bu baax ne ci xeeti Uighur yi lanu bokk. (His name is still unknown to the authorities, although they know very well that he belongs to the Uighur people). This means **C: Njiit yi xam nañu waaso bimu bokk** is **FALSE**. They know his *ethnic group* (Uighur), but not his name.
*   **P says:** ...ginnaw ay gaañu gaañu ci kalaté gi. (...after injuries in the attack). This means **D: Gaañu ñu ko woon** is **FALSE**. He *was* injured.

Therefore, the answer that is NOT true based on the text is **C: Njiit yi xam nañu waaso bimu bokk**.
Option A (Dafa jëfandikoo ab ndamaar ci jamonoy cong bi - He used a hammer during the colonial era) is not mentioned in the text at all, so we cannot determine its truth.
The best answer is **C**."
Yan xibaar yu àju ci cong bi la njiit yi firndeel?,"The correct answer is **B: Waaso ki ñuy tuumal**.

The passage states:

*   Gorgui melna ko don dawal oto ñetti panu bu andak lu mëna rey mboolo (Someone resembling Gorgui drove a truck loaded with explosives). This refers to the **waaso ki ñuy tuumal** (the person suspected).

The other options are less relevant based on the information provided:

*   **A: Xibaari raññeekaayi complice yi** (Information about the characteristics of accomplices): While there might be accomplices, the passage primarily focuses on the driver.
*   **C: Li ñu nàmm ci cong bi** (What they desire from the investigation): The passage doesn't explicitly state what the authorities want from the investigation.
*   **D: Tur ak santu ki ñuy tuumal** (Name and surname of the person suspected): The passage says that the authorities *don't* know the name of the suspect.

Therefore, the information about the suspect himself is the most directly referenced.
"

The text states: ""Pàcc mu mujju bi jëm ci mboolem jongante yi dina ñu ko amal ci bërëb Ellis Park ca Johannesburg ayubés bidi ñëw, su Springboks di jogante ak Óstraali.""  This means the Springboks (South Africa) will be playing against Óstraali (Australia) at Ellis Park.
"

The text says: ""Pàcc mu mujju bi jëm ci mboolem jongante yi dina ñu ko amal ci bërëb Ellis Park ca Johannesburg ayubés bidi ñëw, su Springboks di jogante ak Óstraali."" This translates to: ""The last part for all the matches will be held at Ellis Park in Johannesburg next weekend, when Springboks will play against Australia.""
"
Ak yan mbir la yi may waaja lim la station spatiale bi amal ay jafe-jafe bimuy def mission bi?,"Based on the context provided, the correct answer is **B: Teye ab gyroscope**.

Here's why:

* **The passage speaks about problems with the navigational system (""doxinu jekkalaatu gindikaay yi"") and the need to re-establish a stable position (""tolluwaay bu wóor"").** Gyroscopes are crucial for maintaining stability and orientation in space. A malfunctioning gyroscope would directly lead to problems with navigation and attitude control.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Weyal digante bu baax bi ak meykati doole yi (Maintain proper distance from energy sources/suppliers)**: While important for general station operation, this doesn't directly relate to navigational difficulties.
* **C: Dekkal ab jet (Restart a jet)**: While jets (thrusters) are used for attitude control, the focus is on restoring the navigation system, pointing toward the gyroscope issue. Starting a Jet could be a consequence of the gyroscopes having a problem, but the gyroscope is more the source issue
* **D: Jotaat ci doxaliin bu jaar yoon (Return to normal operation)**: This is the *goal*, not the underlying problem causing the deviation.

Therefore, **B: Teye ab gyroscope** most accurately reflects the underlying cause of the space station's navigational problems as described in the passage.
"
"Sunu sukandikoo ci xët bi, lan mo nekkoon jubluwaayu mission wu station spatiale bi?","The correct answer is **D: Dekkal jet yi**.

The passage mentions:

*   ""doxalinam, donte téel na ñakk baldufa ci liggéey bërëb jawwu ji, ba dem ci jawwu di jex"" - something went wrong with the station's movement/orientation.
*   ""doxinu jekkalaatu gindikaay yi"" - issues with the orientation/navigation jets.
*   ""Saytug suufu Risi dekkal na sànni yi gisaat nañu sitiyaasiyon bu normaal bi"" - Russian ground control restored the jets and situation is back to normal.

Therefore, the passage implies that the mission involved ""dekkal jet yi"" (restoring the jets)."

Here's why:

* The passage states that the case originated from ""the home of the Internet service provider AOL"". This implies AOL was the origin or victim of the spam, thus initiating the legal action.
* The other options are incorrect based on the text provided."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban club moo tambaliwul futbal netti pàcc ci ginnaaw?","The correct answer is **C: Barça**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Vidal te mu am 28-at dem na Barça ñetti at ci ginnaaw, jóge Seville"" which translates to ""Vidal at the age of 28 went to Barça three years ago, from Seville.""
* **The question asks:** ""Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban club moo tambaliwul futbal netti pàcc ci ginnaaw?"" which translates to ""Based on the text, which club did he not start playing football three years ago?""

Since he joined Barça three years ago, he did not start playing for Seville, Catalane, or Capital three years ago. However, based on the text, the only club he played for besides Barça is Seville. Therefore the answer is Barcelona."
Ñaata match la Vidal joué ak waa Barça?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The text states: ""Vidal bokk na ci ñent fukk ak juróom ñénti fo ci kureel bi"" which translates to ""Vidal participated in forty-nine matches for the team"".
"
Ban ekip la doon fubalal ci match bi?,"The text states that the team was staying at the hotel before their match against **Bologna**. Therefore, the answer cannot be Bologna because he was getting ready to play *against* them. Jarque was a part of the team that would play against Bologna, so he would be part of the team being prepared to play the game. Since Jarque did not seem to be on the Bologna team, the answer should be **A: Jarque**.
"
Lu tax Jarque nekk ci otel bi?,"The correct answer is **C: Dafa amoon match Dibeer** (He had a Sunday match).

The passage states: ""Mu dëkkoon ci otelu ekip bi laata ab match buñu wara amal bisu Dibeer seen digante ak Boloña."" This translates to ""He was staying in the team hotel before a Sunday match between them and Bologna.""
"
Lu tax këru géophysique bu Jakarta joxewul ab dankaafu?,"The correct answer is **D: Dëppoowul ak càkkutéefi këru magnitude bi ngir yëngu-yëngu suuf yi (It doesn't correspond with the magnitude threshold for earthquakes).**

Here's why:

* The passage states that ""kenn du amal benn àddu ci tsunami ndax jéeya ji (séisme) yeggul ci doole 6.5"" which translates to ""no tsunami warning was issued because the earthquake didn't reach a magnitude of 6.5.""  This means the agency uses a magnitude threshold for issuing tsunami warnings. If the earthquake is below that threshold, no warning is issued. Therefore, the magnitude not being high enough is the reason.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Amul benn fitna wu tsunami (There is no tsunami threat)** This is a restatement of the conclusion, not the *reason* the agency didn't issue a warning.
* **B: Ngir moytu jaxasoo am ci ñi fa dëkkee (To avoid confusion among the inhabitants)** The passage states that people were already worried, so avoiding confusion wasn't the reason for *not* issuing the warning.  The agency made its decision based on scientific data, not public reaction.
* **C: Ngir moytu mu laal kër yi ci dëkk bi (To avoid damage to houses in the city)** Tsunami warnings aren't issued to avoid damage; they're issued to save lives. The passage states there was not even a warning put in place because the magnitude was not strong enough.

Therefore, only D accurately explains why the Jakarta geophysical agency did not issue a tsunami warning, based on the information in the text.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan la yëngu-yëngu suuf si waral?","The correct answer is **D: Ab 6.5 ci eselu magnitude bi** (A 6.5 on the magnitude scale).

The passage states that the earthquake (jéeya ji) did not reach a magnitude of 6.5. Therefore, the earthquake measured 6.5 on the magnitude scale, which is why no tsunami warning was issued.
"
Ban ci yile moo mey waral liggéeyu naaj wi ak yeneen biddeew yi?,"The correct answer is **D: Leeraay, limu Rossby ak wër**

Here's why:

* **P: Danoo gis ne Jànt bi dafay niroog anam ci doxalin sunu ko mengaleek yeneen bideew yi: Yëngu yëngu bideew yi ci sistem bi li ko jiital mooy seeni leeraay, seeni wëndeelu, te du leneen.

Lu limu Rossby geenee tuuti, biddéw bi ak yar ci magnetic melokaan di gnakka yeengu.** This passage states:
    *  Stellar activity is related to their **luminosity (leeraay)** and **rotation (wër/wëndeelu)**.
    *  **Rossby number (limu Rossby)**, calculated using luminosity and rotation, is linked to the stability of the star's magnetic activity.

Therefore, luminosity, Rossby number, and rotation all play a role in stellar activity.
"
Nan lañuy def ngir xam limu Rossby wu benn biddeew?,"The answer is **A: Leeraay ak wërgël**

The passage explicitly states: ""Leeraay ak wëndeelu lañu jëfandikoo ngir xam nimero Rossby bu bideew bu nekk..."" (Brightness and rotation are used to determine the Rossby number of each star...).
"
Ban pursantaasu nit yuñu laaj moo nangu Australie doon ab repubique ci saasi?,"The correct answer is **B: 29 ci téemer bo jël**

The text states: ""Bi wote yi jeexe, 29 ci téémeer dañu xalaat ni Óstraali warna doon republik ci li gaaw"" which translates to ""After the votes ended, 29 percent thought that Australia should become a republic quickly.""
"
"Ci xalaatu Julie Gillard, kañ la Autralie wara doon ab république?","The correct answer is **B: Su nguuru Reine Elisabeth II jeexee** (When Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends).

The text explicitly states that Julia Gillard said she expected Australia to become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
"
Ban bootaay lañu nekk di amal ab atéb yoon?,"The correct answer is **C: Mbirum waajur buñu waajal (Planned Parenthood)**.

The passage states that the Komen Foundation policy change targeted Planned Parenthood because of allegations that Planned Parenthood used funds for abortions. Therefore, Planned Parenthood is the organization being legally scrutinized.
"
Cliff Stearns moo jiite ban comité?,"The correct answer is **D: Comité de surveillance ak lanket**.

The text says: ""Stearns mu ngi ceytu ndax limpo yi jëffandikoo nanu ko ngir fay yàkk njur yi jaare ko ci Planned Parenthood ci ni mu nekkee njiitu Komite bi suuf Xool bi ak Ceytu gi"". ""Komite bi suuf Xool bi ak Ceytu gi"" translates to ""Committee of Oversight and Investigation"", which is what ""Comité de surveillance ak lanket"" refers to.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan moo amul woon ci doomu Swiss bu jigéen bi?","The correct answer is **B: Dañ ko reyoon**.

The passage mentions the woman was robbed, and the thieves were apprehended. There is no mention of her being killed.
"
Ban kër lañu jox Taiwan Sustainable Award ci atum 2007?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The text explicitly states that ASUS was awarded the Taiwan Sustainable Award in 2007.
"

"
Kan moo waraloon wayndare post yi reeroon?,"The correct answer is **C: Ab xale bu góor** (A young boy).

The text states that the post office workers apologized after they found out that a young boy had hidden over 600 postal documents, including 429 New Year's greeting cards that their recipients did not receive. This is the direct cause of the missing mail.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kan moo demoon jeggali ci li àju ci wayndare yi reer?","Correct answer: C
"
Kañ la Del Potro wara wut saafara ci jafe-jafe bi ci mbaggam?,"The correct answer is **C: Laata ñaareelu set bi**.

The text states: ""Bi fa match bi tolloo lañu doon faj mbagu Potro, waaye mujji na yeggali match bi."" This translates to ""It was when the match reached a certain point that they were treating Potro's injury, but he finished the match."" The first set didn't have any mention of Potro's injury, and neither did a tiebreak. It specifically says it happened after the first set because the text states the injury was treated at a certain point in the match and that Del Potro finished the match.
"
Lan mo nekoon resultat wu tie break bu njëkk bi?,"A: Murray moo ko ñakkoon ci set bu njëkk bi.

The passage states that ""Murray ñakk na pacc gu njëkk gi ci benn sanni dong,"" which translates to ""Murray lost the first set in a tiebreak by one point.""
"
"Niñ ko waxee ci xët bi, kan, ci anam bu xejjiku, moo exposé wu ci ab malaat?","The correct answer is **A: Gornoor bi**.

The passage explicitly mentions the ""Gornoor bi"" (Governor) making statements and providing information. The other options are either too broad (Njiiti Texas yi) or not directly associated with the quoted statements (Xale yi, Situwayee yi ci dëkk bi).
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban garanti la gornoor bi joxewul bimuy wax ak doomi réewi Texas yi?","Ci xët bi, gornoor bi wax na ne yoonalin mi ngi def kemtalaayu kàttan ngir àar askan wi, te am nañu ay jumtukaay yu doy ngir def lu kenn deful.

The passage states: ""Bi 11:20 jotee, poliis bi laaj na ñiy ñaxtu ñu dellu ci wetu torotuwaar bi, di xamle ni dañoo soxlawoon peese àqu ñaxtu ak tarafik bi nekkoon di yokk."" This clearly indicates the police asked the protestors to move at 11:20.
"
Lan moo dëggu ci gëstu gi Dr. Ehud Ur def?,"The correct answer is **B: Yenn jinax yu njëkk yi amatu ñu jabet** (Some subjects who previously had diabetes no longer have it).

Here's why:

The passage states:  ""Limu wax mooy, leegi am nañu am jinaxu 4 weer yu musoon am jabet te leegi ama tuñu ko."" This directly translates to: ""The important thing is, we now have subjects (or patients) of 4 months who previously had diabetes and now no longer have it.""

Let's analyze why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Njuréefi yi mên nañu am njariñ ci malaat yi amee jabet type 1 bu sooga feeñ** (The results may be beneficial for children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes): While the research *might* lead to benefits in the future, the passage doesn't explicitly state that this is a confirmed outcome or focus. Dr. Ur is cautioning about over-interpreting the results, especially for type 1 diabetes.
*   **C: Amna yaakaar ni njuréef yi mën nañu doon ab saafara** (There is hope that the results can be a cure): Dr. Ur is cautioning against this. He and other scientists do not believe diabetes can be cured based on this.
*   **D: Yenn jinax yu amul woon jabet dañoo am jabet léegi** (Some subjects who did not have diabetes now have diabetes): This is the opposite of what the passage says.

Therefore, option B is the only one that accurately reflects the information presented in the passage."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ci lan la Dr. Ur am ay sikki sakka?","The correct answer is **A: Ndax njuréef yi am nañu solo ci malaat yu am jabet Type 1**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that Dr. Ur ""waxni geestu yi amugnu solo dara ci nit yi am jabétu Type 1"" which translates to ""said the research is not at all relevant to people with Type 1 diabetes"". This directly addresses the relevance (solo) of the research (njuréef yi) to individuals with Type 1 diabetes (malaat yu am jabet Type 1)."

The text states that the storm is far from landfall (""Ndéémngélaw bi sorina landfull..."") and that it would be difficult to reach the United States or the Caribbean. This is the reason why its future impact is hard to predict.

The passage states ""Yenn njang yi dañ xamle ni feebar dafa wàññi limuy reyaate laata muy waral ab epidemi ci addina bi yépp"" which translates to ""Some studies report that the disease must reduce its mortality rate before it causes a global epidemic.""  Therefore, for the disease to become a pandemic, it needs to become less deadly.

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ci ban digante la soriwaayu Fuji tolloon ak Typhon?","The correct answer is **A: 9 kilomeetar** because the text states the eye of Morakot was *juróom ñaari kilomeetar* (seven kilometers) from Fujian, and the typhoon was moving at *11km/h*. This seems like a trick question, the speed of the typhoon doesn't impact the initial distance. Therefore, neither option is correct. There is a mistranslation in the text above.
"
Kan mo niyu woon George W. Bush bimu dalaloon ci réewum Asie?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng ak Lee Hsien Loong**

The passage says: ""Teewalkat Jëwriñu bu jiitu bu Singapoor mo ko doon nuyu ak waxtaan ci njënd ak njaay ak jafe jafe ci mbooloo yuuy ye fitna ak Lee Hsien Loong Njiitu Jëwriñ ci Singapoor."" This translates to: ""The Senior Minister Mentor of Singapore greeted him and discussed trade and security challenges with Lee Hsien Loong, the Prime Minister of Singapore.""
"
Kañ la njiitu réew mi wax ci wasaaré jënd ak jaay bu Asie?,"The correct answer is **A: Bimu aksee ci Singapore (When he arrived in Singapore)**.

The passage states that ""Ginaaw aybésu làjj ci woote yu diggu nguuram, Bush wax ay nit lu jëm ci yokkute jënd ak jaay ci Asi."" This means ""After being asked questions about the midterm elections, Bush talked to people about increasing trade in Asia."" Since the sentence is right after the one saying he arrived in Singapore, it implies he spoke about Asian trade *after* arriving in Singapore.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët, ban ci yile mooy jubluwaayu mbooleem nguur gi?","The correct answer is **C: Am yeneen 1 300 sareet.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Yeneen 300 dina indi lépp ci 1300 wagon yuñu wara am ngir indi ay saafara ci askan wi nimuy yokkee."" This means the goal is to reach a total of 1300 wagons (or carts/sareet in Wolof) by adding 300 more to the existing number.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Financé ay sareet yu bari fi ak Mars ci at mii:** The passage speaks about increasing the *number* of wagons, but doesn't mention funding being the overall goal. It also doesn't relate to Mars, which is a month.
*   **B: Am lu toll ci 300 sareet:** 300 is the *additional* number of wagons being added, not the overall goal of the government.
*   **D: Waññi feesaayu sareet yi:** The passage indicates a goal of *increasing* the number of wagons, not reducing them."
Lan la nguur gi xamle?,"The correct answer is **C: Dañuy waajal financé yeneen 1 300 sareet**.

Here's why:

*   The text states they will add 300, bringing the total to 1300 wagons. This implies they are preparing to finance (waajal financé) those 1300 wagons.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dañuy waajal financé 300 sareet:** While they are adding 300 wagons, the statement is misleading as the overall point is reaching 1300.
*   **B: Doggu nañu ngir wàññi jafe-jafey feesaayu sareet yi:** The passage talks about adding wagons to bring medicine, not necessarily about reducing issues with the existing wagons.
*   **D: Di nañu indi ay saafara ci jafe-jafe feesaay bi ci weer Màrs:** The passage mentions a meeting in March, but it's not about delivering medicine specifically to address a March issue. The main goal is consistently bringing medicine."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, yan xibaar lañu xam?","Based on P, the correct answer is **A: Dañoo waññi dayoob fitna bi**.

Here's why:

* **P** states: ""...Moonte tëkku gi wàññi na ci tolluwaay bu garaw tekkiwul tëkku gi yepp dem na."" This directly translates to something like, ""Even though the tensions have decreased to a serious level, it doesn't mean all the tension is gone.""  Therefore, the *intensity* of the problem has lessened.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Amatul benn fitna** (There is no problem anymore) - P explicitly says the problem hasn't completely disappeared (""...tekkiwul tëkku gi yepp dem na."").
* **C: Ñoo ngi xaarandi ab cong** (We are expecting a conflict) - P says, ""Amul benn xibaar buy waxni amna ñuy waaja amal am cong."" This means ""There is no information indicating an impending conflict.""
* **D: Service de renseignement yi weral nañu ni cong bi dina metti** (Intelligence services have confirmed the conflict will be severe) - This contradicts P, which says there's no information about an impending conflict.

Therefore, A is the only option that aligns with the information provided in statement P.
"
Ban ci yile wax yu àju ci ñaxtu gi mo nekkul dëgg?,"The correct answer is **D: Wey-fippu yi dañu daan nekk ñu voilent yenn saay.**

Here's why:

* **P states that the Commission was at Martelly's response to quell the complaints which weren't aligned with the government.** This aligns with option A and so is true.
* **P mentions that most of the complaints/turmoil are coming from problems with the election dating back to 2011.**  This means issues with past elections were a cause, making option B true.
* **P mentions that the previous council was asked to give up it's place.** This aligns with option C and is also true.
* **P does not state that the dissidents were violent** making option D false.

Therefore, D is the statement that is NOT supported by the passage.
"
Kan moo digle woon CEP bu yagg bi tekki ndombol takkam?,"The correct answer is **C: Commission wu njiitu réew mi (A committee affiliated with the government)**.

The text states ""Weer wii weesu ab kureel gu bokk ci nguur gi diggle na bàyyi CEP gu njëkk gi..."" which translates to ""Last month a committee affiliated with the government ordered the previous CEP to step down...""
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci wax jii, lan la Gymnastic bu USA jiitewul bi Nassar teggee athlètes yi jëf yu ñaaw?","Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **C: Coppite yu am solo ci biir mbootaay bi**.

The passage states that USA Gymnastics acknowledges the need for significant changes within the organization to prevent future abuse. This implies that the lack of such changes was a contributing factor to the abuse perpetrated by Nassar. While the other options might be related in some way, they are not the primary focus of the passage in relation to preventing future abuse.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci wax ji, lan mooy jubluwaay bu ëpp solo ci USA Gymnastic ak United States Olympic Committee yuy jëm kanam?","The correct answer is **D: Dooleel ab barab bu wóor ngir athlètes yi (Strengthen a safe place for athletes)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""USA Gymnastics dafay dooleel bataaxalu Comité olympique américain ba noppi nangu bëgg-bëggu njabootu waa olympique ngir amal tàggat gi ci anam yu am kaaraange ndax musal athlete yi ci loraange."" (USA Gymnastics is strengthening the American Olympic Committee's charter and accepting the Olympic family's desire to conduct training safely to protect athletes from harm).  This directly supports creating a safe environment.
* The passage also says:""Gimnastik bu Amerig ak USOC ñoo bokk jubluwaay — fexe ba gimnastik ak yeneen xeeti tàggat yaram wóor ngir jongantekat yi topp seeni mbëbët ci nekkin bu baax te am doole"" (American Gymnastics and USOC share the goal - to make gymnastics and other sports safe so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a good and strong environment).
"

"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci wax jii, ban réew moo nango yore xeexkat yuñu japp?","The correct answer is **D: Turquie**.

The text states that Turkey will be involved in overseeing ISIS soldiers, implying they are taking responsibility for them. It also explicitly says European countries refused to have them returned.
"
Lan lañu jàpp ni mo waral roplaan bi daanu?,"Correct answer: **B: Lakk yu tar**

Explanation: The passage states ""Jéyyee ji aména ci fu beeri ay janj, té geem nagnu ni mongi bayyéko ci ak safara"" which translates to ""The crash had many signs of fire, and it is believed to have been caused by fire"". This directly indicates that fire (lakk yu tar) is believed to be the cause of the crash."
Ci ban xeetu barab la roplaan bi daanoo?,"D: Bari montaañ 

Here's why:

* The passage states ""Jéyyee ji aména ci fu beeri ay janj"" which translates to ""The crash happened in a place with many mountains."" This directly indicates a mountainous region.
"
Lan la njiit yi yaakaar bi mbënd mi amee?,"The correct answer is **A: Defaraat baŋu suuf yi** (Restoration of the sandbanks).

The text states: ""njiit yi yaakaar nanu ne dina doy ngir deloosi bangu suuf yu yàkku yu nekk ci fi ndox mi d wàccee"" which translates to ""the leaders hope that it will be enough to restore the damaged sandbanks located where the water recedes.""
"
Yan ci yile la tabaxum baraas bi laal ci anam guy sax?,"The correct answer is **C: Dëkkuwaayu njanaaw yi** (Habitats of fish).

Here's why:

*   The passage directly states that the sediment was important for creating banks and shorelines that served as habitats for fish. The passage also notes that two species of fish disappeared and two others are near extinction as a result of the dam. This shows that the habitat of the fish will be affected long after the dam is erected.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Baaru suuf yi (The banks of the soil):** The soil banks were damaged, but the passage hopes the dam will eventually help restore them. Therefore, it is not a permanent effect.
*   **B: Chevesnes à bosse:** This is meaningless in the context and is not present in the text.
*   **D: Wasaare sediment yi (Sediment distribution):** While the dam impacted sediment distribution, the *effect* on the fish habitat is the lasting consequence mentioned most prominently."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kan mo jox Etats-Unis ay xibaar ci ay cong yu bari?","The correct answer is **C: Ab ccostéef buñu nëbb**.

The text says ""Waa États-Unis neena ñu am nañu xibaar yu leer yuñ dul joxe seeni tur..."" which translates to ""The United States said they have clear information from unnamed sources..."". ""Yuñ dul joxe seeni tur"" means unnamed sources.  ""Ab ccostéef buñu nëbb"" means an unnamed source. Therefore, that's the answer that fits the description in the text.
"
Ban ci yile wax mooy xamle bu baax congum extrémistes yuñu njort?,"The best answer is **C: Kalaatel ay bomb ca ay barab yuñu tànn ci ñaari réew**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions attacks in both Kenya and Ethiopia (""Keeñaa ak Ecoopi"").
*   It specifies that these attacks target ""monument yu am solo"" (important monuments), implying specific, selected locations, not just any random place.

Therefore, option C accurately captures both the location (two countries) and the targeted nature (specific places) of the extremist threat."
Ban ci yile nit ñoo nekkul ab awokaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Makis Triantafylopoulos**.

Here's why:

*   **Makis Triantafylopoulos** is described as a ""tasakatu xibaar"" which translates to ""journalist"". All the other options are either attorneys or avocets."
Ban gurubu nit lañu limul niki lu bokk ci eskandal bi ci biir askanu yoonu Gerek?,"Désignation de la réponse: A, B et D

Ñaata guichets la Ind ñakk?,"Based on the text, the correct answer is **B: 7**

The text states: ""Wante, bamu ñàkkee kirie bu kapiten bi ba léegi India 36 ponc ñàkk juróom ñaari kirike ngir jeexal mans yi."" which translates to: ""However, since the captain's wicket was lost, India lost 7 wickets for 36 points to finish the innings.""

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan lañu dindi ci dal bi?","The correct answer is **C: Ab porose polotik (A political plot)**.

The passage states ""Merug askan wi moo waral ñuy jéema bind ab polotik bu mengook këmb yuy wone awra bu daluweb..."" which translates to ""National anger is why they are trying to construct a political plot in line with [something about website aura]"". Therefore, a political plot is being removed.

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile la Amir Khan di jiite donte daf ci am xalaatu boppam?","The correct answer is **C: Jeux Olympiques yu 2012**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Amir Khan will support the England competitors in the Olympics taking place in London. The London Olympics took place in 2012.
"
Kan la Peter Lenz faatu?,"The correct answer is **C: Ca lopitaal ba** (At the hospital).

The text says ""ñu toxal ko ci beneen lopitaal bimu mujj fatoo"" which translates to ""they transported him to another hospital where he eventually died.""
"
Kan mooy Xavier Zayat?,"The correct answer is **B: Beneen rawantekat**.

The passage states: ""moroomam Xavier Zayat mu nekkoon ci beneen welo"" which translates to ""his competitor Xavier Zayat who was on another motorcycle"". This indicates that Xavier Zayat is another racer (rawantekat).
"
Ci ban anam la ab dawalkatu roplaan bu mér di am interêt xam ni roplaan di doxee?,"The correct answer is **B: Sudee seen bañug roplaan mu ngi bawoo ci ragalug luñu xamul (If their fear of planes stems from a fear of the unknown)**

Here's why:

The passage in P says that understanding how a plane works can help people who are afraid of flying due to a lack of knowledge or lack of control.  Option B directly addresses this point by stating that if the fear comes from the unknown, understanding how planes work would be beneficial. The other options don't directly address the core issue of fear stemming from a lack of understanding.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile la ab wey-tukki buy xalaat wara mujjee def?","The correct answer is **C: Mengaleel njëg yi am ci digante ay kër yuy yëngu ci njaayum tiketu tukki.**

Here's why:

The passage says ""Yenn saay benn wol bi mën naa am ay njëg yu wuute ci ay agregateur yu bari te li ci gën mooy méngale njuréefi gëstu yi te xool itam daluwebu compañi ayeriyen bi ci bopp laata ngay def sa reservation."" This translates to ""Sometimes the same flight can have different prices on different aggregators and the best thing is to compare the search results and also check the airline's website itself before making your reservation.""

Option C, ""Mengaleel njëg yi am ci digante ay kër yuy yëngu ci njaayum tiketu tukki"" (Compare the prices available between travel agencies/ticket aggregators), directly reflects this advice. While checking the airline's website (Option D) is also mentioned, comparing prices from different sources first is highlighted as the initial step.

Therefore, C is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan la wey-tukki yi wara njëkka def ngir àar njëgi tiketu tiket yi gëna yomb?","The correct answer is **B: Mengalel njëg yi digante ay aggrégateurs yu bari.**

The passage explicitly states ""...benn wol bi mën naa am ay njëg yu wuute ci ay agregateur yu bari..."" which translates to ""one flight can have different prices on multiple aggregators.""  Therefore, comparing prices across different aggregators is a key step.
"
Kañ lañuy sakku ci ab kër mu guŋgee ab livraison?,"The correct answer is **A: Suñu yonnee ay mbir ci ab fret**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the problems of sending goods as freight.** It discusses delays in customs, difficulties for smaller companies that don't have their own aircraft, and the problems of sending goods as unaccompanied baggage.  These are all issues related to freight shipping.
* **The passage explicitly mentions shipping things by air freight.** This strongly implies that needing assistance would be common when shipping via freight.

The other options are less directly supported by the text:

* **B: Su kër gi nekkee di jëfandikoo ay roplaan:** The passage mentions large companies having their own planes, but it doesn't imply this is a reason *to need help*. In fact, it might suggest the opposite.
* **C: Suñuy yónnee ay mbir niki ay bagaas yuñu enregistré:** The passage *discourages* sending items as unaccompanied baggage and says they don't accept such shipments.
* **D: Su ab kër bu gëna mag nekkee di toppatoo livraison bi:** The passage contrasts large companies with small companies, suggesting it's the *smaller* companies that need more help because they don't have their own planes.

Therefore, option A directly addresses the core problem the passage discusses – the challenges of shipping goods as freight.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, sooy tànn ak kêru jaay tiket Frequent Flye ci ab alliance, ban ci yile lañu wara gëna jox gëdd?","The correct answer is **C: Këru njaayum tiket bi ngay gëna jëfandikoo ngir tukki**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes choosing a frequent flyer program strategically based on your *actual* travel habits.**  It suggests not just going for the program that *seems* to offer the most benefits on paper, but considering where you *actually* fly the most. Therefore, choosing the program of the airline you use the most (or an airline within their alliance that serves your common destinations) makes the most sense.

Let's look at why the other options are less ideal:

*   **A: Këru njaayum tiket buy joxe poñ yu gëna bari:** While accumulating points is good, the passage warns against solely focusing on this if the airline doesn't align with your travel patterns.
*   **B: Këru njaayum tiket ci alliance bu gëna mag:** A larger alliance *can* offer more destination options, but it's irrelevant if you don't fly to those destinations.
*   **D: Kër gi wara yokk yeneen xeeti baax-baax:** While added benefits are nice, it's most efficient to use the company that you will use the most for travel.

**In summary, the key is to align your frequent flyer program with your *actual* travel habits, making option C the best choice.**
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kan moo wara joxe ay poñi tukki yu gëna bari?","The correct answer is **B: Sa këru njaayum tiket bi ngay gëna dem ci kaadaru mennum alliance bi**.

Here's why:

The text in P suggests that you should choose a frequent flyer program carefully, considering the benefits and where you travel most often. The key idea is to maximize your points based on your travel habits.  Therefore, you'll earn more points by sticking with the frequent flyer program of the airline alliance you most frequently use.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ci yëg-yëg wuute yi, ban ci yile lañu mëna dankaafu ci ab jëfandikoo sangara bu ëpp?","The text says ""Xew-xewi wergu-yaram yu yagg yi bawoo jëfandikoo sangara bu bari te mën naa waral ay jafe-jafe ba ci **gumba** ak faatu.""  Gumba means blindness. Blindness affects the sense of sight.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Gis-gis** (Sight).
"
"Niñ ko waxee ci xët bi, lan moo wara mëna wàññi mbir yiy gaañe ci sangara?","The correct answer is **C: Jëfandikoo sangara ci anam gu andak dal** (Use alcohol in moderation).

Here's why:

* **P** states ""Ku nekk nila sàngara di def bokkul ak ni muy def keneen, kon xam fi ngay yam amna solo"" which translates to ""Everyone reacts differently to alcohol, so knowing your limit is important."" This directly supports using alcohol in moderation.  It also warns against ""jëfandikoo sangara bu bari"" which translates to ""using alcohol excessively"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jëfandikoo sangara bu am methanol** (Use alcohol with methanol): The passage explicitly warns about the dangers of illegally produced alcohol, which can contain harmful substances like methanol.
* **B: Naan ay sangara yuñu defareewul ci anam bu yoon nanguwul** (Drink alcohol that is not legally produced): The passage explicitly warns against consuming illegally produced alcohol.
* **D: Naan ak ay nit yu bari** (Drink with many people): The passage doesn't mention drinking with many people as a way to reduce harm.  The focus is on the individual's consumption and the safety of the alcohol itself.
"
Fan la njëgi dëkkuwaay yi gëna seer ci Amsterdan?,"The answer is **A: Canal District**.

The first sentence of the passage states that the Canal District (Goxu kanaal yi) is a famous area. The question asks where housing prices are highest in Amsterdam. Since the passage highlights the Canal District as a well-known and significant area, it's a logical assumption that housing prices there would be high. The passage connects to this by mentioning it's a UNESCO world heritage site, meaning it's valuable.
"
Lu tax ñu tànn Canal District niki ab Barabu Ndonol UNESCO?,"The correct answer is **A: Solos dembam ak cosaanam (Solos dembam ak cosaanam)** which translates to ""Its cultural and historical significance.""

The original text says: ""...defnagnuko ni Ndonol UNESCO ngir njeeg gimu am ci aada ak taarix..."" which directly translates to ""...it was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its cultural and historical value...""

While the other options are true statements (it does surround Binnenstad, it is valuable), the *reason* it was chosen is directly linked to its cultural and historical importance.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ci yile wax, ban moo ci tax Phnom Krom nekk lu jara dem wisit?","The correct answer is **A: Gisiin ci Tonle Sap** and **D: Tukkib bato ci jaare ko ci déeg bi**.

Here's why:

*   The text mentions that ""gissin ci déex Tonle Sap tax na yegg cikaw montañ jar ko."" (view of the Tonle Sap makes climbing the mountain worthwhile).

*   The text also mentions that ""Ab wër ci bërëb ba, mënees na ko booleek ab tukki ci gaal ci dex ga."" (A visit to the site can be combined with a boat trip on the river).

*   Options B and C are incorrect because although Angkor Pass is mentioned as a requirement, the text mentions visiting Tonle Sap rather than Angkor Pass to obtain it. Siem Reap is not a reason to visit Phnom Krom but simply where it's located."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan lañu soxla ci visiteur yi ngir ñu mën dem Phnom Krom?","The correct answer is **C: Am Angkor Pass**.

The text states: ""Fàww nga am cole d'Angkor ngir mëna dugg ci barabu jaamukaay bi..."" which translates to ""You must have an Angkor Pass in order to enter the temple...""
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile mooy mëna tere ab touriste mu dem Antarctique?","According to the text, tourism to Antarctica is expensive and difficult. Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: Ab budget tukki bu am solo (A significant travel budget)** - The text states that tourism is expensive (""seer""), so a significant travel budget *is* a barrier.

*   **B: Benn interé wu dem ci Ross Sea (No interest in visiting Ross Sea)** - The text mentions that tours are usually limited to the Ross Sea, but a lack of interest in visiting it doesn't *prevent* someone from going to Antarctica (they might still want to visit other parts, though harder to get to).

*   **C: Ab waxtu liggéey bu tax nga mën tukki ci Desambar ak Samwiyee (A work schedule that prevents travel in December and January)** - The text states the tourist season is only from November to February (été). Therefore, if someone can't travel during that time, it *would* prevent them from going.

*   **D: Mëna dem ak dikk bu yem (The ability to travel round trip)** - This doesn't apply at all as it is expected that tourists will be able to get to and from the location.

Between A and C, C is a more direct and absolute barrier. If you *can't* travel during the short summer season, you can't go at all. While A is a barrier, people with lower budgets might still find cheaper ways to visit.

Therefore, the best answer is **C**."
Ab touriste bu bëgg yégg ci ay montaañ fan la wara dem ci Antarctique?,"The correct answer is **C: Péninsule bi**

**Reason:**

The passage states, ""Yenn nit yu xarañ ci wallum tur yu roplaan yi di def dañuy dem ci biir dëkk yi, ngir defi ay alpinism wala agg ci Pole bi, bi am baaz bu mag."" 

While the specific location of mountains isn't directly stated, the context implies that tourists interested in alpinism (mountain climbing) would likely be going to the ""biir dëkk yi"" using air tours. While other options like Ross Sea or the Islands could be part of the Antarctic trip, The sentence is implying that tourists in air tours are going to the continent not Ross sea or the islands, but to the peninsula since is more specific when we talk about continent, and the sentence doesn't mention the Ross sea.
"
Fan la ab saytu bu bokkagul ci yu bees yi moo nekkul lu yomb xam fimu nekk?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: Ci ab barab bu sori**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that modern telescopes are placed ""ci beereeb lagnu ak ay mbiiru aalam yu ci wééru"" which translates to ""remote places and international issues that concern it"". This implies older, non-modern telescopes would not be located in those remote locations and international issues.

Therefore, a non-modern telescope would likely *not* be in a remote location.
"
Fan lañu wara heberger ab telescope gëstu bu bees?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Ci ab campus université**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that old observatories used to be near places like schools.
*   It also states that current observatories are often found in cities or on university campuses.

The passage doesn't mention museums or large workplaces in the context of modern telescope placement.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban barab moo wara doon fi gën ngir dem ci tefes bi?","Based on the provided text:

*   The text describes the Tamaki Drive beaches in Waitemata Harbour (including Mission Bay and St Heliers) as sometimes crowded with many boutiques.
*   The North Harbour beaches are described as accessible for swimming, and primarily shaded by pohutukawa trees.
    Therefore, there is no information that one is a superior destination to the other.

However, options A and B (St Heliers and Mission Bay) are specifically identified as popular beach destinations. It is difficult to choose between them without more information, but since ""crowded"" is mentioned, the best answer might be option C (The North Harbour District) since those beaches are not specifically called out for being crowded.

Therefore, the answer is C."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, fan moo gëna woor ngir dem sangu fa?","The text states that the beaches in Tamaki Drive (Central Auckland) are often crowded and have many boutiques along the shore, but that ""feey fii wóor na."" This means the **tidal activity is safe.** The other options are geographical locations that have beaches. Therefore, the best answer based on the provided text is:

**C: Central Auckland**
"
"Sooy dem ci barab buñu xamle ci xët bi, ban ci mbir yii ñoo andul ak loolu?","The correct answer is **A: Jëfee ci anam bu jekk**.

Here's why:

* **P (the text)** is asking people to treat the place with dignity and respect, and to avoid actions that dishonor the memory of those who suffered there (avoiding jokes about the Holocaust/Nazis, preventing graffiti, etc.)

* **Q (the question)** asks which action *goes against* this request for respect.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Jëfee ci anam bu jekk (Acting normally/casual):** This could imply not taking the place seriously, and is contrary to the request for dignity and respect.

*   **B: Bayyi ab mandarga fenn ci barab bi (Leaving a mark on the place):** This is similar to graffiti and is explicitly forbidden in the text.

*   **C: Wax / def ay mbir yu reelu (Saying/doing disrespectful things):** This directly contradicts the plea to avoid jokes about the Holocaust/Nazis and treat the place with dignity.

*   **D: Xoos ab banqaas (Stealing something):** Stealing from the premises is disrespectful and dishonors the site.

While B, C, and D are all explicitly disrespectful, **A** is the most likely to be considered as going against the request for dignity and respect. Acting ""normally"" or ""casual"" in a place of remembrance implies a lack of understanding of its solemnity. Thus, **A** is the most suitable answer."
Ban ci yile mooy xamle luy lakku lingua francas?,"The correct answer is **D: Luy dundu (Luy dundu - Something that lives/is living)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that lingua francas are *natural* or *organic* languages. ""Luy dundu"" implies something that is alive and evolving naturally.
*   Options A, B, and C (""Luñu sos,"" ""Lu natirelul,"" ""Luñu tabax"") all describe artificial or constructed things, which are the *opposite* of the description of lingua francas in the passage."
Ban wax moo dul xamle ci anam gu leer lakki jappandal yi?,"The best answer is **C: Ay lakk lañu yuñu tabax ngir yombal ay jokkoo yu jafe**.

Here's why:

* **C** directly reflects the definition given in the passage: that constructed languages are created to facilitate communication in situations where communication is difficult.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ay lakk yuy dundu lañu yuñu jëfandikoo ngir yombal jokkoo gi am digante nit ñi nga xamne mën nañu baña xam luñuy waxante:** This is incorrect because constructed languages are not always ""living"" languages in the sense that they evolve and are organically adopted by a community.  While some *become* more widely used, the passage emphasizes their *intended* purpose.
* **B: Ay lakk lañu yi nga xamantane dañoo natirel te ñu tabax leen:** This is a contradiction. Constructed languages are, by definition, not natural.
* **D: Ay lakk yuñu sos lañu yu gënante ci digante ñi koy lakk:** While there might be debate among speakers, the passage focuses on the languages' *purpose* (to facilitate communication) and *origin* (artificial construction) rather than potential conflict among users.

Therefore, **C** is the most accurate and directly reflects the meaning of the provided text.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan la kiliyaan wara xool sudee seen croisière ci été bi laè koy amal?","The correct answer is **A: Barab bi cabin bi nekk**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Su ngeen di romb bëj gànaaru Baltique ci jamonoy sedd, xool leen bu baax fu cabine bi nekk..."" which translates to ""If you are cruising the Baltic Sea in cold weather, pay close attention to where the cabin is located...""  This directly addresses the location of the cabin. The rest of the sentences are related to cruises that are *not* in the summer.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, su ab kiliyaan defee ab croisière ci été bi, lan lañu wara mëna moytu?","The passage (P) states that during a cold-weather Baltic cruise, one should be careful of the cabin location because walking on ice is very noisy, especially for those most affected by it.  It also mentions that cruises from Saint Petersburg include time in the city and that cruise passengers generally don't need visas (subject to specific conditions).

The question (Q) asks what a customer can *avoid* when taking a cruise in the *summer*.

* **A: Diir buñuy nekk ci dëkk bi (Time spent in the city):** This is part of the cruise, whether summer or winter, so you can't *avoid* it.
* **B: Dem ci galaas gi (Walking on ice):** The passage explicitly mentions ice as a concern during *cold* weather cruises.  Therefore, in the *summer*, you can avoid walking on ice.
* **C: Càkkutéefu Visa (Visa issues):** The passage says that cruise passengers often don't need visas, so it's unlikely to be a significant issue to be avoided.
* **D: Saint Petersburg:** Saint Petersburg is the destination. You can't avoid the destination if you are on the cruise.

Therefore, the best answer is **B: Dem ci galaas gi (Walking on ice)**.
"
Lu tax ñuy jëfandikoo lakku Catalan lu bari ngir ay mandarga ak ay yëgle ci Barcelone?,"The correct answer is **B: Mooy lakk bi gëna officielle ci dëkk bi (It is the most official language in the city)**.

The text states that signs are often in Catalan because the law dictates it as the working language of the region. This directly supports the idea of Catalan being the official language.
"
Ban ci lakk yii lañuy sistemu Barcelone di gëna jëfandikoo ngir ay yëgle yu bari?,"The correct answer is **B: Catalane**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""barina signe yoo xam ni ci catalan lañu leen amalee ndax yoon dafa wax ni mooy làkku liggéey ci réew mi"" which translates to ""there are many signs that are in Catalan because the law says it is the language of work in the country."" This implies a significant presence of Catalan in official signage and communication.
* While Spanish is widely understood, the passage highlights Catalan's legal status and its use in many signs, indicating its prominence in the public sphere in Barcelona.

Here's why:

*   The text states ""Yeneen xew-xew Ski dina ñu am ci barab ski bu Taizicheng ci Zhangjiakou..."" which means Taizicheng ski events will be in Zhangjiakou, not Beijing.
*   The text says that Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies, and also indoor ice competitions.

Therefore, Beijing is NOT in charge of the ski events in Taizicheng."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile la Pékin di jiite ci atum 2022?","The correct answer is **B: Xew-xewi galaas yuy am ci biir barab yi** and **D: Cérémonies de clôture yi**.

The text explicitly states that Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies, and also the indoor ice events. Option B is the best fit from the provided answers.
"
Kan moo gëna yomba am feebaru grippe aviaire?,"The correct answer is **C: Ñiy liggéey ci njanaw yi** (Those who work with poultry).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Lu ëpp ci ñoom dafa laal ñiy yëngu ci yarum ginaar waaye itam mën na laalaate ñi yëngu ci wàllu yarum picc.""  This translates to ""Most of them affect those who work in chicken farming, but it can also affect those who work in poultry farming.""  Since working with poultry is more general than just chickens, it's the best answer.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile wax mooy xamle bu baax luy grippe aviaire?","The correct answer is **C: Ñiy toppatoo njanaaw yi ñoo ngi ci risku am feebar bi** (Those who care for chickens are at risk of getting the disease).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that avian influenza affects birds and mammals, and it especially affects those involved in raising chickens and other birds. This directly implies that people involved in poultry farming are at higher risk.
The other options are incorrect based on the provided passage:

*   **A: Ñiy liggéey ci njanaaw yi kese ñoo am grippe bi** (Only those who work with chickens get the flu): The passage states that it can affect those involved in raising other birds as well.
*   **B: Ay kaa yu bari lañu gis ci nit ñi ak ci njanaaw yi** (Many cases have been seen in humans and chickens): The passage states that mutations occur. The passage doesn't indicate frequency in humans, but just the opposite
*   **D: Kaa yuñu xamle ci nit ñi yépp dañuy rayaate** (All cases identified in humans are fatal): The passage doesn't mention fatality rates.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate statement based on the information given."
Lan la kanaalu White Sea–Baltic Canal di boole?,"The correct answer is **C: Arctic Ocean ak Baltic Sea**.

The passage states directly: ""White Sea-Baltic Canal dafay lëkkale Arctic Ocean ak Baltic Sea..."" (White Sea-Baltic Canal connects Arctic Ocean and Baltic Sea...).

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ci ban xeetu ndamaar lañu wara jëlee ay passport ngir baña teye kiliyaan yi?","The correct answer is **B: Otoraayi guddi yi**.

The text specifically states that ""Ci saxaaru guddi yi ñuy nelaw, dawalkat bi mën na dajale paaspoor yi ba nga xam ne nelaw yi du yàkku."" (In night buses where people sleep, the driver can collect passports so sleep isn't disturbed).
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lañuy saytuwaat sa dantite ci yenn otoraay yuy jeggi foroñceer?","The correct answer is **D: Su otoraay bi nekkee di daw** because the prompt says: ""Ci yen jàllukaay diggante dëkk ak dëkk danuy set saxaa yi nekk di daw te da nga wara yor dentite bu baax sooy dug ci saxaar yooyule"" meaning that in some vehicles between cities, they check the identities while the vehicles are in motion."

It also mentions ""Alëma yu bari défar nañu yu bari ak ay gnam yu wuté, ak yénéni garabu gérté."" (Many almonds are used to make many different snacks and other nuts).

While plums and almonds are mentioned, apples are specifically said to be used in pastries *all year round*. Therefore, the best answer is A.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile moo warul doon luñuy digle ngir tukki ci ab budget?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is:

**C: Laaj nit ñi xaalis (Asking people for money)**

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes managing expenses and avoiding unethical or illegal activities. Asking people for money during your travels, especially if it borders on begging or taking advantage, can easily fall into those categories. The passage strictly warns against theft, getting involved in illegal or unclear transactions, and deceiving or harming others.
*   **A: Wut ay liggéey yu ndaw yooy def sooy tukki (Finding small jobs to do while traveling)** - This is the ALTERNATIVE approach mentioned initially (working while traveling), and the article focuses on the OTHER approach, which is cutting expenses. It's not a direct instruction *against* something.
*   **B: Nekk ku feex ak sa dayoob confort (Be comfortable with your level of comfort)** - The passage is all about budgeting. Being comfortable with a lower level of comfort aligns with reducing expenses.
*   **D: Waññi xaalis bi ngay def ci lu melni lekk wala dëkkuwaay (Reduce the money you spend on things like food or lodging)** - This is a direct strategy for traveling on a budget."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kan moo wara am jafe-jafey tukki ak budget bu ndaw?","The correct answer is **A: Kenn kuy nangu jaŋkoonteeg ab jafe-jafe**.

Here's why:

*   The passage focuses on people who want to travel with a small budget.
*   It suggests they reduce expenses to travel with little money, meaning they may face difficulties due to lack of resources.
*   Therefore, someone who wants to face the challenge (nangu jaŋkoonteeg ab jafe-jafe) of traveling with a small budget would fit.

The other options don't directly align with the passage's emphasis on budget constraints:

*   B: The passage focuses on budget, not time constraints.
*   C: The passage explicitly states the article does NOT focus on working remotely while traveling.
*   D: It doesn't specifically mention whether those who want to travel are those who want to follow a path."
Ban ci yile wax moo du xamle ci anam bu leer digante bi nekk Point Marion ak Fairmont ?,"The best answer is **B: Yoon yi dañoo sew** (The roads are narrow).

Here's why:

*   The passage directly mentions ""yoon yu sew"" (narrow roads) as a characteristic of the road between Point Marion and Fairmont.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Am na ay yoon yu guddu yu ay àll yu sori** (There are long roads in remote areas) While the passage mentions taking detours through side roads, it doesn't emphasize the *length* of the detour or that it's only in remote area.
*   **C: Lu neew lañuy nangoo topp yemale gaawaay yi** (Speed limits are rarely followed) The passage says speed limits are low, but it implies compliance is important.
*   **D: Sàrwiisi telefon portaabal yi waru ñu nekk ab jafe-jafe** (Mobile phone service should not be a problem) The opposite is indicated. Mobile service is mentioned because it *is* surprisingly good in this area compared to others."

"
Ban ci yile lañu soxlawul ngir tambali ab canyoning ?,"The correct answer is **B: Anami yaram yu ñoŋ**.

Here's why:

*   **P states:** Canyoning ""laaj na tuuti tàggatu wala nekkin bu baax ci yaram ngir tàmbali"" which translates to ""requires a little training or good physical condition to start"". So, while it requires some fitness, it doesn't necessarily mean needing very high (ñoŋ) fitness from the get go.
*   **A, C and D** are directly related to the activities (féey and tëb) and the need for training mentioned in P

Therefore, being in very high physical condition is not necessarily required to start canyoning, just some basic fitness level.
"
Ban ci yile lañuy soxla ngir am ab génnug canyoning bu am ndam?,"D: Man-manu feey

Explanation:

The text says that canyoning involves parts of ""féey"" (sliding/gliding/descending) and while it needs some fitness, it's not as demanding as other activities like mountaineering, scuba diving, or alpine skiing.  Therefore, the ability to descend (feey) is the most directly relevant skill mentioned.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan mooy am solo ci kenn mu xalaata camper ci ab ndamaaram?","The correct answer is **B: Ab ndamaar buy mey siis bi tëdd**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Daamaru kër mën na nékk bo amé minivan bu makk, SUV, Sedan wala Station Wagon ak ay toogu yuy tëdd."" (A home camper can be made if you have a large minivan, SUV, Sedan or Station Wagon *with seats that fold down*.) This emphasizes the importance of having seats that can lie flat for sleeping arrangements.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Ab nandite gu mag ci yemaley sa ndamaar** The text only mentions having a big car; no mention of needing a *big profit to pay for your camper*.
*   **C: Ab tant** While a tent might be used in addition, the core concept in the text is converting your vehicle into a sleeping space, which replaces the need for a tent.
*   **D: Ab moomeel bu jamburé ngir camper** The text mentions that owning a trailer can make camping easier, but not that it is required.

Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan la ñiy camper ci woto yi bëgg a moytu suñuy jéema nekk ci suuf radar bi?","The correct answer is **C: Defar ab tant ci dëkk vi wala ab moomeel bu jamburé**.

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Samp xayma ci moomelu jaamur wala ci gox bumu mëna don mën na yombal artu buñu sopul."" This translates to ""Setting up camp on private property or in a remote area can make unwanted attention easier to avoid.""
*   The question asks what car campers want to avoid when trying to stay ""under the radar.""

Options A, B, and D are not directly related to avoiding attention while camping in a car, according to the text."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët, kan tabaxaat Casablanca ci ñaareelu yoon bi?","The correct answer is **D: Sultan bu Maroc**.

The passage states: ""Sultan bu Marok dafa defaraat dëkk bi ne Daru l- Badya..."" which translates to ""The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city, renaming it Daru l- Badya...""
"
Kan moo daw génn ci gëkku Casablanca bi ab musiba baba kumba amee?,"The correct answer is **B: Portugais yi**.

The passage states that the Portuguese destroyed Casablanca and rebuilt it as Casaa Branca, but then *left* after an earthquake in 1755. This implies they withdrew from the city due to the disaster.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, nan la Sintra def ba waa bitim-réew raññee ko?","The correct answer is **C: Addu yu baax yu Lord Byron.**

The passage states that Sintra is famous ""ginaaw nettali bu mucc ayub bu neexaayam te Lord Byron"" which translates to ""after the wonderful tales of its beauty by Lord Byron."" This indicates that Lord Byron's positive descriptions contributed to Sintra's fame.
"
Lan la Armenie nangu wul?,"The correct answer is **D: Repiblik bu bees bi**.

The text states that ""amul menn réew mu ko nangu, ba ci Armenie mi ko jàppale"" which means even Armenia doesn't recognize the new republic.
"
Lan moo wey di indi ay lorange ci lëkkëloo yi am digante Azerbaijan ak Arménie?,"The correct answer is **D: Diiwaanu Nagorno-Karabakh**.

The passage states that the Nagorno-Karabakh region is the root of the conflict and that negotiations related to it continue to cause problems between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
"
"Sooy jël ab taxi ci Charlotte, lan mooy mêna waral nga feyaat leneen?","Jawabu bi mooy **B: Am ñetti kiliyaan**.

"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan nañu mëna jàppee niki lu neexul ci dëkk Charlotte ak ay xale?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: Jël ab taxi**.

The text mentions that ""Taksi njabooti Charlotte bariwul li nu kay jëfandikoo, doonte mën nanu am njariñ ci yenn toluwaay yi."" This indicates that taking a taxi in Charlotte is not as readily used/convenient and potentially more expensive (""tànnéef bi mën naa gëna seer limuy laaj"") compared to the value it provides.  Therefore, the text suggests that taxis are not necessarily a family-friendly aspect of living in Charlotte.
"
"Laata Espagnol yi di aksi, kan moo jiite woon xaaj bi feete kaw ci Chili?","The correct answer is **D: Incas yi**.

The text states ""Laata wa Ispaañ di ñëw ci 16eelu xarnu bi, bëj-gànnaaru Ciili nekkonna ci momeelu Inca si..."". This translates to ""Before the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, the northern part of Chile was under the control of the Incas...""
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile moo xewul woon ci atum 1810?","Jebal yi ci jub dem ci bu yees:

Nan la nit ñi mënaa àgg ci wilaas yu sori ci diiwaanu Liguria?,"Based on the passage:

*   The passage states: ""Yoon yi, otoraay ak bato yi dañuy boole wilaas yi, te kaar yi mënu ñu àgg foofu sunu jaaree ci biti."" This means roads (Yoon yi), trains (otoraay) and boats (bato yi) connect the villages. Cars (kaar yi) cannot access them from the outside.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **C: Ci otoraay wala ci gaal** (By train or by boat)"
Lan la baatu Italien bii di ‘Cinque Terre’ di tekki?,"The correct answer is **A: Juróomi wilaas**.

The passage states: ""Cinque Terre... moo boole juróomi wilaas yu ndaw yi..."" which translates to ""Cinque Terre... includes five small villages..."" Therefore, Cinque Terre means ""Five Villages"".
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xêt bi, ban xeeti dàll bot moo baax ci anami séddaay yuy tarxiisal?","The correct answer is **A: Dàll bot yu am talon yu sew**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that talons should be ""gàtt te yaatu"" (short and wide). ""Sew"" translates to wide or thick, which aligns with this description.
*   The passage doesn't emphasize metal components (Option B) as a primary feature, but rather as an add-on (karampon) for *additional* traction.
*   Option C contradicts the passage, which recommends *short* talons.
*   Option D contradicts the passage, which states motifs should be 5mm (1/5 inch) *or deeper*."
Ban ci yile moo dul tax ñu mën amal ay yeesal ci xêcc ci tali yi ci jamonoy séddaay?,"The passage describes several things used to improve traction on icy roads and sidewalks:

*   **Special treads on shoes:** Deep, soft treads, crampons, and wide, short heels.
*   **Materials spread on roads:** Gravel, sand, and Calcium Chloride.

The passage mentions gravel, sand and Calcium Chloride (Xorom in Wolof) as things that improve traction. Water (Ndox in Wolof) would make the surface more slippery when it freezes.

Therefore, the answer is **D: Ndox**"
Ban ci yile mooy luy niro bu baax ak Hawaii ak Duunu yu Cook?,"The correct answer is **C: Ñoo bokk waxtu** (They share the same time zone).

The passage states: ""Moom ak Hawaï ñoo bokk fuseau horaire..."" (It and Hawaii share a time zone...).  The other options are incorrect based on the passage.
"
Ban ci yile moo dul xamle Duuni Cook ci anam gu leer?,"The correct answer is **B: Ñoom ñaar ñépp ay archipel lañu (Both are archipelagos)**

Here's why:

* **P** states the Cook Islands is ""Ab dég bu bolé fukki dun ak juróom tas..."" which is an archipelago.

* **P** also states ""Moom ak Hawaï ñoo bokk fuseau horaire, yenn saay ñu leen di woowe """"Hawaii bi ci suuf""""."" which indicates they have the same time zone.

* **P** also states ""Yiñ ci gëna ràññee ñooy Rarotonga ak Aitutaki."" which means the most well-known islands are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.

* While the passage does compare the Cook Islands in size to Hawaii, stating ""Donte mo ci gëna tuuti, dafay fàttali yenn gan yu magget yi nekk ci Hawaii laata ñuy moom seen bopp te amul woon otelu turist yu mag yi ak yeneen yokkute."", the question asks ""Ban ci yile moo dul xamle Duuni Cook ci anam gu leer?"". This comparison is not an explicit description of the Cook Islands.
"
Ban ci yile post garde forestier mooy joxe ñaari xeeti tànnéefi dëkkuwaay?,"The answer is **A: Sirena**.

The text states ""Sirena mooy benn bërëb ranger bi lay jox foy fanan ak lékk gu tàng."" This means Sirena offers both lodging (fanan) and hot meals (lékk gu tàng), which are two types of accommodation. The other options (LaLeona, San Pedrillo, and Los Patos) only offer lodging (""du la jox lekk dëkku waay rekk lalay jox"").
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bii, fan nga mëna jàppee ab permis garaas so bëggee jëfandikoo xaalis bu teew bu bokkul ak keredi?","The correct answer is **C: CafeNet El Sol**.

The passage states: ""CafeNet El Sol joxe na am sàrwiisu jàpp palaas ci njëggu US$30, wama $10 ngir paasu benn bis; mën nga gis leeral yi ci seen xëtu Corcivado."" (CafeNet El Sol offers a service to reserve places for a fee of US$30, or $10 for a one-day pass; you can see the details on their Corcivado website). This indicates that CafeNet El Sol can help you reserve a spot.

The passage also indicates that the ranger station in Puerto Jiménez does not take credit cards, so you must use cash. Therefore, if you want to use cash to reserve a spot, CafeNet El Sol is the best option.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban xeetu skiing lañu def ci barab bu am ay eskaliyee?","The passage explicitly states ""ski de randonnée"" as a type of skiing and implies it involves elements of both ski touring/trekking and downhill skiing. The question asks about the type of skiing done in a place with ""escaliers"" (escaliers in French which translates to steps or stairs in English). The passage describes ""ski de randonnée"" as including elements of both trekking and skiing so it is very possible this type of skiing could take place in a location with stairs. The other options are less specific or in French and do not describe the elements of trekking and skiing.

Therefore, the best answer is:

**D: Randonnée à ski**
"
"Sunu sukandikoo ci xët bi, lan mooy mëna jàppale ñiy def ski de randonnée yu bëgg àgg ci gaawaay bu gëna kawe?","The correct answer is **C: Anam yu baax (Good form)**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Ci anam yu baax di nga mëna daw ay digante yu gëna mag jéego yi – waaye li ci gëna neew, di ngeen am ay gaawaayu ski de fond bu andul ak sak bu diis buñuy boot ci yoon yuñu rëdd.""
*   This translates to: ""With good form you can ski great distances with your strides – but at least you'll have cross-country skiing speed without a heavy pack dragging in the pre-set tracks.""
*   The sentence directly connects good form to achieving greater speed.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bot yu gëna dëgër (More stable boots):** The text states ""the latter (skiing in deep snow) requires more sturdy skis and boot bindings,"" but it doesn't imply that sturdier boots would help in getting to a higher speed in general.
*   **B: Sac à dos bu diis (Heavy backpack):** The text suggests the opposite, that a heavy backpack hinders speed.
*   **D: Piste yuñu rëdd (Pre-set tracks):** While pre-set tracks are mentioned in the context of cross-country skiing, the passage implies that ski touring doesn't necessarily involve such tracks.
"
Wey-tukki yuy ab chogu dugg dañuy am jafe-jafe ngir def lan?,"Based on the text, the best answer is:

**D: Jotaat ci seeni cosaanu bopp (Returning to their own culture)**

**Explanation:**

The passage discusses the challenges people face when returning home after a long time abroad. It highlights the following points:

*   ""Sogu duggaat mooy gëna teela ñëw sogu cosaan...mu yagg lool, te mën naa gëna metti"" - Re-entry shock (sogu duggaat) is often more intense and prolonged than culture shock.
*   ""Soo ñibbee ginaaw boo tukkee bitiw réew lu yàgg, dangay tàmm yeneen aada te dangay fàtte lu bari ci sa cosaan ak mbir yoo baaxoo woon di def"" - After a long time abroad, people adapt to new customs and forget aspects of their own culture.

Therefore, the main difficulty faced by returning travelers (wey-tukki yuy ab chogu dugg) is readjusting to their own culture (jotaat ci seeni cosaanu bopp)."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, chogu dugg dina mëna nekk lu jafe lool ci ban xeeti wey-tukki?","The correct answer is **A: Wey-tukki yu dundu chogu cosaan yu bon lool.**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that ""Sogu duggaat mooy gëna teela ñëw sogu cosaan (tuuti lañ ci am ci lune de miel bi), mu yagg lool, te mën naa gëna metti."" This translates to ""Reverse culture shock is often faster than culture shock (they don't experience it as much during the honeymoon phase), it lasts longer, and can be harder."" This directly connects reverse culture shock (sogu duggaat) with negative experiences of the original culture (sogu cosaan).

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B:** The passage talks about *adjusting* quickly to a new culture but doesn't imply that it avoids reverse culture shock upon return.
*   **C:** The honeymoon phase (lune de miel) is mentioned as a period where initial culture shock is lessened, but the passage focuses on what happens *after* this phase, especially upon returning home.
*   **D:** While reverse culture shock can be unsettling, the option doesn't directly connect to the idea of experiencing one's *own* culture negatively upon returning."
Ban ci yile la nit ñi waral mooytu di def ak nagu àll?,"The passage states that people can get hurt if they approach moose because people don't realize moose protect themselves from attack. The passage also states that moose are not friendly.

Therefore, the best answer is:

*   **B: Jege ko bu baax (Getting too close)**

The passage directly warns against approaching moose. The other options are either actions to take (being observant, minimizing disturbance, watching from a distance) or not relevant to the warning."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, Ban ci yile kàddu ci nangu àll yi mo nekkul dëgg?","Ci xët bi, waxuñu ci moos yi ""mala yu soxor lañu naturellement"". Xët bi dafa wax ni soxorugnu lool, wayé dinañu aar seen bopp. Kon, A moo gën a dëggul.

So, the answer is **A: Ay mala yu soxor lañu naturellement**.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile mooy doon bi ci gëna ñakka dangereux ngir ab wey-tukki ci desert bi?","Let's analyze the passage and the options:

*   **P:** The passage describes the dangers of mirages (seeming to see water) in the desert. Following a mirage can lead to wasted energy and water. It also mentions the extreme temperature swings, where nights can be very cold.
*   **Q:** The question asks which option is *least* dangerous for a desert traveler.

Let's examine each option:

*   **A: Ñakkum yere yu tang ci guddi gu sédd (Lack of warm clothes on a cold night):** The passage explicitly states this can be deadly. Therefore, it's dangerous.
*   **B: Gis ab mirage buy def lu melni ndox (Seeing a mirage that looks like water):** Seeing a mirage in itself is not dangerous. The dangers come from *acting* on the mirage.
*   **C: Yaqum enersi sooy topp mirage bi (Wasting energy by following a mirage):** The passage says this is a problem.
*   **D: Yaqum ndox sooy topp mirage bi (Wasting water by following a mirage):** The passage also identifies this as a major problem.

**Conclusion:**

Option B is the least dangerous, because simply *seeing* a mirage isn't harmful. The dangers arise from *acting* on the mirage. Options A, C and D all have the potential to lead to death.

**Therefore, the correct answer is B: Gis ab mirage buy def lu melni ndox.**"
Ban ci yile lañu xamle ni ab fitna buñu njort ngir wey-tukki yi?,"The correct answer is **C: Hypothermie**

Here's why:

*   **P** talks about extreme temperature changes in deserts, being very hot during the day and very cold at night. It warns that if you don't have warm clothes, the cold can kill you if you stay there for too long.
*   **Hypothermie** is a dangerous drop in body temperature. The passage directly mentions the risk of freezing to death from the cold in the desert at night, which is exactly what hypothermie is about.
*   **Deñc ndox**: The passage mentions that travelers may not be able to find water, and could use up the water they stored while trying to chase mirages. However, it is only mentioned as a possibility, and not the biggest risk.
*   **Mirages** are optical illusions that can waste energy and water.
*   **Weeru ci naaj** (solar eclipse) isn't mentioned in the passage.

Therefore, the text is most explicitly warning about the danger of hypothermie."
"Sunu sukkadndikoo ci xët bi, ban kuréelu askan lañu indil ay lorange yu metti bi exploreurs yi aksee?","The correct answer is C: Taínos yi.

The text states that Spanish conquerors greatly reduced the Tainos population after the arrival of European explorers.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban lakk la Caraïbes yi di lakk?","The correct answer is **D: Arawakan**.

The passage states: ""Làkk wi Caribe yi daan làkk mooy arawakan..."" which translates to ""The language that the Caribs spoke was Arawakan...""
"
Kan lañu wara nangul ni mooy ki siiwal ski niki ab po bu joxe mbekte?,"The correct answer is **A: Ski bums**.

The passage states: ""Ski dafa nekk powum tukki gu am solo boole ci dey beggal xol, ñu xam ko yen saay ci “ski bums”, di tëral ay tukki noppalu ci def ski ci barab yu nu tànn."" This translates to: ""Ski is an important travel hobby that combines the joy of the heart, they are often known as 'ski bums', who describe relaxing trips by skiing in places they choose.""

Therefore, ""ski bums"" are known for associating skiing with pleasure and relaxation.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lu jege ban jamono lañu njëkka nangu ski niki ab tàggat-yaram?","The correct answer is **C: 1861**.

The text states ""...ci attum 1861 la ay Norwegians ubbi mbotayu ski bu njeekk fële ca Australia"" which translates to ""...in 1861 Norwegians opened the first ski club in Australia."" This indicates the beginning of organized skiing as a sport. While the text mentions evidence of skiing dating back to 5000 BC, that refers to its existence, not its formal recognition as a sport.
"
Ban ci yile lañuy mengale li ci ëpp ak duunu Côte Est bu Afrique?,"The answer is **A: Influence bu Orop** (European Influence).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions European colonialism starting in the 15th century with Vasco de Gama. This highlights a significant and historical European influence.
*   Islam is mentioned as being brought by the Arabs, but the passage emphasizes the long-standing impact of European colonialism.
*   While wildlife is mentioned in relation to Madagascar, it's not the primary theme of the entire passage.
*   Deluxe resorts are not specifically discussed in the provided text.

Therefore, European Influence is the most comprehensive answer for this passage."
Lan moo ekkul lu gëna ndaw ci luñuy mengale ak duuni Côte Ouest bu Afrique? ,"The correct answer is **D: Moomeel ci yeneeni réew**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Dun yu ndaw yu bare ay dëkk yu moom seen bopp lañu, wala nu booleleen ak France..."" This directly indicates that many of these islands are either independent or are dependencies of other countries (like France).

Let's look at why the other options are not as accurate:

*   **A: Ab lëkkaloo ak Farans:** While some islands are connected to France, this isn't a universal trait for all of them.
*   **B: Ay resort deluxe yu bari:** This is mentioned only as ""te nu gën leen xam ci tefes yu bàkkane"" which is not as accurate as the information about ownership/dependencies.
*   **C: Luñu xam ci all bi:** While Madagascar is noted for this, the passage doesn't state that all East African islands are famous for their wilderness. Also, option D is a more direct parallel."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, nan la yenn nit yu xarañ ci jangu yu yàgg yi?","The text states that ""Lu gëna bari ci jàngu yu njëkk ya deñuy jàpp guddi fetu paak ci samdi guddi ci biir wiikendu paak"" which translates to ""Most of the early schools observed the Easter vigil on Saturday night during Easter weekend.""  This implies organizing a vigil.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: Nos ab veillée wu gaawu ci guddi** (Organize an early vigil at night)
"
"Ngir moytu yenn càkkutéef yi sooy dugg Equateur, ab doomu Cuba lan la wara am?","The correct answer is **B: Ab bataaxal invitation buñu legalisé** (An invitation letter that has been legalized).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ekwadoor dafay sàkku ci doomi waa Cuba ñu xaar ba jot bataaxal bulen di woo ci dëk bi balaa ñuy mëna jaar ci aeropoor yi..."" (Ecuador requires Cuban citizens to wait until they receive an invitation letter to the country before being able to pass through airports...) This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ab passport bu baax bu 6 weer yu ëpp bisu tukki yi** (A valid passport valid for more than 6 months from the date of travel) The document mentioned a passport valid for at least 5 months.
*   **C: Ab tiket dem ak dikk ngir firndéel yaggaayu dëkk bi** (A round-trip ticket to prove the length of the stay) While a round-trip ticket is required, it is not mentioned in this portion as related to restrictions on Cubans
*   **D: Ab Carte grise bu Amerig** (A US Green Card) The document mentioned that Cuban citizens with a US Green Card should go to the Ecuatorian consulate to request a visa.

Therefore, option B is the only one supported by the provided text."
Ngir ban sabab lañu defarul waréefi tukki yi?,"The correct answer is **B: Weyal ab lawaayu dem ak dikk buñu nos (Facilitate a controlled travel flow)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the measures are in place ""ngir joxé tukki yu aw ci yoon ci digganté ñaari réew yi"" which translates to ""to provide legal/formal travel between the two countries."" This aligns perfectly with the idea of facilitating a controlled or regulated travel flow (lawaayu dem ak dikk buñu nos).

The other options are not the primary reason:

*   **A: Weyal limu wey-tukki yi ci dayoo bu gëna ndaw (Reduce the number of travelers)** - While the measures might indirectly affect the number of travelers, the primary goal stated is about regulating the travel process, not simply reducing numbers.
*   **C: Firndeel ab diirub dëkk (Verify the duration of stay)** - While the passage mentions needing to provide proof of the length of stay, that is just a requirement for the travel authorization and not the primary reason the regulations were changed.
*   **D: Garanti baaxaayu passports yi (Guarantee the validity of passports)** - Although the passage mentions that passports need to be valid for at least 6 months, it is a simple condition for entry and not the main reason for the change in travel requirements."

*   **B: Ordinaas bi mëna baña baax ci yenn kaadar yi** (The software might not work on some equipment).

The text mentions that some used equipment might need repairs (""am na yoo xam ne mën nañoo nekk yu nu toppandoo defar leen""). This implies a risk of the equipment not functioning properly. While the other options aren't directly addressed as risks *specific* to foreign used equipment in this passage, the need for repairs and potential incompatibility is explicitly mentioned."
"Lu àju ci jëfandikoo xaalis ci Falklands, yan ci yile kaddu ñooy dëgg?","The correct answer is **C: Dañoo wara wecci livres yu Falkland soo leen jogee ci duuni yi (You should exchange Falkland pounds before leaving the islands).**

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Daanaka mënuta nekk ngir wéecee xaalisu Falklands ci biti dun yi, kon weccoo leen seen xaalis bala ngeena genn dun yi."" This translates to: ""It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kartu keredi yu Angale ak livres sterling yi kese lañuy nangu ci duuni yi ko wër (Only English credit cards and pounds sterling are accepted on the islands around it).** The text says that pounds sterling is generally accepted, however, in certain towns, credit cards are not, so the usage is not exclusive to this type of credit card.
*   **B: Stanley mooy mennum barab buy nangu dolaaru amerig (Stanley is the only place that accepts US dollars).** The text says Stanley accepts cards, but it isn't the only place that accepts dollars.
*   **D: Suñ ci gennee livre bu Falkland, livre sterling mooy faral di nekk xaalis buñu nangu (Apart from the Falkland pound, the pound sterling is generally the currency that is accepted).** The text suggests that pound sterling is generally accepted on the islands, but this is not accurate outside of the Falkland islands."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bii, sooy tukki bawoo Falklands ci Etats-Unis, fan la ab anamu pay bu wuuteek kartu keredi doonee lu am solo?","The correct answer is **A: Ci butiku FIC WEST**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that the only bank on the islands is located within the FIC WEST shop in Stanley. This implies it's the primary and possibly only place to exchange currency.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   B: The entire islands are not a specific place.
*   C: The text doesn't mention islands around the Falklands.
*   D: The only bank in Stanley is in the FIC WEST shop, which is the specific recommended option."

The text states: ""Festival yu temple Kerala yi daño jara seetaan, ak ñay yuñu dekoore faral di romb,..."" This implies the decorated floats are seen *during Kerala temple festivals* which take place on the streets of Kerala.

Let's break down why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Fépp bawoo ci njeextalu Nowambar ba ci diggu weeru Mai** (Everywhere from the end of November to the middle of May): While this timeframe indicates when the festivals might occur, it doesn't specify *where* the decorated floats are seen.

*   **B: ci temple yi** (in the temples): The text says the floats ""romp"" (pass by/travel) indicating they are moving outside of the temples.

*   **C: Ànd di def seeni ñaan ci festival i barabu jaamukaay.** (During the performance of prayers at the shrine festivals): While this might be part of the context, it doesn't specifically address the location of the decorated floats.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate and direct answer to the question."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile mooy anam buñu gëna yaakaar ngir sakkanal xaalis ci première classe wala ci classe affaires?","The text says: ""P: Yoon bi gënna leer ngir jël business class mooy nga genne xaalis bu bare ngir lu rey loolu (wala, nga def ba ca kë liggéeyukaay defal la ko).""

This translates to: ""The clearest way to get business class is to spend a lot of money on it (or, have your workplace pay for it).""

Therefore, the most likely method to save money on premium class travel, according to the text, is to have your workplace pay for it. This corresponds to option A.

So the answer is **A: Teg ko ci ndoddu këru-liggéeyukaay bi** (Have your workplace pay for it).

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan mooy doon yaq sa temps di wut sooy jàpp palaas ci yenn classes u njëg yi?","The correct answer is **C: Wàññi yi (Discounts)**.

Here's why:

* The text clearly states: ""jarul sax jeema seet as wàññi ngir bisines wala kalas ekonomi toogu yi ci tukki buy jubal jóge A dem B"" which translates to ""it's not even worth trying to look for discounts for business or economy class seats on direct flights from A to B."" This means searching for discounts in these cases is a waste of time.

The passage states: ""...bulen fate yokk si njëg luy dem ci visa yi, juuti yuñuy dolli ci depaar yi, dem ak dikk jaare ko ci suuf, ak yeneen, si barab yii yépp yi nek biti africa."" (Don't forget to add the cost of visas, departure taxes, ground transportation, and other costs for places outside of Africa). This directly supports the need to include the cost of travel to/from places outside of Africa.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ci lan la supermarchés yi di tambalee jaay ab tànneef bu gëna bari ay mbir?","The correct answer is **A: Ñam buñu togg ba noppi**.

The passage states, ""Ci lu gëna bari supermarsé yi dañoo nekk di am tànnéefu lekk buñu togg ba noppi bu wuute lool"" which translates to ""Most supermarkets are now offering a wide variety of ready-to-eat food."" This directly answers the question of what supermarkets are starting to sell more of.
"
Yan jumtukaay yu yenn supermarchés yi di joxe ñooy mêna xëcc ab kiliyaan buy jënd ay ñam yuñu togg ba noppi?,"The correct answer is **D: Ab four u Micro-onde** (A microwave oven).

The passage specifically mentions that some supermarkets provide a microwave or other tools to heat up food. This is a direct tool that attracts customers to buy pre-cooked food.
"
Ban ci yile lañu warul al Belge ak Swiss yuy lakk français lañu mëna baña dégg?,"The correct answer is **B: Baati français yu xejjiku (Unique French words)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Belgians and Swiss francophones can understand each other even though their French differs slightly from standard French and from each other.
*   It specifically mentions differences in how they express numbers and the pronunciation of some words.
*   Importantly, it says that while the pronunciation of *some* words differs, and the numbering systems differ, everyone learns standard French in school. This means they will still be able to understand what someone is saying using the standard numbering system.

Option B corresponds to ""waxinu yenn baat yi xaw nañu wuute tuuti"" which translates to ""the pronunciation of some words is a little different"". So, even with some differences, they would probably be able to understand each other even if the pronunciation of the words is different.

The reason the others are wrong:

*   **A:** The passage says that even though there are differences in the way they refer to numbers, they all understand the standard numbering system, meaning that there is no problem in understanding it.

*   **C:** The passage states that despite pronunciation differences, mutual understanding is generally possible.

*   **D:** There is no evidence in the passage that implies that *le français de France* would be impossible for them to understand. Instead it says that they all learn *le français standard* meaning that they are all familiar with the French spoken in France."
Ban ci yile moo bokkul ak bi am France niki ci Belgique wala Swiss?,"The correct answer is **B: Anam buñuy joxe nimero yi (The way numbers are given)**

The passage states: ""Rawatina, anam wi waa Belgique biy làkk francais ak ci waa Suisse di defee seeni nimero xawna wuute ak ni ko ñiy làkk francais bu réewum France di defee"" (Especially, the way Belgians and Swiss speak French and how they give their numbers is slightly different from how French people from France do it).

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Niñuy waxee baat yépp (How all words are pronounced):** The passage says ""waxiinu yenn baat yi xaw nañu wuute tuuti"" (the pronunciation of *some* words is slightly different), not all words.
*   **C: Français standard buñuy jangale ci lekool yi (Standard French taught in schools):** The passage states ""Belge yi ak Suisse francophone yépp ñu ngi jàngee français standard ci daara yi"" (All francophone Belgians and Swiss learn standard French in schools), indicating that this is the same.
*   **D: Ni ñuy benn-bennalee baatu Français yi (How French words are separated):** There is no mention of differences in how French words are separated or spelled."

Of the options given:

*   **C: So nekke fuñ ladul mena jot (When you are in a place where you cannot get a signal)** is the most relevant because the inability to get a signal implies no data connection.

So the answer is **C**."

The passage explicitly states: ""Nit yu bari dañuy jàpp seen palaas bu yagg (ndax bato yi dañuy faral di fees ci sezon bu mag bi)."" This translates to ""Many people book their spots well in advance (because the boats often fill up during the peak season).""  Therefore, booking in advance is the best way to ensure you get a spot on a boat.

"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan la joueur bu muus wala moytu?","The answer is **A: Naan sangara bu bari (Drink a lot of alcohol)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that casinos offer complimentary drinks to keep customers happy and on the premises.
*   The passage also mentions that drinking alcohol impairs judgment and that sensible gamblers understand the value of restraint. This implies that excessive drinking is a risk factor that a savvy gambler would avoid.

The other options are incorrect based on the text:

*   B: The text mentions that casinos lower the prices of food, drinks and entertainment to please clients.
*   C: The passage states that casinos don't have clocks.
*   D: The passage states that casinos don't make it easy to find the exit."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban xaaju wax lañu def ay araf yu mag ci diggu baatal bi?","The passage states that in the specific writing system being discussed, words for ""Sie"" (which means ""You"") are capitalized in the middle of a sentence. The passage also states that this helps distinguish verbs from objects. ""Sie"" functions as a pronoun, which is a type of **noun**.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Tur** (Noun).
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bii, lan la def afarab bu mag ci tur bi gëna jafe?","The correct answer is **D: Raññaatle ci yëf yi**.

Here's why:

Dafay gëna yombal njàng, doonte mbind mooy loo xam dafa xawa jafe ci soxla bi nu am ngir xool nax santaane bi wala jagle bi jëfandikoo nañu ko ci màndarga bi mu waree."" This means nouns (tur) used with certain verbs always begin with a capital letter, even if in the middle of a sentence.
* **The passage also states:** Lii yoon bu am solo la ngir rañélé verbs yi ak objects yi, which translates to: ""This is an important rule for distinguishing verbs from objects.""

Therefore, the capitalization helps in distinguishing nouns which act as objects from verbs.
"
"Ci dëkku àll yu Malaisie, ban geste mooy tekki “kaay”?","The correct answer is **A: Lem baaraamu joxoñukaay bi**.

The passage states: ""...ci Malaisie, manaam ci Malais yi dëkke ci dëkki àll yi, loolu mooy tekki « kaay », mooy nuroo ak baaraamu joxoñ buñ lem...""  This directly translates to ""In Malaysia, specifically among the Malays living in forest villages, that means 'come', which is similar to a finger being bent.""
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban geste moo wara tekki “dellusil”?","Based on the provided text, none of the options accurately describe the gesture that means ""come here"" (which the passage equates to ""dellusil"" in this context). The text specifically mentions that raising a hand and beckoning someone with a bent finger is the equivalent of ""come here"" in Malaysia (specifically among the Malays living in forest areas), but that this action is used differently in other cultures.

While the closest option might seem to be B (Baŋk ab baaraam), it's important to note that it doesn't fully capture the meaning of the passage. The passage emphasizes the act of beckoning with a bent finger pointed towards oneself.

Therefore, none of the provided options is a perfect fit. However, **B (Baŋk ab baaraam)** is the *most* accurate of the four based on the information provided in the text.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan mo waral ay dagg-dagg ci yaram?","The text describes how ice cracks and collapses, leading to crevices and unstable ice formations. These unstable formations, particularly near melting glaciers, are a hazard.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Pont wu neige (Snow bridges):** The passage specifically mentions that the cracks are difficult to see because of ""pongu niis yi"" which translates to ""snow bridges."" However, the passage is describing the problem, not the cause of the problem.
*   **B: Defukaay galaas yu teeyul (Unstable glacier formations):** This fits the description of collapsing ice and unstable areas near melting glaciers.
*   **C: Daanug ay jali galaas (Falling ice blocks):** The passage mentions ""miir yi ak mbaari xeeri galaas yi mën nañu daanu te seen xar-xar mën naa tëju"" meaning ""ice towers and huge blocks of ice can fall and their crevices can close.""
*   **D: Bolok yu yaatu (Wide blocks):** While wide blocks of ice are mentioned, it's the *instability* and potential for collapse that causes hazards.

Option B - ""Defukaay galaas yu teeyul (Unstable glacier formations)"" and option C - ""Daanug ay jali galaas (Falling ice blocks)"" both fit very well. Given that the question is about what causes ""dagg-dagg ci yaram"" (cuts and injuries), falling blocks of ice are a more direct cause of injury than just the general instability of the glacier formations.

Therefore, the best answer is **C: Daanug ay jali galaas (Falling ice blocks)**."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile la pont wu neige yi mëna nëbb?","The correct answer is **A: Ay xar-xar**.

The passage states that ""Li day indi ay xarxar, ay kamb, yunu mënul gis ndax pongu niis yi"" which translates to ""It causes cracks and crevasses that are invisible due to snow bridges."" This directly indicates that snow bridges can hide cracks.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, wey-tukki yi dañoo wara waajal seen bopp laata ñuy dem ci ban barab?","The correct answer is **B: Barab yi wër Goma**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that if you are not from Goma, you should be checked to see if there is fighting in Nord-Kivu. This implies that areas surrounding Goma are the ones that require extra preparation and awareness of potential conflicts.
*   The passage mentions that Goma is a safe and secure place."
Ban ci yile moo warul doon ab tektak bu baax ngir ab turist ci Goma?,"The best answer is **D: Suufu volcan Nyiragongo mu ngi feete ci biir dëkk bi** (The lava of Volcano Nyiragongo is located inside the city).

Here's why:

*   **A: Xeey yi ci North Kivu dañoo neex** (The fights in North Kivu are good) - The passage specifically mentions needing to check the security situation in North Kivu, which implies fighting is happening and *not* a good thing. This is bad advice.
*   **B: Barab bu baax la ngir xool ay Gorille wu montaañ** (It's a good place to see mountain gorillas) - The passage explicitly states that the region is a base for accessing easier-to-track mountain gorillas. This is good advice.
*   **C: Taxis -moto yi anam yu baax lañu ngir dem ak dikk** (Motorcycle taxis are good for getting around) - The passage mentions using boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. This is good advice.
*   **D: Suufu volcan Nyiragongo mu ngi feete ci biir dëkk bi** (The lava of Volcano Nyiragongo is located inside the city) - While the volcano's lava *did* flow into the city in 2002, it is not an accurate statement to say it is currently located *inside* the city. The lava has cooled and hardened and much of the city has been rebuilt on top of it. This could be interpreted as meaning the active lava flow is still present, which would be dangerous and misleading.

Therefore, option D is the worst piece of advice for a tourist."
Kañ la ab permis ginaaw reew ngir ab bisu tambali ci Ut di jàppandi?,"The passage states that permits are available starting on the first day of the month, four months before the start date of the permit.

If the start date is October (Ut), then four months prior would be June.  The first day of June is the answer.

However, none of the options are June.  Let's re-examine the logic.

*   Start date: October (Ut)
*   Four months before: June

Looking at the options again, The correct choice would be the **B: 1 fan ci Awril** . Because the question is asking for month to book the permit. So, June minus 2months will give April.

So the final answer is **B: 1 fan ci Awril**."
Ban polotik lañu teg ngir àar canyon bi?,"The correct answer is **D: Limu permis yu yemamaay** (Limited number of permits).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states ""Keeyit yi yamalé nañu leen ngir aar yoon wi"" (The permits are limited to protect the path). This directly supports the idea of a limited number of permits.
*   The passage also states ""Permi yi am bariwul te nu denc leen ngir laaj yu amul rendez vous jàppandi ngir ku njëkka ñëw njëkka am."" (The permits are not many and are reserved for non-appointment requests to be applied for on a first-come-first-served basis.) which tells us there is a permit reservation system in place.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ab sistemu permis njëkka ñëw njëkka am** (A first-come-first-served permit system) - While a portion of permits are available first-come, first-served, the main system revolves around reservations, making this a less accurate overall answer.
*   **B: Permis yi 1 fan ci Samwiyee lañuy jàppandi** (Permits are applied for on January 1st) - This refers to a specific date for a May entry, not a general policy.
*   **C: Ci ay càkkutéef yu soxlawul rendez-vous lañu mêna amee permis** (Permits can be obtained in non-appointment requests) - This only describes one way of obtaining permits, not the overarching policy.

Therefore, **D** is the best answer because it directly reflects the policy of limiting permits to protect the canyon."
Ban ci mbir yii mooy buñu gaawul mëna gis ci xeetu otel buñu xamle ci xët bi?,"The correct answer is **D: Néeg yuñu yeesal bu yagul dara ak ay yeesal yu bees**.

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes that these hotels are *old*, from a ""golden age"" before World War II. They're characterized by ""anciens couloirs,"" ""un manque de commodités modernes,"" and signs of age (""des rideaux passés""). Modern renovations would be the *opposite* of their described character.

The other options are possible, even likely, in this type of grand hotel:

*   **A: Ab baaru cocktail:** Grand hotels often have cocktail bars.
*   **B: Ab restoran gourment ci barab bi:** Upscale dining is common in such establishments.
*   **C: Yeneen gan yuñu xam bu baax wala ñu yomba raññee:** Celebrities and prominent figures were known to frequent these hotels."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xibar yuñu joxe ci xët bi, ban ci yile neexal la otel bi di gëna ñakka wara jox priorité?","Let's analyze the provided text:

*   **Focus on Nostalgia/History:** The text emphasizes the connection to the ""âge d'or"" of luxury travel before World War II, a time when these hotels were *the* places for the wealthy and famous. They evoke a sense of history and tradition.
*   **Charm of Decay/Imperfection:** There's mention of ""colin bu yàgg yi, ñàkkum neexal yu mujj yi, ak ay yenn yuy lay tere magget"" (old furniture, lack of modern comfort, and things that show their age). This suggests that these elements are part of the hotels' character, not something to be eliminated.
*   **Accessibility:** The passage contrasts the past (where these hotels were exclusive destinations) with the present, where anyone with money can fly anywhere and stay in any hotel. This emphasizes that the exclusivity and historical significance are what set these hotels apart.

Now let's look at the options and prioritize what would be *least* important for the hotel to focus on, given its historical/nostalgic appeal:

*   **A: Meuble yu yàgg ci barab bi yépp (Old furniture throughout the place)**: The passage explicitly mentions old furniture (""colin bu yàgg yi"") as part of the hotel's character. Removing this would detract from its charm.

*   **B: Ab restora bu am togkat bu aay (A restaurant with a renowned chef)**: A high-quality restaurant would likely be desirable for the hotel.

*   **C: Ab salon buy def ay animations ci guddi (A lounge that has entertainment at night)**: A comfortable lounge with entertainment could potentially add value to the hotel.

*   **D: Ay njëgi néeg yu yomb (Inexpensive room rates)**: Inexpensive room rates would be the least important neexal for this hôtel. The point of these historical hotels isn't to be affordable. The text talks about the exclusivity, history, and wealthiness associated with the hotel. Therefore, inexpensive rates would damage the hotel's exclusivity.

**Conclusion:**

Given the emphasis on historical charm and exclusivity, inexpensive room rates (Option D) would be the *least* prioritized improvement for these hotels.

**Therefore, the correct answer is D.**
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan la wey-tukki yu bëgga dem Greenland wara moytu?","The correct answer is **D: Royu ci ab doomu réewy Greenland niki ab “Eskimo”**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states that the term ""Eskimo"" is considered offensive in non-US Arctic regions, particularly in Canada. Therefore, tourists should avoid using this term when referring to the local people.
*   **A:** Although the passage mentions suicide rates, it doesn't tell tourists they should be worried or concerned.
*   **B:** Although, the passage mentions ""Soo demee Greenland ci jamono seddaay bi (di bàyyi xel ni loo gëna dem ci bët gannaar, mu gëna sedd), dafa am solo nga yóbb yere yu diis."", it doesn't specify tourists should worry about all year round as the passage states: ""Bis yu yàgg lool ci jamonoy tangoor mën naa waral jafe-jafe yi mëna nelaw bu baax ak jafe-jafey wergu-yaram yuñ ci boole."".
*   **C:** Although it states it's very connected in Greenland, it doesn't have bearing on the fact that they should think about employment, and therefore isn't the correct answer."
"Sunu sukkandiko ci xët bi, ban cu yile moo wara nekk luy waral ay jafe-jafe ngir wey-tukki yuy dem Greeland?","The correct answer is **C: Jawwu**.

The text mentions both the cold weather in winter and the long days in summer as potential issues for travelers to Greenland. These factors relate to the climate or ""jawwu"" of Greenland.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ay yoo yu Nordique:** While the text advises avoiding Nordic Yews (a type of plant), it's not presented as a major obstacle for travelers. It's more of a minor annoyance.
*   **B: Kirim:** There is no mention of Kirim in the text.
*   **D: Waa foofu:** The text does not suggest that the people of Greenland present any particular challenges for travelers. It even emphasizes the absence of serious crime and a welcoming atmosphere."
Ban ci yile lañuy jëfandikoo léegi ci plaza central?,"The text states that Jardín de la Unión functions as a central plaza.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Jardín de la Unión**
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yule moo amul ci Jardín de la Unión?","The correct answer is **B: Këru jaar-jaar bu yagg (An old museum)**

The text mentions:

*   **A: Ab pavillon central ak ay concerts (A central pavilion and concerts):** ""gon gi dafay am ay konseer yu amul fay bi joge ci santaraal Gazebo"" - This means there are free concerts from the central gazebo.
*   **C: Ay Restoran yu nekk ci wetu sardeŋ bi (Restaurants located around the garden):** ""Amna ay restoran yu beri ñi wër toll bi"" - There are many restaurants around the square.
*   **D: Ab tabax bu yagg bu teggu ci ay sàrt (An old building based on principles):** The Jardín de la Unión was originally built as the atrium for a 17th-century convent.

The text does **not** mention an old museum. Therefore, that is the thing that is missing."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban cu yile wax yu ci ab randonnée benn bis lañu mêna jàppee niki lu jubadi?","The correct answer is **A, B, and C**. Let's break down why:

*   **A: Tuuti waajal lañu soxla ngir ay randonnée ci ay sentiers yu yomb** - The passage states: ""Doxantu bés dafa rax ay tolluwaay yu gëna tuuti ab junni ba tolluwaaay yu gën gudd yu nu mënees dox ci benn bés. Ngir doxantu benn bés ci ab yoon bu yomb tuuti waajtaay la laaj..."" (A day hike on an easier trail requires little preparation). This directly supports option A.

*   **B: Soriwaay yi dañuy wuute, waaye dañ leen wara muur ci benn fan** -The passage states: ""Doxantu bés dafa rax ay tolluwaay yu gëna tuuti ab junni ba tolluwaaay yu gën gudd yu nu mënees dox ci benn bés."" (Day hikes range from distances of less than a mile to much longer distances that can be walked in a day.)This supports option B.

*   **C: Nit yu am ab forme physique bu yemamaay dañuy faral di mëna def activité bii** - The passage states: ""Ngir doxantu benn bés ci ab yoon bu yomb tuuti waajtaay la laaj, te bepp nit bu am tàggat yaram bu yam mën na ci bokk."" (A day hike on an easier trail requires little preparation, and anyone with reasonable fitness can participate.) This confirms that people with a moderate level of fitness can generally do it.

*   **D: Randonnée bis nekkul ab activité buñu wara def ci diggu bis bëcëg ak ay liir** - The passage does not talk about randonnée bis only to be made at the middle of the day. So, this is false.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **A, B, and C**."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kañ la ab randonnée wu bis di laajee waajal bu yemamaay?","The correct answer is **B: Su nekkee ab sentier bu yomb**.

The text states: ""Doxantu bés dafa rax ay tolluwaay yu gëna tuuti ab junni ba tolluwaaay yu gën gudd yu nu mënees dox ci benn bés. **Ngir doxantu benn bés ci ab yoon bu yomb tuuti waajtaay la laaj**, te bepp nit bu am tàggat yaram bu yam mën na ci bokk."" This directly says that a day hike on an easy trail only requires minimal preparation.
"
Ci nan la plateaux yu nekk Rogaland wala Agder wuutee ak li ds ci Norvège?,"The correct answer is **D: Ay bruyère ñoo leen di faral di muur**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that plateaus in Rogaland and Agder are often called ""hei,"" meaning barren land often covered with heather. ""Bruyère"" is French for heather.

The other options are incorrect based on the text:

*   **A: Dañoo am ay garab**: The text says they are barren lands without trees.
*   **B: Amul ay fjord**: The text says nothing about a lack of fjords.
*   **C: Plateaux dañu tolloo li ci ëpp**: The text says plateaus are high altitude."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, yan ci yii ñoo dul nekk bawoo Norvège?","Ci kanamu xët bi, P wax na ""vidde"" mooy ay plateaux yu yaatu, yu ubbeeku yu amul garab ci Norwees. ""Hei"" itam mooy suuf su amul garab. ""Fjords"" itam am nañu ci Norwees. Lande la xët bi waxul ci.

"
Kañ la touriste yu bëgg ski wara dem ci station montaañ yi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ci jamonoy séddaay** (In the winter).

The passage states that mountains offer activities like skiing and snowboarding during the cold season (jamono seddaay). Therefore, tourists who want to ski should go during the winter.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kañ la tourist yi di gëna bari ci station montaañ yi?","The correct answer is **C: Ci jamonoy été bu Ind**

The text says ""Waxtu yi touriste di bari lu ñuy dem ci montagne yi, gën gaa bari dañuy dem ba été indien."" which translates to ""The time when tourists go to the mountains is the most, they mostly go during Indian Summer.""
"
Lan nga wara moytu def so yaakaare gis ab bato buy sakku ndimbal?,"Based on the passage, the focus is on actively engaging with people at the marina, gathering information, and becoming known. The text suggests approaching people who are offering rides, sharing information, or fixing boats.

Therefore, the action that would be *least* helpful in finding a boat seeking help is:

*   **D: Baña bayyi xel ci ñiy def auto-stop** (Ignoring people who are hitchhiking)

The passage implies that these hitchhikers could potentially know about or be connected to boats in need. Ignoring them would mean missing a potential source of information.
"
Lan nga wara def ci manines ci sooy set ab bato bu soxla ndimbal?,"Based on the passage, the best answer is **A: Jokkoo ak feeykat yi (Jéema jokkook napkat yu nekk ci baar bi)**.

The passage explicitly advises you to try and connect with people in bars (napkat yu nekk ci baar bi) when you arrive at the marina. This aligns with the broader strategy of gathering information and finding leads.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Nekk ci suuf radaar bi (Nekk ci suuf radaar bi)**: No mention of being in the soil radar
*   **C: Jefe nit ñu kese suñuy nettoyer seen yacht (jegewaale nit yuy fomp seeni gaal)**: The passage states to not neglect people cleaning their yacht.
*   **D: Moytu yeneen auto-stoppeurs (Moytu yeneen auto-stoppeurs)**: There is no mention of avoiding other hitchhikers.

Therefore, **A** is the most logical and relevant action based on the provided text."
Ban barab la ab touriste wara bëgg ci jaar-jaaru colonial bu duuni bi?,"The correct answer is **A: Tefesu bëj-ganaar**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mooy barab bi britanik jàppee ni ñoo ko moomal seen bopp, kon sudee danga wër taarixu jaar-jaaru kolonisasioŋ bi, fii nga wara tàmbalee."" This translates to ""It's the place where the British considered to be theirs, so if you want to explore the history of colonization, this is where you should start."" Since Hong Kong Island is the place the British considered theirs, and the passage uses the word ""duni Hong Kong"" which means Hong Kong Island, and tefesu bëj-ganaar means the North Shore, then A is the correct answer
"
Ban barab mooy nara neexab touriste buy jiitël gis yu raget yi?,"The correct answer is **D: Front de mer bu Kowloon**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Soo bëggee gis taaru Hong Kong, danga fay joge nga dem ci Kowloon nekk ci géej gi mu jàkkarlool, dinga gis taar bi."" (If you want to see the beauty of Hong Kong, you should go to Kowloon and be on the seafront facing it, you will see the beauty).
"
Lan la yenn selle yi am ngir jappale ci waññi risku tanki kiy war fas bi keppu ci ab étrier?,"The correct answer is **B: Baaru kaarànge yi** (Safety bars).

The passage states: ""yenn selles yi, rawatina selles yu Angale yi, dañoo am ay baaru kaarànge yuy tax etriyee daanu ci selle bi suko ab warkat buy xëccee ci ginnaaw."" which translates to ""some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup to come off the saddle if a rider falls backward."" This directly addresses the question of what some saddles have to help reduce the risk of a rider's foot getting stuck in a stirrup.
"
Ban xeetu botu dawalukaay fas mooy jàppale ci yokk kaaràngey dawalkatu fas bi biñuy jëfandikoo ab étrier?,"The passage states: ""Bu njëkk, dawlkat yu bare de nuy sol ay bot ak yu am talong ak tegu bu sew te ritax.""  This translates to: ""In the past, many riders used to wear boots with heels and thick, non-slip soles.""

The best answer from the options that describes this is:

*   **C: Ab talon** (A heel)  While the passage also mentions a thick sole, the heel (talon) is specifically mentioned as a feature of the boots that riders used to wear, which provides more security.

Therefore, the answer is **C**."
Lan lañuy jox ñiy tukki ci réseau joxante teranga yi?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Jiox leen ay dëkkuwaay ci ay dalalkat yi ci dëkk bi.**

The passage describes networks that connect travelers with locals, allowing the travelers to get to know the people in the place they are visiting. The Couchsurfing example illustrates providing **free accommodation** (dëkkuwaay) as the main benefit.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile wax yu aju ci reseau joxante terangayi mo nekkul dëgg?","Let's analyze the statements based on the provided text:

*   **A: Wey-tukki dañuy jot saa su nekk ay royuwaay ngir dalalkat yi ci dëkk bi** - *This statement is NOT explicitly mentioned in the text.*.

*   **B: Yenn reseau mën nañ laaj ñu amal yeneeni saytu ci wey-tukki yi** - ""waaye nak yeneen reseau yi dañu laay laaj yeneen xeetu saytu ci ki nga doon."" - This means other networks might ask for other types of verification from travelers. So, this is true.

*   **C: Wey-tukki yi dañuy jot ab limu dalalkat yu jàppandi ci dëkk buñuy dem** - ""Limum njaatige yu jàppandi yi joxe nanu ko ci ab keyt wal ci lëndd gi te yeneen tukkikat yi xoolaat nanu leen."" - This states that a list of available hosts is provided online. So, this is true.

*   **D: Yenn àdduy dalalkat yi dañuy faral di jappandi ci wey-tukki yi** - It's implied in the entire passage that hosts offer accommodation. Couchsurfing started because someone needed a free place to stay and people offered it. So, this is true.

Therefore, the statement that is NOT supported by the text is A.

**Final Answer: A**"

Here's why, and what the passage *does* say:

*   **The passage states:** ""Féebar buy wallaaté mooy fébar bu gaawa wallé bo jogé kuko am."" This translates to: ""A contagious disease is a disease that is quickly transmitted from someone who has it.""
*   **The correct answer** should mention something about the ease of transmission from person to person. The closest possible answer is **A** although not being a perfect translation."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, la lañu xamul nit dafay waral feebar buy wàllé?","According to the text, a contagious disease (féebar buy wallaaté) is caused by ""bénn pathogen indi, bu mélni ddoomu jangoro, bacterium, fungus"". Therefore, the correct answers would include the agents that cause the disease.

*   **B: Doomu jangoro yi (Viruses)** are mentioned as a cause.
*   **C: Bakteri yi (Bacteria)** are mentioned as a cause.
*   **D: Champignon (Fungus)** are mentioned as a cause.

Option A ""Ñàkku yi (Lack)"" is not listed as causing contagious diseases, so that one is out.

So the correct answer is a combination of B, C and D, since all of them can cause a wallaaté fébar. If I had to select only *one* most directly mentioned, it would have to be **B: Doomu jangoro yi (Viruses)**, since it is the first one listed, but that is still not entirely accurate given the context.

Ci ban anam la tànn ab proxy Web ci kaw ab VPN personnel di doy ngir jëfandikukat bi?,"The correct answer is **C: Jëfandikukaat bi dafay jubalewaat jaabante http ci njëlbéen.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Joxekati VPN (réseau virtuel privé) yi anam yu baax lañu ngir moytu séggu way-polotik yi ak séggu IP commercial yi. Ñoom ñoo ëpp poroxi web yi ci sabab yu bari: dañuy jàllewaat tarafiku internet yépp, yemu ñu ci http kese.""  (VPNs are better than web proxies for political and commercial IP tracking because they redirect *all* internet traffic, not just HTTP.)

* **This implies:** If a user *only* needs to redirect HTTP traffic, a web proxy is sufficient. They don't need the broader scope and advantages of a VPN.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Jëfandikukat dafay bëgg a jubalewaat jaabante yépp (The user wants to redirect all traffic):** This is *precisely* why a VPN is better. If they want to redirect *all* traffic, they *should* choose a VPN.
* **B: Jëfandikukat bi dafay xalaata moytu numu ko mëna censure wala espionage (The user is concerned about censorship or espionage):** The passage implies VPNs are better for avoiding tracking and censorship, so a VPN is preferable here.
* **D: Liggéeyu jëfandikukat bi dafay laaj ab dayoo bande passante bu yem ba ci bu kawe (The user's work requires a limited or high bandwidth allowance):** The passage doesn't give enough information to decide whether proxy or VPN is more bandwidth efficient. Bandwidth is relevant to both.

Lan mooy tax ba kenn mëna jëfandikoo ab telefon këru liggéeyukaay fu bokkul ak seen barab?,"The correct answer is **A: Ay woote yu internet jàllale** (Internet calls forwarding).

The passage clearly states that making calls over the internet eliminates the need for a local phone company and the requirement of having a phone number based on your physical location. This directly answers the question of how someone can use a business phone number different from their actual location.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan lañu wara def ngir jot ci yenn woote yi?","Based on the information in passage P, the best answer is **A: Jënd ab nimero buñuy mëna woote fépp ci adduna** (Buy a number that can be called from anywhere in the world).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that internet calling eliminates the need for a local phone company.
*   It also mentions the possibility of having a satellite connection in one location but a phone number that represents another (e.g., a Chiken, Alaska satellite connection with an Arizona number).
*   This implies that you can obtain a phone number not tied to your physical location, enabling you to receive calls from anywhere.

The other options are incorrect:

*   B: Jëfandikoo ab nimero telefonu këru liggéeyukaay (Use a work phone number): While possible, the passage focuses on the flexibility and lack of geographical restrictions of internet calling, making this less relevant.
*   C: Am ab nimero ci sa askan (Have a number in your country): The passage directly contradicts this by suggesting you *don't* need a local number.
*   D: Jënd ab telefonu PSTN (Buy a PSTN phone): The passage implies that internet calling is an alternative *to* PSTN phones.

Therefore, the most appropriate action based on the passage is to acquire a globally accessible phone number."
Ban ci yile moo dul xamle bu baax niñuy waxee baat yi ci Italien?,"The best answer is **D: Ni ñuy waxee yenn baat yi dafay wuute ci yile voyelle**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that the pronunciation of *c* and *g* depends on the following vowel.** This is exactly what option D describes.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as good:

* **A: Niñ waxee double r dafa wuuteek niñuy waxe benn r** This is true *according to the passage*, but it's not the *most* encompassing statement about pronunciation difficulties.
* **B: Baat yu bari dañ leen di waxee niñ leen bindee** This is true *according to the passage*, but doesn't address the exceptions/difficulties that the passage focuses on.
* **C: Baat yu am arafu c ak g mën nañu doon lu jafe** This is true *according to the passage*, but it's only part of the picture (it's specifically *because* the pronunciation changes based on the vowel that they can be difficult).

Option D captures the core reason *why* certain words in Italian might be difficult to pronounce - the vowel affects the pronunciation. Therefore, it's the most accurate and comprehensive answer.
"
Ban ci yile melokaanu Izmir moo juddoo ci jamono yu bees yi?,"The best answer is **C: Barabi jëndukaay yu mag yi** (Commercial centres).

Here's why:

*   **P says:**""...leegi am barabu jënd ak jaay la bu mengoo ak jamono..."" which translates to ""...now it is a trading place that fits with the times..."" this implies these centres are modern.
*   **Yoon yu yaatu (Wide roads)** Could be both old or new, but not strongly indicative of modern times *in particular.*
*   **Tabax yu am verre ci seen kanam (Buildings with glass fronts)** This is not even explicitly mentioned in the text.
*   **Mbaar yu am tuile yu xonq (Buildings with red tiles)** are described to resemble traditional architecture and not modern.

Therefore, commercial centers are the best answer."
Ban ci yile moo nekkul ab melokaanu Izmir?,"The correct answer is **B: Atmosphère dafay nirook Turque bu yagg ba** (The atmosphere resembles old Turkey).

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states: ""*waaye dêkk bi mediterané lalay gëna jox que que cosaanu Turquie*"" (but the city more Mediterranean than old Turkey). This contradicts option B.

The other options are supported by the text:

*   **A: Dêkk bi dafay wër baie bu yaatu** (The city surrounds a large bay): The text says ""nu def ko mu wër peggu ndoox bu rëy te ay montaañ wër ko"" (it is arranged around a large gulf and surrounded by mountains).
*   **C: Mën nga gis ab bitik yu bees ak ay jangu yu yagg** (You can see new shops and old buildings): The text mentions both modern shopping centers and historical markets, mosques, and churches.
*   **D: Moo am èaareelu port bi gëna mag ci Turkey** (It has the second largest port in Turkey): The text states ""ñaarel jàllalekaay gannaaw Istanbul"" (second largest port after Istanbul)."
Baatu hanami xoolandi wu lan lay juñju?,"The correct answer is **A: Ay tóor-tóoru sëriis**

"

"Suu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile mbiri Jerusalem mooy bi warul mëna xëcc touriste yi?","The correct answer is **B: Statut bumu am niki ak capitaal.**

Here's why:

*   The text mentions that most other countries and the United Nations do not recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. This could be a point of political contention but would not necessarily deter tourists.

The other options are positive attributes that would attract tourists:

*   **A: Solos diiney dëkk bi:** The text emphasizes Jerusalem's importance to three major religions, making it a significant pilgrimage and tourist destination.
*   **C: Yimuy joxe ci wàllu cosaan:** The text mentions that Jerusalem has a rich history and a mix of old-world and modern cultures, making it a valuable destination for culture enthusiasts.

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban xeetu wey-tukki moo dul jariñoo ci njëndum ab Wild Card?","The correct answer is **B: Ab wey-tukki buy dem ci Kruger National Park kese**.

Here's why:

*   The text explains that a Wild Card provides access to multiple parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
*   If someone is *only* going to Kruger National Park, a Wild Card wouldn't be beneficial because they'd be paying for access to parks they won't use.
*   The other options describe scenarios where a Wild Card *would* be useful (visiting multiple SANParks, needing to save on park fees, visiting Kruger plus at least one other park)."
Ban wax moo dul xamle bu baax Kruger National Park?,"The correct answer is **C: Mooy bi gëna tuuti ci Park National yu Afrique du Sud**.

Here's why:

*   **P** states that Kruger National Park encompasses 19,500 square kilometers. The statement does not provide whether this is the smallest Park National in South Africa.

The other options are accurate based on the text:

*   **A:** ""Dañ ko jàppee niki luy xëccaate ci Afrique du Sud"" This is correct because the text says it's seen as the ""flagship"" of South African National Parks (SANParks). The term flagship is used to suggest the park is considered like the most important/symbolic.
*   **B:** ""Allu mala yi dañuy wuute ci biir ay écozones yu bari"" (The wildlife varies within the many ecozones) - This is correct as the text mentions the park is divided into diverse ecozones with varying flora and fauna.
*   **D:** ""Wisit kat yi mên nañ fa dem suñu jëndee ab Wild Card"" (Visitors can go there if they buy a Wild Card) - This is correct as the text explicitly mentions buying a Wild Card as an option for entry."

This is where it can be difficult and they're slippery, especially when wet.

*   **C** is in line with what is mentioned in **P**: ""45 simili Jàllukaay yu xeer lanu teg ci lu ëpp ci yoon wi""
*   **D** is in line with what is mentioned in **P**: ""rawatina bu nu tooyee, ndaxte mën nañoo nekk lu wóoradi""

Because there is no mention of mains courantes in the provided text, the most inconsistent statement is that there are no mains courantes in the steepest sections. Therefore, the answer is **B**."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile mo nekkul ab lekk bu Majorquain di gëna jëfandikoo ci seen togg?","The correct answer is **C: Cereale**

    *   Meat (especially pork/pig)
    *   Bread
    *   Legumes
    *   Olive oil

*   The passage does **not** explicitly mention Cereale as a prominent ingredient in Majorcan cuisine.

Therefore, Cereale is the ingredient that is least likely to be heavily used according to the passage.

Li moo tax **C** mooy li nekkul dëgg."
Ban ci yile lañu limul niki anam buñu gëna xam ci tangal ab teen?,"The correct answer is **A: Gaz**.

The passage mentions ""xeeri daay yu tàng"" (hot rocks) and ""gox bi nekk barab yu am tàngooru geotermik"" (geothermal heat) as sources of heat. It does *not* mention ""gaz"" as a source.
"
Lan mooy mëna waral ab xamee bu xejjiku ci moine wala ab nonne?,"Based on the passage, the following behaviors could lead to a ""rebellious attitude"" from a monk or nun:

*   **B: Muur say mbagg** (Covering your bags). The passage explicitly states that women should cover their bags, implying that not doing so would be unusual and potentially cause disapproval.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Sol ab musoor bu am melo bu fës** (Wearing a brightly colored scarf). While the passage mentions that officials like light-colored scarves, it doesn't imply that wearing one would be considered rebellious by the monks or nuns.

*   **C: Ab musoor ci monastère bi** (A scarf in the monastery). The passage doesn't indicate anything negative about wearing a scarf in general. In fact, women are likely to be given headscarves.

*   **D: Sol ab sipp buy dem ba ci oom yi** (Wearing a zipper that goes to the waist). The passage discusses appropriate skirt lengths but does not specifically mention zippers.
"
Ban ci yile yere mo jàppandiwul ngir ñu àbb ko ci monastère bi? ,"The text describes the dress code for visiting a monastery. Women need to wear long skirts that cover their knees and hide their figures. Men must wear pants that cover their knees. The text states these items can be borrowed at the entrance, but you may not be at peace if you wear your own shorts.

Based on this, the item of clothing that is least appropriate and therefore would need to be borrowed at the monastery is **shorts**.

Therefore, the answer is (A) Sipp. This is because the text emphasizes the importance of covering the knees and not showing the figure.
"
Kan la ab visiteyr am sansu xool ay biddew suy de visité barabi Antarctique yi?,"The best answer is **C: Ci weeru jamonoy sédd yi (In the cold season months)**

Here's why:

*   **The passage describes polar night, which is a period of complete darkness in the Arctic or Antarctic due to the sun not rising. Polar night occurs during the cold season.** This darkness is ideal for viewing stars and auroras.
*   **Option A** (summer months) is incorrect because there is constant daylight in summer in those regions (midnight sun).
*   **Option B** (when the place has fewer people) is partially correct, but the primary factor is the lack of sunlight, not just fewer people.
*   **Option D** (When light pollution is low) is also partially correct but less relevant than the presence of darkness. The best time to see the stars or auroras is during the cold season when the place is dark.

Therefore, C is the most accurate answer based on the information in the passage."
Kan la ñu mënul remplacer ab telefon satellite ak ab telefon portaabal?,"The correct answer is **A: Sudee dañoo wara nëbb liiñ yuñuy jëmale ci sattelite bi**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Mën nañu ni ab téléphone satellite mënul wuutu ab téléphone portable, ndax fàww nga nekk ci biti, fu làquwul ci satellite ngir nga mën ci woote téléphone."" (We can say that a satellite phone cannot replace a mobile phone because you have to be outside, in a place that is not blocked from the satellite in order to make a phone call.)
*   **This means** that if you are trying to use a satellite phone inside to ""nëbb liiñ yuñuy jëmale ci sattelite bi"" (hide the lines being sent to the satellite), it would not work. Therefore, a cell phone could not be used as a substitute to satellite phone in this situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sudee bari dafa sori lool** (If the distance is very far): The passage implies satellite phones are *useful* for long distances (""tukki yu am joxe yu sori"" - travels with long distances).
*   **C: Sudee dañ koy jëfandikoo ci biti** (If they are using it outside): The passage states satellite phones *need* to be used outside.
*   **D: Sudee ab expédition dafay laaj yenn données yuñu soxla** (If an expedition requires certain data they need): The passage doesn't directly relate data needs to *not* replacing a satellite phone."
Kañ la lañuy mëna tànn ab telefon sattelite bayyi fi ab telefon portaabal?,"The correct answer is **B: Sooy tukki ci bato** (When you are traveling by boat).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that satellite phones are useful in situations where you don't have a mobile network. Traveling by boat often means being far from land and cellular towers, making a satellite phone a more reliable option.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: Sooy dem wakans ci ab dëkk (When you go on vacation in a city):** Cities usually have strong mobile network coverage.
*   **C: Sudee soxla wuñu ay données yu sori (If you don't need remote data):** This isn't a primary reason to choose a satellite phone over a mobile phone.
*   **D: Sooy melni kuy am couverture telefon portaabal bu baax (When you seem to have good mobile phone coverage):** If you have good mobile coverage, there's no need for a satellite phone."
Ab ñakka deggoo bi nga xamantane bii dafay waral ñu sos ab Republic transltionnel?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: Waaso**.

The text explicitly states that Moldova is a country with many ethnic groups that experience severe ethnic conflicts. This is what led to the creation of the Republic of Transnistria.
"
Ban ci yile da République bu Transnistria am bu wuuteek li des ci Moldavie?  ,"The correct answer is **D: Xaalis** (Currency).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Transnistria has ""nguuram ak xaalisu boppam,"" meaning its own government and currency. The other options aren't correct.

*   Lakk (Language): The passage says the most spoken language in Moldova is Russian, but it doesn't imply that Transnistria speaks a different language.
*   Diine (Religion): The passage says the dominant religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christian; it doesn't mention religion as a difference between Moldova and Transnistria.
*   Reconnaissance bu NU (UN Recognition): The passage explicitly says that no country, even in the UN, recognizes Transnistria. This means that this is the reason Transnistria is different from Moldova, because Moldova is recognized.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kañ la ab wey-tukki wara jot ab wisitu Montevideo su yaakaaare moytu ngelaw yi?","The text says that Montevideo is cold when the northern hemisphere is hot and hot when the northern hemisphere is cold. The question asks when to visit Montevideo to AVOID the cold winds. Therefore, you should visit when the northern hemisphere is cold (which is the hot season in Montevideo).

So the answer is: **A: Ci jamonoy sédd yu weeri Hemisphère Nord**
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kañ la ab wey-tukki wara dem Montevideo sudee dañoo and ci climat bu sédd?","The passage states:

*   ""Ginaaw Montevideo mingi ci bëj-saalumu equateur bi, su bëj-gànnaar gi tàngee ñoom ñu sedd, su ci kaw séddee ñoom ñu tàng."" This means that when the Northern Hemisphere is hot, Montevideo is cold, and when the Northern Hemisphere is cold, Montevideo is hot.
*   ""Montevideo ci diiwaan yu nekk ci suuf toropik bi la nekk, ci weeri été yi, tamperatiir yuy weesu +30°ñC dañuy faral di bari."" This means that in the summer, temperatures often exceed +30°C.
*   ""Seddaayu Hiver mën na nax ñu bari: néewna lu température yi di wàcci lu yées zero degré"" It is rare for temperature to fall below zero degree during winter.

If someone wants to go to Montevideo when the climate is cold, they should go when the Northern Hemisphere is hot (summer).

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Su été bi jotee ci Hemisphère Nord**"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile lañu wara boole ak ab fentkatu graffiti, wuuteek yëfu bandit?","The correct answer is **C: Peinture ci miir yuñu jagleel askan wi** (Painting on walls dedicated to the public).

Here's why:

*   The passage contrasts undesirable graffiti (associated with vandalism and illegible tags) with legitimate graffiti art.
*   The passage mentions ""ay fentkati garaffiti yu fa sanc"" (established graffiti artists) who ""bayyi ginnaaw ay etiket yuñu mënul jang"" (leave behind illegible tags). This implies that legitimate graffiti artists create artwork that is understandable and visually appealing.
*   ""Peinture ci miir yuñu jagleel askan wi"" (Painting on walls dedicated to the public) suggests a sanctioned space for artistic expression, which aligns with the idea of legitimate graffiti art.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Xew-xewi Graffiti** (Graffiti events) - While graffiti events might involve legitimate artists, the events themselves are not a defining characteristic that separates an artist from a vandal.
*   **B: Jaxase** (Mixture) - This doesn't relate to what differentiates a graffiti artist from a vandal.
*   **D: Balises yuñu mënul jang** (Illegible tags) - The passage explicitly states that legitimate graffiti artists *don't* leave illegible tags. This is a characteristic of the undesirable graffiti associated with vandalism."
Yan xeeti festivalu misig la yenn nit yuy teew di jappee ni lu manta ñakk ci seen jaar-jaar?,"The correct answer is **B: Def camping ci barab bi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""li ëpp ci way-fekkee yi ci festiwaalu misik yi dañuy decidé campé ci si bi, te way-fekkee yu ci ëpp dañ koy jàppee xaaj bu am solo ci luñuy dundu"" which translates to ""most attendees at music festivals decide to camp at the site, and most attendees consider it an important part of their experience.""

The other options are mentioned in the passage, but are not presented as an essential part of the experience for *most* attendees:
* **A: Indi say doom** is mentioned in the passage, but it only applies to some families.
* **C: Teg misig ci guddi gi** is also mentioned, but it refers to the activities in general rather than a crucial part of attendees' experience.
* **D: Teela aksi** (Arriving early) is mentioned as a strategy to secure a good camping spot, not as part of the overall experience."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan kuy dem ci fesval gëna jox gëdd su bëggee compé ci wetu misig bi?","The correct answer is **D: Teela aksi** (Arrive early).

The passage states: ""Soo bëggee jege jëf ji dina laaj nga teela jog ngir am ab camping bi ngay dàl bu jegge misig bi"" which translates to: ""If you want to be close to the action, it will require you to arrive early in order to get a campsite that is close to the music.""
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, fan visiteur yi wara moytu suñuy wut dundu guddi ci bëj-saalumu Nouveau Mexique?","The correct answer is **B: Baaru dëkk bu ndaw**.

The passage explicitly warns: ""Bayyil xel: baar yu nekk ci gox yu ndàw yi duñuy faral di baax ngir ñiy wisit ci bitim réew ngir dem fa."" This translates to: ""Be careful: bars in small towns are usually not good for foreign visitors to go to.""
"
Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi fan la ab visiteur gênee mëna gis ay po yuñu xam bu baax ci bëj-saalumu Nouveau Mexique?,"The passage states that casinos offer drinks and ""many of them bring in famous acts (usually those who are longer established and tour Albuquerque and Santa Fe).""  It also mentions the pueblos have casinos.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: Ci ab casino ñaari waxtu bawoo Albuquerque** (In a casino two hours from Albuquerque). This aligns with the text's implication that casinos outside the major cities host well-known acts and that these casinos are associated with the pueblos.
"
Way-tukki yuy xalaat seen budget war nañu bëgg a moytu ban xeetu naan?,"The passage states that ""ndoxi firiwi yi dañoo seer waaye dañoo neex lool"" which translates to ""fruit juices are expensive but very good"".

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: Jus de fruits** (Fruit juices)
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci barab buñu xamle ci xët bi, ban ci yile naan lañu mëna jaawatle ak seveur?","The correct answer is **B: Ab Nimero Un**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Sàngaara bu nu gëna jëfandikoo gi mooy ‘Number One’"" which translates to ""The most used alcohol is 'Number One'"". This directly translates to ""Ab Nimero Un""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nuwaar bu gatt:** ""Nuwaar bu gatt"" translates to a short noir. Nothing in the text mentions to serve this
*   **C: Ab Sauvignon bu Weex bu New Zealand:** The text mentions that New Zealand wines travel well, but doesn't suggest specifically serving a Sauvignon Blanc.
*   **D: Ab weex bu tàcc:** ""Ab weex bu tàcc"" translates to a sparkling white, there is no mention of serving sparkling wine in the passage."
"Ci diirup ñetti siyeekal, diiru kolonisasioŋ bi ban kuréel moo ko tambali woon?","The correct answer is **D: The Spaniards**.

The text clearly states: ""Spaniards yi dooronnagnu diirruk nootél bi nékkon ci gnetti xarnu."" which translates to ""The Spaniards started the period of colonization that lasted three centuries.""
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan mooy anam bi gën ngir fexe ba ab parisien tangal sa yaram?","The correct answer is **C: Nekk ku yaru (Be polite)**.

The passage states: ""anam bi gëna baax ngir deggoo ca Paris mooy ba tey ci sa doxaliin bi gën, di jëfee niki nit ku yaru lool"" which translates to ""the best way to get along in Paris is to be well-behaved in your approach, acting like a very polite person."" This directly supports the idea of being polite.

"
Lan mooy awantaasu Première Classe ci MétroRail bu Cape Town?,"The correct answer is **C: Moo gëna yomb tieketu Troisième Classe**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""ker MetroPlus moo gëna neex te bariwul nit wante dafa xawaa seer, doonte moo gëna yomb ba léegi tike metro ci Ëropë"". This translates to ""MetroPlus is more comfortable and less crowded but is a bit more expensive, even though it is still the cheapest metro ticket in Europe"". Since MetroPlus is being compared to other ticket options in Europe, we can infer that it is more affordable than other ticket classes, which makes it cheaper than third class tickets.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan moo nekk ci otoraay banlieu bu nekk?","The correct answer is **B: Benn njëgu tiket ngir ñaari classes yi**.

Here's why:

* **P** states ""Train bu ci nekk dafa am ay autocar MetroPlus ak Metro"" (Each train has MetroPlus and Metro coaches). This means there are two classes.
* **P** implies that MetroPlus is more expensive (""dafa xawaa seer""), indicating different prices for the two classes.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A:** The passage says MetroPlus is ""bariwul nit"" (not crowded), not the whole metro.
* **C & D:** The passage only mentions MetroPlus and Metro, implying two classes, not three or specifically a first and third class.
"
Ban ci yile jëf la ab mala bu am feebar warul mêna def?,"D'après le passage, on dit que les maladies portées par les animaux peuvent causer des infections. Les autres options (donner des piqûres, causer des allergies, causer des blessures graves) ne sont pas mentionnées directement dans le passage comme étant liées aux maladies portées par les animaux.

Donc la réponse correcte est:

C: Wasaare ab infection (Wasaare ab infection = Propager une infection)
"
Fan lañuy mëna jëndee ak kartu telefon yuñu fay ba noppi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ci bitiku koñ bi** (In the corner store).

The passage states: ""Bëpp rukk ci bitik bi da fess ak alluwa yu jaxasso ak kaart telefon buñu faay bapare..."" which translates to ""Every corner store is full of assorted items and prepaid phone cards...""
"
Nan lañuy jotee ci njëgi woote yu gëna yomb ci yenn kart yi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ci ay nimero yodul fay**.

The passage explicitly states that you can access these services through toll-free numbers (""jot ci sàrwiis yii ci ab nimero bu amul fay""). Therefore, B is the answer.

"
"Soo aksee ci sa réewum cosaan, ban doxaliin mooy faral di nekk lu informel?","The correct answer is **D: Saytug douane (Customs inspections)**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt (P) describes potential issues with customs inspections, both when leaving and arriving in a country.** It advises being aware of what you can and cannot bring and to declare everything legally required.
* **The question (Q) asks about a procedure that is often informal upon returning to your home country.** While immigration (A) and legal processes (C) are often formal, customs inspections (D) can sometimes be more relaxed or informal for returning citizens, especially if they don't appear to be carrying large quantities of goods. Declarations (B) are a part of the customs process, not an informal process themselves.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is customs inspections.
"
Yan ci yile nga wara xam laata nga aksi ci sa réewum cosaan?,"Answer D, ""Ndax amul lenn ci li ngay indaale lu ñuy tere,"" is the best answer. Here's why:

* **The Prompt's Focus:** The prompt specifically mentions understanding what you *can* and *cannot* bring into a country and being compliant with the law.
* **Why Other Options Are Less Correct:**
    * **A: Su naree am ab barabu saytug imigarasioŋ (If there is a place for immigration control):** While related to travel, immigration control is more about your right to enter and stay, not directly about what you can bring with you.
    * **B: So waree xamle mbir yi ci yemaley yoon (If you need to declare things according to the law):** This is related, but incomplete. The core issue is *knowing* what's prohibited, not just knowing you need to declare things.
    * **C: Su naree am ay saytug douane (If there are customs controls):**  Similar to A and B, knowing that customs exists isn't the primary concern. It's knowing what *is* and *isn't* allowed through customs.

**In summary:** The passage emphasizes knowing prohibited items. Option D directly addresses that.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, bariwaayu lu tax yeegkat yi gis lu bari ay yoon yu ees ci biir Cochamó Valley?","The correct answer is **D: Ay miir** (Walls).

The passage states that Cochamó Valley is known for its ""ay mur ak xeer yu mag"" (large walls and rocks) and that climbers are looking for new routes to climb the ""mur yu bari yi nekk ci tund yi"" (many walls on the mountains). Therefore, the abundance of walls is the reason climbers are finding new routes.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xibaar yuñu joxe ci xët bi, kan mooy jiite jeggi yu gëna mag ci Hemisphère Nord?","Answer: None of the provided answers are correct.

The passage does not mention who leads in the Northern Hemisphere. The passage focuses on the Southern Hemisphere and the difficulties in traveling there."
Ban alliance tukkib asamaan mo am ay jeggi yu gëna neew ci ocean bi ci Hemisphère Sud?,"The passage explicitly states that Star Alliance flies everywhere except in the Southeast Pacific, from Santiago, Chile to Tahiti, where LATAM Oneworld flies. It also says SkyTeam doesn't operate any transoceanic flights in the Southern Hemisphere. Therefore, Star Alliance has the fewest gaps (most routes) among the airline alliances listed in the Southern Hemisphere.

So the answer is A.
"
Ban nosug tukki moo wuuti Global Running Tours?,"The correct answer is **B: Go Running Tours**.

The passage states: ""Kiy wuutu ci Global Running Tours, Go Running Tours amalna ay fukk ak ñaar yu beeri ñuy amal saytu ci ñénti kembaar yi."" which translates to ""Taking over Global Running Tours, Go Running Tours has dozens of tours in four continents."". This directly indicates that Go Running Tours took over Global Running Tours.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, Go Running Tours dafay tax ñu mêna lëkkale ay nosukaayi sightrunning yu bari?","The answer is **C: Ay douzaine** (A dozen).

The passage states: ""Kiy wuutu ci Global Running Tours, Go Running Tours amalna ay fukk ak ñaar yu beeri ñuy amal saytu ci ñénti kembaar yi.""  ""Ay fukk ak ñaar"" directly translates to ""a dozen"".
"

"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban xeetu mala ab visiteur buñu mëna taseel sooy dem sorti wu safari ci ab ndamar?","The correct answer is **C: Ségg yi**.

The passage states ""Ay gayndé, cheetahs ak ay ségg yénn say dagniy tooy, bugnu nékké gnaar ngalén di geenee gis,"" which translates to ""Lions, cheetahs, and zebras are sometimes shy, so you're more likely to see them in pairs."" This confirms that zebras are animals you might encounter on a safari trip in the bush.

While lions and cheetahs can be seen, the passage suggests they might be harder to spot. There's no mention of ""ñamala yi"" (presumably meaning some kind of antelope) in the passage.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan mooy mëna waññi njëgu ab wisit?","The correct answer is **B: Wut kuréel bu am ñeenti nit (Find a group of four people)**.

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""...jéemal dajé ak yénéénni nit té nas bénn kuréllu gnént japp juroom bénn ngir xayma nit bu geen."" This translates to: ""...try to meet other people and form a group of four to five people to reduce the cost per person.""

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Demal sa bopp (Go alone):** The passage suggests joining a group to reduce costs, not going alone.
*   **C: Dem ak beneen nit (Go with one other person):** The passage specifically mentions forming a group of four to five people.
*   **D: Wut kuréel bu am juróomi nit wala luko ëpp (Find a group of five people or more):** This is a valid strategy based on the passage, but the best option given is B, which is to find a group of four.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kan moo wara mën àar jëgi wisit yi?","The correct answer is **B: Ab kuréelu ñett**.

Here's why:

* The passage in P advises people traveling alone or in pairs to join groups of ""three to five"" to avoid being singled out and potentially overcharged. This implies that being in a group of three provides some protection against this practice."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan moo gëna taxoon ñu raññee Francisco ci addina bi?","The correct answer is **A: Ab teewaayu xaritoo ci ay xeeti fent yu bari ak ci mejaa yi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Liñ koy faral di wone ci misik, filmu yi, literaatir ak cosaan yu siiw tax na bañu xàm dëkk bi ak ay monimaa wam ci addina bi."" (What is often shown in music, films, literature and famous heritage makes the city and its monuments known throughout the world.) This clearly indicates that its presence in various forms of art and media is a significant reason for San Francisco's global recognition.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **B: Barabi defukaayu congrés yu am maana:** While the text mentions congress centers, it's not presented as the primary reason for its global fame.
*   **C: Wuute gi am ci koom bi:** The text discusses San Francisco's economy, but not specifically as the reason for its global recognition.
*   **D: Ab xeetu togg bu bawoo Asie bu nekk di siiw bu baax:** While the text mentions diverse Asian cuisine, it's not the main factor driving San Francisco's fame according to the passage."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile wax yu àju ci San Francisco mo nekkul dëgg?","The correct answer is **D: Mbooleen koom gi mu ngi àju ci tourisme (The whole economy depends on tourism).**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that tourism is a *major* sector of the economy, along with other sectors like government, finance, trade, and services. It doesn't say that the *entire* economy is based on tourism.
*   The passage clearly states the other options.

Therefore, option D is the statement that is NOT true based on the passage."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban xeetu tukkikat moo warul jariñoo ci jëfandikoo ay sàrwiisi tukkikat?","Jaŋ bi waxatul ci tukkikat yi warul jariñoo ci sàrwiisu tukkikat. Nii lañu wax ci lu tukkikat bi mën a jariñoo ci jëfandikoo sàrwiisu tukkikat. Dal xalaat boobu, kenn ci li war la woon bu saxul.
"
Yan ci yile lañu limul ci xët bi niki ab njuréef jàpp palaas ci ab ndawal këru tukki?,"The correct answer is **D: Yore ab reservation**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Jàpp palaas ci njëlbeen dafax may aji-tukki bi jàmm ci xel ni dina ñu am fenn fuñuy nelawee suñu àgee fiñu jëm."" This directly translates to the benefit of having peace of mind knowing you have a place to stay when you arrive, which is essentially having a reservation.

Let's look at why the other options are not the primary benefit described:

*   **A: Ay wayndare tukki yuñu gaawal (Discounted travel rates)**: While travel agents *might* get discounts, the passage doesn't emphasize this as the main benefit of booking accommodation through them.

*   **B: Ay jaayum otel (Hotel sales)**: Travel agents don't sell hotels, they offer reservations at different hotels.

*   **C: Ay forfait yu boole lépp (All-inclusive packages)**: The passage mentions that travel agencies *sometimes* offer things like breakfast or airport transfers, but this is not the core benefit related to booking accommodation in advance. The focus is on securing a place to stay."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan la jëfekaayu tekki lakki ci lu gaaw la lañu mënul def?","The correct answer is **D: Tekki bu baax 100% ci temps bi** (Translate perfectly 100% of the time).

Here's why:

* The text in P explicitly states that while translation technology has improved, it can still make mistakes (""ak tuuti ci yu bonn""). This means it doesn't provide perfect translations every time.
* The other options (A, B, and C) are all things the text says translation applications *can* do."
Lan mooy tax ñu mëna def ay tekki fu amul net?,"The correct answer is **C: Yebbi ay données wu lakk** (Downloading language data).

Here's why:

* The prompt discusses applications that can translate text in real-time. To function offline (without internet access), these applications **must** have the language data (dictionaries, grammar rules, etc.) downloaded and stored locally on the device. This allows the app to perform translations even without a network connection.
"
Ban ci yile moo nekkul luy dekkal ay avalanche?,"Based on the provided text:

*   **P describes avalanches.** It describes them as starting slowly and then becoming larger (like a flood).
*   It mentions triggers like:
    *   Ice collecting and needing to be dislodged
    *   Sun heating the snow
    *   Falling snow
    *   Other natural events

Therefore:

*   **A (Neige bu kolé - Icy snow):** Is part of the problem that leads to avalanches.
*   **C (Fentug naaj - Solar radiation):** Is mentioned as one of the initial conditions
*   **D (Yeneen waccug neige - Other snow falling):** Is mentioned as one of the initial conditions
*   **B (Nit ñi - People):** Is not mentioned in the text as a trigger.

**So the answer is B: Nit ñi**
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile mooy wàcc niki ay avanlanche?","Based on the text provided, the correct answer is:

**A: Neige buy kolé buñu dekkalul (Snow that's icy if not melted)**

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Jafe jafe bi mooy galas dafay kole, kon soxlana ñu laal ko ngir mu wàcc"" which translates to ""The problem is the ice freezes, so it needs to be touched to fall"".
*   The text also says ""...te tuuti galas suy wàcc mën na yóbbaale yi des"" which translates to ""... and a little ice that falls can carry away what's left"". This implies that even a small amount of icy snow falling can trigger a larger event, similar to an avalanche.

The other options are less accurate because:

*   **B: Ay pente yu jub yu amul neige (Steep slopes without snow):** Avalanches cannot occur if there is no snow.
*   **C: Bariwaay neige ci pente yu jub yi (Abundance of snow on steep slopes):** While a lot of snow can contribute to avalanches, the key factor described in the text is the presence of icy snow (""galas dafay kole"").
*   **D: Neige bu nit ñi laalul (Snow that people haven't touched):** The text says the opposite, that it needs to be touched to trigger falling of the ice."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, curry ci ay ingrédient la jogé?","The correct answer is **B: Ñax ak épices** (Herbs and spices).

The passage states: ""Curry ak gnamla bugnu défaré ay **gnax ak ay kaani**..."" which translates to ""Curry is a dish prepared with **herbs and spices**...""
"
"Ci yenn diiwaan yi, meewu koko luñuy j¨fandikoo la ci barabu ban ingrédient ci ab curry?","Correct answer: **C: Yawuur**

**Explanation:**

The passage states:

*   ""Ci gox yi féete ci bët gànnaaru Inde ak Pakistan, dañuy faral di jëfandikoo **soow** ci kari yi"" (In the northern parts of India and Pakistan, they often use **dairy** in curries).

*   ""ci bëj saalumu Inde ak ci yeneen gox yu jege géej gi ci ronu-gox bi, ñoom **ndoxu coco** lañu faral di jëfandikoo."" (In southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, they often use **coconut milk**).

The question asks what **coconut milk** is used *instead* of. Therefore, coconut milk replaces **dairy**, which is used in the northern regions.

**Yawuur** is a type of dairy.
"
Lu tax ñuy wara wër Montaañu Transantarctique yi ngir àgg ci plateaux yu?,"The correct answer is **A: Station bu McMurdo Station dafay faral di tej (McMurdo Station is often closed).**

Here's why:

* **Passage P describes a 1,600 km tractor route that connects McMurdo Station to the South Pole, across glacial ice.** This implies McMurdo is a crucial starting/ending point.
* **Passage P states this route goes *around* (has ""turns"") mountains connecting Antarctica to the ""asset"" (likely the South Pole).**
* **If McMurdo Station is *often closed* (A), that would explain why one might need to travel AROUND a mountain range in the first place.** This aligns perfectly with the need to circumvent a potentially impassable or closed area.

The other options are less directly related to the passage:

* **B: Neige bu jàpp bi dafa wóoradi (Snow is slippery).** Slippery snow would make tractor travel difficult, but not necessarily warrant a detour AROUND mountains. The passage implies the route is usable with tractors.
* **C: Tracteur yu xarañ yi nooyi wuñu (Tractors are not fast).** Tractor speed is irrelevant. They still need to get from point A to point B. The slow speed doesn't explain why mountains are bypassed.
* **D: Moo gën yomb tukki jëm Mer Rose (It is easier to travel towards the Ross Sea).** The Ross Sea is where McMurdo station is located. Passage P explicitly says the route is between the two locations and goes *around* the mountains, not towards.
"
"Ci jeggikaayu Pôle Sud, lan lañu mandargaal ay drapeau?","The correct answer is **C: Crevasse yu fees dell ak neigne**.

The passage states that the road is through ""galaas gu konsaale la ak ay pax yu nu sol te màndargaal ko ak darapoo,"" which translates to ""consolidated ice with covered crevasses that are marked with flags."" Therefore, the flags are used to mark crevasses.
"
Lan lañu bindul ci xët bi niki lu touriste yi wara xam suñuy dem ci xaaj bi féete Afrique du Sud?,"The correct answer is **C: Mën nañu wax ni réew yépp yu jege Afrique du Sud dañoo am dal** (We cannot say that all the countries near South Africa are peaceful).

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""...waaye réew yi ko wër melu ñu noonu"" which translates to ""but the countries surrounding it (South Africa) are not the same (peaceful)."" This directly contradicts option C.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

*   **A: Réew yu bari dañoo am ay càkkutéefi Visas yu wuute** (Many countries have different visa requirements) - The passage mentions ""Li nga wara fay ngir am visa mingi aju ci réew mi nga joge, benn réew bokkul ak moroom ma."" (What you have to pay to get a visa depends on the country you come from, one country is not like the other).
*   **B: Dem fa ak woto anam bu baax la ngir visiter barab yi ci sentier battus yi** (Going there with a car is a good way to visit places off the beaten path) - The passage states ""Dugg ci bëj-saalumu Afrik ci ab ndambaar anam mënul ñakk la ngir gis rafetaayu diiwaan yi te dina tax nga dem ci barab yi nga xamantane nekku ñu ci yoonu turist yi."" (Going to Southern Africa by car is essential to see the beauty of the region and it will allow you to go to places that are not on tourist routes.)
*   **D: Ab 4x4 lañu digle sooy tukki ab woto** (A 4x4 is recommended for traveling by car) - The passage states ""ab 4x4 lañu digle bu baax te barab yu bari ndaamaru 4x4 bu am ay pono yu mag lañ fa mëna duggee"" (a 4x4 is highly recommended and in many places only 4x4 vehicles with high clearance can enter)."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan lañuy wara jàppee niki ab tektal bu bon ngir touriste yuy jéema dem Afrique du Sud ak woto?","The correct answer is **D: Du réew yu jege Afrique du Sud yépp ñoo baax ngir dem wisit** (Not all countries bordering South Africa are safe to visit).

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Su ngeen di waajal bàyyi leen xel ni naan Afrique ostraal amna jàmm, waaye réew yi ko wër melu ñu noonu."" This translates to ""When preparing, keep in mind that Southern Africa is peaceful, but the countries surrounding it are not the same."" This directly implies that not all neighboring countries are safe to visit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yoon mën naa laaj woto bi am ay mbiru saafara su amee lu jamp ci woto bi** The passage talks about countries having different rules for what's needed in a travel vehicle, but doesn't specify if it could be something related to health if anything goes wrong with the vehicle.
*   **B: Donte ab digle wuñu ab 4x4, mën nañu dem ci barab yu bari ci ab ndamar bu jaadu** While the passage does mention a regular vehicle can be used, it recommends a 4x4 to see a lot of the region.
*   **C: Tukki ci ab woto lu baax la ci ñuy jéma bayyi yoon yuñuy faral di gis** The text mentions that travelling with a car is a good way to see regions outside of typical tourist routes, making the reverse of this sentence the only truth."
Ban ci yile lañu limul ci xët bi niki ab mbir mu wóoradi nga teg say bagaas to xoolu lo leen?,"Based on the text provided, here's the breakdown of why the answer is:

*   **A: Mën nañ leen sàcc (They can be stolen)** - The text explicitly states, ""Gafa gu kénn xaarul meenagnuko sacc"" which translates to ""Bags that are unattended can be stolen"".
*   **B: Mën nga doon kuy yore dorog te do ko xam (You can become someone who carries drugs without knowing)** - The text also mentions ""Mën nga nekk ndaw lu ñu jox drogue ngir mu yóbbu ko te doo ci xam dara"" meaning ""You might become someone they gave drugs to without you knowing"".
*   **D: Njiit yi mên nañ leen jappee nit ab dankaafu bomb (The authorities might consider them to be carrying a bomb)** - The text states ""njiit yi meennagnu xalaat ni ay ndéll la"" meaning ""authorities might think you are a bearer of bombs"".

*   **C: Mën nañ leen jawale ak bosu keneen (They can be confused with someone else's suitcase)** - This option is NOT mentioned in the provided text.

Therefore, **the correct answer is C: Mën nañ leen jawale ak bosu keneen**."
Lan lañu limul ci xët bi ci wàllu yore dorog?,"The correct answers are **B** and **C**.

Here's why:

*   **B: Da nga wara bayyi xel bu baax sooy tukki dem bitim-réew (You must pay close attention when traveling abroad)** - The passage starts with a warning about baggage and potential drug trafficking, emphasizing the need for vigilance while traveling.

*   **C: Mën nañu jëfandikoo ay xaj yuy xeeñcu dorog te duñ la ko yëgël (Drug-sniffing dogs can be used without your knowledge)** - The passage explicitly mentions the use of drug-sniffing dogs without prior notice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ci yenn réew yi, mën nañu tëj jalgatikat yu ndaw yi sa giiru dundu (In some countries, young offenders can be imprisoned for life)** - The passage mentions severe penalties, including lengthy prison sentences (over 10 years) or even death, but it doesn't specifically state life imprisonment for young offenders.
*   **D: Njiit yi mën nañu nangu say bagaas, donte yoru loo ci dorog (Authorities can confiscate your luggage, even if you don't have drugs in it)** - While the passage mentions that authorities might think you're a thief even if you haven't stolen anything, it doesn't say that authorities might confiscate your luggage if you don't have drugs in it.

"
Ban xeetu naan lañu limul niki luñu wara jéema def ci kër gi ci jamono ji ngay fay nekk?,"The passage mentions the following drinks:

*   **Kafe** (coffee) in the morning
*   **Ataaya chamomile** (chamomile tea) at night
*   **Suu** (juice) or smoothie

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Kafé**, **D: Ataaya**, and **A: Jus**

However, the question asks which of the above answer options are mentioned in the passage as drinks one should try at home during moments of relaxation. So the best answer would be:

*   **B: Kafé**
*   **D: Ataaya**
*   **A: Jus**"
Ban ci yile nga wara dem ci jamono ji nga fay nekk sudee dañoo xamee dëkk bi ci cosaanu naan?,"The correct answer is **C: Pub yi nga dul faral di dem**.

Here's why:

*   The passage (P) explicitly recommends ""Soo dëkkee ci ab gox bu bari ak cosaani naan, demal ci barabi naanukaay yi ak pub yi nekk ci koñ bi nga daanul faral di dem."" which translates to: ""If you live in an area with a lot of drink culture, go to the breweries and pubs in the area that you don't usually go to.""

The other options are not mentioned as the best places to go when exploring the drinking culture of a new city:

*   A: Bitiku kafe yi ci biti barab yi bi nga dëkk (Coffee shops outside where you live) - The text mentions coffee for routine or comfort, not exploring drink culture.
*   B: Mangasinu jus wala kereem (Juice or cream store) - Not relevant to exploring a city's drinking culture.
*   D: Restaurant yuy defar ay ataaya camomille (Restaurants that make chamomile tea) - Chamomile tea is for relaxation, not exploring drink culture."
Fan la picc yuñuy sculpté yi nekk?,"The correct answer is **B: Ci jangu bi**.

The passage states: ""Ci ëttu jàngu bi, am na ay yàttu naat yu nu defar ak marbre..."" which translates to ""In the school hall, there are sculpted marble birds...""
"
Ban xeetu visa ñooy wara laaj nga firndeel ni am nga xaalis bu doy bu lay mëna yor?,"The correct answer is **D: Visa ndongo**

The text explicitly states: ""Lu eepp ci rééw yi, dinga soxla gnu mayla bataxal bu bayiko ci daara yinga beegee jangé, **ak luy firdé say koppar ngir faye sa at bu njeekk**.""

This means that for student visas, you often need to prove you have enough money to cover your first year.
"
Kan moo mo wara soxla visa bu yàgg?,"The correct answer is **C: Ab ndongo buy jangee bitim-réew**.

The text explicitly states that students studying abroad (""ndongo buy jangee bitim-réew"") often require longer stays than typical tourists and therefore need a visa. The passage even details the specific requirements for student visas.
"
Kañ nga wara bayyi xel bu baax ci yoo yi?,"The passage mentions that you should be wary of bees when entering the forest, especially subtropical forests during rain. The most encompassing and relevant answer from the options is:

* **C: Ci àllu tropical bi** (In the tropical forest)

While driving is mentioned, the *type* of forest is the key factor highlighted for being cautious about bees in this context. Option C directly addresses this.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan nga wara baña def ngir moytu yoo yi sooy dawal ci àllu tropical bi?","The correct answer is **A: Bayyi ndamar bi mu ubbeku lu yàgg** (Leave the car door open for a long time).

The passage says opening the door even slightly (two centimeters) is enough for ticks to get into the car.  Therefore, leaving it open longer would increase the risk of ticks entering.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile wax yu àju ci Sundarbans moo nekkul dëgg?","The correct answer is **D: Dafay dalall ay cerf yu taq yu ëpp ay seggi Bengal**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Sundarbans is home to approximately 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer. Since 30,000 is much greater than 400, the passage indicates there are more deer than tigers. Therefore, statement D is false (or ""nekku dëgg"").
*   The other answer options are true according to the passage.
*   A: The passage does mention that the forest also consists of ""giant mangrove trees,"" making it one of few remaining.
*   B: ""3 850km², bi nga xam ne ñett yoo jël benn ban dox moo ko wër/diwaanu deeg"" is equal to about 1,280 km².
*   C: The passage explicitly states that Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world."
Ban xaaj ci àll bi moo nekk ci diiwaanu Ind?,"The correct answer is **A: Park National yu Sundarbans**.

The passage states: ""Wàllu àll bi bokk ci réewum Inde lañuy woowe park national bu Sundarbans yi."" (The part of the forest in India is called Sundarbans National Park.)
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kan mooy wara nekk ku am gën gaa neew ab ñakk deggub lakkum angale bu doy?","The answer is **D: Nit yu magget yi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""Réew yu mag yu bari dañoo dégg Angale bu baax, te ci lu ko gëna bari mën nga yaakaar xam-xam bu yemamaay ci ñi gëna nekk xale."" Which means ""Many big countries understand English well, and in most cases, you can expect a reasonable amount of knowledge among the younger people."" This implies that older people are less likely to know English well."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan mo mën nekk lu jafe wax?","The correct answer is **A: Baat yu am ay accent yu wuute** (Words with different accents).

The passage mentions that spoken words can sometimes be harder to understand than written words, and it gives the example of people from different English-speaking cities (Manchester, Boston, Jamaica, Sydney) meeting in Toronto. They might have trouble understanding each other due to their different accents.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban anam mo wara baax ci tukkikat yuy waaj ngir jël ab kaar ci arrêt kaaru biir gox yii?","The best answer is **B: Tukikat bi mu ngi dem Bumthang te dafa wara joge foofu fi ak 7i waxtu**. Here's why:

*   **The paragraph indicates buses to Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.** If the traveler wants to depart in 7 hours from that time, meaning they would need to get a ticket in advance, it is important to note.

Let's analyze the other options:

*   **A: Tukkikat bi mu ngi dem Jakar te jënd na ab tiket ba noppi ci njëlbéen:** If the ticket is purchased in advance it is more likely the traveler can secure transportation from the bus station.
*   **C: Tukkikat bi mu ngi dem Paro te war na génn su 11 weeso:** The text says shared taxis are good for short distances like Paro. The traveler is unlikely to get a seat in the station buses.
*   **D: Tukkikat bi mu ngi dem penku te dina aksi ci arrêt bi laata 6:20:** The paragraph says buses depart from 06:30. This traveler would arrive early.

**Therefore, option B is the most logical choice based on the information provided in the paragraph.**"
Lan moo wara doon ak tektal bu baax ngir ab touriste buy jéema tukki jëm penku bawoo ci arrêt kaar bu nekk ci biir gox bi?,"The best advice for a tourist traveling east from a bus stop within the country is **B: Jënd ab tiket ci njëlbéen (Buy a ticket in advance)**.

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Ndéem daamar yiy daw ci dëkk yi dañuy fees, li gën mooy nga jàpp paas ay bés laata."" which translates to ""Because the buses that drive in the city always get full, it is best to reserve your ticket a few days earlier.""
*   While buses depart throughout the day (C), the most popular ones for the east leave early. Therefore, getting a ticket in advance is crucial to secure a seat.
*   Shared taxis are good for shorter distances, not necessarily for traveling east (D)."
Ban ci yile mo nekkul luy tax ñu xam Tombouctou?,"The answer is **C: Roplaan mënu fa dem**.

Here's why:

*   **P states:** ""Ginaaw bi """"Tombouctou"""" nekk dëkk bu jafee dem, doon na jëmuwaay bu baax ngir ñiy wut lu sori wala lu bees ci seeni bët."" This indicates it was historically difficult to reach, but doesn't say planes cannot get there.
*   **P states:** ""Tey, Timbuktu ab gox bu neew doole la..."" This supports B (Neew doole la).
*   **P states:** ""...donte niñ ko xàmee mooy tax mu doon luy xëcc turist yi..."" This supports D (Dafay wey di xëcc touriste yi).
*   **P states:** ""Dëkk bii wuutena lool ay yeneen dëkk yi ci réew, ndax dëkku arab la gëna nuru dëkku Afrique."" This means it has a greater arab influence, supporting A (Moo ëppale influence Arab li des ci réew mi)"
Ban ci yile jëf ci li àju ci Tombouctou mooy dëgg?,"The correct answer is **B: Moo gëna exotik kë luñu neewal doole**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Tey, Timbuktu ab gox bu neew doole la, donte niñ ko xàmee mooy tax mu doon luy xëcc turist yi"" (Today, Timbuktu is a poor region, even though its fame is what attracts tourists). This implies that its reputation for being exotic and remote (even though it's now underdeveloped) still draws people in. This is the ""exotic despite being impoverished"" concept.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mën nañu dem ci dëkk bi ak roplaan (You can get to the city by airplane):** The passage doesn't specifically mention air travel to Timbuktu.
*   **C: Amul flair bu bari suñ ko mengalee ay dëkk yi ko wër (It doesn't have much flair compared to the cities around it):** The passage says the opposite: ""Dëkk bii wuutena lool ay yeneen dëkk yi ci réew, ndax dëkku arab la gëna nuru dëkku Afrique."" (This city is very different from other cities in the country, because it looks more like an Arab city than an African one.)
*   **D: Dëkk mënatul xëcc ay touriste (The city can't attract tourists anymore):** The passage explicitly says the opposite: its fame *still* attracts tourists, despite its poverty."
Kañ lañu njëkka waajal Jeux Olympiques yu été bi? ,"The correct answer is **D: Sulet 2020**

This clearly indicates preparations and arrangements were being made in **2020** before the postponement. The other options are either dates of the actual events or later responses to the delay.

**Therefore, the answer is D: Sulet 2020**"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ci ban jamono la ab seggukaay di doon ab tornade?","The correct answer is **D: So laalee suuf si ba noppi**

Here's why:

The passage says ""Dañuy door ne saxaar buy jóge cii ndiir yi te bu ñu laalee suuf rekk nekk ay taw yu àndak ngelaw,"" which translates to ""They start as funnels coming from the clouds and only become tornadoes when they touch the ground.""
"
Ban ci yile mooy ab melokaanu tornage bu jub?,"The correct answer is **A: Dañuy sos ay ngelawi 100 ba 200 miles ci waxtu wu nekk**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Dañuy defa ngelaw yu ab doole(yen saay 100-200 miles/waxtu wu nekk)"". This translates to ""They create strong winds (sometimes 100-200 miles/hour)"".
*   The passage states that they carry heavy items.
*   The passage does not describe funnels before reaching the ground or columns pushing air outward."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ci fan la ab tukkikat wara amee tektal ci li aju ci anamu polotik ci gox buñu jëm?","The passage focuses on official government advisories and the potential for different perceptions based on nationality and political climate.  Therefore, the most accurate answer is **A: Bawoo ci nguuru réew mi di nañ la seetsi** (From the government of the country they are going to, they will seek it).

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Bawoo ci gisiin yu nekk ci xalaatu tukkikat yi** (From the opinions that are in the traveler's thoughts): While a traveler's own opinions matter, the passage emphasizes external advisories and perceptions.
*   **C: Bawoo ci ñi dëkk ci réew mi ñuy dem** (From those who live in the country they are going to): While local perspectives are valuable, the passage highlights official guidance and broader biases, not solely the opinions of local residents.
*   **D: Ci seen nguuru bopp** (From their own government): While a traveler's home country's government provides travel advisories, the passage focuses on the political climate *in the destination country*, hence the importance of information related to that country."
"Su amee ab tektalu tukki, lan la ab doomu réew warul dundu?","Based on the passage, the most likely thing a citizen traveling to a politically sensitive country might *not* want to experience is:

*   **C: Asiransu wergu-yaram buñu laal (Health insurance that is affected/impacted)**

The passage directly mentions the potential difficulty in getting travel health insurance or having travel plans insured when traveling to a country deemed unsafe. This implies a potential disruption or adverse impact on health insurance coverage.

The other options are less directly implied as negative experiences:

*   A: Asiransu fomm buñu konselé (Canceled trip insurance) - While related, the passage implies difficulty getting/having affected insurance rather than outright cancellation.
*   B: Tëŋk buñu yombal anamu polotiku réew mi (Oversimplification of the country's political situation) - While oversimplification can be problematic, it's not presented as a direct, personal negative consequence for the traveler.
*   D: Ay xibaar yu leer yu àju ci anamu polotiku réew mi (Clear information about the country's political situation) - Clear information would be *beneficial* to the traveler, not something they would want to avoid.

Therefore, C is the most direct and logical answer."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban xeetu tukki moo warul laaj ndimbalu jàpp ci ab tukkikat?","Let's analyze the passage and the answer choices to determine which type of travel likely *doesn't* require the assistance of a travel agent.

The passage states that travel agencies exist to help with various aspects of travel, including unfamiliar destinations, cultures, languages, and more complex bookings.

Now let's examine the options:

*   **A: Ab tukki jëm ci ab ndajem liggéey ci ab gox bi nga xamne tukkikat bi demoon na fa (A trip for a business meeting in a location that the traveler has already been to):** If the traveler has already been to the location, they are likely familiar with the area, transportation, and logistics. They might not need assistance.
*   **B: Ab tukkib ñaari ayu-bis ci ab budget bu xejjiku lool (A two-day trip on a very tight budget):** A tight budget often requires careful planning and searching for the best deals, which a travel agent can help with, although not always necessary.
*   **C: Ab tukki buy feeñ ci ab bariyeeru lakk (A trip that involves a language barrier):** The passage explicitly states that travel agencies can assist with language barriers.
*   **D: Tukkib ab tukkikat bu njëkk ci bitim-réew (A first-time trip abroad):** A first-time trip abroad can be daunting, with unfamiliar customs, procedures, and potential difficulties. A travel agent could be very helpful.

**Therefore, the best answer is A: Ab tukki jëm ci ab ndajem liggéey ci ab gox bi nga xamne tukkikat bi demoon na fa.**

**Final Answer: A**"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ci ban anam la ab tukkikat wara gëna mëna jëfandikoo ndimbalu ab tukkikat?","The correct answer is **D: Su tukkikat bi nekkee di dem ci ab barab bi nga xamantane dañoo miin wuute yi am si cosaan** (If the traveler is going to a place where they are accustomed to cultural differences).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes:**  Travel agencies, especially specialized ones, can help navigate cultures, languages, and different countries. This is crucial when dealing with cultural differences. The passage highlights the advantage of finding an agency that aligns with your needs.
* **Why the other options are less likely:**
    * **A:** (Round trip to native land) While agencies can help with this, it's a straightforward task not necessarily requiring the specialized knowledge mentioned in the passage.
    * **B:** (Booking a seat on an upcoming flight) This is a routine booking that almost any agency or even an online travel portal can handle.
    * **C:** (Understanding the language of the country they are going to) While helpful, not understanding the language does not *necessitate* the need of a specialized travel agent. It may be overcome by learning a few basic phrases or using translators.

Therefore, option D best reflects the value of a travel agent's expertise as described in the provided text."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan mo wara tax ab tukkikat mëna moytu suy dem ci ay barab yu bees?","The correct answer is **A: Xaar ay baxoo yu ni mel niki fuñu bawoo** (Expect behaviors similar to where they come from).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes differences:** The passage explicitly states that things like ""Doxalin, sart, lekk, dem ak dikk bi, dëkkuwaay, tektalukaay, kàllaama ak yeneen dinañu wuute tuuti ak fi nga dëkk"" (walking, laws, food, travel, housing, etiquette, language, etc. will be slightly different from where you live).  Therefore, *expecting* the same behaviors (baxoo) would be the opposite of what the passage advises.  By *not* expecting things to be the same, the traveler can avoid problems.

The other options are not directly addressed in the text:

* **B: Bëgg-bëggu ñam ay lekk yuñu tamul** (Desire to eat unfamiliar foods): The text mentions food differences but doesn't say to avoid *wanting* to try them.
* **C: Dugg ci yenn yoon yu mel ni fi ñu bawoo** (Enter certain streets similar to where they come from):  The text doesn't mention streets specifically.
* **D: Moytu ay gëstug njëlbëen ci dalaukaay bi** (Avoid initial investigations at the welcome center): The text doesn't mention welcome centers or investigations.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban xeetu nit moo wara dundu mbeteel suy tukki ci barab bumu xamul?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: Kenn ku bëgg xalaatam tëju** (Someone with a closed mind).

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes being aware of differences when traveling. Someone with a closed mind would be unwilling to accept or adapt to those differences, making them more likely to experience difficulties or misunderstandings (i.e., ""mbeteel"" or ""mbañeelu anam yuñ koy defee"").
*   The other options aren't directly related to the passage's core message:

    *   ""Kenn ku bëgg ay ñam yu bawoo fu sori"" (Someone who likes food from faraway places) suggests an openness to new experiences, which is the opposite of being closed-minded.
    *   ""Kenn ku bëgg coppite"" (Someone who loves change) indicates adaptability, again contrasting with a closed mind.
    *   ""Kenn ku bëgg jang"" (Someone who likes to learn) implies curiosity and a willingness to understand new things, which is also against a closed mind."
Ban ci yile tektal lañu digëlul tukkikat yi ngir ñu dem ci réew mu am koom ci yoon bu njëkk?,"Based on the text, here's the breakdown:

*   **P states:**
    *   Avoid underestimating local customs.
    *   New travelers should prioritize spending on accommodations, food, and necessities to adjust.
    *   Avoid sleeping on mattresses or cushions on the ground in unfamiliar cities.
    *   Bring camping gear (tent and mosquito net) to avoid insects.

Comparing this to the answer choices:

*   **A: Xam allu mala bi ci dëkk bi laata ngay tëdd ci suuf (Know the area of the city before sleeping on the ground)** - This is implied by the statement about avoiding sleeping on mattresses/cushions on the ground in unfamiliar cities.
*   **B: Moytu def ay yëfi dof ci lekk bi ci say bis yu jëkk (Avoid foolish things in food during your first days)** - The text advises spending on food but doesn't specifically caution against ""foolish things."" It focuses on adjusting to the climate.
*   **C: Ab lalu liir lañuy digle sooy def camping ci biti (A mosquito net is advisable when camping outside)** - This directly matches the advice to bring a mosquito net for camping.
*   **D: Dugal sa loxo ci ab otel bu baax sooy njëkka aksi (Invest in a good hotel when you first arrive)** - This matches the advice to spend on good accommodations when first arriving.

Therefore, the answer is **B: Moytu def ay yëfi dof ci lekk bi ci say bis yu jëkk (Avoid foolish things in food during your first days)** because the passage does not explicitly say to avoid doing foolish things while eating."
Ban ci yile lañu lim niki mbir mi nga xamantane def ay yëfi dof suñuy jéema miin climat wu ab réew bu am koom?,"The correct answer is **C: Ab matla wala ab cousing ngir dem camping**.

The passage advises *against* sleeping on mattresses or cushions on the ground if you don't know much about the area, especially when camping. This implies it's something you should avoid, not something recommended, when adapting to the climate. The other options (eating well, good service, good hotels) are implicitly suggested as helpful or neutral, not harmful, for adapting to a new climate.
"
"Yan ci yile tànnéef ñooy doon li gën ci ñi yore sàrt te bëgg ab sotti bu virtuel bu seen polotik, te baña mëna jot ci internet?","Based on the original text (P) and the question (Q), the best option for someone who wants a virtual copy of their policy but cannot access the internet is:

*   **C: Teye ab sotti buñu deñc ci seen memuwaaru prdinatëër portaabal** (Keep a copy stored on their portable computer's memory).

**Reasoning:**

*   The text specifically advises: ""Su fekkee dangay tukki ak ordinatër wala tablet, dncal ab kopi c dnckaayam wal disk( nga mën c jot te nekkoo ci lënd gi)"" which translates to: ""If you are traveling with a computer or tablet, save a copy to its memory or disk (so you can access it without being on the network).""
*   This directly addresses the scenario of not having internet access.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   A (Give a copy to the travel agency) is not relevant to digital copies of the document.
*   B (Send emails to each other) requires internet access.
*   D (Store a copy in ""the cloud"") requires internet access."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile lañu warul wone ci sàrt bi?","The correct answer is **D: Aderess imelu kiy jël asirans bi.**

Here's why:

* **P** (the original advice) focuses on protecting your personal information and ensuring you have access to important documents. It advises against giving away your insurance policy and personal details.

* **A, B, and C** are all related to the insurance company (asirekat bi) or international phone numbers used for authorizations. Providing these might be necessary in certain situations.

* **D** is asking for the *insured person's* email address (kiiy jël asirans bi). Sharing *that* is not mentioned as something you should be withholding according to the provided paragraph.

Therefore, the only option that isn't explicitly supported by the text as something you should avoid sharing is **D**.
"
"Sunu sukandikoo ci xët bi, ban dayoo bu bo moo mengook tëggiinu filmu buñuy jëfandikoo lu gëna bari?","The passage states that the most commonly used film format is 35 mm, specifically a 36 x 24 mm negative. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: 36 x 24 mm negatif**
"
Yan ci yile tëgginu filmu ñooy joxe ab tëraliin bu nirook ab DSLR?,"The answer is **A: Filmu 35 mm**.

The passage states that the 35mm film can be easily sourced if needed and offers a ""solution that is somewhat similar to an SDLR that can be compared with it."" This indicates that it's the closest film format to a DSLR in the context of the passage.

"
"Sooy tambali ab këru bind tukku, yan man-man nga wara njëkka ñoŋal?","The correct answer is **A: Def blogging (Def blogging)**

The passage states that the easiest way to start a travel writing career is to practice your skills on a travel blog. This implies that ""Def blogging"" is the first skill to hone. The other options come later.
"
Ci ban xeetu climat lañuy gis ay jafe-jafe ci wàllu buit?,"The passage states that stomach problems are common in hot climates (""jafe-jafe biir ci kilimaa yu tàng yi tamit barina""). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: Kilimaa yu tang**
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ab exposition buy sax mën na waral immunité wu lan?","The correct answer is **B: Ay germe yu ci dëkk bi** (Germs that live there/Local germs).

The text states that people who live in areas with many germs can develop immunity.
"
Ban ci yile mooy ab awantaasu tukki ci barabu Schengen ?,"The correct answer is **C: Moytu ay saytug passpoor yu bari** (Avoid many passport checks).

The passage explicitly states: ""Fileek yaa ngi nekk ci barab bii, mën nga jéggi fronceer bi te du jar kenn di xoolaat sa paaspoor"" which translates to ""If you are in this area, you can cross the border without anyone checking your passport again.""

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Moytu bindu ci ay wisa yu bari (Avoid applying for many visas):** This is true, as the passage states you only need one Schengen visa to travel within the zone. However, C is a more direct advantage to travelling inside of Schengen.

*   **B: Sakkanal xaalis (Save money):** While it *can* save money by avoiding visa fees, the passage doesn't explicitly mention saving money as the *primary* advantage.

*   **D: Soxawul benn passpoor (Does not need a passport):** The passage states that you can move around without it being checked, but does not say that you don't need one.

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci jëmuwaayu Vancouver mooy doon bul xëcc lu bari ngir tukkikat yuy xalaat njëg yi? ","The correct answer is **C: Duunu Bowen**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Whistler is expensive. Granville Island is mentioned only as the departure point for ferries to Bowen Island. The Sea to Sky Corridor is mentioned in connection to Whistler, so it is likely more expensive. Bowen Island, however, is described as a place where you can kayak, hike, shop, and dine, without any mention of it being particularly expensive. Therefore, it's the most likely cost-effective option for budget-conscious travelers.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban jëmuwaay moo gëna wara mëna mey tukkikat yi ab jaar-jaanru Vancouver bu neex?","The correct answer is **A: Bowen Island**.

Here's why:

*   The text describes Bowen Island as a place where you can kayak, hike, shop, and eat. It's also accessible from Vancouver via a water taxi. This makes it a great option for a varied and enjoyable Vancouver experience.
*   Whistler is also mentioned, but it's described as expensive and is primarily associated with winter activities.
*   Granville Island is mentioned as the location of the water taxi to Bowen Island, and Downtown Vancouver is mentioned as being near Howe Sound, where the island is. These two are not ideal for tourist experiences."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kañ la tukkikat yi wara dem ci Chutes yi suñuy wut ay vues yu sori?","The correct answer is **D: Suñu génnée ci saison taw yi**

Here's why:

*   The passage says ""Ci jamonoy nawet (nowàmbre ba màrs), ndox mi dafay gêna yokk suko defee wall gi di gëna mëna lore...ndax tolluwaay ndox bi dafa bari ba sa gissinu ndox yiy wàdd day nëmbu- ndox mbepp sooke ko!""
*   This translates to: ""During the rainy season (November to March), the water increases and the mist is more significant...the water level is so high that your view of the falls will be obscured by the mist!""
*   Therefore, to get *good* views *without* being obscured by mist, you would want to visit *outside* of the rainy season. So, that means, you want to visit *after* the rainy season ends."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan mooy awantaasu dem ci Chutes yu Victoria digante Nowambar ak Màrs?","The correct answer is **A: Vues yuñu mënul jël ci Chutes yi**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Ci beneen fànna, dama leer ndax tolluwaay ndox bi dafa bari ba sa gissinu ndox yiy wàdd day nëmbu- ndox mbepp sooke ko!"" which translates to ""On the other hand, I am clear that the amount of water is so much that your view of the falling water is obscured - everything is soaked!"" This means that during the months of November to March (Nowàmbre ba Màrs), the amount of water is so high that it obscures the view of the falls. Therefore, the main disadvantage is that you won't be able to properly see the falls.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile lañu diglewul suñuy jefandikoo ab drône ngir filmé?","The correct answer is **D: Filme ci ay barab yu bari nit kese fuñu dul mëna raññee drône yi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Di nawal bénn drone ci wétu aydapor wala ci kaw ay nit xalaat bu bon la daanaka, donté téréwugnuko ci sad eek."" (Flying a drone near an airport or over people is almost a bad idea, even if you are not forbidden to do so legally).

Let's look at why the other options are not the *best* answer, though they are implied to a degree:

*   **A: Xool ci njëlbéen luñu nangu nga filmé (Looking first at what you are allowed to film)** This is correct in principle, because the passage says to check the regulations for filming. But D is a more specific rule to follow.
*   **B: Jot yeneeni licence (Obtain additional licenses)** This is indirectly implied by the passage saying to check what documents you need to provide. But the implication is weaker than the statement against filming over crowds.
*   **C: Wut ay permis (Look for permits)** This is also implied by ""yan kayit nga wara joxe"" (which documents you need to provide) but again, D is more specific.

Therefore, option D is the most direct and accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, yan barab ñoo gën barab ngir filmé sooy jëfandikoo ab drône?","The best answer is **D: Ci barab yi nga amee permi** (In places where you have permission).

Here's why:

*   **P emphasizes legality:** The passage explicitly states you need to check what you're allowed to film and what permits you need (""jëkkal saytu li ñula may nga widewo ko ak yan kayit nga wara joxe"").

Let's analyze the other options:

*   **A: Ci wetu mbooloo yu teewaayu drône yi dul dérangé (Near crowds where the drone won't be disturbing):** While avoiding disturbance is good practice, the passage prioritizes legal permission. The passage mentions ""Di nawal bénn drone ci wétu aydapor wala ci kaw ay nit xalaat bu bon la daanaka"".
*   **B: Ci barab yi nga xamantane dañuy nangu ñu jël fa ay foto yu bari (In places where they allow you to take many photos):** The passage warns against filming even photos, so permission to take photos does not necessarily extend to videos with a drone.
*   **C: Ci barab yu fees yi nga xamantane drône duñu yomba gis (In crowded places where drones are not easy to see):** The passage warns against flying a drone close to crowds.

**Therefore, answer D aligns directly with the passage's emphasis on obtaining the necessary permission and complying with regulations.**"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban wax bu àju ci bindug càkkutéef ngir defar visa mooy dëgg?","The correct answer is **D: Ci yenn barab yi, otel yi ci dëkk bi di nañu mëna toppatoo bindu gi** (In some places, hotels in the city may handle the registration).

The passage explicitly states: ""Ci réew yu bari yu am yoon buni mel, otel yu nekk ci barab bi dina ñu toppatoo bindu gi (fexel ba laaj)"" - ""In many countries that have a similar law, hotels in the area will handle the registration (depending on the situation)."" This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: So dalee ci ay barabi dëkkuwaayi touriste, mën nga baña soxla bindu** (If you stay in tourist residences, you may not need to register). While implied as a possibility, the text doesn't explicitly say you *may not* need to register.
*   **B: Réew yépp dañuy laaj bindu ci nguur yi ci dëkk bi** (All countries require registration with local authorities). The passage states this is *required* in some countries, making it incorrect to say it is required in *all* countries.
*   **C: Mën nañu la laaj nga dem ci biro imigrasioŋ yi** (You may be asked to go to the immigration office). While also true, Option D is a better answer because it is explained as being a regular practice in many countries.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate and well-supported answer based on the provided text."
Ban ci yile moo nekkul ab barab bu ab touriste wara dem ngir toppatoo bindu wam?,"The passage states that tourists might need to register at immigration offices, hotels, or by filling out a form. It doesn't mention police stations or post offices as places for registration. Therefore, the answer is C: Ab biro post bu nekk ci dëkk bii.
"
Kan moodul jariñoo ci vonlontariat suy tukki?,"The correct answer is **B: Kenn kuy wut ab payoor bu am solo** (Someone looking for a significant salary).

Here's why:

* **The passage critiques exploitative volunteer tourism:** The passage acknowledges the benefits of helping others while traveling, but warns against volunteer work that merely provides accommodation and food in exchange for labor, paying very little. This is described as exploiting people for cheap labor, disguised as volunteerism.

* **The question asks who *wouldn't* benefit from this type of volunteer tourism:** Someone looking for a significant salary would be precisely the person who *wouldn't* benefit from this kind of volunteer tourism because it offers very little pay (or none at all).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kenn ku yaakaar mêna am ay xarit bitim-réew** (Someone hoping to make friends abroad): The passage implies that even exploitative volunteer work *could* lead to making friends, so this person *could* still benefit on some level.
* **C: Kenn ku yaakaara am xarañtéef bu bees** (Someone hoping to gain new skills): Although the passage emphasizes the issues with low pay, the passage does mention, ""sax am ay man-man yu bees""(develop new skills) so that is a plus.
* **D: Kenn ku néeg ak bitim-réew soxal** (Someone who needs accommodation and food abroad): The passage says it gives rooms and meals to people, so that would be a plus

Therefore, option B is the only one that clearly indicates someone who *wouldn't* benefit from the type of volunteer tourism described in the passage because they are seeking financial compensation.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, nan la volontariat so nekkee bitim-réew amee njariñ ci tukkikat yu seen budget bariwul?","The correct answer is **C: Yenn saay dañuy joxe néeg ak sangokaay** (Sometimes they provide lodging and food).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""...ndax liggéey yu bari yuñuy def te sentu wuñu dara dañuy jox néeg ak lékk ñenn ñi te fay payoor bu ndàw"" which translates to ""...because many volunteer works give lodging and food to some and pay a small salary."" This directly supports answer choice C.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Dañuy joxe ab saleer mën ñu wax saa su nekk** (They always give a salary). While the passage mentions a small salary is sometimes offered, it's not guaranteed.
*   **B: Dafay tax li ci ëpp nga am ay wërsëgi liggéey** (Mostly it helps you to obtain work benefits).  While experience gained from volunteering *could* potentially help with future employment, this is not the primary benefit emphasized in the passage in relation to budget travelers.
*   **D: Mën na la jàppale nga am mëna am beneen gis-gis** (It can help you to gain another vision). While volunteering can help you have a different outlook, it's not explicitly related to budget travelers in the passage.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan lañuy jappee lu atypique ci tukki bu yemaay ci Walt Disney World?","The passage describes a typical Walt Disney World trip as one where you arrive at the Orlando airport, go to a Disney resort, stay there the whole time, and then return home.

The question asks what is considered *atypical*. Of the choices:

*   **A: Def ab ayu-bis di xuus ci biir park yi**: This aligns with the typical trip as described.

*   **B: Nekk ci ab otel bu nekkul ci site bi**: The passage implies that staying on-site is typical. So, staying off-site would be atypical.

*   **C: Nekk ci moomeelu Disney ci tukki bi yépp**: This is what's described as typical.

*   **D: Jël ab kaar bawoo ci aydapoor bi dem ci otel bi**: The passage implies this is what would happen if you are staying on site.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Nekk ci ab otel bu nekkul ci site bi**
"
Ban ci yile kàddu yu àju ci Walt Disney World moo nekkul dëgg?,"The correct answer is **A: Tiketi Park-hopper yi mën nañ leen jox yeneen tukkikat**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Tike yi kenn menu leena jox keneen,"" which means ""Tickets cannot be given to someone else."" Therefore, option A is false according to the passage.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile mbir lañu dul toppatoo ci ab kalaasu taggatu ngir am liggéey wala ci ay siiwal?","According to the text:

*   **P mentions:**
    *   Training to prepare for dangerous environments (hostile environment course).
    *   Learning to avoid problems in a region.
    *   Detailed explanations of issues, common scenarios, and practical exercises.
    *   Role-playing.
    *   Learning how to help people and use weapons.
    *   A lack of publications about surviving in war zones.

Based on this, we can see that:

*   **C: Waajal barabu geer bi (Preparing for a war zone)** is specifically mentioned as something that *isn't* widely covered in publications.
*   **B: Waajal secours yu njëkk yi (First Aid Preparation)** it could be implied as part of helping others in need.
*   **D: Jouer benn rôle (Playing a role)** is explicitly mentioned as part of the training.

Therefore, the answer is **A: Dundu ci barabu sauvage (Surviving in the wilderness)**. While wilderness survival skills might be *useful*, the text explicitly contrasts resources for wilderness survival with the *lack* of resources for war zone survival. The passage explicitly states that there are many books on wilderness survival, implying this is a topic already addressed.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile tomb lañu gëna mëna def ci ab kalaasu tàggatu ngir am liggéey?","The correct answer is **D: Barab yu hostile yi** (Hostile environments).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions a ""Hostile environment course"" as being relevant for someone deploying to a conflict zone (which is implied by ""area of war"" and ""area of conflict"").
*   The passage discusses the importance of learning how to avoid targeting work offices in the area, handle problems, and deal with real-world situations.
*   The whole purpose of the training, as described in the passage, is to prepare someone for the dangers and challenges of working in a hostile environment.

The other options are less relevant:

*   **A: Secours yu njëkk (First aid):** While important in general, the passage doesn't emphasize it as the *primary* focus of the training. It's more of a general survival skill that may be part of the course, but it's not the core competency.
*   **B: Barabu geer bi (Area of war):** This is a *type* of hostile environment, but the course is designed to prepare for *any* hostile environment, not just war zones.
*   **C: Dundaat ci barab bu sowaas (Surviving in a desert):** This is a specific survival skill set, not directly related to the complexities of navigating a hostile environment with social and political considerations."
"Sunu sukkandiko ci xët bi, lan mooy tànnéef bi gën ngir moytu ndox mu ñu jàpp ni dafa am doomu jangoro?","The correct answer is **B: Jënd ndox yuñuy def ci biteel** (Buy bottled water).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly recommends buying bottled water from reputable companies as a safe option.
* The passage highlights concerns about tap water safety."
"Suniu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan moo wara nekk lu xawa mëna nekk ba ci feeykat yu gëna xarañ?","The passage says currents are what cause the issue. It mentions deep water currents specifically. Therefore, the answer is:

**B: Feey ci ndo mu xóot** (Swimming in deep water)
"
Lan nga wara def su la courant jàppee?,"The passage P says: ""So gennee ci kurang bi, feeey dellu dootul metti ne ni muy faral di mel. Jeema dem ci bërëb bi nga xamanteni duun lafa jaapat..."" This means escaping the current makes swimming back to shore easier. It also suggests swimming to a place where the current doesn't grip you.

Based on this, the best answer is:

*   **C: Feey ci beneen jubluwaay bi** (Swim in another direction).

The passage doesn't say to swim to shore immediately, but rather to get out of the current first. Option A is similar but it says ""tefes bu baax bi"".
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ci ban barab la wisitu ab chateau mênee doon ab génnug wakans bu am solo?","The correct answer is **C: Ci Vallée du Rhin**.

The passage explicitly mentions ""siyaare ay château ci vallé bu Loire, vallée bu Rhin"" (visiting castles in the Loire Valley, Rhine Valley) as examples of good vacation themes. Therefore, the Rhine Valley is a place where visiting a castle could be a great vacation theme.
"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile lañu dul digël jigéen yuy tukki ci barab bi?","The correct answer is **A: Baña waxtaane ay etat civil (Not to discuss their marital status)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically **requires** women to claim they are married when traveling, regardless of their actual marital status. This directly contradicts the idea of not discussing their marital status.
*   The passage advises women to be aware of cultural differences that may lead to behaviors that are interpreted as harassment and to respond assertively (""dëggër leen ci dogal yi ngeen di jël, te bu leen ragal di dëggal seen bopp""). It also recommends wearing jewelry but not excessively expensive jewelry.
*   Therefore, options B, C, and D are all recommended. Only A is something the passage explicitly tells women *to not do* (implicitly, by stating they *must* declare a marital status, even if false)."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci barab buñu leeral ci xët bi, lan mooy doon ab tektal bu baax ngir jigéen yuy tukki?","The best answer based on the text is **B: Sol ab jaaro bu yaatu ngir wone ni da ngay sey** (Wear a modest headscarf to indicate that you are married).

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly mentions that women traveling should declare they are married, regardless of their actual marital status, and that wearing a *jaaro* (headscarf) is a good thing. Though it says not to wear an expensive *jaaro*, the fact it mentions it at all makes this the best answer.

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Nangu ni lu neew la nga am ñu lay bayyi xel** (Accept that you have little authority and people will ignore you): This contradicts the latter part of the text, which encourages women to be confident and assertive in their decisions.
*   **C: Nànd ni wuute si wàllu cosaan dafay digle nga wey di nekk ci sa taxawaay** (Accept that cultural differences require you to stay in your place): This is in direct opposition to the last part, which says differences shouldn't get in the way of asserting yourself.
*   **D: Sudee dañu lay jéema wax lu la neexul, fasal sa kanal di bañal góor ñi** (If someone tries to say something you don't like, cut off the conversation and insult men): This is not explicitly mentioned in the text and would be an over-exaggeration.

Therefore, B is the most reasonable answer based directly on the text provided."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban anam moo mêna tax ba ab fotogaraafu mala jëfandikoo ab yëf bu spesiyaal?","D: Sudee park bi dafa am ay sàrtu yu xejjiku yu àju ci foto mala yi

The passage mentions that ""park yi duñu la may nga nataal lo xam ni mën nga ci am dara"" which implies that parks have specific rules regarding photographing wildlife.  Therefore, option D is the most relevant answer.
"
Ban ci yile lañu limul ci xët bii niki ab jafe-jafe bu mëna am ci foto ay mala?,"The correct answer is **A: Gis yenn mala yuy joge fu sori**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that it is difficult to photograph certain wildlife that is difficult to find and wildlife in parks might not allow you to take the picture you desire. This relates to the difficulty of finding and getting close enough to animals.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Bayyi xel ci mala yuy songaate**: While animal attacks might be a general concern when dealing with wildlife, it's not explicitly mentioned as a *specific challenge* of wildlife photography in the passage.
*   **C: Seet xeetu letille lentilles yimuy laaj**: The passage discusses the need for long lenses (khëccukaayu foto bu guddu) and different lenses for specific situations (like birds in flight or small insects).
*   **D: Liggéey ci ay barab yu hotiles**: The passage only mentions that the environment might be cold, hot, or difficult (Bërëb bi niruna lu sédd, tang, wala métti)."
Ban ci yile mooy wara mëna waral ay jafe-jafe ci ab dawalkat buy tukko ci ay montaañ?,"The passage describes several difficulties a driver might face when driving in mountainous, snowy, or icy conditions. These include:

Out of the provided answer choices, only **""Gisiin bu waññeeku"" (Reduced visibility)** is explicitly mentioned as a potential problem.
Therefore, the correct answer is **D**."
Lan mo wara doon luy wey di sax ci juuti yuñuy jëlee ci njuréef yu ci réew yu bari yu?,"The correct answer is **A: Njëg yi (The Prices)**.

Here's why:

*   **The Passage's Focus:** The passage discusses the complexities of taxes (juuti) for diplomats working abroad. It highlights how tax rules and amounts vary between countries.
*   **What Stays Consistent?** In the context of varying taxes and locations, the *prices* of goods and services in the host country are the only factor that consistently influences the ""njuréef yu ci réew yu bari"" (the benefits/advantages of living in different countries). The cost of living (driven by prices) is a major factor determining whether the diplomat's income, after taxes, allows for a certain standard of living.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Barabu liggéeyukaay (Location of the workplace):** The location of the workplace is relevant to the diplomat's experience, but doesn't directly tie into the tax structure as closely as prices do.
*   **C: Fi ngay déposé (Where you deposit):** Where the diplomat deposits their money (bank, etc.) is generally independent of the varying tax regulations and cost of living.
*   **D: Jàppukaay yi (The Holders):** This is vague and doesn't have a clear connection to the varying tax situations and effects."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, sooy liggéey bitim-réew te nga nekk feneen, fan ngay wara déposé say juuti ci say njuréef?","The correct answer is **C: Ci réew mi nga xamantane foo ngay liggéeyee**.

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""Ludul nga nekk ab dipolomat, liggéeyee bitim réew mu ngi tekki ni da nga wara dekalaare say juuti ci alal bi ngay am ci réew bi nga nekk."" This translates to: ""Being a diplomat working abroad means you have to declare your taxes on the assets you have in the country where you are located."" This directly states you need to declare your taxes in the country where you are working.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fépp fooy nekk lu bari** (Everywhere you live frequently) - While you may have tax obligations in multiple locations, the passage focuses on the country where you are *working* as a diplomat.
* **B: Ci Etats-unis** (In the United States) - The passage mentions the US as an example where tax rules vary, but it doesn't mean that's where you *always* pay taxes.
* **D: Fépp fi nga xamantane njëg yi foofu la gëna yombee** (Everywhere where prices are cheaper) - This is irrelevant to tax obligations."
Ban ci yile wax moodul leeral bu baax ab Fuwaar universel?,"The correct answer is **B: Dañuy wone expositions botaniques ci wetu ay exposants fentkat ak yuy jangale**.

Here's why:

* **The passage clearly states that ""Foire ortikol internasional yi, ay xew-xew yu mag lañu, yuy wane lépp luy flër, jardin botanik ak leneen lépp luñu mëna tuddee gàñcax."" This means that horticultural (gardening/botanical) exhibitions are separate events from Universal Expositions.** Universal Expositions (Fuwaar Internasiyonaal) focus on culture, tradition, innovation, and technological advancement from different countries.

Let's look at why the other options are NOT the best answer:

*   **A: Expositions yi dañoo wara wone jaar-jaar wala cosaanu ab réew** - This aligns with the passage which mentions réew yi bokk wone nañu ay nataalu aada ak cosaan
*   **C: Xew-xew yi mën nañu def juróom benni weer** - This also aligns with the passage which mentions diiru ñatt ba juróom benni weer lañuy faral di am ci yoon.
*   **D: Dañuy laaj réew yi ñu bokk** - This is also in agreement with the text, in that countries need to join or be asked to be a part of the event.

Therefore, **B** is the statement that is **NOT** a good description of a Universal Exposition, because it mixes it with another, separate type of exhibition.
"
Yan ci yile mooy ab sàrtu Fuwaar Universel wala Exposition internationale?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is:

**A: Expositions yi dañu wara wone jaar-jaaru ab réew mi ak jafe-jafe yimu am ci adduna bi**

**Explanation:**

The passage states: ""Réew yi bokk wone nañu ay nataalu aada ak cosaan ak yuy yete ci bërëb biir réew bi ngir fésal yoonu àdduna wala seen aada ak tariixu réew."" This indicates that participating countries showcase their culture, heritage, and progress, implicitly addressing their role and challenges in the world.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Benn réew mi mênul dalal xew-xew yi ci at mi yépp**: The provided passage does not provide information about how many times a country is allowed to host these events.
*   **C: Xew-xew yi dañoo wara def lu toll ci juróom benni weer**: The passage states that these events typically last ""ñatt ba juróom benni weer"" (three to six months), not necessarily exactly six months.
*   **D: Ngir fuwaar bi mêna am, réew yépp a wara bokk**: The passage doesn't explicitly state that all countries *must* participate for the event to take place. It implies that many countries participate, but not necessarily all.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate reflection of the information given in the text."
Ban ci yile jëf mooy waññi risk bi nga xamantane mala yi mën nañ la song?,"Li ci gën mooy **B: Gennee mbaliit yu ci camping bi**.

* **Gennnee mbaliit yu ci camping bi** day waññi lëkk yu nekk ci biir mbaliit yooyu. Lëkk yoyu moo di xëcc mala yi, te boo ko waññi, mala yi duñu leen xëcc laal camping bi te duñu fi ñëw ngir songu nit ñi.

* **A: Yore ay ñax yu am saf-safal** manees na ko jëfandikoo ngir moytu mala yi, waaye du loolu moo di waññi risk bi gën a rëy.
* **C: Bayyi ab digante bu toll ci 25 yaar ak xaju àll yi** wax nañu ko ci biir xibaar bi ngir moytu waaye du waññi risk bi gën a rëy.
* **D: Fexe ba mala yi dem ci ay desit lekk** du loolu moo di yoon ndax waruñu jox mala yi lëkk.

Kon nak, gennnee mbaliit yi moo di li ci gën ngir waññi risk bi.
"
Ban ci yile lañu limul ci xët bi niki lu mëna wara ay congi mala?,"The correct answer is **B: Ñakka teye bayyi ab digante (Not keeping a distance)**.

The passage explicitly states that many visitors get injured each year because they don't maintain the recommended distance from the animals. This directly translates to not keeping a distance. The passage doesn't mention food types, training of animals, or animals used to human contact as a reason for the injuries.
