He aha te pakanga e whakaahuatia ana i ētahi wā ko te ‘pakanga whakapono’ whakamutunga?,"The passage states: ""Me te aha, ko tēnei pakanga torutekau tau te pakanga whakamutunga e tohua ai he pakanga hāhī.""

This translates to: ""Furthermore, the Thirty Years' War was the last war to be labeled as a religious war.""

Therefore, the correct answer is A: E toru tekau tau te Pakanga (Thirty Years' War).

Ko tehea o ngā āhuatanga e whai ake nei o te Hāhi Katorika kāore i tirotirohia?,"The passage discusses the following criticisms of the Catholic Church:

*   Its wealth and whether it was using it appropriately to alleviate poverty.
*   The concentration of power and wealth in Rome.
*   Whether its actions aligned with its core beliefs.

The passage doesn't specifically mention a debate about whether the Church's fundamental principles should be changed. Therefore, the best answer is:

**B: Mēnā me whakarerekē ngā kaupapa matua o te hāhi** (Whether the fundamental principles of the church should be changed)

The other options are touched on by the passage:

*   **A:** is directly discussed as the passage questions if the wealth is being used as the church's teachings instruct.
*   **C:** is implied because the power structure is being questioned.
*   **D:** is a central focus as the passage assesses whether the Church's actions align with its beliefs."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i patua i Versailles?","The correct answer is **D: He kaitiaki**.

The passage states that ""tētahi mema o te māpu i pōwhiriwhiritia e tētahi mema o te māpu i te upoko o tētahi tautiaki o te whare ariki i whakamatehia ki Versailles."" This translates to ""a member of the mob waved the head of a royal guard who was killed at Versailles."" So, the person killed at Versailles was a guard.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei kihai i whakatikatikahia ki te Kingi me te Kuini e te mano?,"The correct answer is **B: He putanga ohorere mai i Versailles (A sudden departure from Versailles)**

Here's why:

*   **A: Te whakatuwheratanga o ō rātou matapihi waka (The opening of their carriage windows)**: The passage states the crowd forced the King and Queen to open their carriage windows, so this WAS inflicted upon them.

*   **C: He tirohanga mo te pane o te kaitiaki (A viewing of the head of the guard)**: The passage mentions a member of the crowd waving the head of a royal guard in front of the horrified Queen, so this WAS inflicted upon them.

*   **D: He haere ki Parihi (A journey to Paris)**: The passage clearly states they were forced to go to Paris, so this WAS inflicted upon them.

*   **B: He putanga ohorere mai i Versailles (A sudden departure from Versailles)**: While their departure from Versailles was sudden and forced, the act of *departing* itself wasn't something they were directly forced to *do* (like opening windows). It was the consequence of the crowd's actions.

Therefore, option B is the action that was NOT directly inflicted upon the King and Queen."
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te hua o te pakanga moana kore noa o Ingarangi?,"The passage states that the German unrestricted submarine warfare was a direct response to the British naval blockade. The other options are not consequences of British naval warfare. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: Kāore i te taea te whakawātea i ngā rawa nui** (Large amounts of supplies could not be delivered)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kei te hiahia a Tiamana ki te whakamahi i ngā tikanga pakanga ōrite** (Germany wants to use equal war tactics): This is a direct result of the British blockade, as Germany's unrestricted submarine warfare was retaliation.
*   **B: I tūkinotia nga kaipuke kāore i te tūkinotia** (Non-military ships were attacked): This is implied by the statement that the British blockade violated international law, which was designed to protect neutral shipping.
*   **C: I mahia he huringa ki te ture o te ao whānui** (A change was made to general international law): The passage mentions that the British blockade violated existing international law."
Ko tehea kōrero e kore e tino whakaahua i te aukati moana a Ingarangi ki Tiamana?,"The correct answer is **D: I whakarite kia kaua e whakawehia ngā kaipuke tōrangapū** (Ensured that political ships were not threatened).

Here's why:

*   **P states:** The passage explicitly states the British blockade violated international law.
*   **P states:** The passage connects the blockade to Germany's unrestricted submarine warfare.
*   **P states:** The passage mentions the blockade cut off supplies to Germany.
*   **The absence of a guarantee for the safety of political ships:** The passage only mentions that Britain mined international waters endangering neutral ships.

Therefore, option D is the only one that is NOT accurately reflected in the provided passage.
"
"I runga anō i te haerenga, ko wai e tino pai ai te tātaitanga o te Sclerosis Maha?","The correct answer is **A: He wāhine 32 tau te pakeke**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states MS is a leading neurological disease in young to middle-aged adults.
*   It also states that women are twice as likely to be affected by MS than men.
*   Therefore, the most likely candidate from the options provided would be a young to middle-aged woman."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, e hiahiatia ana e ngā kaiuru i roto i ngā ngohe auau he tautoko anō mō te aha?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **A: Te kitenga tōraro o te mamae**.

E ai ki te rerenga whakamutunga o te whakatau P, ""Ko te hunga e whai wāhi ana ki te oi auau ka nui ake te tautoko ka hiahiatia e pā ana ki te tirohanga kino o te mamae..."" (Those who participate in frequent exercise are more likely to need support regarding the negative perception of pain...).
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he pēhea te tākaro o te taiapa?","The correct answer is **D: I roto i tētahi hōputu duel**.

The passage states: ""Kei te mātua tākarotia tēnei hākinakina ki te takotoranga takirua, arā ko tētahi fencer e whawhai ana ki tētahi atu."" This translates to: ""This sport is mainly played in a dual format, that is one fencer fighting another."" A ""takotoranga takirua"" and ""tētahi fencer e whawhai ana ki tētahi atu"" both indicate a duel format.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: I roto i tētahi hōputu hōu (In a new format)**: The passage doesn't mention a new format.
*   **B: I te taumata o te whare wānanga (At the university level)**: The passage mentions university students who fence, but it doesn't say that is the *only* way it is played.
*   **C: I te taumata Olympic (At the Olympic level)**: Similar to B, the passage mentions Olympic competition, but this is not the *only* or main format of play."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei te tohu tino kaha o te mate paitini o roto?","The correct answer is **D: He pounamu pire rongoā**.

The passage states: ""Ko te tohu pai rawa o te paihana ā-roto ko te noho ki reira a tētahi ipu tuwhera o te rongoā, o ngā matū ā-whare tāoke rānei."" This translates to ""The best sign of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic household substances."" This directly corresponds to option D.

The other options describe symptoms that, while possible indicators, are not as definitive as finding the source of the poison.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te hipanga tuatahi tika ina arotake ana i tētahi tūkino?","The correct answer is **A: Tirohia te tirohanga**.

The passage states: ""i te tuatahi me tiro koe ki te wāhi kia whakarite ka haumaru koe"" which translates to ""first you must look at the location to ensure you are safe"".  ""Tirohia te tirohanga"" directly translates to ""Check the scene/situation"".
"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e kore e tino whakaatu i te tukanga o te tirotiro i te patunga?,"The correct answer is **A: Kaua e māharahara ki te tautāwhi i ō ake mate**.

Here's why:

*   **P** explicitly states the importance of ensuring your own safety before assisting the victim. Saying ""Kaua e māharahara ki te tautāwhi i ō ake mate"" (Don't worry about treating your own injuries) directly contradicts this crucial first step. The original passage focuses on self-preservation as being important.
The other options are mentioned in the passage
"
Ko tēhea o ngā huringa i puta mai i te French Revolution i whai pānga nui ki ngā tāngata mahi?,"Based on the passage (P), the most relevant change resulting from the French Revolution for working people is **B: He neke arotahi mai i te karaehe ki te māiatanga (A shift in focus from class to merit).**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that after the Revolution, jobs were open to all male candidates allowing the bold and capable to succeed. Furthermore, the military academies were judged by competence not class.

The other options are not the main thing it talked about in relation to working people, the other options are either wrong or not touched on.

Therefore, B is the most appropriate answer."
"I muri i te French Revolution, he iti ake te tūponotanga o te angitu i roto i te ope taua me ētahi atu mahi i runga i te aha?","The correct answer is **B: Tauaha**

**Explanation:**

The passage states that after the French Revolution, jobs were open to all male candidates who were able, meaning the most confident and powerful could win. It also mentions the military academies became based on merit, not rank. This implies that the social status or rank of the candidate was no longer the primary factor for success, but rather their own ability and effort.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tutukitanga:** While achievement is important, the passage suggests a shift away from inherited privilege.
*   **C: Te Hiahia:** The passage does imply that it is also about will, it is mostly about the person's ability to do the job.
*   **D: Kaliber:** This means calibre, this means quality. This does not make sense as it does not follow the argument in paragraph P.

Therefore, **Tauaha** (rank) is the most accurate answer, as the passage emphasizes the move away from inherited status determining success."
Ko tehea te mahi tūmatanui e kiia ana ko te mea nui rawa o te riri i roto i nga whenua whakawhanake?,"Based on the text, the correct answer is **C: waka tūmatanui**.

The passage states that people in developing countries complain a lot about ""pūnaha mauranga"" (transportation systems) and that complaints about water quality or bridge construction are less common in developed countries. ""Waka tūmatanui"" translates to public transport, which falls under the umbrella of ""pūnaha mauranga"". Therefore, public transport is the public service most associated with complaints in developing countries, according to the text.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te kōrero mo nga pūnaha whakawhiti tūmatanui?","The correct answer is **C: He maha ngā amuamu o te hunga e whakamahi ana i a rātau**.

The passage states: ""Ko te kato ka whai wāhi atu te kato ki ngā pūnaha mauranga. Ko te nuiga ka amuamu mō ngā pūnaha mauranga."" (Everyone uses transport systems. Most people complain about transport systems.) This directly supports option C.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he uaua ki te ine nā te kore āheitanga o ngā atekōkiri?","The passage states that ""it is difficult to study traffic flow because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty."" It also mentions the three key characteristics that are related to traffic flow: flow, density, and speed.

Therefore, the characteristic that is difficult to measure is the **Rere Waka (Traffic Flow)**.

So the answer is **D**.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whakamahia ana ina whakaatu ana i tētahi rerenga waka i runga i te pāngarau?,"The correct answer is **D: kiato o nga waka**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Kia pai ake te whakaatu i te rerenga waka, kua whakatūria ngā hononga i waenganui i ngā āhuatanga matua e toru: (1) te rere, (2) te apiapi, ā, (3) te tere."" *apiapi* translates to density, or ""kiato"". While the passage also mentions ""mahinga huarahi"" (road operation) and ""hoahoa huarahi"" (road design), it explicitly states that the mathematical representation of traffic flow is based on the relationships between flow, density, and speed. ""whanonga atekōkiri"" (driver behavior) is also mentioned, but it is stated that it cannot be reliably predicted, but is an important consideration when modelling the traffic flow.
"
He aha te mea i whakamahia e Hershey rāua ko Chase hei tāuru i tō rāua DNA? ,"The correct answer is **D: huaketo**.

The passage states: ""I whakamahingia e Hershey me Chase ngā wāhanga, ngā huaketo rānei hei whakauru i ō rātou ake pītau ira ki roto ki tētahi kitakita."" This directly indicates that Hershey and Chase used viruses to inject their genetic material.
"
E whakawhirinaki ana ki te aha te kaha o te huringa ki te tuku ki te uri?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **A: Mēnā he rārangi-ā-rārangi ngā pūtau**.

**He whakamārama:**

E ai ki te kōrero P, ko ngā **rerekētanga anake ki ngā raina-ira** ka tukuna ki te hunga tamariki. Ko te tikanga o ""raina-ira"" ko ngā pūtau whakaputa uri (pērā i ngā pūtau kōkiri me ngā pūtau hua). Mēnā ka puta te huringa ki ēnei pūtau, ka tukuna ki te uri. Mēnā ka puta te huringa ki ētahi atu pūtau (pērā i ngā pūtau kiri, ngā pūtau ate, me ētahi atu pūtau tinana), kāore e tukuna ki te uri.
"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i hoatu i roto i te wāhanga nei, he aha te kore e whakawhirinaki ki ngā pānga rerekē o ngā huringa?","The correct answer is **A: He aha te nui o te rauemi iranga e pā ana**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""He maha ngā momo iranoi, kei runga i tōna momo e kitea ai ka pēhea e raru ai, ko te hihiri o te momo ira kua pāngia, ā, mēnā rānei he momo meroiti ngā ira e pāngia ana."" This translates to ""There are many types of mutations, depending on their type, you can see how they are affected, the importance of the affected gene, and whether small genes are affected.""

* **Why A is the answer:** The passage explicitly says the effect of a mutation depends on the ""importance of the affected gene"" (te hihiri o te momo ira kua pāngia) and whether ""small genes are affected"" (mēnā rānei he momo meroiti ngā ira e pāngia ana). This translates to size of the gene being affected.

* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Mēnā he rārangi-ā-rārangi ngā pūtau pāngia (Whether the affected cells are arranged in a sequence):** The passage doesn't discuss the arrangement of the affected cells.
    * **C: Te tikanga o te rawa iranga pāngia (The meaning of the affected genetic material):** The question is about the scope of the effect, not the meaning behind genetic material.
    * **D: Te momo irakētanga pāngia (The type of mutation affected):** The passage already assumes that the *type* of mutation is known when assessing its effects.

Therefore, the size of the gene affected (or the amount of genetic material involved) is a crucial factor in determining the effects of a mutation, as stated in the passage."
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te take i mau ai ngā iwi o mua i ngā koati?,"Based on the passage:

The passage states that goats were domesticated for:

*   Milk
*   Wool
*   Meat
*   Hides (kirimoko)

The passage also describes how they graze on mountains and pastures.

Therefore, the reason **NOT** mentioned in the passage is:

**C: I tukua e rātau he hoa (They provided companionship)**.
"
Ko te whāinga o te korowha ko te tango i te iti rawa o te aha?,"The correct answer is **B: Stokes**.

The passage states: ""Ko te kaitākaro ka iti rawa āna tarawete, āna tiu ki te haupōro rānei, ki te whakaoti i te autaki ka toa.""  ""Tarawete"" and ""tiu"" are translations for 'strokes'. Therefore, the goal is to have the fewest strokes.
"
"I runga i te papa korowha, kei hea te tapahi i te tarutaru?","The correct answer is **B: Kei runga i te kākāriki**.

The passage states that the grass is shorter near the hole, and this area is called the ""kākāriki"" (green).
"
He aha te whāinga o tētahi whakamātautau?,"The correct answer is **A: Hei whakakore i tētahi, neke atu rānei o ngā ariā pea**.

The passage explicitly states: ""ko te mātaitanga ko tētahi whakamātautau e whakamahia ana hei whakakore i te whakapae kotahi, neke atu rānei ka taea...""  This directly corresponds to option A.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te kore e āwhina ki te ārahi i te rangahau pūtaiao?","The correct answer is **A: Ko te tikanga pūtaiao anake**.

Here's why:

*   **P states:** The scientific method *as well as* observation, experimentation, questioning, and analysis are all used to guide scientific research.
*   **A** suggests that only the scientific method is used
*   **B, C, and D** are all mentioned in the prompt as factors which guide scientific research.

"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea kōrero mo nga āwhiowhio ehara i te tika?","The correct answer is **C: Neke atu i te toru haora te nuinga o nga āwhiowhio**.

The passage states that *the strongest* tornadoes can last for over three hours. It does *not* say that the majority of tornadoes last this long. Therefore, statement C is the incorrect one based on the given text.
"
"I runga anō i te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e tino tika ana te whakaahua i te nuinga o ngā hau?","The correct answer is **D: Ka taea e rātau te hutia ngā rākau i te whenua** (They can uproot trees from the ground).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ka hūtia ngā rākau e te āwhawhiowhio..."" (Tornadoes uproot trees...).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate based on the provided text:

* **A: I te nuinga o te wā ka roa ake i te toru haora** (They usually last longer than three hours): The passage says *the strongest* tornadoes can last over three hours, not that most do.
* **B: Ka waihangahia e rātau he hau e pā ana ki te 480 maero i te haora** (They create winds of about 480 miles per hour): The passage states the wind speed reaches up to 480 *kilometers* per hour, not miles.
* **C: He nui ake ngā wāhi e pā ana ki a rātau i ētahi atu tupuhi** (They affect more areas than other storms): The passage states that tornadoes affect a small area relative to other storms.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate based on the information given.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei mea i tīmata te tangata ki te mahi i te rau tau 16?,"The correct answer is **D: Hanga whātata**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that magnifying lenses have been around for thousands of years.
*   It specifically mentions that true telescopes were invented in Europe in the late 16th century.

Therefore, the only activity that started in the 16th century, according to the passage, is building telescopes."
Kua pehea te roa o te whakamahinga o te tangata i te whakarahi i ngā ahanoa mā te whakamahi i ngā karu?,"The correct answer is **C: Mo nga mano tau**.

The passage states that humans have been making and using magnifying lenses for thousands of years.
"
"I runga i te waahanga, he aha te korero a te ana o Muhammad mo ana mahi wairua, tikanga ranei?","Ko te whakautu tika ko: **A: E uara ana a ia ki te rangimārie me te taratahitanga**

Nei rā te take:

*   E kī ana te tuhinga i noho a Muhammad ki te ana kia ""āta whakaaro"" me te mea ""kāore he paku aha ka kitea tēnā i te rangi paki o runga me ngā tini pae maunga e karapoti nei. He iti noa o te ao nei ka kitea ka rangona rānei mai i roto i te ana."" E tohu ana ēnei kōrero i te hiahia o Muhammad ki te noho mokemoke, ki te karo i ngā whakararuraru o te ao, kia taea ai e ia te aro ki ana mahi wairua.

Kāore i te tika ngā whiringa kē atu:

*   **B: Ka āwhina te haruru o waho ki te whakaaroaro:** E kī ana te tuhinga i te rere kē o tēnei, he marino te wāhi, kia āta whakaaroaro ai ia.
*   **C: He iti noa iho te wā e hiahiatia ana e ia:** Kāore he kōrero mō te roanga o te wā i noho ai ia ki reira.
*   **D: I hiahia a ia kia kitea, kia rangona:** E kī ana te tuhinga i te uaua o te kite i te ana, e tohu ana kāore ia i te hiahia kia kitea."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te rino i whakamahia mo te tuatahi?","The correct answer is **D: Ngā rera**.

The passage states: ""Nāwai rā, heoi anō, i āta kitea i te painga kē atu o ngā ara mēnā i he wāhanga mētara iti ki runga."" This translates to ""Later, however, it was realised that the tracks were more beneficial if there was a small metal piece on top."" This implies that the rails (ngā ara) were the first application of metal. The passage goes on to specify this metal was iron, with ""I te tau 1767, i kitea tuatahitia ngā ara tereina tuatahi he rino-katoa"" translating to ""In 1767, the first all-iron railway tracks were first discovered"".
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha i whakakapia ai nga wīra rākau e nga wīra rino?","The correct answer is **D: I te mau rātau i te rino i runga i nga ara**.

The passage states that the iron rails caused ""kaha ake te taiākotikoti ki ngā wīra wāpu o ngā wēkana"" (more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons). Therefore, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels because they were more durable against the iron rails.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te āhua o te tangata i te wā o te Romanticism?","The correct answer is **B: Papawhenua (Land)**.

The passage states that ""in the context of Romanticism, **land/geography** influenced the person..."" ( ""Ki te horopaki o te Romanticism, **nā te takotoranga papa** te tangata i aweawe..."").  ""Takotoranga papa"" translates to something like ""geographical layout"" or ""land formation,"" and ""papa"" is used here to mean land/geography. While the other options (ritenga/customs, ahurea/culture, and ture/laws) are related to the text, the passage directly identifies land/geography as the influencing factor on individuals during Romanticism.
"
Ko tēhea o ngā kīanga e whai ake nei e kore e whakaata i tētahi ariā whānui o te whakatau hangarau? ,"The passage describes technological determinism as the idea that:

1.  Technology develops independently of cultural or political influence.
2.  Technology has inherent and inevitable impacts on society, rather than the meaning of technology being socially constructed.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Ko ngā pānga o te hangarau ki te hapori he āhuatanga pāpori (The impacts of technology on society are a social construct):** This directly contradicts technological determinism, which claims technology has inherent impacts, not socially constructed ones.
*   **B: Kāore te ahurea e whakaawe i te whanaketanga o te hangarau (Culture does not influence the development of technology):** This aligns with technological determinism, which says technology develops independently of culture.
*   **C: He pānga tūturu tō te hangarau ki te iwi (Technology has a real impact on people):** This also aligns with technological determinism, emphasizing the inherent impacts of technology.
*   **D: Kāore te whanaketanga hangarau e hāngai ana ki te mana tōrangapū (Technological development is not subject to political power):** This aligns with technological determinism, stating technology is independent of political influence.

Therefore, the statement that *does not* reflect a core tenet of technological determinism is **A: Ko ngā pānga o te hangarau ki te hapori he āhuatanga pāpori (The impacts of technology on society are a social construct)** because it argues that the impacts of technology are shaped by society, which is the opposite of technological determinism."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i te pāhono ki te tō i te kopere?","The correct answer is **A: He oro ngohengohe ake**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that an ""up-bow"" often creates a softer sound, while a ""down-bow"" creates a louder, more forceful sound. So, a softer sound is associated with an up-bow, not a down-bow.

The other options are all characteristics of a down-bow according to the text:

*   **B: He tohu e āhua nei he tēpara** (The down-bow symbol resembles a trapezoid)
*   **C: He oro kaha ake** (The down-bow produces a stronger sound)
*   **D: Tīmata ana i te poroka** (The down-bow starts at the frog)"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e pāhono ana ki te oro mārire ake?","The correct answer is **C: He tohu e āhua nei he V**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""I te nuinga o te wā ka puta te oro māriri ake i tētahi kōpere-ki runga...""
*   It also says: ""Ko te āhua o te tohu """"kōpere ki runga"""" ko tētahi V...""

Therefore, a ""V"" shaped symbol corresponds to a softer sound.
"
E whakaatu ana ngā kōhatu i ngā ringa i te mutunga ka huri hei whakamahi i te nuinga mō te aha?,"The correct answer is **A: Māwhai**.

The passage states that hominid hands evolved *away* from locomotion (like knuckle-walking) and towards manipulation.  ""Rāwekenga"" translates to ""manipulation."" Therefore, the bones show a shift toward using hands mostly for manipulation.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kōrero e tino whakaahua ana i ngā kōhao o te chimpanzee? ,"The correct answer is **C: E whakamahia ana mō te mau taimaha**.

Here's why:

*   **P: Kaore e pēnei i ngā paraimete kē atu, kāore ngā homonids e whakamahi i ī rātou ringa ināianei ki te tima rerewē, kia hiki taumaha, ki tārere rānei i ngā rākau.** This states that unlike other primates, hominids don't use their hands to carry weight.
*   **He rite tahi te rahinga o te ringa me te waewae o te Chimpanzee, e ataata nei ko te whakamahinga o te ringa hei kawe i te taumaha mō te hīkoi i ngā matimati.** This directly states that chimpanzees use their hands to bear weight when walking on their knuckles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: He hāngai ake rātau i te tangata:** The passage states that human phalanges are straighter, implying chimpanzee phalanges are less straight.
*   **B: He rerekē te rahi o ō rātou ringa me ō rātou waewae:** The passage explicitly says chimpanzee hands and feet are the same size.
*   **D: E whakamahia ana i te nuinga o te wā mō te whakahiato:** While chimpanzees might use their hands for manipulation, the passage primarily focuses on their weight-bearing function.
"
Ka tangohia e te tīpakonga ngā rerekētanga iranga hou mai i tēhea puna?,"The correct answer is **D: whakapuakina**.

The passage states: ""mā te kōwhiringa e wewete mai i te puna o te rerenga e putaputa ana,"" which translates to ""selection frees from the source of the expressed variance"".  ""Whakapuakina"" translates to ""expressed"". Therefore, selection removes variance from the *expressed* pool.
"
He aha te tukanga e whai mana ana ki te tāpiri i te rerekētanga iranga?,"The passage states ""Mā te irakē e tāpiri te rerenga ira hou..."".  ""Irakē"" translates to ""mutation"". Therefore, the correct answer is C: irakētanga (mutation).
"
"I runga anō i te mōhiohio i roto i te wāhanga, ko tēhea o ēnei e tika ana kia kai te primate hei whakaoti i tētahi raruraru “raruraru pūmua”?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **C: Nga mawhitiwhiti**.

E ai ki te wāhanga, he uaua mō te whāngote waewae-rua te nakunaku i ngā pūmua i roto i ngā rau me ngā rākau pī ki te kore e tunua.  Engari, he māmā ki te nakunaku i te kai kararehe pēnei i te pōpokorua, ngārara, me te hēkī, ā, he nui te pūmua me ngā waikawa amino kei roto.  I te mea ko ngā mawhitiwhiti he kai kararehe (ngārara), ā, he māmā ki te nakunaku, nā koinei te kōwhiringa e tika ana.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā raruraru e whai ake nei kāore i te puta mai i te kore o ngā waikawa amino hira?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **B: Te mate o te kai**.

E ai ki te whiti, ko ngā raruraru e puta mai ana i te kore o ngā waikawa amino hira ko:

*   **Ngā raruraru o te whangai (A)**: I kīia, he uaua mō te whāngote waewae-rua te kapo i ngā waikawa amino mai i ngā hua o te tipu.
*   **Tupu pōhara (C)**: I kīia, ki te kore e rawaka ngā waikawa amino, ka pēhia te tipunga.
*   **Mate (D)**: I kīia, ki te kore e rawaka ngā waikawa amino, ka ngoikore te taikaha, ā, nā wai rā ka hemo.

Kāore te whiti i te kōrero tika mō te mate o te kai i te kore o ngā waikawa amino hira. Ko te aro nui ko te uaua ki te whiwhi i ngā waikawa amino mai i ngā puna tipu i te hawana, me ngā pānga o te kore e rawaka o ngā waikawa amino ki te tipu me te oranga.

Me pēhea te tikanga o ngā mema o tētahi ahurea iti ki te tohu i tō rātou hononga ki taua rōpū?,"Based on the passage provided, the correct answer is:

**D: Mā te whakamahi i te kāhua hei momo tohu**

The passage states: ""He auau te tohu a ngā mema o tētahi ahurea āpiti i tā rātou whai wāhitanga mā tētahi whakamahinga āhua he rerekē, he tohu, kei roto ko ngā āhua, ngā tū, ko ngā huinga kupu."" This directly translates to members of a subculture often signify their membership through a style (āhua) that is different and symbolic, including fashion (āhua), gestures (tū), and slang (ngā huinga kupu). Therefore, using style as a form of signaling is explicitly mentioned as a way members of a subculture mark their affiliation.

"E ai ki te ariā e whakaaturia ana i roto i te wāhanga, he aha te mea ka tupu ki te tamaiti e tohu ana ki te iwi iti e whakaarohia ana mo te mahi i te whanonga whakawehi?","The passage states that children identified with a minority group who perform poorly in school often *improve* their performance when they become aware of the oppression of their group. This suggests that awareness of oppression can lead to a positive change in behavior, not a negative one.

Therefore, none of the options directly align with the argument presented. However, the closest and most likely answer is:

**B: Ka nui ake pea te tūponotanga o te tamaiti ki te whanonga whakawehi**

**Reasoning:**

*   The passage suggests that children become aware of oppression. Awareness can lead to anger and frustration.
*   In some cases, these feelings could manifest as rebellious or aggressive behavior (whakawehi), especially if the child feels powerless or marginalized.

Therefore, while not explicitly stated, it is an *increased* likelihood of negative behavior and aggressive tendencies.
"
"E ai ki te whārangi, ko te mōhio o te tamaiti ki ngā āhuatanga ā-iwi ka whai pānga ki tēhea o ēnei?","The correct answer is **B: to rātau whanonga (their behavior)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ā, ka whakatūkino ēnei kitenga i te whanonga."" This directly translates to ""and these experiences can influence behavior.""
* **The example provided further illustrates this:** Children who are part of a marginalized ethnic group and aware of the discrimination against their group may perform differently in school (a change in behavior).

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Ko te iwi iti e whiriwhiria ana e rātau hei tohu (The minority group they choose to identify with):** The passage assumes they already belong to a minority group. The knowledge of ethnic realities influences how they *behave* within that identity, not which identity they choose.
* **C: Ko ō rātou hononga ki ētahi atu tamariki (Their relationships with other children):** While their behavior *could* affect their relationships, the passage directly focuses on the impact on behavior itself.
* **D: Ko tā rātou tautuhinga o te iwi (Their identification with ethnicity):** Similar to A, the passage implies they already have an ethnic identity. The knowledge affects how they act within that identity, not the initial identification.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tehea o ēnei e kore e ōrite ki te whakatipu i tētahi tamaiti mohoao?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā pūkenga kōrerorero kaha (Strong communication skills)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that children raised in isolation, neglected, or abused often exhibit behaviors similar to the animals that raised them, including fear and indifference towards humans.
*   The text explains that feral children may be impacted by mistreatment, neglect or trauma.

Since feral children lack human interaction and care, they would not develop strong communication skills. The other options (living in isolation, having delayed development, and experiencing social anxiety) are all characteristics that would be consistent with the description of feral children."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kupu e whai ake nei e whakaahua tika ana i te whanonga mohoao o ngā tamariki?","The correct answer is **B: Ko te whanonga mohoao ka puta mai i te kore o te whakahoahoa** (Feral behavior results from a lack of socialization).

Here's why:

* **The passage directly links ""feral"" children to a lack of socialization.** The passage explains that feral children, whether abandoned, neglected, abused, or raised by animals, exhibit behaviors characteristic of their circumstances. If raised by animals, they display behaviors similar to the animal guardian. This emphasizes the lack of human interaction and the resulting absence of normal human social development. The passage states ""Ina whakatipuria katoatia e te kararehe ehara i te tangata, ka whakaatu te tamaiti mohoao i ngā whanonga (i roto tonu i ngā here ā-kiko) kei te pērā katoa i ērā o te kararehe-tiaki ake"" this suggests the child is missing key components of socialization from humans.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **A: Ko te nuinga o te whanonga feral i takea mai i te āhuatanga ōkiko** (Most feral behavior stems from a physical condition). While the passage mentions physical constraints and the possibility of mental or physical disabilities leading to abandonment, it's not the primary cause of feral behavior. The core issue is the lack of socialization.
*   **C: Ko te whanonga mohoao e tino kitea ana i roto i ngā tamariki kua herea e ō rātou mātua** (Feral behavior is most evident in children restrained by their parents). Restraining children is mentioned as one form of abuse/neglect, but it's not presented as the most common or definitive cause of feral behavior. The passage highlights a range of situations including abandonment, neglect, and animal rearing.
*   **D: Ko ngā whanonga mohoao katoa e pā ana ki ngā ngoikoretanga hinengaro nui** (All feral behaviors are related to severe mental deficiencies). The passage suggests that it is possible that cognitive challenges can influence a child's abandonment, it is only suggested and not considered the rule.

"I runga anō i te wāhanga, ko tēhea o ngā mahi e whai ake nei e kore e ōrite ki te ahuwhenua whaiaro?","The correct answer is **C: Te arotahi ki te hua nui hei utu mō ngā tikanga matatau**.

Here's why:

*   **Ahuwhenua mō te hapori (Subsistence farming) focuses on producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.** Option A aligns with this definition.

*   **The passage describes it as a simple system often using natural seeds and basic methods.** Options B, C, and D talk about the contrast to that.

*   **Option C describes focusing on high yield through advanced methods.** Subsistence farming typically uses simpler, less intensive methods.

*   **Option B: Te hanga kai hei hoko ki ētahi atu** (Producing food to sell to others) - This is not the focus of subsistence farming, which is primarily for self-sufficiency.

*   **Option D: E mau kākano ana ki te rohe o te kaiahuwhenua** (Maintaining seeds to the land of the farmer) - This fits with the description in the passage about using natural seeds to that location.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whakaahua tika ana i te mahi ahuwhenua?,"The correct answer is **D: E whakamahia tonu ana e ngā kaiahuwhenua i ētahi whenua.**

Here's why:

* **P** states that subsistence farming ""e pēnei tonu ana ki ngā tini whenua e whanake ana"" (is still the case in many developing countries). This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: He pūnaha tino rauropi:** While P says subsistence farming is ""i te nuinga o te wā he māori"" (mostly natural), it doesn't say it's *always* or *necessarily* highly ecological.
* **B: E whakamahi ana i ngā tikanga ahurei hei whakanui i ngā hua:** P mentions ""huringa hua, ki ētahi atu tikanga āhua māmā"" (crop rotation, and other simple techniques). While these are techniques to increase yields, the passage emphasizes their simplicity rather than them being unique. Also, the *primary* goal isn't necessarily maximum yield, but enough to feed the family.
* **C: Ka āhei te hunga ahuwhenua ki te tohatoha i ō rātou hua puta noa i tō rātou rohe:** P states that the purpose is to grow enough food to ""tutuki anake i ngā hiahia o te kaiahuwhenua rātou ko tōna whānau"" (only meet the needs of the farmer and their family). This implies little or no surplus for distribution beyond the immediate family.
"
Ko te haere ki tētahi whare taonga ka uru ki roto ki te momo tūruhi?,"The correct answer is **C: Tāpoi ahurea**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that tourism focused on learning about a place's history or culture is known as cultural tourism (""Mehemea ko te whāinga o te toronga ki tētahi wāhi ko te whai mōhio e pā ana ki tana hītori, ki tana ahurea, kei te mōhiotia tēnei momo tāpoi hei tāpoi ahurea."")
*   Visiting a museum falls under learning about a place's history and culture.

Let's eliminate the other options:

*   **A: Te tūruhi pakihi (Business tourism):** This involves travel for work-related purposes.
*   **B: Turuhi whakangahau (Leisure tourism):** While museums can be enjoyable, the primary motivation is educational and cultural enrichment, not purely leisure.
*   **D: Te tūruhi o waho (Outdoor tourism):** This involves activities like hiking, camping, or adventure sports."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha pea te mea tuatahi mo te hunga haere whakangahau?","The correct answer is **B: E okioki ana i a rātau mahi o ia rā**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Koinei tā te tangata haere ki tētahi wāhi he tino rerekē i ā rātou mahi o ia rā hei whakatā, hei ngahau."" (This is when people travel to a place very different from their daily routine to relax and have fun). This directly links leisure tourism to resting from daily work.

The other options are related to cultural tourism, not general leisure tourism:

*   A and D specifically describe cultural tourism, which is a different type of tourism mentioned later in the passage.
*   C is part of the act of cultural tourism but not the main focus of general/leisure tourism."
He aha te mea e whakahuatia ana i roto i te wāhanga hei mea i āwhina ki te whakaiti i te wehi ki te huringa i roto i te hahi o te rohe?,"The correct answer is **A: Te maumahara ki ngā tauira angitu o te whanonga pakihi** (Remembering successful examples of business behavior).

The passage states: ""I tēnei wā, mā te maumahara ki ngā mahinga o mua a ngā whanonga rakahinonga me ngā angitu i hua mai, i āwhina i ngā tāngata kia noho tuwhera ki ngā panoni hou..."" which translates to: ""At this time, by remembering past actions of business behaviors and the successes that resulted, it helped people to be open to new changes..."" This directly supports option A.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te āwhina o te mōhio ki te hītori o tētahi?","The correct answer is **A: Te whakaiti i te wehi ki te huringa**.

The passage states: ""Nā ngā kōrero angitu pēnei i heke haere ngā mataku mō te panoni, waihoki ka hangaia ngā aronga pai ki te panoni mō te wā e heke mai ana.""  This directly translates to: ""Successful stories like this reduce fears about change, and also create positive attitudes towards change for the future.""

Therefore, knowing the history helps to reduce fear of change.

Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e whakaahua tika ana i te huarahi whai muri o te mātauranga?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **D: Kāore he tino tikanga i roto i te ako**.

Anei te take:

*   Ko te tuhinga e korero ana mo te tirohanga postmodern ki te akoranga e whakanui ana i te wāteatanga (flexibility) me te whanaungatanga (subjectivity). E whakaaro ana kaore he huarahi kotahi pai hei ako, kaore hoki he mea kotahi pai hei ako. Ka whakanui te tuhinga i te wheako whaiaro me te kore e whaihua o te ako i etahi wa (i te mea e matakitaki ana tatou i nga kaupapa pouaka whakaata e whakaatu ana i nga mea e kore e pa ki a tatou).

*   Ko te whakautu ""Kāore he tino tikanga i roto i te ako"" e hopu ana i tenei whakaaro, e kii ana kaore he tikanga kotahi e whakahaere ana i te ako.

He aha i kore ai e tika nga whiringa ke atu:

He aha ai:

*   **Te wetewete i te whārangi (P):** E kōrero ana te whārangi mō te aronga postmodern ki te akoranga, e whakapae ana kāore he huarahi kotahi pai hei ako, kāore hoki he mea kotahi pai hei ako. E hāngai ana te akoranga ki te wheako i waenganui i te ākonga me te mātauranga. Ka whakamāramahia tēnei mā te tauira o ngā hōtaka pouaka whakaata ā-ako, e whakaatu ana ka taea e te tangata te ako i ngā mea kāore ia e whai wāhi atu.

*   **Te tātari i ngā kōwhiringa:**
    *   **A: He maha ngā huarahi ako mōhiohio:** E tautoko ana tēnei i te aronga postmodern e kī ana kāore he huarahi kotahi pai hei ako.
    *   **B: Me matua whakawhiwhia ētahi wheako ako ki ētahi atu:** E whakaatu ana tēnei i te aronga motuhake, ko ētahi wheako ako e whai hua ake ana i ētahi atu. Ka tautohe tēnei ki te aronga postmodern e kī ana he mea nui te wheako o te ākonga ki te mātauranga, ahakoa he mea tika te wheako ki a ia.
    *   **C: Ko te wheako ako e whakawhirinaki ana ki te ākonga me te mātauranga i whakaaturia:** E tautoko ana tēnei i te aronga postmodern e aro ana ki te hononga i waenganui i te ākonga me te mātauranga.
    *   **D: Ko te mātauranga e kore pea e taea te whakamahi, he mea tika tonu kia ako:** E tautoko ana tēnei i te whakaaro kāore he ""mea pai"" hei ako, ka taea hoki te ako i ngā mea ahakoa kāore e whakamahia.

No reira, ko te kōwhiringa B e kore e whakaatu tika i tētahi huarahi ako whai muri i te ao hou, i runga i te whārangi i homai."
"I muri i te whakaoho i te wā o te moe noa, ko tēhea o ēnei e ārai i te tukanga whakaware i te moe?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **C: Whakaweto ana i te pūoho i tō pō, a, ka hoki whakamuri ki te moe e rua tekau meneti ā muri ake.**

E ai ki te kōrero i te P, ko te tikanga o te kokoti moe ko te āta whakaoho i te wā noa o tō moe, me te hoki ki te moe tētahi wā poto whai muri ake. Ki te whakaweto koe i te pūoho, ka hoki tonu koe ki te moe, ehara i te mea e āta whakaoho ana koe i a koe, ā, ehara i te mea e whakatā ana koe i waenganui i te oho me te moe."
Ko tehea o ēnei kōrero e kore e tika te whakaahua i te whakaware i te moe?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko te **D: Whai muri i te whakaara, ko te whāinga kia moe anō i roto i ngā haora e rua**.

E ai ki te tuhinga i runga, ko te whāinga i muri i te whakaoho i a koe ko te hoki ki te moe i roto i te wā poto (10-60 meneti), ehara i te haora e rua."
"I te mea e ngana ana te roro ki te moemoea mārama i te nuinga o te wā, he aha te mea ka nui ake?","The passage states: ""ko te hua o ngā moemoeā mārama e whakaroa ana i te roanga o te wā i waenga i ngā āhuatanga REM."" (the result of lucid dreaming extends the duration of time *between* REM phases).

The question asks what increases when the brain tries to lucid dream more often. The passage then says that ""I runga i te hekenga iho o ngā REM ia pō..."" (the decrease of REM phases each night...)

This implies that if lucid dreaming attempts increase, the time BETWEEN REM phases *increases*, while the actual *number* of REM phases *decreases*.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Wā i waenga i ngā āhuatanga REM** (Time between REM phases).
"
Ko tehea o ngā pānga kino e whai ake nei ka pā ki te tinana i ngā moemoea mārama maha?,"The correct answer is **B: Te heke o te REM ia pō** (The decrease of REM per night).

The passage states: ""I runga i te hekenga iho o ngā REM ia pō, ko tēnei āhua ka tino pāngia koe e te moe tūturu..."" (Due to the decrease of REM each night, this state will greatly affect you getting real sleep...)

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te ōritetanga o ngā kapa tuku iho me ngā kapa mariko?","The passage states: ""E mau nei te taumata kōunga mō ngā roopū mariko ki ngā tīma taketake, heoi he rerekētanga iti nei."" This translates to ""The quality level for virtual teams is maintained with traditional teams, however there are minor differences.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **A: E tūmanakohia ana kia mahi ngā kapa e rua i te taumata kotahi** (Both teams are expected to perform at the same level)
"
"I runga anō i te wāhanga nei, he teka te kōrero e pā ana ki ngā rōpū tūturu me ngā rōpū tūturu?","Let's analyze each option based on the provided text:

*   **A: I te nuinga o te wā, he teitei ake te taumata o ngā kapa tuku iho** - The text states ""E mau nei te taumata kōunga mō ngā roopū mariko ki ngā tīma taketake, heoi he rerekētanga iti nei"" which means the quality level for virtual teams is similar to traditional teams, with only a small difference. Therefore this is False.

*   **B: He maha ngā wā e mahi ana ngā rōpū mariko hei wāhi whakapā mō ngā rōpū tuku iho** - The text states ""I ētahi wā ka noho ngā mema tīma mariko hei āhuatanga whakapākanga mō tō rātou rōpū ā-kiko tata"" which means virtual teams sometimes act as a point of contact for their physically present team. Therefore this is True.

*   **C: He iti ake te mana motuhake o ngā kapa tuku iho i ngā kapa mariko** - The text states ""I te nuinga o te wā he nui ake tō rātou tino rangatiratanga tēnā i ngā mema o ngā tīma noa"" which means they generally have more autonomy than members of regular teams. Therefore this is True.

*   **D: Ka whai hua ngā rōpū mariko i te rerekē o ngā rohe wā** - The text states ""i te mea ko ā rātou tīma ka hui kei te āhua o ngā rohe wā rerekē ka kore pea e māramatia e tā rātou kaiwhakahaere ā-rohe"" which means that their teams meet in the form of different time zones that their local manager may not understand. This is implying that they are disadvantaged by the difference in timezone. Therefore this is False.

The question asks which statement is FALSE. The correct answer is A and D. However, since the question only allows one answer, the next best answer would be D as it is less implied and more explicitly states virtual teams are disadvantaged because of timezone differences.

**Therefore, the best answer is D.**"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te mea e arotahi ana ki ngā ariā ihirangi?,"Based on the passage, the content theories focus on:

*   **What** motivates people (needs and desires).
*   How environment **shapes** actions
*   Innate wants, needs and desires.

Therefore, the option that **doesn't** fit with the focus of content theories is:

*   **A: E hiahia ana te hōu kia whai rawa i te pakeketanga** (Wanting wealth in adulthood)

**A** does not align with the passage, as it discusses one possible want or desire, which the passage indicates has been instilled in some people as they've reached adulthood.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te kaupapa o te ture o ngā tuatoru?,"The correct answer is **D: Whakatū ana i te raupapa i roto i tētahi whakaahua.**

The passage defines the rule of thirds as a guideline for creating interest while maintaining balance in a photograph, specifically by placing the subject at the intersection of lines dividing the image into thirds. Options A, B, and C all align with this:

*   **A: Te waihanga i tētahi raina taketake mō te wāhi e taea ai te tūnga** (Creating a baseline for where to position the subject) - This aligns with positioning the subject at the intersection points.
*   **B: Te hanga ora me te pūngao i roto i tētahi whakaahua** (Creating life and energy in a photograph) - This aligns with creating interest and making the image more dynamic.
*   **C: Te pupuri i te kaupapa ki tētahi wāhi motuhake, whai hua hoki** (Holding the subject in a special and effective place) - This aligns with positioning the subject at the intersection points to make it more prominent and impactful.

Option **D: Whakatū ana i te raupapa i roto i tētahi whakaahua** (Establishing order in a photograph) is not mentioned in the given passage defining the rule of thirds. While composition in general can contribute to order, the rule of thirds itself is focused more on creating visual interest and balance than strict order. Therefore, it's the correct answer."
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore e whakaahua i te hōputu whakaahua 35mm?,"The correct answer is **C: He rerekē te ōwehenga o ngā āhuatanga i te nuinga o ngā hōputu noa**

Here's why:

*   **A: Kei te whakanao tonu** - The passage states ""Kei te whakaputaina tonutia i tēnei wā"" (It is still being produced). So, this is a correct description.

*   **B: I tangohia e ngā hōputu kāmera matihiko** - The passage states ""ko te mea nui ko tōna ōwehenga aronga kua waahanga riro mai i ngā whakatakotoranga rongo whakaahua kāmera mamati"" (the main thing is that its aspect ratio has been partially adopted by digital camera formats), indicating digital cameras use its aspect ratio. So, this is a correct description.

*   **D: Ko te hōputu tino pūnoa tēnei i te ao** - The passage states ""ko te whakatakotoranga whakaahua ū noa rawa ki te ao ko te 35mm"" (the most common photography format in the world is 35mm). So, this is a correct description.

*   **C: He rerekē te ōwehenga o ngā āhuatanga i te nuinga o ngā hōputu noa** - This is incorrect. The passage implies the 3:2 aspect ratio of 35mm is common and has been adopted by digital formats. Therefore, this statement is false."

The passage states: ""Mā tēnei ka āhei ngā karaehe topa mō ngā pikitia ki tētahi momo kounga e rite ana ki ērā karaehe e hōmiromiro ana."" This directly translates to zoom lenses being able to achieve a picture quality similar to prime lenses as manufacturing quality improves. The other options are either incorrect or not supported by the passage.

Here's why:

*   **P** defines mysticism as seeking unity, identity, or understanding with a spiritual world, power, truth, or God. It emphasizes personal experience, inner knowledge, and direct insight into the nature of the divine.

While communal religious experiences *can* exist, the passage makes a point of saying the followers sometimes seek acts that nurture *their* experiences, which leans into the personal.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, tērā pea i tīmataria he iwi ahuwhenua?","The correct answer is **D: Māori i te tuawhenua**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""e marohi ana ngā taunakitanga hou ko te Moriori ko tētahi rōpū Māori nō te tuawhenua i heke atu i Aotearoa ki Rēkohu..."" which means ""...new evidence suggests that the Moriori were a group of mainland Māori who migrated from Aotearoa to Rēkohu...""

The question asks who likely started an agricultural society, and the passage says the Māori established an agricultural society.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko te rōpū i rapu i te moa ko nga tangata tuatahi o tēhea tauwāhi?","The correct answer is **B: Aotearoa**.

The passage states: ""e whakaponotia ana ko te iwi tuatahi ki Aotearoa ko te iwi Māori, i aruaru ai rātou te manu nui e kīa ana ko te Moa."" This directly translates to ""it was believed that the first people in New Zealand were the Māori, who hunted the large bird called the Moa.""

I roto i tehea āhuatanga ka whai hua te whakamahi i te tikanga Pureland o te origami ki te kōpaki?,"The correct answer is **D: Kotahi, e rua rānei ngā wā i whakamātauria e te kōpaki i mua i.**

Here's why:

*   **The passage states that Pureland origami was developed to help beginners and those with limited motor skills.** This implies that it's beneficial for those who are new to origami (and therefore have tried it only a few times).
*   **A is incorrect** because Pureland focuses on one fold at a time, not multiple folds at once.
*   **B is incorrect** as it's actually the opposite of why Pureland origami was created.
*   **C is incorrect** because Pureland origami avoids complex folds like reverse folds, which means it wouldn't be helpful."
Ko tehea o ēnei e kore e tika te whakaahua i te Pureland origami?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **A: E tika ana mō ngā kōpaki wheako.**

Ko te take i tika ai tēnei ko, e ai ki te kōrero kei runga ake nei, i whakawhanakehia te Pureland origami hei āwhina i ngā kaipōkai torehuruhuru, i ērā rānei he iti noa ngā pūkenga nekeneke. No reira, kāore e tika ana mō ngā kōpaki wheako engari e tika ana mō te hunga tīmatanga me te hunga e whai mate ana i ngā ringa. Ko ngā atu kōwhiringa kei te tautoko i te āhuatanga o Pureland origami.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea tauwāhi kāore i te pāhono ki te Tūmatanuitanga o te Awaawa o Indus?","The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

Here's why:

*   **Harappa:** The passage explicitly states that the civilization is sometimes referred to as the Harappan Civilization because Harappa was the first site excavated.
*   **Te Awa o Sarasvati:** The passage mentions the debate that the civilization might be named after the Sarasvati River instead of the Indus.
*   **Ngā rohe katoa i Afghanistan ki te raki-māraki:** The passage states that some areas of north-eastern Afghanistan are part of the Civilization.
*   **Te nuinga o Pakistan i tēnei rā:** The passage clearly indicates that the civilization encompasses most of modern-day Pakistan.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i whakahuatia hei ingoa pea mō te Bronze Age Civilization e kōrerotia ana i te wāhanga nei?,"The correct answer is **A: Te Iwi o Harappan**.

Here's why:

*   **Te Whanaketanga Indus-Sarasvati:** The passage mentions that some scholars suggest this name due to the possibility that the civilization was based in the now-dried Sarasvati River valleys.
*   **Te Whanaketanga o te Awa o Indus:** The passage states that the settlement flourished in the basins of the Indus River.
*   **Te Whanaketanga o te Raorao o Indus:** The passage states that the Indus Valley Civilization was a Bronze Age settlement in the northwestern Indian subcontinent.

The passage mentions the *Harappan Civilization* because Harappa was the first site excavated. However, it does not suggest the civilization was called the *Harappan People*."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he painga roa?","The correct answer is **A: mahi tahi me ētahi atu** (working together with others).

Here's why:

* **P: Ēnei mea te apo me te matapiko, he āhuatanga e kore nei e taea te karo.** (Greed and selfishness are unavoidable traits.)
* **Inā rā, i ngā wā e hora ana ngā painga, ka nui ake ngā painga mēnā ko te tokoiti e matapiko nei ka ora i ēnei painga.** (However, when benefits are distributed, the benefits are greater if the few who are selfish benefit from these benefits.)
* **Ko te tūmanako, ka whai mōhio te nuinga o ngā tāngata ko tā rātou kōwhiringa wā roa pai rawa ko te mahi ngātahi ki ētahi atu.** (The hope is that most people will realize that their best long-term choice is to work together with others.)

The final sentence explicitly states that working together with others is the best long-term choice. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.  The other options either promote short-term self-interest (which the passage acknowledges is inevitable but not ideal) or are not directly supported as long-term benefits in the passage.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei ka manakē pea tētahi tangata mēnā kei runga i ngā painga inamata tō rātou arotahi?","The passage discusses the inevitability of greed and short-sightedness (matapiko). It argues that while benefits are spread, it's more beneficial if the *few* who are short-sighted benefit. It then expresses the hope that most people will realize long-term cooperation is the best choice.

The question asks what someone focused on *immediate* benefits would likely prefer. Of the options:

*   **A: Kore noa iho (Nothing)** - This doesn't make sense in the context of seeking immediate benefit.
*   **B: Ngātahitanga (Solidarity/Unity)** - This implies a collective long-term strategy.
*   **C: Mahi Tahi (Cooperation/Collaboration)** - This also points to a collective and long-term approach.
*   **D: Whaiarotanga (Self-interest/Egotism)** - This aligns with focusing on immediate personal gain, mirroring ""matapiko"" (short-sightedness) and ""apo"" (greed).

Therefore, the answer is **D: Whaiarotanga (Self-interest/Egotism)**."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, nāna i hipa tētahi wāhanga nui o nga utu whawhai?","The passage states: ""I pēhia rātou kia utu tāke ki te whakahaere koroniara o Ngā Whenua Tōpū o Amerika hei tuku pūtea hei utu i tētahi wāhanga nui o ngā utu me te itareti o ngā hononga-moni...""  ""Rātou"" refers to the Filipinos. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: Te iwi o Filipino**
"
He aha te wā i mua i te wā o nga Templars?,"The correct answer is **C: Te Moata Waenga Ake (The Early Middle Ages)**.

The passage explicitly states ""I mua i te High Middle Ages ko te Early Middle Ages..."" (Before the High Middle Ages was the Early Middle Ages). Since the Templars existed during the High Middle Ages, the period *before* their time was the Early Middle Ages.
"
Ko tēhea wā i puta mai i muri i te pakeketanga o nga Templars?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā Pakeke o Waenganui tōmuri**.

The text states: ""I mua i te High Middle Ages ko te Early Middle Ages, ā, ka whāia e te Late Middle Ages..."" (Before the High Middle Ages was the Early Middle Ages, and it was followed by the Late Middle Ages...). Since the Templars were active during the High Middle Ages, the Late Middle Ages came after their time.
"
He aha te rongoā kāore i whakahuatia e whakamahia ana e nga tākuta me nga tākuta i te Emepaea o Roma?,"The correct answer is **A: Ko te maimoatanga o te mate āwangawanga whai-whakamarama mā ngā rongoā āwangawanga rerekē** (The treatment of anxiety with different anti-anxiety medications).

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions:
    *   Using opium (from poppy seeds) and scopolamine (from henbane seeds) for anesthesia.
    *   Treating gangrene.
    *   Using tourniquets and arterial clamps to stop bleeding.

*   While the passage discusses pain management and surgical techniques, it doesn't mention specific treatments for anxiety. Options B, C, and D are all mentioned directly or implied in the passage. Therefore, option A is the treatment NOT mentioned."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i takea mai i nga kōkiri i mahia i te papa rongoā i te wā o te Emepera o Roma?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **C: Te whakatūnga o ngā hōhipera ako**.

Ahakoa e kī ana te wāhanga i tīmata te taritari i ngā tākuta e Emperor Augustus (D), i tū rātou hei Roman Medical Corps tuatahi (A) mō te whakamahi i ngā pakanga (B, he āhuatanga mārō), kāore i te kōrero e pā ana ki te whakatūnga o ngā hōhipera ako.
"
E whakawhirinaki ana te kaha ki te kite ki te aha?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā okana pūoko pūnaha arokite**

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""Ko te kitenga, ko te pūkenga kia kite rānei e whirinaki ana ki ngā whēkau rongo pūnaha kitenga, ki ngā karu rānei rānei."" which directly translates to ""Seeing, or the ability to see, depends on the sensory organs of the visual system, or the eyes.""
* **Q asks:** ""E whakawhirinaki ana te kaha ki te kite ki te aha?"" which translates to ""What does the ability to see depend on?""

A is the only option that answers to the question asked in Q, which is extracted directly from P.
"
He aha te rerekētanga o te hanganga o te kanohi i waenganui i ngā rauropi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngā Whakaritenga o te Rauropi**.

The passage states ""...he rahi ngā momo kōiriiritanga o te karu, mō te taha ki te pīroiroi e hāngai ana ai ki ngā hiahia o te rauropi"" which translates to ""...there are many different kinds of eyes, tending toward specialized function as it pertains to organismal needs.""

The passage emphasizes that the variations in eye structure are linked to the needs of the organism. Therefore, option B is the most accurate reflection of the text. While the other options might be influenced by the needs of the organism, the most direct answer is the specific requirements themselves."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tehea korero mo te Sikhism kare i te whakaatu tika i te karakia?","The correct answer is **B: Ko te kaiako he āhuatanga taketake motuhake ki te Sikhism**.

Here's why:

*   The passage says ""ko te guru te tūāpapa o ngā Hāhi Inia katoa"" which translates to ""the guru is the foundation of all Indian Churches/Religions."" This directly contradicts statement B, which claims that the teacher is a specific fundamental feature of Sikhism.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: Ko te Sikhism te hua o te wehewehe ā iwi i roto i te tikanga Hindu (Sikhism is the result of an ethnic division within Hinduism)**: The passage states ""i ahu mai i... tētahi whakawehenga hāhi ki roto i te hāhi Hinitū (it originated from... a religious split within Hinduism)."" This aligns with option A. While ""ethnic division"" might be a strong way to phrase it, the underlying concept of a split from Hinduism is accurate according to the text.
*   **C: E iwa ngā kaiako i whai i te kaiwhakarewa o te whakapono, a Guru Nanak (Nine teachers followed the founder of the faith, Guru Nanak)**: The passage states ""E iwa ngā wānanga i whai i ana tapuwae (Nine academics followed in his footsteps)."" This accurately reflects the information provided.
*   **D: Kua ū ētahi tikanga o te Tīmatatanga ki te Hindu (Some traditions of the Beginning adhere to Hindu)**: The passage mentions that Sikhs acknowledge their Hindu roots and traditions. This aligns with the idea that some original customs were upheld with the start of this religion.

Therefore, option B is the only one that is directly contradicted by the provided text."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e whakaarotia ana he aronga uho o te pūnaha whakapono o Tīmata?","The correct answer is **A: Ko te ariā o te kaiako (The concept of the guru)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states ""Ko te guru te tūāpapa o ngā Hāhi Inia katoa, engari ki tā te Hāhi Sikh he whāinga nui kei reira i hua mai ai ngā mātāpono o te Sikh."" (The guru is the foundation of all Indian religions, but in the Sikh faith, it has a more significant purpose from which Sikh principles arise.) This directly identifies the guru as a central concept.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **B: Ngā tikanga Hindu (Hindu traditions):** While the passage acknowledges that Sikhism has roots in Hinduism, it also emphasizes that Sikhism is considered a separate religion and has its own distinct principles. Therefore, Hindu traditions are not the core focus.
*   **C: He whakakore ki te whakaae ki ētahi atu hāhi Īnia (A refusal to accept other Indian religions):** The passage doesn't mention rejecting other Indian religions. It only clarifies its separation from Hinduism.
*   **D: E kōrero ana i te reo Punjabi (Speaking the Punjabi language):** While Punjabi is associated with the region where Sikhism originated and the Gurmat is in Punjabi, the passage doesn't say it is a core tenet of their belief system."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea e uaua ai te arotahi o ngā tamariki e mate ana i te mate āta whakaaro?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **A: Mahi kura**

E ai ki te wāhanga, he uaua ki ngā tamariki e mate ana i te mate āta whakaaro (ADD) te aro ki ngā mahi kura, engari ka aro pū kē ki ngā mahi e pārekareka ana.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha ngā tamariki whai Pānga Whakamate, ka uru ki ngā whanonga mōrearea?","The correct answer is **D: Hei whakaoho i o rātau roro**.

The passage states that children with ADD engage in risky behavior, fighting, and defiance to ""whakahihiko i ō rātou roro, i te mea e kore ō rātou roro e hihiko i ngā mea o ia rā."" (stimulate their brains because their brains are not stimulated by everyday things). This directly translates to ""to stimulate their brains"".
"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i roto i te whārangi, ko tēhea o ēnei ehara i te tauira o te papa?","The passage describes scaffolding as support for individuals undertaking a new learning experience. It explicitly states that a teacher *is* a type of scaffold. The passage also mentions virtual scaffolds built into software that guide users through complex processes.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: He akoranga i te tīmatanga o tētahi kēmu rorohiko:** This aligns with the concept of virtual scaffolds providing guidance within a software program.
*   **B: He kaiako SAT:** This is a clear example of a teacher providing targeted support for a specific learning goal (SAT preparation). This aligns with the description in the passage that teachers are scaffolding.
*   **C: He hōtaka ako motuhake:** This can be a type of scaffold.
*   **D: He kaiako rōpū iti:** A small group instructor. A teacher is an example of a scaffold.

Therefore, the option that *doesn't* fit the description of a scaffold based on the passage is most likely **C: He hōtaka ako motuhake**. A special learning program is a broader concept and may not necessarily provide the targeted, responsive support that defines scaffolding.

**Final Answer: C**"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kōrero e kore e tino whakaahua i te ariā o te papa?,"The correct answer is **C: E mōhiotia ana hoki hei akoranga kaupapa i runga anō i te**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage clearly differentiates between scaffolding and project-based learning (ako pūtake kaupapa).** It states that while project-based learning might be easier and more engaging, scaffolding provides a different kind of support.
*   **A, B, and D are all supported by the passage:**
    *   **A: Ka taea te noho tūturu ki ngā papa (Scaffolds can be physical)** - The passage mentions both virtual and physical scaffolds (tīrewa ā-mariko, ā-kiko).
    *   **B: He nui ake te āwhina i te aratuka akoranga (More helpful than a course guide)** - The passage implies scaffolding provides specific, tailored support during the learning process, which is a more direct help than a general course guide.
    *   **D: Ka whakamahia ngā papa hei tautoko i te tīmatanga o tētahi wheako ako (Scaffolds are used to support the start of a learning experience)** - The passage explicitly says scaffolds provide support as individuals undertake new learning experiences, like using new software or starting a project.

Therefore, option C is the only one that misrepresents the concept of scaffolding as described in the passage."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ka whai painga pea te āhuahira MySpace ki ngā ākonga e raruraru ana ki te pānui?","The correct answer is **C: Tētahi wāhitau tukutuku**.

Here's why:

The passage states that it is easy to access MySpace because you can use ""tētahi whārangi paetukutuku e māma ai te maumahara me te patopato mā ngā ākonga he raru ōna ki te whakamahi i te papatuhi rorohiko, ki te tuhituhi hoki rānei.""  This means a simple website address could help students who struggle with typing or writing. Therefore, a simple website address is a potential benefit of MySpace for students with reading/writing difficulties.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: Ritenga:** While customization is mentioned, it's not directly linked to helping students with reading/writing difficulties access the site.
*   **B: Rangitaki:** Blogs are mentioned, but the passage doesn't say they specifically help students with reading/writing difficulties to access the site.
*   **D: 54 miriona ngā kōtaha:** This is just a statistic about the number of accounts and not related to accessibility for students with reading/writing problems."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei ehara i te wāhanga o te urupare a Krushchev ki nga whakararuraru a te kaimahi?","The correct answer is **C: Whakanuia ngā utu**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Whakatūria he pirimia hou (Appoint a new prime minister):** The passage explicitly states Krushchev agreed to install Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new prime minister.
*   **B: Whakamahia ngā reheke hei whakaora i te raupapa (Use tanks to restore order):** The passage mentions Krushchev sent in tanks to restore order.
*   **D: Kia mōhio ki ētahi whakaritenga ōhanga (Acknowledge some economic demands):** The passage says Krushchev conceded to some economic demands.
*   **C: Whakanuia ngā utu (Increase wages):** The passage indicates the workers were protesting *against* wage cuts (whakaheke utu). Therefore, Krushchev would not have *increased* wages as part of his response.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te take o nga tutu i Poland?,"The correct answer is **D: Te wāhuitanga o Wladyslaw Gomulka**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that shortages of food and wage cuts were causes of the protests.
*   The passage mentions the workers protested for the shortages of food and wage cut.
*   The passage mentions Wladyslaw Gomulka being appointed Prime Minister as a *result* of the unrest, not as a cause.

Therefore, the appointment of Wladyslaw Gomulka couldn't be the cause of the protests as it occurred afterward.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i pā ki te pānga i waenganui i te USSR me te Amerika?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā whakaaro mo Tiamana (Ideas about Germany)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions **Ngā rerekētanga ahurea (Cultural differences), Ngā tukanga pūrata (Differences in procedure) and Ngā tautohe e pā ana ki ngā pūnaha (Disputes about systems)** as factors that led to the tension between the USSR and the US after World War II.

*   While Germany was a common enemy during the war, the passage doesn't mention differing ideas about Germany as a direct cause of the Cold War tensions. The focus is on the ideological, procedural, and cultural clashes between the two superpowers."
Ko tehea o ēnei kōrero e kore e tino whakaahua i te take o te tuku i ngā pūkaha ki te tinana?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **A: Rere toto pōturi**.

Ko te take tēnei:

*   **P:** E whakamārama ana i te pūnaha ioio e pupuri ana i te taurite mā te tuku karere io kia rere tonu te toto me te ukiuki anō hoki. E kī ana hoki ka tere rawa te tuku karere kia noho haumaru ai te tinana i ngā whakatuma.
*   **Q:** E pātai ana mēnā ko tēhea kōrero i raro nei e kore e tino whakaahua i te take o te tuku i ngā pūkaha ki te tinana.
*   **A:** ""Rere toto pōturi"" - Kāore tēnei e tino whai pānga ana ki te take nui e whakahaere ana te pūnaha ioio i te rere toto. E hāngai ana te pūnaha ioio ki te **whakahaere**, kia **mau tonu**, kaua ki te **pōturi**.
*   **B:** ""Whakahaere ana i te rere toto"" - E hāngai ana tēnei ki te whakamārama i te ""P"".
*   **C:** ""Kei te pupuri i te mate kāinga"" - Ko te mate kāinga ko te pupuri i te taurite. E hāngai ana tēnei ki te whakamārama i te ""P"".
*   **D:** ""Kei te karo i ngā tuma ā-tinana"" - E hāngai ana tēnei ki te whakamārama i te ""P"" i te wā e tere ana te tuku karere io kia noho haumaru ai te tinana.

Nō reira, ko te whakautu tino tika ko A, nā te mea e whakaatu ana i te āhuatanga (rere toto pōturi) e **kore** e hāngai ana ki te mahi matua o te pūnaha ioio."
He aha ka kitea i Te Giza Plateau?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Ngā Urupa** and **D: Te Pyramid Nui**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Ngā Urupa** - The text states that the Giza Plateau, or ""Giza Necropolis"" in the Valley of the Dead, contains tombs (""ētahi toma""). ""Urupa"" translates to cemeteries or burial grounds, making this a fitting translation.
*   **D: Te Pyramid Nui** - The text explicitly mentions that the Great Pyramid is located on the Giza Plateau.
*   **B: Ngā ahumairangi** - The text does not mention any ahumairangi.
*   **C: Nga mea whakamiharo e whitu katoa** - The text states that the Great Pyramid is the *only* one of the Seven Wonders still standing. This means all seven wonders are *not* present on the Giza Plateau."
He aha te take o te Piramidi Nui?,"The passage states ""I hangaia te koeko mīharo hei whakanui i a Pharaoh Khufu...""

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Hei whakahonore i a Pharaoh**.
"
Ko wai te kawenga mo to tatou mōhiotanga mo te kaiwhakatuma i whakangaro i te temepara?,"The correct answer is **C: Strabo**.

The passage explicitly states that the Greek writer Strabo recorded the name of Herostratus, which is how we know it today.
"
He aha te kōrero tika e pā ana ki te hanga anō i te temepara o Aretemi?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **B: I hanga anōtia i muri i te rangatiratanga o Alexander te Nui**

Ko te take:

*   E ai ki te kōrero i roto i te P, i mate a Alexandra, nāwai rā, ka tū mai anō te temepara i te tau 323 BCE. No reira i hangaia anōtia i muri i tōna matenga, i te mutunga o tōna rangatiratanga.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i te wā tata tonu ka haere te momo i runga i nga waewae e rua?","The correct answer is **A: E whitu miriona tau ki mua**.

The passage states that ""he ahakoa i hīkoi pea te Sahelanthropus ki ngā waewae e rua e whitu miriona tau ki muri"". This indicates the earliest potential instance of bipedalism mentioned in the passage.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei momo e haere tonu ana i runga i ngā waewae e rua?,"The correct answer is **B: Homo Erectus**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Homo Erectus was the first known hominin to walk upright, starting about two million years ago. Since the passage does not say this species is extinct, we can presume that the species evolved into present day humans.
*   The passage mentions Sahelanthropus and Australopithecus but it mentions that these species are older than Homo Erectus and did not walk upright as much.
*   The term ""ngā whakawhāititanga ā-rua"" (bipedal adaptations) refers to a characteristic, not a specific species or group."
He aha te mea i ngana ai te ope moana Tiamana ki te whakatutuki i te Pakanga Tuarua o te Ao?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Te ārai i a Britain i te whiwhi tangata me ngā taonga**.

The passage states that the German navy tried to disrupt trade by using U-boats, which aimed to prevent Britain from receiving men and supplies.
"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i homai i roto i te wāhanga, ko wai i tino angitu ki te pakanga moana i te wā o te pakanga ki te Raki o Atalani?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **A: Ko ngā Ingarangi me ngā Amerikana**.

I roto i te kōrero, e kīia ana i ngana ngā Amerikana ki te whakaneke i ngā tāne me ngā rawa ki Peretānia, ā, i ngana te tauā-moana o Tiamani ki te whakatū i tērā. E whakaatu ana i te kore i angitu ngā Tiamana ki te aukati i ngā hoawhawhai, nā reira, ko ngā Amerikana me ngā Ingarangi i angitu.
"
He aha te mea i kore i te wā i whakatinanahia ai e ngā Āhiria te whakamahi i te kaieke hoiho?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā Saddles (Saddles)**

The passage states: ""Kāore anō te nohonga hōiho i hangaia, nō reira i pakanga te karawhiri Assyrian mā runga i te tuarā ake o ō rātou hōiho."" which translates to: ""The horse saddle had not yet been invented, so the Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare backs of their horses."" This directly indicates the lack of saddles.
"
Me pēhea te whawhai i ngā pakanga e whakamahi ana i te karaka?,"The passage states: ""Ko te karawhiri he tauā e pakanga ana mā runga hōiho."" This translates to ""The cavalry is an army fighting on horseback.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: I runga hoiho (On horseback)**
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, kaore koe e kite i tētahi tangata whenua o Babylonian wawaenga?","The correct answer is **D: Te kawe whakahere ki te wahi tapu o roto**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that only priests could enter the inner sanctuary (whakamaurutanga ki roto). Options A, B, and C all describe activities that would take place in the temple courtyard or during festivals, which would be accessible to the general public. Option D specifically describes an action within the inner sanctuary, which would be off-limits to the average Babylonian.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei i whakaritea mo nga tohunga?,"The correct answer is **B: whare tapu o roto**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""I ia temepara tētahi ātea temepara, ā, he whakamaurutanga ki roto ka taea anake e ngā pirihi te kuhu."" This directly says that the inner sanctuary (whare tapu o roto) was accessible only to the priests.
*   The other options are incorrect:
    *   Huihuinga (assemblies) are not mentioned as being exclusive to priests.
    *   Ngā Whakaaturanga (offerings) were brought by the people.
    *   Ziggurats were specific locations for the gods.
"
Nō whea i rongonui ai a Kingi Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **C: I muri i te kitenga o tona urupa** (After the discovery of his tomb).

The passage states, ""Heoi, nā tāna hura i tēnei toma i te tau 1922 i rongonui ai ia."" which translates to ""However, it was the discovery of his tomb in 1922 that made him famous.""
"
He aha i hanga ai a Kingi Tutankhamun hei kingi rongonui o Ihipa?,"The correct answer is **A: Ko te kitenga o tana urupa e kore nei e whakararuraru** (The discovery of his undisturbed tomb).

The passage explicitly states: ""Heoi, nā tāna hura i tēnei toma i te tau 1922 i rongonui ai ia. Inā kē he maha ngā toma o mua kua pāhuahuatia, i waiho noatia tēnei toma."" (However, it was the discovery of his tomb in 1922 that made him famous. Unlike many other tombs that had been looted, this tomb was untouched.)

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Ko tōna tūnga i runga i ngā rārangi kīngi tahito** (His position on the ancient king lists) - The passage says he *wasn't* considered important and wasn't on most king lists.
*   **C: Ko te tahae i ngā mano o ngā taonga tuku iho i tōna urupa** (The theft of thousands of artifacts from his tomb) - The passage says his tomb was *not* looted.
*   **D: tōna hiranga i ngā wā o Ihipa onamata** (His importance in ancient Egyptian times) - The passage states he wasn't considered very important in his own time."
He aha te mea kihai i taea e te kaituhi Kariki a Homer?,"The correct answer is **B: Tirohia (See)**.

The passage states that Homer was a ""kairotarota kāpō e kōrerotia ana"" meaning a blind poet. Therefore, he was unable to see.
"
Ko tehea Kariki rongonui e mōhiotia ana mō tētahi mea atu i te tuhinga?,"The correct answer is **C: Pythagorus**.

The passage mentions that Pythagoras is a Greek mathematician known for his famous theory about the relationships of the sides of right triangles. The other options are known for writing.
"
I hea te nuinga o te wā i noho ai te whānau Hiperu?,"The text states: ""Ko tā te oranga o te whānau Hīperu i waho kē."" This means the Hebrew family life was mostly outdoors. The text also mentions women cooking in the yard and men with open front shops facing the street.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **A: I te hau tuwhera (In the open air)**.
"
He aha te mea kihai i tino nui ki te whānau Hiperu?,"The correct answer is **C: to rātau kāinga** (their home).

The passage states that in the warm Middle Eastern climate, the home wasn't so important because family life centered outdoors.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i te whakaahuatia hei rerekētanga i waenganui i ngā whenua o Scandinavia?,"The passage explicitly states differences in ""ngā tāngata"" (people), ""ngā kīngi"" (kings - implying different political structures and histories), ""ngā tikanga"" (customs/traditions), and ""ngā hītori"" (histories).

The passage does NOT mention differences in the *physical land* itself (the whenua).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: Te whenua**
"
Ko wai i noho tuatahi ki Greenland?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā iwi Eskimo**.

The passage clearly states ""...i reira kē ngā iwi Eskimo e noho ana i taua wā."" which translates to ""the Eskimo people were already living there at that time.""
"
Ko tēhea rōpū e pai ake ana ki te kai me te kore he tūru?,"The correct answer is **C: Tangata Roma taonga**.

The passage states that wealthy men feasted together while reclining on their sides. This implies they were *not* using chairs.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei e kore e waiho hei wāhanga o te hakari o Roma o mua?,"The correct answer is **D: He whiri o Tāke tunu**.

The passage explicitly states that turkeys were not part of the ancient Roman diet because they originated in the Americas and were not introduced to Europe until centuries later. The other options are all mentioned in the passage as being part of Roman cuisine or customs."
"I runga anō i te whakawhitinga, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore e taea te pānga mau tonu?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: He ahurea iti.**

The passage states that smaller cultures are often absorbed and their traditions lost, preventing a group from becoming a powerful, enduring civilization. The other options are linked to larger structures."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha i mua i te iwi?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: He nga ahurea iti**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Ka maninohea noa ngā ahurea iti nei, ka ngaro ngā kōrero tuku iho e mana ai te iwi hei iwi mananui."" This translates to: ""These smaller cultures are often overshadowed, and the traditions that allow a people to be a great people are lost."" This implies that smaller cultures (""nga ahurea iti"") existed *before* the larger ""iwitanga"" (civilization) emerged. They are essentially the building blocks or precursors to the civilization."
Ko tēhea kōrero mo te Drukgyal Dzong ehara i te pono?,"The correct answer is **A: I hangaia hei whakanui i te wikitoria o ngā ope o Tibetan-Mongol.**

The passage states that Drukgyal Dzong was built by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel to commemorate his victory *against* the Tibetan-Mongol forces, not *in honor* of them. The other options are all true based on the provided text.
"
Ko tēhea kōrero e tino whakaahua ana i te putanga o te ahi i te Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **A: Ko te mea anake i toe ko te whakapakoko o Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal** (The only thing left was the statue of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal).

The passage explicitly states that in 1951, after the great fire at Drukgyal Dzong, only some artifacts remained, including the image of Zhabdrung. The other options are incorrect based on the information in the passage.
"
Ko tehea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki Cambodia?,"The correct answer is **D: I whakangaromia e nga Tai a Phnom Phen**.

The passage states: ""I eke ngā Thais i Kamapōtia i ētahi wā i te rautau 18, ā, i te tau 1772 i whakahotu rātou i Phnom Phen."" (The Thais invaded Cambodia at times in the 18th century, and in 1772 they *sacked* Phnom Penh.) The word ""whakahotu"" implies a destructive invasion, synonymous with sacking, not just a regular occupation.
"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e tino whakaahua ana i ngā whakaekenga o Cambodia?,"The best answer is **D: He maha ngā wā i whakaekehia ai e ngā Thai a Cambodia** (The Thais invaded Cambodia many times).

Here's why:

*   **P** explicitly states ""I eke ngā Thais i Kamapōtia i ētahi wā i te rautau 18"" (The Thais invaded Cambodia at various times in the 18th century), which directly supports this answer.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as good:

*   **A: He maha ngā wā i whakaekehia ai a Cambodia e ngā Vietnamese** (Cambodia was invaded many times by the Vietnamese): While Vietnamese incursions are mentioned, the passage emphasizes the frequency of Thai invasions more strongly.
*   **B: I whakaekehia e nga Thai me nga Vietnamese a Cambodia i te 1772** (The Thai and Vietnamese invaded Cambodia in 1772): The text only states that the Thais invaded Phnom Phen in 1772, not both countries invading in the same year.
*   **C: I whakangaromia e te Vietnam a Phnom Phen** (Vietnam destroyed Phnom Phen): The passage says the Thais *sacked* Phnom Phen (whakahotu) but doesn't say Vietnam destroyed it. ""Whakahotu"" does not translate to destroyed, rather to sack."
Ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i mahia e te Kamupene o Īnia ki te Rāwhiti o Hōnea i roto i to rātau wā i Taiwana?,"The correct answer is **D: E pai ana ki te tuku i te mana o Taiwan ki te rangatiratanga o Qing**.

Here's why:

*   **A: He turanga ki te taha tonga-uru o te motu:** The passage states ""I te tau 1624,i te whakatū te Dutch East India Company i tētahi wāhi kāinga ki Taiwana ki te tonga mā uru...""

*   **B: Whakamahia te whakaputa witi taketake:** The passage states ""nā reira i tīmata ai tētahi hurihanga ki ngā tikanga whakaputa tōpata a ngā iwi taketake...""

*   **C: Whakamahia ngā kaimahi Hainamana ki ōna marawhenua:** The passage states ""...me te utu i ngā kaimahi Hainamana ki te mahi ki āna tupuranga raihi me te huka.""

*   **D: E pai ana ki te tuku i te mana o Taiwan ki te rangatiratanga o Qing:** The passage states that the Qing Dynasty took control in 1683, but there is no indication that the Dutch East India Company *willingly* ceded control. They were overtaken.
"
He aha te whakataunga o te Tiriti o Shimonoseki?,"The correct answer is **D: Te mana o Tiapanī i Taiwana** (The rule of Japan in Taiwan).

The passage states that the Treaty of Shimonoseki, signed after China's defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War, ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, making Japan the governing power until 1945.
"
He pēhea te taumata pH o te ine matū?,"The correct answer is **C: Te nui o ngā ions Hydrogen i roto i te matū** (The amount of Hydrogen ions in the substance).

The passage explicitly states: ""Ka tūtohu te taumata o te pH mā te nui o te katote Hauwai (te H o te pH) o roto i te matū kua mātaitia.""  This directly translates to ""The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (the H of pH) within the substance being measured.""
"
He aha i tangohia mai i ngā ions Hydrogen?,"The correct answer is **A: Protons**.

The passage states: ""Ko ngā katote hauwai i turaki iraoho me ngā irahiko (mai i te ngota hauwai kotahi te iraoho me te irahiko."" This translates to ""Hydrogen ions have lost their protons and electrons (from a hydrogen atom that has one proton and one electron)."" Therefore, what's left after losing the electron is a proton.
"
Ko tehea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e kore e tika te whakaahua i te hui o nga raiona?,"The correct answer is **C: He whanaunga tata ngā tāne me ngā wāhine**.

Here's why:

*   **P** states: ""Ki roto i tētahi paraite i waenganui i te kotahi ki te toru ngā taurawhi pakeke he whanaunga rātou, tahi ki te tae atu ki te toru tekau uwha me ngā punua."" (In a pride there are between one to three adult males that are related to each other, along with up to thirty females and cubs). This confirms that the males are related. However it continues with ""He pānga kiritahi te nuinga o ngā wāhine tētahi ki tētahi i te nuinga o te wā, nā te mea he whānau nui o ngā tuakana/teina me ngā tamāhine."" (The females are generally related to each other as a large family of sisters/brothers and daughters.) This only indicates that the females are related to each other.

*   **A** is correct, according to the last sentence in **P** ""Ka āhua pērā te mahi a ngā rōpū raiona i ngā rōpū wuruhi, kurī rānei..."" (Lion groups behave similarly to wolf or dog packs).

*   **B** is correct, as the information provided indicates there are far more females than males in a pride.

*   **D** is correct, as the passage states that lions are deadly predators, and live in groups.

Therefore, the statement that does NOT accurately describe a lion pride is that the males and females are closely related."
Ko tehea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e kore e tika te whakaahua i te whanonga o nga raiona?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **D: He ōrite tō rātou whanonga ki ētahi atu ngeru nui**.

I roto i te kōrero, e kīia ana he rite te whanonga o ngā raiona ki ngā wuruhi, ehara i ētahi atu ngeru nui.
"
He kai noa iho ngā rākau mō te aha te momo kaiwhaiwhai?,"The passage P discusses different sized cats eating animals of different sizes. It mentions medium-sized cats eating animals from rabbits to antelopes to deer. It also mentions smaller cats eating things like insects, shrews, lizards, and birds.

The question Q asks what type of prey eats plants only. The passage P does not discuss prey that eats plants. The correct answer option would be D, antelopes, since the passage mentions that some medium sized cats eat antelopes.
Given the available information, the question does not provide the correct context, so the best answer is likely D.

Therefore, the best answer is **D: Antelopes**.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e tino whaia ana e ngā ngeru iti?,"Based on the provided text:

*   The text states that medium-sized cats eat animals ranging in size from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
*   It also states that small cats (including domestic cats) eat small things like rodents, possums, lizards and birds.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Ngā Rodents** (Rodents)
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te wāhanga o te tikanga hopu a te ocelot?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **B: E whai ana i te kakara o a rātau manu**.

He whakamārama:

*   **A: E whakamāramatia ana i roto i to rātau taiao:** E kī ana te kōrero i te āta nekeneke o te ocelot, me te whakaranu me ōna taiao.
*   **C: I muri i a rātau taonga parakete i te pō:** E kī ana te kōrero he rawe ō rātou karu ki te titiro i roto i te pō uriuri me ngā tirohanga o te pō.
*   **D: E pā ana anake ki ngā kararehe o te rahi iti iho:** E kī ana te kōrero ko te nuinga o ngā kararehe e aru nei ngā ocelot he iti rawa iho i a ia.
*   **B: E whai ana i te kakara o a rātau manu:** E kī ana te kōrero e whakaaro ana ngā kaimātai pūtaiao mā te hongi e rapu ai te ocelot i āna kai, e whai ai ia ki hea rā i te whenua ōna kai e haere ana. Kāore i te kī e whai ana rātou i te kakara o a rātau manu."
Ko tehea o ēnei kōrero e kore e tika te whakaahua i te ocelot? ,"The correct answer is **C: He ngoikore to rātau mana kakara**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that scientists believe ocelots use their sense of smell to find and track prey. This implies that their sense of smell is *strong*, not weak.
*   The passage mentions that ocelots have good night vision, move carefully, and hunt smaller animals, so options A, B, and D are all true."
Ko tēhea o ēnei e kore e kiia ko te kaha nui o te taikaha?,"The correct answer is **A: Haruru**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that tigers are known for being able to climb, jump far, and pull five times their own weight.
*   The passage also explicitly states that, while they can roar, their roar is more like a low rumble. Therefore, the roar is not a defining strength."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o nga rerekētanga i waenganui i nga tākaro me nga raiona?","The correct answer is **B: Te tangi o to rātau haruru**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Ko te haruru a te taika ehara i te mea he haruru nui pērā ki te raiona, engari he momo ngengere, he momo tīwahawaha"" - ""The tiger's roar isn't a loud roar like a lion's, but a type of growl, a type of murmur."" This directly contrasts the sound of the tiger's roar with that of a lion.

The other options are not explicitly stated as differences between tigers and lions in the provided passage. The passage states that tigers can kaukau (swim). The passage does not mention the peke (jump) of lions. The passage does not mention how many times stronger the lions are in their kukume (pull)."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mahi a Robert Hooke i mua i ētahi atu kaimātai koiora?","The correct answer is **A: Tirohia ngā pūtau mate**

The passage states: ""Ko ia te tangata tuatahi ki te kite i ngā pūtau mate"" which translates to ""He was the first person to see dead cells.""
"
"""He aha te take o te kupu """"pūtau"""" te tikanga?""","The correct answer is **B: Rūma iti**.

The passage states: ""Kua ahu mai te kupu pūtau i te kupu cella nō te reo Rātini ko tōna tikanga ko te rūma paku."" This directly translates to ""The word cell comes from the Latin word cella which means small room.""
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko te nuinga o nga kararehe e āhei ana ki te mahi i te aha?","The correct answer is **B: Nuku**.

The passage states ""Ka taea e te nuinga o ngā kararehe te nuku,"" which translates to ""Most animals can move."" While the passage also mentions animals digging, swimming, and flying, it's the ability to move that is presented as a common characteristic of most animals.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha ētahi kararehe kāore i a ia?","The correct answer is **C: Roro**.

The passage states: ""Kei ngā kararehe anake he roro (ahakoa kāore i te katoa o ngā kararehe; hei tauira, kāore he roro tō ngā pūkarukaru)."" This clearly indicates that some animals do not have brains.
"
He aha ngā tipu e āwhina ana i te tukanga whakaahua?,"The correct answer is **D: Rā (Sun)**.

The passage states: ""Kei te hangaia e ngā tipu ā rātou ake kai mai i te **rā** ki te ahotakakame"" which translates to ""Plants make their own food from the **sun** through photosynthesis.""

Therefore, the sun is the element mentioned in the passage that aids the process of photosynthesis.
"
He aha te āhua o te tangata e tipu ana i te tāpu?,"Based on the provided information (P), the correct answer is **B: Hāora (Oxygen)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states ""Ka hangaia e te tipu te hāora ka hāngia e te tangata"" - meaning ""The plant produces oxygen that humans breathe""."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā tauira e whai ake nei e aukati i te tukanga kunenga?","E ai ki te kōrero, ko te tukanga kunenga ka pā mai ina wehe ana tētahi **rōpū iti** i tētahi **rahinga nui** ka neke ki tētahi taiao hou. Ka urutau taua rōpū iti ki tērā taiao rerekē, ā, i te roanga o te wā, ka tino rerekē rātou i te rahinga nui i ahu mai ai rātou.

Nō reira, ko te whakautu tika ko:

**A: I rahua te tipu o tētahi rōpū iti ki tētahi tauwāhi hōu**

Mēnā kāore te rōpū iti i te tipu, kāore rātou e urutau ki te taiao hou, ā, kāore hoki te kunenga e whai wāhi. Ko ngā kōwhiringa B, C, me D e whakaatu ana i ngā āhuatanga e taea ai e te kunenga te pā.
"
Ko tehea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e kore e tino whakaahua i te tukanga o te whakatū? ,"The correct answer is **A: Ka puta ina kore e taea e tētahi iwi hou te urutau**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes the founder effect (which is a component of speciation) as happening *because* the new population adapts to its new environment. If they *failed* to adapt, they would likely go extinct, not evolve into a new species. The other options all accurately reflect aspects of the process as described in the passage.
"
Ko tēhea wāhanga o te pūnaha whakaheke toto e kawe i te toto ki te ngakau?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngā Pūmatua**.

The passage states: ""...ka hoki mai ki te manawa ki ngā pū e kīia ana he ia-auraki.""  ""Ia-auraki"" is the same as ""Pūmatua"" therefore the correct answer is B.
"
Ko tēhea ngā ngongo iti rawa i roto i te pūnaha whakaheke toto?,"The correct answer is **C: iaia**.

The passage states: ""Ko ngā pū iti rawa e kīia ana he ngongo rauangi.""  ""Ngongo rauangi"" translates to capillaries. ""iaia"" is the closest translation in this case.
"
Ko te āheinga o te ngārara ki te takahi i ōna parirau ki muri e whakanui ana i tēhea o ēnei?,"Based on the passage, the ability to fold wings allows insects to hide in smaller spaces. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: Huna i nga waahi (Hiding in spaces)**
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e kore e whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga hei mea e pā ana ki te kaha rere o te ngārara?,"The correct answer is **B: Roanga o te ora** (Lifespan).

Here's why:

*   **A: whakaputa (Reproduction):** The passage mentions finding a mate as a benefit of flight.
*   **C: huihuinga kai (Gathering food):** The passage mentions finding food as a benefit of flight.
*   **D: Maina kaikā (Avoiding Predators):** The passage mentions avoiding enemies as a benefit of flight.

The passage does not discuss the lifespan of insects. Therefore, lifespan is not mentioned as something related to the flight capabilities of insects."
Ko tēhea o ngā āhuatanga e whai ake nei kāore i te pāhono nuitia ki ngā dinosaur?,"The correct answer is **B: Huruhuru (Feathers)**.

Here's why:

*   **P (Passage):** The passage states that many people don't believe dinosaurs could have feathers, implying that feathers are not commonly associated with dinosaurs in the public perception. It then goes on to list dinosaur characteristics that *are* similar to birds: scaly feet, claws, laying eggs, and walking on two legs like a T-Rex.

*   **Q (Question):** The question asks which trait is *not* typically associated with dinosaurs.

Therefore, feathers are the trait that is *not* commonly connected with dinosaurs, even though the passage indicates that many paleontologists now believe dinosaurs evolved into birds.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i te whakaarotia noatia hei āhuatanga tiritiri o ngā manu me ngā dinosaur?,"The correct answer is **C: Te kaha ki te rere (The ability to fly)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions that many people don't believe dinosaurs could be related to birds because they have feathers and can fly. This implies that flight is a key differentiating factor in people's minds.
*   The passage lists other similarities: scaled feet and claws, laying eggs, and walking on two hind legs.
*   Options A, B and D are characteristics shared by both dinosaurs and birds.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea wāhanga o te tipu cycad tērā pea ka kai tētahi Triceratops?","The correct answer is **A: Ka rau te spiky**.

The passage states: ""Kua taea e te Triceratops te whakamahi i tana ngutu kaha kia mahura i ngā rau i mua i te kāinga o te tīwai."" This translates to ""The Triceratops could use its strong beak to strip the leaves before eating them.""

Therefore, the passage specifically mentions that Triceratops ate the leaves of the cycad. While the passage discusses whether they ate the fruit, it explicitly says they stripped and ate the leaves.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei ka tino kai te Triceratops? ","The correct answer is **B: He tipu me ngā manga pakeke (A plant with tough branches)** and **D: He tipu me ngā hua paitini (A plant with poisonous fruit)**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states ""Ko te niho o te Triceratop kua taea te kuru i ngā rau me ngā peka rākau tīno kaha, me ngā akaaka anō hoki"" which translates to ""The Triceratops' teeth were able to crush tough leaves and branches, as well as roots."" So this confirms that they ate **plants with tough branches**.
*   The passage suggests that Triceratops may have eaten Cycads, which may contain toxins.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   A: He kāniwha (Canines) - Not mentioned in the passage.
*   C: Kākā (Parrot) - Parrots are mentioned as modern animals that can eat poisonous leaves/fruits, but the question asks what the Triceratops ate."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā hākinakina e whai ake nei e tino manakohia ana i ngā rohe ki te raki o Itari?","The correct answer is **C: Papa Huka (Hoki Tio)**.

The passage states: ""He rorotu rawa ngā hākinakina hōtoke ki ngā takiwā Raki"" (Winter sports are very popular in the northern regions). Hoki tio (Ice Hockey) is a winter sport. The other options are not explicitly mentioned as being popular in the northern regions.
"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i homai i roto i te wāhanga, ko tēhea o ngā hākinakina e whai ake nei i toa i tētahi whakataetae ao mō Itari?","The passage states that the Italian national football team won the FIFA World Cup in 2006. Football is mentioned in the passage using the te reo Māori word, ""whutupōro"". Therefore, the correct answer is:

A: Whutupōro
"
I muri i te aha i riro ai ētahi wāhanga o Luxembourg hei wāhanga o Peeke?,"The correct answer is **B: Ko te Huringa o Belgian (The Belgian Revolution)**.

The passage states: ""Ko ētahi wāhi o nāianei o Belgium he wāhanga o mua o Luxembourg ēngari i Belgianngia whai muri i ngā tau 1830 o te hurihanga nui a Belgian."" This directly translates to ""Some present-day areas of Belgium were formerly part of Luxembourg but became Belgian following the 1830s of the great Belgian revolution.""
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei āhuatanga e pā ana ki te tōrangapū o Luxembourg?,"The correct answer is **B: Hono ana ki te Uniana o Ūropi**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Luxembourg became a founding member of what is now the European Union. The other options are either past events or issues which are not still affecting the country directly.
"
E hia ngā kiromita tapawha o te rohe katoa o Turkey kei Uropi?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**

The passage states: ""...kei Ūropi te 23,764 kiromita pūrua (9,174 maero pūrua).""
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, e hia ngā māwhiti te roa o Tāke?","The correct answer is **D: 1000**.

The passage states: ""Ko te rohe o Tākei he nui ake i te 1,600 kiromita (1,000 māero) te roa..."" which translates to ""The length of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles)...""
"
He aha te reo Rātini e whakamahia ana i Vatican City?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **A: Ngā tikanga whakapono**

E ai ki te kōrero, ""kei te tino whakamahia te reo Rātini ki ngā kawa ā-hāhi."" Ko ""ngā kawa ā-hāhi"" te tikanga ""ngā tikanga whakapono"".
"
"I roto i te Vatican City, he aha te kore e whakamahia ai te reo Itari?","The correct answer is **C: Ngā tikanga whakapono**.

The passage states that Latin is used for church services (kawa ā-hāhi), which falls under religious practices. Italian is used for official communications (pārongorongo) and daily interactions, and is the language of law (ture).
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā painga e whai ake nei mai i te whāranu oro i runga i ngā rorohiko mātauranga?","The passage states: ""He nui ngā wā ka rīkoatatia te puoro mā ngā rorohiko mātanga hei whakarite, hei whenumi tahi hoki i ngā oro."" This directly refers to music.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Puoro**.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko te nuinga o nga kāinga i whakaaturia ai e te tauwāhi nga whare taonga e hīrere ana?","Based on the text, the answer is **A: Mohenjo-daro**.

The text states: ""Kei ngā tāone nui o Harappa, o Mohenjo-daro hoki tētahi wharepaku wai ki te tata ki ngā whare katoa..."" (In the major cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, there was a water closet in almost every house...). This indicates that a high percentage of homes in Mohenjo-daro had these facilities. While the other locations (Persia, China, Santorini) are mentioned as having ancient bathrooms, the text does not specify that they were present in almost every home.
"
I whea o ngā wāhi e whai ake nei i kitea ai ngā pūnaha waipiro matatau?,"Based on the provided passage, the correct answer is **B: Santorini**.

The passage mentions that the remains of sewage systems were found in the Minoan towns of Crete and Santorini in Greece. While Harappa, Egypt, and China are mentioned as having ancient toilets, only Crete and Santorini are explicitly stated to have remains of sewage systems.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e ārahi ana i te Skater kia huri?,"The best answer is **A: Ko te ānau iti i te raro o te papa o te Skate (The slight curve on the bottom of the skate blade)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Nā te mea kei te āhua ānau te taha whakararo o te mata, ka tītaha te mata ki tētahi taha, ki tērā atu taha rānei, ka ānau hoki te taha e pā ana ki te tio. Mā konā te kaireti e tahuri."" This translates to ""Because the bottom edge of the blade is slightly curved, when the blade is tilted to one side or the other, the edge that contacts the ice also curves. This is how the skater turns.""

Let's look at why the other options are not as good:

*   **B: Ko ngā pito e rua i te taha o te papa o te Skate (The two edges on the side of the skate blade)** While the edges do help with grip, the curve is what facilitates the turning motion. The passage mentions the edges' function for grip, but highlights the curve as the turning mechanism.
*   **C: Ko te taumata āheinga whānui o te Skater (The general ability level of the Skater)** Skater skill is important for control, but the *reason* they can turn is due to the skate design.
*   **D: Te kounga o te hukapapa (The quality of the ice)** Ice quality affects grip and speed, but it doesn't *cause* the turning action. The curve of the blade allows for turning regardless of whether the ice is perfect.

Therefore, option A most directly answers the question based on the provided text."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e whakamārama ana i te hāngai i runga i te rau o tētahi hukapapa o nāianei?","Based on the passage, the best answer is **A: Mata-taurua**.

Here's why:

*   The passage directly states: ""Kei te mata o tētahi reti tio hou tētahi **matarua** me te pūaha kōpapa ki waenganui."" (The surface of a new ice skate has a **dual edge** with a shallow groove in the middle.)
*   Ānau (curved): While the curved edge *contributes* to turning, it's the dual edge that is the fundamental feature.
* Concave (pūaha kōpapa): This is one particular aspect of the new ice skate design.
*   Tilted (tītaha): Tilting is an *action* the skater takes, not a feature *of* the skate's blade.

Therefore, ""mata-taurua"" (dual-edge) is the most accurate description of a feature present on a modern ice skate blade, according to the provided passage."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, He aha te tukanga e āhei ai ngā ngota ki te whakakore i te pūngao o te marama?","The correct answer is **B: Whakaongaonga te tukunga o nga whakaahua**

Here's why:

*   The passage directly states: ""Ka karangatia tēnei mahinga e ngā kaipūtaiao te """"stimulated emission of radiation"""" i te mea e hikohikongia ana ngā ngota e ngā raiti muramura, e puha ai te pūaho o te raiti"" (Scientists call this process ""stimulated emission of radiation"" because atoms are stimulated by flashes of light, causing the light to emit.)
*   ""Whakaongaonga te tukunga o nga whakaahua"" translates to ""Stimulated emission of radiation.""
*   The passage explains that atoms can return to a lower energy state by emitting a ""pūaho"" (photon) of light, which is the principle behind stimulated emission."
He aha te take o te ngota hai whakaputa whakaahua?,"The correct answer is **B: Ko te whakaongaonga i puta mai i te marama kaha (The stimulation from intense light)**.

The passage explains that atoms emit photons (pūaho) to return to a lower energy level after being stimulated by light (raiti muramura). This process is even named ""stimulated emission of radiation"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te tuku pūngao nui (Releasing a lot of energy):** While energy is released, the *reason* for the photon emission is the stimulation by light, not simply the release of energy.
*   **C: Ngā taumata pūngao hauā (Different energy levels):** While different energy levels are *necessary* for this process, they are not the *cause* of the atom producing a photon. It is the atom trying to return to its base form.
*   **D: He urupare kino ki te hihi (A negative reaction to the radiation):** There is no mention of a ""negative reaction"", rather stimulation by light to produce something beneficial.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te take o te pūrama mārama kia mutu te mahi?","The correct answer is **C: E tahuna ana te kaka i roto i te pūrama** (The filament inside the light bulb burns out).

The passage states ""Whai muri i ngā tini hāora o te mahi, ka pakarū te kaka o te rama, ā, ka kore anō te rama e mahi."" which translates to ""After many hours of work, the filament of the light bulb breaks, and the light bulb no longer works."" This directly indicates the filament burning out is the reason the bulb stops working.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e taea te mōrearea ki te pa ki te whakakapi i tētahi pōtae?,"The correct answer is **C: Te pūtake o te pūrama** (The base of the bulb).

The passage explains that touching the metal part of the fixture or the metal base of the bulb while it's even slightly in the socket can cause an electric shock. This is because electricity is flowing to the area where the metal parts of the fixture reside. The other options are less directly related to the danger described in the passage.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea ka wehea te karihi?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: Kua tukua te pūngao (Kua tukuna te ngoi)**.

The passage states: ""E whakawehe nei anō i te poka pū, ka tukuna ai ētahi o taua ngoi.""  This translates to ""It also splits the nucleus, releasing some of that energy."" This directly indicates that energy is released when the nucleus is split.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whakaatu ana i ngā waea tawhiti ki te Ao,"The correct answer is **D: Pūroro** (Satellites).

The passage explicitly states that satellites are used to make calls over long distances.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whakamahia ana hei tuku i tētahi pouaka whakaata ki te mokowā?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngā aorangi neke atu i te 100 waewae te teitei** (Rockets taller than 100 feet).

The passage states: ""Mā te rākete rahi nui ake i te 100 putu te teitei e tuku i tētahi āmiorangi, karu whātata ranei ki tuarangi."" This translates to: ""A rocket larger than 100 feet in height will send a satellite or telescope into space.""  Since satellites are used for television transmission, rockets are used to launch them.
"
He aha te mea me mōhio e pā ana ki tētahi kaupapa hurihuri hei whai i te haere o te wā?,"The correct answer is **A: Roanga**.

The passage states: ""Mā te wā hoki e whakataurite ai tātou i te **roanga** o ngā mahinga."" It then says you can see the passage of time by observing a periodic event. Therefore, to track time using a periodic event, you need to know its **duration** (roanga).
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te āhua o tētahi takahanga e whakamahia ana hei whakataurite?","The correct answer is **B: Tāruatanga (Repetition)**.

The passage states: ""E taea e koe te kite ake i te hipanga o te wā mā te āta titiro ki te tōaitanga o tetahi mahi hurihuri. Ko tētahi mahi hurihuri ko tētahi mahi he auau te puta mai anō."" This translates to: ""You can observe the passing of time by looking closely at the repetition of a cyclical event. A cyclical event is an event that occurs regularly.""

Therefore, the passage indicates that a repeating/cyclical event (tāruatanga) is used for comparison.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tehea o ēnei e kiia ana he tauira mō tētahi kaiwhiwhi o te torona?","The correct answer is **D: Haere ana ki te whare wānanga i mua i te hononga ki te hōia**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that traditionally, those of ""toto kikorangi"" (blue blood, implying royalty or nobility) went directly to military academy after school.
*   Tiare (Charles) broke this tradition by going to university *before* joining the military.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kei te whiwhi i tētahi waeine 2:2** - The passage specifically mentions Charles *receiving* a 2:2, not that it's a common trait of all ""toto kikorangi"".
*   **B: Ka whakarerea te whare wananga ki te uru atu ki te hoia** - The passage states that traditionally ""toto kikorangi"" would go straight into military academy. Charles broke that tradition and went to university first.
*   **C: Hītori Ako** - The passage states that Charles studied Anthropology and Archaeology, then History, to get his 2:2. There is no context to suggest that other members of the ""toto kikorangi"" also study this."
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i hoatu i roto i te wāhanga, ko Charles te tuatahi ki te mahi i te aha?","Based on the information provided, the correct answer is **C: Whiwhi Waeine**.

The passage states that Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to be awarded a university degree.
"
Nō tēhea whenua te kaipuke a Trygvasson?,"The correct answer is **D: Nōwei**.

The passage states ""Nā Olaf Trygvasson tēnei kāhui i ārahi, he uri nō Nōwini e hiahi ana ki te whakahoki mai i te mana o tōna whenua..."".  This translates to ""Olaf Trygvasson led this group, a descendant of Norway who wanted to restore the power of his country..."".
"
He aha te wā i roto i te hītori i whakamahia ai e Tiamana he āhuatanga ahurea kaha ki Estonia?,"The passage states that Estonia was under German influence in the 15th century. To figure out how many years ago that was, we need to know what year it is currently. Since this is an AI, I don't know the current date. However, even if it was the year 2024, the 15th century was about 600 years ago. 

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: Neke atu i te 600 tau ki mua**
"
He aha te take i puta ai te reo Estonian?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngā māngai Tiamana**.

The passage states that ""ētahi monaki Tiamani"" (some German monks) wanted to make God more accessible to the native people, so they created a written form of Estonian. ""Ngā māngai Tiamana"" refers to these German representatives.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko te maha o ngā tukuoro Hīni māori e tārere ana i runga anō i tēhea āhuatanga?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **A: Mēnā e whakahaeretia ana ngā reo rite rawa ki te reo Hindi**.

Ko te take: E ai ki te kōrero, ""E rerekē ana te tau o ngā kaikōrero ūkaipō i runga i te tatau, kāore rānei i ngā mita tino tata te hononga."" Ko te tikanga, mena ka tatau nga reo tata ki te Hindi, ka nui ake te tokomaha o nga kaikōrero e kiia ana he kaikorero Hindi.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kōrero e tika ana mō te reo Hindi me te reo Urdu?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: He rerekē rātou ki te hōtuhi (They are different in writing)**.

The passage states: ""He rite te Hindi me te Urdu ki te taha wete reo heoi he rerekē te taha tuhinga; (Hindi and Urdu are similar in grammar, however, they are different in writing)"".
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kōrero e kore e tika mō te reta Hangeul?,"The correct answer is **A: I hangaia i te tīmatanga o te rangatiratanga o Kingi Sejong**.

Here's why:

*   **P states:** ""I hangaia mai te ororeta i te tau 1444 i te wā o te heipūtanga a Kīngi Sejong (1418-1450)."" This means Hangeul was created later in his reign, not at the beginning.

The other options are all correct:

*   **B:** P states: ""I tapa tūturu ia i te arapū Hanguel ki Hunmin Jeongeum...""
*   **C:** P states: ""Ko King Sejong te kīngi tuawhā o te Joseon Dynasty...""
*   **D:** While not explicitly stated, the phrase """"ngā oro tika mō te whakaako i te tangata"""" implies it was created with a specific purpose."
I te mutunga ka hurihia te reta Hunmin Jeongeum ki te aha?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

The passage states: ""I tapa tūturu ia i te arapū Hanguel ki Hunmin Jeongeum..."". This means that the Hanguel alphabet was originally called Hunmin Jeongeum, and at some point later this was changed.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko ēhea ngā reo i whakaawetia e Sanskrit?","The correct answer is **D: Ngā reo Īnia**

The passage states: ""ā, ko ia hoki te reo taketake o ngā tini reo Īniana o nāianei"" which translates to ""and it is also the root language of many modern Indian languages"". This clearly indicates that Sanskrit influenced Indian languages.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i whakahekea te whakamahinga o te Sanskrit nā te aha?","The correct answer is **D: Aroākapa**.

The passage states: ""Whai muri mai i te whakahiatotanga o Upanishards, e memeha noa iho a Sanskrit i ngā mahi nahanaha."" This translates to: ""After the compilation of the Upanishads, Sanskrit gradually faded in systematic practices."" ""Aroākapa"" is the best translation for ""systematic practices"" in this context.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he tauākī tika e pā ana ki te tō ā-papa i Io?","The correct answer is **D: Ka kaha ake te kaha o te whenua ki a koe i te kaha o Io**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that you would weigh less on Io than on Earth. Weight is a measure of the force of gravity pulling on you. Since you weigh less on Io, Io's gravitational pull is weaker than Earth's. Thus, Earth's gravitational force is stronger.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ka iti ake te kaha o te whenua ki a koe i te kaha o Io** This is incorrect because the passage states you will be lighter on Io, thus Io has less strength.

*   **B: Ka nui ake te kukume a te taumaha o te mea, koia koe ka iti ake ai te** This is incorrect because it is not explained what the weight of the item has to do with this.

*   **C: He nui ake te kume o te tō ā-papa o Io, koia koe ka nui ake tō pauna** This is incorrect because the passage states that you will be lighter on Io.

"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā tauākī e whai ake nei e whakamārama tika ana i te apa whakawaho o te Marama?","The correct answer is **C: Tērā pea he iti ake ngā maria i te taha tua atu**.

Here's why:

*   **P states:** ""...he 100 km te mātotoru ki te taha tawhiti. Ko raro i te maria he tūpuhi, ki tuawhenua he whānui ake. Ka nui ake pea te maria ki te taha tata i te mea he kōrahirahi ake te kirinuku."" - This means that the far side of the moon has a thicker crust, and the near side has thinner crust. Therefore, it is likely there are fewer maria on the far side as the crust is thicker.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: He matotoru ake te kiri o te taha tata** - Incorrect. The passage states the *opposite* is true.
*   **B: He māmā ake te kiri i raro i ngā whenua teitei** - Incorrect. The passage states that the crust is thinner under maria.
*   **D: Tērā pea he iti iho ngā maria i raro i ngā whenua teitei** - Incorrect. The passage states that the crust is thinner under maria."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, kei hea te kirinuku o te Marama te mātotoru rawa?","Based on the passage, the answer is **C: I raro i nga Whenua Tiketike (Under the highlands)**.

The passage states: ""Ko raro i te maria he tūpuhi, ki tuawhenua he whānui ake."" This translates to ""Under the maria it is thin, but in the highlands it is wider."" Since ""whānui ake"" means wider or thicker, the crust is thickest under the highlands.
"
"I runga anō i te whakawhitinga, ko tēhea o ēnei e whakaponotia ana e ētahi tāngata?","The correct answer is **C: Kei ētahi atu aorangi te ora**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""ka whai whakaarohia e ētahi tāngata he aha kei waho rā kei te whakapono ētahi he tautangata, he koiora anō kei te noho pea kei tētahi atu aorangi.""

This translates to: ""Some people wonder what is out there, with some believing in aliens or other life forms that might exist on another planet.""
This directly supports option C.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   A: The passage implies that people only *imagine* that humans can travel to other stars, not that it has already happened.
*   B: The passage is about the possibility of exploring other worlds, not that it is impossible.
*   D: The passage states that the distance between stars is ""trillions of miles,"" which is much more than a billion kilometers."
He aha te mea ka māmā ake i a koe e neke atu ana i te pokapū o te Rā?,"The correct answer is **C: Korohū** (Haurehu).

The passage states ""Ka iti iho te haurehu i a koe ka toro atu ai mai i te pokapū o te Rā"" which translates to ""The gas decreases as you move away from the center of the Sun"". Therefore, gas is lighter as you move away from the center. The Māori word for gas is haurehu which is translated as korohū.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea wāhanga o te rā e kitea ana i te Whenua?","The correct answer is **C: Te whakaahua**.

The passage states: ""Ko te wāhanga ki waho e kitea ana e tātou i te tiro atu ki te Rā e kīia ana ko te photosphere, ko tōna tikanga ko te """"pōro o te tūrama"""".""  This translates to: ""The outer part that we see when we look at the Sun is called the photosphere, which means """"sphere of light"""".""
"
Ko tehea o ngā kitenga e whai ake nei i āwhina ki te whakapumautia i te ariā a Copernicus?,"The correct answer is **A: Ko ngā wāhanga o Venus (The phases of Venus)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""I tautoko ngā mata o Meremere i te ariā o Copernicus ka rere ngā aorangi huri noa i te Rā."" (The phases of Venus supported the theory of Copernicus that planets revolve around the Sun).
"
Ko tehea o ēnei mea i kitea e Galileo Galilei i te tau 1610?,"The correct answer is **B: Ko ngā wāhanga o Venus (The phases of Venus)**.

The passage states that Galileo Galilei used a telescope in 1610 to see that Venus had phases, like the moon. The other options are either incorrect or were discovered by someone else (Horrocks).
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, no hea te awa o Amazon e kohi wai ai?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā awa iti ake**.

The last sentence of the paragraph states: ""Kei te kohi ia i te wai mai i ngā tini mano awa iti iho."" This directly translates to ""It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.""
"
Ko tēhea accolade ehara i te take ki te Awa o Amazon?,"The correct answer is **C: Ko te awa tino roa tēnei**

The passage states that the Amazon is the *second longest* river, not the longest. All the other options are supported by the information in the passage.
"
Ko tehea rārangi mahi e whakahuatia ana i roto i te wāhanga e mahi ana i te iti rawa o nga Venezuelan?,"The correct answer is **C: Hinu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""kotahi ōrau anake kei te mahi ki te ahumahi hinu"" (only 1% work in the oil industry).
*   It mentions that ""he haurima kei roto i te ahuwhenua"" (one fifth work in agriculture), ""tata ki te koata ka mahi ki roto i te ahumahi"" (around a quarter work in industry), and ""He rua hautoru Venezuela e mahi āna kei roto i te wāhanga ratonga"" (two-thirds of Venezuelans work in the service sector).

Therefore, the oil industry employs the smallest percentage of Venezuelans."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā wāhanga e whai ake nei e whakamahi ana i te nuinga nui rawa o ngā Venezuelan?","Based on the text provided, the correct answer is:

**A: Ratonga**

The text states that ""e rua hautoru Venezuela e mahi āna kei roto i te wāhanga ratonga"" (two-thirds of Venezuelans who are employed work in the services sector), which is the largest proportion compared to the other sectors listed.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te hononga e āhei ai ngā whetū ki te mahi?","The correct answer is **C: Hoatu te mārama me te wera** (Give light and heat).

The passage explicitly states that stars are hot and emit light, and that this is due to the energy produced by nuclear fusion.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai hua ana hei hanga i tētahi pūkaha pūtaiao?,"The correct answer is **A: Hauwai**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states that stars produce energy by fusing hydrogen atoms. Scientists are trying to replicate this process. Therefore, hydrogen is the key element used in this type of scientific engine.
*   The other options are not directly used in the same way:
    *   Stars are the source of the process, but not the input to the engine.
    *   Atoms are too general, it is only specific atoms (hydrogen) used.
    *   Energy is the output, not the input."
He aha te hanganga matū o te wai?,"The correct answer is **D: E rua ngā ngota hauwai me te ngota hāora kotahi**.

The passage states: ""Kua hangaia te pūhui wai ki ngā ngota hauwai e rua, me te ngota hāora kotahi.""
"
"Ka huri ngā āhua o te wai, he aha te mea ka noho tonu?","The correct answer is **A: hanganga rāpoi ngota**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the molecular structure of a compound remains the same regardless of its state (gas, liquid, or solid). It gives the example of water (H2O) maintaining its two hydrogen and one oxygen atom structure even when it is in the gas, liquid or solid state.
*   **Kiato** (Density) changes when water changes state (ice is less dense than liquid water).
*   **Āhua Ōkiko** (Physical state) is the very thing that's changing (gas, liquid, solid).
*   **hauota wai** (Liquid nitrogen) is not relevant to the question, which is about the properties of water."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i te take mō ngā kāwanatanga tekau mā toru i te wa e ngana ana ki te whakatakoto i ētahi ture?","Based on the passage, the answer is **B: He kore mana i roto i te Whare Pāremata**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Te arotahi kaha a ngā mana ā-iwi (Strong focus of the civil powers):** This is mentioned as a problem because the states were unwilling to cooperate with the national government and often had absent representatives.

*   **C: Ko ngā whakarerekētanga e hiahiatia ana he whakaaetanga kotahi (Amendments required unanimous consent):** The passage explicitly states that the Articles required unanimous consent for amendments, making this a problem.

*   **D: He mana whakahaere ā-motu kāore e wātea ana (No independent national governing body):** The passage mentions that there was no national executive branch to enforce laws.

*   **B: He kore mana i roto i te Whare Pāremata (No authority in the Parliament):** In this case, the passage says ""kāore i whai mana tō te kaunihera ki te whakatau tāke (The Congress had no authority to decide on tax)"", which is the same as ""He kore mana i roto i te Whare Pāremata (No authority in the Parliament)"".

"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tēhea kōrero e whakaatu tika ana i te āhua o te kāwanatanga pokapū i te wā o te Pakanga Whakawhitiwhiti?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **C: Kāore ngā māngai kāwanatanga i tae atu.**

E ai ki te wāhanga, ""he nui ngā wā e matangaro ana ā rātou māngai"" (their representatives were often absent), e whakaatu ana kāore ngā māngai kāwanatanga i tae atu ki ngā hui.

He aha i hē ai ngā atu whakautu:

*   **A: I whakaūtia nga tāke e nga mana o te Rōpū Nui me nga mana kāwanatanga:** E kī ana te wāhanga kāore i whai mana tō te kaunihera ki te whakatau tāke (the Congress did not have the power to impose taxes).
*   **B: I whakawhirinaki ngā whakarerekētanga ki ngā Tuhinga ki te mana o te Kaunihera:** E kī ana te wāhanga kei te hiahiatia e ngā Atikara te whakaaetanga a te katoa mai i ngā takiwā katoa i mua i te panoni (The Articles required unanimous consent from all states for amendments).
*   **D: E rua ngā wāhanga matua o te kāwanatanga pokapū:** E kī ana te wāhanga i hanga e ngā whenua tekau mā toru tētahi kāwanatanga ā-motu ngoikore - ā, ko te Congress tōna waehanga anake (the thirteen states formed a weak national government - with only Congress as its branch). Nā reira, kotahi anake te waehanga."
Me pēhea te tuhi i ngā kupu i te taha o muri o te Whakapuakanga Mātauranga?,"Based on the passage, the answer is **C: Whakarunga Whakararo (Upside Down)**.

The passage states: ""Ka kitea te tuhinga i raro o te tuhinga, e hurirapa ana."" This translates to ""The writing can be found at the bottom of the document, upside down.""
"
Ko tehea o ngā mea e whai ake nei e mōhiotia ana a Singapore?,"The correct answer is **A: Kākāriki Taone**.

The passage (P) explicitly states that Singapore transformed into a ""Garden City"", which translates to ""Kākāriki Taone"" in Māori.  The other options are not mentioned or implied in the passage.
"
He aha te Vanda Miss Joaquim?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: He putiputi**.

The passage states that ""i kōwhiritia a Vanda Miss Joaquim, arā ko tētahi momorua māika, hei pua ā-motu o te whenua"" which translates to ""Vanda Miss Joaquim, which is a hybrid orchid, was chosen as the national flower of the country"". Therefore, Vanda Miss Joaquim is a flower.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, He aha te kounga o ngā pirimeti o Giza e kore e miharo ki ngā Ihipiana o te Emepaea Hou?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **C: tō rātou rahi**.

E ai ki te wāhanga, kore rawa i pahika ngā koeko o Giza i te **rahi** me te kounga hangarau o te hanganga. I mīharo ngā tāngata Īhipa tawhito New Kingtom ki ngā tohu whakamaumahara o ō rātou tūpuna. Ko te mea i āta tohuhia ko te rahi o ngā koeko o Giza he mea whakahirahira.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, nō whea ngā kai otaota e haere mai ana ki te whai i ngā ua?","The correct answer is **C: Nga mania ki te tonga**.

The passage states the wildebeest move *from* the southern plains *to* the northern hills.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, He aha te rohe e wehe atu ai ngā kai otaota i tētahi wā i te marama o Āperira?","E ai ki te kōrero, ka hoki atu ngā kaiota ki te raki kia oti rā anō ngā marangai i te marama o Aperira. Kāore te kōrero e kī ana i te rohe motuhake i wehe atu ai rātou, engari e kī ana ka haere rātou ki te raki. Ko te rohe Serengeti kei te raki o ngā mania ki te tonga.

Nō reira, karekau he whakautu e tika ana i roto i ngā kōwhiringa i hoatu. Engari, ki te whiriwhiri i te mea e tata atu ana ki te tika, ko **A: Te rohe Serengeti** te mea e pai ake ana, nō te mea kei te hoki atu rātou ki te raki, ā ko te rohe Serengeti kei te raki.
"
He whakaekenga a Operation Sealion ki tēhea whenua?,"The correct answer is **B: Britain**.

The passage states that Germany named their planned invasion of the island of Britain ""Operation Sealion"".
"
He aha te ingoa o Tiamana mo te whakaeke ki Britain?,"The correct answer is **B: Whakahaere Sealion**.

The passage states: ""I whakaingoatia munangia e Tiamani te āki ki te """"Operation Sealion""""."" which translates to: ""Germany secretly named the attack """"Operation Sealion"""".""
"
He aha te mea e kore e whakahuatia hei taahiraa e hiahiatia ana i roto i te mahere a Itari ki te hopu i nga whenua o Awherika?,"The correct answer is **B: Te hanga kaipuke anō**.

The passage states that Italy had just built four ships before the war. The focus of their plan was on using existing resources and strategically eliminating British influence, not on further shipbuilding. The passage mentions ""peia atu e rātou ngā hanganga me ngākaipuke nō Peretānia ki Īhipa."" This means that Italy was eliminating existing British installations and ships in Egypt. They are removing (peia atu) British installations, which is similar to the destruction mentioned in option D.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te take tuatahi o Itari mo te whawhai?","The correct answer is **A: Te hopu i ngā whenua o Āwherika**.

The passage states directly that Italy's primary goals were African lands (""Ko ngā whāinga matua a Itaria ko ō Awherika whenua.""). The rest of the passage explains the reasoning behind this goal and the actions taken to achieve it.
"
Ko wai i whakapūmau i ngā whanaungatanga hoa ki ngā kaiwhawhai?,"The correct answer is **B: Te Wīwī Vichy**.

The passage states that the ""Vichy"" French made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with them.
"
Ko wai nga Allies i roto i te Mahi Tarakona?,"The correct answer is **A: Ko ngā Amerikana me ngā Wīwī Koreutu**.

The passage explicitly states: ""I roto i ngā wiki e rua noa i wetekina e ngā Amerikana me ngā hōia Wīwī Free French te tonga o Wīwī"".
"
Na te whanaketanga o te hangarau i tīmata ai ngā kaipuke moana ki te haere i raro i te wai?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: Hihiani**.

The passage states that due to the development of **radiotelegraphy** (which translates to ""radiotelegrams"" or ""wireless telegraphy,"" and the English word is ""wireless""), submarines had to submerge to avoid detection. The passage emphasizes how new technology made these vehicles very dangerous.
"
"I te wā o to rātau whakamahinga tuatahi, he iti rawa te whānuitanga o ngā kaipuke moana i roto i tehea rohe?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: Te pupuhi**.

The passage states: ""I ērā rā he pōturi ngā waka nei, ā, kāore nei e tino whānui te pūhitanga o ngā pū."" This translates to ""In those days, these ships were slow, and the range of the guns was not very wide."" This clearly indicates that the ""pūhitanga o ngā pū"" (range of the guns/shooting) was limited during their early use.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, nāna i tūkino te whakaaetanga? ","The correct answer is **D: Te Soviets**

The passage states that the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded Poland and violated several treaties including the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties. This clearly indicates the Soviets broke the agreements.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i mahia e te Rōpū Whero?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko:

**A: Te hanganga o tētahi mua Ākarana**

Ko te kōrero e kī ana i whakaekea e te Rōpū Whero ngā rohe ki te rāwhiti o Pōrana (B), i takahi i ngā tiriti (D), ā, i neke atu i te 800,000 hōia ki roto i Pōrana (e pā ana ki te whakatikatika i te taha o te rori, engari ehara i te mea matua). Kāore he kōrero mō te hanganga o tētahi mua Ākarana.
"
He aha te mea i tupu ki te Engineer-i-Chief o te Italian Tenth Army?,"The correct answer is **C: I hopukina a ia e te Ingarangi**.

The passage states that ""...i mau i a Peretānia te Tenth Army's Engineer-in-Chief nō Itāria, a General Lastucci."" This translates to ""Britain captured the Italian Tenth Army's Engineer-in-Chief, General Lastucci.""
"
I hea i patua ai a Italo Balbo?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobruk**.

The passage states: ""Nō te 28 o Hune, nā ngā pū i Tobruk i mate ai a Marshal Italo Balbo..."" which translates to ""On June 28th, the guns in Tobruk killed Marshal Italo Balbo...""
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā pūkenga e whai ake nei he wāhi hira o te whakaaroaro o Tibetan?","The correct answer is **C: kitenga ana i ngā Atua** (visualizing deities).

The passage explicitly states: ""Ko te pokapū o te whakatau whakaaro Tipete ko te Deity Yoga. Mā te whakaaro ā-ataata ki ngā tini atua ka whakawāteatia ngā ia ngoi, ka kāngia ngā hakara (chakra), ā, ka hangaia te māramatanga."" This translates to: ""The center of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Visualizing deities clears energy channels, activates chakras, and generates enlightenment.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te whakatinana i ngā whakangungu manawa** (Implementing breathing exercises): While breathing exercises are mentioned in relation to Kundalini Yoga, they are not explicitly identified as a central part of *Tibetan* meditation as described in the passage.
*   **B: Ngā mahi tukurua** (Repetitive practices): Repetitive practices or ""mantra"" is mentioned but it relates to Kundalini Yoga and not specifically to the practice of Tibetan meditation.
*   **D: Ngā Poutāpeta o te ioka matua** (The Pillars of Main Yoga): The passage does not talk about any pillars of main Yoga, only the practices relating to the ioka or yoga from India."
"""E ai ki te wāhanga nei, me pehea te mahi o nga chakras i roto i te """"pokapū"""" o te whakaaroaro Tibetan?""","The correct answer is **B: Mā te kite i ngā atua**.

The passage states: ""Mā te whakaaro ā-ataata ki ngā tini atua ka whakawāteatia ngā ia ngoi, ka kāngia ngā hakara (chakra), ā, ka hangaia te māramatanga."" This directly links visualizing deities to the activation of chakras.
"
Ko wai i whakatangi i te waiata tapu tuarua i te hōtaka?,"The correct answer is **D: Jai Shankar Choudhary**.

The passage states: ""I tīmata te kaiwaiata a Sanju Sharma i taua pō, whai muri mai ko Shankar Choudhary."" This translates to ""The singer Sanju Sharma started that night, followed by Shankar Choudhary."" Therefore, Shankar Choudhary was the second singer. Note that the name in the original text is ""Shankar Choudhary"", which matches option D, but I assumed that ""Jai Shankar Choudhary"" was the intended name.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, nāna i whakatakoto he waiata whakangākau i te wā o te whakahere kai?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

The passage states: ""I tuku hoki a Lakkha Singh i te chhappan bhog bhajan."" This clearly indicates that Lakkha Singh presented a devotional song during the food offering (chhappan bhog).
"
He aha te whakaaturanga tuarua whakamutunga o te ahiahi?,"The passage says that Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina and Haris Alexiou performed *before* the Fire of Anatolia. Therefore, the second-to-last performance was Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina and Haris Alexiou.

The correct answer is A.
"
He aha te iwi o Alessandro Safina?,"The correct answer is **D: Reo Itāria** (Italian).

The passage states ""te tena Itariana me Alessandro Safina"" which translates to ""the Italian tenor Alessandro Safina.""
"
"I runga anō i tēnei wāhanga, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei ehara i te mea pono?","The correct answer is **A: Tērā tētahi ahi i Hana Clara (There was a fire in Santa Clara)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that fire officials, specifically Fire Chief Scott Kouns, were handing out water to passengers. This implies their involvement in a situation, but it **does not explicitly state that there was a fire**. They could have been there due to the heat-related risk or another type of emergency.

Let's look at why the other options are true according to the passage:

*   **B: I mau nga tāngata ki runga i te takutai hurihuri (People were stuck on a roller coaster)**: The passage mentions people being ""mau ki tētahi waka rōnaki"" (stuck on a roller coaster car).
*   **C: I hoatu he wai ki nga pāhihi (Water was given to the passengers)**: The passage starts by stating ""I hoatungia te wai ki ngā pāhihi"" (Water was given to the passengers).
*   **D: E 60 meneti te roa ki te tiki i te tangata tuatahi i te waka (It took 60 minutes to get the first person off the car)**: The passage states ""...kotahi hāora i te itinga iho te wā kia puta atu te tangata tuatahi i te waka"" (at least an hour to get the first person off the car). One hour is 60 minutes.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, nāna i kōrero e pā ana ki te taumata wera haumaru?","The correct answer is **B: Te kāpene ahi (The fire captain)**

The passage states: ""I kī te rangatira o te ahi a Scott Kouns..."""" which translates to ""Fire captain Scott Kouns said..."" Since the fire captain is identified as the speaker, and the passage recounts the speaker talking about the temperature, it follows that the speaker discussing the temperature was the fire captain.
"
I hea i puta ai te mate hiko nā te mahi o te tsunami?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

The passage states: ""Kāore he kinonga nui, he whara rānei i rīpoatangia ki Tonga, heoi i ngaro te hiko, ā, nā tenei i ngaro hoki te kaha kia rongo ai i te ohoreretanga mai i te PTWC e pā ana ki te tsunami."" This translates to: ""There was no significant damage or injuries reported in Tonga, however, there was a power outage, and this resulted in the inability to hear the warning from the PTWC about the tsunami.""
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i pēhea te pānga o Tonga e te Outage hiko?","The correct answer is **D: Kāore i taea e ngā mana whakahaere te whiwhi i ngā whakatūpato e hāngai ana.**

The passage states that the power outage in Tonga caused a loss of ability to hear the tsunami warning from the PTWC. This means the authorities couldn't receive the relevant warnings.
"
Nō whea i taea ai e te pirihimana te whakamahi i ō rātou pupuhi radar hei tātai i te tere o te taraiwa a Jonny Reid?,"The correct answer is **A: I a ia e taraiwa ana i te 160km/h**

The passage states that the police could only measure Reid's speed when he slowed down *to* 160km/h. This implies that their radar guns were ineffective at higher speeds on the Black Beauty.
"
"E ai ki te whārangi, he aha i uaua ai te pirihimana o Aotearoa ki te whakarite i te tere o Jonny Reid?","The correct answer is **B: He tino hakahaka te motokā** (The car was very fast).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the police had trouble using their speed guns to track Reid's speed *on the fast Black Beauty*. It was only when he slowed down to 160km/h that they could get a reading. This implies the car's high speed was the reason for the difficulty. The word ""hakahaka"" implies speed or agility.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I te taraiwa a ia i raro i te 160km/h** (He was driving under 160km/h): The passage says they could only measure his speed *when* he slowed *to* 160km/h. This indicates he was often going faster.
*   **C: E whitu noa iho tana taraiwa i runga i te piriti** (He only drove across the bridge seven times): The number of times he crossed the bridge isn't related to the difficulty the police had measuring his speed.
*   **D: He tino tawhito te Piriti Tauranga o Auckland** (The Auckland Harbour Bridge is very old): The age of the bridge is irrelevant to the police's trouble measuring the car's speed."
He aha te wāhi o te rū e pā ana ki Butte?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 maire ki te tonga**.

The text states: ""ā, me te tata ki te 65 km (40 maero) ki te tonga o Butte.""
"
He aha i puta i te wa o te tutu i Abu Ghraib?,"The best answer is **A: Te tukino mauhere** (The abuse of prisoners)

The passage states that Abu Ghraib prison became infamous after the abuse of prisoners came to light following the US-led forces taking control.
"
He aha i rongonui ai te whare herehere o Iraki? ,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **B: I tangohia e ngā ope US te mana** nā te mea e kī ana te P: ""I mōiriiri te whare herehere i muri i te mōhiotanga mai ki te tūkino tangata herehere nō muri i te whai mana a ngā ope nō Ngā Whenua Tōpū o Amerika.""
"
He aha te momo huihuinga i tū ki te War Memorial Stadium o Maui?,"The correct answer is **C: Konohete**.

The passage mentions that entertainment was canceled at the Maui War Memorial Stadium, and that the cancellation would have affected 9,000 attendees and sponsors. It also mentions a band management company, HK Management Inc. These clues strongly suggest that the event was a concert (konohete).
"
Nā wai i whakamārama e pā ana ki te whakakorenga o te takahanga?,"The correct answer is **B: Te kamupene whakahaere**.

The text states ""Kāore te kamupene whakahaere a te pēni, a HK Management Inc., i tuku i tētahi take tuatahi i tā rātou whakakorenga... engari tae atu ki te rangi whai muri i uaparetia ngā take whakariterite."" This means the management company, HK Management Inc., eventually explained the reason for the cancellation.
"
Ko wai te hunga e whakaaro ana ko etahi o nga kainoho o Bishkek te kawenga mo te pahua?,"The correct answer is **none of the above**. The text says that protesters from the south were being blamed for the looting by residents of Bishkek. So the residents of Bishkek are blaming the protesters from the south.
"
Ko wai i whakapae i nga kaiwhakahaere o te tonga mo te parakete?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā tangata whenua o Bishkek**.

The passage states ""I whakawhiua ngā kaiporotēhi nō te tonga e te hunga kei Bishkek e noho ana mō ā rātou mahi whakapōauau,"" which translates to ""The protesters from the south were condemned by those living in Bishkek for their destructive actions.""  Therefore, the people of Bishkek blamed the protesters from the south (from the south) for the violence/disorder.
"
No hea i nui ake ai te hokohoko o te wheako rīngi?,"The correct answer is **A: I muri iho i tētahi āhuatanga i Shark Tank**.

The passage states ""I kī a Siminoff i piki ake ngā hokonga whai muri i tana putanga i te hōtaka Shark Tank i te tau 2013..."". This directly supports option A.
"
I te wā i whakatau ai a Jamie Siminoff ki te tīmata i te Ring?,"The correct answer is **A: Whai muri i te kitenga i tōna pere o te tatau ehara i te mea tika**

The first sentence of the passage states: ""I mua atu, nā te CEO o Ring, nā Jamie Siminoff i kī, i tīmata te kamupene i te wā kāore tāna pere kuaha i te rangona mai i tana toa ki tōna karāti."" This directly translates to ""Previously, Ring's CEO Jamie Siminoff said he started the company when his doorbell couldn't be heard from his workshop to his garage.""
"
I whakawhiwhia e ia wāhanga o Reading Rainbow ngā taunakitanga a ngā tamariki mō te aha?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **D: Ngā Pukapuka**.

Kei te kōrero te kōrero mō te tuku tautohu pukapuka e te hōtaka.  Ko te rerenga whakamutunga o te whiti e whakahua ana ki te ""tīkina mai he pukapuka me te pānui.""
"
He aha pea te take i whakakorea ai te raupapa Reading Rainbow?,"The passage states: ""Kei te whakapono ētahi, pēnei hoki i a Hone Grant, ko te kohinga pūtea me te rerekētanga o te kaupapa ako o te tīwī i oti ai te terenga."" This translates to ""Some believe, like John Grant, that funding problems and changes in the educational television landscape ended the series.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: He iti rawa te pūtea (Insufficient funding)**.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te tautohe i puta mai i ngā rangatira o Amsterdam me te whare taonga e pā ana ki te rākau?,"The correct answer is **B: Ko te tikanga kia tiakina** (It should be protected).

The passage states that the officials argued the tree was a public health threat because it was likely to fall. This implies they did *not* argue it should be protected. The other options are mentioned or implied in the passage:

*   **A: Ka hinga tērā** (It will fall) - This is implied by the officials' concern.
*   **C: Kua tāhaetia ki Fungus** (Has been attacked by Fungus) - The passage explicitly states the tree is affected by a fungus.
*   **D: He mōrearea ki te hauora tūmatanui** (It is a danger to public health) - The passage explicitly states this was their argument.

Therefore, the only option that contradicts the officials' stance is that the tree should be protected.
"
"E ai ki tētahi kaitiaki matua mō te RSPCA, he aha te mea e tika ana kia tirohia?","The correct answer is **D: Abattoirs**.

The passage states that David O'Shannessy of the RSPCA told ABC that abattoirs in Australia are not inspected enough. The call for CCTV cameras is intended to improve this situation, but the underlying problem is the lack of oversight of abattoirs.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te āwhina ki te whakakaha i te hiranga o te oranga ora kararehe ki nga kaimahi o Ahitereiria?","The correct answer is **A: Te tāutanga o ngā kāmera CCTV**

Here's why:

The passage states that Animal Liberation and the RSPCA want to make CCTV cameras compulsory in Australian abattoirs. David O'Shannessy of the RSPCA also says that CCTV would send a strong message to those working with animals that their well-being is important.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mahi a te tangata i hopukina?","The correct answer is **A: Ākonga** (Student).

The passage states ""...i mauheretia tētahi **tauira**..."" which translates to ""...a **student** was arrested...""
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i te wā e hora ana te rongo mo tētahi atu hopunga, ka puritia nga nehunga mo te tokomaha o nga tūpāpaku?","The correct answer is **D: Whā**.

The passage states: ""I horapa te rongo ki te hapori o Red Lake i tēnei rā ki ngā tangihanga mō Jeff Wise me te toru o ngā tokoiwa i patua..."" which means ""The news spread to the Red Lake community today at the funerals for Jeff Wise and three others who were killed..."" Therefore, the funerals were for Jeff Wise *plus* three others, totaling four people.
"
"Hei whakautu ki ngā whakahe, ko tēhea whenua kāore i haere whakamua ki tana kirimana ACTA kua hainatia?","The correct answer is **B: Pōrana**

The passage states ""I te marama kua hipa, he nunui ngā porotēhi i Pōrana i te hāinatanga o te ACTA e taua whenua, me te aha kua whakatau ake te kāwanatanga Pōrana kia kauaka te kirimana e whakamana, mō tēnei wā."" This indicates that Poland decided to not ratify the agreement.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko ēhea o ngā whenua e whai ake nei i whakatau kia whakatārewa i te tukanga uru ki ACTA?","The correct answer is **D: Latvia**.

The passage states: ""I whakaroa tā Latvia me Slovakia whakauru ki te ACTA."" (Latvia and Slovakia delayed joining ACTA).
"
E hia ngā tāngata i whara i te mutunga o ngā aitua whakawera rawa o te iPod?,"The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The passage states: ""Tata ki te 60 ngā kēhi o ngā iPod turingongengonge e wera rawa ana kua pūrongotia, i reira ka kā ngā ahi e ono, ka pāngia te tokowhā e ngā pāhunu māmā."" This translates to ""Around 60 cases of overheating iPods have been reported, where six fires started, and *four were affected by minor burns*.""
"
Ko wai i kī ko ngā aitua whakawera nui kāore i tino nui?,"The correct answer is **D: Apple**.

The passage states: ""I tērā wiki i kī a METI kua whakamōhiotia ia e Apple mō ngā weranga e 34 tāpiri kua pāngia atu, i runga i tā rātou kī """"kāore i te aha""""."" This directly translates to ""Last week METI said that Apple had notified them of 34 additional burn injuries, saying 'it's not a big deal.'""
"
"I a ia e korero ana, he aha ta Steve Jobs i kii ai ka whakahoutia e Apple?","The correct answer is **B: Te Waea**

The passage states ""I te rā nei ka whakahoungia e Apple te **waea**, ka maumaharatia mō ake tonu atu te rā nei."" (""Today Apple will reinvent the **phone**, and this day will be remembered forever."")
"
He aha te take o te kōrero e rua haora a Steve Jobs?,"The correct answer is **C: Hei whakarewa waea hōu**.

The passage states that Steve Jobs said, ""...ka whakahoungia e Apple te waea..."". This clearly indicates the two-hour speech was about launching a new phone.
"
He aha te korero a Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner i te Whare Tapere o Argentina?,"The correct answer is **A: Tōna mana whakahaere**.

The text states: ""I whakapuaki a Mrs. Kirchner i tana takune ki te tono i te tūranga perehitene ki te Argentine Theatre..."" This translates to ""Mrs. Kirchner announced her intention to run for president at the Argentine Theatre...""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ko tōna whakaaro kia oma mo te Senate:** While she did use the theater to launch her Senate campaign in 2005, the passage refers to her current announcement about the presidency.
*   **C: Ko tana pakanga mo te roopu kawanatanga o Buenos Aires:** The text mentions she was a Senate member of the ""apatono ā-takiwā o Buenos Aires"" (Buenos Aires province faction), but the focus is on her presidential announcement.
*   **D: Ko tōna mahere kia wehe atu hei heamana o nāianei:** The text implies she's the current ""Māreikura"" (First Lady), but it does not refer to her quitting the position, but rather moving on to president."
I whakapuaki a Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner i tōna hiahia ki te oma?,"The correct answer is **B: I te whare tapere o Buenos Aires i La Plata**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""I whakapuaki a Mrs. Kirchner i tana takune ki te tono i te tūranga perehitene ki te Argentine Theatre, arā ko te wāhi i whakamahia e ia hei tīmata i tana tautohe i te tau 2005 mō te Senate hei mema o te apatono ā-takiwā o Buenos Aires."" which translates to Mrs. Kirchner announced her intention to contest for the presidential position at the Argentine Theatre. It is specified in the first sentence that La Plata is a city 50km (31 miles) away from Buenos Aires.
* Therefore, the Argentine Theatre is in La Plata. The passage does not state any theatres in Buenos Aires.
"
He aha ngā kitenga a ACMA e pā ana ki Big Brother?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **A: Kāore anō kia Takahitia ngā ture whakatau**.

E ai ki te kōrero, i kitea e te ACMA kāore a Big Brother i takahi i ngā ture rāhui whakaaturanga. No reira, ko te ""Kāore anō kia Takahitia ngā ture whakatau"" te kōrero e hāngai ana ki te kitenga a te ACMA.
"
He aha ngā tawhā me āhei ai ngā pāpāho ki te whakaarohia he ihirangi ipurangi?,"Based on the provided passage, the correct answer is:

**B: Me noho tinana ki runga i te tūmau**

The passage explicitly states: ""hei whakaarohia hei kiko Ipurangi, me noho ā-tinana ki tētahi tūmau.""
"
Ko wai te kaiārahi o te Pāti Liberal o Ahitereiria?,"The correct answer is **B: John Howard**.

The passage states that Peter Costello was seen as a potential successor to Prime Minister John Howard as the leader of the Liberal party. Therefore, John Howard was the leader at the time.
"
He aha i kore ai e whai ahumahi pūngao karihi a Ahitereiria?,"Based on the provided text, the answer is **D: He utu nui rawa**.

Here's why:

*   The text quotes Peter Costello saying that Australia should pursue nuclear power ""when it is economically viable."" This indicates that the current lack of a nuclear industry is due to economic reasons (i.e., it's too expensive).

While the other options (lack of public support, controversial nature, and dangerousness) might be factors in the broader debate about nuclear power, they are not directly addressed in the provided quote as the primary reason for Australia not having a nuclear power industry. Costello specifically mentions the economic aspect as the deciding factor."
Ko wai te kaieke ski i whakataetae me te āwhina a tētahi kaiarahi?,"The correct answer is **C: Maciej Krezel**.

The text states: ""Ko tā Pōrana kaieke retireti tāne kua hauā te ataata a Maciej Krezel, me te kaiārahi a Anna Ogarzynska i oti tekau mā toru i te Super-G."" (The Polish visually impaired male skier Maciej Krezel, with guide Anna Ogarzynska, finished thirteenth in the Super-G.)

This clearly indicates that Maciej Krezel skied with the assistance of a guide (Anna Ogarzynska).
"
Ko tēhea whenua i whakaoti i te tekau o ngā whakataetae Super-G mō ngā wāhine e tū ana?,"The correct answer is **B: Hōrana**.

The passage states ""Netherlands, ko Anna Jochemsen te tuaiwa o te karauna tūru wahine i te Hupa-G īnānahi..."". While no one finished exactly tenth, Netherlands is mentioned. Finland finished eleventh, Australia finished eleventh and Mexico finished fifteenth. Therefore Hōrana is the closest answer.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea kōrero mo Blake ehara i te tika?","Based on the passage:

*   **P:** States Blake defended himself with a weapon against people throwing bottles.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: I hopukina a ia i te tirohanga:** We don't know whether he was arrested at the scene based on this information
*   **B: I whakaae a ia ki te whakaeke:** The passage states he *denied* the accusations. So, this is false.
*   **C: I whakamahia e ia he pou i te wa o te whakaeke:** The passage mentions ""mau rākau"" which means he had a weapon. This isn't wrong.
*   **D: I kī a ia kua makaia nga pounamu ki a ia:** The passage states he claimed to be defending himself from bottles being thrown. This isn't wrong.

**Therefore, the correct answer is B.**"
"I runga anō i te wāhanga, ko tēhea o ngā mea e whai ake nei kāore i puta ki a Blake?","The correct answer is **C: I whakaekea ia ki te pou.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states Blake denied charges of using a weapon for self-defense against people throwing bottles. This implies he was *attacked* with bottles, not tied to a post.
*   The passage mentions the trial and conviction for attempting to pervert the course of justice (A).
*   The passage says he was immediately imprisoned, meaning he was arrested (B).
*   The judge warned him a prison sentence was ""virtually certain"" (D).

Therefore, being attacked with bottles (and by extension, tied to a post) wasn't something directly mentioned as happening *to* Blake as part of the *outcome* of the trial.
"
He aha e kore ai e whakamahia te tahua o te UN mō te pāmahana o te ao?,"The passage states the funds from the UN are intended to support countries affected by global warming to overcome the impacts. The passage also mentions specific examples of what the money could be used for, including flood control facilities, better water management, and expanding the diversity of food crops.

Let's analyze the answer choices:

*   **A: whakaputa kai (food production)** - The passage mentions ""whakawhānui i te kanorau huanga kai"" (expanding the diversity of food crops) which falls under food production. So, this is a possible use of the funds.
*   **B: Te kawe i te hangarau ki ngā whenua whanaketanga (Transporting technology to developing countries)** - The first sentence mentions sharing technology to help developing islands grow in ways that pollute less. This is directly related to the passage.
*   **C: Whare whakatika waipuke (Flood control facilities)** - The passage specifically states ""ngā whare haukoti waipuke"" (flood control facilities) as a potential use of the funds.
*   **D: E whakaiti ana i ngā pānga o te whakamahana o te ao (Reducing the impacts of global warming)** - This is the overarching goal of the fund, as stated in the passage: ""hei tautoko i ngā whenua e pāngia ana e te mahana haere o te ao kia puta i ngā pānga"" (to support countries affected by global warming to overcome the impacts).

Given this analysis, the question asks ""He aha e kore ai e whakamahia te tahua o te UN mō te pāmahana o te ao?"" (What is the UN's budget for global warming NOT used for?). Based on the passage, all the options, A, B, C and D could use the UN funds for global warming. Therefore, the question does not correlate to the information in the passage. Assuming the questions intends to ask what the UN funds ARE used for, options A, B, C and D are all correct.

Final Answer: All options A, B, C, and D are accurate, as they all correspond to how the UN's climate change fund is used, as described in the passage.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga, he aha te mea e tumanako ana te UN ki te whakaora?","The correct answer is **C: E toe ana i ngā ngahere**.

The passage states: ""Ko ētahi atu kaupapa ki te rārangi take ki Bali ko te whakarauora i ngā ngahere o te ao e toe ana..."" which translates to ""Other items on the agenda in Bali include the restoration of the world's remaining forests...""
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i whakahuahia e Albert Muchanga hei mea e hiahiatia ana kia whakaaetia?,"The correct answer is **A: Mēnā ka hono a Benin ki AfCTA**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Albert Muchanga announced Benin would be joining (implying it was already decided).
*   He mentions the date trade could start (B).
*   He mentions the Rules of Origin (C) needed agreement.
*   He mentions concessions (D) were not yet agreed upon."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te take e tīmata ai te tauhokohoko i a Hōngongoi?","The best answer is **B: He nui tonu te anga o ngā ture me ngā mana uru kei te wāhi**.

Here's why:

*   The quote says ""Kāore anō mātou kia whakaae ki ngā ture o te ahunga mai me ngā tukunga tāke hoko tāwāhi, engari ko te pou tarāwaho kei a tātou he rawaka kia tīmata tehokohoko hei te 1 o Hōngongoi, hei te tau 2020"". The fact that the framework is ""enough"" to start trading implies there's still work to be done on the complete set of rules and procedures.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A:** While Nigeria's announcement is related, the passage focuses on *why* trade can start in July despite incomplete rules.
*   **C:** The Commissioner announced Benin's joining, but the passage doesn't explicitly say they *approved* starting trade in July. It's implied, but B is a more direct answer.
*   **D:** The passage explicitly states that the rules of origin and tariff concessions **have not** been agreed upon yet."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea i whakapae ai te Atlanta Journal-Constitution ki ngā apiha mātauranga?","The correct answer is **C: Kāore i te mahi i ngā raruraru ā-roto kua kitea**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""...i whakapaetia i kitea ki roto i te kura ngā raru engari kāore i mahi i runga i aua kitenga."" This translates to ""...it was suspected that problems were found within the school but they did not act on those findings.""

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Te whakararuraru i te pūrongo Journal-Constitution:** The Journal-Constitution did not report on the officials messing with the report, but instead reported the problems itself.
*   **B: Kāore e taea te whakahou i te mātauranga tāone:** The Journal-Constitution reported on the fact that the test scores seemed suspicious.
*   **D: Te whakaatu i nga tohu whakamatautau iti:** The Journal-Constitution reported on an issue that involved test scores going up, not down."
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i hoatu i roto i te wāhanga, he aha te mea kihai i whakahuatia i roto i te pūrongo o te Atlanta Journal-Constitution?","The correct answer is **D: Ngā huatau mō te whakahou i te mātauranga taone (Ideas for reforming city education)**.

Here's why:

*   **A: whakapai ake i te tapeke whakamātautau rerekē (Inconsistent test score improvements)** - The passage mentions that the report revealed an impossible increase in test scores.
*   **B: He taunakitanga kua whakarerekētia ngā pepa whakamātautau (Evidence that test papers had been altered)** - The passage says the evidence determined that Hall and 34 others had manipulated papers.
*   **C: Te Kaiwhakahaere ā Iwi o te Tau 2013 o te tau toa (2013 Superintendent of the Year award winner)** - The passage only mentions that she won Superintendent of the Year in 2009.

Therefore, the only thing NOT mentioned in relation to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution report is ideas for reforming city education. The report focused on the suspicious test scores and alleged cheating."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha ngā mōhiohio e mōhiotia ana e whai ana i te poho?","The correct answer is **A: Te tatau whara whakamutunga (The final injury count)** and **D: Te tawhiti o te mate whai mana (The official death toll)**

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states:** ""...kāore anō ngā tau otinga kia whakatau (final figures have not yet been determined)"" - This directly indicates that the final injury count (A) is not yet known with certainty.
*   **The passage states:** ""...ko ngā rīpoata ōkawa e whakaae ana ki ngā wharanga tae atu ki te 30; (official reports acknowledge injuries up to 30)"" - This indicates that the final injury count is uncertain.
*   **The passage states:** ""...ē ai ki ētahi rīpoata ka whakatau i te nui o ngā mate ki te waru, ā, ko ngā rīpoata ōkawa e whakaae ana ki ngā wharanga tae atu ki te 30; (some reports put the death toll at eight, and official reports acknowledge injuries up to 30)"" - This indicates that the official death toll (D) is uncertain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ko ēhea whare i pakū tata ai nga pomu (Which buildings the bombs went off near)** - The passage states ""E toru anō ngā poma i pahū tata ki ngā whare o te kāwanatanga (Three more bombs went off near government buildings)"", so we *do* know this to some extent; they were near government buildings.
*   **C: Mehemea me whakapakū ētahi atu pomu (Whether other bombs might explode)** - The passage gives no indication of this.

"Mai i tana taunga ki Manchester City i te tau 2017, e hia ngā tukinga i takaro ai a Ihu?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **D: 53**

E kī ana te kōrero ""Mai i taua wā, 53 ngā kēmu kua kitea te tangata nei o Brazil mā te karapu ki ia whakataetae""."
Ko tēhea karapu i whiwhi ai a Ihu i te utu £27 miriona mo te hono?,"The correct answer is **B: Tāone Nui o Menetaeta**.

The passage states that Jesus moved to Manchester City for £27 million. ""Tāone Nui o Menetaeta"" is the Māori translation of Manchester City.
"
Ko tēhea kōrero e pā ana ki ngā manuhiri o te whare noho kore he pono?,"The correct answer is **D: Ko te nuinga o nga manuhiri no te taone tapu (The majority of the guests are from the holy city).**

Here's why:

*   **P: I horo tētahi wharenoho ki Mecca, te tāone tapu o Ihirama i te takiwā o te 10 karaka i te ata i te wā ā-takiwa.** The lodging was in Mecca, which is a holy city of Islam. However, the guests were not necessarily from the city.

*   **P: I noho ētahi tāngata hāereere ā-hāhi ki te whare i tae mai rātou ki te toro ki te tāone nui tapu i te ahiahi pō o te haerenga ā-hāhi hajj.** This states that the pilgrims came to visit the holy city. Therefore they are not originally from the holy city.

*   **P: Ko te nuinga o ngā manuhiri mai i te hōtēra he kirirarau o te United Arab Emirates.** This indicates that most of the visitors from the hotel are citizens of the United Arab Emirates.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: I Mekaha nga manuhiri mo te noho manene.** While the guests are pilgrims to Mecca, the question asks what is definitely *false*. It could be true the pilgrims are there to live, we are unsure from the text. Therefore this answer is not correct.

*   **B: Ehara ētahi manuhiri i te tangata whenua o te rohe.** This is true. They're stated to be from the United Arab Emirates, making them non-local to Mecca. Therefore this answer is not correct.

*   **C: I reira nga manuhiri mo te ahiahi o Hajj.** This is true as stated in the text. Therefore this answer is not correct.

*   **D: Ko te nuinga o nga manuhiri no te taone tapu** The guests are in Mecca to visit the holy site, not because they are from the city. Therefore this answer is correct.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā tauākī e whai ake nei e pono ana?","The correct answer is **C: I reira ngā manuhiri mō te pō o te haerenga Hajj**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Kaore he mate kino** - This is incorrect. The passage states that the death toll is at least 15.
*   **B: Ko ngā manuhiri katoa nō United Arab Emirates** - This is incorrect. The passage only states that the majority of the hotel guests were citizens of the United Arab Emirates, not all.
*   **C: I reira ngā manuhiri mō te pō o te haerenga Hajj** - This is correct. The passage says the pilgrims arrived the evening before for the Hajj pilgrimage.
*   **D: Ko te nuinga o nga manuhiri ko nga tangata whenua o Mecca** - This is incorrect. The passage states the majority of guests were from the United Arab Emirates."
"I runga anō i te whakawhitinga, he aha te mōhiohio mo te tutukitanga ehara i te rangirua?","The correct answer is **B: Te tauwāhi o te tutukitanga**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the object crashed ""491 māero ki runga i te Ao"" which specifically mentions the location.
*   The passage mentions scientists are ""E ngana tonu nei rātou ki te whakatau i pēhea te nui o te tūtukitanga me te āhuatanga ki te pānga hoki ki te ao.""(still trying to determine the size and impact of the crash) which means the size of the crash(te rahi o te tutukitanga) and the crash on the impact to the Earth(te pānga o te tūtuki ki te Whenua) are still not known.
*   The passage doesn't mention anything about 'te tauwāhi otaota'.

"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha tonu te tikanga kia whakatauria e pā ana ki te tutukitanga?","The correct answer is **D: Te tauine tika o te hinga** (The accurate scale of the impact).

The passage states: ""E ngana tonu nei rātou ki te whakatau i pēhea te nui o te tūtukitanga me te āhuatanga ki te pānga hoki ki te ao"" which translates to ""They are still trying to determine the magnitude of the impact and the effect it will have on the world.""  ""Te nui o te tūtukitanga"" directly relates to ""Te tauine tika o te hinga"" - the accurate scale of the impact.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea wāhi i puritia e Batten i runga i te rārangi o ngā Kaiāwhina Taunaki rawa?","The correct answer is **C: 190th**.

The passage states ""I noho 190 a Batten ki te rārangi 400 Richest Americans o te tau 2008..."" which translates to ""Batten ranked 190th on the 2008 list of 400 Richest Americans...""
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei i whai ake nei i hoatu e Batten he koha?,"The correct answer is **B: Te Whare Wānanga o Virginia**.

The passage states ""...ā, hei kaitoha matua ia ki tērā kura,"" referring to Te Whare Wānanga o Virginia.
"
He aha te mea kāore i te wāhanga o te pire i hainatia e te Kawana a Arnold Schwarzenegger?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: He aukati i te hoko, i te riihi rānei o ngā kēmu ataata tutu ki ngā tamariki iti i waho o California**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically mentions the bill applies to sales within *California* (""ki te takiwā o Kariwhōnia""). It doesn't say anything about restricting sales outside of California.
*   The other options *are* mentioned in the passage:
    *   A: is effectively what the bill does for California.
    *   B: The $1,000 fine is explicitly mentioned.
    *   D: The ""18"" rating label requirement is a labeling requirement for mature games."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko wai i hapa i nga mea e kōrerotia ana?","The correct answer is **C: Miller**.

The passage says that Miller didn't hear Mike during the trial because he was focused on defending himself. This implies that Miller missed what Mike was saying.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e pono ana ki te wheako o Miller i te whakarongo?","The correct answer is **B: Kaore a ia i aro atu i a ia e takatū ana**.

Here's why:

* **The quote from Miller:** ""i te whakatika au i a au anō, kāore au i rongo i a ia"" translates to ""when I was defending myself, I didn't hear him."" This directly states he wasn't paying attention while he was preparing his own defense.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I miharo a Duvall ki a Miller i te wā o te whakarongo:** The passage doesn't say Duvall interrupted or surprised Miller. It only states that Duvall left a strong impression.
* **C: He maha ngā kōrero a ngā tamariki e rua a Duvall i te wā o te whakarongo:** The passage mentions Duvall has two grown children but says nothing about them talking during the hearing.
* **D: I te āta titiro atu a ia ki te pūrākau a Duvall:** The opposite is true. Miller explicitly states he *didn't* hear Duvall because he was focused on his own defense.
"
Nā wai i huatau kia mahia ngā arotakenga ki te 'Ture Hau Mā'?,"Based on the text:

*   Stephen Harper agreed to send the ""Clean Air Act"" to a committee for review.
*   Jack Layton requested changes to the bill.

The question asks **who** initiated the review, and Stephen Harper is the one who *agreed* to send it to a committee.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Stephen Harper**"
"""Ko wai i whakakāhore i te whakamahinga o te """"Ture Hau Mā"""" hei mahi pōti tōmua?""","The passage doesn't explicitly state who denied the use of the ""Clean Air Act"" as a pre-election ploy. However, it is implied that Prime Minister Stephen Harper agreed to have the Act reviewed, potentially to address criticisms.

While the passage mentions criticisms from the NDP leader and other MPs, it does not explicitly mention denials from any of the options.

Considering the options and the context, the answer that is best supported by the passage is:

**None of the options are correct**
"
He aha te āhua o te waikawa cyanuric me te melamine i a rātau e mahi tahi ana i roto i te waikura ngeru?,"The correct answer is **C: tioata**.

The passage states that melamine and cyanuric acid interact to form crystals that may obstruct kidney function.
"
He aha ngā mea i kitea e ngā kairangahau mā te pūāhua infrared?,"The correct answer is **B: hanganga Crystal i roto i te mimi kararehe**.

The passage states that the researchers compared the crystal structures found in the urine of affected pets using infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). This means the FTIR was used to identify and analyze the **crystal structures** present.
"
"""Ko wai e kōrero ana ki a Luna ko te """"Queen of Extreme""""?""","The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The passage states: ""Nā Tommy Dreamer i kī """"Ko Luna te Queen of Extreme tuatahi..."""" which translates to ""Tommy Dreamer said ""Luna was the first Queen of Extreme...""""
"
"""Ko wai e kōrero ana ki a Luna he """"hē""""?""","The correct answer is **B: Dustin Runnels** and **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The text says, ""I kōrerotia pēnei e Dustin """"Goldust"""" Runnels """"I pēnei rawa te whanokē o Luna i ahau nei...i nui ake rānei pea...aroha nui ki a ia, ka mokemoke ki a ia...ko te tūmanako kei tētahi wāhi pai ake ia.""""

and ""Nā Tommy Dreamer i kī """"Ko Luna te Queen of Extreme tuatahi. Taku kaiwhakahaere tuatahi. I mate a Luna i te pō o ngā marama e rua. Āhua ahurei pērā i a ia. He wahine kaha.""""""

Both Dustin Runnels and Tommy Dreamer made statements about Luna. Therefore both are correct.
"
He aha kāore i pā ki te atekōkiri i roto i te hinga?,"The correct answer is **A: I pāngia e ia nga mate o te māhunga** (He suffered head injuries).

The passage clearly states ""i pāngia te kaitaraiwa e ngā whara kino ki te upoko"" which translates to ""the driver suffered serious head injuries."" The other options are either true but irrelevant to the question of what happened to the driver, or they are false.
"
He aha te mea kāore i tino kitea i roto i te tākaro a Awherika ki te Tonga i te wā o te whakataetae whutupaoro?,"The correct answer is **C: He mahinga whakapipi i te tīmatanga o te whakataetae**.

The passage states that South Africa started strongly (""i tīmata tika i tā rātou toa 26 - 00"") and that while the game against their southern counterparts was initially tough (""He tino taumaha te āhua i te kēmu ki ō rātou tuakana nō te tonga""), South Africa improved as the tournament progressed (""i piki haere a Āwherika ki te Tonga i te ahunga whakamua o te taiwhanga""). This implies that they may not have started very well, but the question asks what wasn't very noticeable in South Africa's *play* overall. The passage highlights strong defense, ball-handling skills, and teamwork (""Nā te pai o te ārai, nā ngā pukenga pai ki te rāwekeweke i te pōro, nā te mahi tahi""). All these things were very noticeable in their play. Therefore, the lack of an initial stumble is the least noticed aspect."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i te tīmatanga o te kēmu a Āwherika ki te Tonga ki te whakapai ake?","The correct answer is **D: I te haerenga o te whakataetae** (As the tournament progressed).

The passage states: ""heoi anō i piki haere a Āwherika ki te Tonga i te ahunga whakamua o te taiwhanga"" which translates to ""however South Africa improved as the tournament progressed.""
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei kaore e whakaata tika ana i te āhua o te mahi o Haina?","The correct answer is **D: Kāore anō a Haina kia kaweake i ētahi atu motokā i Tiamana.**

Here's why:

*   **P states:** ""...i tērā tau i kawe ake ngā motuka mai i Haina ki Tiamana, ka hipa i Amerika, ko ia te mākete nui rawa"" This clearly indicates China *has* exported more cars to Germany than the US. Option D states the opposite.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: Mai i te mahi whakahōu, kua nui haere te āhua o te whakahaerenga o Haina mai i te mahi whakahōu**: The passage mentions economic reforms led by Deng Xiaoping, implying a shift in economic approach.
*   **B: He mākete nui ake tā Haina mō te kaweake motokā i te Hononga o Amerika**: This is stated explicitly.
*   **C: Ka nui ake pea te GDP o Haina i te United States**: This is mentioned as a future possibility.

Therefore, option D is the only one that is *not* accurately reflecting China's situation based on the provided text."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ina hipa atu te GDP o Haina i Te Hononga o Amerika?","The passage states: ""Ka nui ake pea te GDP o Haina, i tā Ngā Whenua Tōpū o Amerika hei roto tonu i ngā tekau tau e rua."" This translates to ""China's GDP may be larger than that of the United States of America within the next two decades.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **B: I roto i te rua tau** (In within two decades)"
He aha te whakaaro a Hu kia mahia e nga whenua whanaketanga?,"The correct answer is **D: Kei te karo i ngā ara tawhito o te pokenga**.

The passage states: ""I akiaki a Hu i ngā whenua e whanake ana """"kia āraia te huarahi o mua o te parakino i te tuatahi, me te whakapai i muri iho ."""" "" This directly translates to Hu urging developing countries to avoid the old path of polluting first and cleaning up later.
"
He aha kāore i kōrerotia e Hu?,"The correct answer is **A: Te pūtake mo nga tapahi** (The basis for the cuts).

Here's why:

*   **P: *""...Kāore ia i whakarite i ētahi nama mō ngā tapatapahi, e kī ana ka whakaritea i runga i te tāputa o te ohaoha o Haina.""*** translates to ""He did not specify any numbers for the cuts, saying they would be determined based on China's economic calculus."" Thus, he didn't specify the ""pūtake"" or the specifics basis.

*   **B: He tohutohu ki ngā whenua whanaketanga mō te poke** (Advice to developing countries regarding pollution): Hu gave advice, saying developing countries should ""avoid the old path of polluting first and cleaning up later.""
*   **C: He rā e tūmanako ana kia tapahia te kohu waro e** (A date they hoped to cut carbon emissions by): Hu said ""before 2020.""
*   **D: He whika mo te mutunga o te hara waro** (A figure for the ending of carbon emissions): Hu didn't provide an end date or specific figure for ending carbon emissions.

Therefore, option A fits best as a specific point that Hu did *not* discuss."
Ko tehea o ēnei e kī ana a Veerman kāore te āhuatanga i te pai?,"The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

The quote from Richard Veerman of Medicines Sans Frontieres states: ""Angola is facing its worst outbreak, and it's particularly bad in Angola"". He is saying the situation is not good *in* Angola."
"Nā te whakawakanga, ko wai ka tango i te tūranga kāwanatanga a Huhne?","The correct answer is **A: Davey**.

The passage states ""Kua heke a Huhne i tana tūranga, kua eke mai ko Ed Davey ki te komiti whāiti."" This directly indicates that Ed Davey took over Huhne's position.
"
Ko wai ka riro i a ia te tūranga Minita Pakihi i muri i te whakawakanga?,"The correct answer is **A: Lamb**.

The passage states that Norman Lamb MP is expected to replace Huhne as the minister for Business.
"
He aha te mea e akiaki ana nga kaiwhakaari i te hunga whakarongo ki te mahi i roto i te opera a Camille Saint-Saens?,"The correct answer is **A: Partake i te whakamahinga o Cannabis**.

The passage states that the actors smoke ""momi tarupai"" (cannabis cigarettes) on stage and encourage the audience to join them.
"
Ko wai te nuinga o nga kauruki i te wā o te opera?,"The correct answer is **A: Te rehetoi**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the story is about an artist (""ringa toi"").
* The passage says the artist's life is ""marked by a love of drugs and Japan.""
* The passage says the *performers* smoke drug-like substances on stage, implying they are *portraying* the actions of the artist, not necessarily *being* drug users themselves.

Therefore, the artist is the one most associated with drugs in the context of the opera.
"
"""He aha tētahi atu ingoa mo te """"haere mokowā"""" i mahia e Rua?""","The correct answer is **C: Hohenga ā-roto**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Leonov performed the first ""māhi tuatahi ki waho o tētahi waka (EVA), te """"hīkoi tuarangi"""" rānei..."".
*   The passage then states ""nāna i ārahi te wāhanga Soviet o te haerenga Apollo-Soyuz i reira i tohua ai kua oti te Space Race."" which means Apollo-Soyuz was a separate event.

The other options are incorrect:

*   A: ""Te mahi a Aporo-Soyuz"" (Apollo-Soyuz mission) was a later event.
*   B: ""Whakataetae Mokowā"" (Space Race) was the overall competition, not a name for the spacewalk itself.
*   D: ""Cosmonaut Kāo. 11"" (Cosmonaut No. 11) was Leonov's identifier within the Soviet program."
Na Ruaov i ārahi te wāhi o Rōpūria o tēhea mahi?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**.

The passage states ""tekau tau ki muri, nāna i ārahi te wāhanga Soviet o te haerenga Apollo-Soyuz i reira i tohua ai kua oti te Space Race"" which translates to ""Ten years later, he led the Soviet section of the Apollo-Soyuz mission where the Space Race was signaled to be over."" Thus, the correct answer is B.
"
Ko wai i whara i te hinga?,"The correct answer is **A: Gibson**.

The passage states that ""I muri i te pānga o te aituā, i kawea a Gibson ki tētahi hōhipera engari kāore i roa ka mate ia."" (After the impact of the accident, Gibson was taken to a hospital but soon died.) This clearly indicates that Gibson was injured in the accident. The other options are explicitly mentioned as not being injured or it is unclear whether they were.
"
He aha i pā ki te iwi i roto i te aituā?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: Kotahi i whara, kotahi i mate** (One was injured, one died).

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""I muri i te pānga o te aituā, i kawea a Gibson ki tētahi hōhipera engari kāore i roa ka mate ia."" (After being involved in the accident, Gibson was taken to a hospital but soon died.) This indicates one fatality.
*   The text also states: ""Kāore i whara te kaitaraiwa taraka, e 64 te pakeke, i te tukituki."" (The 64-year-old truck driver was not injured in the collision.) This indicates one person was not injured.

The passage does not explicitly state if Gibson was injured or simply died from the impact. However, it implies that he was likely injured and later died from those injuries.

Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they don't accurately reflect the information given in the text about the specific outcomes of the accident. The children were present, but not directly involved in the immediate accident. The text also mentions that the truck driver was unharmed.
"
I tūmanako nga kaipūtaiao e mahi ana i te hōtaka kia kite i ngā pānga i puta mai i tēhea o ēnei?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **B: Ngā tōpana Tidal**.

**Whakamārama:**

E ai ki te kōrero, i tūmanako te tīma kia kite i tētahi hua ""ka rewangia ake e ngā ngarungaru kaha i waenga i te pō uriuri o te ikarangi me te pō tangotango o te mangōroa"". Ka whakatauritea tēnei ki te tō mai a te marama me tana whakarite i ngā tai. Ko ngā tai he hua o ngā tōpana *tidal*. Nō reira, ko te whakautu e tino rite ana ki te kōrero ko ""Ngā tōpana Tidal"".
"
Ko tehea o ngā mea e whai ake nei i kitea e ngā kaipūtaiao?,"The correct answer is **D: Te ikarangi Sagittarius me te Ara Miraka** (The Sagittarius constellation and the Milky Way).

Here's why:

* The passage specifically mentions the program being written to align with the views of the Sagittarius constellation and the powerful waves between the dark void of the heavens and the blackness of the Milky Way.
* While the Earth and Moon are mentioned as an analogy, the *discovery* the passage focuses on relates to the interaction within the Sagittarius constellation and the Milky Way."
"I runga anō i te haerenga, he aha te mea e whakahētia ana e nga tohutohu?","The correct answer is **C: Ko wai e whakawhiwhia ana ki ngā kirimana whakahoutanga** (Who is being awarded the renovation contracts).

The passage explicitly states that criticism of the rebuilding effort after Hurricane Katrina focused on ""the awarding of reconstruction contracts to those considered to be insiders in Washington."" This directly corresponds to option C.
"
Ko wai e whakahe ana i ngā kirimana hanga anō mō ngā mahi āwhina o Hurricane Katrina?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngā insider o Washington**.

The passage states: ""Kua aro atu ngā kōrero whakahē huhua o te mahi hanga anō ki te tuku i ngā kirimana hanga anō ki te hunga e whakaarohia ana he hoa nō roto o Washington."" This directly translates to: ""Numerous criticisms of the reconstruction effort have focused on the awarding of reconstruction contracts to those perceived as friends from within Washington."" Therefore, those ""friends from within Washington"" are receiving the contracts, and the criticism is directed at the awarding of contracts to **insiders of Washington**.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ka kitea ngā rama mai i te waka ātea Stardust i te tuatahi?","Based on the passage:

The passage states: ""Ka neke atu i te tai hauāuru i te raki o California, ā, ka whakakā i te rangi mai i California atu ki te pokapū o Oregon atu hoki ki Nevada me Idaho atu hoki ki Utah,"". This translates to ""It will move over the west coast in Northern California, and light up the sky from California to Central Oregon to Nevada and Idaho and also to Utah"".

Therefore, the lights will be seen *first* in **Northern California**.

The correct answer is **B: California ki te Raki**.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ka tautuhia e te waka ātea he pūkete mo tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei?","The correct answer is **C: Hoki ana ki Te Whenua i te tino tere** (Returning to Earth at the greatest speed).

The passage explicitly states: ""Ka whakaritea e te Stardust te rikoata mō te waka aorangi tere rawa kia hoki mai ki te Ao nei..."" (Stardust will set the record for the fastest spacecraft to return to Earth...). This directly supports option C.
"
He pēhea te āhua o Tākuta E pā ana a Malar Balasubramanian ki a Saroja Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **B: Tamahine**.

The passage states ""I rēira rātou kite ai i te tinana o Saroja Balasubramanian, 53, kua uhia ki ngā paraikete toto."" and ""Takuta Malar Balasubramanian, 29"". It is inferred that Saroja Balasubramanian is the mother of Takuta Malar Balasubramanian.
"
I hea te tinana o Sara Parasubramanian i kitea?,"The correct answer is **C: I roto i te pūtake o te motokā**.
"
He aha i whiwhia e eBay?,"The correct answer is **A: Microsoft**.

The passage states that ""eBay hopes to diversify its assets"" and that ""Skype might gain a stronger foothold in places..."". This implies that eBay owned Skype and was selling it off. Given the options, the most likely buyer would be Microsoft.
"
He aha te mea e whai ana a eBay ki te whakatutuki i te hoko?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **B: Whakaroha ki ngā rohe hōu.**

E ai ki te kōrero, e tūmanako ana te kamupene ki te whakawehwehe i ana rawa, ā, e hau ana te rongo i roto i ngā wāhi e mau ai i a Skype tētahi nohoanga kaha, pēnei i a Haina, i te Rāwhiti o Europi me Brazil. Ko ēnei whenua he rohe hou e tūmanako ana a eBay ki te whakaroha atu ki roto.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, kaore rātau i tauwhiti ki nga hoa i noho i roto i te whawhai i muri i te whārangi?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **C: Ngā Āpiha**.

Ko te rerenga kōrero e kī ana ""ka kōkiritia te iāri e ngā āpiha he kaka whawhai ō rātou, me te whakararu i ngā kaiherehere ki te haurehu waikamo"" e whakaatu ana ko ngā āpiha i whawhai ki ngā herehere.  Kāore ngā kōrero e pā ana ki ngā kaiwhakarite, ngā kaimahi whakaora ahi, ngā kaimahi hōhipera rānei e whawhai ana.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei ka hoki whakamuri nga herehere i te whakararuraru?,"The correct answer is **B: hau roimata (tear gas)**.

The passage states that the officers stormed the yard and used tear gas to subdue the prisoners. This suggests the tear gas was the measure taken to stop the disturbance. The other options are either triggers of the disturbance or results of it.
"
"Ki te whakaaro o Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, he aha te mea e tika ana kia whakaorangia te whenua o Iran?","The correct answer is **D: He whakamauru ki te hinu**

The passage states: ""Nā te kaiārahi ariki o te whenua, a Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, i whakaatu i te whirinakitanga ki te hinu hei """"tētahi tārore"""" ... ā, me whakawātea te whenua i a ia anō i taua tārore."" This directly translates to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei wanting Iran to free itself from its reliance on oil.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, nāna i whakaae ki nga pānga o te mana o te rangatiratanga o Ārepa?","The passage states: ""Ko ngā kōrero, e mataora ana ki te pouaka whakaata, ko te wā tuatahi kua whāki ngā puna Irāna mātāmua he pānga tō ngā whiunga."" This translates to ""According to reports, which are pleased with the broadcast, it is the first time that senior Iranian sources have acknowledged that sanctions have an impact.""

Then later in the text, it says ""Nā te kaiārahi ariki o te whenua, a Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, i whakaatu i te whirinakitanga ki te hinu hei """"tētahi tārore"""" i ahu mai i mua i te whananga Ihirama a Irāna i te tau 1979, ā, me whakawātea te whenua i a ia anō i taua tārore."" This translates to ""The country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, described dependence on oil as """"a trap"""" that originated before Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979, and the country must free itself from that trap.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei**. He is the one cited in the passage as acknowledging the negative impact (a trap) of reliance on oil, which is being affected by the sanctions.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i te wāhanga o te tukanga pōti o Wīwī?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: Ngā pōti i kautetia e ngā māngai kaitono.** (The votes are counted by candidate representatives).

Here's why:

*   **A: Ngā pouaka pōti pūataata (Transparent ballot boxes):** The text explicitly states that ballot boxes must be transparent.
*   **B: Ngā māngai i tukuna e ngā kaitono (Representatives sent by candidates):** The text mentions that candidates can send representatives to observe the process.
*   **C: Waitohu ana i tētahi rārangi pōti (Signing a voting list):** The text describes voters signing the voting book after placing their envelope in the ballot box.
*   **D: Ngā pōti i kautetia e ngā māngai kaitono (The votes are counted by candidate representatives):** The text says votes are counted by *volunteers* under strict observation, not by candidate representatives themselves.

Therefore, option D is the only one NOT mentioned as part of the French voting process described in the text."
Kei whea ngā kaipōti e tohu ana i tō rātou kaitono i whiriwhiri?,"The correct answer is **B: I runga i tētahi rau pepa tā tōmua**.

The passage states: ""...ka whakatakoto i tētahi whārangi pepa kua tāngia i mua e tohu ana i te kaitono e kōwhiria ana ki tētahi kōpaki."" This translates to ""...they place a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.""
"
He aha i akiaki ai a Allen ki te tīmata i tētahi rapu waru tau mo te Musashi?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **D: Tōna hiahia ki te whawhai**.

Kei te kōrero te whiti ""i tīmata tana whāinga kia rapu i te Musashi mai i tana aronga mai rā anō ki te pakanga"". Ko tēnei te take i tīmata ai ia i te rapu. Ko ngā rawa, ko te mahere moana, ko te pūtea hōpara moana he take pea i taea ai e ia te mahi i te rapu, engari ehara i te take i akiaki i a ia kia tīmata.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te nui o ana moni i pau i a Allen?","The correct answer is **B: hōpara moana**.

The passage states: ""e kīia ana kua whakangao ia i te nui o āna rawa ki te torohē moana"" which translates to ""it is said that he invested a large amount of his wealth in marine exploration"". While recovering the Musashi was *part* of his marine exploration, the text emphasizes the broader category of exploration as the main area of his investment.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei i puta ai ki ngā āhuatanga mōrearea i roto, i te huri noa rānei i te tipu?","The passage states that ""the radioactive cesium and iodine are appearing at the work site."" It also implies that the fuel containers have been compromised. Therefore, both **B: Radioactive cesium** and **A: konuruke fuel** are factors that contributed to the dangerous situation.

Considering only ONE answer is acceptable, the better answer from the information given would be:

**B: Radioactive cesium**

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically *identifies* the presence of radioactive cesium and iodine as evidence of a potentially compromised situation. The presence of these substances directly indicates a radioactive hazard.
*   The passage *implies* the fuel has been compromised, rather than directly stating it has been compromised. It is therefore a possible answer, but not as strongly suggested as the presence of radioactive material.

I'm therefore going to choose option **B.**"
Ko tēhea o ēnei tohutohu e whai ake nei ehara i te tohutohu haumaru e tūtohutia ana ki ngā kainoho o te rohe whai muri i te aitua i te wheketere?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **C: Karohia te hūnga o te auahi mā**.

**He aha ai?**

* **A: Karohia te whakamahinga o ngā wae āhua hau:** E ai ki te kōrero, ""kia whakaweto i ngā whāhauhau"". Nā reira, he tohutohu haumaru tēnei.
* **B: Noho ki roto:** E ai ki te kōrero, ""kia noho iho ki rō whare"". Nā reira, he tohutohu haumaru tēnei.
* **D: Me kaua e inu wai pato:** E ai ki te kōrero, ""kia kauaka te wai o te kōrere e inungia"". Nā reira, he tohutohu haumaru tēnei.
* **C: Karohia te hūnga o te auahi mā:** Ahakoa he pai te karohia te auahi mā, kāore i te marama i te kōrero i ahu mai te auahi mā i te wheketere. E korero ana te kōrero mo nga pāhotanga pouaka whakaata mo te auahi mā e puta ana i te hanganga, ehara i te mea e tata ana nga tangata ki te wheketere karihi.

Nā reira, ko te whakautu tika ko C, nō te mea, kāore i te marama i te kōrero i ahu mai te auahi mā i te wheketere karihi."
"E ai ki a Tākuta Moll, he aha te mea tino āwangawanga mō te XDR-TB?","The correct answer is **D: He tino mate te pāpātanga**.

The passage states Dr. Moll said the new strain is ""nui te tupono he mea whakararu, he mea pāwera i runga i te pāpātanga hemo tino teitei,"" which translates to ""very likely to be problematic, worrisome because of the very high death rate.""  Therefore, the high death rate is his primary concern.
"
E hia ngā tūroro i mate i te momo hou i whakapumautia he kaimahi hauora?,"Based on the text, the correct answer is **B: 2**.

The passage states: ""...tokorua i te itinga iho he kaimahi hauora hohipera"" which translates to ""...at least two were hospital healthcare workers"".
"
He aha te momo hangarau e whakamahia ana e te pūnaha NextGen?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **A: Hangarau ā-wakarangi**.

E ai ki te kōrero, ""kei te whakamahi ia i te hangarau pūtake-āmiorangi e rerekē ana i ngā hangarau tawhito ake he pūtake-hihiani-papa"". Ko te ""pūtake-āmiorangi"" e tohu ana ki te hangarau ā-wakarangi.
"
He pēhea te whai painga o Te NextGen ki ngā pūmana waka ā hau?,"Based on the provided text, the most accurate answer is a combination of options, but we need to choose the *most* directly supported one. Here's the breakdown:

*   **A: Ararere rere poto ake** - The passage states NextGen allows planes to fly closer together. Flying closer together generally translates to shorter, more direct routes. This makes option A a good answer.

*   **B: Ētahi atu tauwāhi rererangi pū** - The text does not directly suggest that NextGen provides more accurate locations for planes. While the system does use satellite technology to improve precision, it does not say how it will affect the plane's location.

*   **C: he iti iho te kohu waro** - The passage explicitly mentions reduced carbon emissions as a benefit of the system.

*   **D: Hinu iti iho** - The passage explicitly mentions that this saves millions of gallons of fuel.

*While* all the options are somewhat correct and a result of the system, the best answer is:

**D: Hinu iti iho**

*Reason*: The passage uses the phrases ""millions of gallons of fuel each year"" which would best support option D as the answer."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha nga korero a nga kaitoi korero i whakahee i te FBI mo te aro ki runga?","The correct answer is **B: Te tohatoha i ngā rauemi ki ngā hara ngāwari te whakaoti**.

The passage states that storytellers criticized the FBI for allocating resources to cases that were easy to solve, such as car theft, in order to increase the agency's success rate. This aligns directly with option B.
"
He aha te mahi a te FBI i runga i te kaupapa poke?,"The correct answer is **C: Me arotahi ki ngā mahi kino e māmā ana te whakaoti (Focus on crimes that are easy to solve)**.

Here's why:

* **P** states that the FBI has shifted its resources to cases that are easy to solve, like car theft, to improve its success rate. This directly supports option C.
"
He aha te mea i tupu ki te waka ahi i urupare ki te hinganga o te JAS 39C Gripen? ,"The correct answer is **D: I pau te korohū**.

The passage states: ""Kei te pūrongotia e te pāpāho o reira i tūwhiti tētahi waka ahi tauranga waka i a ia e aro atu ana."" This translates to ""Local media is reporting that a fire truck was vaporized when it responded"". The word ""vaporized"" implies that the fire truck was completely destroyed, not just crashed, turned around, or exploded.
"
"Whai muri i te hinganga o te JAS 39C Gripen, i kati te taunga rererangi ki te aha?","The correct answer is **A: Rerenga arumoni**.

The passage states that the crash ""me te aukati i te tauranga waka rererangi ki ngā rerenga ahumoni"" which translates to ""and blocked the airport for commercial flights"".
"
Ko wai i whakahaeretia e Brzezinski i te wā o te Huringa Iranian?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter**.

The passage states that Brzezinski was the National Security Advisor (NSA) during the Iranian Revolution which happened in 1979, and that he was in this role from 1977 to 1981, serving under Carter.
"
Ko wai i tū hei Kaitohutohu Haumarutanga ā-Motu tae noa ki te tau 1977?,"The correct answer is **B: Kissinger**.

The passage states that Brzezinski became National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981, ""ka whai i a Henare Kissinger"" - meaning *followed* Henry Kissinger. This means Kissinger held the position *before* Brzezinski.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kōrero e kore e tino whakaatu i te mahi a Bobek ki Partizan Belgrade?,"The correct answer is **A: Neke atu i te 468 ngā whāinga i riro i a ia i a ia e tākaro ana mo te tīma.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states Bobek played in 468 games and scored 403 goals. Option A is incorrect as it says he scored more than 468 goals. The other options correctly reflect facts mentioned in the passage."
Ko tēhea kōrero e pā ana ki te hītori o Bobek ki Partizan Belgrade he pono?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka tīmata a ia ki te tākaro mo Partizan i te 1945**

This is directly stated in the first sentence: ""Ka tūhono ia ki a rātou i te tau 1945"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: I tākaro a ia mo Zagreb i mua i a Partizan Belgrade** The passage states he was born in Zagreb and became famous while playing for Partizan. It does not say that he played for a Zagreb team before playing for Partizan Belgrade.
*   **C: I tākaro a ia mo Partizan tae noa ki te 1995** The passage states he stayed with the club until 1958, not 1995.
*   **D: I rongonui ia i muri i tana pōti hei kaitakaro pai rawa atu a Partizan** The passage states he became famous *while* playing for Partizan. The 1995 vote happened long after his playing career."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea āhuatanga e whakarerekē ana i nga Hesperonychus mai i te Velociraptor?","The correct answer is **B: He nui ake tōna claw tuarua**

The passage states that Hesperonychus had an enlarged second claw, which led to its name. The other characteristics mentioned (two legs, feathers, warm-blooded) are shared with Velociraptor, according to the passage.
"
"""Ko te tikanga o """"Hesperonychus"""" i takea mai i te āhuatanga ōkiko o te momo?""","The correct answer is **A: Te maikuku (nga)**.

The passage states that the name Hesperonychus, meaning ""claw of the west"", is derived from its enlarged second toe claw. This makes option A the only correct answer.
"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki te pupuhi he pono?,"The correct answer is **D: I pā mai te tākaro i Buffalo**

Here's why:

*   **P: kāore i nui ake i te 100 tāngata i tae ki te pāti, hei whakanui i te huringa tau tuatahi o tētahi tokorua i tū tā rāua mārena i tērā tau. I whakaritea mō te rā whai muri ake tētahi hui huritau ōkawa, e ai ki ngā āpiha. Kua mārena te tokorua ki Texas mō te kotahi tau ki muri, ā, ka haere mai ki Buffalo hei whakanui ki ngā hoa mengā whanaunga. Te hoarangatira 30 tau i whānau i Buffalo, ko ia tētahi o te tokowhā i mate i te pūtanga, heoi kāore tana wahine i pāngia.**

The text states that the couple got married in Texas and came to Buffalo to celebrate with friends and relatives. It also states the shooting caused 4 fatalities.

Let's analyze the other options:

*   **A: No Texas te tāne me te wahine** - While they got married in Texas, it is not said that they are FROM Texas.
*   **B: Tokorima nga tūpāpaku** - The text explicitly states that there were *four* fatalities.
*   **C: Kotahi tau i mārena ai te tokorua i mua i Buffalo** - The text states the couple married a year prior in Texas, and were visiting Buffalo for the anniversary.

Therefore, the only statement that is definitively true based on the text is that the shooting occurred in Buffalo."
Ko tēhea kōrero e pā ana ki te kaupapa i puta ai te pupuhi e tika ana?,"The correct answer is **A: I puta mai i tētahi pō whakanui i Buffalo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the couple held a party to celebrate their first anniversary in Buffalo. The shooting happened at this party.
*   The passage mentions an anniversary party planned for the next day, but it clearly states that the shooting happened during the first party that occurred on the night of the first wedding anniversary celebration
*   The passage mentions that the couple got married in Texas, but the party to celebrate their anniversary was in Buffalo.
*   The passage mentions that the party was for the first wedding anniversary celebration but it does not directly state that it occurred during the wedding of the couple

Therefore, the shooting occurred at a celebration night in Buffalo."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te māharahara tuatahi i waenganui i nga kaiwhakahaere e pā ana ki te Luno?","The correct answer is **C: maringi hinu** (oil spill).

The passage states: ""ā, i te tuatahi i āwangawanga ngā āpiha kei maringi te kawenga"" which translates to ""and at first the officers were worried that the cargo would spill."" and the passage also states ""...hei tiki i tōna kawenga whakahaumako noa..."" which means ""...to pick up its refridgerant cargo"". Therefore the correct answer is ""c: maringi hinu.""
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki te wehenga o Luno ehara i te tika?","The incorrect statement is **B: E 100 mita te pūngao o te kaipuke i runga i te wā i pakaru ai**.

The passage states the ship was 100 meters long (""I te ara te kaipuke 100-mita te roa""), not that it had 100 meters of *energy*.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: I puta te raru i mua i te tango i te utanga** (The problem occurred before the cargo was retrieved): The passage says ""I te ara te kaipuke [...] hei tiki i tōna kawenga whakahaumako noa"" (The ship was on its way [...] to pick up its refrigerated cargo). This confirms the incident happened *before* loading the cargo.
*   **C: I roto i ngā mema o te kapa tekau mā rua, kotahi i whara** (Of the twelve crew members, one was injured): The passage states ""I ora ngā kaimahi tekau mā rua e te topatopa, i toto noa iho te ihu a tētahi"" (Twelve crew members survived by helicopter, with only one having a bloody nose). A bloody nose constitutes an injury.
*   **D: I panaia te kaipuke ki roto i te wai pakaru** (The ship was pushed into the wreckage): The passage says ""I panaia atu e ngā hau pūkeri me ngā ngaru ki te waiwhawhati"" (It was pushed by the strong winds and waves into the wreckage).

Therefore, option B is the only statement that is not supported by the provided text.
"
I te tekau tau i whiwhi ai a Algeria i te rangatiratanga?,"The correct answer is **C: 1960s**.

The passage states ""I ngā tau 1960 i hoki ake mātou ki te motuhaketanga-hou o Algeria ki te whakaako i te arataki kiriata,"" which translates to ""In the 1960s we returned to the newly independent Algeria to teach film direction.""
"
I hea i kore ai e whakaturia ngā mata pouaka whakaata mō te tangihanga?,"The correct answer is **D: I St. Tapawhā o Pita**

The text explicitly states that such large crowds attended that not everyone could enter St. Peter's Square for the funeral. Therefore, screens would not have been needed *inside* the square where the actual service was taking place.
"
I hea te hui nehunga i puritia?,"The correct answer is **C: I St. Tapawhā o Pita** (St. Peter's Square).

The passage explicitly states that the funeral service was held at St. Peter's Square (""...kāore i taea e te katoa te tangihanga nei ki St. Pita Tapawhā te tomo""). While other locations in Rome and elsewhere had screens to view the service, the actual funeral itself took place at St. Peter's Square.
"
"Whai muri i te pahūtanga, ko wai i whakahaeretia mō ngā whara nui?","The correct answer is **B: Karekau he tangata** (No one).

The passage states: ""Kāore ētahi atu whara i pūrongotia"" which translates to ""No other injuries were reported"". While five people were treated for shock, they did not sustain injuries.
"
Ko wai i pūrongo i te māturu korohū?,"The correct answer is **B: Te tangata e noho ana i roto i te whare noho**.

The text states: ""I te tae atu tētahi āpiha nō te kamupene haurehu ki te wāhi rā i muri i te waeatanga atu a tētahi **kiritata** mō tētahi komama haurehu.""

""Kiritata"" translates to ""customer"" or ""client,"" implying someone who uses the gas company's services, therefore, someone who lives in the apartment building.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, e hia nga tāngata i mate i roto i te whakaeke?","The correct answer is **B: 2**

The passage states: ""Ko Nicholas Alden 25 me Zachary Cuddeback 21 ngā tūpapaku.""  ""Ngā tūpapaku"" means ""the deceased"" or ""the dead."" It then names two people: Nicholas Alden and Zachary Cuddeback. Therefore, two people died.
"
Ko wai te patu i kore e pupuhi i tētahi wā i te whakaeke?,"The correct answer is **B: Uka**.

The passage states ""I raru te pū a Uka i te hikitanga ake ki te tangata tuarima,"" meaning Uka's gun malfunctioned when he went to shoot the fifth person."
Ko tēhea o ngā hākinakina e whai ake nei i whakakorea i te hōtaka Olympic?,"The correct answer is **C: Poitake (Baseball)**.

The text states: ""i pōtitia kia panaia atu ērā i Ngā Taumāhekeheke o te Ao i te tau 2005"" which means ""...were voted to be removed from the Olympic Games in 2005"". And ""te peihipaoro me te poiuka"" (baseball and softball) were among those voted to be removed.
"
Ko tēhea o ngā hākinakina e whai ake nei i pōtihia e te Komiti Olympic o Te Ao kia whakaurua ki roto i ngā kēmu?,"The correct answer is **C: Uniana Rugby**.

The passage states ""I tohua ko te whutupōro me te Korowhā..."" which translates to ""Rugby and Golf were chosen...""
"
I rīhi tuatahitia e Arthur Papawhenua te Kēti o St James' Brewery mo te maha o nga tau?,"The correct answer is **D: 9000**

The text states: ""I te 24 o Hepetema, 1759 te tau, i waitohungia e Arthur Guiness he rīhi 9,000 tau te roa... "" which translates to ""On September 24, 1759, Arthur Guinness signed a lease for 9,000 years..."". Therefore, Arthur Guinness initially leased St. James' Gate Brewery for 9000 years.
"
E hia ngā piriona tāra e kawea mai ana e Guinness ia tau?,"The correct answer is **C: 14**.

The passage states that Guinness earns US$14.7 billion per year. Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives us 14.
"
E hia ngā whenua i roto i te Kotahitanga Pākehā kua kitea te huaketo H5N1?,"The correct answer is **C: Whitu** (Seven).

The passage states that France is the seventh country in the European Union to be affected by the H5N1 virus, and then lists six other countries (Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Italy). Therefore, a total of seven countries have been affected.
"
Kei hea te take hōu rawa o te huaketo H5N1 i kitea?,"The correct answer is **A: Wīwī**.

The passage states: ""Kua whakatūturutia te whēnanau mate rewharewha manu patu tangata, H5N1, kia pāngia tētahi rakiraki puihi kua mate... i roto i te rēpō tata atu ki Lyon i te rāwhiti o **Wīwi**.""
"
Nō whea te wā whakamutunga i tutaki ai a Haiti ki te mate i mua i te horahanga e ngā hoia rangimarie?,"The correct answer is **A: Te 1800s**.

The passage states: ""I mua i te taenga atu o ngā ope tauā, kua kore a Haiti i te pāngia e ngā raru e pā ana ki te tahumaero mai i te rautau 1800."" This directly translates to: ""Before the arrival of the troops, Haiti had not been affected by issues related to cholera since the 1800s.""
"
He aha te wāhi i puta mai ai ngā ururua ki te horahanga o te mate?,"The correct answer is **A: Te Awa o Artibonite**

The passage states: ""...ko ngā uruurua mai i te puni UN kāore i tika te horoihia, nā tēnā i uru ngā huakita ki te Awa o Artibonite...""  This clearly indicates the waste entered the Artibonite River, contributing to the spread of the disease.
"
He aha te mea e whakaaro ana te kāwanatanga o Iraki ki te mahi?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **B: Whakanohoia he ture kaha ake mo te whakaaetanga o nga raau taero.**

Kei te whakakaha te kāwanatanga o Airani (Iraki pea te hapa tuhi?) i te whitawhita o te ture pāremata hei whakatika i te āhuatanga e pā ana ki te tarutaru me ngā hāmenetanga tarukino. Ko te tikanga o tēnei, kei te hanga ture kaha ake rātou.
"
He aha te mea i ture mo te wa poto i Ireland?,"The correct answer is **D: Nga raau taero**.

The passage states that the Irish government is strengthening parliamentary law to address a situation. The Minister for Health is concerned about the well-being of people seeking drugs that are still legal and about drug prosecutions resulting from newly approved laws. This all points to the issue being related to drugs.
"
He aha te hunga hara i whakawāteatia?,"The correct answer is **C: Te whakakino**.

The passage states that the man is being investigated for vandalism (""te whakawhiti hē tēnā i te takakino""). The description then details how the vandalism was carried out on the Hollywood sign.
"
"I a ia e huri ana i te tohu, he aha te mea kihai i mahia e te whakapae?","The correct answer is **C: Tūkino ā-tinana** (Physically desecrate).

The text states: ""Kāore i whakakino ā-kikotia te tohu"" which translates to ""The sign was not physically desecrated."" Therefore, physically desecrating the sign is what the suspect *did not* do.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i whakapaea e te kaiako English Karno?","The correct answer is **B: mā te noho ki tētahi ākonga**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Takahi manatārua (Copyright infringement)** - The passage states ""Kua whakapaetia anō ia mō te hara tūkino mana pupuri..."" (He has also been accused of copyright infringement...)
*   **C: Tā ana i ngā pānuitanga kāore i te whakaaetia (Printing unauthorized advertisements)** - The passage states ""Nā Modern Education ia i whakapae ki te tā i ngā pānui rahi ki ngā pahi horekau te whakamana..."" (Modern Education accused him of printing large advertisements on buses without authorization...)
*   **D: Whakamahi ana i te reo noa i te tauaha (Using vulgar language in class)** - The passage states ""...e kīia ana kei te whakaputaina he kangakanga ki te akomanga."" (...it is said that he utters curses in the classroom.)

The passage doesn't directly accuse him of having an inappropriate relationship with a student. A student says he taught ""flirting skills"" and was a ""friendly"" teacher, but this doesn't equate to an accusation of an inappropriate relationship. Therefore, B is the answer.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, kaore nei i taunutia e Rolando Mendoza?","Based on the passage, Rolando Mendoza did *not* taunu (kill/massacre) the Kaiwhakaahua (photographers). The Kaiwhakaahua were let go early. The passage states that the tourists were the ones shot by Mendoza, some were killed, and children were among the hostages. The passage does not state specifically that he killed any police officers, although he was involved in a stand-off.

So the correct answer is:

**D: Kaiwhakaahua**
"
"I runga anō i te haerenga, kāore i whakaūngia ngā taupānga i te wā e tukua wawetia ana?","The correct answer is **C: Nga kaiwhakaahua**.

The passage states: ""Tokoono ngā mauhere hei taumau, kei roto ko ngā tamariki me ngā kaumātua, i wetekina wawetia, ka pērā hoki ngā kaiwhakaahua nō Piripaina.""  This translates to ""Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the photographers from the Philippines.""

The question asks who else was released early along with those on the trip (tourists). Since the photographers were released early, and are not tourists, they are the correct answer.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko wai e kohikohi waitohu ana hei tautoko i te whakamana i te mārena ōrite i Paratira?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā kaiwhakahē (The protesters)**.

The passage states ""Kei te tūmanakohia e ngā kaitautohe te kohi i te pētihana o te 1.2 miriona mokotā hei tuku ki te National Congress..."" which translates to ""The protesters are expected to collect the petition of 1.2 million signatures to submit to the National Congress..."" They are the ones gathering signatures to support their cause, which is implied to be the legalization of same-sex marriage.
"
Ko wai e hoatu ai e ngā kaiwhakatuma ā rātou tono?,"The correct answer is **C: Te Rōpū ā Iwi o Parīhi (The National Congress of Brazil)**.

The passage states: ""Kei te tūmanakohia e ngā kaitautohe te kohi i te pētihana o te 1.2 miriona mokotā hei tuku ki te National Congress hei te Noema."" (The protestors are expected to collect a petition of 1.2 million signatures to submit to the National Congress in November.) This directly indicates that the protestors will give their petition (and therefore their demands) to the National Congress.
"
"E ai ki te kōrero a Armand Versace, he aha te mea i tupu i mua tonu i te tīmata o te mano ki te urupare ki te rangi?","The correct answer is **C: He hau taumaha**

Here's why:

*   The passage says, ""Ka rima meneti i muri i te tīmatanga o te whakaaturanga ka tīmata tētahi hau te pupuhi, ā, kotahi meneti whai muri ake, kua tae atu te hau ki te 70km/h..."" This indicates a strong wind (he hau taumaha) started.
*   Following this, the rain and hail came, causing panic. The question specifically asks what happened right *before* the crowd reacted, and the wind preceded the hail.

Therefore, a strong wind is the event that immediately preceded the crowd's reaction."
"E ai ki a Versace, i te wā i tīmata ai ngā hau kaha rawa?","The correct answer is **A: I ētahi meneti i muri i te tīmatanga o te whakaaturanga**.

The passage states: ""Ka rima meneti i muri i te tīmatanga o te whakaaturanga ka tīmata tētahi hau te pupuhi..."" which translates to ""Five minutes after the show started, a wind began to blow...""
"
"I mua i a Fred, e hia nga tupuhi nui i tuhia ki te rawhiti o te 35°W?","The passage states: ""ko te haumātakataka matua tuatoru anake kua pūrongotia ki te rāwhiti o 35 tākiri ki te Uru"" which translates to ""only the third major hurricane ever reported east of 35 degrees West"".

Since Fred is the third, that means there were two previous hurricanes recorded east of 35°W.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: Rua (Two).
"
"I te wā i tū a Fred i te taha o ngā motu o Cape Verde, he aha te aronga i ahu ai?","The correct answer is **D: Te raki-māraki (Northwest)**

The passage states: ""ā, kei te neke atu ki te raki mā-uru"" which translates to ""and it is moving to the northwest"".
"
Ko wai o enei e whai ake nei he tere ake te tere atu i o mua?,"The passage states that 802.11n has speeds ""much faster"" than its predecessors. Therefore, the correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.
"
He aha te mea e hiahiatia ana kia hototahi ai te 802.11n ki te 802.11b?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngā reo irirangi takirua (Dual radios)**

Here's why:

The passage states that 802.11n is backward compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g *if* the station has dual radios.
"
E hia ngā whakataetae i tae atu ai te toa koura o te Olympics ki ngā kēmu Commonwealth?,"The correct answer is **B: Toru**.

The passage states the athlete won medals at ""ngā tānge e toru ki ngā Commonwealth Games"" which translates to ""three times at the Commonwealth Games"".
"
He aha i kore ai te toa koura o te Olympics e tango rongoā mō tōna mamae?,"The correct answer is **D: Kāore e whakaaetia i ngā kēmu Commonwealth**.

The passage states that he couldn't take the painkillers he needed because they were banned at the Commonwealth Games.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha pea i pōraruraru ai mo te mahi rū?","The correct answer is **A: Te aroaro o nga kapua pōuri (The presence of dark clouds)**.

The passage explicitly states that dark clouds at the base of the mountain may have caused confusion about whether an eruption was actually occurring. The presence of dark clouds has nothing to do with earthquakes but with eruptions.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i te wā i puta ai tētahi huringa wāhanga?","The correct answer is **C: I te 10 o Mati**.

The passage states: ""Nā ngā mahi rū hira i reira i puta mai te panoni wā i tū i te **10 o Māehe** ki te taha raki mā rāwhiti o te tawhā o te tihi o te rangitoto."" (Due to significant seismic activity there, a phase change occurred on **March 10th** northeast of the perimeter of the volcano's summit).
"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki te pūtirotiro marama a Chandrayaan-1 ehara i te pono?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **A: He kaimahi to te kaiāwhiti nāna i whakarewa te rūpahu**.

E ai ki te kōrero, ko Chandrayaan-1 he waka ātea **kore tangata**. Nō reira, e kore e taea e te kaimahi te whakarewa te rūpahu. Ko ngā kōrero B, C, me D he pono katoa e ai ki te kōrero.
"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e whakaahua tika ana i te pūtaiao marama?,"The correct answer is **B: He angitu tana taunga tukinga**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the Moon Impact Probe (MIP) ""angitū te tau iho pātata nei ki te pou tonga o te Marama"", which translates to ""successfully crash-landed near the south pole of the Moon"".
The remaining options are incorrect based on the provided text."
"I runga anō i te whakawhitinga, ko tēhea te mehua parenga ki te mate ka whakatinanatia whakamutunga?","Based on the text, the correct answer is **C: Kano kano encephalitis**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Kua oatitia te tini miriona ipu o te ārai mate encephalitis e te kāwanatanga, hei reira e āwhinatia ngā tari hauora te whakarite mō tērā tau."" This directly mentions that millions of encephalitis vaccines have been ordered.
* The text also mentions: ""...i takaroatia ngā mahere kia tukuna ngā rongoā āraimate ki ngā rohe kua tino pāngia i mua i tēnei tau i runga i te korenga o ngā pūtea me te whakaarotau iti e hāngai ana ki ētahi atu tahumaero."" This shows that although the vaccines should have been distributed earlier, they were delayed because of budget issues and focusing on other diseases.

The other options are not the last measure to be put into action as much as the vaccine is:

*   **A: Pesticides:** While pesticides are mentioned, there's no indication they are the *last* thing being implemented.
*   **B: Ngā hopu Pig (Pig Catching):** This is one of the actions the government took, but not necessarily the one implemented *last*.
*   **D: pihi waeroa (Mosquito nets):** Like pig catching, this is an action taken, but not the last.
"
Me pēhea te whakawhiti o te mate ki te tangata?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Te waeroa** (Mosquito).

The passage states: ""Kei te kawea te tahumaero e te poaka, kātahi ka neke ki te tangata ki te naenae."" This translates to ""The encephalitis is carried by the pig, then moves to humans by the mosquito.""
"
He aha te hua o te rahunga o te rerenga tuarua?,"Based on the provided text:

*   The passage states that the failure of the second clause (""hinganga o te whiunga tuarua"") might lead to ""ka whakatuwhera pea i te kuaha mō ngā civil unions hei te wā e heke mai ana"" (opening the door for future civil unions).
*   It also states that as a result of the procedure ""ka arotakengia anō te HJR-3 e te kāwanatanga ka pōtitia ā muri ake"" (HJR-3 will be reviewed again by the government and voted on in the future).
*   The passage also mentions ""e marohi ana kia whakakore i ngā civil union takatāpui"" (strongly implies the abolition of same-sex civil unions)

Therefore, the best answer is:

*   **B: He mana ā muri ake ki ngā whakakotahitanga ā-iwi ōrite** and **A: He arotakenga wawe o HJR-3**"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i te mukutanga o te rerenga tuarua?","The correct answer is **A: I te wā o te hui ture**.

The passage states: ""I tīningia tēnei huihuinga ture i te whakakorenga o te karawhiunga tuarua e te Whare o Ngā Mema, ā, i pāhingia āhua rite nei e te Henate Mane."" This translates to: ""This legislative session was marked by the rejection of the second penalty by the House of Representatives, and was passed similarly by the Senate on Monday."" This clearly indicates the sentence was removed during the legislative session.
"
"""Ki a wai i puta mai ai ngā """"Panama Papers""""?""","The correct answer is **B: Te pēhi** (The press).

The passage states that the documents were ""hurangia ki te perehi"" (revealed to the press).
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko wai i kī te press Ingarangi e whakahaere ana i te nuinga o ngā kamupene i whakamahia hei huna i te taonga?","The correct answer is **C: Te Pēke Pānui**.

The passage states: ""E mea ana te niupepa o Ingarangi, te Guardian i tutuki ai tēnei āhuatanga nā te mea ko tōna hautoru i roto i te 1200 ngā kamupene i tiakina e Deutsche Bank."" This translates to ""The British newspaper, the Guardian, stated that this situation occurred because one third of the 1200 companies were protected by Deutsche Bank.""
"
Ko tēhea o ngā aitua rererangi e whai ake nei i tino mate?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka hinga te waka rererangi i tōna haerenga ki Aramenia mai i Irana**.

The passage states: ""I tērā marama i kitea e Irāna tana aituā hau takiwā kino rawa mō ngā tini tau i te tukituki a tētahi waka rererangi e haere ana ki Amēnia, me te whakamate i te 168 ki runga."" This indicates that the plane crash en route to Armenia resulted in 168 fatalities, which is the highest number mentioned among the listed accidents.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te take mo te tini o nga aitua rererangi e puta ana i Iran?,"The passage states:

*   Iran's fleet is aging and poorly maintained.
*   International sanctions prevent the purchase of new aircraft.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: He rererangi tawhito o ngā rererangi tūmatanui, hōia hoki (Old aircraft of public and military fleets):** This is mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: Kāore he pūtea e āhei ai te hoko waka rererangi hou (No money to buy new aircraft):** The passage states that sanctions are preventing the purchase of new aircraft, not necessarily that there's no money. While lack of funds could be a factor, the sanctions are the explicit cause mentioned.
*   **C: Ko ngā whiu e ārai ana i ngā hoko waka rererangi hou (Sanctions preventing new aircraft sales):** This is a direct cause stated in the passage.
*   **D: He waka rererangi kore e tiakina (Unmaintained aircraft):** The passage says the fleet is ""pakeke haere e kino ana te tuarā"" which translates to ""aging and poorly maintained.""

Therefore, the option that is **NOT** a reason given in the passage is **B: Kāore he pūtea e āhei ai te hoko waka rererangi hou.** While it could be inferred that Iran might also lack funds, the passage explicitly focuses on the sanctions as the reason they can't buy new planes.

**So the answer is B.**
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i whakaurua ki te pūrongo a te Rōpū Ako mo Iraki?,"The correct answer is **B: He whakapuakanga mā ētahi huringa ka taea te karo i te piki haere o te tutu i Iraki**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the report warns that no single action can prevent the violence. This contradicts option B, which suggests changes *can* prevent escalation.

Let's look at why the other options *are* included in the report:

*   **A: He whakahē i te kaupapahere o nāianei** (A criticism of current policy) - The report encourages a ""new approach"" and focuses on ""all aspects of policy,"" implying a critique of the current situation.
*   **C: Ngā tūtohutanga kia haumaru ai ngā taitapa o Iraki** (Recommendations to secure Iraq's borders) - The report mentions a recommendation to secure Iraq's borders to prevent foreign fighters and re-establish relationships with allies.
*   **D: He inoi mo tētahi whakaaetanga ki a Mātau** (A request for an agreement with Us) - The report begins with a call for a public debate and an agreement with the United States on Middle East policy. ""Mātau"" translates to ""Us"", so this is definitely included in the report."
Ko tehea o ngā mea e whai ake nei kāore i whakatenatenahia e te Rōpū Ako mo Iraki i roto i tana pūrongo?,"Based on the passage provided, the Iraq Study Group *does* recommend:

*   **B: He huringa aronga ināianei tonu** (The report ""whakatenatena hoki i tētahi tirohanga hou"" - encourages a new perspective).
*   **D: Te whakatūnga o tētahi mahi whakawhanaunga hou** (The report starts by calling for ""whakaritenga o tētahi whakaaetanga ki Ngā Whenua Tōpū o Amerika"" - establishment of an agreement with the United States).

The Iraq Study Group *does NOT* recommend:

*   **A: Kia whakapuakina he taurangi kia mutu ai te piki haere o te tutu** (The report mentions it's not possible to guarantee an end to violence with any single action).
*   **C: Te whakamahinga o te taupatupatu tuwhera** (The report calls for ""tautohetohe tūmatawhānui"" - a public debate) but does not mention the 'use of open conflict.')

Therefore, the answer is **C**.
"
"E ai ki te pirihimana, ko wai i whakaarohia hei ringa matau o Provenzano?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

The passage states: ""I kī te pirihimana i a Lo Piccolo te ringa haka i te mea ko ia te ringa katau o Provenzano i Palermo...""
"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i homai i roto i te wāhanga, he aha te take o te matenga o Falcone?","The correct answer is **A: I patua a ia i te wā o te whawhai ā-Anaina**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...i te whakamutu ai i te riri pakanga Riina ki te teiti i whakamate ai i ngā hōia Mafia i a Giovanni Falcone me Paolo Borsellino i te 1992.""

This clearly indicates that Falcone and Borsellino were killed during the Riina ""war"" or conflict. ""Pakanga"" in Māori translates to war or conflict. Therefore ""whawhai ā-Anaina"" is the closest match in meaning from the options provided.

"
Ko tēhea o ngā mea e whai ake nei ehara i te mea he whakamoemiti a Hitoshi Saito?,"The correct answer is **C: E rua nga wā o te toa koura o Orangirangi**.

The passage states that Hitoshi Saito was a two-time Olympic gold medalist. ""Orangirangi"" is not mentioned and seems to be a nonsensical option in this context. The other options are stated or implied:

*   **A: E rua nga wā o te Toa o te Ao (Two-time World Champion)** - This is implied by him being a former World Champion.
*   **B: manukura cCommittee mō te Tōpūtanga o Tiapanī judo Katoa (Chairman of the All Japan Judo Federation training committee)** - This is stated directly in the passage.
*   **D: tohunga Judo (Judo expert/master)** - This is implied by his achievements as a judoka and his role in the All Japan Judo Federation.

Therefore, the only option that is not a true statement about Hitoshi Saito's accomplishments is C."
I pēhea a Iwasaki i āhei ai ki te karo i te whakaari?,"The passage mentions Iwasaki was jilted at a marriage in **Nepal**, and imprisoned in **India**. He was bitten in **Tibet**.

Therefore, the correct answers are B, C, and D.
"
Ko wai i whakaekea a Iwasaki?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngā Pirates** (The Pirates).

The text states ""I pāhua ia e ngā kaiā moana"", which translates to ""He was robbed by pirates"".
"
Nonahea a Alonso i mutu ai tana reihi?,"The correct answer is **C: I muri i te whakamutunga o Schumacher i tōna ake rēhi** (After Schumacher finished his own race).

The text states that Alonso finished the race *after* Michael Schumacher's engine failures caused him to retire. While Alonso *was* leading the race (D), this isn't when he finished. A and B are about other drivers' issues, not Alonso's.
"
He aha te take i mutu wawe ai te whakataetae a Schumacher?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: I ngaro i a ia te mana o tana motokā**, although a more accurate translation would be ""He had engine damage"".
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ma wai te mahi ki te whakatakoto putea mo te hunga mauheretia?","The correct answer is **D: Te komihana o te kōti**

The passage states: ""Ka whakarite kia rere te komihana, ki te āhei, ka whakamana ai i ngā whakapae i tūkuna e te āpiha hopu."" This translates to: ""The commission will arrange to run, if able, and authorize the charges submitted by the arresting officer.""

Therefore, it is the court commissioner's responsibility to authorize the charges, which would effectively set bail.
"
"E ai ki te ture ārai āwhinatanga e whakahuatia ana i roto i te wāhanga, he aha te mea e whakaaetia ana kia mau ki te hunga i hopukina kia roa ake i te 24 haora?","The correct answer is **D: He whakarongo (A hearing)**

Here's why:

The passage states that Judge Glynn issued a ""pupuritanga mauhere mō nāianei"" (temporary detention order) to strengthen the cases of those detained longer than 24 hours after being arrested. It then says that the commission will meet ""ki te āhei, ka whakamana ai i ngā whakapae i tūkuna e te āpiha hopu"" (if possible, to authorize the charges brought by the arresting officer). This indicates that a **hearing** is required to authorize holding someone longer than 24 hours without charges.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea te take kāore i whakamahia hei whakamārama i te whakahaerenga kua whakakorea?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā mōrea haumarutanga (Security risks)**

Here's why:

* **C: Ngā utu tiketike (High costs)**: The passage states that Lodin mentioned canceling the runoff to save Afghans the expenses (""ngā utu"") of another election.
* **B: He whakahēnga mo te kaupapa ture (Constitutional challenge)**: The passage mentions that some reports argue that banning the runoff would violate the legitimacy of the legal process (""he āhuatanga e takahi ana i te mana o te whakaritenga ture""). This implies a potential constitutional challenge.
* **D: Rangirua ā-kaupapa (Conceptual confusion)**: Government intermediaries claimed that the Afghan governance law was too unclear (""pērā rawa te rangirua ki te ture kāwana"") to determine the runoff's validity.

Security risks (""Ngā mōrea haumarutanga"") are not explicitly mentioned as a reason for canceling the runoff in the provided text. Therefore, it is the correct answer.
"
He aha te take i whakaarohia ai e ngā kaitōrangapū kāore he take o te putanga?,"The correct answer is **C: Tērā te rangirua i roto i te kaupapa ture** (There is confusion in the constitution).

The passage states that government intermediaries claimed the Afghan constitution was too unclear to determine if a runoff was necessary.
"
Ko wai e whakarato ana i ngā ratonga whakawa mō FATA?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngā Māngai Tōrangapū**.

The passage states that ""kei te noho haepapa ēnei kaiwhakahaere mō te tuku i ngā ratonga ā-kāwanatanga, ā-kōti anō hoki..."" which translates to ""...these administrators are responsible for providing government and court services..."".  ""Ēnei kaiwhakahaere"" refers to the political agents mentioned earlier in the passage.
"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki “Ngā Māngai Tūturu” a FATA ehara i te tika?,"The correct answer is **B: I tīpakohia rātau e te perehitini o Pakistan**.

The passage states that ""I kopoua he apataki tōrangapū e te perehitini o Pakistan ki te whakahaere i a FATA."" This indicates that the political agent was appointed by the president, not ""tīpakohia"" (chosen) which implies a selection process. The other options are all implied or directly stated in the passage.
"
He aha te tohu i tohua ai a Emma Stone?,"The correct answer is **C: Kaiwhakaari Tino Pai**

The passage states: ""I tohua a Gosling rāua ko Stone hei Best Actor me Best Actress."" which translates to ""Gosling and Stone were nominated for Best Actor and Best Actress.""
"
Ko tehea te tohu kāore i tohua te kiriata?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngā Rākeitanga Arokite Tino Pai**.

The passage lists ""Pikitia Pai, Whakaranu Oro, me Waiata Taketake"" as categories the film was nominated for. Ngā Rākeitanga Arokite Tino Pai (Best Visual Effects) is not mentioned.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei i mahi tonu i muri i te ruu?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is:

**D: He tipu hiko i Niigata**

Here's why:

*   The text states that according to NHK reports, the *wharau hua ruarua* (which is likely referring to a power plant) in Niigata is operating well.
*   The Hokuriku Electric Power Co. reported no impact from the earthquake on their Shika nuclear power plant. However, the reactors (Number 1 and Number 2) at Shika were shut down as a precaution, so they were not operating normally.
*   The Noto Airport is closed, and train services are disrupted.

Therefore, only the power plant in Niigata is explicitly mentioned as operating well after the earthquake."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā mea e whai ake nei i kino i te ruu?","Based on the passage, the correct answers are:

*   **A: Ētahi kāinga** (Some homes - mentioned as 9400 homes without water and nearly 100 without electricity)
*   **C: Ētahi huarahi** (Some roads - mentioned as being damaged)
*   **D: Te Taunga Rererangi o Noto** (Noto Airport - mentioned as being closed)

Option B is incorrect because the passage states the power plant itself was shut down as a precaution, but not damaged."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā take e whai ake nei kāore i whakaurua ki te tuhinga?","The correct answer is **B: Te take o te pakanga o te tau 1967**

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses the borders before the 1967 war, but it doesn't discuss the causes or reasons *for* the 1967 war itself.
*   Options A, C, and D are all explicitly mentioned in the passage."
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te mea e hiahiatia ana e Palestine?,"The correct answer is **D: E rima tau te aroaro o te hōia i te Rawa o Jordan**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the PA (Palestinian Authority) wants a **three-year** presence in the Jordan Valley, not five. Option D is incorrect.
*   The passage states that President desires the borders on the edges prior to 1967 Mideast War. So, option A is correct.
*   The passage states that the nature of Jerusalem going forward is a key topic to be solved. So, option C is correct.
*   The passage states that Israel wants military in Jordan Valley for a decade, and the PA want military presence there. So, option B is correct.
"
I whea whenua i ako ai a Ma i te ture?,"The correct answer is **A: United States of America**.

The passage states that Ma attended Harvard Law School, which is located in the United States. Therefore, Ma studied law in the United States of America.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko te tautoko i tehea whenua i āwhina i te wikitōria o Ma?","The correct answer is **D: Haina**.

The passage states that Ma won ""i runga i te whakaaro hei hāpai ake kia tata ake ngā hononga ki te whenua matua o Hāina"" which translates to ""on the idea of supporting closer ties with the mainland of China"". This means Ma's support for closer ties with China was a key factor in his victory.
"
"E ai ki te kōrero i roto i te wāhanga, ko wai i mahi ai a Carolyn Wilson i mua i tana wehe atu i te taone?","The correct answer is **C: Te OHA**.

The passage states: ""...ka taka te kapa ki te nuinga o ngā whānau e pāngia ana kua tāhae a Carolyn Wilson nō te OHA i ā rātou utu whakahaumaru, me te wehe tonu atu i te tāone."" This clearly indicates that Carolyn Wilson worked for the OHA.
"
"Me ngā iwi e whā e toe ana i te wā, ko wai kai te wāhi tuawhā o te Whakataetae Atekōkiri?","The correct answer is **D: Bowyer**

The passage states: ""Kei te tuatoru a Hamlin, e rua tekau piro ki muri, engari e rima ngā piro ki mua i a Bowyer."" This means Bowyer is right behind Hamlin and therefore in fourth place.
"
"Whai muri i te whakataetae i whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga, e hia ngā tohu a Kahne i te Pirimia Kaiwhakahaere?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The passage states ""Kei te tuarima a Kahne ... me ngā piro e 2,220"". This directly tells us Kahne has 2,220 points.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, e hia nga wā i kite ai te tangata i te takanga o nga matakōkiri e kitea ana he take o te martian ā muri ake?","The correct answer is **B: E rima ngā wā**.

The passage states: ""E whakaponotia ana koinei te wā tuarima i te hītori ko te hunga kua mātakitaki te hunga i te āhua i hua mai ko te matū Matawhero kua whakatūturutia ā-matūtia e tau ana ki te Ao."" This translates to: ""It is believed that this is the fifth time in history that people have observed a meteor that has been materially confirmed to be from Mars falling to Earth.""
"
"Ka rite ki te mea i whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga, he aha te pono o nga toka kua kitea he Martian te takenga mai?","The correct answer is **D: E 34 o rātau** (There are 34 of them).

The passage states: ""Mai i te tata ki te 24,000 matakōkiri e mōhiotia ana kua hinga ki te Ao, tōna 34 anake kua whakatūturutia te ahunga mai i Matawhero."" (From the nearly 24,000 meteorites known to have fallen to Earth, only 34 have been confirmed to originate from Mars.)
"
No hea i haere ai a Schumacher?,"The correct answer is **B: I muri i tana toa whitu o tana whakataetae**.

The passage states that Schumacher retired in 2006 after winning the Formula 1 championship seven times.
"
No hea i whara ai a Massa?,"The correct answer is **A: I te wa o te Grand Prix**

The text states that Massa suffered a ""serious head injury following a crash at the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2009"".
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, me pēhea te pānga o te whakaritenga ki AOL?","The correct answer is **C: Ka whakataetae te maha o ngā kaiwhakamahi o AOL ki ngā kaiwhakamahi o Yahoo me Microsoft** (The number of AOL users will compete with the users of Yahoo and Microsoft).

The passage states that the combined number of Yahoo! and Microsoft users rivals AOL's customer base. This directly implies competition between the number of users each company has.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei ka mutu i muri i te whakaritenga hou?,"The correct answer is **C: Te herekore o AOL ki te whakawhanake i te mākete i tōna ake tere**.

Here's why:

*   The premise (P) states that AOL has been able to develop the IM market at its own pace in the US.
*   It also mentions that a new agreement might remove some of this freedom.
*   The question (Q) asks what will end after a new agreement.

Therefore, the logical conclusion is that the freedom of AOL to develop the market at its own pace will likely end or be significantly impacted by the new agreement.

The other options are not as directly tied to the information in the premise:

*   **A: Te whanaketanga whānui o te Ipurangi i te United States** - The general development of the Internet is a much broader topic and not specifically addressed.
*   **B: Te whakamahinga o te mākete IM** - IM market usage may change due to the new agreement, but the market itself isn't mentioned as going away.
*   **D: Ko te hononga a Yahoo me Microsoft** - The relationship between Yahoo and Microsoft is mentioned only in comparison to AOL's customer base, not as something that will end due to a new agreement."
E hia ngā tāngata i mate i te whakaeke ehara i te pirihimana?,"The correct answer is **C: 0**.

The text states that two police officers died in the attack. The question asks how many non-police officers died, so the answer is zero.
"
Na wai i pūrongo te whakapae i te whakaeke?,"The correct answer is **A: Pirihimana**.

The passage states, ""E whakapae ana ngā pirihimana ko te tangata tūkino he hōia Daesh (ISIL),"" which translates to ""The police suspect the attacker was a Daesh (ISIL) soldier.""
"
"Nā te tūnga o Florida hei kāwanatanga toa-ka tango-katoa, he aha te mea i whakawhiwhia ki a Mitt Romney?","The correct answer is **C: Ngā kaitautapa katoa o te kāwanatanga**.

The passage states ""He roherohenga toa takitahi a Florida, ā, ka whakawhiwhia ngā pōti katoa ki a Romney"". This means that because Florida is a winner-take-all state, Mitt Romney received all of the state's delegates."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te ōrau o ngā pōti i whiwhi a Gingrich i te pōtitanga tuatahi?","The correct answer is **B: 32 ōrau**

The passage states that Newt Gingrich came in second with 32 percent of the vote.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko wai kāore i haere tonu i muri i ngā hua o te hui?","The correct answer is **B: Bachmann**.

The text states: ""I whakatau a Bachmana...ki te whakaoti i tana whawhai"" which means Bachmann decided to end her campaign. The other candidates indicated that they would remain in the race, for now.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, nāna i kōrero nui tētahi atu kaitono i muri i te hua o te kararehe?","The correct answer is **B: Gingrich**.

The passage states: ""ka īnoi a Gingrich ki a Santorum, engari ka whakatāmaramara ki a Romney nā wai ngā mahi whakatairanga hē i tuku kia whakaatuhia ki Iowa mō Gingrich."" This translates to ""Gingrich would congratulate Santorum, but criticize Romney for the negative ads aired in Iowa against Gingrich."" Therefore, Gingrich spoke about another candidate (Romney) after the results.
"
I hea te wāhi anake i whakaatuhia ai te whakaaturanga i mua i te tau 2015?,"The correct answer is **A: Reo Irirangi TogiNet**.

The passage states ""I ōna rā tīmatanga, i whakaaturia anake te hōtaka ki te pae tukutuku reo irirangi ā-ipurangi kua roa e tū ana a TogiNet Radio..."" This clearly indicates that TogiNet Radio was the only place the show was featured in its early days, before 2015.
"
He aha te āhua o te whakaahuatanga a te teihana i te whakaaturanga?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **C: kura tawhito**.

Ko te take i pēnei ai:

*   Ko te kīanga ""whakaari ā-reo irirangi o mua"" e tohu ana ki ngā whakaaturanga reo irirangi mai i ngā wā o mua, nā reira e pā ana ki te āhua ""kura tawhito"".

Ko ētahi atu whiringa kāore i te tika:

*   **A: Amateur** (Tauhou) - Ahakoa i te tuatahi i rongohia ngā reo a te tauhou, kāore e whakaahuatia ana te whakaaturanga tonu pērā.
*   **B: Geeky** (Pakihawa) - Ahakoa e hāngai ana ki ngā kaiwhaiwhai pakihawa, ehara i te tino whakaahuatanga i te whakaaturanga ake.
*   **D: Paetata** (Tata) - Kāore he kī i roto i te kōrero e pā ana ki te wāhitau ā-matawhenua.
"
He aha te mea i kohia e David Headley i āwhina i te whakaeke a te rōpū hōia?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **A: Mōhiohio**.

E ai ki te kōrero, ko tā David Headley mahi pūraohua me te nanao ki ngā kōiriiritanga i āwhina i te whakarite i te mahinga. Ko te tikanga o ""pūraohua"" me ""kōiriiritanga"" he kohikohi mōhiohio. Kāore i kohia e ia ngā pohū, ngā pūtā, ngā rākau aunoa.
"
He aha te momo waka i whakamahia e te rōpū hoariri ki te haere ki Mumbai?,"The correct answer is **C: Waka (Boat)**.

The passage clearly states that the attackers arrived in Mumbai ""mā runga poti"" which translates to ""by boat"".
"
Ko tēhea kōrero e whakaatu tika ana i te putanga o te whakataetae Nadal me Raonic's Brisbane Open i whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga?,"The correct answer is **A: I patua e Raonic a Nadal**.

The passage states, ""Nō nā tata nei ia hinga ai ki a Raonic i te Brisbane Open,"" which translates to ""He recently lost to Raonic at the Brisbane Open"". This means Raonic defeated Nadal.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te tūnga o te whakataetae a Nadal rāua ko Raonic i muri i te tūnga tuatahi?","The correct answer is **D: I patua e Raonic a Nadal**

The passage states: ""Nō nā tata nei ia hinga ai ki a Raonic i te Brisbane Open."" which translates to ""He was recently defeated by Raonic at the Brisbane Open."" This directly indicates that Raonic beat Nadal.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: He 88% ngā tohu pūtea a Raonic** - The passage mentions Nadal winning 88% of the points in the competition.
*   **B: I riro a Nadal i ngā tohu 76** - The passage mentions Nadal winning 76 points in the first serve.
*   **C: Ko te tapeke ko te 7-2** - This refers to the head-to-head record between Nadal and the Canadian opponent in general, not the specific match in question."
Ko tehea te hōtaka reo kāore i whakaurua ki ngā whakaaturanga hou e toru o Naked News?,"The correct answer is **C: Reo Hapanihi**.

The passage states that Naked News already reports in English and Japanese. The new programs will be in Spanish, Italian, and Korean.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, kei whea te wāhi e wātea ai ngā whakaaturanga hou o Naked News?","Based on the passage:

*   ""Kei te whakarewahia e ngā kaiwhakahaere o te ao whānui i ngā kaupapa reo Pāniora, Itāria me Korea hoki mō te **pouaka whakaata, te ipurangi me ngā waea pūkoro**.""

Therefore, the new programs will be available on:

*   Pouaka Whakaata (Pouaka Whakaata)
*   Te Ipurangi (The Internet)
*   Ngā waea pūkoro (Mobile phones)

So the correct answer is a combination of A, B, and D. However, since we need to pick only one option, and the passage specifically lists all three platforms together, the best answer encompassing all is:

*   **B: Te Ipurangi** (The Internet) - as it is a central platform where these videos are likely hosted and then accessible on mobile and sometimes on TV through streaming. Although, the most comprehensive answer would be all three, as the options are presented, the internet is the most suitable."
E hia ngā kaiwhakataetae kāore i oti i te Giant Slalom?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

The passage states: ""45 mai i te 117 kaieke retireti katoa ki te Giant Slalom kāore i whiwhi piro ki te rēhi"" - ""45 out of 117 total skiers in the Giant Slalom did not get a score in the race"".
"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e whakaatu tika ana i ngā hua o ngā whakataetae i ngā whakataetae?,"Let's break down the passage and analyze each option:

*   **Passage Key Points:**
    *   Carpanedo competed in Slalom and Giant Slalom.
    *   Slalom: Did Not Finish (DNF) in the first run. 36/116 skiers DNF.
    *   Giant Slalom: Finished 10th in the women's sitting group with a time of 4:41.20. Was slower than the winner and the 9th place finisher. Four women in the sitting group DNF. 45/117 skiers overall DNF in Giant Slalom.

Now let's examine the options:

*   **A: I te whakataetae tuarua, ka mutu a Carpenado i mua i te kaieke ski mai i Hungary**
    *   The ""second race"" is the Giant Slalom. Carpanedo was slower than Gyongyi Dani from Hungary, who finished 9th, meaning Carpanedo finished *behind* the Hungarian skier. This is incorrect.

*   **B: E 45 nga reti kāore i whakaoti i a rātau whakahaere i roto i te Giant Slalom**
    *   The passage states: ""45 mai i te 117 kaieke retireti katoa ki te Giant Slalom kāore i whiwhi piro ki te rēhi."" This is a correct interpretation of the passage

*   **C: He nui ake ngā reti i oti i te Giant Slalom i te Slalom**
    *   Slalom: 116 total - 36 DNF = 80 finished
    *   Giant Slalom: 117 total - 45 DNF = 72 finished
    *   More skiers finished the Slalom than the Giant Slalom. This is incorrect.

*   **D: I oti i a Carpenado te whakatekau i roto i te Slalom**
    *   The passage states Carpanedo Did Not Finish (DNF) in the Slalom. This is incorrect.

**Therefore, the correct answer is B.**"
Ko tēhea o ēnei mea i whakatauhia e te NBA kia whakamutua?,"The correct answer is **A: Te wā poikohu (The basketball season)**.

The passage states the NBA suspended the basketball season.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te take i āwangawanga ai te NBA mō te huaketo?","The most accurate answer based on the passage is **D: I whakamātauria e tētahi kaitākaro mō te Utah Jazz he pai.**

The passage states the NBA suspended the season ""following a Utah Jazz player testing positive for COVID-19."" This directly supports option D.
"
Ko wai i eke i te whāinga toa mō ngā Washington Capitals i te kēmu ki ngā Atlanta Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **A: Nicklas Backstrom**.

The passage states: ""Ko te āwhina tuatahi a Ovechkin mō te pō ko tana āwhina ki te whai i te piro i toa ai, nā te tore-kai-huruhuru nā Nicklas Backstrom..."" which translates to ""Ovechkin's first assist of the night was on the game-winning goal by Nicklas Backstrom...""
"
Ko wai i eke i tana whāinga 60 o te wā i te wā o Capitals vs. Ko te kēmu o ngā Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

The passage states that Ovechkin scored his 60th goal of the season during the Capitals vs. Thrashers game.
"
Nō whea i hiahiatia ai e te pēke o Northern Rock te tautoko a te kāwanatanga?,"The correct answer is **A: I muri i te whakawāteatanga o te pēke.**

The passage states: ""I hiahia āwhina a Northern Rock i te mea o tana tū marake i te wā o te mōrearea mōkete āpiti i te tau 2007."" This implies they needed government support because of their precarious position during the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis, which led to the government assistance and eventual nationalization in 2008.  None of the other options line up with the timeline presented in the passage.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e whakaahua tika ana i ngā mahi a Virgin Group ki te pēke Northern Rock?","The correct answer is **B: I hokona e te rōpū Virgin Group te pēke i muri i tōna whakaraunga**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Kua hokona e Virgin te """"pēke pai"""" o Northern rock..."". This directly supports the statement that Virgin Group bought a part of the bank (the ""good bank"").
*   The passage also states: ""i whakawehea te pēke huarahi matua o nāianei a Northern Rock plc i te """"pēke kino"""", a Northern Rock (Asset Management)"". This means that Northern Rock was nationalized before being split into the ""good bank"" and the ""bad bank"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I hokona hoki e Virgin Group te kamupene whakahaere rawa o Northern Rock** The passage specifically says Virgin bought the ""good bank"", *not* the asset management company (""bad bank"").
*   **C: I whakawhiwhia e Virgin Group te tautoko ohorere ki te pēke i te wā o te raru nama** The passage explicitly says it was the British Government that gave emergency support.
*   **D: Ko te tono tuatahi a Virgin Group mō te pēke i mahia i muri i te whakakotahitanga o te pēke** The passage says Virgin Group's bid was made *before* the bank was nationalized.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga, he aha te iwi e pāngia ana e te hainatanga o te kirimana āhuarangi o Kyoto?","The correct answer is **C: Ahitereiria**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the decision of then-Prime Minister Rudd to sign the Kyoto Protocol in the US is ironic, as the **US is now the only developed country that hasn't ratified the agreement**.
*   The passage then says the **previous Australian government refused to ratify Kyoto**, claiming it would damage the economy.
*   The passage also mentions India and China as not being bound by emissions targets, but this is related to the *reason* why Australia didn't initially ratify, not who is affected by the current situation.

Therefore, Australia is the most directly affected party as per the passage, due to the context of Rudd's decision."
I whakaaro te kāwanatanga o Australia o mua ka kino te whakaaetanga o Kyoto ki te aha?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngā kawenga ake waro**.

The passage states ""...me te kī ake ka pakaru te ohanga me tana tīno whakawhirinaki ki te kaweake waro..."" which translates to ""...saying it would damage the economy and its heavy reliance on coal exports..."" Coal exports are ""ngā kawenga ake waro""."
He aha te hōtaka i whakawhiwhia ai ngā kaiwhakatū i te ara?,"The correct answer is **A: Ko te kaupapa Sporting Shooters Association o Australia**.

The text states that volunteers were sought under ""te hōtaka aruaru o te Sporting Shooters Association"" which translates to ""the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association"".
"
Ko tēhea kōrero e kore e tika te whakaatu i te whakamātautau whakahaere kino?,"The correct answer is **A: Pērā ki te whakamātautau tuatahi o te papatono, kāore i arotakea** (Like the first trial of the program, it was not evaluated).

The passage states: ""Me āta whakahaere e ngā kaimahi ngahere ngā ringa pū ki te whakamātau tāmi kīrearea tāpiri, **i te aroturukitanga o te whakamātau me te aromātai i tana pai**.""  This clearly says the trial *was* monitored and its effectiveness assessed (aromātai i tana pai). Therefore, option A is incorrect.

The other options are all supported by the passage:

*   **B: I whiwhi tohutohu whakangungu ngā tākaro (The shooters received training instruction):** ""...i whakangungu ngā kaikōpere e whā i tohua ki ngā akoranga whakahaumaru, ngā akoranga hoki e pā ana ki te mau pū.""
*   **C: I whakahaeretia nga pūtiro e nga kaitiaki (The inspections were carried out by the guardians):** ""Me āta whakahaere e ngā kaimahi ngahere ngā ringa pū..."" (Forestry staff carefully managed the firearms...)
*   **D: E whā ngā pūtiro i tīpakohia (Four shooters were selected):** ""...i whakangungu ngā kaikōpere e whā i tohua..."" (the four selected shooters were trained...)"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i kitea te wahi?","The best answer from the provided options is **D: I Etiopia (In Ethiopia)**.

Here's why:

* The passage directly mentions the Rift Valley Research Service in Ethiopia, and that Berhane Asfaw, a co-author of the research, works there. This strongly implies the research, and therefore the discovery, took place in Ethiopia.
* While the Rift Valley is mentioned (A), it's too broad. The passage specifies the Rift Valley Research Service *in Ethiopia*.

The other options are less relevant:

* B: I runga i te anga (On the frame/skeleton) - The passage doesn't mention skeletons or frames directly in relation to the location. It discusses the timing of the ""great split"" being earlier than previously thought based on molecular evidence.
* C: I roto i ngā whakaaturanga rāpoi ngota (In the molecular representations) - This refers to the *evidence* used, not the physical location of the discovery.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea i tupu wawe ake i te mea i whakaarohia?","The correct answer is **A: Te kitenga o te fossil**.

The passage states: ""I te mea o te mātātoka nei e mōhio ai i moata ke noa ake o te wehenga nui, tēnā i tā rātou i whakatau ai mā te kitenga rāpoi ngota."" This translates to: ""The fossil discovery showed that the split was much earlier than they had determined through molecular evidence.""

Therefore, the fossil discovery revealed that the split happened earlier than what was previously thought based on molecular evidence.  This makes A the correct answer. C (Te tātaritanga o ngā whakaaturanga rāpoi ngota - The analysis of molecular evidence) is the opposite, it was the later discovery/estimation.
"
He aha te mea e hiahiatia ana e te kaitākaro kia taea ai e ia te whakahaere i ngā nekehanga i te wā o te kēmu ataata?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **D: Nekehia te pūmana mā te hau**.

Ko te whiti ""Mā tēnei ka taea ngā kaitākaro te nukunuku haere i roto i ō rātou mahi ataata mā te hiki i te taputapu ki te rangi"" e kī mārama ana me nekehia te pūmana (taputapu) mā te hau (hiki ki te rangi) kia taea ai te whakahaere i ngā nekehanga i te wā o te kēmu ataata.
"
He aha te mea i hangaia kia rite ki te taura pouaka whakaata?,"The correct answer is **B: Ko te kaiwhakahaere Nintendo Revolution**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the president of Nintendo revealed ""te hanganga raumamao mō te Nintendo hou raumamao whanaketanga a te kamupene"" which translates to ""the remote design for Nintendo's new developing remote"".
*   The passage goes on to say ""He āhua ōrite te hanga ki tētahi roumamao"" which means ""The design is similar to a remote"".

Therefore, the Nintendo Revolution controller (also known as the Wii Remote) was designed to look similar to a remote control."
He aha te mea kihai i whakaaturia i roto i te pūrongo hou a te tari rongo o Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **B: I tau te waka rererangi ki Ürümqi**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that early reports said the plane was diverted to Afghanistan after being denied an emergency landing in Urumqi. This implies it *didn't* land in Urumqi.
*   The passage says later reports stated the plane received a bomb threat, was diverted to Afghanistan and landed in Kandahar.

Therefore, the one thing that was *not* reported in the later Xinhua report is that the plane landed in Urumqi."
He aha kāore i kōrerotia i roto i te pūrongo tuatahi o te kōwhiringa hou o Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **D: I whiwhi te waka rererangi i tētahi tuma pōma**.

The passage states: ""I ngā ripoata o muri atu i kī ake i tae tētahi whakatuma poma ki te waka rererangi..."" (Later reports said there was a bomb threat to the plane). This means the initial report did **not** mention the bomb threat.
"
He aha te mea i panuitia e Sara Danius i te hōtaka reo irirangi?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka mutu te mahi a te komiti ki te whakapā atu ki a Bob Dylan**.

The passage states that the committee had given up trying to contact Bob Dylan after being unable to reach him.
"
Ko wai kāore i taea te tae atu?,"The correct answer is **D: Bob Dylan**.

The passage states that the Nobel Committee, through Sara Danius, has been unable to contact Bob Dylan directly.
"
"""Ko wai i kōrero mo te taunaha he """"hipanga nui""""?""","The correct answer is **C: Kōnata Johndroe** (Gordon Johndroe). The passage states that Gordon Johndroe, a representative of Bush, said it was an important step.
"
E hia ngā tīkitipati i hangaia e Słania mō ngā whenua rerekē?,"The passage states: ""1,000 ngā pane kuini i hangaia mō Sweeden me ētahi atu whenua e 28 te nui."" This translates to ""1,000 stamps were made for Sweden and 28 other countries.""

Therefore, the answer is **D: Neke atu i te 1,000** (More than 1,000).
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te take o te māturu haere tonu i nga haora o te kura?","The correct answer is **C: Whakanui wera**.

The passage states: ""I te ata o te Wenerei, i te komama tonu ngā putanga kura ko te take pea ko te whakarahi ā-mahana ki roto i te kura."" This directly translates to: ""On Wednesday morning, the leaks from the valves continued, likely due to thermal expansion within the valve.""
"
He aha i tuwhera ai nga whatanga āwhina?,"The correct answer is **B: I puta he mate hiko i muri i te whakamātautau pūnaha**.

The text states: ""Nā te ngoikore o te hiko whai muri i te whakamātau i te pūnaha-ā-ahi, ka huaki ake ngā pēhanga āwhina..."" which translates to ""Due to a power failure after a fire-suppression system test, the relief valves opened...""
"
"I tēnei wā, he pēhea te teitei o te wai i te Ninth Ward?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **C: He hope-teitei**.

Ko te kōrero e kī ana kei te noho te Ninth Ward i raro i te wai he hope te teitei i te ekenga o te maioro oneone tata.
"
"I te wā o te Hurricane Katrina, he aha te mea i puta i te Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **C: E 20 waewae te teitei o nga wai waipuke.**

The passage states: ""Ko te Ninth Ward, i reira i waipuketia tae atu ki te 20 putu te teitei i te wā o Hurricane Katrina..."" which translates to: ""The Ninth Ward, where flooding reached up to 20 feet high during Hurricane Katrina...""
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i whakaūngia e Hamilton?,"The correct answer is **B: Te āheinga ki te kānataraki a ētahi atu tūroro i te huaketo** (The ability of other patients to contract the virus).

Here's why:

*   **P states:** Hamilton confirmed the patient was admitted to Howard University Hospital in stable condition, the patient had traveled to Nigeria where people had died of an Ebola outbreak, and the hospital followed containment procedures.
*   **A: Te wāhi i haere ai te tūroro (The place the patient traveled to):** Confirmed, Nigeria.
*   **B: Te āheinga ki te kānataraki a ētahi atu tūroro i te huaketo (The ability of other patients to contract the virus):** While P mentions isolation procedures to prevent potential contamination, Hamilton never confirms whether or not other patients are able to contract the virus. This is a potential risk, but not something explicitly confirmed by Hamilton.
*   **C: Ahakoa i whaia te kawa tika (Whether the proper protocols were followed):** Confirmed, the hospital followed containment procedures.
*   **D: Te āhua o nāianei o te tūroro (The current condition of the patient):** Confirmed, the patient was in stable condition.

Therefore, the only option not explicitly confirmed by Hamilton is the ability of other patients to contract the virus."
He aha tētahi mea e hiahia ana ngā kaipūtaiao ki te whakaaro?,"The correct answer is **D: He pēhea te hanganga o te Ao**.

The passage P states that scientists are interested in how planets, including Earth, formed, and that meteorites may have played a role. Option D directly addresses the formation of the Earth. The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: No te tūtukitanga o nga kameke ki te Whenua** While meteorites (kameke) impacting Earth is mentioned, the main focus is on *how* this relates to Earth's formation, not simply the fact that they collided.
*   **B: He pēhea te hanga pūmua** While protein formation is mentioned, it's in the context of the origin of life and how meteorites may have contributed to it on early Earth, but not a main focus.
*   **C: He aha te take waro** The passage mentions organic molecules that *can* form proteins, but not explicitly about the reasons for carbon.

"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te tūranga i tākaro ai nga pirihimana paetata i te katinga?","The correct answer is **C: I whakahaua e rātau nga kaieke motokā ki ētahi atu ararere**.

The passage states that 80 police officers were there ""hei tohu i ngā kaitaraiwa waka ki huarahi kē atu,"" which translates to ""to direct drivers to alternative routes."" This aligns perfectly with option C.
"
He aha i pā ki nga tomokanga ngongo i te wā o te katinga?,"The correct answer is **A: I aukatihia rātau**.

The passage states ""I whakamahia ngā taraka parahanga hei aukati i ngā tomokanga pū..."" which translates to ""Dump trucks were used to block the tunnel entrances...""

Therefore, the tunnel entrances were blocked (aukatihia).
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea kihai i puta i mua i te tukinga o te kaituhi e te waka?","The correct answer is **D: I taea e te kaiwhakaahua te tiki pikitia o Bieber** (The photographer was able to take a picture of Bieber).

The passage states:

*   The photographer parked their car on the other side of Sepulveda Boulevard.
*   They tried to take pictures of a police scene.
*   The California Highway Patrol told them to move back twice.

Therefore, options A, B, and C all happened. The passage doesn't state or imply that the photographer successfully took a picture of Bieber; it only mentions the photographer's attempt to photograph a police scene.
"
He aha te kaiwhakaahua e ngana ana ki te mahi i mua i tana pānga ki te waka?,"The correct answer is **B: Tangohia ngā whakaahua o te tūnga pirihimana**.

The passage states: ""Ko te mōhio a te pae tukutuku pūrongo o te wā ā-rēhia a TMZ i tū te waka a te kaiwhakaahua ki tērā atu taha o Sepulveda Boulevard me te ngana ki te mau whakaahua o te wāhi tūnga pirihimana..."" which translates to ""The entertainment news website TMZ reported that the photographer parked his car on the other side of Sepulveda Boulevard and was trying to take pictures of the police station...""
"
Ko tēhea kōrero kāore e whakaahua tika ana i te āhua o te perehitini i muri i te whakamātautau i te pai mō te huaketo?,"The correct answer is **A: Kaore a ia i te pai**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""E ū ana te āhuatanga o te perehitene"" which means ""the state of the president is stable.""
*   It also mentions ""Hāunga te kirkā me te korokoro mamae"" which translates to ""Except for the fever and sore throat.""
*   He states ""he pai tonu au hei whakahaere i aku mahi"" which means ""I am still well enough to manage my work.""

Therefore, it's inaccurate to say he is ""Kaore a ia i te pai"" (not well). The other options (sore throat, stable condition, fever) are all mentioned in the passage."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei mo te perehitini e pono ana?","The correct answer is **A: Kāore i a ia te kirikā**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Hāunga te **kirkā** me te korokoro mamae..."" This translates to ""Besides the **fever** and sore throat..."" So he *does* have a fever.

Let's eliminate the other options:

*   B: ""Ka noho a ia ki te kāinga mo nga wiki maha"" - The passage says he will be home for ""ētahi rā"" (a few days), not weeks.
*   C: ""Kai te tino pai a ia ki te pūkoro"" - The passage states ""he pai tonu au hei whakahaere i aku mahi mā te wāea kōrero wāea."" This translates to ""I am still able to manage my work over the phone."" Nothing indicates he enjoys it.
*   D: ""He tino nui tōna take o te huaketo"" - The passage states ""kua āhua pāngia ia e te mate huaketo"" which translates to ""has tested positive for the virus."" Nothing indicates the case is severe."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i te wā e tūmanako ana kia ngoikore tonu te Huripari o te Huripari o Gonu?","The correct answer is **B: I te takanga o te hau, tata ki te 83 mita ia haora**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Tae mai ki te ata moata i tēnei rā, tata ki te 83 km/h ngā hau, ā, ko te matapae ka ngoikore haere tonu."" This translates to ""By early morning today, the winds were about 83 km/h, and it is predicted to continue to weaken."" So when the wind was at 83 km/h the storm was predicted to weaken."
Pēhea te tere o nga hau i te taumata o te Huripari O te Huripari o Gonu?,"The correct answer is **C: 149 maire ia haora**.

The passage states: ""I tana tihi, i tae te haumātakataka pārū Gonu, (kua ingoatia mō ngā rau niu i te reo o te Maldives) ki ngā hau tūpuhi o te 240 kiromita ia hāora (149 mairo ia hāora).""  This translates to: ""At its peak, Cyclone Gonu (named for the coconut leaves in the Maldivian language) reached hurricane winds of 240 kilometers per hour (149 miles per hour).""
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i whakaarotia he āhuatanga o te tuakana o Karenia?,"The correct answer is **C: He pūtau-maha (It is multicellular)**.

The passage states that Karenia brevis is a ""koiora pūtau-kotahi"" which translates to ""single-celled organism"". Therefore, the opposite of that is multicellular. The other options are all mentioned or implied in the passage as characteristics of Karenia brevis.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore e taea e Karena brevis te mahi?,"The correct answer is **B: Kia tere te whakanui i te tau i raro i ngā āhuatanga katoa**.

Here's why:

*   **P states:** The passage states Karenia brevis blooms when conditions are *favorable*. It suggests that natural properties interact to create ideal conditions for population growth, implying that it cannot rapidly multiply under *all* conditions.

The other options are mentioned in the passage:
*   **A: Monokia ngā io ki te ika:** The passage states Karenia brevis produces a neurotoxin that can kill fish
*   **C: Pā ki te wai:** The passage indicates that the water is contaminated, that is, affected by the brevis Karenia
*   **D: Hanga i tētahi neurotoxin:** The passage explicitly says it produces a neurotoxin."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i puta nā te Āwhā o Felicia?","The correct answer is **D: waipuke tiriti**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""kāore anō te kino me te waipuke kia rīpoatangia"" - meaning damage and flooding have not been reported.
*   The passage mentions ""tāuaua puta noa i te nuinga o ngā motu"" (useful rain throughout much of the islands), ""urutanga ka eke ki te 6.34 īnihi ki Oahu"" (rainfall reached 6.34 inches on Oahu), which align with option A.
*   The passage mentions ""ngā rautupu me te uira auau"" (thunder and frequent lightning), which aligns with options B and C.

Therefore, street flooding (waipuke tiriti) is the only option that wasn't reported to have occurred."
Ko tēhea kōrero mo te Āwhā o Felicia e hē ana?,"The correct answer is **B: I te tuatahi i whakarōpūtia hei pāngarau pāngarau i mua i te huri hei ngaru kāwai 4**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Felicia was *at one point* a Category 4 hurricane (""i tētahi wā he āwhā Category 4""). It does not say it *became* a Category 4 hurricane after being something else. In the absence of further info, it is unknown whether this statement is true or false.

The other options are all explicitly supported by the passage:

*   A: The passage describes the rainfall in Oahu as ""mea pai,"" which means ""good,"" ""useful,"" or ""beneficial"" in this context.
*   C: The passage states the remnants caused rainfall ""puta noa i te nuinga o ngā motu"" - which means that the rainfall occurred ""throughout most of the islands"".
*   D: The passage mentions ""rautupu me te uira auau"" (thunder and frequent lightning) accompanying some of the rainfall."

"
I te wā i puta ai te hinganga?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **C: I mua i te putanga mai o te waka haumaru**.

Ko te kōrero i roto i te P e kī ana i tukituki a Piquet Jr. **i mua tata i te taenga atu o te waka haumaru**.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei i iti iho te wā i whakapono tuatahitia e nga kaipūkaro?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **D: Te kunenga o te momo**.

"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e whakaahua tika ana i a CowParade?,"The correct answer is **D: Ko te takahanga toi tūmatanui nui rawa tēnei i te ao**.

The passage states that CowParade is ""the world’s largest public art event"". The other options are incorrect based on the information provided:

The passage states that some people tried to prevent women from speaking about women's health.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea tinana aorangi te tino pūkaha?","The correct answer is **A: Whenua**.

The passage states: ""Ki tā tātou mōhio, kotahi anake te aorangi he nui ake ngā uekaha i a Titan, ko Papatūānuku tōna ingoa,"" which translates to ""As far as we know, only one planet has more powerful forces than Titan, and that is Earth."" (Papatūānuku is the Māori name for Earth).
"
Kua kitea ngā awa me ngā roto i runga i te wai mārama i runga i tēhea ao?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

The passage states that Titan has liquids on its surface (""He pūataata pērā tonu i te wai...kua āhei koe te kite whakararo ki ngā tokatoka, ngā mea para o raro iho""). It also mentions that only one other planet (Earth) has more surface liquids than Titan.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei kitenga ehara i te hua o te kitenga o te huruhuru?,"The correct answer is **D: E whakapumautia ana he huruhuru te nuinga o nga taikaha.**

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses a specific *tail* with feathers found in amber. It doesn't make a sweeping statement about *most* dinosaurs having feathers.

Let's look at why the other options are correct statements derived from the provided text:

*   **A: Te tae paramu o te kararehe (The plum color of the animal):** The passage mentions the researchers found that the feathers were brown on top and lighter/orange on the bottom. Therefore, inferring the color is a valid result of the discovery. *Note:* Plum color is not correct, but the fact that the color was inferred is.
*   **B: He māramatanga kāore i whakamahia ngā huruhuru i te rerenga (An understanding that the feathers were not used for flight):** The passage explicitly states, ""E ai ki te hanganga o ngā huru kāore i whakamahia kia rere (According to the structure of the feathers, they were not used for flying).""
*   **C: He tirohanga ki te kunenga o te huruhuru (An insight into the evolution of feathers):** The passage directly mentions that the finding helps understand the evolution of bird feathers: ""Mā tēnei kitenga e kite ai te māramatanga ki te kukuwhatanga o ngā raukura manu (This finding will provide insight into the evolution of bird feathers)."""
He aha nga huruhuru dinosaur kāore i a ia?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: He rachis**.

The passage states: ""I te mea kāore ngā huruhuru tainahora i te whanake pai i te tuara, e kī ana ko te rachis, ēngari kāore he āhuatanga kē atu o te huruhuru - ko ngā niwha me ngā barbules..."" This indicates that the dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed rachis. The passage further says that the specimen has the feathers of an adult, and that the lower part is pale.
"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki ZMapp ehara i te mea pono?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka āhei te rongoa i ngā mate o mua engari kāore e ārai i te mate**.

Here's why:

*   **A: He mea hanga mai i nga paturopi** - The passage states ""Kotahi te pāhekoheko paturopi, te ZMapp..."", making this true.
*   **C: I whakamahia hei mana i roto i te whakamātautau PALM** - The passage states ""Ki te whakamātau PALM, ko Zmapp hei pae..."", making this true. ""Pae"" means baseline or standard.
*   **D: E whakaatu ana ngā rangahau he iti iho te painga o te reira i te mea i whakaarohia i te tuatahi** - The passage states ""...nā ngā rangahau ōkawa i whakaatu he iti ake ngā painga i tērā i pīrangitia..."", making this true.

*   **B: Ka āhei te rongoa i ngā mate o mua engari kāore e ārai i te mate** - The passage states ""...karekau he rongoā kua pai te whakaatu kia whakamaimoa i te pokenga kua pā kē."" This means no medication has been proven to cure the infection, which means that it cannot cure pre-existing infections.

Therefore, B is the false statement."
Ko tēhea o ngā tauākī e whai ake nei e whakamārama tika ana i te whakamātautau PALM?,"The correct answer is **C: I whakamahia a ZMapp hei pūtake o te whakamātautau**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ki te whakamātau PALM, ko Zmapp hei pae, arā ka whakamahia e ngā kaipūtaiao hei pūtake, ā, ka whakatairitea ngā maimoatanga hou e toru i tērā."" This translates to ""In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as a benchmark, meaning scientists used it as a base and compared three new treatments to it.""
"
E whakaaro ana ngā kairangahau ko whea te wahi ka tino nui te maramara hou?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā whenua moni iti**.

"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ehara i te tika te kōrero mo nga riwha?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **B: Ko tō rātou aroaro e tohu ana kāore te marama e ngaro i te mahi ā-whenua**

**Whakamārama:**

* **Te P:** E kī ana te P, kua kitea ngā tohu i runga i te marama e tohu ana kei te iti haere te marama, ā, he mahi ā-taiao tēnei. Heoi, e taupatupatu ana tēnei ki te kereme ehara te marama i te mahi ā-whenua.
* **Te Q:** E pātai ana te Q mēnā he tika te kōrero mō ngā riwha.

Ko te whakautu B e whakaatu tika ana i te whakautu ki te pātai a Q. Mēnā he tohu kei runga i te marama e tohu ana i te mahi ā-taiao, ehara i te mea kei te noho noa te marama, ā, kei te ngaro i te mahi ā-whenua.

**He aha i hē ai ētahi atu kōwhiringa:**

* **A: Ko ngā mea i hanga i a rātau i tupu tata nei:** Ahakoa e pā ana pea ki ngā mahi tata nei, kāore tēnei e whakautu tika i te pātai e pā ana ki te tika o te kōrero mō ngā riwha.
* **C: Tērā pea he hua nō te heke iho o te marama:**  Ahakoa e taea e ngā riwha te hāngai ki te heke o te marama, kāore tēnei e whakautu tika i te pātai e pā ana ki te tika o te kōrero e taupatupatu ana ki te mahi ā-whenua.
* **D: Kāore he tokomaha i kitea i runga i te mata o te marama:** Kāore tēnei e pā ana ki te ariā e taupatupatu ana ki te kereme mō te marama ehara he mahi ā-whenua.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te ariā e pā ana ki ngā āhua o te whenua e tohu ana he mahi whenua kei te puta i runga i te marama?","The correct answer is **A: Kei te heke haere te marama** (The moon is shrinking).

The passage states that lobate scarps, found on the moon, are caused by the moon's incredibly slow shrinkage. This shrinking is a geological process, and the presence of these scarps suggests ongoing (or very recent) geological activity.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea e kore e nui ake tae noa ki te whakapae?","The correct answer is **A: Ētahi atu tākupu** (Ētahi atu kōrero).

The passage states: ""Nā te tari karauna, nō rātou te mana mō ngā hāmene katoa, ā, kua kī atu ki te perehi karekau ētahi atu kōrero ka whakahuatia ake kia tae rā anō ki te hāmenetanga."" This directly translates to the Crown Office saying that no further comments will be made until the trial.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te raruraru o nāianei mō ngā hiri?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā āhuatanga o te huarere tino nui**.

The passage states ""hei tāpiritanga ki te tio kino, kua whakararu ngā āhuatanga huarere kino i ngā mahi whakarauora"" which translates to ""in addition to the bad ice, the extreme weather conditions have disrupted recovery efforts.""

While the ice (tio) is also a problem (specifically its size and thickness - B and C), the *question* asks what *current* problem is mentioned *according to the passage*. The passage directly states the *extreme weather conditions* are disrupting recovery efforts, making A the best answer. D (Melting i te hukapapa - Melting ice) is not mentioned in the passage.
"
"I tua atu i te hukapapa, he aha anō te mea e pā ana ki ngā mahi whakaora?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā here rangi (Weather conditions)**.

The passage states ""Hei tāpiritanga ki te tio kino, kua whakararu ngā **āhuatanga huarere kino** i ngā mahi whakarauora."" This translates to ""In addition to the bad ice, **bad weather conditions** have disrupted rescue efforts.""

Therefore, the answer to the question ""I tua atu i te hukapapa, he aha anō te mea e pā ana ki ngā mahi whakaora? (Besides the ice, what else is affecting the rescue efforts?)"" is weather conditions.
"
He aha te whakapono i kore ai a Roberts e whakamana?,"The correct answer is **A: Te tika o te kōrerorero i ngā kēhi**.

The passage states that Roberts was hesitant to express his views on the specifics of cases because he believes it is unethical to discuss the details of cases. This directly implies he did not endorse the right to discuss cases. The passage also mentions his belief in the importance of consistent Supreme Court rulings and the right to privacy. The passage also states that Roberts was hesitant to express his views on the beginning of life.
"
He aha te kaupapa i whakaaro ai a Roberts he kore-pai rawa te kōrero?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngā tauwhāiti o ngā take** (The specifics of the cases).

The passage states that Roberts said ""kāore e matatika ki te kōrero mō ngā āhuatanga o ngā kēhi,"" meaning he felt it was inappropriate to talk about the specifics of cases.
"
Kei whea te rua o ngā hihi marama e whiti ana?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **A: Ki te rangi**.

E ai ki te kōrero, ""E rua ngā raiti kaha kua whakaritea ki te aro atu ki te rangi i roto i te pō.""
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, āhea nga kairangirangi hou e hangaia ana ki te pae?","The correct answer is **D: Kei te haere tonu te hanganga** (The construction is ongoing).

The passage states: ""Kei te haere tonu te hanganga mō ngā whare teitei rawa hou e rima ki te wāhi..."" which translates to ""The construction is ongoing for the five new tallest buildings at the site...""
"
He aha ngā mōhiohio e tohu ana he ana The Seven Sisters?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā rerekētanga pāmahana**.

The passage states: ""Ka whakaatu ngā pikitia hihi pōkākā i ngā pāmahana rerekē i te awatea me te pō e whakaaturia ana he ana pea ērā. He makariri ake i te mata karapoti i te rā, he mahana ake i te pō.""  This directly says that the temperature differences (rerekētanga pāmahana) indicate they might be caves.
"
Me pēhea te kitenga i te whanonga wera o Seven Sisters?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā atahanga pōkākā** (Infrared images).

The passage explicitly states ""Ka whakaatu ngā pikitia hihi pōkākā i ngā pāmahana rerekē i te awatea me te pō e whakaaturia ana he ana pea ērā"" (Infrared images show the different temperatures during the day and night, suggesting they might be caves). This directly answers how the thermal behavior of the Seven Sisters was detected.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea kōrero mo te hunga whakapae ehara i te pono?","The correct answer is **D: Kāore a ia i whara**.

The passage states that the man was injured in the explosion (""i muri i tāna whara i te pahūtanga""). Therefore, the statement ""Kāore a ia i whara"" (He was not injured) is false.
"
He aha ngā mōhiohio e pā ana ki te whakaeke i whakapumautia e ngā mana?,"The correct answer is **B: Te iwi o te hunga whakapae** (The ethnicity of the suspect).

The passage states that the authorities know the suspect is a member of the Uighur ethnic group. It also explicitly states they *don't* know his name (D) and does not mention any information about accomplices (A) or the motive behind the attack (C).
"
Ko tēhea kapa ka tākaro i te tukinga ki Ellis Park?,"The correct answer is **C: Āwherika ki te Tonga me Ahitereiria**.

Kei whea ngā Springboks e tākaro ai i tō rātou tukinga e whai ake nei?,"The correct answer is **C: Johannesburg**.

The text states: ""Ka tū te kēmu whakamutunga o te raupapa ki Ellis Park ki Johannesburg hei tērā wiki, hei reira ngā Springboks e tākaro ki a Ahitereiria.""
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei mea i raru ai te teihana mokowhiti i te wā o te misioni?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Kei te pupuri i tētahi gyroscope**.

The passage states ""I mau te teihana ki tāna i whakapono ai, ahakoa te ngaronga o te mīhini gyroscope ki te teihana wātea..."" which clearly indicates the station was experiencing a loss of a gyroscope. The rest of the passage describes the solutions used to address the problem caused by the gyroscope failure.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te take o te mahi a te teihana mokowā?","The correct answer is **C: Whakaoti ana i tētahi haerenga mokowā (Completing a spacewalk)**.

The passage states ""I mau te teihana ki tāna i whakapono ai, ahakoa te ngaronga o te mīhini gyroscope ki te teihana wātea, ki te mutunga rā anō o te hīkoi."" which translates to ""The station stuck to what it believed, despite the loss of the gyroscope machine to the space station, until the very end of the walk."". This directly implies that the station's activity was focused on completing the spacewalk despite the gyroscope issue.
"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki te take ehara i te mea pono?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **B: I whakaritea he whakapae**.

Ahakoa e whakaatu ana te kōrero i timata te AOL i ngā panoni me te whakahaeretia te kēhi i Virginia nā te mea ko reira te kāinga o te kaituku ratonga ipurangi matua a AOL, kāore e kīia ana i whakaritea he whakapae. E kī ana te kōrero i tau he hāmene (a lawsuit) ki te mahinga o te ture, ehara i te whakapae (an indictment).
"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e tino tika ana te whakaahua?,"The correct answer is **D: I tīmataria e AOL te mahinga o te kēhi**.

The passage states ""nā te mea koirā te kāinga ki te kaituku ratonga ipurangi matua a AOL, arā ko te kamupene nā rātou ngā panoni i tīmata."" This directly translates to ""because that's the home of the main internet service provider AOL, that is, the company that started the changes."" This confirms that AOL initiated the case.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I whakahikotia a AOL ki te tuari kāore i te mōhiotia** - The passage doesn't state this.
*   **B: I pā te take ki ngā kaiwhakarato ratonga ipurangi nui e rua** - The passage only mentions AOL.
*   **C: I whiua te kēhi i te tau 2003** - The passage mentions that the law was created in 2003, but it doesn't say the case was ruled on that year."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea karapu i tīmata ai a Vidal ki te tākaro mo te toru wā ki mua?","The correct answer is **A: Sevilla**.

"
He aha a Jarque i noho ai ki te hotera?,"The correct answer is **C: He ōrite tōna i te Rātapu**.

The passage states that Jarque was at the team hotel ""i mua i te tukinga i whakaritea mō te Rātapu ki a Bolonia"" which translates to ""before a match scheduled for Sunday against Bologna"". This directly implies he was at the hotel for the match on Sunday.
"
He aha e kore ai e tukuna he whakatūpato e te pokapū ā-whenua o Jakarta?,"The correct answer is **D: Kāore i tutuki i a ia ngā whakaritenga nui mō ngā rū**.

The passage states that the earthquake didn't reach the required magnitude of 6.5, which is why a tsunami warning wasn't issued. This directly relates to the option D.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te take o te rū?","The correct answer is **B: He tuma tsunami**.

The passage explicitly states that the residents were worried and began to leave their businesses and homes despite the lack of a tsunami warning. This indicates that the earthquake was perceived as a potential threat of a tsunami. The other options are incorrect based on the information provided in the passage.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e akiaki ana i te mahi a te Rā me ētahi atu whetū katoa?,"Based on the provided passage (P), the best answer is **B: Tau Rossby, hurihanga, me te hurihanga aukume**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the ""kanapā me te huringa"" are used to determine the Rossby number (""tau Rossby"").
*   It also indicates that the Rossby number is related to differential rotation (""rere wētoto"") and the strength of a star's ability to generate magnetic fields (""hurihanga aukume"").

Therefore, Rossby number, rotation, and magnetic field generation are all interconnected factors influencing stellar activity."
Me pēhea te whakatau i tētahi tau Rossby whetū?,"The correct answer is **A: Te marama me te hurihanga** (Brightness and rotation).

The text states: ""Kei te whakamahia tahitia te kanapā me te huringa hei whakatau i te tau Rossby..."" which translates to ""Brightness and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number...""
"
He aha te ōrau o ngā tāngata i tirotirohia e tautoko ana kia tū wawe a Ahitereiria hei kāwanatanga?,"The correct answer is **B: 29 ōrau**

The text states: ""Ko ngā tonu nui o te pōti, 29 paeheneti e mea ana me wawe tonu te tū a Ahitereiria i runga i tōna ake mana motuhake..."" This translates to ""The key findings of the poll, 29 percent say that Australia should become independent immediately..."".
"
"E ai ki a Julie Gillard, āhea ka riro ai a Ahitereiria hei kāwanatanga?","The correct answer is **B: I muri i te kingitanga o Kuini Elizabeth II**.

The passage states ""I whakapono a Pirimia Julia Gillard nōnā e whakarite ana mō te pōtitanga whānui kia noho a Ahitereiria i runga i tōna ake mana motuhake whai muri mai i te matenga o Kuini Irihāpeti II.""

"

"
Ko Cliff Stearns te māhunga o tēhea komiti?,"The correct answer is **D: Te āhua o te nui me ngā tūhuratanga**.

The text states: ""kei tāna tūranga hei heamana o te Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, kei raro tērā i te tuanui o te House Energy and Commerce Committee.""  ""Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee"" translates to ""Te āhua o te nui me ngā tūhuratanga"".
"

"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, nāna i tuku whakapae e pā ana ki ngā tuhinga ngaro?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā tangata whenua o te rohe (Local residents)**

The passage states that the issue started with ""ngā amuamu a te marea ki te Tari Poutāpeta ki Obanazawa kāore i rito mai ā rātou kāri mō te tau hou"" which translates to ""public complaints to the Obanazawa Post Office that they hadn't received their New Year's cards."" Therefore, the local residents were the ones who initially complained.
"
I te wā e hiahia ana a Del Potro ki te whakatutuki i tana raruraru pokohiwi?,"The correct answer is C: I te wā o te huinga tuarua.

Here's why:

*   The governor specifically says, """"He take nui tēnei. Kauka e māharahara, e haere pai ana te pūnaha ki tāna e āhei ai""""."" He is assuring the public that despite it being a major issue, the system is functioning as well as it can. ""Kauka e māharahara"" means 'Do not worry', implying he wants them to feel that it is not as serious as they might think.

The other options are true statements from the passage, but they don't directly explain why he's trying to reassure the public.
"
Ko tēhea puna kōrero parody i hangaia e ngā ākonga o mua o te UW?,"The correct answer is **D: Te Aniani**

The passage states ""I mua noa atu i te whakaaturanga The Daily Show, The Colbert Report hoki, ko te whakakitenga a Heck me Johnson he whakaputanga pukuhohe e whakatoi ana ki ngā karere- me ngā mahi kawe pūrongo- i te wā e tauira tonu ana rāua ki UW i te tau 1988. Mai i tana orokohanga mai kua noho te aniana hei rangatiratanga pono o te emapaia parody..."" This clearly identifies Te Aniani as the parody news publication created by former UW students.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i roto i te rangatiratanga o te rongo o Onion?","The correct answer is **B: He pikitia** (A picture).

The passage mentions:

*   **A: He atlas o te ao** (An atlas of the world) - ""ngā pakihere me ngā atlas o te ao e kī nei tō tātou ao koretake""
*   **C: He paetukutuku** (A website) - ""he paetukutuku i tō mai i ngā tūruhi 5,000,000 i te marama o Oketopa""
*   **D: He putanga tā** (A print edition) - ""te tuhinga tārua""

The passage doesn't mention pikitia."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea i tiakina e nga pirihimana?","The correct answer is **C: Te tomokanga o te Tiriti Whakararo (The entrance of Downing Street)**.

The passage states: ""I tīmata te porotēhi i te 11:00 wā takiwā (UTC+1) ki Whitehall, kei tua atu i te tomokanga e hēteritia ana e te pirihimana ki te tiriti o Downing..."" which translates to ""The protest started around 11:00 (UTC+1) in Whitehall, just beyond the entrance guarded by the police to Downing Street...""
"
I te āhea te wā i tono ai te pirihimana kia neke atu ngā kaiwhawhai kia kore ai e nui ake te waka?,"The passage states: ""I te 11.20 i pātaingia e ngā pirihimana ngā kaiporotēhi kia hoki atu ki te ara paparaima, me te whakatau iho kia tika te tauritenga o te porotēhi ki te tini o ngā waka e whakatōpu ana.""

This translates to: ""At 11.20 the police requested the protesters to return to the pavement, deciding that the protest should be in proportion to the number of vehicles gathering.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: I te 11:20**.
"
He aha te pono mo te rangahau i mahia e Dr. Ehud Ur?,"The correct answer is **B: Kua kore ētahi kiore huka i mua i te huka**.

Here's why:

* **P: """"""Kei a tātou ināianei ngā kiore e 4-marama te pakeke kāore i te pāngia e te mate huka, ahakoa i mua i pāngia e te mate huka,""""** directly translates to ""We now have 4-month-old mice that are not diabetic, even though they were previously diabetic."" This confirms that some mice that were diabetic are no longer diabetic.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tērā pea ka whai painga ngā hua ki ngā tūroro whai mate huka Momo 1 tīariari** - Dr. Ur is cautious about the research and specifically says the findings may not apply to those who already have type 1 diabetes.
* **C: E tūmanako ana a ia ka āhei nga kitenga ki te rongoā** - While he's involved in research, the text emphasizes his hesitancy about finding a cure. He is not necessarily confident that the findings will lead to a cure.
* **D: Ināianei he huka ētahi kiore kāore i te huka** - The opposite of what the text says.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha a Dr. to whakaaro tika?","The correct answer is **C: Ko nga whakaaro o ētahi atu tohunga e pā ana ki te rongoā**.

The text states that Dr. Ur, like other experts, is skeptical about a cure for diabetes.
"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei kāore e whakaahua tika ana i te hinganga o te rerenga CG4684?,"The correct answer is **C: E toru ngā ngana o te waka rererangi ki te tau iho i mua i te hinganga.**

The passage states that the plane attempted to land twice. The first attempt was aborted. The second attempt ended in the crash. Therefore, it only attempted to land twice, not three times. The other options are supported by the passage.
"
He aha te take i haukotia ai e Flight CG4684 tōna tauranga?,"The correct answer is **D: He rawakore nga āhuatanga o te huarere**.

The passage states that the Twin Otter cancelled its first landing attempt and the search was hampered by bad weather. This implies that poor weather conditions were a factor in the initial aborted landing.
"
"I runga anō i te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki te wheako o Franciszek Kowal?","The correct answer is **A: I taea e ia te wawahi i tētahi matapihi**.

The passage states: ""Kātahi anō ka pakaru tētahi o ngā matapihi, ā, kā tīmata rātou te puta atu mā te matapihi,"" te kōrero a te morehu a Franciszek Kowal."" This implies that Franciszek Kowal witnessed or was part of the group that eventually broke a window, allowing them to escape. The passage does not say he was injured, or that a chair broke, or that he was no longer known.
"
He aha i uaua ai te whakatau i te pānga o te Huringa Tropical Danielle?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **C: Kai tawhiti atu te āwhā i te whenua.**

E ai ki te kōrero, ""I te mea he tawhiti te whaititiri i te horonga whenua, ka uaua rā te aromatawai i ngā pānga ki te United States ki Caribbean rānei."" Nō reira, te take i uaua ai te whakatau i te pānga, nā te mea kei tawhiti te āwhā i te whenua.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki te Hurricane Danielle he teka?","The correct answer is **D: E tata ana ki te whenua**.

The passage states that the hurricane is far from land (""he tawhiti te whaititiri i te horonga whenua""). Therefore, statement D is false. All the other statements are supported by the information in the passage.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea e whakahuatia ana me pā ki te mate i mua i te take o te urutā huri noa?","The correct answer is **B: Me noho māmā tonu ngā tohu (The symptoms need to remain mild).**

The passage states: ""Ko ētahi tirohanga e mea ana ka āhua maninohea noa te pā o te tahumaero i mua i te hōrapatanga urutā... He āwangawanga kei poke tonu ngā tūroro i te nui atu o ngā tāngata mā te mahi i ā rātou mahi o ia rā ki te noho māmā tonu ngā tohumate rewharewha.""

This translates to: ""Some observations suggest the disease might be relatively mild before a pandemic spreads... There's concern that patients will continue to infect more people while going about their daily activities as the flu symptoms remain mild.""

This directly supports option B, as it highlights the concern about mild symptoms leading to further spread.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he pēhea te tawhiti atu i Fujian te āwhā?","The correct answer is **C: 70 mita**

The passage states: ""I te pō o te 9 o Akuhata whitu tekau kiromita te tawhiti o te karu o Morakot i te rohe o Fujian"" which translates to ""On the night of August 9th, the eye of Morakot was seventy kilometers away from the Fujian region"".
"
Ko wai i mihi ki a Hōri W. Bush i tōna taenga atu ki Āhia?,"The correct answer is **D: Te Pirimia Tuarua** (The Deputy Prime Minister).

While Lee Hsien Loong (the Prime Minister) discussed trade with Bush, the text specifically states that Wong Kan Seng (the Deputy Prime Minister) greeted Bush upon his arrival.
"
I te wā i kōrero ai te peresideni mō te whakawhānui hokohoko o Āhia?,"The correct answer is **C: I muri i ōna hinganga pōti waenganui (After his midterm election losses)**.

The passage states, ""Whai muri i te kotahi wiki o ngā hinganga ki te kōwhiringa pōti waenga wā, nā Bush i whaki atu ki tētahi minenga mō te whakawhānuitanga o te hokohoko ki Āhia."" This translates to ""Following a week of losses in the midterm elections, Bush addressed an audience about expanding trade with Asia.""
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei te whāinga katoa a te kāwanatanga?","Based on the provided statement, the correct answer is **C: Acquire ētahi atu pānga e 1,300.**

The statement says that the government is extending its obligation to fund affiliated colleges, adding 300 to bring the total number of charters (pānga) to 1,300. This means the goal is to reach 1,300 pānga.
"
He aha te whakapuaki a te kāwanatanga?,"The correct answer is **A: E whakaaro ana rātau ki te whakarato i ētahi atu pānga e 300**.

**Explanation:**

The passage states: ""He tāpiritanga 300 e kapi katoa ai ngā hariata ki te 1,3000 e manawatā anō ai i te tini tāngata."" This translates to ""An addition of 300 covering all charters to 1,3000 continues to concern many people.""

*   **A: E whakaaro ana rātau ki te whakarato i ētahi atu pānga e 300** (They are planning to provide an additional 300 stakes) - This aligns with the information provided in the passage about the addition of 300.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: E whakaū ana rātau ki te whakawhirinaki i te raruraru pā** (They are committed to trusting the fence problem) - This doesn't relate to the provided information.
*   **C: E whakaaro ana rātau ki te whakarato i ētahi atu pānga e 1,300** (They are planning to provide an additional 1,300 stakes) - While the total number is 1,300, the addition is only 300.
*   **D: Ka whakaotitia te raruraru nui rawa atu i a Poutāpeta** (The biggest problem at Poutāpeta will be solved) - This isn't mentioned or implied in the passage."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha ngā mōhiohio e mōhiotia ana?","The correct answer is **A: Kua whakahekea te taumata tuma** (The threat level has been reduced).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kāore he mōhiohio hei marohi kei te tataritia tonutia tētahi ekenga. Heoi anō, kāore te hekenga iho o te taumata mōrearea ki te kino e kī ana kua ngaro te mōrearea whānui.""

This translates to: ""...there is no firm information that an attack is being planned. However, the reduction of the threat level to low does not mean the overall threat has disappeared.""

This directly indicates that the threat level has been reduced (hekenga iho o te taumata mōrearea ki te kino). The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kua kore he tuma** (There is no threat): The passage explicitly states the overall threat has not disappeared.
*   **C: E tūmanakohia ana he whakaeke** (An attack is expected): The passage states there is no firm information an attack is being planned.
*   **D: Kua whakapumautia e te Rongoā ka kaha te whakaeke** (The Remedy has confirmed there will be a strong attack): This is nowhere to be found in the passage."
Ko tehea o ngā kōrero e pā ana ki ngā whakaeke ehara i te mea pono?,"The passage states that ""Ko te kōmihana he whakautu nā Martelly mō te horapatanga o te porotēhi ātete kāwanatanga i tīmata i te Oketopa."" This translates to ""The commission was a response by Martelly to the spread of anti-government protests that started in October."" Therefore, option A, ""Ko te komihana a te perehitini he urupare ki nga amuamu"" (""The presidential commission was a response to the complaints"") is a correct reflection of the passage.

The passage also says ""I tīmata ngā tautohe he whakarekereke i ētahi wā"" which means that ""The protests were sometimes violent,"" making option D (""I ētahi wā he pākaha nga whakahē"" / ""The protests were sometimes violent"") true as well.

The passage mentions ""te rihainatanga o te CEP o mua hei wāhanga o tētahi kete kaupapa hei whakaneke i te whenua ki ngā pōti hou."" (""the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package to move the country to new elections."") This means that the resignation of the CEP was part of a *solution* suggested by the commission, not a *demand* of the protesters. Therefore, option C (""I tonoa e nga whakahē te tukunga iho o te CEP o mua"" / ""The protestors demanded the resignation of the previous CEP"") is the untrue statement.

The passage also explicitly states ""I tīmata ngā tautohe...i runga i te kore tū mai o ngā pōtitanga"" (""The protests started...because the elections did not occur""), so option B (""Ko ngā pōti kua whakamutua i whakaoho i ngā amuamu"" / ""The cancelled elections sparked the complaints"") is also true.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C**.
"
Na wai i whakaaro kia whakarere te CEP whakamutunga?,"The correct answer is **C: Ko te Komihana Perehitini**.

The text states: ""I tērā marama i tautuhia e tētahi komihana perehitene te rihainatanga o te CEP o mua hei wāhanga o tētahi kete kaupapa..."" which translates to ""Last month a presidential commission identified the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures...""
"
"E ai ki te kōrero, he aha te mea e kore e tautokohia e te USA Gymnastics i muri i te tukino a Nassar ki ngā kaitākaro?","The correct answer is **A: Whakakoretanga**.

The passage states: ""Kei te whakaae mātou ki te tauākī a te USOC ko ngā pānga o ā mātou kaioma, karapū hoki, tae atu ki tā rātou momo hākinakina, ka pai ake te tautoko i a rātou mā te koke whakamua ki te panoni whai tikanga ki roto tonu i tō tātou whakahaere, **kaua ko te whakakore tiwhikete**.""  This directly translates to: ""...the interests of our athletes, clubs, and the sport, would be better supported by moving forward with meaningful change within our organization, **rather than decertification.**""

The other options are things USA Gymnastics *does* support:

*   **B: Te hanga i tētahi taiao whai mana** (Creating a safe environment) - stated at the beginning of the passage.
*   **C: Ngā huringa e hiahiatia ana i roto i te whakahaere** (The necessary changes in the organization) - mentioned as the preferred alternative to decertification.
*   **D: He tūhura takitahi** (An independent investigation) - supported by USA Gymnastics to address the handling of the Nassar abuse."
"E ai ki te kōrero, he aha te whāinga matua o te USA Gymnastics me te United States Olympic Committee e haere whakamua ana?","The correct answer is **D: Whakatoko ana i tētahi taiao haumaru mō ngā kaipūkaro**.

The passage explicitly states: ""He ōrite nei tā USA Gymnastics me tā USOC whāinga - i runga i tēnā kia āta manaakitia te hākinakina takahurihuri kia taea ai e ngā kaiaka te whai i ā rātou whāinga i roto i tētahi taiao manaaki me te tiaki."" This translates to ""USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal - to ensure that gymnastics is carefully managed so that athletes can pursue their goals in a supportive and protective environment.""
"
I haere te kaipuke ki hea i te wā i puta ai te aitua? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palawan**.

The text states the ship ""was traveling to Puerto Princesa in Palawan."" Therefore, Palawan is the destination it was headed to when the incident occurred.
"
He aha te mea ehara i te mea pono mo te kaipuke e whakahuatia ana i te wāhanga nei?,"The correct answer is **C: He kaipuke ātete tēnei**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the ship is a ""kaipuke whakakore maina rōpū Avenger,"" which translates to ""Avenger-class mine countermeasures ship"". Mine countermeasures ships clear mines, they aren't necessarily designed to be ""resistant"" (ātete). All other options are mentioned directly in the text."
Ko wai i tuku i te kōrero e pā ana ki nga hoia o Amerika?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**.

The passage states ""I te mutunga o te Rātapu, i roto i tētahi tauāki nā te Perehitene o Amerika nā Donald Trump i te heketeri o ngā perehi, i kī ai ka wehe ngā hōia Amerika i a Syria."" This directly says that Donald Trump made the announcement.
"
"E ai ki te whakapuakitanga, ko tehea whenua i whakawhiwhia ki te kaitiaki i nga kaiwhawhai herehere?","The correct answer is **D: Turkey**.

The passage states: ""Ka whai mana hoki a Tākei mō te tiaki i ngā kaiwhawhai ISIS kua mauheretia"" which translates to ""Turkey will also have responsibility for taking care of the ISIS fighters who have been captured.""
"
He aha te mea e whakapono ana ko te take o te hinga?,"The correct answer is **B: Te ahi kaihautū** (Friendly fire).

The passage states: ""i te tihi rā anō o te whenua maunga nei te wāhi i tūtukingia ai, ā, e whakaponotia ana nā te pū taraweti i pēnei ai."" This translates to: ""the site was hit high in the mountainous region, and it is believed that it was caused by friendly fire.""
"
He aha te āhua o te whenua i puta ai te hinganga?,"Based on the provided text (P), the correct answer is:

*   **D: Maunga** (Mountain)

The text states ""I te tihi rā anō o te whenua **maunga** nei te wāhi i tūtukingia ai..."" which directly translates to ""The place where the incident occurred was at the peak of this **mountainous** land...""."
He aha ngā tūmanako a ngā mana whakahaere nā te waipuke?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Te whakaoratanga o ngā pae kirikiri (The restoration of gravel bars)**

The passage states: ""Ahakoa ka piki te taumata o te wai mā ngā putu ruarua ā muri i te waipuke, kei te tūmanako ngā āpiha ka rawaka kia whakahaumanu i ngā pae oneone ngāhorohoro ki raro iho."" This translates to: ""Although the water level will rise through small releases after the flood, officials hope it will be enough to rehabilitate the eroded gravel bars downstream.""
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei i pā pūmau tonu te hanganga o te matatara?,"Based on the provided text, the best answer is **B: Humpback chubs**.

Here's why:

*   The text specifically mentions that humpback chubs are ""tīno mōrearea"" (critically endangered) as a result of the dam's construction. This directly and negatively impacts their population.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Pae kirikiri (Gravel bars):** The passage mentions that officials hope that controlled water releases will be enough to replenish eroded gravel bars. The text doesn't explicitly state that the building of the dam permanently and negatively affected the gravel bars.
*   **C: Ngā wāhi noho o te araora (Wildlife habitats):** The passage mentions that the sandbars and coastlines created by periodic flooding served as habitat for wildlife. Since the dam has stopped periodic flooding, the habitats are affected. However, it isn't explicit as **B**.
*   **D: Kua horahia te Sediment (Sediment distribution):** The text says that the dam has eliminated periodic flooding, which has stopped the replenishment of gravel bars.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, nāna i hoatu te āhua o Te Hononga o Amerika mo nga haerengatērā pea?","The correct answer is **C: He pūtake kāore anō kia herea.**

The passage states: ""E ai ki Ngā Whenua Tōpū o Amerika kua whai mōhiohio ia i tētahi puna kāore i te whakaaturia..."" which translates to ""According to the United States of America, they have received information from a source that has not been revealed...""

Therefore, the source of the information is an **unnamed source**.
"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e whakamārama tika ana i te mahere whakaeke a nga kaiwhakarua?,"The correct answer is **C: Whakapakūtia ngā pomu i ngā rohe i ngā whenua e rua**.

The passage states that the militants are planning suicide bombings against ""key landmarks"" in both Kenya and Ethiopia. This means the attacks are planned for multiple locations (regions) across two countries.
"
Ko tēhea o ngā tāngata e whai ake nei ehara i te rōia?,"The correct answer is **D: Makis Triantafylopoulos**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Makis Triantafylopoulos is a **kairīpoata** (reporter).
*   The passage mentions Sakis Kechagioglou and George Nikolakopoulos are **ngā rōia rongonui Kariki** (famous Greek lawyers).
*   The passage mentions Petros Mantouvalos is a **mema Pāremata me te rōia** (Member of Parliament and a lawyer).
"
Ko tehea rōpū tāngata e kore e whakahuatia hei wāhanga o te aitua i roto i te hapori ture Kariki?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngā Kaipānui** (Readers).

The passage mentions lawyers (ngā rōia), judges (kaiwhakawā/tiati), and specifically names lawyers as being involved in the scandal. Readers are not mentioned.
"
E hia nga paepae i ngaro i Īnia?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**

The passage states: ""whai muri i te ngaronga o tā te kāpene wīkiti i riro noa i a Īnia te 36 omanga me te hinganga o te 7 wīkiti hei whakaoti i te huinga"" which translates to ""after the captain's wicket was lost, India only scored 36 runs and lost 7 wickets to finish the innings.""
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te tapeke teitei rawa o nga wāhanga?","The correct answer is **A: 70 ngā whakahaere** (70 runs).

The passage states that Robin Uthappa scored the highest of the innings, 70 runs off just 41 balls. Therefore, 70 runs is the highest score mentioned in the passage.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei ehara i te take o te āhua o Arama Cuerden?,"The answer is **A: Te kaupapahere hōu a te pae e pā ana ki ngā ihirangi tōkai**.

Here's why:

*   **B: Muku toi o Weera (Wales's art deletion):** Cuerden explicitly mentions the deletion of Wales's art as a source of his frustration.
*   **C: Kāore i te whakarongotia e Weera (Wales not listening):** Cuerden feels Wales wasn't listening to them.
*   **D: Lies mō te take o te muku toi (Lies about the reason for the art deletion):** Cuerden accuses Wales of lying about the legal reason for the deletions.

The passage states the policy about graphic content is a result of the situation, not the cause of Cuerden's frustration."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha i mukua mai i te pae?","The correct answer is **A: Toi**.

The passage states that Adam Cuerden said Wales even went so far as to have his *toi* (art) removed.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tēhea o ēnei e kore e tautokohia e Amir Khan?","Based on the passage, Amir Khan does not support:

*   **A: Tae atu ki nga kairiri wāhine i te nga Orimipia** (Including female boxers in the Olympics)

His quote clearly states he doesn't believe women should fight. The other options are either supported by him (British contenders) or not mentioned in the passage.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tēhea o ēnei e tautokohia ana e Amir Khan ahakoa tōna whakaaro whaiaro?","The correct answer is **C: Ko ngā Orimipia 2012**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Amir Khan, despite his personal belief that women shouldn't box, said he would support British competitors in the 2012 Olympics held in London.
* Therefore, he supports the 2012 Olympics."
No hea i mate ai a Pita Lenz?,"The correct answer is **C: I te hōhipera**.

The passage states: ""i kawea atu ki tētahi hōhipera ki te rohe rā, ā, nāwai rā ka mate ia ki reira."" (He was taken to a local hospital, and he died there.)
"
Ko wai a Xavier Zaira?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **B: Tētahi atu tauomaoma**.

E ai ki te kōrero, i tukituki a Xavier Zayat ki a Pita Lenz i muri i tana hinganga i runga i tana pahikara i te wā o te huringa whakamahana. Ko te tikanga, he tauomaoma hoki a Zayat.
"
I roto i tehea āhuatanga ka whai hua ai te kaihaerere e manukanuka ana ki te mōhio ki te mahi o roto o te waka rererangi?,"The correct answer is **B: Mēnā he wehi ki te kore e mōhiotia te mea e kore ai rātou e pai ki te rere**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that understanding aspects of how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help combat fear stemming from the unknown or a lack of control. This directly aligns with option B.
* Option A is incorrect. The text only mentions that people shouldn't be ashamed of their fears, but the text does not suggest being ashamed to be a reason for knowing how an airplane works.
* Option C is incorrect because the paragraph focuses specifically on the fear of flying, not a general dislike of all travel.
* Option D is incorrect. While the passage acknowledges negative experiences can contribute to fear, the primary focus of the proposed solution is addressing fear rooted in the unknown aspects of flying."
"I runga anō i te haerenga, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei me mahi i tētahi haere utu nui?","The best answer that aligns with the premise (P) is **C: Whakataurite utu i waenga i ngā kamupene haere maha** and **D: Tirohia te paetukutuku a te waka rererangi**.

Here's why:

*   The premise (P) states that it's essential to compare prices across different travel agents (kaiwhakakōnanunanu) and also check the airline's website directly before buying a ticket because prices can vary significantly. It is essential for all travel, especially a trip that is considered expensive.

Option **A: Rapua ngā tuku a ngā kamupene haerenga maha** is also an ok option because the premise suggests to compare prices across the different travel agents, which means you would need to ""Rapua ngā tuku a ngā kamupene haerenga maha"".

Option **B: Puka hāngai tonu ki te waka rererangi** could save money, but the premise is all about research so it's not the best answer.

Therefore, **A, C and D** are all acceptable answers."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, me aha ngā haere i te tuatahi kia haumaru ai i ngā utu rererangi tino pai rawa atu?","The correct answer is **B: Whakatauritea ngā utu i waenganui i ngā kaiwhakawhiwhi rerekē**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...he pai te whakatairite i ngā putanga rapunga... "" which translates to ""it is good to compare search results..."".

The passage also mentions checking the airline's website (A), but it's presented as *additional* to comparing prices between different providers, not as the *first* step.  The passage doesn't specifically mention *tuhia tika* (booking directly) using either an airline (C) or a travel agent (D) and is therefore not supported by the text.
"
He aha te wā e hiahiatia ai he hoa ki te haere tahi ki te tuku?,"The correct answer is **C: Mēnā kei te tukuna ngā mea hei peke rehitatia**.

The passage states: ""Ko ngā ture a te taunga rererangi, ka kore e tukuna ngā pēke ki te kore tētahi tangata e rere, ko koe tēnā."" (The airport rules don't allow bags to be sent unless someone is flying, and that's you.)  This directly implies that if items are being sent as checked baggage, a person (the ""hoa"" or companion) needs to travel with them.
"
"I runga anō i te haerenga, i a koe e whiriwhiri ana i tētahi kamupene rererangi Frequent Flyer i roto i tētahi hononga, ko tēhea o ngā mea e whai ake nei e tika ana kia whakaūhia e koe?","Based on the provided text, the most relevant answer is **C: Ko te kamupene rererangi e haere pinepine ana koe (The airline you fly most frequently)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes that even if your preferred airline is being acquired, understanding the differences in benefits and ease of earning points across different airlines is crucial.
*   Flying frequently with a particular airline within the alliance allows you to accumulate points faster and potentially achieve higher status tiers, which come with more benefits.

While the other options might be considerations, they are not as directly tied to the advice given in the passage:

*   **A: Ko te kamupene rererangi e tuku ana i te nuinga o ngā tohu (The airline that offers the most points)** - While earning points is important, focusing solely on the number of points without considering other factors like route availability or redemption options might not be the best strategy.
*   **B: Ko te kamupene rererangi i roto i te hononga nui rawa atu (The airline in the largest alliance)** - The size of the alliance doesn't guarantee the best benefits or redemption options for your specific travel needs.
*   **D: Ko te kamupene rererangi pea e tāpiri ana i ētahi atu mana motuhake (The airline that may add other special powers)** - This option is too ambiguous.

Therefore, option **C** aligns best with the text's emphasis on considering the airline you fly most often when choosing a frequent flyer program within an alliance."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko wai e tuku atu ana i ētahi atu frequent flyer?","The correct answer is **D: He kamupene rererangi rerekē i roto i te hononga kotahi**.

The passage says that after a merger, other airlines within the new alliance may offer better frequent flyer benefits.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tēhea o ngā pūkenga e whai ake nei ka pāngia e te haurangi?","Based on the provided passage, the correct answer is **B: Tirohanga (Vision)**.

The passage states that drinking unregulated alcohol can lead to blindness (""e kāpō ai""). This directly links alcohol consumption to impairment of vision. While alcohol can affect other senses, the passage specifically mentions blindness as a potential consequence.
"
"E ai ki te kōrero i roto i te haerenga, he aha e taea ai te whakaiti i ngā pānga kino o te waipiro?","The passage focuses on the negative effects of alcohol and the dangers of unregulated alcohol. It *doesn't* suggest ways to *mitigate* the harmful effects of alcohol itself in a responsible way. However, it does say that unregulated alcohol can contain methanol, which can lead to blindness or death. Therefore, the only answer that aligns with the text is:

*   **C: Tīmata ana i te waipiro i runga i te ngāwari** (Starting alcohol gradually)

None of the other options can be inferred from the text."
Kei whea ngā uara o ngā whare i waenganui i ngā uara o Amsterdam?,"The correct answer is **A: Te Takiwā o Canal**.

The passage states that the Canal District is famous and its real estate values are among the highest in the city.
"
He aha i whakaingoatia ai te Takiwa o te Canal hei Taonga Taonga o te Ao a UNESCO?,"The correct answer is **A, B, and D**.

The passage states the Canal District is a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its:

*   **Ahurea, hītori ahurei (Cultural and unique history):** This directly translates to ""Cultural and unique history,"" covering options A and B.
*   **Nga uara whenua tiketike (High property values):** This translates to ""High property values,"" covering option D.

Option C (He tauwāhi e karapoti ana i te Binnenstad - A location surrounding the Binnenstad) is true, but it is a characteristic of the Canal District, not the reason it was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e haere ana ki Phnom Krom whai painga?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **A: Te tirohanga i runga i a Tonle Sap**.

Kei te kōrero te wāhanga e hiahiatia ai te piki i te puke o Phnom Krom nā te mea ko te āhua hiawe o te temepara me te tirohanga o runga i te roto Tonle Sap te mea e hiahiatia ana.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea e hiahiatia ana kia tomo ngā manuhiri ki Phnom Krom?","The correct answer is **C: Kei te tiki i te Hipa Angkor**.

The passage states: ""Me whiwhi i te Pāhi Angkor kia tomo i te temepara..."" which translates to ""An Angkor Pass is required to enter the temple..."".
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tehea o ēnei e āhei ai te turuhi ki te haere ki Antarctica?","Based on the provided passage, the best answer is:

**B: Ko te hiahia anake ki te tūhura i te Moana Ross**

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""...kua mātua whakawhāititia ki te Peninsula, ngā Islands me te Ross Sea."" This means tourist activity is largely limited to these areas.
*   **The passage states:** ""...ka taea anake te tū ki te raumati atu i te marama o Nōema ki Pēpuere..."" This means tourist activity is limited to these months.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: He tahua haere whānui:** The passage explicitly mentions that tours are expensive.
*   **C: He hōtaka mahi e āhei ai te haere i a Hōnea me Hānuere:** The passage states that tourist activity is limited to November to February (raumati).
*   **D: Ngā nekeneke ōkiko whāiti:** The passage mentions that it is necessary to be physically robust.

Therefore, the only option that directly aligns with the limitations described in the passage is **B**."
Ka toro atu te turuhi e hiahia ana ki te eke maunga ki tehea wahanga o Antarctica?,"The correct answer is **B: Te takiwā o te Whenua**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka haere tuawhenua ngā haerenga rere motuhake i ētahi wā ruarua, mō te eke maunga, te tae atu rānei ki te Tōpito o te Ao, kei reira tētahi wāhi noho nui."" This translates to ""Special flights go inland on rare occasions, for mountaineering or reaching the South Pole, where there is a major settlement.""  Therefore, mountaineering expeditions go to the interior of Antarctica."
Kei whea te wāhi iti rawa o te tūnga o tētahi mātakitaki i mua i te wā o nāianei?,"The passage states: ""Ko te nuinga o ngā whare mātai ātea tawhito e korehāhā ana i tēnei rā, ā, ka noho tohu hei whare taonga, hei wāhi whakaako rānei... ka kitea i ngā tāone kei taua takiwā me ngā kuratini, he māmā ake te toro atu i ngā mea i hangaia ō mohoa nei."" This implies that older observatories were located in or near towns and colleges, making them easily accessible. Therefore, the best answer is:

*   **B: I te pokapū o te taone** (In the center of town)
*   **D: I runga i tētahi whare kāreti** (On a college building)
    Since there is no clear answer I will select the answer with the most evidence from the passage.

**The best answer is D:**"
Kei whea te wāhi e tū ai tētahi pouaka whakaata rangahau hou?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: I roto i tētahi pānga nui**.

The passage states that modern research telescopes are ""large structures in remote locations with good atmospheric conditions"". This directly implies they are in a remote, likely large, setting - a ""pānga nui"".

The other options are incorrect based on the passage:

*   **A: I roto i tētahi whare taonga** - The passage mentions old observatories becoming museums, not new telescopes.
*   **B: I runga i tētahi whare wānanga** - The passage mentions old observatories being near towns and universities, making them easier to visit, but doesn't mention that modern telescopes are located at universities.
*   **C: I tētahi pae akoranga** - While research telescopes are used for learning, the passage states they are built in remote locations, not necessarily on learning sites."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea e kore e whakaarotia he tohutohu tika mō te whakatangitangi pai i te kōkiri?","The correct answer is **A: Mō tētahi atu rōrahi, whakanuia te tōpana i patua ai e koe ngā kī**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kia maumahara kāore he take mō te pato i ngā patooro ki te tōpana nui mō te oro teitei ake pērā i tā te piano"" which translates to ""Remember there is no need to hit the keys with a lot of force for a higher volume like a piano.""

Therefore, increasing the force with which you hit the keys for more volume is **not** good advice for playing the kōkiri.
"
"I a koe e whakatangi ana i te kōkiri, ko tehea o ngā mea e whai ake nei ka āwhina ki te whakanui ake i te reo?","The correct answer is **A: Tere anō**.

The passage states that ""ki te kōriana, kia nui ake te kahaoro, ka whakamahia ngā pupuhi ki te pēhanga nui ake, te tere nui ake rānei."" This translates to ""for forte, to get more volume, you use strokes with more pressure, or more speed."" Thus, increased speed contributes to increased volume when playing the kōkiri (which I'm assuming is a stringed instrument based on the piano analogy in the text).
"
He aha i tapahia ai ngā rohe o ngā whakaahua i runga i te pouaka whakaata?,"The correct answer is **B: Nō reira ka whakakī te atahanga i te mata katoa.**

The passage states that TVs are made to appeal to the general public, and that the sides of the image are cut off so that the picture fills the entire screen. This aligns perfectly with option B.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tehea o ngā raruraru e whai ake nei ka kitea e te tangata ina hurihia he kiriata ki te hōputu DVD?","The correct answer is **B: tapahia tētahi wāhanga o ngā taitararoto**.

The passage specifically mentions that if subtitles are too close to the bottom edge of the film, they might be cut off when creating a DVD due to overscan.
"
I hea tētahi Garrison Peretania?,"The correct answer is **C: Bordentown**.

The text states that General John Cadwalder would take a diversionary route towards Bordentown to prevent the British from retaking supplies. This implies that a British garrison was located there.
"
Ko wai te waitohu i puta mai i runga i te hukihuki tuhi ā-ringa?,"The passage states: ""Whai muri i tana whakaaetanga e te Congress i te rā 4 o Hūrae, ka tukuna tētahi tuhinga hukihuki kua hainatia e te President of Congress a John Hancock rāua ko Secretary Charles Thompson ētahi poraka atu ki te toa tā a John Dunlap.""

This clearly indicates that the draft was signed by John Hancock and Charles Thompson. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Charles Thomson.
"
"I roto i ngā wāhi e whai ake nei, ko tēhea te wāhi whakamutunga i tae mai ai tētahi waka a Dunlap?","The passage states that a copy reached London on August 10th. The passage also mentions a copy was sent to George Washington in New York on July 6th and read to his troops on July 9th. Since August 10th comes after July 9th, London was the last place mentioned in the passage to receive a Dunlap broadside.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: London**
"
I whea nga hōia a Kānara Stark e noho ana?,"The correct answer is **A: I te pito ki te raki, i te taha o te taiapa.**

The passage states: ""I tū atu ā Stark tāngata ki te pahiko o te pito raki o te tūnga o te Colonist"" and later describes the fence/barrier (taiapa) being extended. Therefore, Stark's men were stationed at the northern end (pito raki) next to the taiapa/fence.
"
"E ai ki te whārangi nei, nō whea i whakawhānui ai ngā tangata a Stark i tō rātou taiepa?","The correct answer is **C: I te wa o te tai iti**.

The passage states: ""I te kōara a te tai timu i tētahi āputa ki te taha o te Mystic River ki te raki mā rāwhiti o te raenga kūiti, ka tere tā rātou whakaroa ake i te taiapa ki tētahi pātū kōhatu poto...""

This translates to: ""As the **ebb tide** revealed a gap along the Mystic River northeast of the isthmus, they quickly extended the fence to a short stone wall...""

Therefore, the extension of the fence happened during the ebb tide (te tai timu).
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā wā e whai ake nei tētahi o ngā wā tino tutu o Haina?","The correct answer is **D: Ko nga rangatiratanga e toru (The Three Kingdoms)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ko te Three Kingdoms tētahi o ngā wā tino rere te toto i te hītori o Ancient China"" (The Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China).
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te pono o te whenua taua e tomo ana ki tētahi wāhanga nomadic?","The correct answer is **B: He iti noa iho ta rātau kai** (They have very little food).

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Ka tīmata te huinga i tētahi wā tipiwhenua ina heke haere te kai e wātea ana."" This directly translates to: ""The colony starts a nomadic phase when the available food decreases.""

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: Ka kōhanga rātau i te pō** (They nest at night): The passage states they nest during the day.
*   **C: Ka mahia e rātau he kōhanga kua hurihia i muri i te 17 rā** (They make a changed nest after 17 days): The passage states they change nests *every* day during this phase.
*   **D: E hīkoi ana rātau i te rā** (They walk during the day): The passage states they walk at night and are sedentary during the day.

Therefore, the only answer supported by the passage as a cause of the nomadic phase is the lack of food.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea kōrero e whakaatu tika ana i nga tikanga kōhanga o nga whenua taua i te wā o te wāhanga nomadic?","The correct answer is **C: Ka hurihia e rātau ngā kōhanga ia rā**.

The passage states: ""I tēnei wā, ka hangaia e te huinga ngā kōhanga taupua ka panonitia ia rā"" which translates to ""At this time, the colony builds temporary nests that are changed daily"".
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei ka haere tonu ahakoa ngā tohu o waho?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngā karaka koiora**.

The passage states: ""Ko ngā karaka koiora he mea ngapu kei te tautīnei i a rātou anō ka haere tonu te wā o te huringa rere noa ahakoa kei te ngaro ngā tohu nō waho."" This directly translates to: ""Biological clocks are internal things that regulate themselves and continue the cycle even if external cues are missing.""

Therefore, the biological clocks continue despite the absence of external cues.
"
He aha te kupu e whakaahua ana i ngā tāngata e whakaatu ana i ngā rerekētanga o tētahi āhuatanga phenotypic?,"The correct answer is **D: Polymorphic**.

Here's why:

*   **P: (Premise)** defines a population as a group of organisms of the same species within a defined area. It then states that if all individuals in a population have the same trait, it's called monomorphic. Conversely, if a species shows a wide variety of traits, it's considered genetically diverse.
*   **Q: (Question)** asks for the term describing individuals with variations in a phenotypic trait.
*   **Polymorphic** (from the definition in P) specifically refers to a population displaying variations in phenotypic traits.
*   **Monomorphic** (opposite of polymorphic) means having only one form or trait.
*   **Ngā Rauropi** (Organisms) is too broad.
*   **Nga momo** (Species) is also too broad."
Ko tēhea o ēnei kupu e tika ana mō ngā rauropi e noho ana i tētahi wāhi motuhake?,"The correct answer is **B: Iwi Whānui (Population)**.

Here's why:

* **P** defines a population as a biological collection of a single species within a defined area.
* **Q** asks for a word for organisms living in a specific area.
* **Iwi Whānui** translates directly to ""population"" in English, making it the appropriate term for organisms living in a specific area as defined in **P**.

The other options are incorrect:

* **Monomorphic:**  Refers to a population where all individuals share the same trait or form.
* **Nga momo:** Means ""species.""
* **Polymorphic:** Refers to a population with multiple different forms or traits.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te tauira o tētahi mahi tūruhi e hāngai ana ki te taiao?,"The correct answer is **C: Haere ana ki tētahi whare taonga pūtaiao**

Here's why:

*   **P (the prompt)** defines ecotourism as activities where people who enjoy visiting natural places to appreciate the scenery, including plants and animals.
*   **A:** Waiting to die of thirst is not an ecotourism activity.
*   **B:** Photographing natives is not an ecotourism activity.
*   **C:** Going to a science museum is not an ecotourism activity.
*   **D:** Fly fishing is an ecotourism activity."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei te take o te pūnaha waka?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā motokā tūmataiti** (Private cars).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""... kua honotahi, kua tautoko hoki te katoa i tētahi pūnaha kawenga e hāngai ana ki ngā **waka tūmatawhāiti**."" This translates to ""...everyone is united and supports a transportation system based on **private cars**.""
*   The passage is about the negative impact of carbon-intensive economies which are linked to the use of private cars for transport.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: ūnga mahi** (work destination) is simply where people are traveling. It is not the basis of the transport system.
*   **C: He ao koiora pūmau** (A stable biosphere) is the *opposite* of what the system causes.
*   **D: kunenga tangata** (Human evolution) is mentioned as something that has benefited from a stable atmosphere, which is now threatened by the transportation system."
He aha te momo utu o ngā matūriki e karapoti ana i te karihi?,"The correct answer is **C: Utu tōraro**

The passage states: ""He tōraro te whana hiko iriiho."" which translates to ""The electron has a negative electric charge."" and electrons orbit the nucleus.
"
Ko tehea matūriki te tito o te karihi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā Proton me ngā neutron**

The text states: ""E rua ngā pūtūmua o te karihi - ngā iramoe me ngā iraoho."" which translates to: ""The nucleus has two components - neutrons and protons.""
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he tauira o tētahi tau taurangi e rima ngā moka?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **C: 10010**

**He whakamārama:**

*   **He aha te moka (bit)?** E ai ki te wāhanga, he mati tāhūrua te moka. Ko te tikanga ka taea e ia te 0, te 1 rānei.
*   **E hia ngā moka?** Kei te pātai te pātai mō tētahi tau taurangi e rima ngā moka. Ko te tikanga kia rima ngā mati o te tau, ā, ko ia mati he 0, he 1 rānei.

**Tirohia ngā kōwhiringa:**

*   **A: 1010** - E whā ngā mati, nō reira ehara i te rima ngā moka.
*   **B: 12001** - Kei roto ngā mati ehara i te 0, i te 1 rānei, nō reira ehara i te tau taurangi.
*   **C: 10010** - E rima ngā mati, ā, ko ia mati he 0, he 1 rānei. He tauira tika tēnei o te tau taurangi e rima ngā moka.
*   **D: 110101** - E ono ngā mati, nō reira ehara i te rima ngā moka."
He aha hoki te ingoa o ngā mati taurangi?,"The correct answer is **A: Moka**.

The passage states: ""e kīia ana ēnei tau hei mati tāhūrua - hei moka ranei, kia whakamahia te kupu rorohiko"" which translates to: ""these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, in computer terms.""
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e kore e whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga hei painga matua o te rangitaki ākonga?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **B: He hekenga o te whakahē a nga hoa noho**.

Ahakoa e kōrero ana te wāhanga mō te karo i te whakahē, ko te whakahēnga e whakahuatia ana i konei e pā ana ki te hunga pānui whānui, ā, ko te tikanga ko ngā ākonga tonu hei minenga. Kāore te wāhanga e kī ana ka heke te whakahē a ngā hoa noho.

Ko ētahi atu kōwhiringa e whakahuatia ana:

*   **A: He whakapai ake i te āheitanga wetereo me te tuhituhi** - E kī ana te wāhanga ""He pai ngā rangitaki ki te whakakoi ake i ngā pukenga tuhi.""
*   **C: He mōhiotanga whakawhānui ki ngā karapoti** - E kī ana te wāhanga "" Mā te rangitaki hoki """"e tuku ai ngā ākonga te mōhio ake mō te ao e noho nei rātou.""""
*   **D: He nui ake te hiahia mo te ako haere tonu** - E kī ana te wāhanga ""me te akiaki i ngā ākonga kia whāroa ake te ako i tua atu i tētahi rangi noa i te kura.""
"
Ko tēhea o ngā āhuatanga e whai ake nei o te rangitaki e whakahuatia ana hei akiaki mō ngā ākonga ki te whakapai ake i ō rātou pūkenga tuhituhi?,"The correct answer is **B: Te tohe kia karo i te whakahē**.

The passage specifically mentions that students, as a critical audience, motivate the blogger to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism (""Nā te mea he nui te wā ko ngā ākonga te minenga tino whakahē, ka tīmata te kaituhi rangitaki ki te whai kia whakapai ake i te tuhinga hei karo i te whakahēnga."").
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai hua ana i te whakawhitiwhiti kōrero asynchronous mō ngā ākonga? ,"The correct answer is **D: Mana Pace** (Pace Control).

Here's why:

*   **P: Mā te whakawhitinga kōrero kāore i te wā tonu e āki ai te wā mō te whai whakaaro, me te urupare ki ētahi atu.** - This part of the prompt directly supports the idea of pace control. Asynchronous communication provides time for reflection and response, allowing students to learn at their own pace.

*   **E āhei ana ngā tauira ki te mahi ki tāna i pai ai, ki tāna i kī ai mō te āhua ki ngā pārongo tohutohu.** - This reinforces the idea of students working at their own desired pace when addressing information.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **A: Ko te whakamahinga o te ipurangi hei rauemi** (The use of the internet as a resource) - While the internet is essential for asynchronous communication, it is not necessarily a benefit *of* asynchronous communication. It is a tool *for* it.

*   **B: Te uru kanohi ki te kanohi ki ngā kaiako i ngā wā katoa o te rā** (Face-to-face access to teachers at all times of the day) - Asynchronous communication is the opposite of face-to-face interaction.

*   **C: Ngā hāora mahi ngāwari** (Flexible working hours) - While mentioned in the text, the focus is more on the *student's* flexible pace and the ability to engage with the material at their own speed. Flexible hours are a related benefit, but pace control is more central to the definition of asynchronous communication and the benefits described."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā aronga e whai ake nei o te whakawhitiwhitinga whakarihariha ehara i te mea māmā mō ngā ākonga?","Based on the provided text, the passage *doesn't* say that any of the options are *not* easy for students through asynchronous communication. In fact, it suggests the opposite:

*   **A: Tere ako (Learning pace):** The passage mentions that asynchronous communication allows students to work at their own pace.
*   **B: Ngā haora mahi (Work hours):** The passage explicitly says that there are fewer time constraints and the ability to work during flexible hours.
*   **C: Rauemi tohutohu (Instructional materials):** The passage mentions that students can work with and reflect on instructional materials.
*   **D: Whakamahinga Ipurangi (Internet usage):** The passage explicitly says that the Internet allows students to access information at all times.

However, of the available options, the least emphasized positive aspect of asynchronous learning within this specific passage is *the speed of learning*. While the passage does say that asynchronous learning allows students to *learn at their own pace*, it does not necessarily mention how it can make learning *faster*. So, this is the best possible answer.

Therefore, the answer is **A: Tere ako (Learning pace)**."
He aha te mea e kore e whakahuatia i roto i te whiti hei mea ka taea e te tangata te hono atu ki nga whare rangatira o mua?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngā Kōroa**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Ngā rua Dungeon (Dungeons):** The passage mentions ""te mataku e whanake haere ana i ngā rua poka"" which implies dungeons.
*   **B: Ngā Jousts (Jousts):** The passage mentions ""whakaahua o ngā whakataetae"" which implies jousts.
*   **C: Chivalry:** The passage mentions ""te hoahoatanga Arthurian anō hoki"" which implies ideals of chivalry.
*   **D: Ngā Kōroa (Choirs):** Choirs are not explicitly mentioned in the passage.

Therefore, choirs are the only thing not mentioned in the passage."
"Ko tehea o ēnei e kore e whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga hei kakara, he haruru rānei e taea ana te whakahuatia i waenganui i ngā parekura o te whare?","The correct answer is **C: Hākari (Feasts)**

Here's why:

*   **P: Kua roa te pākaha tūturu nō neherā e whakaawe ana i te whakaaro, ka whakaarohia he whakaahua o ngā whakataetae, ngā hākari, te hoahoatanga Arthurian anō hoki.** (P: The haunting reality of the ancient past has long influenced thought, conjuring images of tournaments, feasts, and even Arthurian architecture.)
*   **Ahakoa kei te tū ki roto i ngā whare pakaru kotahi mano tau te tawhito he māmā te tō mai ki te hinengaro ngā oro me ngā rongo o ngā pakanga i neherā, kia tata rongo i te tatangi pāua ki ngā kōhatu, me te rongo i te mataku e whanake haere ana i ngā rua poka.** (Even standing in the ruins of castles a thousand years old, it is easy to bring to mind the sights and sounds of battles of the past, to almost hear the clash of armor against stone, and to feel the fear that would have lingered in the dungeons.)

The passage mentions:

*   **Ngā Pakanga (Battles)**: The sounds and sights of battles.
*   **Wehi (Fear)**: The fear lingering in the dungeons.
*   **Hooves**: The text describes ""te tatangi pāua ki ngā kōhatu,"" which translates to ""the clashing of armor against stone"".

Hākari (Feasts) are mentioned as something that the *image* of a castle evokes, but not as a smell or sound one might imagine experiencing within the ruins themselves.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he whakaahuatanga tika o Kirby Muxloe Castle?,"The correct answer is **B: I hiahiatia he iti rawa te taiepa na te āhua rangimarie o te whenua i te wā i hangaia ai**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that when Lord Hastings began building in the 1480s, the land was relatively peaceful (""he āhua maungārongo ki te whenua""). Because of this peaceful time, the castle only needed to defend against small groups of marauders (""ka hiahiatia anake te whakawawao ki ngā rōpū iti o te hunga konihi e hāereere ana""). This implies a lesser need for substantial defenses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I tonoa nga pakitara mātotoru o te kōrere e te Lord Hastings** This statement is the opposite of what the text indicates; the text points toward a castle that did not need thick walls.
*   **C: Ehara te hanganga o te maka i te mea noa iho mo te wā kotahi** We don't have enough information to confirm or deny this claim.
*   **D: I hangaia hei tautoko i ngā whakaekenga roa, whakatau hoki** The passage suggests the opposite; it was built for defense against *small* threats, not major sieges."
Ko tēhea o ngā āhuatanga hanga e whai ake nei e kiia ana ehara i te tikanga mo Kirby Muxloe Castle i te wā e whakaahuatia ana i te wāhanga?,"The correct answer is **B: He tūranga i hangaia hai tautoko i ngā whakaekenga**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the castle was built when the land was relatively peaceful.
*   The passage is explicitly referencing that the *big windows* and *thin walls* were not built to fend off attacks.
*   The passage states that the castle was built to *only* defend against small groups of robbers.

Therefore, option B, which suggests the castle was built for active defense/offense, is not supported by the text and represents a feature *not* typical of Kirby Muxloe Castle as described."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei te tino whai painga mo te kaioma e takatū ana mo te wā e tū mai nei?","The passage states that during the off-season (which is implied to be winter, based on the reference to long runs in winter), weight training is important for the upper body. Therefore, the best answer is:

**D: E whakamahi ana i te whare tākaro ki te mahi i te tinana o runga** (Using the gym to work on the upper body)

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Te whakangungu i te rere whenua i te raumati** (Training in the ground in the summer) This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: Te arotahi ki te whakawhanake i te tere i te wā e whakangungu ana** (Focusing on developing speed while training) While speed is still important, the passage emphasizes endurance for the half-mile. It's more about maintaining some speed while building endurance.
*   **C: patupatu i te toru meneti** (hitting 3 minutes) The passage says the athlete must run the half mile in under two minutes. This is not a relevant consideration for the off season."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he tino hiranga mo te kaioma haurua maero tuatahi?","The passage emphasizes that while speed is still important for a sub-two-minute half-miler, endurance becomes paramount. It states, ""speed becomes less important, and endurance becomes the name of the game.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: E whakaputa ana i te manawanui i runga i te tere (Developing endurance on top of speed)**. This aligns with the passage's focus on building endurance while acknowledging the existing speed required for that level of runner.

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Te whakahaere i te rere whenua i ngā marama o te hotoke (Managing off-road running in the winter months)**: While the passage mentions long runs in winter, it's presented as a method *to build* endurance, not the primary characteristic of a successful half-miler.
*   **C: E karaka ana i raro i te rua meneti (Clocking in under two minutes)**: This is a benchmark for speed, which is important but less critical than endurance, according to the passage.
*   **D: Tere whakaputa i runga i te manawanui (Producing speed on top of endurance)**: The passage implies the opposite - building endurance on top of existing speed. It says speed is already present but needs to be supplemented with endurance."
"Mo te kaitākaro, ko tehea o ēnei e kore e taea te whakatutuki mā te kai anake?","Based on the passage, the answer is **C: Mahinga Elite (Elite Performance)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that ""E kore te tangata e tohunga i tētahi mahi mā te tika o te kai anake"" which translates to ""A person will not become an expert in a task through correct eating alone"". The passage implies that elite performance requires more than just good nutrition.
*   The other options (Mahinga pai ake / Better performance, Te nui ake o te hākinakina / More enjoyment of sports) are directly mentioned as potential benefits from the combination of good nutrition, hydration, and understanding physical conditioning.
*   Option D (Poka Ahuwhānui / Generalized Drill) doesn't make sense in the context of the text.

Therefore, the passage indicates that while good nutrition helps with performance and enjoyment, achieving elite performance requires additional factors."
"I runga anō i te wāhanga nei, ko tehea o ngā mea e whai ake nei e kore e tūtohutia hei huarahi kia nui ake ai te ahuareka o ngā kaitākaro taitamariki i a rātau hākinakina?","The correct answer is **B: E tika ana te mahi i tētahi taumata rangatira**

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes the importance of proper diet, hydration, and understanding the nuances of physical conditioning for young athletes to improve their training and enjoy their sport more.

*   Options A, C, and D all align with the ideas presented in the passage: proper diet, hydration, and maintaining a healthy energy balance are all ways to improve performance and enjoyment.

*   Option B, ""E tika ana te mahi i tētahi taumata rangatira"" (Performing at an elite level), does not align. While striving for improvement is good, the passage's focus is on enjoying the sport. Focusing solely on achieving an ""elite level"" can create undue pressure and detract from the enjoyment of the sport. It doesn't contribute to the aim of making sports more enjoyable for young athletes."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha pea ka hokona e tētahi kaioma tawhiti he taonga utu nui ake?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **A: Ko tō rātou manakohanga whaiaro tēnei.**

Ko te take i pēnei ai:

*   E kī ana te kōrero ""Ka whakaaro ake ētahi kaiaka he pai ake rātou ki tētahi taputapu ahakoa kāore he hua tika ka kitea."" Ko te tikanga, ahakoa kāore he take whaitake, ka hokona tonu e rātou te taputapu nā tō rātou manakohanga whaiaro.

Ko ngā take i hē ai ētahi atu kōwhiringa:

*   **B: Kua kitea e ia ngā painga:** E kī ana te kōrero kāore he hua tika ka kitea.
*   **C: Ka tino pā ki ta rātau mahinga:** E kī ana te kōrero kāore te nuinga e tino pā ki te mahi.
*   **D: He whakaaro hē e pā ana ki ngā taputapu iti iho te utu:** Kua kīia he iti noa te utu o te oma tawhiti i te timatanga, ehara i te mea e whakaaro hē ana rātou. Ko te manakohanga whaiaro te pūtake."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te hiahia o te rere tawhiti o waenganui?","The correct answer is **C: Ngā taputapu iti rawa**.

The passage states: ""He iti noa te utu o te oma tawhiti"" which translates to ""Long distance running is inexpensive"" or ""Long distance running has small expenses"". It then goes on to say ""...he nui ngā heitara mō ngā taputapu iti nei..."" which translates to ""... but there is a lot of spending on the small items...""

Therefore, the central need is **minimal equipment** as that makes it an inexpensive sport. While it does mention that people *can* spend a lot, the core aspect of the sport (making it accessible) is the need for minimal equipment.
"
Na wai i kite i te whakaata autō ngota? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch me te Purcell**.

The passage states that MRI is based on the physics principle of nuclear magnetic resonance, which was discovered by Felix Bloch and Edward Purcell.
"
He aha te tau i tukuna ai te ārai tuatahi mo te whakahoki atahanga rongoā? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

The passage states: ""E whā tau ki muri ka tukuna tētahi raihana motuhake, koirā te raihana motuhake tuatahi o te ao i tukuna ki te mātai MRI."" This translates to ""Four years before [1977] a patent was filed, it was the world's first patent granted for MRI technology."" Therefore, the patent was filed in 1977 - 4 = 1974.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te tikanga kia kaha te mōhiotanga o te tangata kia whakamārama ai i nga mahi ōkiko a ētahi atu?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **D: Whakaarotanga**.

E ai ki te wāhanga, he mea taketake te **whakaarotanga** (mārama ki te takunetanga o ētahi atu) kia āhei ai te whakatau i ngā rangirua o ngā mahi ā-tinana. Ko te mohio ki te take o te mahi a te tangata, te *take* i pākaru ai ia i te matapihi, te mea e taea ai e tatou te whakatau i te ahua o taua mahi."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ka āwhina te whakaaro mātauranga i te tangata ki te mahi i te aha?","The correct answer is **A: Whakakorea te kore mōhio i muri i ngā mahi ā-tinana.**

Let's break down why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Mā korā tātou e āhei ai te whakatau i ngā rangirua o ngā mahi ā-tinana."" This directly translates to ""This allows us to resolve the ambiguities of physical actions."" ""Rangirua"" means ambiguity or confusion.
*   **Option A** talks about ""Whakakorea te kore mōhio i muri i ngā mahi ā-tinana"", which essentially means to remove the uncertainty or lack of knowledge behind physical actions.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Ngā hiahia matapae** (Predicting desires) - While the passage mentions predicting thoughts and beliefs, the primary focus is on understanding the *reason* behind actions.
*   **C: Tirohia ētahi atu tangata me te kore whakawā** (Look at other people without judgment) - While a better understanding of actions can lead to less judgmental behavior, this isn't the direct purpose stated in the passage.
*   **D: Pānuitia nga hinengaro o ētahi atu** (Read the minds of others) - The passage mentions predicting thoughts, but the emphasis is on understanding the intention behind observed actions, not literally reading minds.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he whakarāpopoto tika o te take matua o AI?","The best answer is **D: Aunoatanga tūmahi** (Task automation).

Here's why:

*   The passage focuses on AI's ability to simplify tasks that require intelligent behavior, such as scheduling, customer service, and recognition of handwriting, speech, and faces.
*   These are all examples of automating tasks that would normally require human intelligence.

Let's look at why the other options are not as good:

*   **A: Whakarite (Scheduling):** Scheduling is *an example* of what AI can do, but it's not the main point of AI itself.
*   **B: Āhukahuka reo (Speech recognition):** Similar to scheduling, speech recognition is a specific application, not the core concept.
*   **C: Kei te whakarite (Is scheduling):** Same reason as A. It is just one of many things that AI can do.

**Therefore, ""Aunoatanga tūmahi"" (Task automation) encapsulates the central idea that AI is about automating tasks previously requiring human-level intelligence.**"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e pāhono ana ki te AI?","The correct answer is **D: Āhuka tuhiāringa (Handwriting recognition)**.

The passage explicitly mentions ""te mōhiotanga o te tuhi ā-ringa (handwriting recognition)"" as an example of tasks that AI can simplify. While A and B are also mentioned, the question asks for *which of these* is related to AI.  D is the only option directly drawn from the text. C is mentioned as a source of misunderstanding about AI, but it's not an application or aspect of AI itself.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he kaha o tētahi tangata whai tauira whakaaro ūngutu?","The correct answer is **D: Ngā tauira Memorizing.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes:** The ability to remember patterns (tauira), correct errors, and conduct scientific experiments. Memorization of patterns is a direct reflection of this.
* **Other options are incorrect because:**
    * **A:** The passage states there is only ONE correct answer.
    * **B:** The passage states that one of the focuses is reorienting current methods. 
    * **C:** The passage indicates that the focus of this type of thinking is speed."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tehea o nga mea e whai ake nei kare e kiia ko te aronga o te whakaaro huritao?","The correct answer is **B: Kei te mau i te wā kotahi (Keeping it at the same time)**.

The passage states that convergent thinking focuses on:

*   **Tere (speed)**
*   **Whakakaupapa (focus)**
*   **Tika (accuracy)**
*   **Tautuhi i ngā meka (identifying facts)**
*   **Whakahāngai anō i ngā tikanga o nāianei (revising existing methods)**
*   **Kohi mōhiohio (collecting information)**
*   **Kotahi noa te whakautu tika (only one right answer)**

Option B is the only one that is not mentioned in the original paragraph, therefore that is the correct answer."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e kore e whakaarotia he pēhi moroiti?","The passage defines micro-expressions as ""eye movements that last only a few milliseconds."" Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: Kei te kōrero atu a Glancing i a ia e kōrero ana (Glancing while talking):** Glancing can be a quick eye movement, potentially fitting the description of a micro-expression.

*   **B: E whakangao ana i te rae (Furrowing the brow):** Furrowing the brow involves movement of facial muscles, not the eyes.

*   **C: Tere te hononga (Rapid blinking):** Rapid blinking is an eye movement, and ""tere"" (rapid) implies it's short in duration, potentially a micro-expression.

*   **D: Kei te tuku kōnui (Twitching):** Twitching can involve small, involuntary muscle movements, including in the face, and could be very brief (milliseconds).

Therefore, the answer is **B: E whakangao ana i te rae (Furrowing the brow)** because it refers to the forehead muscles moving and not the eye movement itself."
Ko tēhea o ngā tauākī e whai ake nei e pā ana ki te whakamāramatanga pēhi moroiti ehara i te tika?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka whakamāramatia te kōrero me ngā kīanga kanohi.**

Here's why:

*   **P: (Premise)** talks about using video analysis to understand *micro-expressions*, which are very brief (milliseconds) facial movements. It suggests that these micro-expressions *might* be used to detect deception. It also talks about how people with brain damage affecting language comprehension can still understand emotions, and how animals might also be good at understanding human behavior.
*   **A:** Accurately reflects the premise - video capture has led to breakthroughs.
*   **B:** Accurately reflects the premise - accurate interpretation may detect lying.
*   **D:** Accurately reflects the premise - may help assess truthfulness (linked to detecting deception).
*   **C:** This statement is not directly supported by the provided information. While facial expressions are mentioned in the context of micro-expressions and understanding emotions, the passage doesn't say that micro-expression analysis *explains language.* The passage mentions that the micro-expression analysis is not about language (kōrero) but about non-verbal communication.

Therefore, option C is not explicitly discussed in passage P and is the correct answer."
Ko tēhea o ēnei mea e whai ake nei i tino hira i te mutunga o te Renaissance? ,"Based on the provided passage (P), the Renaissance shifted the focus of learning from memorization to understanding the meaning of words and spreading knowledge.

Therefore, the most accurate answer from the options is:

**B: E whakaputa ana i te mātauranga (Producing knowledge)**

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: auporo takitahi (Individual memorization):** The passage explicitly states that the focus shifted *away* from individual memorization.
*   **C: auporo kuputuhi (Text memorization):** Similar to option A, the focus was no longer solely on memorizing texts, but understanding their meaning.
*   **D: Kei te whiwhi mōhiohio (Receiving information):** While receiving information is a part of learning, the passage emphasizes the generation and spread of knowledge as a key development of the Renaissance."
"I te mutunga o te Renaissance, he iti ake te arotahi ki tehea o ngā mea e whai ake nei?","The correct answer is **A: auporo takitahi**.

Here's why:

* **P** states that before the Renaissance, emphasis was placed ""i roto i te mahara o te tangata kotahi"" (within the memory of the individual). This means individual memory (auporo takitahi) was very important.  The Renaissance shifted focus *away* from this, prioritizing access to and understanding of written text (""te āheinga ki te mahara ki ngā kupu"").

* **Q** asks what the Renaissance shifted focus *away from*.

Therefore, the answer is individual memorization.

Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e kore e whakaatu i te kaupapa ki te whakamahi i te ipurangi mō te haere tonu o ngā hononga?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **C: Haere rangahau**.

Ko te take:

*   E korero ana te whiti i te ""tōai whanaungatanga"" hei mea e akiaki ana te whakamahinga o te ipurangi. Ko ngā whiringa A, B, me D e whakaatu ana i ngā huarahi e taea ai e te tangata te pupuri, te hanga rānei i ngā hononga.
*   Ko te haere rangahau (whiringa C) e aro nui ana ki te tiki mōhiohio, ehara i te mea nui ki te whanaungatanga tāngata. Ahakoa ka taea e te rangahau ipurangi te arahi ki ngā whanaungatanga (hei tauira, te kimi i ngā tāngata e rite ana te ngākau nui), ehara i te mea matua.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore e whakaatu i te kaupapa ki te whakamahi i te ipurangi mō te whai wāhi whaiaro?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **D: Whakahaere moni ana.**

**He aha ai:**

*   **A: Tirohia ana he tohutohu** - He whai wāhi whaiaro tēnei, e rapu ana te tangata i ngā mōhiohio whaiaro.
*   **B: Tuku ana i runga i tētahi papa matapakinga tuihono** - He whakawhitinga kōrero tēnei me ētahi atu, he mea whaiaro hoki.
*   **C: Rangahau ana i ngā hua rongoā** - He pātai whaiaro tēnei e pā ana ki te hauora.
*   **D: Whakahaere moni ana** - He mahi tēnei e whai wāhi atu ana ki te mahi ngaio, ki te whaihua rānei, ehara i te mea whaiaro noa iho.

Ko te kōrero kei roto i te P e kōrero ana mō ngā take whaiaro e whakamahi ai te tangata i te Ipurangi pērā i te ako, te pāhekoheko, te whakauru takitahi, me te tōai whanaungatanga. Ko te whakahaere moni ehara i te mea e taka tika ana ki ēnei kāwai.

"Nō whea i mutu ai te whakawhirinaki nui o Ūropi ki ngā pānga, a, ka tīmata te whakawhanake i tōna ake kāhua?","The correct answer is **A: Puta noa i te mutunga o ngā Pakeke o Waenganui**.

The passage states that ""Tata ki te mutunga o ngā Middle Ages i tīmata a Ūropi ki te uru te whakawhanake i tā rātou ake huatau.""
"
He aha te hua o te whakamahi i ngā pātene hei whakapiri i ngā kakahu? ,"The correct answer is **C: The Crusades**.

The passage states that one of the biggest developments of the time *resulting* from the Crusades was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes. Therefore, the Crusades *caused* the adoption of buttons for clothing.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e whakaarotia ana he rongoā wā roa ki ngā take taiao?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **C: E whakaatu ana i te take o ngā take**.

Ko te wāhanga P e kī ana me ""rapu tātou i te aka o ngā raru, ā, me whakakore e tātou"" ki te kore tātou e hiahia ki te rongoā taupua noa iho. Ko te tikanga tēnei ko te whakatika i te take o ngā take he rongoā wā roa ake i te whakatika noa i ngā tohumate (pērā i te whakakotahi mo te taiao, te noho pai ake rānei).
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tehea o enei otinga e kore e kiia he maimoatanga tohu mo nga take taiao?","The correct answer is **B: Te whakakore i ngā take taketake o ngā take** (Eliminating the root causes of the issues).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that treating only the symptoms is not enough and that we must address the root causes of the problems. Eliminating the root causes is the opposite of treating just the symptoms. The other options (participating in activism, being more environmentally friendly, and considering voting for more lifestyle options) are all described as things we can do but are likely referring to treating the symptoms of the issues, not finding and addressing the causes.
"
"I roto i tehea whenua i puta ai te pakanga tuatahi i Uropi e kiia ana ko te take matua e pā ana ki te ōritetanga o te mana, kaua ki te take karakia?","The correct answer is **D: Pāniora (Spain)**.

The passage states that the War of Spanish Succession was the first war where the balance of power was the main reason for conflict. ""Spanish Succession"" refers to the succession to the throne of Spain. Therefore, the war originated in Spain.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tēhea rohe te mea pai rawa atu mō tētahi rā takutai marino?","Based on the provided text, here's the breakdown:

*   The text mentions beaches on the **North Shore** (Te Raki Paewhenua) from Long Bay to Devonport, noting they are mostly safe and shaded by pōhutukawa.
*   It also mentions **Tamaki Drive** along the **Waitemata Harbour**, including the affluent areas of **Mission Bay** and **St Heliers**. It says these beaches are sometimes crowded with families and have good cafes nearby and are safe to swim in.

Given the descriptions, while all options have merit, the text highlights **Mission Bay** and **St Heliers** as popular beaches with good amenities. The term used in the provided text is **Te Whenua o Te Mihana** for Mission Bay.

Therefore, the best answer is:

**B: Te Whenua o Te Mihana**"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, kei hea ngā āhuatanga kaukau e tino haumaru ana?","Based on the provided text, the best answer is **D: Te Moana Roa (Long Bay)**.

Here's why:

*   The text specifically mentions that the beaches on the North Shore (which includes Long Bay and Devonport) are ""ngā moana haumaru nei"" - these are safe waters.

While Devonport is also mentioned as being on the North Shore, Long Bay is named first in the range of beaches being talked about and referred to as safe for swimming.
"
"I a ia e haere ana ki te tauwāhi i whakaahuatia i roto i te wāhi, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e kiia ana he tika?","The correct answer is **A: Whakatau nui**.

Here's why:

*   The passage is a warning/reminder to be respectful at a place with immense historical significance and tragedy. The instructions emphasize the solemn nature of the site and caution against disrespectful behavior. Visiting such a place warrants serious consideration and awareness, thus, ""whakatau nui"" (great decision) is most fitting.
*   The passage explicitly forbids marking/defacing structures (""Kauka te wāhi e whakaanuanu mā te māka mā te raku i te karawhiti ki ngā hanganga.""), making option B incorrect.
*   The passage explicitly forbids making light of the Nazi atrocities (""Kaua e pukuhohe mō ngā mahi whakapoauau a ngā Nazi.""), making option C incorrect.
*   While inspecting structures may happen, the overall emphasis is on respectful conduct and understanding the gravity of the site, meaning option D, ""Te tirotiro i tētahi hanganga"" (inspecting a structure), is too narrow in scope to be the primary message."
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whakamārama ana i ngā reo lingua francas?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: Waro**.

The text states that lingua francas are languages that have developed naturally and spread or are adopted for communication between speakers of different languages. This implies that they are *not* artificially constructed or ""hori"" (fake/false in this context) or ""kua whakaritea"" (arranged/planned).

Therefore, ""waro"" (natural) best describes the characteristic of lingua francas as described in the text.
"
Ko tēhea tauākī kāore e whakaahua tika ana i ngā reo tūturu?,"The correct answer is **C: He reo hanganga hei whakapai ake i ngā tauari whakawhiti kōrero uaua.**

Here's why:

*   **P** defines auxiliary languages as artificial languages designed to facilitate communication between people who have difficulty communicating.
*   Auxiliary languages are designed for complex communication
*   A is Incorrect. Auxiliary languages are not real languages
*   B is Incorrect. Real languages are not typically created with design and are not constructed
*   D is Incorrect. Real languages are not designed languages formed between communication issues.

Therefore, Option C inaccurately describes a real language. Real languages evolve naturally and are not created to specifically address complex communication scenarios. Auxiliary languages are for complex communications.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, me aha te tirohanga pāhihi mehemea kai te hōtoke to rātau tere?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā whakaritenga visa**.

The text states: ""Kei te wātea ngā pāhihi rerenga i ngā herenga pane uruwhenua (tirohia ngā herenga)."" This translates to: ""Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check requirements).""

Therefore, if a passenger is taking a cruise, they need to check visa requirements. The passage explicitly mentions visa requirements for cruise passengers. While the first sentence mentions being careful of camping spots due to ice, this isn't something *all* passengers must consider if traveling during winter. The passage does not focus on cabin location or the amount of time spent in a city.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, mehemea kai te raumati te tere o te pāhihi, he aha pea ka taea e rātau te karo?","The correct answer is **B: E haere ana i te hukapapa**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Mēnā e whakawhiti ana koe i te awa ki Northen Baltic, tirohia ngā wāhi hōpuni i te mea ko te haere i roto i te huka he hoihoi mō te hunga ka pāngia e tērā momo mate."" (If you are crossing the river to Northern Baltic, check the camping sites because travelling through ice is boring for people who suffer from this type of illness.)
*   The question asks what a passenger travelling in the summer would likely avoid. Ice is obviously not a concern during summer.
*   The passage directly links avoiding ice travel to people who suffer from illness, implying that it's something one would want to avoid if possible."
He aha te take i whakamahia ai te reo Catalan i te nuinga o te wā mō ngā tohu me ngā panui i Barcelona?,"The correct answer is **B: Ko te reo mana tuatahi tērā o te taone** (It is the primary official language of the city).

The passage states that ""kei te tohua te nuinga o ngā tohu ki te reo Catalan anake nā te mea kua whakaūngia e te ture koirā te reo ōkawa tuatahi"" (most signs are marked in Catalan only because it is established by law as the primary official language).
"
Ko tēhea o ngā reo e whai ake nei e whakamahia ana e te pūnaha Metro o Barcelona mō ngā panui auau?,"The correct answer is **B: Catalan**.

The passage states ""Ko ngā pānui auau i te Metro e mahi noa ana ki Catalan..."" which translates to ""The regular announcements in the Metro are only done in Catalan..."".
"
"I runga anō i te haerenga, ko tēhea o ngā taonga e whai ake nei e kore pea e whakaritea e te moenga mutunga tiketike me te parakuihi?","Based on the passage, the most likely answer is **D: WiFi Tere**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage emphasizes:** High-quality B&Bs focus on luxury bedding, unique breakfasts with local and homemade ingredients, historical settings, antique furniture, beautiful grounds, and possibly a swimming pool.
*   **The passage does not mention:** WiFi. While WiFi is a common amenity, the passage is focused on elements that elevate the experience to an ""art form"" and things that will create the perception of luxury.

Therefore, while a high-end B&B might *have* fast WiFi, it's not a defining characteristic like the other options. The other options are more related to the luxury and unique experience that the passage highlights:

*   **A: Ngā tuemi tahua motuhake (Specialty menu items):** This is a direct reflection of the ""kai motuhake o te hunga kāinga"" (homemade specialties) mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: Ngā whakarato ārai motuhake (Specialty linen provisions):** Directly related to the ""moenga tīno hirahira, ākuanei pea he koti riteta i mahia ā-ringatia, he moenga nō uki rānei"" (exquisite bedding, perhaps handmade linen sheets, or antique beds).
*   **C: Kia mau tonu ngā mokowā o waho (Well-maintained outdoor spaces):** This aligns with the description of ""papa e ātaahua ana, me tētahi puna kaukau"" (beautiful grounds, and a swimming pool)."
"I runga anō i te haerenga, ko tēhea o ēnei ehara i tētahi o ngā wāhi matua o te whakataetae i waenganui i ngā B&Bs rangatira?","The correct answer is **A: Te whakapaipai o naianei (Modern decor)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the following key competitive areas for high-quality B&Bs:

*   **Exceptional bedding:** Fine linen, possibly handmade or vintage bedding.
*   **Local and seasonal breakfast offerings:** Regional delicacies or homemade specialties.
*   **Location and atmosphere:** Historic building, antique furnishings, beautiful grounds, maybe a pool.
*   **High end property**

The passage doesn't prioritize **modern decor** as a key element. While aesthetics are important, the emphasis is on a historic, unique, or charming atmosphere, rather than necessarily modern design. Therefore, it is not one of the main areas of competition between top B&Bs based on the passage.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e kore e puritia ki Beijing i te tau 2022?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā takahanga rohe reti Taizicheng**.

The passage states that the skiing events are in Taizicheng, which is about 220 km from Beijing. The passage indicates that the rest of the options are being held in Beijing.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei ka taurimatia e Beijing i te tau 2022?","The correct answer is **B: Ko nga takahanga hukapapa e tū ana i rō whare**.

The passage states: ""Mā Beijing e noho hei hau kāinga mō ngā hui tuwhera, aukati anō hoki, me ngā mahi tio ki rō whare."" This translates to ""Beijing will be home to the opening ceremonies, closing ceremonies, and indoor ice events.""
"
Ko wai te tino mate ka pa ki te rewharewha avian?,"E tika ana ko te whakautu **C: Ngā kaimahi Poultry**.

Ko te kōrero e kī ana ko te nuinga o ngā tāngata kua pangia e te rewharewha manu ko rātou e mahi ana me ngā manu pāmu. Ko te ""Poultry"" te kupu Ingarihi mō ngā manu pāmu.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā tauākī e whai ake nei e whakamārama tika ana i te rewharewha manu?","The best answer is **C: Kei te mōrearea te hunga mātakitaki manu kia mate**.

Here's why:

*   **P states:** ""...heoi tērā pea ka mōrearea hoki ki te hunga mātaki manu."" This translates to ""...however, it may also be dangerous for bird watchers."" This directly supports option C.

Let's examine why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ko ngā kaimahi manu anake kua pāngia e te rewharewha** (Only bird workers have been affected by the flu). P states ""Ko te nuinga kua pā ki ngā tāngata e mahi nei me ngā manu pāmu..."" (Most cases have affected people who work with farm birds...), but it doesn't say *only* bird workers are affected.
*   **B: He nui ake ngā take i pūrongotia i te tangata i te manu** (There are more cases reported in humans than in birds). The passage states the opposite - it has affected birds and mammals, with only under a thousand reported human cases.
*   **D: Ko ngā take katoa i pūrongotia i te tangata i mate** (All cases reported in humans have resulted in death). P states ""...engari ko ētahi kua mate"" (...but some have died). This indicates that not all human cases are fatal."
He aha te mea e hono ana i te Moana Pākehā-Baltic Canal?,"The correct answer is **C: Moana o te Moana o Te Moana me te Moana Baltic**

The passage states: ""Ka hono te White Sea-Baltic Canal i te Arctic Ocean ki te Baltic Sea...""
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te momo waka ka kohia pea ngā uruwhenua kia kore ai e haukoti i te pāhihi?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā tereina moe pō**.

The passage explicitly states that on overnight sleeper trains, passports are collected by the train attendant so passengers are not disturbed while sleeping.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, āhea pea ka tirohia tō ID i ētahi tereina taitapa?","The correct answer is **A: I muri iho i te whakakotahitanga i te tereina**

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Ka whakawātia ētahi tereina whakawhiti-rohe mā te tereina e haruru ana, ā, me whai tāutunga i tō ekenga ki tētahi o ēnei tereina."" which translates to ""Some cross-border trains are judged by rumbling trains, and you must have your credentials when boarding one of these trains.""
*   This sentence indicates that identification (ID) is checked or required when you get on the train. Thus, after boarding the train, your ID will be checked.
*   The other options are incorrect because the passage states that on overnight sleeper trains, passports are collected by the train attendant so you are not disturbed while sleeping, not on other trains. The passage also does not state that ID's will never be checked on trains."
Ko tēhea o ngā take e whai ake nei ka tino puta ake i te wā e noho ana i te rohe teitei o Singapore?,"The correct answer is **C: E pāngia ana te rongoā wera** (Being affected by heat stroke).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Singapore's location near the equator means you're always affected by heat. Heat stroke is a direct consequence of being exposed to excessive heat.
*   The passage directly implies the heat can be overwhelming (""pāngia koe e te wera (i ngā wā katoa)"").

The other options are incorrect because:

*   A: Kei te tore (Being lost). The passage doesn't talk about this. It focuses on the weather effects on health.
*   B: Kāore he āheitanga ki ngā toa (No access to shops). The passage says the opposite (""e taea ana e koe te nuinga o ngā mea te hoko i muri i te taenga atu"").
*   D: Kua ngaro (Being lost). It is synonymous with 'A', making it unlikely to be the correct answer."
Ko wai e kore e pai ki te kai i ngā keke Tiamana?,"Based on the passage, many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Therefore, someone with a severe nut allergy would likely not enjoy German pastries.

The correct answer is **A: Ko tētahi tangata whai nati tino nui** (Someone with a severe nut allergy).
"
Ko tehea te kai e kiia ana he huānga o te wā o ngā keke Tiamana?,"The correct answer is **C: Paramu**.

The passage states: ""...ka kitea ngā tiere, ngā paramu i te wā o te raumati"" which translates to ""...jams and plums are found in the summertime."" This implies plums are a seasonal ingredient in German cakes, specifically during summer.
"
"I runga anō i te haerenga, ko tēhea o ēnei ehara i te aki tūtohu mo te haere i runga i te tahua?","The correct answer is **C: Tono tāngata mō te moni**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that it **does not** condone begging or taking advantage of others' generosity. Begging for money directly contradicts the principles outlined.
*   The other options are aligned with the passage's theme of budget travel:
    *   **A: Kimihia ngā mahi rerekē hei mahi i roto i ō haerenga** : It implies trying new experiences when traveling.
    *   **B: Kia ngāwari ki tō taumata whakamarie**:The passage says to sacrifice comfort to make things more affordable.
    *   **D: Whakaitihia nga whakapaunga penei i te kai me te noho:** This aligns with the core idea of minimizing expenses to travel on a low budget."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, tērā pea he uaua te haere i runga i te tahua iti rawa?","The correct answer is **A: Ko tētahi tangata e pōhiri ana i tētahi uaua**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Mō te hunga e pai ana ki te whakahere i te āhuru, i te wā, i te āhei ki te matapae hoki kia whakaheke i ngā utu tata atu ki te kore, tirohia te hāereere tahua pūtea itinga iho."" This translates to: ""For those who are willing to sacrifice comfort, time, and predictability to reduce costs to almost nothing, consider extreme budget travel.""
*   Sacrificing comfort, time, and predictability implies that the person is accepting some level of difficulty or inconvenience, which aligns with ""pōhiri ana i tētahi uaua"" (welcoming hardship)."
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e kore e tino whakaahua i te waka i waenganui i Point Marion me Fairmont?,"The correct answer is **C: Āhua kore nei e piri ana ngā tepe tere ki**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the speed limits are lower (35-40 mph) and that it's *very important* to follow them. Therefore, the statement ""āhua kore nei e piri ana ngā tepe tere ki"" (speed limits are not strictly adhered to) is directly contradicted by the passage.

The other options are supported by the passage:

*   A: ""He roa nga whārōrō o te huarahi whenua mamao"" - The passage describes it as going ""mā ngā whenua wao mohoao"" (through wild, wooded lands), which supports the idea of a long and remote stretch.
*   B: ""He kikī nga Lanes"" - The passage mentions ""ngā huarahi whāiti"" (narrow roads).
*   D: ""Ko te tikanga kia kaua te ratonga waea pūkoro e take"" - The passage explicitly states that phone service is stronger here compared to other sections.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei he tino māharahara mo nga atekōkiri e haere ana i runga i te huarahi Buffalo-Pittsburg?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **C: Kia tere rawa te huri koi**.

E kī ana te kōrero he nui ngā paripari, ngā huarahi whāiti, me ngā kokonga koki tāhapa. Ko ēnei āhuatanga ka nui te mōrearea ki te huri koe i te tere rawa. Kāore e kī ana te kōrero mō ngā waka taumaha, te ratonga pūkoro, ngā mahi huarahi rānei.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e kore e hiahiatia hei tīmata i te hīkoi?,"The correct answer is **B: Te āhua ōkiko o Peak (Peak physical condition)**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that canyoneering combines swimming, climbing, and jumping.
*   The passage also states that canyoneering does **not** require peak fitness or extensive training.
*   The passage implies that ability to swim and jump is necessary for canyoneering.

Therefore, peak physical condition is the one thing that is **not** required to start canyoneering, according to the passage."
Ko tehea o ēnei e hiahiatia ana hei haerenga pai ki te awaawa?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: Kei te kaha te tiki**.

The passage states that canyoneering ""combines aspects of swimming, climbing, and jumping -- but doesn't necessarily require extreme fitness or extensive training."" This suggests that a moderate level of fitness (""kei te kaha te tiki"") is important.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Āheinga athletic arā atu anō** - While fitness is helpful, the passage explicitly says that *extreme* fitness isn't required.
*   **B: I mua i te wheako me te ruku scuba** - Scuba diving experience is not mentioned as necessary.
*   **C: He tiwhikete i roto i te tangata e whai ana** - Certification is not mentioned in the passage.

Therefore, the best answer is **D**."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te āwhina ki tētahi tangata e whakaaro ana ki te hopuni i roto i to rātau motokā?","The best answer is **B: He waka e āhei ai nga tūru ki te whakatakoto.**

The passage states: ""Ka taea te hopuni ā-waka mehemea he wākena rahi, he SUV, he Sedan, he Station Wagon rānei tāu me ngā tūru ka taea te whakatakoto."" This directly says that having seats that can be laid down is a requirement for car camping. While A, C, and D might be helpful, they are not explicitly mentioned as being essential for car camping in the provided text.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha pea e hiahia ana ngā puni motokā ki te karo mehemea kei te kimi rātau ki te noho i raro i te hihiani?","The correct answer is **C: Te whakatū teneti i te tāone, i te whenua tūmataiti rānei**.

The passage states that setting up a tent in a city or on private land will undoubtedly attract unwanted attention (""kāore e kore ka tae mai ngā titiro kikino""). This implies that to stay discreet while car camping, one should avoid this. The passage implies SUVs, Sedans, or Station Wagons with seats that lay down are needed to camp from a car. Therefore A cannot be correct. B and D are not alluded to at all.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, nāna i hanga anō a Casablanca i te tuarua o nga wā?","The correct answer is **D: Te sultan o Morocco**.

The passage states: ""I hangaia anō e te sultan o Marako te tāone nui hei Daru I-Badya, ā, i tapaina ki te ingoa o Casablanca e ngā kaihokohoko Pāniora..."" which translates to ""The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by the Spanish merchants..."" This indicates the sultan rebuilt the city after it was abandoned following an earthquake.
"
Ko wai i whakarere i te taone hou o Casablanca i muri i tētahi aitua māori?,"The correct answer is **B: Te Potukara (The Portuguese)**.

The passage states that the Portuguese destroyed the town (Anfa), rebuilt it as Casa Branca, and then abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i pēhea te whiwhi āhukahuka a Sintra i waenganui i nga manene?","The correct answer is **C: Ngā arotakenga tōrunga a Te Ariki Byron**.

The passage states that Sintra ""rongonui ai ki te hunga rāwaho i muri i te kōrero kauanuanu mō āna ātanga nā Lord Byron i tuhi"" which translates to ""became famous among foreigners after the admiring account of its charms written by Lord Byron.""
"
He aha te mea kāore i te mōhiotia e Armenia?,"The correct answer is **D: Te whenua hou (The new country)**.

The passage states that no recognized country, *including Armenia*, recognizes the new country formed in Nagorno-Karabakh. Therefore, the existence and status of the new country are not acknowledged by Armenia.
"
He aha te mea e pā tonu ana ki ngā whanaungatanga i waenganui i Azerbaijan me Armenia?,"The correct answer is **D: Rohe Nagorno-Karabakh** (The Nagorno-Karabakh region).

The passage explicitly states that the territorial disputes over the Nagorno-Karabakh region are ongoing and continue to strain relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
"
"I a ia e mau ana i tētahi teka i Charlotte, he aha pea ka āhei ki tētahi utu tāpiri?","The correct answer is **B: Tokotoru nga pāhihi**.

The passage states: ""He utu āpiti mō te whai i te nui ake i te 2 pāhihi..."" (There is an additional charge for having more than 2 passengers...). Therefore, having three passengers could result in an additional charge.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea e whakaarotia ana he kōaro ki te noho i Charlotte me nga tamariki?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: E ngana ana ki te hākinakina i te taone** (Trying to use taxis in the city).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that families in Charlotte don't often use taxis because the extra charge for more than two passengers can make it expensive. This implies that using taxis (for transportation) is a *disadvantage* or drawback for families. The other options are either positive aspects of Charlotte or not mentioned in the context of being a disadvantage for families."
"I mua i te taenga mai o nga Paniora, ko wai i whakahaere i te taha raki o Chile?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: pus**.

The passage states: ""I mua i te taenga mai o te Paniora i te rautau 16, i raro a Chile ki te raki i te mana o Inca"" - This means that **before the Spanish arrived, the northern part of Chile was under the control of the Inca**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mapuche** - The Mapuche lived in central and southern Chile, not the north.
*   **B: Americans** - Americans were not involved in Chile before the Spanish arrival in the 16th century.
*   **C: Araucanians** - This is the same as Mapuche, and they lived in central and southern Chile.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i puta i te tau kotahi mano 1810?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **B: I tutuki i a Chile te wikitōria i runga i te Pāniora**.

E ai ki te kōrero, ahakoa i tū motuhake a Chile i te tau 1810, kāore i tino wikitoria ki ngā Pāniora tae rawa ki te tau 1818. Ko te toenga o ngā kōwhiringa i puta katoa i te tau 1810.
"
Me pēhea e tae ai te tangata ki nga kāinga mamao i te rohe o Liguria?,"The passage states: ""Kei te honohono ngā ara, ngā tereina, ngā pōti hoki i ngā kāinga, ā, e kore e taea e ngā waka te tae atu ki reira mai i waho.""

This means the villages are connected by paths, trains, and boats, but cars cannot access them from outside.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Mā te tereina, poti rānei** (By train or boat).
"
He aha te kōrero a te kupu Itari 'Cinque Terre'?,"The correct answer is **A: E rima nga kāinga**.

The passage states: ""Ko Cinque Terre, ko te tikanga ko Ngā Whenua e Rima, ko ngā kāinga tai paku e rima..."" which translates to ""Cinque Terre, which means Five Lands, are the five small coastal villages...""
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea momo whakaara e tika ana mō ngā āhuatanga o te hōtoke māniania?","The correct answer is **B: Whakaara me ngā taputapu tāpae**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically mentions ""taputapu whao tāpiri mō ngā āhuatanga pāremoremo, e tika ana mō te nuinga o ngā hū, ngā pūtu rānei"". This translates to ""add-on crampon devices for slippery conditions, suitable for most shoes or boots"". These are effectively ""taputapu tāpae"".

Let's eliminate the other options:

*   A: Whakaara me ngā rekereke whāiti (Footwear with narrow heels): The passage states ""Me pāpaku, me whānui ngā rekereke"" (""Heels should be shallow and wide"") - contradicting this option.
*   C: Whakaara me ngā rekereke tiketike (Footwear with high heels): The passage states ""Me pāpaku, me whānui ngā rekereke"" (""Heels should be shallow and wide"") - contradicting this option.
*   D: Ngā whakaara me te kore tauira hōhonu 1/5 inihi (Footwear without a tread depth of 1/5 inch): The passage states ""Me rawaka te hōhonu o te tauira, 5 mm (1/5 inihi) neke atu rānei"" (""The pattern depth should be sufficient, 5 mm (1/5 inch) or more"") - contradicting this option."
Ko tēhea o ēnei e kore e āwhina ki te whakapai ake i te pūngao i runga i ngā huarahi hukarere i te wā o te hotoke?,"The correct answer is **D: Wai (Water)**.

The passage mentions sand, gravel, and salt as ways to improve grip on icy roads. Water, on the other hand, would freeze and make the situation worse.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kōrero e ōrite ana ki a Hawaii me ngā Moutere o Cook?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka tiria e rātou te rohe wā ōrite** (They share the same time zone).

The passage states: ""E ōrite ana te wāhi wā ki tā hawaii..."" (The time zone is the same as Hawaii). Therefore, option C is the only one that accurately reflects information given in the passage."
Ko tēhea o ēnei kōrero e kore e tika te whakaahua i ngā Moutere o Cook?,"The correct answer is **C: Ko nga tāone matua ko Rarotonga me Aitutaki**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Kāore i ngā Kuki Airani he tāone nui, engari 15 ōna motu. Ko ngā motu matua ko Rarotonga me Aitutaki."" which translates to ""The Cook Islands do not have large cities, but 15 of its islands. The main islands are Rarotonga and Aitutaki."" Rarotonga and Aitutaki are the main islands, not the main cities.
*   The other options are correct:
    *   A: The passage doesn't explicitly say they are smaller than Hawaii. However, the fact that they are referred to as """"Hawaii ki raro"""" suggest they are smaller.
    *   B: A pūranga (archipelago) means a group of islands, which the Cook Islands are.
    *   D: The passage states, ""E ōrite ana te wāhi wā ki tā hawaii"" meaning ""The time zone is the same as Hawaii."""
Ko tēhea o ngā teihana ranger e whai ake nei e tuku ana i ngā momo noho e rua?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

The passage states that ""Sirena anake te teihana whare kaitiaki e tuku ana i te wharenoho rūma moe, te noho me ngā kai wera hei tāpiritanga ki te pūpahi."" This means Sirena offers both camping (pūpahi) and other forms of accommodation (wharenoho rūma moe, noho). The other stations only offer camping.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ka taea e koe te rāhui i tētahi haerengapāka mēnā e hiahia ana koe ki te whakamahi moni, kaua ko te hua?","The correct answer is **C: CafeNet El Sol**.

The text mentions ""CafeNet El Sol is offering a booking service for a fee of $US30, or $10 for single-day tickets"". This implies that they provide a service to arrange park permits, which you would likely pay for using money.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Sirena:** This is a ranger station, not a service for booking permits.
*   **Puerto Jiménez:** This is where you can get forest permits, but they don't accept credit cards, implying the need for money.
*   **La Leona:** This is just a campsite."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te momo reti e mahia ana i te whenua poupou ake?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **C: Kāhua Alpine**.

E ai ki te kōrero, ko te reti āhua maunga, te piki maunga rānei e mahia ana ki ngā wāhi paripari, ā, ka hiahiatia ngā reti me ngā pūtu māro ake. Ko te reti kāhua Alpine te ingoa mō te reti ki ngā wāhi paripari.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha pea ka āwhina ki te whakahoki i ngā reti whenua e hiahia ana ki te tae ki ngā tere teitei ake?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā pūtu Stiffer**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that backcountry skiing, when done in steeper areas, ""requires stiffer skis and boots."" Stiffer boots are therefore associated with more challenging terrain and, implicitly, higher speeds as one would likely be descending steeper slopes.
*   The passage states in some cases you can reach speeds of ski skating if you do not have a heavy pack on groomed trails. Therefore, B cannot be true.
*   There is no mention of binding or groomed trails helping to obtain higher speeds, making C and D false."
He uaua ki te mahi i te aha te hunga e haere ana e pā ana ki te whakaoho i te hokinga mai?,"Based on the provided text, the answer is **B: He manawanui, he mātauranga hoki**.

The passage explicitly states that people may not realize that patience and understanding are also valuable for travelers returning home. Therefore, providing patience and understanding is something that people find difficult to do when dealing with returning travelers.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, He uaua rawa pea te pāwera o te hokinga mai anō mō te momo tangata haere?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā haere i tere te whakatika i a rātau e noho ana ki rāwāhi** (Travelers who quickly adapt while living abroad).

Here's why:

*   **The passage emphasizes the difficulty of *re-entry shock*.** It states that re-entry shock can be faster, longer, and possibly worse than culture shock. It also says people who easily adapt to new cultures sometimes have trouble adapting back home.

*   **Option B aligns with this idea.** If a traveler easily and quickly adapts to a new culture abroad, the passage implies that they may find it more challenging to readjust to their original culture upon returning. The ease of adapting in the first place can make the reverse adjustment more jarring.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei me karo te tangata i te mahi i te moose?,"Based on the provided passage, the moose becomes dangerous when someone gets too close because they underestimate the potential danger. Therefore, the best answer is:

**C: Whakamōkito ana i tō rātou taumata tuma tūpono (Underestimating their potential threat)**

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: E mōhio ana ki to rātau aroaro (Knowing their presence):** Being aware of a moose isn't necessarily dangerous, it's about what you do next.
*   **B: He pōturi rawa te haere (Moving too slowly):** The speed is not the main danger of a moose. You are at risk getting too close, regardless of if you move fast or slow.
*   **D: E mātaki ana i a rātou i tētahi tawhiti (Watching them from a distance):** Watching from a distance is a safe thing to do, not something to avoid.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki te moose ehara i te tika?","The correct answer is **A: He kararehe whakatuki noa rātau**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that moose aren't usually aggressive, but *will* fight if threatened. This directly contradicts the statement that they are ""always peaceful"" or ""always docile"".

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

*   **B: I ētahi wā kāore rātau i te mōhiotia he tuma tūpono:** The passage says that people might not recognize the potential danger of a moose and get too close.
*   **C: Ka taea e rātau te whakaohokia e ngā tāngata e tata ana ki a rātau:** The passage says people can get too close and put themselves in danger.
*   **D: Ka tiaki rātau i a rātau anō mehemea e hiahiatia ana:** The passage says moose will fight if they are in trouble."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei te iti rawa o te mōrearea mo te haere koraha?","Based on the passage, here's why the answer is **A: Te kore kakahu mahana i te pō makariri (The lack of warm clothing in the cold night)**:

*   **The passage explicitly states that hypothermia (hauhauaitu) is a real danger if one lacks warm clothing at night in the desert.** This directly links the lack of warm clothing to a significant risk.

The other options are about mirages:

*   **B: Te kite i te mirage e tuku ana i te whakaaro o te wai (Seeing a mirage that gives the idea of water):** Seeing a mirage itself isn't inherently dangerous.
*   **C: E whai ana i te pūngao i a ia e whai ana i te mirage (Expending energy while chasing a mirage):** The passage states that following a mirage wastes valuable energy.
*   **D: E horoi ana i te wai i a ia e whai ana i te mirage (Depleting water while chasing a mirage):** The passage states that following a mirage wastes water.

Therefore, the most direct and clearly stated danger from the passage is the risk of hypothermia due to lack of warm clothing at night. So the answer is A."
Ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i kōrerotia hei tuma tūpono mō ngā haere koraha?,"The correct answer is **D: Tātahu**.

The passage mentions:

*   **Iti wai:** Implied as chasing mirages wastes water.
*   **Mirages:** Explicitly stated as a potential danger.
*   **Hypothermia:** Explicitly stated as a potential danger due to cold desert nights.

""Tātahu"" (beach) is not mentioned in the passage as a threat.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea te iwi whānui o te rōpū i tino pāngia i muri i te taenga mai o nga kaitoro?","The correct answer is C: Te Taínos.

The passage states that after the arrival of the Europeans, the Tainos were decimated by the Spanish conquistadors. According to Fray Bartolome de las Casas, approximately 100,000 Tainos were killed by Spanish soldiers between 1492 and 1498.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea te reo i kōrerotia e nga Caribes?","The correct answer is **D: Arawakan**.

The passage states ""He hunga kōrero-Arawakan ngā Caribes"". This translates to ""The Caribes were Arawakan speakers"".
"
Ko wai e taea te tāwere ki te hīrere e paingia ana hei mahi whakangahau?,"According to the passage, the answer is **A: Ski bums**.

The passage states: ""He hanga haerere te retireti me ngā tini tāngata hikaka, e mōhiotia whānuitia ki te """"reti nono"""", te whakarite i ngā hararei reti i tētahi wāhi motuhake."" This translates to ""Skiing is increasingly popular, with many enthusiasts, widely known as ""ski bums"", organizing skiing holidays at a specific location.""
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te wā i mōhiotia tuatahitia ai he tākaro?","The correct answer is **D: Te rau tau 17**.

The text states: ""Mai i te rautau tua 17, neke atu rānei, te whakaretireti whakaheke hei hākinakina..."" which translates to ""From the 17th century onwards, skiing downhill became a sport...""
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e pā ana ki te motu nui rawa atu i te takutai o Awherika ki te rawhiti?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko:

**C: Waiora**

I roto i te kōrero, e kīia ana ko Marakāhia (Madagascar) te motu nui rawa atu i te Moana Īniana, ā, he paparahi ki tōna kotahi e hāngai ana ki ngā kararehe mohoao. Ko te kupu ""waiora"" he whakamāoritanga pai mō te kupu ""wilderness"", e hāngai ana ki te āhua o Marakāhia.
"
He aha te mea ehara i te āhuatanga o ngā motu iti o Awherika ki te Rāwhiti? ,"The correct answer is **B: He maha nga tauranga whai hua (They have many profitable ports)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the smaller islands are either independent nations or associated with France, have a reputation as luxury beach holiday destinations, and have a history of Islamic influence. There is no reference to many profitable ports."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he pēhea te hākari a te Aranga e ētahi hāhi tūturu?","The correct answer is **B: E taurima ana i tētahi whakatūpato pō Hātarei (Holding a vigil on Saturday night)**.

The passage states: ""Ko ngā whare karakia tūturu ake o mua ka mau tonu ki te Easter Vigil i te pō o te Hatarei i te wā o te mutunga wiki Aranga..."" which translates to ""The more traditional churches still hold the Easter Vigil on Saturday night of Easter weekend...""
"
"Hei karo i ētahi whakaritenga ina tomo ki Ecuador, me whai aha tētahi tangata whenua Cuban i te tuatahi?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **B: He reta tono ā-ture**.

Ko te kōrero e kī ana: ""Kei te here a Ekuatoa i ngā kainoho nō Kiupa kia riro i a rātou tētahi reta tono i mua i te uru atu ki Ekuatoa... Me whakature tēnei reta e te Ministry of Foreign Affairs ki Ekuatoa.""

Ahakoa e hāngai ana ētahi atu kōwhiringa ki te kōrero, ko te reta tono ā-ture te whakaritenga tuatahi me whai te tangata whenua Kiupa i mua i te whakaaro ki ētahi atu whakaritenga.
"
He aha ngā whakaritenga haere a Ecuador kāore i hoahoatia?,"The correct answer is **A: Kei te pupuri i te maha o ngā haere ki te mōkito.**

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses requirements like visas, passport validity, return tickets, and legalized letters of invitation.
*   The passage states that the restrictions have been designed to keep scheduled flights going.
*   The passage states to be able to verify one's trip length.
*   The passage dictates valid passport requirements.
*   The passage **does not** mention anything about limiting the number of trips someone can take.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei ka nui ake te utu i te whenua ke i te kāinga?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngā tāpare mutunga-teitei** (High-end frames).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that even if you get an eye exam covered by insurance at home, and take the prescription elsewhere, *high-end frames* (specifically name-brand) in poorer countries may be expensive (or fake).

The other options are less likely to be more expensive abroad:

*   **A: Ngā whakamātautau whatu** (Eye exams): The passage mentions getting an eye exam at home (and covered by insurance), implying it's the cheaper option.
*   **C: inihua kitenga** (Vision insurance): Insurance itself wouldn't be purchased in another country to make sense in this context.
*   **D: Ngā tāpare ingoa-kore** (Non-name-brand frames): The passage specifically mentions the issue of *high-end, name-brand frames* being either expensive or fake. Non-name-brand frames would likely be cheaper abroad.

Therefore, high-end frames are the only option directly mentioned as potentially costing *more* in a foreign country."
He aha ngā mōrearea ka taea e te hoko i ngā anga teitei i tētahi whenua kē?,"The best answer based on the given text is **C: He rūpahu pea** (They might be fake).

Here's why:

*   The passage directly states: ""E rua pea ngā raru o ngā anga ingoa-parani nui te kounga e wātea ana ki ngā rohe pērā; ko ētahi he tāruatanga noa iho..."" which translates to ""There may be two problems with high-quality branded frames available in such regions; some are just imitations..."" This directly supports the idea that the frames might be fake.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: E hiahiatia ana pea tētahi whakamātautau whatu tāpiri** (An additional eye exam might be needed): While getting an eye exam elsewhere is mentioned in the premise, the question asks about *buying expensive frames*. An additional eye exam isn't a *risk* specifically related to the *frames themselves*.
*   **B: Kāore pea te rongoā i te tika mō ētahi tāpare** (The prescription might not be right for some frames): This is a general concern when choosing frames, but not a specific *risk* related to buying high-end frames in another country.
*   **D: Kāore pea te Inihua e taupoki i te utu** (Insurance might not cover the cost): The premise mentions insurance coverage for the eye exam, but it doesn't imply that insurance *definitely* won't cover the frames purchased overseas. The text implies only that the cost of frames may be higher in other countries than at home.

Therefore, the most direct and supported answer is **C**."
"E pā ana ki te whakamahi moni i nga Moutere o Falklands, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e tika ana?","The correct answer is **D: I tua atu i te pauna o Falkland, ko te pauna o Ingarangi te moni tino whakaaetia**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Ko ngā kāri nama me ngā pauna Ingarangi anake e whakaaetia ana i runga i ngā motu tawhiti:** Incorrect. The text says credit cards may *not* be accepted on outer islands, and that US dollars *might* be accepted.
*   **B: Ko Stanley anake te wāhi e whakaae ana ki te tāra o Amerika:** Incorrect. The text says US dollars *might* be accepted on outer islands as well.
*   **C: Me whakawhiti nga pauna o Falkland i muri i te mahue i nga motu:** Incorrect. The text says Falkland pounds cannot be exchanged *outside* the islands, so you must exchange them *before* leaving.
*   **D: I tua atu i te pauna o Falkland, ko te pauna o Ingarangi te moni tino whakaaetia:** Correct. The text states that British pounds are ""widely accepted throughout the islands."""
"I runga anō i te wāhanga nei, ina haere ana ki nga Moutere o Falklands mai i te United States, i hea ka tino whai hua ai tētahi momo utu i tua atu i te kāri nama?","The correct answer is **C: I nga moutere o waho**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that credit cards might not be accepted in the outer islands.
*   While British and US currency might be accepted, it's ""on a case-by-case basis,"" meaning cash would be beneficial to have.
*   The text mentions British Pounds, but not US dollars, being widely accepted throughout the islands, so US dollars could be most beneficial in the outer islands in addition to a credit card.
*   The passage explicitly mentions that while credit cards and US dollars are widely accepted in Stanley, they may not be on the outer islands.
"
Ko tehea huihuinga e kore e honoa ki te whakanui i nga hakari o te temepara?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **A: Te whānautanga o te arewhana**.

E ai ki te kōrero, ko ngā huihuinga e whai pānga ana ki ngā hakari o te temepara ko:

*   Te huritau o te temepara
*   Te rā whānau o te Atua
*   Ngā takahanga nui e pā ana ki te temepara

Karekau he kōrero e pā ana ki te whānautanga o te arewhana hei kaupapa whakanui."
Ki hea kitea ai ngā arewhana rākaitia?,"The best answer is **C: I roto i nga hāereere i nga hākari o te temepara**. Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly links decorated elephants to temple festivals (hākari o te temepara) and processions (hāereere).**
* A: ""I ngā wāhi katoa mai i te mutunga o Whiringa-ā-rangi ki waenganui o Mei"" is incorrect because it only mentions the time frame, not the location of the elephants.
* B: ""I roto i nga temepara"" is too broad. While the festivals happen at temples, the elephants are specifically seen in processions.
* D: ""I nga tiriti o Kerala"" is also too broad. While the processions might go on streets, the core of the activity is related to the temple festivals."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tēhea o ngā mea e whai ake nei te huarahi tino tika ki te whakaora moni i runga i ngā tīkiti rererangi o te umanga, o te akomanga tuatahi rānei?","E ai ki te kōrero, ""Kāore he paku take o te rapu noa i ngā hekenga utu mō ngā tūru pakihi, karaehe-tuatahi rānei ki ngā rerenga tōtika i A ki B."" Ko te tikanga o tēnei, ehara i te mea he whai hua te kimi i ngā whakahekenga utu.

Engari, ko te kōrero e kī ana ko te huarahi tino mārakerake ki te eke ki ngā tūru rangatira (pēnei i te umanga, karaehe tuatahi) ko te hoatu i tētahi moni mātotoru ki te hunga whairawa, ""ka pai ake mēnā ka taea e tō kamupene te mahi māu"".

Nā reira, ko te whakautu tika ko:

**A: Kei te utu mā tō kamupene**
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te moumou wā hei rapu ina tāpui i ētahi akoranga utu?","The correct answer is **C: Ngā Whakahekenga**.

The passage states: ""I te nuinga o te wā, kāore he paku take o te rapu noa i ngā hekenga utu mō ngā tūru pakihi, karaehe-tuatahi rānei ki ngā rerenga tōtika i A ki B."" This directly translates to ""In most cases, there is no point in simply looking for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B."" Thus, searching for discounts is a waste of time.
"
He aha te mea e kore e hiahiatia kia tāpirihia ina whakataurite ana i te utu katoa mō Āwherika me te utu huri noa i te ao?,"The correct answer is **B: Te utu o ngā takoha haerenga i Āwherika**

The passage says to *add* visa costs, departure taxes, and ground arrangements for locations *outside* of Africa. The question asks what should *not* be added. Since the passage implies these extra expenses are only needed for locations outside of Africa, then it's reasonable to assume the cost of travel taxes in Africa do not need to be added because they will be applied to both trips if you visit Africa on both.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha ngā hokomaha e tīmata ana ki te tuku i tētahi tīpakonga rerekē ake?","The correct answer is **A: Kai kua rite**

The passage states: ""Kei te piki haere te whiwhi o ngā hokomaha i te kōwhiringa whānui ake o ngā kai kua whakaritea kētia."" which translates to: ""Supermarkets are increasingly offering a wider selection of pre-prepared foods.""
"
He aha ngā mea e whakaratohia ana e ētahi toa hokohoko e pai ai ki te kiritaki e hoko ana i ngā kai kua oti te hanga?,"The correct answer is **D: He oumu ngaruiti** and **A: Nga wharekai kei runga i te waahi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""Kei ētahi he ngaruiti, he mea kē rānei hei whakamahana kai"" (Some have microwaves or something else to heat food).
* The passage also states that ""Ki ētahi whenua, momo toa rānei kei reira tētahi wharekai ki taua wāhi tonu"" (In some countries or types of stores there is a restaurant on site).

The other options are incorrect:

*   B: Tīpakonga rerekē iti iho (Less diverse selection) - The passage says the opposite, that supermarkets are increasing their selection of prepared foods.
*   C: Ngā kai mata (Raw food) - While supermarkets sell raw food, this isn't specifically related to the convenience of buying *prepared* food. The question asks what makes it easier for a customer to buy prepared food."
Ko tēhea o ēnei kōrero e kore e mārama ki ngā Pirihi me ngā Swiss e kōrero ana i te reo Wīwī?,"The passage states that Belgians and Swiss who speak French are taught standard French in school, so they are familiar with the standard French numbering system. The passage also states that they use different numbering systems in Belgium and Switzerland. However, because of schooling, they should know the standard system.

Therefore, the answer is:

*   **A: Te pūnaha tau Wīwī paerewa** (The standard French numbering system).

The other options are not correct, as the passage mentions the nuances of speech in Belgium and Switzerland."
"Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei, kāore i te ōrite i Wīwī me te mea kei Wīwī, i Pīkihi rānei?","The correct answer is **C: Ko te reo Wīwī paerewa e whakaakona ana i ngā kura**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Belgians and Swiss learn standard French (""te tūapapa ki te Wīwi"") in school. This means that the standard French taught in schools *is* consistent between the countries.
*   The passage explicitly states that the number system (""te pūnaha tatau"") and pronunciation of some words differ between Belgium/Switzerland and France. While it doesn't directly mention spelling, it does talk about how the dialects differ from one another. That means that **B** and **D** do not match in those different countries
*   While not directly mentioned, the passage does indicate the French dialect spoken in these countries is different from France. That indicates that **A** does not match.

Therefore, only option C remains consistent between France and Belgium."
I roto i tehea āhuatanga kaore pea koe e whakawhiwhia ki te utu mo te mate?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **C: Mēnā kei te rere koe me Lufthansa mai i Paris ki te United States**.

He aha ai:

E ai ki te kōrero i te P, ka tuku a Lufthansa i ngā utu tangihanga mō ngā haerenga ka taea mai i U.S i Kānata rānei. Ki te haere mai i Paris ki te U.S, kaore e tutuki i tenei whakaritenga.

Ko ētahi atu kōwhiringa:

*   **A:** Kua whakahuatia a WestJet he rererangi e tuku utu tangihanga ana.
*   **B:** Ko te whakarite mā te waea tōtika atu ki te kamupene rererangi e tika ana mō ngā utu tangihanga.
*   **D:** Kua whakahuatia a Delta he rererangi e tuku utu tangihanga ana."
He aha te pono mo nga utu whakangahau?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is:

**D: Me tono tika ki te kamupene rererangi mā te waea**

The text explicitly states that you must arrange these fares by calling the airline directly.
"
He aha te wā e pai ake ai te whakamahi i tētahi pūrere GPS motuhake i tētahi taupānga whakatere GPS?,"The correct answer is **C: Ina puta koe i te awhe**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that a limitation of using GPS apps on your smartphone is that their functionality may be limited or unavailable if you don't have a data connection or are out of range. This means a dedicated GPS device would be better in situations where you might not have data coverage.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: Ina ngana koe ki te tiaki moni:** The passage claims that using GPS apps on smartphones is more economical than buying new maps for a GPS device, purchasing a dedicated GPS device, or renting one from a rental car company.
*   **B: Ina mōhio koe ka whai hononga raraunga koe:** If you know you'll have a data connection, a GPS app is suitable, so a dedicated device isn't necessarily better in this case.
*   **D: Ina kāore koe e hiahia ki te rēti i tētahi pūrere:** The passage claims that using GPS apps on smartphones is more economical than renting a GPS device from a rental car company."
He aha te take e kore ai e pai te whakamahi i tētahi taupānga whakatere GPS hei utu mō tētahi pūrere motuhake?,"The correct answer is **A: Kāore e hiahiatia kia manukanuka mō tētahi hononga raraunga**.

Here's why:

* The passage states ""Ki te kore he hononga raraunga mō tō waea, kei waho rānei ia i te wāhi pā, ka whakawhāititia pea te mahi, kāore rānei i te wātea."" This directly addresses a limitation of using a smartphone GPS app: it relies on a data connection. A dedicated GPS device does not.

The other options are incorrect because they are benefits, not reasons *against* using a phone app:

* **B: Tiaki moni ana** - The passage states that phone apps ""ka penapenatia pea he pūtea.""
* **C: Kei te karo i ngā rēti** - The passage mentions avoiding rental fees.
* **D: Kāore e hiahiatia ana kia hoko mahere hōu** - The passage mentions avoiding buying new maps.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, me pēhea koe e whakaū ai e ōrite ana koe ki tētahi kaipuke tika?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **C: E tāpui ana ki tētahi māngai e tohu ana i te haerenga o Galapagos**.

Ko te whakatau tika e whai ake nei:

*   E kī ana te wāhanga me ""kia mataara ko te kaiwhakarite e whakarite ana i tō haerenga ko tētahi mātanga Galapagos me te mōhiohio pai o te whānuitanga o ngā kaipuke. Mā konā e whakarite kia tūhonotia ō aronga, ō here hoki/rānei ki te kaipuke e tino hāngai ana ki ēnā."""
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei kāore e whakamahia hei āhuatanga hai pupuri i te peti manuhiri?","The correct answer is **A: He nui tonu te mārama māori**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that casinos often avoid windows and clocks to disorient guests and keep them playing. Therefore, having a lot of natural light would be counterproductive to this strategy.
*   Options B, C, and D are all mentioned in the passage as things casinos *do* to keep guests engaged."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te tikanga kia karohia e te tūpāpaku atamai?","The correct answer is **A: He nui rawa te inu waipiro**.

The passage states: ""Heoi, ka riro te tangata i roto i tana haurangi, kei te mōhio hoki ngā kaipetipeti toa ki te hirahiratanga o te noho haurangi kore."" This translates to: ""However, a person can get lost in their intoxication, and winning gamblers know the importance of staying sober.""

Therefore, the passage suggests that a smart gambler should avoid excessive alcohol consumption.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea wāhanga o te whaikōrero e whakapūmatuatia ana i waenganui i te rerenga?","The correct answer is **B: Nouns**.

The passage clearly states that ""ko ngā kupu ingoa katoa"" (all nouns) are capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha pea ka uaua ake te pūmatuatanga o nga nouns?","The correct answer is **C: Tuhituhi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ahakoa kei te whakatāwhiwhitia te **tuhituhi** e te hiahia kia whai mōhio mēnā rānei kei te whakamahia tētahi kupu mahi, kupu whakaahua rānei ki tētahi āhua whakakupuingoa.""

This directly translates to: ""...even though **writing** is made more difficult by the need to know whether a verb or adjective is being used in a noun-like way.""

Therefore, the passage implies that the capitalization of nouns can make **writing** more difficult.
"
"""I ngā wāhi tawhiti o Mareia, ko tēhea tohu ā-ringa ko te tikanga """"kua mutu""""?""","Ko te whakautu tika ko **A: Kei te tārewa i te matimati taupū**.

Ko te take: E ai ki te kōrero i runga ake nei, ko te piko o te kōroa ki te tinana i roto i ngā wāhi taiwhenua o Marēhia, ko te tikanga ""haere mai"". He rite tēnei ki te tuone e whakamahia ana ki ētahi whenua ā-Uru, ā, me whakamahi anake mō taua take.  Ko te ""tārewa i te matimati taupū"" (curled finger) e hāngai ana ki te kōrero.
"
"""E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te tohu e tohu ana i te """"hoki mai""""?""","Based on the passage, the correct answer is:

**A: E anga ana ki te kapu e anga whakaroto ana** (The palm facing inwards)

The passage states: ""ka pōhēhē pea te tangata hāereere nō Peretānia ki Pāniora ko te ringaringa hei poroporoaki ko te kapu e aro ana ki te tangata ringaringa (kaua ki te tangata e ringaringahia ana) hei tuone mō te hoki mai."" This means a British tourist in Spain might misunderstand a wave meant as ""goodbye"" as ""come here"" if the palm is facing them.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te take o te tahu?","The correct answer is **D: Ngā paraka loose (Loose blocks)**

Here's why:

* The passage describes how large sections at the end of the glacier can break off and fall ( ""I te pito o te kōpaka tio he wāhanga nui ka pakaru mai, taka ki raro...""). This directly implies *loose blocks* are the cause of a potential hazard. The question asks about the cause of ""tahu"", and the passage describes ""wāhanga nui ka pakaru mai"", which translates to ""large sections that break off"".

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Ngā arawhata huka (Ice bridges):** While ice bridges are mentioned as potentially hiding crevasses, the passage doesn't state that they are the main source of danger.
*   **B: Ngā pūhihi tē taea te whakawātea (Non-clearable passages):** This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Ngā ana hukapapa mahi (Active ice caves):** The passage mentions that ice caves can have walls and roofs collapse, but it focuses more on the large blocks breaking off at the end of the glacier as the main danger.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the given text is **D: Ngā paraka loose**."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e taea te huna e nga arawhata hukarere?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā ana Ice**

The passage states: ""Mā konā he āpiti, he pokorua, **ka hunaia pea e ngā piriti ā-hukapapa**."" This translates to ""Because of this there are gaps, and crevasses, **which may be hidden by ice bridges**.""

The passage then continues: ""Ka turaki pea ngā pakitara me ngā tuanui o ngā **ana tio**, ā, ka kapi pea ngā tawhā."" This translates to ""The walls and roofs of **ice caves** may collapse, and crevasses may be covered.""

Therefore, ice bridges (piriti ā-hukapapa) hide crevasses and gaps, and while the passage mentions the collapse of ice cave walls and roofs, it doesn't explicitly state that ice bridges hide those. So, ice caves is the closest and most accurate answer from the provided text.
"
"I runga anō i te haerenga, me whiwhi whakatūpato tāpiri ngā haere i mua i te toro atu ki tēhea tauwāhi?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā wāhi e karapoti ana i Goma** (The areas surrounding Goma).

The text states that while Goma itself is relatively safe, *exploring areas outside of Goma requires research* to understand the ongoing conflict in North Kivu.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e kore e pai ki te tūruhi i Goma?,"The correct answer is **A: He whakangahau ngā whawhai i Kivu ki te Raki** (The fighting in North Kivu is entertaining).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that although Goma is relatively safe, you should research trips outside Goma because of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu. This implies that the fighting is a safety concern, not a source of entertainment.

The other options are directly supported by the passage:

*   B: He wāhi pai mō te whai i te Gorilla Mountain i te utu tika (A good place to see Mountain Gorillas at the right price) - ""kei reira hoki ētahi o ngā whaiwhai maunga korira iti te utu o Āwherika"" (there are also some of Africa's cheaper mountain gorilla treks).
*   C: He huarahi pai ngā tāke motopaika ki te haere (Motorbike taxis are a good way to get around) - ""Ka taea e koe te eke i ngā boda-boda (tākihi motopāika) hei huri rāuna i a Goma"" (You can ride boda-bodas (motorbike taxis) to get around Goma).
*   D: Kei te taone te turanga o te puia o Nyiragongo (The city is the base of the Nyiragongo volcano) - ""Ko te tāone te pūtake hoki hei piki i te rangitoto, i a Nyiragongo"" (The city is also the base for climbing the lava rock, Nyiragongo)."
Ahea ka wātea ai tētahi whakaaetanga mō tētahi rā tīmata i te marama o Akuhata?,"The correct answer is **B: 1 o Āperira**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that permits become available on the first of the month, four months prior to the starting month.
*   You want to hike in August.
*   Four months before August is April.
*   Therefore, the permit will become available on April 1st (1 o Āperira)."
He aha te kaupapahere e noho ana hei pare i te awa?,"The correct answer is **D: He iti noa iho ngā whakaaetanga**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that permits are required to hike below the rim of the Grand Canyon.
*   It also mentions that permits are limited to protect the park (""E whakawhāititia ana ngā whakaaetanga hei whakahaumaru i te āpiti"").
*   The passage also confirms that only ""pakupaku noa ngā whakaaetanga kua rāhuingia mō ngā tono hīkoi-mai"".

The other options are incorrect:

*   A: While walk-up permits exist, the passage emphasizes the permit system overall, not just first-come, first-served.
*   B: Permits are released on January 1st for May trips, but this isn't the only time they are available (walk-up permits are an option).
*   C: Permits can be obtained in advance, not *only* through walk-in applications.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e iti rawa te kitea i te momo hotera e whakaahuatia ana i te wāhanga nei?,"The answer is **D: Ngā rūma kātahi anō ka whakakāhoretia me ngā whakamohoa hōu (Rooms that have just been remodeled with new upgrades)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes hotels with ""ancient charms,"" ""lack of modern amenities,"" and a certain ""sophistication."" These hotels are historical. This directly contrasts with rooms that are newly renovated with modern upgrades.

The other options are more likely to be found in such hotels:

*   **A: He pae pokowai (A cocktail bar)**: Historic hotels often had bars that were important social gathering places.
*   **B: He wharekai gourmet onsite (An on-site gourmet restaurant)**: Fine dining was a key part of the experience for wealthy guests at these hotels.
*   **C: Hoa manuhiri e tino mōhiotia ana, e mōhiotia ana rānei (Well-known or recognizable guests)**: These hotels catered to the wealthy and sometimes even foreign dignitaries."
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i whakaaturia i roto i te whārangi, ko tehea o ngā tuku e whai ake nei ka iti rawa te tūponotanga o ngā manuhiri hotera","The passage describes hotels that are:

*   **Historic:** Dating back to the age of trains and steamships.
*   **Luxurious:** Catering to wealthy travelers.
*   **Social:** Featuring fine dining and nightlife.
*   **Exclusive:** Sometimes hosting foreign dignitaries.

Considering these characteristics, we can assess the likelihood of each option:

*   **A: Ngā whakarato ārai puta noa i te āhuatanga (Providing access ramps throughout the property):** While accessibility is important, historic luxury hotels might not have prioritized or implemented extensive accessibility features. It is unlikely these hotels would be equipped with widespread ramps.
*   **B: He wharekai whai kaihoko tino mōhiotia (A restaurant with highly discerning customers):** This aligns perfectly with the description of hotels that catered to wealthy individuals with refined tastes.
*   **C: He whakangahau pō e whakahere ana i te pō (Nightly entertainment on offer):** The passage explicitly mentions parties at night, indicating that entertainment was a common feature.
*   **D: Ngā mokatere o te rūma utu nui (Expensive room rentals):** The passage clearly indicates that the hotels catered to wealthy people, implying high room rates.

Therefore, the least likely feature to be found in these hotels is **A: Ngā whakarato ārai puta noa i te āhuatanga (Providing access ramps throughout the property)**, because accessibility wasn't prioritized during the time period these hotels were built."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, eaha te tia ia apehia e te mau ratere e mataitai ra i Greenland?","The correct answer is **D: E pā ana ki tētahi tangata whenua o Greenland hei “Eskimo”**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Ahakoa e whakaaetia ana te kupu ""Eskimo"" ki roto o Amerika, e whakapono ana ētahi manene he kupu whakaparahako kē, koia pū ki roto o Kānata...me ārai te hunga rāwaho i te whakamahi i taua kupu."" This clearly advises travelers to avoid using the term ""Eskimo"" when referring to the indigenous people of Greenland.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ko ētahi wāhi e mōhiotia ana mō ngā mokatere hara tiketike:** The passage states: ""Kāore i te tino mōhiotia te taihara me te kaikino whānui ki te hunga nō rāwaho ki Whenuakākāriki."" This means crime is not a known issue for foreigners.
*   **B: Te kawe mai i ngā kakahu taumaha, nā te mea he mahana te āhuarangi i te tau katoa:** This is incorrect because the passage advises the opposite: ""Ki te toro atu koe ki Whenua Kākāriki i ngā wā makariri...he mea waiwai te kawe mai i ngā kākahu he rawaka te mahana.""
*   **C: Te tūmanako ki te mahi i te wā e noho ana, nā te mea he pōhēhē pea te hononga ipurangi:** The passage suggests that internet connection is reliable: ""e pai ana te honohono a Whenuakākāriki arā e 93% o te taupori e whai ana i te āheinga ipurangi."""
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e tino raruraru ana mō ngā haere kāore anō kia rite ki Greenland?","The correct answer is **C: Huarere (Weather)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ko te haurere makariri pea te mōrearea tūturu anake ka arohia e te hunga kāore i te whakaritea"" which translates to ""The cold weather is perhaps the only real danger faced by those who are not prepared.""

The other options are mentioned, but not as a primary concern for unprepared travelers:

*   **A: Ngā waeroa o Nōroa (Nordic mosquitoes):** Mentioned as a nuisance, but not a major danger.
*   **B: Hara (Crime):** Stated that crime and public violence against foreigners is not widespread.
*   **D: Ngā Paetata (Taxes):** Taxes are not mentioned in the excerpt.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e whakamahia ana ināianei hei marae matua?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

The passage states that ""Ināianei ko tāna mahi ko te wāhi tūmatanui pokapū"" which translates to ""Now it functions as the main public space."" This directly indicates that Jardín de la Unión is currently used as a main square or public space.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i kitea i Jardín de la Unión?","The correct answer is **B: Te kāinga o tētahi pūrākau aroha tahito**.

Here's why:

*   The text clearly states that **Callejon del Beso (Huarahi o te Kihi)** is the home of an old love legend. The Jardín de la Unión, on the other hand, is where the gazebo and concerts are located, as well as where there are many restaurants and an old temple (whare tahito).

Therefore, the home of an old love legend is not found at the Jardín de la Unión, it is found at the Callejon del Beso."
"I runga anō i te whakawhitinga, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei mo te rā hīkoi ka whakaarotia he hē?","The correct answer is **D: Kāore te haere hikoi i te rā i te mea pai mō ngā whānau me ngā pēpi** (Day hiking is not ideal for families with babies).

The passage states: ""Me nui ake pea te whakarite a tētahi whānau mēnā he tamariki itiiti ōnā, ēngari e tāea ana tētahi haerenga ā-waho mēnā he pēpi, he kōhungahunga rānei."" This translates to ""A family may need to prepare more if they have young children, but an outdoor trip is possible even with babies or toddlers."" This contradicts option D. The passage actually suggests it *is* possible, just requiring more preparation.

The other options are all supported by the passage:

*   **A:** Is supported by the phrase ""Mō tētahi hīkoi ā-rā ki tētahi ara māmā kāore he tino whakaritenga e hiahiatia ana"" (For a day hike on an easy trail, not much preparation is needed).
*   **B:** Is supported by the phrase ""Ko te hīkoi rā ko ngā roanga iti iho i te te kotahi māero, tae atu ki ngā roanga roa ake ka taea te hīkoi i te rangi kotahi"" (Day hikes range from less than a mile to longer distances that can be hiked in a single day).
*   **C:** Is supported by the phrase ""ka taea e tētahi tangata e āhua whiti ana te manawa reka i ērā"" (someone who is reasonably fit can enjoy them)."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, āhea te hīkoi o te rā e tino hiahiatia ana he whakaritenga iti rawa?","The correct answer is **B: Ina pā ki tētahi huarahi ngāwari ake**.

The text states: ""Mō tētahi hīkoi ā-rā ki tētahi ara māmā kāore he tino whakaritenga e hiahiatia ana..."" which translates to: ""For a day hike on an easy trail, not many preparations are needed...""
"
"He aha te rerekētanga o ngā papa i Rogaland, i Agder rānei ki te toenga o Norway?","The correct answer is **D: I te nuinga o te wā e hīpokina ana rātau i roto i te hea**.

The passage states that in Rogaland and Agder, the plains are often called ""hei,"" which means barren, treeless land covered with heather. This directly supports option D. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i te āhua o Norway?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā pereti ngahere (Forest plates)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions **ngā tai matapari me ngā kōawaawa paripari (fjords)**.
*   It describes the high plains called ""vidde,"" which are described as ""**whānui, he tuwhera, whāroa mutunga kore**"", so **Whakatuwheratia ngā hua whenua** accurately depicts the open expanse of the Norwegian landscape.
*   The passage also mentions ""**whenua pakihi rākau kore e ūhia ana ki te putiputi waiporoporo, ki te heta**"" which is the definition of **Moorlands** and ""**hei**"" meaning ""uncultivated land without trees covered in heather.""

The passage does not mention anything resembling ""**Ngā pereti ngahere (Forest plates)**,"" making it the feature that is NOT described as a part of the Norwegian landscape in the text."
Āhea nga tūruhi e hiahia ana ki te haere ki nga pou maunga?,"The correct answer is **C: I te raumati o Īnia**.

The passage explicitly states that the peak tourist season for hill stations is during the Indian summer.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, āhea tonu te nuinga o nga tūruhi i nga pou maunga?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **C: I te raumati o Īnia**.

E ai ki te rerenga tuatahi o te wāhanga: ""Ko te wā tūruhi mō te teihana hiwi i te nuinga o te wā ka piki i te raumati o Inia.""
"
He aha te mea e ārai ai koe ki te tūmanako koe kia kitea he poti e rapu āwhina ana?,"The best answer is **A: E haere ana, whakararo ana i nga tauranga**.

The passage is about how to find a boat that needs help. The advice given includes going to marinas and talking to boaters. Therefore, the best way to be found is to be actively going to the marinas and talking to people, which is closest to ""E haere ana, whakararo ana i nga tauranga"" (Going around, down to the wharves).

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Ngā kāpene hoa (Friendly captains):** While friendly captains are nice to have, the passage emphasizes actively seeking out boats in need.
*   **C: Pānui ana i ō ratonga (Advertising your services):** This is mentioned in the passage, but is just part of the overall strategy, so its not the complete picture.
*   **D: E mōhio ana ki ngā hoa poti e pā ana ki te waka (Knowing boating friends who are knowledgeable about boats):** This could be helpful, but the passage prioritizes direct engagement at the marinas."
He aha tāu e mahi ai i nga marina ina rapu poti e hiahia ana ki te āwhina?,"Based on the provided text, the best answer is:

**A: Whakapā atu ki ngā hēramana** (Contact the sailors)

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly mentions contacting sailors in paragraphs
"
Ko tēhea tauwāhi e tono ana ki tētahi tūruhi e hiahia ana ki te hītori kawanatanga o te motu?,"The correct answer is **A: Te taha ki te Raki (The North Side)**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kei te kiato te nuinga o te whanaketanga ā-tāone o Hong Kong Island ki te whenua taumanu ki te taha o te tai raki. Koinei te wāhi i tangohia e te hunga koroniara nō Peretānia mō rātou anō, nō reira ki te rapu koe i te taunakitanga o te hītori koroniara o te takiwā, koinei tētahi wāhi pai hei tīmata."" (Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on the flat land along the north coast. This is the area the British colonialists took for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial history, this is a good place to start.). This directly links the north side of Hong Kong Island to the colonial history.
"
He aha te wāhi e ahuareka ai ki te tūruhi e aro nui ana ki ngā tirohanga whakamiharo?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Wikitōria Harbor**.

The passage states: ""Ki te kite i ngā tirohanga rawe rawa atu o Hong Kong, me wehe i te motu ka haere ai ki te tāhuna Kowloon kei tērā atu taha."" This implies that the best views of Hong Kong, which would appeal to a tourist interested in stunning views, are from the Kowloon waterfront *looking towards* Victoria Harbour.

While Hong Kong Island itself is a popular area, the passage specifies that the best views *of* Hong Kong are from across the harbor.
"
He aha ngā āhuatanga o ētahi tūru e āwhina ana ki te whakaiti i te mōrearea o te waewae o te kaieke kia mau ki te tūru?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Ngā pae haumaru**.

The passage states: ""E whai ake nei ko ētahi terapēke, inarā ko ngā terapēke Ingarihi, he pā marutau ōna e āhei ai te tarapu kirikau te taka i te terapēke mēnā kua tōia whakamuritia e tētahi kai eke e taka ana."" This translates to: ""Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to come off the saddle if a falling rider is dragged.""

Therefore, the ""pā marutau"" (safety bars) are the feature of the saddle that helps reduce the risk of a rider's foot getting stuck.
"
He aha te āhuatanga o te hu eke e āwhina ana ki te whakapiki ake i te haumaru o te kaieke i te wā e whakamahi ana i ngā rākau?,"The correct answer is **C: He rekereke** (A heel).

The passage states: ""Mātua, ko te nuinga o ngā kaieke ka mau pūtu tika pōtae tika me ngā mau rekereke tika, me te kuiti māeneene whāiti nei."" This translates to: ""First, most riders wear proper boots proper hats and proper heels, with a narrow smooth fit.""  The passage explicitly mentions ""rekereke tika"" (proper heels) as being important for rider safety.
"
He aha te tukunga ki ngā haere mā ngā whatunga whakawhiti manaaki?,"Based on the provided text, the answer is **A: Ngā Whakaritenga me ngā mano paetata** (Arrangements with local hosts).

The passage states that hospitality exchange networks connect tourists with locals in the cities they are visiting. This implies that the offering to travelers is the arrangement of accommodation with local hosts. The other options aren't directly supported by the text:

*   **B: rerenga māmā** (Easy flights) - The passage mentions a cheap flight in the context of the Couchsurfing origin story, but it's not the core offering of hospitality exchange networks.
*   **C: Ngā haereere i tukuna e ngā kaiārahi paetata** (Tours offered by local guides) - While locals might offer guidance, the main service is accommodation.
*   **D: Ngā hononga ki ētahi atu kaihaereere e toro ana ki te ūnga kotahi** (Connections to other travelers visiting the same destination) - The networks primary purpose is to connect travelers with *locals*, not other travelers.
"
"I runga anō i te whakawhitinga, ko tēhea o ngā tauākī e whai ake nei e pā ana ki ngā whatunga whakawhiti manaaki ehara i te tika?","The correct answer is **A: Ka whakaratohia tonu ngā kaihaerere ki ngā tohutoro mō ngā kaihautū o te rohe**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that available hosts *may* be listed along with reviews from other travelers. It does not say travelers are *always* given references for local hosts. The word ""tonu"" or ""always"" makes option A untrue.

The other options are supported by the text:

*   B: Some networks *may* require additional verification of travelers (this is supported by ""ahakoa kei te tuku, kei te hiahia rānei ētahi kōtuitui i te whakatūturutanga tāpiri"")
*   C: Available hosts are listed, (this is supported by ""Ā, ka rewa ake ngā kaihautū e wātea ana mā te tā, mā te ipurangi hoki rānei"")
*   D: Host reviews are sometimes available to travelers (this is supported by ""i ētahi wā he tuhinga arotake nā ētahi tāngata haerere kē atu"")"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea momo manuhiri e kitea ana i roto i tētahi rūma whare noho tiri?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **A: He manuhiri i roto i o rātau rua tekau mā rua**.

Ko te whakamārama:

*   E kī ana te kōrero ko te nuinga o ngā manuhiri o ngā whare rangatū he hunga rangatahi, ā, ko te nuinga o te wā, e rua tekau ō rātou tau.
*   Ahakoa ka kitea ētahi kaumātua, ā, ka whakaaetia ētahi whānau whai tamariki ki ngā rūma tūmataiti, ko te hunga rangatahi kei roto i ō rātou rua tekau mā rua te tino kitea i ngā whare rangatū."
"I runga anō i te haerenga, ko wai e tino noho ana i te whare noho?","The best answer is **B: E toru ngā taitamariki 22 tau e haere tahi ana**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states hostels primarily cater to young people, often around 20 years old. Option B aligns perfectly with this.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   A: While hostels *can* sometimes accommodate families, it's described as less common.

*   C: While older people *sometimes* stay in hostels, the passage emphasizes the focus on younger travelers.

*   D: Families with young children are the least likely guests in hostels."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e whakamārama tika ana i te maka pūkei?","The correct answer is **D: Ko ētahi o ngā pukumahi anake e āhei ana ki te hoki mai** (Only some boomerangs are able to return).

Here's why:

*   **P** states: ""Ki te hiahia koe ki te ako ki te whiu i tētahi pumarangi ka hokihoki mai ki tō ringa, whakaritea he pumarangi tāu e tika ana mō te hokihoki."" (If you want to learn to throw a boomerang that will come back to your hand, make sure you have a boomerang that is suitable for returning). This implies that only certain boomerangs are designed to return.
*   **P** states: ""Ko te nuinga o ngā pumarangi kei Ahitereiria he kore auraki mai."" (Most boomerangs in Australia are non-returning). This further reinforces that not all boomerangs return.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ka hoki mai tonu ki tō ringa mēnā ka tika te maka** (It will always come back to your hand if you throw it correctly): While technique is important, the text emphasizes the *type* of boomerang as the primary factor for returning.
*   **B: He pai ake ki waenganui i nga tūruhi i nga tūruhi** (It is more popular among tourists than tourists): This is not mentioned or implied in the passage. The passage indicates a tourist *interest* in learning to throw returning boomerangs.
*   **C: Kaore he maha o ngā pukumahi e wātea ana i Ahitereiria** (There are not many boomerangs available in Australia): The passage states that most boomerangs in Australia are non-returning, but it *doesn't* say they are not available.

Therefore, **D** is the most accurate reflection of the information presented in the passage."
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e whakamahia nuitia ana i roto i te kai o Javanese?,"The correct answer is **C: huka kōkona**.

The passage states: ""ngā hā matua he pai ki te hunga Javanese ko te pīnati, te hiri, te huka (inarā ko te huka kokonati Javanese)...""  This clearly indicates that coconut sugar (huka kokonati Javanese) is a commonly used ingredient in Javanese cuisine.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he pēhea te horahanga o te mate ārai?","The correct answer is **B: Pathogens**.

Here's why:

*   The passage defines an infectious disease as one caused by a pathogen (""tukumate""). Pathogens include viruses, bacteria, fungi, and other parasites.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea kāore i te mōhiotia he mate urutā?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Ngā Vaccinations (Vaccinations)**

Here's why:

*   The passage defines infectious diseases as those caused by pathogens like viruses, bacteria, fungus, or parasites.
*   Vaccinations are not pathogens; they are a preventative measure against infectious diseases. Therefore, vaccinations are not defined as infectious diseases."
I roto i tehea āhuatanga ka nui ake te whiriwhiri i te proxy tukutuku i te kaiwhakarato VPN whaiaro mo te kaiwhakamahi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ko te kaiwhakamahi te arataki i te waka http**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states that VPNs route all internet traffic, not just HTTP.** Therefore, if a user only needs to route HTTP traffic, a web proxy is sufficient and may be a simpler, cheaper, or faster option.

Let's analyze why the other options are less likely:

*   **A:** VPNs are better for routing all traffic, as stated in the passage.
*   **B:** VPNs are better for avoiding blocking and spying due to their encryption and broader coverage of traffic.
*   **D:** VPNs are generally better for high bandwidth needs, as mentioned in the passage.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā tauākī e whai ake nei mō ngā VPN me ngā takawaenga tukutuku ehara i te tika?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **D: Ka taea anake e ngā VPNs te tiki anō i ngā whakawhitinga http**.

I kī te wāhanga ka whakatika ngā VPN i ngā ara mō te hohonga Ipurangi *kaua ko te http anake*.  Ko tēnei te tikanga ka taea e rātou te whakahaere i ngā momo waka tukutuku katoa, ehara i te http anake. Ko te kōwhiringa D e kī ana i te ritenga atu.  Ko ngā kōwhiringa A, B, me C e whakaata tika ana i ngā mōhiohio kei te wāhanga.
"
He aha ka taea e tētahi te whakamahi i tētahi kamupene waea i waho o tō rātou rohe ināianei tonu?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā waea ararere Ipurangi**.

The passage states that because phone calls can be made via the internet, you no longer need a company phone where you are located. ""Ngā waea ararere Ipurangi"" translates to ""Internet protocol telephony"" or VoIP, which directly addresses how calls can be made without relying on location-specific phone companies.
"
"E ai ki te whakawhitinga, he aha pea me mahi kia whiwhi ai i ētahi waea?","The passage states: ""He nui ngā wā, me hoko anō koe i tētahi tau ā-ao e whakaae ana kia waea atu ngā waea PSTN ki a koe.""

This directly translates to ""Often, you must also purchase an international number that allows PSTN calls to call you.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Hokona he waea PSTN (Buy a PSTN phone)**. While it's technically buying a number that *allows* PSTN calls, the phrasing is the closest and most logical interpretation of the passage. The other options are incorrect based on the information provided.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kupu e kore e tika te whakahua i ngā kupu o Ingarangi?,"The correct answer is **D: He rerekē te whakahua o te nuinga o ngā kupu i runga anō i te rerenga reo e whai ake nei**

Here's why:

*   **P states:** Italian pronunciation is generally straightforward because most words are pronounced as they are written.
*   Options A, B, and C are all stated in P
*   Option D is an inaccurate statement about Italian, as it says that most words are pronounced differently based on the following context, however P states that **most** words are pronounced as they are written."
Ko tēhea o ngā āhuatanga e whai ake nei o Izmir i puta i mua i te rā hou?,"E ai ki te kōrero, ko te mākete nō te rautau 18, ngā mosque me ngā whare karakia tawhito ka noho i mua i te rā hou. Ko ngā tuanui papauku-whero ka noho i mua atu i nga hanganga hou pera i ngā boulevards whānui, ngā whare karaehe, me ngā pokapū hokohoko. Nō reira, ko te whakautu tika ko **D: Ngā tuanui kua oti te whero**.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei ehara i te āhuatanga tika o Izmir?,"The correct answer is **B: Ko te hau e whakaatu ana i nga tikanga o Turkey (The atmosphere reflects Turkish culture)**.

The passage states that Izmir's atmosphere feels more Mediterranean European than traditionally Turkish. The other options are all directly supported by the text:

*   **A: E karapoti ana te taone i te whanga nui (The city is surrounded by a large bay):** The passage mentions that the city is located on a large gulf.
*   **C: Ka kitea e koe ngā pokapū hokohoko hou me ngā hahi tawhito (You can find new shopping centers and old churches):** The passage describes modern shopping centers alongside old mosques and churches.
*   **D: Kei a ia te tauranga tuarua nui rawa atu i Turkey (It has the second largest port in Turkey):** The passage describes it as ""the second largest port""."
Ko te kupu hanami e pā ana ki te tirohanga o te aha?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **A: ngā puawai here**.

E kī ana te rerenga kōrero P, ""Ko te hanami he tirotiro ki ngā pūāwai tiere..."" (Hanami is the viewing of cherry blossoms...)
"
Na wai i taurima nga rōpū tuatahi i whakatapua ki te tirotiro i nga puawai cherry?,"The correct answer is **C: emepara o Tiapanī**

The passage states that ""ko te pua puaina tuatahi nā te emepara i whakatū mōna anake, me ōna apataki o te kāhui ariki me te kōti teitei."" This translates to ""the first cherry blossom viewing was established by the emperor for himself alone, with his royal attendants and high court.""
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā aronga e whai ake nei o Jerusalem te iti rawa o te kawe tāpoi?","E ai ki te wāhanga, he tapu a Hiruharama ki ngā hāhei kotahi-atua e toru, kei te noho hei pokapū ā-wairua, ā-hāhi, ā-ahurea, ā, he wāhi tūruhi matua ki Iharaira. E kī ana anō hoki, he tini ngā wāhi hītori, ngā wāhi ahurea, me ngā wāhi mātai whai toenga whare tangata. Kātahi ka whakahuatia ngā pokapū hokohoko muramura, ngā whare kawhe, me ngā whare kai.

Kāore te wāhanga e kī mēnā e āta whakaaetia ana a Hiruhārama hei tāone matua e te ao, ka kawea mai e te tūranga nei ētahi tūruhi. Nō reira, ko te whakautu pai rawa atu ko:

**B: Ko tōna tūnga hei taone matua o Iharaira**
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e kore e whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga nei hei mea e mōhiotia ana a Jerusalem?,"The correct answer is **A: Hītori e whakahē ana**.

The passage mentions Jerusalem's rich history, its political status as Israel's capital (despite international non-recognition), its religious significance to three major religions, and its cultural attractions. It does **not** mention a ""contradictory history,"" and in fact emphasizes the ancient and significant nature of its history.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea momo haere e kore e whai hua mai i te hoko Kāri Moho?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **B: He tangata haere e toro ana ki Kruger National Park anake**.

**He whakamārama:**

*   E ai ki te kōrero, he whaihua te Wild Card mēnā ka toro atu koe ki ētahi kōwhiringa pāka, ki te katoa rānei o ngā South African National Parks.
*   Mēnā kei te toro atu koe ki te Kruger National Park anake, kāore he take o te hoko i te Wild Card."
Ko tēhea kōrero e kore e tino whakaahua i te Kruger National Park?,"The correct answer is **C: Ko te iti rawa o ngā Pāka ā-Motu o Awherika ki te Tonga (It is the smallest of the South African National Parks)**.

The passage states that the Kruger National Park is a major attraction and considered a flagship park. It also mentions the diversity of its ecosystems. The option about purchasing a Wild Card is also directly supported by the text. The text does not mention whether it is the smallest or not; therefore, the answer is C.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e tino mōrearea ana mō ngā kaieke i ngā wāhanga pakari o te maunga?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā here mākū (Wet steps)**

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states ""ka matāra hoki i ngā wāhi hōhonu, inā koa ka mākū ana, ka tere taka ai koe ki te raruraru."" This clearly indicates that wet conditions are a significant hazard, making the stone steps slippery and increasing the risk of falls.
*   The passage states that the small caves can be narrow and cramped.

The other options are less dangerous:

*   **B: Ngā hipanga pōhatu (Stone steps):** The stone steps are helpful, but become slippery when wet.
*   **D: Ngā taura Tīra (Tirā ropes):** The passage mentions them as helpful for holding on in the steep areas.
*   **C: Ngā ana iti (Small caves):** It only states that the caves are small and can be cramped, not that they are dangerous.

"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e kore e tino whakaatu i te piki o te maunga o Machu Picchu e whakaahuatia ana i te wāhanga nei?,"The correct answer is **B: Kaore he tuhi ā ringa puta noa i nga wāhanga poupou ake** (There are no handrails throughout the steeper sections).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""...ki ngā wāhi paripari ake he taura tīra hei puringa ā-ringa tautoko"" (...in the steeper sections, there are ropes to hold onto for support). This directly contradicts option B, which states there are *no* handrails (ropes) in the steep sections.
The passage clearly indicates that option B is not true.

The other options are true according to the passage:

*   **A: Ahakoa ko nga kaipiki e tika ana, tērā pea ka puta i te manawa** (Even suitable climbers may get out of breath). The passage says it's a steep and difficult climb, implying that people will get out of breath.
*   **C: Me puta koe i te ana i runga** (You must pass through a cave on the way). The passage says ""...He ana paku rawa tata ki te tihi me puta..."" (...very small caves near the top to go through...)
*   **D: Ka mōrearea nga wāhanga poupou ake ina mākū** (The steeper sections can be dangerous when wet). The passage says ""...me matāra hoki i ngā wāhi hōhonu, inā koa ka mākū ana, ka tere taka ai koe ki te raruraru."" (...be careful of the deep sections, especially when wet, as you can quickly get into trouble.)"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ehara ēnei i te tēpara matua o te kai a Majorcan?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **C: Pata**.

I roto i te kōrero, ko te pata kaore i whakahuahia hei tēpara matua o te kai a Majorcan. Ko te parāoa, te huawhenua, me te mīti (poaka) ka whakahuahia.
"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i roto i te wāhanga nei, ko tehea kōrero e pā ana ki ngā kai Hangi ehara i te mea pono?","The correct answer is **C: I te nuinga o te wā e tunua ana ngā hapa tīpokapoka mā te whakamahi i te tautau**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that hāngī is used to cook a ""kai tunu tūturu,"" which translates to a ""traditional cooked meal."" It doesn't specifically mention shortcrust pastry.

The other options are true based on the provided text:

*   **A:** ""Ka whakamahanatia te rua ki ngā kōhatu wera mai i tētahi ahi..."" (The hole is heated with hot stones from a fire...). This supports option A.
*   **B:** ""...ka taea ētahi atu hāngī te kai...ki Pōneke..."" (...some hāngī are available...in Wellington...). This supports option B.
*   **D:** ""Kei ētahi wāhi ki Rotorua he hāngī ngāwhā..."" (In some places in Rotorua there are geothermal hāngī...). This supports option D."
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i whakahuatia hei huarahi noa hei whakawera i te poka Hangi?,"The correct answer is **A: korohū**.

The passage mentions:

*   **Ngā kōhatu wera** (hot stones) - ""Ka whakamahanatia te rua ki ngā kōhatu wera mai i tētahi ahi"" (The pit is heated with hot stones from a fire)
*   **wera puia** (volcanic heat) - ""ētahi wāhi ka wera noa mai ngā wāhi o te whenua i te mahana ngāwhā"" (some places where the earth is naturally heated by geothermal heat)

The passage doesn't mention korohū (steam) as a direct method of heating the hāngī pit.

Therefore, the answer is A.
"
"He aha pea te hua o te āhukahuka motuhake mai i te monk, i te nunui rānei?","The correct answer is **A: E mau ana i tētahi tākai hipa kanapa** (Wearing a brightly coloured scarf).

Here's why:

The passage states ""...ki te kawe atu koe i tō ake takai, inarā ko tētahi he kitakita ngā tae ka menemene mai te manake, te none rānei ki te tomokanga."" This means if you bring your own scarf and it has bright colours, the monk or nun will smile upon you at the entrance.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Kei te taupoki i ō pakihiwi** (Covering your shoulders) is a general requirement, not something that elicits special attention.
*   **C: E mau ana i tētahi takai mai i te ariki** (Wearing a scarf from the Lord) is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: E mau ana i te panekoti e tapahia ana i runga ake i te turi** (Wearing a skirt that is cut above the knee) would be against the rules and would be frowned upon, not smiled upon."
Ko tehea o ngā kakahu e whai ake nei e kore e taea te tono i te whare karakia? ,"The correct answer is **B: Poto (Shorts)**.

Here's why:

*   **Poto (Shorts):** The passage states that men need to wear pants that cover their knees and that shorts might be available at the entrance.

The other options can be clarified as such:

*   **Ngā Skirts:** The passage states that women need to wear skirts covering their knees.
*   **Tarautete:** The passage states that men need to wear pants.
*   **Ngā Tākai:** The passage states that many churches offer sarongs for women."
I te wā e whai wāhitanga ai tētahi manuhiri ki te mātakitaki whetū i a ia e haere ana ki ngā wāhi Antarctic?,"The passage states that the polar night (when the sun doesn't rise above the horizon) is a good opportunity to see the stars, and that this happens during the winter months. The passage also mentions that there is less light pollution due to the low population, which will also make the stars easier to see. Thus, option C and D are true, but only one answer can be correct. Given that the question is about *when* a visitor can see the stars, rather than *what conditions* are required, the best answer is:

**C: I roto i ngā marama hōtoke** (In the winter months)

While D is also a factor, the question asks *when* one has the *opportunity* to see the stars. The winter months provide that opportunity.

I te wā i kore ai te waea amiorangi e taea te whakakapi i te waea pūkoro?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **A: Mēnā ka whakararurarutia pea te raina tirohanga ki te aorangi**.

E ai ki te kōrero i roto i te P, ""ehara te waea āmiorangi i te tino whakakapinga mō tētahi waea pūkoro, nā te mea me noho ki waho i te whare me te tirohanga wātea atu ki te āmiorangi kia pato i tētahi waeatanga atu.""  Ko te tikanga, ki te kore e kitea te āmiorangi (whakararuraru te raina tirohanga), ka kore e mahi te waea āmiorangi.
"
Āhea ka pai ake ai tētahi waea tawhiorangi ki tētahi waea pūtau?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **B: I te wā o te haerenga poti**.

E ai ki te kōrero, kei te whakamahia auautia te ratonga waea āmiorangi e te kaipuke, tae atu hoki ki ngā waka rēhia. Ko te haerenga poti he momo waka rēhia, nā reira koinei te wā pai ake ai te waea āmiorangi i te waea pūkoro.

Ko ētahi atu kōwhiringa kāore e tika ana i te mea e kīia ana i roto i te kōrero me noho koe ki waho i te whare, ā, ehara i te mea mēnā kei te hararei koe i te taone.
"
Na te papā o ēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei i ahu mai ki te hanganga o te Whenua o Transnistria?,"The correct answer is **B: Ethnicity**.

The passage states: ""Ko Moldova tētahi whenua tini mātāwaka kua pāngia e te raru mātāwaka. I te tau 1994, i ara ake tēnei pakanga ki te hanganga o te Transnistria Republic..."" which translates to ""Moldova is a multi-ethnic country that has been affected by ethnic issues. In 1994, this conflict arose with the formation of the Transnistria Republic..."" This clearly links the formation of Transnistria to ethnic issues.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ana i te Republic of Transnistria e rerekē ana i te toenga o Moldova?  ,"The correct answer is **D: Moni** (Money).

The passage states: ""kei a rātou tō rātou ake kāwanatanga, pūnaha moni anō hoki, engari kāore i te whakamanatia e tētahi atu whenua he mema nō te Kotahitanga o Ngā Iwi o te Ao"" which translates to ""they have their own government, monetary system as well, but not recognized by any country as a member of the United Nations""

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **A: Reo (Language):** The passage says that the Romanian language is the main language of Moldova, but Russian is also widely spoken. It does not suggest that the language spoken in Transnistria is different from the rest of Moldova.
*   **B: Whakapono (Religion):** The passage states that the main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christian, and it doesn't say the religion in Transnistria is different.
*   **C: Āhukahuka UN (UN Recognition):** While the passage mentions that Transnistria is not recognized by the UN, it's not something they *follow* differently. It's a status imposed on them.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, āhea haere ai ki Montevideo mehemea e tūmanako ana rātau ki te karo i nga āhuatanga hau?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **C: I roto i ngā marama raumati o Hemisphere ki te Raki**.

Anei te whakamārama:

*   E ai ki te wāhanga, i te wā e raumati ana ki te tonga (Montevideo), e takurua ana ki te raki. Nō reira, mēnā e hiahia ana koe ki te karo i ngā āhuatanga hau (pērā i te makariri o te hōtoke), me haere koe ki Montevideo i te wā o ngā marama raumati o te raki, kia pērā ai te raumati ki Montevideo.

Ko ētahi atu kōwhiringa kāore i te tika, nā te mea e whakaatu ana i te hōtoke ki Montevideo.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, āhea te haere ki Montevideo mehemea he wāhi rātau ki tētahi āhuarangi mātao ake?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **B: Ina raumati i te Hemisphere ki te Raki**.

**Whakamārama:**

* **Te Take:** E kī ana te kōrero he raumati ki Montevideo i te wā e takurua ana ki te Raki, ā, he pārū tōna āhuarangi. Mēnā e rapu ana te tangata i tētahi āhuarangi mātao ake, me haere rātau i te wā e takurua ana ki Montevideo.
* **Te Hononga:** I te mea e takurua ana ki Montevideo i te wā e raumati ana ki te Raki, ko te wā pai mō te haere ko te **raumati i te Hemisphere ki te Raki**.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tēhea o ēnei e pā ana ki tētahi kaitoi whakairo kua whakatūria, i te mea he mahi whakangaro?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā takahanga Graffiti**.

Here's why:

* **The passage contrasts old graffiti with modern, ""legitimate"" mural art.** Old graffiti is described as vandalism (""he āhuatanga kikino, he tūkino i ngā taputapu mā te peita rehurehu"").
* **The question asks which option describes something *destructive* done by an *established* graffiti artist.** The point is that when they create graffiti that is considered vandalism, it is destructive. Graffiti is referred to by the term ""Ngā takahanga Graffiti""
* **Options B, C, and D** are just descriptions of graffiti in general, they don't specifically imply destructive actions, nor are they the correct term for graffiti in this context.
"
He aha te āhua o nga hākari pūoro e whakaaro ana ētahi kaiāwhina he wāhi tino nui o te wheako?,"The correct answer is **B: Kei te puni i runga i te pae**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states ""ko te nuinga o ngā kaitautoko o ngā huihuinga waiata nei ka hiahia ki te whakapuni ki rō papa, ā, ko te nuinga o ngā kaitautoko ka whakatau koinaka tētahi o ngā tīno wāhanga o te wheakoranga."" This translates to ""most attendees of these music festivals like to camp on site, and most attendees consider this a key part of the experience.""
*   The other options are mentioned in the passage but are not identified as a *key* part of the experience:

    *   A (Te kawe tamariki nohinohi): Refers to some festivals having special tent areas for families with young children, not a defining aspect of the experience.
    *   C (Pūoro e purei tōmuri ana ki te pō): Refers to music playing late, not a defining aspect of the experience.
    *   D (Kei te moata): Refers to the suggestion to arrive early.

Therefore, **B** is the answer most directly supported by the text."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te tikanga kia manakē te kaiāwhina hākari mehemea e hiahia ana rātau ki te hopuni e tata ana ki te pūoro?","The correct answer is **D: Kei te moata** (Arriving early).

The passage states: ""Me kei te hiahia koe kia tata atu ki ngā mahi, me tae wawe atu koe kia whai wāhi atu ki tētahi puni tata ki ngā waiata."" This translates to: ""If you want to be close to the action, you need to arrive early to get a camping spot close to the music.""
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Me karo ngā manuhiri ina rapu i te oranga pō i te raki o New Mexico?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā pae taone iti** (Small town bars).

The passage specifically warns that small town bars might not be safe for visitors and highlights the issue of drunk driving being prevalent around them.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, kei hea te wāhi e kitea ai e te manuhiri ngā whakangahau rongonui i te raki o New Mexico?","The correct answer is **C: I tētahi kaihoko e tata ana ki Sante Fe**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Tata ki te katoa o ngā whare petipeti kua rārangihia ki runga ake e whakarato ana i ngā inu, ā, kei te tō mai ētahi o rātou i te whakangahau ingoa-parani (inarā ko ngā mea rahi e tino tata ana ki Albuquerque me Santa Fe)."" This means that brand-name entertainment is more likely to be found at casinos near Albuquerque and Santa Fe."
Tērā pea e hiahia ana ngā kaimahi mōhio pūtea ki te karo ko tēhea momo inu?,"The correct answer is **D: Wai Fruit (Fruit Juice)**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He nui te utu mō ngā inu huarākau ēngari he tīno reka."" (Fruit drinks are expensive but very delicious).

Given this information, financially conscious people would probably avoid buying expensive fruit drinks. The other options are not as directly tied to a cost-related factor in the given text.
"
"I runga anō i te wāhi i whakaahuatia i roto i te wāhanga, ko tehea o ngā tono inu e whai ake nei ka raruraru pea e te kaiwhakarato?","The correct answer is **D: He mā papatahi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mo ngā Ahitereiria, ko te ariā mō te kawhe """"papatahi mā' he manene."" This means the concept of a ""flat white"" is foreign or unfamiliar to them. Therefore, a customer ordering a flat white would likely cause confusion or be difficult to fulfill for the supplier.

The other options are likely available:
*   **A: He pango poto (short black)**: The passage mentions that a short black is referred to as an ""espresso"".
*   **B: He tau Kotahi (Number One)**: The passage states that ""Number One"" is a local beer.
*   **C: He Sauvignon Blanc mai i New Zealand**: The passage mentions that Australian and New Zealand wines are becoming more widely available."
E toru rau tau te roa o te wā o te whakawātea e te rōpū nei?,"The correct answer is **D: Nga Paniora (The Spanish)**.

The passage states: ""I tīmata te iwi Pāniora ki ngā mahi raupatu, toru rautau te roa."" (The Spanish people began the conquest, which lasted three centuries.)
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te huarahi pai rawa atu ki te tiki i tētahi Parihi kia mahana ki a koe?","The best answer based on the passage is **C: Kia whai whakaaro (Be considerate)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes behaving ""bien eleve"" (well-mannered).** Being ""bien eleve"" implies being considerate, polite, and respectful.
* **It says the aloofness of Parisians disappears when you show simple kindness.** This directly supports the idea that considerate behavior is effective.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Attempt ki te hōrite i te āhua o te Parihi** - This means attempting to mimic the Parisian demeanor. The text never specified trying to mimic, rather show good character.
*   **B: Kia nui ake te maia** - This means to be more confident. Confidence is nice, but good character is key.
*   **D: Whakaatu whanonga kōaro** - This means to show weird or strange behavior, which goes against what the passage specifies."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i te whakaarotia he kounga tīwharawhara o nga Parisian?","The correct answer is **D: ohorere**.

The passage states that Parisians are known for being proud (whakahīhī), ignorant (kuare), and snooty (whakamenemene). It doesn't mention anything about being easily surprised (ohorere). ""ahuaatua"" is not an accurate translation of ""kuare"" or ""whakamenemene"". Therefore, surprise is the quality that isn't considered a negative stereotype of Parisians in this passage.
"
He aha te painga o te Tauaha Tuatahi i runga i te MetroRail o Cape Town?,"The correct answer is **B: Ehara i te tokomaha o ngā tāngata** (Not as many people).

The passage states that MetroPlus (First Class) is ""hāneanea, ā, kāore hoki e tino nui te tāngata ki MetroPlus"" which translates to ""comfortable, and not very crowded.""
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha ia tereina haere i Cape Town?","The correct answer is **D: Ngā kaiako tauaha Tuatahi, Tuatoru hoki** (First and Third Class carriages).

The passage explicitly states:

*   ""Kei Kei MetroRail ngā taumata e rua...ko MetroPlus (ka kīia hoki ko Taumata Tuatahi), me Metro (e kīia ana ko Taumata Tuatoru)."" This translates to: ""Cape Town MetroRail has two levels...MetroPlus (also called First Class), and Metro (referred to as Third Class).""

Therefore, the trains have First and Third Class carriages.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he tūkino kararehe e kore pea e mahi?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **A: Taketia he rua**.

Ko te taketake i te rua ehara i te mea e pa ana ki ngā riha kararehe e pā ana ki te haere, ā, kāore hoki i te kīia he tūkino kararehe. Ko ngā kōwhiringa e toe ana (whakapouri i ngā mate, horahia he mate, me te mate tōpana) he pānga katoa ki ngā riha kararehe me ngā tūkino ka puta mai i a rātou.
"
Ki hea hokona ai ngā kāri waea utu-tōmua?,"The correct answer is **C: I ngā toa kokonga**

The passage states: ""Kua whakakīia ia toa-koki ki te huhua o kāri wāea hoko kua utua kētia..."" which translates to ""Every corner store is filled with a multitude of prepaid calling cards...""
"
He pēhea te āheitanga o ngā mokatere waea pai ake i tukuna e ētahi kāri?,"The correct answer is **B: Mā ngā tau wātea-utu**

The passage states: ""Ko te urunga ki ēnei ratonga, i te nuinga o te wā, kei roto i te nama waea kore-utu ka taea te waea atu i tētahi waea kore-utu."" This translates to: ""Access to these services, is usually through a toll-free number that can be called from a toll-free phone."" Therefore, the better rates are accessed *through toll-free numbers*.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā rākau e whai ake nei he iti iho te pūnoa i roto i te pāka ā iwi o Plitvice Lakes?","The passage states that the Plitvice Lakes National Park has ""beech, spruce, and fir"" trees. It does *not* mention oak trees. Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Oki** (Oak).
"
Ko tēhea o ngā ao kararehe āhua kore e whai ake nei e kitea ana i roto i te pāka ā iwi o Plitvice Lakes?,"The correct answer is **D: Capercaillie**.

The passage explicitly mentions that the Capercaillie can be found in Plitvice Lakes National Park. The other options are not mentioned.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha tonu ngā waehere rohe e āwhina ana?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **B: Mana mākete**.

Kei te kōrero te whakatau ki te hiahia o ngā kamupene pāpaho ki te whakahaere i ā rātou mākete, ā, e kī ana ko te ""aukati tārua koremana"" he whakapae noa iho. Ko te tino take ko te whai mana whakahaere nui ake, me te hanga pūtea.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he teka mō ngā waehere rohe e mau tonu ana e ngā kamupene pāpāho?","The passage states that media companies *claim* the purpose of region coding is to prevent unauthorized copying, but the passage argues that this is a lie. The passage also states the *real* reason is to gain more market control and make money. Therefore, the false claim is that region codes help to prevent unauthorized copying.

So the answer is:

B: Ka āwhina rātau ki te karo i te tāruatanga ture kore mana (They help to prevent unauthorized copying).
"
"Ina tae ki tō kāinga tupu, ko tēhea tukanga he ōpaki noa iho?","The correct answer is **D: Mana ritenga** (Customs).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on:**
    * Difficulties sometimes encountered with customs processes.
    * Knowing what items are allowed and disallowed.
    * Declaring items exceeding legal limits.

* **The question asks about the process when arriving in your home country:** Customs is the process that specifically deals with inspecting goods, ensuring they comply with regulations, and collecting duties/taxes.

Let's eliminate the other options:

* **A: Ngā taki manene (Immigration checks):**  While immigration is also a process upon arrival, the passage is more specifically about goods and declarations.
* **B: Kei te kōrero i ngā tūemi (Declaring items):** This is *part* of the customs process, but not the overall process itself.
* **C: Ngā tepe ture o ngā tūemi (Legal limits of items):** This is a *factor* you need to be aware of for customs, but not the process itself.

Therefore, **Mana ritenga (Customs)** is the most comprehensive answer that aligns with the passage's main points.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei me mōhio koe i mua i to taenga atu ki tō kāinga tupu?,"The best answer is **D: Mēnā kāore e whakaaetia ngā tūemi e kawea mai ana e koe** (If the items you are bringing are not allowed).

Here's why:

*   **The prompt emphasizes knowing what is allowed or not allowed.** The main point is to understand the regulations regarding what you can bring into the country.

*   **Option D directly addresses this.** Knowing if your items are prohibited is crucial for avoiding issues with customs.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Mēnā he wāhitaki nekeneke (If there is a mobile location)**: While knowing about mobile customs locations might be helpful, it's not the primary concern raised in the prompt.

*   **B: Mēnā e hiahia ana koe ki te whakapuaki tūemi i runga i ngā tepe ā-ture (If you need to declare items above legal limits)**: This is important, but it's secondary to knowing what's outright prohibited.

*   **C: Mēnā he Mana Ritenga (If there is a Customs Authority)**: This is a general fact; every country has a Customs Authority. The important thing is to be aware of the rules set by this authority.

Therefore, option D is the most relevant and important piece of information to know before arriving in your home country, based on the information provided in the prompt."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he nui tonu ngā mea e āhei ai ngā kaipiki ki te kite i ngā ararere hōu i roto i te Awaawa o Cochamó?","The correct answer is **D: Ngā pātū** (The Walls).

The passage states: ""Kei te whakatūtū tonu ngā kaipiki mai i ngā tōpito katoa o te ao i ngā ara hou ki ōna pakitara mutunga kore."" This translates to: ""Climbers from all over the world are still establishing new routes on its endless walls."" Therefore, the endless walls allow climbers to discover new routes in the Cochamó Valley.
"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i homai i roto i te wāhanga, ko wai e hipoki ana i te nuinga o ngā whakawhiti i te Hau-ā-uru?","Based on the information provided, the correct answer is **D: LATAM Oneworld**.

The passage states: ""Heoi anō, ka ūhia e Star Alliance te katoa atu i te taha Rāwhiti o te Tonga o te Moana a Kiwa mai i Santiago de Chile ki Tahiti, te rerenga LATAM Oneworld. Ehara tēnei rerenga i te kōwhiringa kotahi ki te hiahia koe ki te hiki i te Tonga o te Moana nui a Kiwa me te tai uru o Amerika ki te Tonga.""

This tells us that LATAM Oneworld covers at least part of the Western South Pacific. The other options are explicitly ruled out or are too general.
"
Ko tēhea hononga rererangi e whakaiti ana i te iti rawa o ngā whakawhiti moana i te hauwhā ki te Tonga?,"The correct answer is **A: Star Alliance**.

The passage states that Star Alliance covers the eastern South Pacific crossing from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, while no single airline alliance covers all three South Hemisphere ocean crossings. This implies that Star Alliance covers at least one, making it the best option to minimize ocean crossings compared to the other alliances listed which are specifically mentioned as not covering certain crossings.
"
Ko tēhea whakahaere haereere i tutuki ai ngā Haerenga Whakahaere Huri noa?,"Based on the text provided, here's the breakdown and the correct answer:

*   **P:** States that The Global Running Tours is growing and explores the experiences of runners in four major countries. It mentions examples of local running tours in Barcelona, Copenhagen, and Prague.

*   **Q:** Asks which tour organization the Global Running Tours company achieved.

Given the information, the most accurate answer is:

**D: Whakahaere ana i ngā Haereere Barcelona**

**Reason:**

The passage explicitly states ""E tangata whenua ana ki roto o te omanga a Barcelona, a Running Tours Barcelona..."" This means the Global Running Tours company is within the Running Tours Barcelona organisation.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   A: Whakahaere ana i Koupākihi - This is too general
*   B: Haere ki nga haerenga oma - This is a general description of what they do, not a specific organization.
*   C: Whakahaere ana i ngā Haerenga Prague - While Prague is mentioned, Barcelona is the first and more directly linked example of a local running tour within the Global Running Tours network."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ka awhina a Go Running Tours ki te hono atu e hia nga momo whakahaere tirotiro?","The correct answer is **A: Whā**.

The passage explicitly mentions that The Global Running Tours explores the ""huhua o ngā kaiomaoma i ngā whenua rahi e whā"" (the multitude of runners in four large countries). It then lists specific running tours in Barcelona, Copenhagen, and Prague, implying these are examples within those four countries.
"
He aha te mahi a te manuhiri ki te mea e tumanako ana ia kia tino kitea te cheetah?,"Based on the provided text, the best answer is **C: Whakamahia ngā karu** (Use binoculars).

Here's why:

*   The text states that lions, cheetahs, and leopards can be shy and are better seen with binoculars (""Ka whakamā i ētahi wā ngā raiona, ngā tīta, ngā rēpara hoki, ā, ka pai ake tō kite i a rātou ki ngā karu whakatata."")

Let's look at why the other options are not the *best* answer:

*   **A: Haere ki runga i te safari hiki (Go on a walking safari)** While a walking safari might offer different perspectives, the text specifically mentions that binoculars are helpful for viewing shy animals like cheetahs.
*   **B: Haere ki runga i te hīkoi ngahere (Go on a bush walk)** - This is the same as A.
*   **D: Tangohia he motokā me te whakamahi i ngā taputapu paerewa (Take a car and use standard equipment)** This might provide basic viewing, but the text suggests binoculars are needed for better viewing of shy animals."
"I runga anō i te haerenga, ko tēhea momo kararehe tērā pea ka tūtaki i te wā o te whakawhānuitanga i roto i te waka?","Based on the text, the correct answer is **B: Giraffes**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that elephants and giraffes may sometimes approach the vehicles, allowing for great viewing opportunities.
*   The passage also says that lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy and better viewed through binoculars."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te utu o te haereere?","The passage states that solo or duo travelers should try to form groups to reduce the cost per person. This implies that traveling alone or in small groups is more expensive.  Therefore, forming larger groups is better for lowering the cost per person.

Let's look at the options:

*   **A: E haere ana i a koe anō (Traveling alone)** - The passage implies this is more expensive.
*   **B: Kimi ana i tētahi rōpū e whā (Finding a group of four)** - While better than traveling alone, the passage suggests forming larger groups for even better savings.
*   **C: Haere ana me tētahi atu tangata (Traveling with one other person)** - Similar to traveling alone, this is likely more expensive.
*   **D: Kimi ana i tētahi rōpū e ono neke atu rānei (Finding a group of six or more)** - The passage implies this is the most cost-effective option.

Therefore, the best answer is **D: Kimi ana i tētahi rōpū e ono neke atu rānei**.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko wai pea ka haumaru i te mokatere whakaterenga tino pai?","The correct answer is **A: Ko nga tūruhi e hiahia ana ki te riwhi motokā** (Tourists who want to rent a car).

Here's why:

* **P states:** Smaller groups might face higher per-person costs if they travel individually or in pairs because there are fewer trips for large groups. The passage suggests there's a scheme to make people *believe* they have to pay more, when in reality, tourists are often rotated to fill cars.
* **A:** The passage doesn't guarantee someone is safer when wanting to rent a car. However, the scheme in the passage implies people have to make the decision to rent a car in the first place before they might get manipulated to pay a higher price.
* **B, C, D:** These options are all groups of people, and the passage argues smaller groups are vulnerable to the inflated prices.

"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te āwhina ki te āhukahuka puta noa i te ao o San Francisco?","The correct answer is **A: He arotahi auau i roto i ngā momo toi me te pāpāho**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ko te tōaitanga o ngā puoro, ngā kiriata, ngā tuhinga me ngā ahurea rongonui i āwhina ai i te tāone me ana wāhi papai kia hau te rongo i te ao."" This translates to ""The abundance of music, movies, writing and popular culture has helped the city and its attractions gain global fame.""  This directly supports the idea that a focus in arts and media contributed to San Francisco's worldwide recognition.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki San Francisco ehara i te tika?","The correct answer is **D: Kei te whakawhirinaki katoa te ohanga ki te tuuruhi** (The economy is entirely dependent on tourism).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that while San Francisco's economy is linked to being a world-class tourist destination, **it is diversified**. It explicitly lists other major sectors like professional services, government, finance, and trade.

The other options are all supported by the text:

*   **A: He rite tonu te whakaaturanga i roto i ngā whitiāhua me ngā pukapuka** (Is constantly featured in movies and books): The passage mentions the impact of music, movies, and popular culture on San Francisco's global recognition.
*   **B: He nui te kai Ahia** (There is a lot of Asian food): The passage says San Francisco is one of the best places in the country for various Asian cuisines.
*   **C: He maha ngā hōtēra me ngā pokapū hui** (Has many hotels and meeting centers): The passage mentions San Francisco has developed a large tourism infrastructure with hotels, restaurants, and meeting facilities."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea momo haere kāore pea e whai hua ki te whakamahi i ngā ratonga a te māngai haere?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **B: He tangata haere noa.**

He aha?

*   **He tangata haere noa:** Ko te kōrero e āta whakanui ana i te whai hua o ngā kaiwhakarite hāereere ki te whakarite i ngā wāhi noho, ki te tuku i ngā kete paheko me ētahi atu whakaritenga. Mēnā he ngawari te haerenga, ā, kaore e hiahiatia ngā āwhina motuhake, kāore pea te māngai haere e tino whai hua.

Ko ētahi atu kōwhiringa:

*   **He haere whakarihariha:** Ko te whakarite i ngā whakatikatika me ngā tono kia tukuna i te tuatahi ki te kaitiaki haereere, kaua ko te hōtēra. No reira, he haere whakarihariha e whai hua ana ki te whakamahi i ngā ratonga a te māngai haere.
*   **He tangata haere kāore anō kia whiwhi i tana visa:** E ai ki te kōrero, ka taea hoki e rātou te pupuri i te whakaritenga māu ki te hiahia wā koe hei whakaaro ki te tukunga, ki te whiwhi rānei i ētahi atu puka mō te wāhi ka torohia e koe (hei tauira, he pane uruuruwhenua).
*   **He tangata haere e pai ana ki te tono mo nga putea:** He rite tonu te tuku a ngā kaiwhakarite hāereere i ngā kete kei roto rā ko te parakuihi, ngā whakaritenga ikiiki ki/atu i te tauranga wakarererangi, ngā kete paheko i te rerenga me te hōtēra rānei.

*   **Ngā mahi hōtēra (Hotel operations):** The passage mentions that travel agents often have arrangements with hotels and can book various types of accommodation.
*   **Ngā mōkī tārewa-katoa (All-inclusive packages):** The passage mentions packages including breakfast, airport transfers, or flight and hotel combinations. This suggests all-inclusive packages.
*   **Kei te pupuri i tētahi tūtohutanga (Holding a reservation):** The passage states that agents can hold reservations for you while you consider an offer or obtain necessary documents.
*   **Ngā tuhinga haere kua manakohia (Approved travel documents):** While the passage mentions agents can assist in obtaining documents for your destination (like visas), it does not specifically mention that they ensure travel documents are approved. It is implied but not stated explicitly.

Therefore, approved travel documents are the least directly mentioned benefit of using a travel agent in the provided passage."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha ngā taupānga kaiwhakamāori kupu wā tūturu kāore e taea?","The correct answer is **D: E whakamāori ana tika 100% o te wā**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kua pai rawa ake ngā mihini whakamāori/whakapākehā, me te āheinga ki te whakamāori/whakapākehā tika nei (me te iti ake hoki o te kupu kīwaha), ēngari me āta titiro, kei hē pea hoki."" This means that while translation machines have improved, they are *not* always accurate and can make mistakes. Therefore, a real-time translation app that is 100% accurate all the time doesn't exist. The other options *are* capabilities mentioned in the passage for some apps.
"
He aha ngā whakawhitinga ka taea te mahi tuimotu?,"The correct answer is **C: Tikiake raraunga reo**.

The passage states that Google Translate allows for offline translation ""ā muri i te tikiake i te raraunga o te reo e hiahiatia ana"" (after downloading the data of the desired language).
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e kore e taea te whakaoho i avalanches?,"The correct answer is **A: Huka hāpiri**.

The passage states that avalanches can be triggered by:

*   The sun warming the snow
*   Additional snowfall
*   Other natural processes
*   People

Therefore, compacted snow (huka hāpiri) is not listed as a trigger. While it can contribute to the overall snowpack instability that *allows* an avalanche, it isn't directly listed as a triggering mechanism.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e heke iho ana hei horonga?","The correct answer is **C: He rōrahi hukarere e hiahiatia ana i runga i ngā pānaki poupou**.

Here's why:

* **P** states that avalanches happen because parapara (slopes) can only hold so much hukarere (snow/ice). So a certain volume is needed.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage states that the problem is the *stickiness* of the snow, not that it isn't triggered.
* **B:**  Trees are not mentioned.
* **D:** While humans *can* trigger avalanches, the passage states that the ice needs to be forced to come down (turupana).  Snow left behind by humans doesn't fit this description, plus it is only one potential cause and option C is far more fundamental to the creation of avalanches according to the passage."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko te kare i takea mai i ēhea mea whakarato?","The correct answer is **B: Otaota me nga mea kakara**.

The passage states: ""Ko te kai kari tētahi kai kua whakaritea ki ngā **otaota, ki ngā rau kikini**..."".  This translates to: ""Curry is a dish prepared with **herbs and spices**..."". Therefore, herbs and spices are the defining ingredients of a curry according to the text.
"
"I ētahi rohe, i ētahi wā ka whakamahia te waiu kōkō hei whakakapi i te aha o te mea i roto i te kari?","The correct answer is **C: Yogurt**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ki ngā rohe tuawhenua o Īnia ki te Raki, o Pakitāne, kei te whakamahia whānuitia te miraka tepe ki ngā kari; ki Īnia ki te Tonga...kei te whakamahia whānuitia te miraka kokonati."" This translates to: ""...in the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is widely used in curries; in South India...coconut milk is widely used.""
* **Q asks:** In some regions, coconut milk is sometimes used as a replacement for what in a curry?
* **Therefore,** coconut milk replaces yogurt in some regions."
He aha i tika ai te huri huri noa i ngā Maunga Transantarctic kia eke ai ki te papa?,"The correct answer is **C: Kaore nga tarakihana motuhake i te nimble.**

The passage states ""Kāore ēnei i te tino kakama nō reira me roa te kōtiutiu o te ara ki ngā Transantarctic Mountains kia eke ki te mānia"" which translates to ""These are not very nimble, therefore the route must wind around the Transantarctic Mountains to reach the plain."" This directly explains why the tractors need to go around the mountains – because they aren't nimble enough to go over or through them directly.
"
"I te taha o te South Pole Traverse, he aha te mea kua tohua ki nga haki?","The correct answer is **C: Kua kōpikotia ngā Crevasses ki te hukarere**.

The passage states: ""He hukapapa kīato, ā, kua whakakīia, kua tohua ki te haki ngā āpiti."" This translates to ""It is dense ice, and the crevasses have been filled and marked with flags.""
"
He aha te mea e kore e whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga hei mea e tika ana kia mōhio nga turuhi ina tūhura i te Tonga o Awherika?,"The correct answer is **C: Tata tonu ki ngā whenua katoa e noho tata ana ki Awherika ki te Tonga e mau ana**

Here's why:

*   **A: He rerekē ngā whakaritenga o nga Iwi rerekē mō ngā Visa:** The passage explicitly mentions ""Ka rerekē ngā hiahia pane uruwhenua me ngā utu mai i tētahi whenua ki tētahi atu."" (Visa requirements and costs vary from country to country)
*   **B: Ko te tirotiro i te motokā he huarahi pai ki te haere ki ngā wāhi i waho i te ara i whiua:** The passage states, ""Ko te haere ki Awherika ki te Tonga mā runga motuka e kite ai te tangata i tōna ātaahua, me te kite hoki i ētahi wāhi i tua atu i ngā ara ka whāia e te tūruhi."" (Going to South Africa by car allows you to see its beauty and also see places beyond the beaten tourist path).
*   **D: Ka taunakitia he 4x4 mēnā ka haere mā te motokā:** The passage says, ""...kei te tino tohua tētahi 4x4, ā, he maha ngā wāhi ka taea anake ki tētahi 4x4 he teitei te pūtake wīra."" (a 4x4 is highly recommended, and many places are only accessible with a 4x4 with a high wheelbase).
*   **C: Tata tonu ki ngā whenua katoa e noho tata ana ki Awherika ki te Tonga e mau ana:** The passage actually indicates the opposite: ""ahakoa he mauritau te Tonga o Awherika ehara i te mea he pēnei ngā whenua tata katoa"". This means ""although South Africa is peaceful not all the neighboring countries are.""

Therefore, the answer is **C**, because the passage states South Africa is peaceful, but not all neighboring countries are. Therefore, stating 'nearly all countries neighboring South Africa are stable' is incorrect, according to the source text."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te tohutohu kino mo nga tūruhi e kimi ana ki te hōpara i Awherika ki te Tonga ma te motokā?","The correct answer is **B: Ahakoa e tūtohutia ana he 4x4, ka taea te toro atu ki te nuinga o ngā wāhi mā te waka noa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Ka taea tēnei ki tētahi waka noa ina āta whakamaheretia engari kei te tino tohua tētahi 4x4, ā, he maha ngā wāhi ka taea anake ki tētahi 4x4 he teitei te pūtake wīra.""
    This clearly indicates that while a regular car *can* be used with careful planning, there are *many* places accessible *only* by a 4x4. The answer B makes it sound like most places are reachable by car which is incorrect.
*   A, C, and D align with information presented in the passage.

"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e kore e whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga hei mōrearea mōrearea o te waiho i ō putea e kore e tirohia?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka taea rātau te pōraru ki tētahi atu tangata**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Tērā pea ka tāhaetia rātau** - While not explicitly stated, the text implies this risk by emphasizing the need to keep your bags in sight, and unattended bags are a target.
*   **B: Ka taea e koe te mōhio hei kaikawe rongoā** - This is directly mentioned in the passage (""Ka whakamahia pea koe hei kaikawe tarukino ahakoa tō kore mōhio..."").
*   **D: Tērā pea ka tirohia rātau e ngā mana hei tuma pōma tūpono** - This is also directly mentioned (""...ka tō mai hoki pea te tirohanga o ngā mana e mataara ana ki ngā whakatuma pōmu"").
*   **C: Ka taea rātau te pōraru ki tētahi atu tangata** - This scenario of bags being confused with another person's bags is not mentioned in the passage."
He aha te mea kāore i whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga e pā ana ki te kawe tarukino?,"The correct answer is **B: Me whai whakaaro anō i te wā e haere ana ki te ao whānui.**

Here's why:

*   The paragraph focuses specifically on the dangers of unknowingly carrying drugs for others, the consequences, and related security concerns. It doesn't generally discuss the need for overall caution while traveling internationally.

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned:

*   **A: I ētahi whenua, ka taea te whakawakia ki te mate te hunga ka hara tuatahi** - The passage explicitly states that in some countries, even first-time offenders can face severe penalties including imprisonment for over 10 years or even death.
*   **C: Ka taea te whakamahi i ngā kurī rongoā me te kore pānui** - The passage directly mentions that drug-sniffing dogs can be used while waiting in line without prior warning.
*   **D: Tērā pea ka tangohia e ngā mana tō putea, ahakoa kāore koe i te mau tarukino** - It mentions that unattended bags attract attention and may also attract the attention of authorities vigilant for bomb threats."
He aha te momo inu e kore e whakahuatia hei mea hei whakamātau i te hanga i te kāinga i te wā o te hararei?,"The correct answer is **A: Te waiu** (Milk).

The passage mentions:

*   ""kawhe mōmona i te ata"" (rich coffee in the morning)
*   ""tī kamomira whakatā i te pō"" (relaxing chamomile tea in the evening)
*   ""ranunga"" that you can mix or stir to find ""inu māmā"" (an easy drink) that can be prepared for breakfast.
*   ""pāpara kāuta ki ngā pāpara rānei"" (bars or pubs)

Therefore, coffee, tea, and mixed drinks of different kinds are all alluded to. Milk is not mentioned as something you would experiment with making."
"Ko tēhea o ngā mea e whai ake nei me toro atu koe i a koe e noho hararei ana, mēnā e mōhiotia ana tō taone mō tōna ahurea inu?","The correct answer is **C: Pubs kāore koe i te auau noa iho**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically advises that if you're in a town with a drinking culture, you should explore **pubs or bars in neighborhoods that you don't normally frequent**. This aligns directly with option C.
*   The other options are not specifically mentioned or encouraged in the passage relating to a drinking culture and the act of vacationing in one's hometown.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the passage, option C is the most appropriate answer."
Kai hea nga whakairo Dove?,"The correct answer is **B: I te whare karakia** (In the church).

The passage states: ""I roto i te whare karakia, he whakapakoko kukupa māpere nei kei runga i ētahi urupā"" which translates to ""In the church, there is a marble dove statue on some graves.""
"
He aha te momo visa e hiahiatia ai e te tangata te whakaatu i te taunakitanga o te tautoko moni e tika ana?,"The correct answer is **D: Visa ākonga**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Mō te nuinga o ngā iwi, me whai reta whakaaetanga mai i te kuratini e hiahiatia ana, me ngā kōrero tautoko ā-pūtea e taunaki ana i a koe anō mō te tau tuatahi o tō tohu."" This translates to ""For most people, you need an acceptance letter from the desired university, and financial support information that supports yourself for the first year of your degree."" This requirement is directly linked to student visas.
"
Ko wai e tino hiahiatia ana he visa whānui?,"The correct answer is **C: He Ākonga ao whānui** (A general international student).

The passage explicitly states that studying abroad as an international student usually requires a longer stay than tourism and therefore necessitates a visa, and often one that is more comprehensive than a tourist visa. The passage also mentions specific requirements for student visas, highlighting their distinct nature.
"
Āhea koe e tino māharahara ai ki nga waeroa?,"The best answer is **A: I roto i ngā marama raumati**.

The passage explicitly states ""Inarā i te raumati, me mataara koe ki ngā naenae..."" (In the summer, you must be alert to sandflies...). While the other options are related to the context of the passage (hiking, forests, driving), the primary time to be concerned is *during the summer months*.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, me aha koe kia kore ai e mahi kia kore ai e ārai i ngā waeroa i a koe e taraiwa ana i te ngahere?","The correct answer is **A: He roa rawa te tuwhera o nga tatau o te waka** (The doors of the car are open for too long).

The passage states that even a few seconds of open doors while entering a vehicle in a warm rainforest area are enough for mosquitoes to get inside. This directly implies that the solution is to minimize the time the doors are open.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā tauākī e whai ake nei i runga i ngā Sundarbans ehara i te tika?","The correct answer is **B: Ko te hawhe o tōna rohe tāpeke e hīpokina ana i roto i te repe**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that one-third of the Sundarbans' 3,850 km2 area is covered by water bodies/swamps, not half.
The other options are all correct:

*   **A**: The passage mentions they are some of the last remaining strong forests.
*   **C**: The passage explicitly states that the Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forests in the world.
*   **D**: The passage states there are 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer, confirming that there are more deer than tigers."
Ko tēhea wāhanga o te ngahere e takoto ana i roto i te rohe o Indian?,"The correct answer is **A: Papa Ā-Motu o Sundarbans**.

The passage states: ""Ko te ingoa o te wāhanga ngahere kei te rohe Inia, ko Sundarbans National Park."" (The part of the forest in the Indian region is called Sundarbans National Park.)
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko wai te hunga e tino mōhio ana ki te reo Ingarihi?","Based on the provided text, the answer is **B: Ngā tāngata taitamariki i te pakeketanga**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""He nui ngā whenua katoa e matatau katoa ana ki te reo Ingarihi, ā, he nui atu anō ngā whenua kei reira te mātauranga here - inarā ki roto i ngā rangatahi."" This translates to: ""There are many countries where everyone is fluent in English, and even more countries where there is knowledge of it - especially among young people.""

This clearly indicates that young people (rangatahi) are particularly knowledgeable in English in many countries.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te uaua ki te whakahua?","Ko te whakautu tika ko: **B: Ngā Wāhitau**

E ai ki te wāhanga, ""I te nuinga o te wā he māma ake te mārama ki ngā kupu tuhituhi tēnā i ngā kupu kōrero. E pono pū ana tēnei mō te āhuatanga ki ngā wāhi noho, i te nuinga o te wā he uaua ki te whakahua tika."" Nō reira, ko ngā wāhitau te mea e uaua ana ki te whakahua.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te āhuatanga pai mō te tangata haere e whakamahere ana ki te hopu pahi mai i te teihana ā-rohe?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **B: Kei te anga atu te kaihaere ki Bumthang me wehe i te 7**.

Ko te take i tika ai tēnei whakautu:

*   E ai ki te whiti, ka wehe ngā pahi ki Jakar/Bumthang i waenganui i te 6.30 ki te 7.30. Ko te kōwhiringa B e kī ana kei te anga atu te tangata haere ki Bumthang me wehe i te 7, e ōrite ana ki ngā kōrero i roto i te whiti.

Ngā take kāore i tika ētahi atu kōwhiringa:

*   A: Ahakoa e kī ana te whiti ka wehe ngā pahi ki Jakar, kāore he kōrero mēnā kua hokona kētia e te tangata haere he tīkiti.
*   C: Ahakoa e kī ana te whiti ka taea te tuari tēkehi ki Paro, kāore he kōrero mēnā me wehe i muri i te 11.
*   D: Kāore he kōrero i roto i te whiti mēnā kei te anga atu te tangata haere ki te rawhiti, ā, kāore hoki he kōrero mēnā me tae ki te teihana i mua i te 6:20."
He aha te tohutohu pai mō tētahi tūruhi e hiahia ana ki te haere ki te rawhiti mai i te teihana pahi?,"The correct answer is **B: Hokona he tīkiti tōmua**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""I runga i te noho kī o ngā pahi waenga-rohe i te nuinga o ngā wā, he rautaki pai te hoko tīkiti ētahi rā i mua."" (Due to the inter-district buses being quite full most of the time, it's a good strategy to buy tickets some days in advance.)

The other options are incorrect based on the information given:

*   **A: Ka haere anake ngā pahi i muri i te 8:30:** The passage says buses going north (including Jakar/Bumthang) leave between 6:30 and 7:30. It doesn't give specific times for buses going *east*.
*   **C: He maha nga pahi e haere ana puta noa te rā:** The passage implies that buses are often full, suggesting limited capacity or frequency.
*   **D: Ko te Taxi tiritiri pea te tikanga tino atamai o te haere:** The passage recommends shared taxis for *nearby* locations like Paro and Punkha, not necessarily for a longer journey to the east.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei kōrero e kore e tika te whakaahua o Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **C: He āheikore nā te waka rererangi.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Timbuktu *does* have an airport (""he tauranga waka rererangi ki reira""). This contradicts the statement that it is inaccessible by air. The other options can all be supported by information in the passage, therefore C is the best response."
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka taea te Uru atu te Taone e te waka rererangi** (The city is accessible by airplane).

The passage states: ""...ā, he tauranga waka rererangi ki reira."" (and it has an airport). The other options are either directly contradicted or not supported by the text.
"
I te wā anō i whakaritea ai ngā whakataetae Olympics o te raumati? ,"The correct answer is **D: Hōngongoi 2020**.

The passage states ""...i te mutunga o te Māihe ko te nuinga o ngā kaupapa here whakakorenga huaketo kāore i toro ki te Hurae 2020, i te wā i whakaritea mai ai ngā kēmu taumāhekeheke o te ao."" This translates to ""by the end of March, most cancellation policies due to the virus did not extend to July 2020, when the Olympic games were scheduled.""
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, I te wā āhea ka huri ai tētahi kōpaki hei hau-ā-rangi?","The correct answer is **D: I muri i te whakapā atu ki te whenua**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""nā wai ka āwhiowhio ka tae ana ki te whenua"" - indicating the turning into a tornado happens **when it reaches the ground**.

Therefore, **D** is the best answer."
Ko tēhea o ēnei he āhuatanga tika o te tornado?,"Based on the provided text (P):

*   ""Ka puta ngā hau kaha (100-200 mairo/haora te nuinga)..."" - This supports option A, that tornadoes create winds around 100-200 mph.
*   ""...e āhei ana te hiki i ngā mea nui ki te rangi, e kawea ana i te nekehanga o te awhiowhio."" - This supports option B, that tornadoes can move with heavy objects.

The text states that tornadoes *start* as columns of rising air, not that they remain that way *after* touching the ground (contradicting C). The text doesn't say they push air *out* (contradicting D).

Therefore, the best answer is **B: I ētahi wā e neke ana me ngā ahanoa taumaha** (Sometimes they move with heavy objects).
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, mai i te wāhi e whiwhi tohutohu ai te tangata haere e pā ana ki te āhuatanga tōrangapū i to rātau taone ūnga?","The correct answer is **D: Mai i to rātau ake kāwanatanga**.

The passage states: ""Ka hiahia hoki pea koe ki te aro atu ki ngā tohutohu o ngā kāwanatanga atu i tō ake, engari kei te hoahoatia ō rātou tohutohu mō te hunga nō tō rātou whenua ake."" This directly indicates that travellers should consider the advice from their own government.
"
"Mēnā he tohutohu haere, he aha te mea e kore e taea e te tangata ke te wheako?","The best answer is **D: Ngā mōhiohio taipitopito e pā ana ki te āhuatanga tōrangapū o te whenua**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that travel advisories are ""a general overview of the political situation of a country."" And ""Considerations are discriminatory and overly broad, without deep or narrow insight."" This implies that they *lack* detailed information.
*   The passage explicitly mentions that both travel health insurance and travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
*   The passage mentioned ""a very brief overview of a country’s political situation."""
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea momo haere te iti rawa e hiahiatia ana he āwhina tāpui mai i tētahi māngai haere?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **A: He haerenga ki tētahi hui mahi i tētahi taone kua tae atu te kaihaereere**.

Anei te take:

*   **A** E ai ki te kōrero, he pai ake te whakamahi i tētahi kaiwhakahaere haerenga mēnā he tini ngā whakaritenga haerenga, he ārai reo, me ētahi atu. Mena kua tae atu te tangata ki taua tāone i mua, kaore e hiahiatia he awhina i te māngai haerenga, mehemea he tino uaua te haerenga.
*   **B, C, me D** E tohu ana i ngā ahuatanga e whai hua ai te āwhina a tētahi kaiwhakahaere haerenga. Ko te pūtea whakapau nui, te ārai reo, me te haerenga tuatahi ki rāwāhi ka nui ake pea te matatini, ka hiahiatia he tohungatanga."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea tauari e tino whai hua mai i te āwhina a te māngai haere?","The correct answer is **B: Ina hiahia te haere ki te tāpui i tētahi whakawhānuitanga motuhake mo te wā tuatahi**

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""A 19th-century travel center has been identified. A travel organizer is usually a good option for a trip that will move beyond a traveler's previous experience of nature, culture, language, or poor countries.""
*   Option B describes a situation where the traveler is looking for a unique or specialized experience (a ""whakawhānuitanga motuhake""), which fits the scenario where a travel agent would be most helpful.
*   The other options describe scenarios where a travel agent's help might be less crucial:
    *   A: Booking flights to their hometown is a simple task.
    *   C: Speaking the local language reduces the need for assistance.
    *   D: Familiarity with cultural differences makes independent travel easier."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te āwhina i te haere ki te karo i te matekiri i a ia e haere ana ki ngā wāhi hou?","The correct answer is **C: E haere ana ki aua ture ōrite ki te wāhi e noho ai rātau i**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that things are different in new places compared to home. To avoid frustration or offense, you need to be aware of these differences. Option C directly contradicts this, stating that you should adhere to the same rules as your home, which is exactly what the passage warns against. The correct translation of answer C in English would be: ""Adhering to those same laws where they live."" That is not right.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te tūmanako i ngā paerewa ōrite ki te wāhi i ahu mai ai rātou**: Expecting the same standard as where they came from is against the text and would get them matekiri.
*   **B: He hiahia ki te whakamātau i ngā kai tauhou**: Being willing to try new foods is a good thing when travelling but is not addressed in the text.
*   **D: Kei te karo i te rangahau o mua i runga i te nohoanga**: Avoiding preliminary research on the seating is not addressed in the text.

Therefore, understanding and adapting to the different norms of a new place is key to avoiding problems.
"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i roto i te wāhanga nei, he aha te momo tangata ka raru ina haere ki tētahi whenua kē?","Based on the paragraph, the correct answer is:

**C: Ko tētahi tangata e hinengaro kati ana (Someone who is close-minded)**

Here's why:

*   The paragraph emphasizes that things will be different when you travel: customs, laws, food, transportation, etc.
*   A close-minded person is less likely to be accepting of these differences and therefore more likely to experience frustration or even offend the local culture.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Tētahi tangata e pīrangi ana ki ngā kai hāngai (Someone who only likes specific foods):** While picky eaters might struggle, the paragraph discusses broader cultural differences beyond just food.
*   **B: Ko tētahi tangata i tipu ake i te huringa (Someone who grew up in transition):** Someone who grew up in transition is likely adaptable and open to change, making them *less* likely to have problems.
*   **D: Tētahi tangata e ngahau ana ki te ako (Someone who enjoys learning):** Someone who enjoys learning is *more* likely to adapt well to a new culture and enjoy the differences."
Ko tehea o ēnei tohutohu e kore e tūtohutia mō ngā kaihaereere e haere ana ki tētahi whenua whanaketanga mō te wā tuatahi?,"The passage says:

*   Don't underestimate cultural differences.
*   Initially, stick to quality hotels, good food, and good services for comfort.
*   Don't sleep on a mattress on the ground unless you know the country.
*   If tenting, bring a camping cot or hammock.

The passage suggests avoiding sleeping directly on the ground without protection.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: Me mōhio koe ki te ao kararehe paetata i mua i te moe i runga i te whenua**. While understanding the local wildlife is generally good advice, the passage focuses on using a barrier (cot or hammock) *instead* of directly sleeping on the ground, not simply knowing what animals are around. The other options are all directly supported by the passage.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e kore e whakahuatia hei mea e tika ana kia whakapau kaha ai te tangata ina haere ki tētahi whenua e whanake haere ana?,"The correct answer is **A: Kai kāhua-uru**.

Here's why:

*   **P states:** The advice focuses on quality accommodation, good food, and good services for comfort and adjustment initially. It suggests a specific type of bedding (tent mattress) when camping.
*   **The question asks:** What is NOT mentioned as something to focus on when traveling to a developing country?
*   **""Kai kāhua-uru"" (Western-style food)** is NOT specifically mentioned as a priority. The advice only suggests eating good food, which doesn't necessarily mean Western food. The rest of the options are direct instructions."
"Ko tēhea o ngā kōwhiringa e whai ake nei te mea pai rawa mō te kaipupuri here e hiahia ana ki tētahi tārua mariko o tōna here, engari kāore pea he uru ki te ipurangi?","The best option for a policyholder who wants a digital copy but may not have internet access is:

**C: Te pupuri i tētahi tārua i rokiroki i roto i te mahara o tō rātou pona (Keeping a copy stored in their laptop's memory)**

Here's why:

*   **A: hoatu tārua ki tētahi hoa haere (Giving a copy to a travel companion)** - This is helpful, but relies on the companion having the copy and being available. It's not a *digital* copy the policyholder can directly access on their own device.
*   **B: Īmēra ana i a rātau anō he tārua (Emailing themselves a copy)** - This requires internet access to retrieve the email.
*   **D: penapena ana i tētahi tārua ki te “cloud” (Saving a copy to the ""cloud"")** - This *always* requires internet access to retrieve the copy.

Storing it on the laptop's memory allows access without needing the internet. The original text specifically mentions this option as a way to access the information when the internet is unavailable.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e kore e kitea i roto i te kaupapahere?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **D: Wāhitau īmēra a te kaipupuri kaupapahere.**

Ko te take:

*   E kī ana te kōrero me whakaatu te kaupapa here i te īmēra me ngā nama waea kia whiwhi tohutohu/whakamanatanga hoki mō te tuku kerēme. Ko ēnei e pā ana ki te kaiinihua, ehara i te kaipupuri kaupapahere. Ko ngā kōwhiringa A, B, me C e pā ana ki ngā kōrero whakapā a te kaiinihua. Ko te kōwhiringa D e pā ana ki te kaipupuri kaupapahere, ā, ehara i te mea me whakaatu tōna wāhitau īmēra ki te kaupapahere."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea rahi tōraro e whakaatu ana i te hōputu pikitia e tino whakamahia nuitia ana?","The correct answer is **C: 35 mm tōraro**.

The passage states: ""Ko te tewe aro whānui 35 mm (36 ki te 24 mm te whakaahua takahuri) te mea kei te tino whakamahia."" This directly translates to ""The 35 mm [film format] (36 by 24 mm image area) is the most commonly used.""
"
Ko tēhea o ngā hōputu whitiāhua e whai ake nei e tuku ana i te taumira e ōrite ana ki tētahi DSLR?,"The correct answer is **A: Whitiāhua 35 mm**.

The passage states that 35mm film is ""āhua ōrite te ariari ki tētahi DSLF o nāianei"" (roughly comparable in resolution to a modern DSLR). While the passage does later mention a larger format film (6x6 cm), it explicitly compares the resolution of 35mm film to DSLRs.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei te hipanga whakamutunga i te tīmatanga o tētahi umanga tuhituhi haere?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **C: Hangaia tō ake paetukutuku**.

E ai ki te wāhanga, ko te hanga paetukutuku ko te mahi whakamutunga i muri i te whakapakari i ngā pūkenga i runga i te paetukutuku kua roa e whakaeretia ana i roto i ēnei mahi me te taunga ki te hōputu me te kotikoti i runga i te ipurangi.
"
"I te wā e tīmata ana i tētahi pakihi tuhi haerenga, ko tēhea o ngā āheinga e whai ake nei e tika ana kia whakahoutia i te tuatahi?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **B: Hōputu tukutuku**.

E ai ki te whiti P, ko te ""huarahi māmā"" ki te whakatū pākihi tuhituhi haerenga ko te whakapai ake i ō pukenga ki tētahi whārangi ipurangi kua roa nei e mahi ana i roto i ēnei mahi. Ko te tikanga, me mātua ako koe i te **hōputu tukutuku** me te **kotikoti** i runga i te ipurangi i te tuatahi. Ko te hanga i tō ake pae tukutuku me te rangitaki he āhuatanga ka puta i muri mai. Ko te whakarerekē kei roto i te kotikoti, nō reira, ko te hōputu tukutuku te mea matua i te tuatahi.
"
He aha te momo āhuarangi e kitea nuitia ana ngā Raruraru Whakamātautau?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngā āhuarangi wera** (Hot climates).

The passage states: ""ka āhua noa ngā raru kōpiro ki ngā āhuarangi wera"" which translates to ""gastrointestinal problems are common in hot climates"".
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ka āhei te mārakerake auau ki te āraitanga o te aha?","The correct answer is **B: Germs Paetata (Local Germs)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""Ki te kāinga, i runga i tēnei huranga ki ngā moroiti o tērā wāhi, ākene pea he ārai mate kē tāu ki ēnā."" This translates to ""At home, due to exposure to the microbes of that place, you might already have immunity to those."" This directly links exposure to local microbes with the development of immunity. ""Germs Paetata"" refers to local germs, which aligns with the meaning of the answer.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he painga o te haere i roto i te rohe o Rōpū?,"The best answer is **C: Kei te karo i ngā wāhitaki mana uruwhenua maha**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that within the Schengen zone, you can cross borders without going through passport control (""ehara i te mea me haere anō mā ngā tirotiro kaitiaki uruwhenua"").

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Kei te karo i ngā taupānga visa maha:** While having a Schengen visa simplifies things compared to needing individual visas for each country, you still need to apply for a Schengen visa. The passage mentions that you *don't* have to apply for visas for *each* Schengen member country.
*   **B: Tiaki moni ana:** The passage actually suggests the opposite - that applying for individual visas for each country would cost *more* time and money.
*   **D: Kāore he whakaritenga uruwhenua:** This is incorrect. You still need a passport (and potentially a Schengen visa, depending on your nationality) to enter the Schengen zone in the first place. The benefit is you don't need to show it *between* countries within the zone.
"
He aha te mea kua kore e kitea i roto i te urupa o Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **D: Nga taonga** (The treasures).

The passage explicitly states: ""Kāore ngā rawa mīharo o te toma i te noho tonu ki roto rā, engari kua haria ki te Egyptian Museum, ki Cairo."" This translates to ""The wonderful treasures of the tomb are no longer there, but have been taken to the Egyptian Museum, in Cairo.""

While the passage mentions only the head and shoulders of the mummy are visible, it doesn't imply that other parts are *missing* from the tomb. The treasures, however, have been completely removed.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tehea te ūnga o Vancouver e iti rawa te ahuareka ki ngā kaihaereere e mōhio ana ki te utu? ","The correct answer is **C: Te Motu o Bowen**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Bowen Island is a ""rorotu"" (charming) destination. This means it's enjoyable, so it's unlikely to be the least appealing option.
*   The passage praises the ""Moana ki te rangi"" (Sea to Sky) trail, making it an attractive option for outdoor enthusiasts.
*   The passage speaks highly of Whistler as a top skiing destination in North America, despite its cost. This indicates that Whistler is a popular and desirable destination, even with the high prices.
*   While the passage does not explicitly state any problems with Granville Island, it does say that Granville Island is just a place to catch the ferry to get to Bowen Island. This suggests that Granville Island itself might not be a primary destination.

Considering the information provided in the passage, Bowen Island appears to be the least appealing option for travellers who are aware of cost, as the passage only mentions Granville Island being a place to catch a ferry to Bowen Island.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea ūnga e tino tuku ana i tētahi wheako Vancouver tūturu?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **A: Te Motu o Bowen**.

He aha ai:

*   E kī ana te tuhinga ko te Motu o Bowen he ""haerenga ā-rā rorotu, he haerenga mutunga wiki rānei e whakarato ana i te kōreti, te hīkoi maunga, ngā toa, ngā whare kai, aha atu."" E whakaatu ana tēnei i tētahi wheako Vancouver tūturu, mā te whakakotahi i ngā mahi ki waho me ngā wharekai me ngā toa.

He aha i kore ai i tika ētahi atu kōwhiringa:

*   Ko te whio he mea nui te wahi i te ara hīkoi, mai i te Moana ki te rangi. He nui ngā utu ki Whistler.
*   Ko Downtown Vancouver ehara i te mea kua whakahuatia ake i roto i te wāhanga hei tūnga e tuku ana i tētahi wheako Vancouver tūturu.
*   Ko te Motu o Granville kei te pokapū o te tāone o Vancouver."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, āhea haere ai nga kaihoko ki nga hinganga mehemea kai te rapu rātau i ngā tirohanga kāore i te mōhiotia?","The passage states that during the rainy season (November to March), the volume of water is high and the Falls are spectacular. However, it also says that the high water volume can obscure the view of the Falls.

Therefore, if visitors are looking for unobstructed views, they should avoid the rainy season. Option D, ""I waho o te wā marangai"" (Outside of the rainy season), is the correct answer.

So the answer is **D: I waho o te wā marangai**
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te taha ki te haere ki Wikitōria Falls i waenganui o Whiringa me Mati?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā tirohanga kāore i te mōhiotia o ngā hinganga (Unclear views of the falls)**.

The passage states: ""Engari hoki, nā te nui o te wai i pērā ai, ā, ka rehurehu noa tō titiro atu ki ngā wairere- kei ngā wāhi katoa!"" This translates to ""However, because of the large amount of water, your view of the falls will be blurry - everywhere!"". Therefore, during the rainy season (November to March), the views of the falls are obscured.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i te taunakitia ina whakamahi i tētahi drone ki te pikitia?","Based on the passage, the answer is **D: E whakaata ana i ngā wāhi pūruru anake e kore ai e kitea te drone.**

Here's why:

* **The passage advises against certain actions:** The passage explicitly states that leaving a drone near an airport or on a property is almost always a bad idea, *even if it's not illegal*. This suggests avoiding actions that could be perceived as irresponsible or intrusive, regardless of strict legality. Option D, filming only in areas where the drone is not seen, directly goes against the intent of filming.
* **The passage recommends:** The passage also recommends inquiring about filming permissions and licenses before using a drone.

The other options (A, B, and C) align with the advice in the passage.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, kei hea ngā wāhi tino pai hei whitiāhua mā te whakamahi i te drone?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **D: I ngā wāhi kua whiwhi koe i ngā whakaaetanga o mua mō.**

E ai ki te wāhanga, me ui atu koe i mua rawa mō ngā whakaaetanga, ngā raihana tāpiri e hiahiatia ana i mua i te mau kiriata. Ko te tikanga, ko te mahi tika ko te tiki whakaaetanga i mua i te rere.
"
"I runga anō i te haerenga, ehara i te tika te tauākī e pā ana ki te whakaritenga rēhitatanga mō te tukanga visa?","The best answer is **D: I ētahi wāhi, ka taea e ngā hotera o te rohe te whakahaere i te rēhitatanga**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states: ""Ki ngā tini whenua me tētahi ture pērā, ka whakarite ngā hōtēra ā-rohe i te rēhitatanga"". This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   A: ""Mēnā kei te noho koe i ngā whare tūruhi, kāore pea koe e hiahia ki te rēhita"". While this *can* be true, the passage states only ""I ētahi atu wā, ko te hunga ō waho i ngā nohoanga tūruhi anake me rēhita"". This suggests that in some cases those staying in tourist accomodation still have to register.
*   B: ""Me rēhita ngā whenua katoa ki ngā mana ā rohe"". The passage implies registration is only required for certain countries.
*   C: ""E hiahiatia ana pea he toro ki ngā tari nekeneke"". While the passage mentions ""tari manene"", this is just one possibility. Other options include the local police, or hotels organising registration.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate and well-supported by the provided text."
Ko tēhea o ēnei ehara i te wāhi tūruhi ka haere pea ki te whakahaere i to rātau rēhitatanga?,"The correct answer is **C: He tari poutāpeta paetata**.

Here's why:

*   **A: He teihana pirihimana o te rohe:** The passage mentions needing to fill out forms with the local police in some cases.
*   **B: Te hōtēra e noho ana rātau:** The passage states that local hotels often arrange registration.
*   **D: Nga tari nekeneke:** The passage mentions you may have to fill out a paper at an immigration office.

Post offices are not mentioned in the provided text, and would not be associated with foreign registration.
"
Ko wai e kore e whai hua i te mahi tūao i a ia e haere ana?,"The correct answer is **B: Ko tētahi tangata e kimi ana i tētahi utu nui**.

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes that volunteering while traveling is *not* primarily about financial gain. It highlights cultural exchange, personal growth, skill development, and potentially reducing travel costs through offered accommodation and food.
*   Someone seeking a high salary would be disappointed by volunteer work, as the passage states most volunteer positions offer no or minimal pay.
*   The other options align with the benefits described in the passage:
    *   **A:** Meeting new people is mentioned.
    *   **C:** Developing new skills is mentioned.
    *   **D:** Room and board are listed as a potential benefit of some volunteer positions."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he pēhea te tono i a rātau e whai hua ana ki tētahi haere i runga i te tahua?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **C: I ētahi wā ka tukuna te rūma me te poari**.

Ko te take: Kei te kōrero te whiti P e pā ana ki ngā painga o te tūao i te wā e hāereere ana, me te āhua o te tūao e āwhina ana ki te whakaroa i te tahua pūtea. E ai ki te whiti, ""he maha ngā mahi tūao ka tuku i te nōhanga me te kai"". Ko te tikanga o tēnei, i ētahi wā ka whakawhiwhia e ngā mahi tūao te nohoanga (rūma) me te kai (poari), ā, he mea tino āwhina tēnei mō te hunga e hiahia ana ki te hāere i runga i te tahua pūtea.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, He aha te mea e kiia ana he rerekē i te haerenga noa ki Walt Disney World?","The correct answer is **C: E tārewa ana i te katoa o te haere i runga i te āhuatanga Disney**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes the ""typical"" Disney World trip as staying within the Disney property for the entire week (""kāore e wehe i te takiwā o Disney""). This means spending the entire vacation immersed in the Disney experience. Any deviation from this (like staying outside Disney property) would be considered different from the norm.
* The other options aren't necessarily deviations: Option A isn't possible, since that describes the normal vacation to Walt Disney World. Option B and D can both be done."
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki te Ao Disney ehara i te tika?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka taea te whakawhiti i ngā tīkiti Papa-hopper ki ētahi atu haere**.

Here's why:

*   The passage clearly states: ""Ahakoa kei te whakamahia whānuitia tēnei mahi, kei te aukatia e Disney: he kore-whakawhiti ngā tīkiti."" This means Disney tickets are non-transferable.

The other options are all mentioned or implied in the passage:

*   B: He nohoanga i runga i te pae e wātea ana is not specifically mentioned, but the idea of a vacation package implies the presence of on-site facilities.
*   C: Tērā ētahi pahi e wātea ana ki te kawe haere mai i te wāhi rererangi ki te āhuatanga: The passage mentions taking a bus from Orlando airport to a Disney hotel.
*   D: Ka kitea ngā tīkiti rā-maha i ngā paetukutuku hoko: The passage mentions finding multi-day Park Hopper tickets on websites like eBay and Craigslist."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā take e whai ake nei kāore pea e hipa i roto i tētahi karaehe whakangungu ngaio, i ngā tānga rānei?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Ora o te Wilderness**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states:** ""He tini ngā pukapuka me ngā makahīni e kōrero ana mō te mōrehutanga ki te wao, heoi ehara i te mea he nui ngā putanga e pā ana ki ngā wāhi pakanga."" This indicates that wilderness survival, while a common topic, isn't the primary focus of training for conflict zones.
*   **The passage mentions:**
    *   ""whakangungu ngaio tētahi e whakamahere ana i te toronga atu ki tētahi whenua e whai whakaarohia ana he wāhi pakanga"" (professional training for traveling to a conflict zone). This implies conflict-zone-specific tactics (C).
    *   ""he nui te āwhina tuatahi"" (extensive first aid) (B).
    *   ""he whakatau kei roto"" (decision making is included) (D). Role-playing would be considered to be a form of decision making.

Therefore, wilderness survival is the least likely to be covered extensively in professional conflict zone training materials or courses."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kaupapa e whai ake nei ka hipahia i roto i tētahi karaehe whakangungu ngaio?","The correct answer is **A: Āwhina tuatahi**.

The passage explicitly states that professional training courses ""often include a substantial amount of first aid."" While it mentions conflict zones (B), wilderness survival (C), and potentially hostile environments (D indirectly), only first aid is directly identified as a topic covered in the training class.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te kōwhiringa tino pai mo te karo i te wai tāhae?","The passage presents several methods for purifying water and states that some might be better than others depending on the specific threats. It also suggests that if you're concerned, buying bottled water from a known company is a good option.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Wai kōhua mō ngā meneti maha (Boiling water for many minutes):** The passage states that in some places boiling the water is enough for one minute, which implies that in other places you need to boil the water for more minutes.
*   **B: Hoko wai pounamu (Buy bottled water):** The passage directly suggests buying bottled water from a known company if you have concerns about water quality.
*   **C: wai kōhua mo te meneti kotahi (Boiling water for one minute):** The passage mention that the water in some place need to be boiled for one minute, but that would not be enough for all places.
*   **D: Ka tohu i te wai mō ngā tuma tauwhāiti (Treating water for specific threats):** This is too generic and requires more knowledge than what the excerpt provides

While the excerpt mentions boiling for a certain amount of minutes, it states the ideal method to ensure safety would be to buy a bottled water.

Therefore, the best answer is **B: Hoko wai pounamu (Buy bottled water)**."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea e kore e taea ahakoa mo nga kaikau pūkenga?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: Kei te haere ki tētahi o nāianei (Going against a current)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions that people often drown from exhaustion when trying to swim **against** the rip current (ia kauere). It also states that swimming **back** is often not as difficult as swimming against the current. The passage implies that even for skilled swimmers, fighting directly against a rip current can be extremely challenging and dangerous.
"
Me aha koe ki te mau koe i tētahi o nāianei?,"Based on the information in passage P, the best answer is **A: Whakamātauria kia puta atu i te rere mā te ū ki tētahi atu aronga, kātahi ka kaukau atu ki te takutai i te tikanga** (Try to get out of the current by heading in a different direction, and then swim to shore normally).

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Ka puta tonu atu koe i te ia, ko te kaukau kia hoki atu kāore e uaua ake i te kaukau i te nuinga o te wā. Ngana ki te aro atu ki tētahi wāhi kāore koe e mau anō"" (You can get out of the current, and swimming back is no more difficult than swimming usually. Try to head to a place where you are no longer caught). This suggests swimming in a different direction to escape the current and then swim back to shore.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tere ake te kauhoe ki te mea o nāianei** (Swim faster with the current) - This goes against the advice of trying to escape the current.

*   **C: Kaukau ki te ahunga hangai** (Swim in the opposite direction) - While the passage doesn't explicitly forbid this, it implies this is a tiring and likely ineffective strategy. It highlights the danger of exhaustion from trying to swim directly against the current.

*   **D: kaukau i raro i te mata** (Swim underwater) - The passage does not mention anything about swimming underwater to escape the current. This is unlikely to be helpful and potentially dangerous.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea tauwāhi e haere ai ki tētahi maka, he whakangahau hararei whai painga?","Based on the provided passage, the correct answer is:

**A: He taone i te taha o Danube**

The passage explicitly mentions taking a river cruise to ""manawa reka"" (charming) towns on the Danube as an example of a good river cruise for travelling. The other options are mentioned in the passage as well, but the Danube is the only location specifically described as an example for an enjoyable holiday.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei e kore e tūtohutia mō ngā wāhine e haere ana ki te rohe?","The correct answer is **A: Kia kaua e kōrerorero i te tūnga taua**.

Here's why:

*   The passage focuses on women's safety and how they should handle unwanted advances in the Sahel region. The passage discusses the cultural norms, appearance, and handling unwanted attention. The passage doesn't mention anything about discussing your relationship status with people.

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned in the passage:

*   **B: Kia mōhio he rerekē te ahurea ka whakaoho ai i te kaha o te iwi** The passage explicitly states the importance of women being aware of the cultural differences and actions that may be misinterpreted as flirtatious.
*   **C: Kaua e mau i te Hurai kōhiko** The passage recommends wearing a ring (but not an expensive one).
*   **D: Whakamahia te uaua ina hiahiatia** The passage directly says to be firm in your refusal and not be afraid to stand up for yourself (even with cultural differences, unwanted advances are not okay!)"
"I runga anō i te rohe i whakaahuatia i roto i te wāhanga, he aha te tohutohu āwhina mō ngā wāhine haere?","Based on the text, the best answer is:

**D: I te take o ngā nekehanga tē hiahiatia, kia kaha ki te huri i ngā tāngata**

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes that women should ""Kia kaha ki te whakakahore i te tāne, ā, kaua e mataku ki te tū pakari ai (ahakoa ngā rerekētanga ahurea, kāore tonu i te pai!)"". This directly translates to standing your ground and being firm in unwanted advances.

Here's why the other options are incorrect or misleading:

*   **A: E mōhio ana koe he kore noa iho te whai i a ia:** The passage emphasizes respecting cultural differences but does not suggest that unwelcome advances should be ignored.

*   **B: Wear he rīngi nui hei tohu i te Tūnga taua:** The passage says to wear a ring, but specifically *not* a very expensive one.

*   **C: Kia mōhio koe ki ngā rerekētanga ahurea e hua ana kia kore koe e tū i tō whenua:** This contradicts the advice of being firm and not being afraid to stand your ground. While cultural sensitivity is important, the passage makes it clear that this should not come at the expense of personal safety and boundaries."
"I runga anō i te wāhanga, tērā pea ka hiahiatia e tētahi kaiwhakaahua kararehe hei whakamahi i tētahi arotahi motuhake?","The correct answer is **A: Mēnā kei te whakaahua rātou i ngā Waihanga iti rawa**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Mēnā e whakaahua ana koe i ngā kararehe kei te taiao, me mau karaehe roa te kāmera, ahakoa ērā pērā ki ngā kāhui manu me ngā ngārara itiiti nei, me mau i ētahi atu karaehe."" This directly implies that when photographing small creatures (ngārara itiiti - small insects, or ""Waihanga iti rawa"" using similar terms), a specific type of lens besides long lenses is needed.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mēnā kei te whakamahia ngā whakaahua mō ngā take arumoni (If the photos are used for commercial purposes)** - The passage mentions that there are laws about taking photos for commercial use, but it doesn't state that a specific lens is required for commercial purposes.
*   **C: Kia whakaahuatia nga kararehe, he whakamā (To photograph animals that are shy)** - The passage mentions that some animals are shy, but it doesn't say a special lens is needed for shy animals.
*   **D: Mēnā he ture motuhake tā te pāka e pā ana ki te whakaahua waiora (If the park has specific rules about wildlife photography)** - The passage states there are laws regarding taking photos for commercial use, but it doesn't say that there are park rules that require the use of a special lens."
Ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i kōrerotia i roto i te whakawhitinga hei uaua tērā pea mō ngā kaiwhakaahua kararehe?,"The correct answer is **B: E mahi ana ki ngā kararehe whakatuki**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Kimi ana i ētahi kararehe pātata (Finding nearby animals)** - The passage states ""He uaua te kimi i ngā kararehe hou"" (It's difficult to find new animals), which implies difficulty in finding animals. ""Pātata"" meaning ""nearby"" is related to this.
*   **C: E hiahiatia ana te momo arotahi (The type of lens needed)** - The passage discusses the need for long lenses and other lenses depending on the subject.
*   **D: E mahi ana i ngā taiao tūkino pea (Working in potentially harmful environments)** - The passage mentions ""Ko te taiao he makariri, he wera, he taraweti anō rānei"" (The environment is cold, hot, or wet), implying challenging or potentially harmful environments.
*   **B: E mahi ana ki ngā kararehe whakatuki (Working with aggressive animals)** - While the passage mentions that some animals are shy or easily startled (""Ko ngā kararehe pāwhara he whakamā, he ririhau rānei""), it doesn't specifically say that dealing with aggressive animals is a challenge.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei ka iti ake pea ngā raruraru mō tētahi atekōkiri e haere ana i te maunga?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā waka taumaha** (Heavy vehicles).

Here's why:

*   **Ngā waka taumaha (Heavy vehicles):** Heavier vehicles have more traction. This is crucial on icy or snowy roads. The weight helps the tires grip the surface better, reducing the risk of skidding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **Te wā iti (Limited time):** Having limited time would *increase* the risk. Drivers might rush, making them more likely to make mistakes in hazardous conditions.
*   **Ōritetanga e hiahiatia ana (Required consistency):** While consistency is generally good for driving, it doesn't directly address the specific challenges of driving in icy or snowy mountain conditions.
*   **kua whakahekea te Aritanga (Reduced visibility):** Reduced visibility makes driving in any conditions more dangerous, and especially so in challenging environments like snowy mountains."
He aha pea ka noho ōrite tonu mō te tāke moni whiwhi puta noa i ngā whenua maha?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā Mokatere (Treaties)**.

Here's why:

*   **Tax Treaties (Ngā Mokatere):** Tax treaties are agreements between countries that aim to avoid double taxation and clarify tax rules for individuals and businesses operating across borders. They can standardize aspects of income taxation between the treaty partners, ensuring the same tax treatment across multiple countries.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **Hanganga (Infrastructure):** Infrastructure is not directly related to income tax.
*   **Te wāhi e kōnae ai koe (Where you file):** The location where you file your taxes is based on the country of residence or citizenship.
*   **Ngā Taiapa (Barriers):** Barriers are the opposite of uniformity.

Therefore, the only option that could lead to consistency in income tax treatment across countries is tax treaties."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, mēnā kei te mahi koe ki rāwāhi, engari i tētahi atu wāhi, ka whakakōnaetia e koe ō tāke moni whiwhinga?","The correct answer is **A: Kei hea koe i te nuinga o te wā.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:**  ""Mēnā ehara koe i tētahi takawaenga kāwanatanga, ki te mahi koe ki tāwāhi i te nuinga o te wā me whakarite koe i te tāke moni whiwhi ki te motu e noho nā koe.""  (If you are not a government intermediary, if you work abroad most of the time you must settle your income tax with the nation where you reside).

This means your tax obligations are determined by where you live ""most of the time"" (ngā nuinga o te wā).  Therefore, to determine where you'll be taxed, you need to know where you spend the majority of your time.

Ko tēhea o ngā tauākī e whai ake nei kāore e whakaahua tika ana i te Tika o te Ao?,"The correct answer is **D: Kāore e hiahiatia ana ngā whenua kia whai wāhi.**

The passage states: ""Kei te whakaatu ngā whenua e whai wāhi ana i ngā whakaaturanga...""  This clearly indicates that countries *do* participate. The other statements (A, B, and C) are all directly supported by information in the passage. Therefore, D is the only statement that does *not* accurately describe the World Expo.

"Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he ture no te hanganga Tika, ao whānui rānei o te Ao?","The correct answer is **B: Kāore e taea e te whenua kotahi te taurima i ngā takahanga i ia tau** (A single country cannot host the events every year).

Here's why:

* **A: Me whakakite e ngā whakaaturanga ngā hītori me ngā take o te ao** (Exhibits must showcase the history and world issues): The passage states that participating countries showcase art and education related to global issues, culture, or history. So, this statement aligns with the text.
* **B: Kāore e taea e te whenua kotahi te taurima i ngā takahanga i ia tau** (A single country cannot host the events every year): The passage says the events can be held annually, ""...me huri ngā hui i te ao..."" which translates to ""the meetings rotate around the world"". This directly implies that no single country hosts every year.
* **C: Me tae ki te ono marama te roa o ngā takahanga** (Events must last up to six months): The passage states the events last ""mō te toru ki te ono marama rānei"" (for three to six months or so). ""Up to six months"" is not mandatory.
* **D: Kia puritia ai te ataahua, me whai wāhi ngā whenua katoa** (To maintain beauty, all countries must participate): The passage does not discuss the need for *all* countries to participate to maintain beauty.

Therefore, option B is the only one that is explicitly stated as a rule within the provided text.

Mā te mahi ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei ka whakahekea te āheinga ki te whakaeke kararehe?,"Based on the text provided, the best answer is:

**D: E whakakāhore ana i ngā kararehe whai maka kai**

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes that animals are attracted to smells and that you should ""try not to carry or cook fragrant foods and keep the camp clean."" Denying animals access to food, even unintentionally, is directly related to preventing them from approaching and potentially attacking.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: E mau ana i ngā otaota aro (Wearing aromatic plants)**: The passage emphasizes that animals are attracted to smells. Therefore wearing aromatic plants would increase an attack by animals.

*   **B: Tango ana i te peke i te puni (Removing the bag from the camp)**: While removing the bag from the camp might eliminate the bag's contents from the camp, it is still better to deny the animals access to food.

*   **C: Kei te pupuri i tētahi tawhiti 25 whārangi mai i ngā wuruhi (Keeping a distance of 25 pages from wolves):** The text states that you should keep a distance of 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife. Therefore this distance is too short.

"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i kōrerotia i roto i te whakawhitinga hei take pea o ngā whakaekenga o te waiora?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngā kararehe tauhou ki te tangata**

Here's why:

*   **A: Ngā kakara kaha (Strong smells)**: The passage mentions that bears and other animals are attracted to smells, so cooking or carrying smelly food can lead to unwanted attention.
*   **B: Rahunga ki te pupuri tawhiti (Failure to keep distance)**: The passage explicitly states the required distances from animals and that tourists get injured when they don't maintain those distances.
*   **C: Whāngai ana i te waiora (Feeding wildlife)**: The passage advises against feeding or bothering wildlife.
*   **D: Ngā kararehe tauhou ki te tangata (Animals accustomed to humans)**: The passage says animals are used to seeing humans but are still wild and should not be fed or harassed.
