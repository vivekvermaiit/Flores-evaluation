"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Kamiyaabi key saath baaja bajaney key liye kis cheez ko durust tip nahein samjha jaata hay?","The passage clearly states: ""yaad rakho tumhein kaleedon par ziyadah zor sey ungliyan maarney kee zaroorat nahin jaisa keh tez aawaz key liye piano par maarni parti hain. Bajey par izaafi hajam haasil karney key liye aap ziyadah dabao yaa raftaar key saath kamanon kaa istemaal kartey hain.""

This contradicts option A: ""Ezaafi aawaz key liye, jinn kaleedon parr aap martey hein uskey saath zor badhadein"" because it says you *shouldn't* hit the keys harder for more volume.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A**.
"
"Bajaa bajatey waqt, darjah zail mein sey kiss sey aawaz badhaney mein madad miley gee?","Sawal P ke mutabiq, bajey par aawaz badhaney ke liye, aap ziyadah dabao ya raftaar ke saath kamanon ka istemaal kartey hain. Is liye, durust jawab hai:

**A: Mazeed raftaar** (Ziyadah raftaar)
"
Television parr tasweeron ka bardar keon kata hua hota hay?,"Sahi jawab hai: **B: Takehh tasweer mokammal screen ko bhar dey**

Explanation:

Passage mein wazeh taur par bataya gaya hai ke ""Yeh yaqeeni bananay keliye tayaar kiya gayaa hay keh tasveer puri screen ko dhak lay- isee ko over scan kahaa jaataa hay.""  Isliye, television par tasweeron ka border isliye kata hua hota hai taakeh tasveer puri screen ko bhar dey."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail kis masalah ka DVD wazaa mein eek movie ko muntaqil kartey waqt kisi ko samnaa karna pad sakta hay?","Sahi jawab hai **B: Juzwi tor parr zaili unwanaat katein**.

Pura passage overscan ke masle par baat karta hai, jismein TV screen ke kinaron ko kaat diya jaata hai. Iska nateeja yeh hota hai ki jab aap DVD banate hain to, video ke neeche maujood zeli titles (subtitles) puri tarah se nazar nahin aate, yani juzwi tor parr katein.

Isliye B sahi jawab hai.

Lehaza, sahih jawab hai:

B: Trenton
"
Eek haath sey tahreer kardah draft parr kis ki dastakhat zahir hui thee?,"The correct answer is **D: Charles Thomson**.

The passage states: ""ek haath sey tahreer kardah draft, jis par congress key sadar jaan hancok our secretary charlis thomson kee jaanib sey dastakhat kiye gaye"" which translates to ""a handwritten draft, which was signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson""."
"Darjah zail mahalle waqoo mein sey, dunlop broad side akhir mein kahaan pahunchi thee?","The correct answer is **C: London**.

The passage states that a copy of the Dunlop Broadside reached London on August 10th. While the other locations are mentioned in the process of creating and disseminating the document, London is the final destination mentioned in the provided text.
"
Colonel Stark key foji kahaan waqea they?,"Correct Answer: **A: Baadh key kinarey, shumaali sirey parr**

Explanation:

The passage clearly states: ""Stark key aadmiyon nay colonist kee jagah kee shumali hadd key janglay par positions sanbhaal leen."" This translates to: ""Stark's men took positions on the fence at the northern edge of the colonist's location.""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Stark key logon ney apni baadh mein kabb tausee ki thee?","The correct answer is **C: Kam lahar key doraan**.

The passage states: ""Jab jazirah numaa key shumaal mashriqi hissay key saath mestik daryaa key saath nasheebi lahar nay ek khalaa ko khol diyaa, unhon nay jaldi jaldi ek patthar kee chhoti dewaar say janglay ko shumaal kee jaanib wasee kiya...""

This clearly indicates that Stark's men extended their barricade when the low tide revealed a gap.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon cheen ka sabsey ziyadah pur tashaddud zamanah hay?","Sahi jawab hai: **D: Teenon saltanaton ka zamanah**

Ebarat mein wazeh taur par zikr kiya gaya hai ke ""Qadeem cheen kee tareekh mein teen riyasatein sab sey khunreez dauron mein sey ek hay..."" yani Teenon saltanaton ka zamanah sab se ziyada pur tashaddud zamanah tha.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, khaanah badosh marhalah mein dakhil honey wali chiyontiyon ki colony ki foj mein sey kiya sahee hay?","The correct answer is **B: Unkey paas khaney ki kam farahami hoti hay**.

Here's why:

* **P** clearly states: ""Khaaney kee dastiyaab ashyaa mein kamee ho jaaney par colony mein khaanah badoshi kaa marhalah shuroo ho jaataa hay"" (The nomadic phase in a colony begins when there is a lack of available food.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wohh raat mein ghonslah banati hein** - The passage states they march at night and make temporary nests during the day.
* **C: Wohh aisey ghonsley banati hein jo 17 dino key baad badal jaatey hein** - The passage indicates that *each nomadic swarm* lasts about 17 days, not that each individual nest lasts that long. The nests are temporary and change daily.
* **D: Wohh din key doraan march karti hein** - The passage states that they march at night."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsa darjah zail bayaniyah khaanah badosh marhalah key doraan foji chiyontiyon ki caluniyon ki ghonsalah bananey ki aadaton ki durust tor parr akkasi karta hay?","Sahi jawab hai: **C: Wohh rozanah ghonsley badalti hein**

Ibaarat mein saaf tor par kaha gaya hai ke ""iss marhalay mein colony aarzi ghonslay banaati hay jo harr roz tabdil hotay rahte hain"". Baaqi options is maloomat sey mutabiqat nahi rakhtay.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon kharjee isharon ki mojudgi key bawajood jaari rahey gee?,"The passage states: ""Hayatiyati clocks khud ko barqarar rakhnay waala irteashindah hay jo khaariji eshaaron kee adm maujudgi mein bhee aazadi sey chal rahay chakkar kee muddat ko jaari rakhay gaa.""

This directly translates to: ""Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue the duration of the freely running cycle even in the absence of external signals.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: Hayatiyaati ghadiyaan (Biological clocks)**
"
Konsi istelaah unn afraad ki wazahat karti hay jo makhsus phenotypic rawayyah key tanawwo ko zaahir karti hein?,"The correct answer is **D: Kaseer shakal**.

The passage clearly states that when individuals within a population exhibit multiple forms of a specific trait, they are considered polymorphic (kaseer shakal).
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon hayatiyaat ki durust istelaah hay jo eek khaas elaqah par qaabiz hoti hay?,"Sawaal Q mein puchha gaya hay ke eek khaas elaqay mein qaabiz hayatiyaat ke lie durust istelaah kya hay.

P qitaa ke mutaabiq, ""Aabadi sey muraad diye gaye geografiyayi elaqay key andar namiyati ajsaam kee makhsus anwaa kaa majmuah hota hay"".

Is lie, durust jawaab hay:

**B: Aabadi**
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon fitrat parr mabni seyahat ki sargarmi ki misaal nahein hogi?,"The correct answer is **C: Eek science museum ka daurah karnaa**.

Here's why:

* **Nature-based tourism** focuses on experiencing and learning about the natural environment.
* Options A, B, and D (hiking to a waterfall, photographing wildflowers, fly fishing) are all activities that directly involve interacting with nature.
* A science museum, while potentially educational about science, isn't necessarily focused on the natural environment in a direct, experiential way like the other options are. It's a more artificial and controlled environment.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon transport system ki buniyaad nahein hay?","Sahi jawaab hai **C: Ek mustahkam hayatiyaat**

Daleel:

Ebarat mein niji gaadiyon par mabni transport nizam ka zikar kiya gaya hai, aur iss nizam ka kaam ki manazil, niji carein, aur insaani irteqaa sey talluq bataya gaya hai. Lekin, ebarat mein transport system ki buniyad ke taur par ek mustahkam hayatiyaat ka zikar nahi hai, balkeh iss nizam key hayatiyatt par manfi asarat ka zikar hai. Isliye, C sahi jawaab hai.
"
Nucleus kaa chakkar laganey waley zarrat mein kiss qism ka charge hota hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Manfi charge**.

The passage states: ""electrons mein manfi electric charge hota hay"" which translates to ""electrons have a negative electric charge"". Since electrons are the particles orbiting the nucleus, the answer is negative charge.
"
Nucleus kinn zarraat sey morakkab hota hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Proton aur neutron**

The passage states: ""Nucleus do zarraat - neutron aur proton par mushtamil hota hay.""  (The nucleus consists of two particles - neutron and proton.)
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon thoda saa paanch binary number ki misaal hay?","Sawaal ke mutaabiq, binary number mein sirf 0 aur 1 istemaal hote hain.

*   A: 1010 - Sahi hai, kyunki isme sirf 0 aur 1 hain.
*   B: 12001 - Ghalat hai, kyunki isme 2 bhi hai.
*   C: 10010 - Sahi hai, kyunki isme sirf 0 aur 1 hain.
*   D: 110101 - Sahi hai, kyunki isme sirf 0 aur 1 hain.

Sawaal kehta hai ke ""paanch binary number ki misaal"". Iska matlab hai ke binary number mein 5 digits hone chahiye.

* A: 1010 - Is mein 4 digits hain.
* C: 10010 - Is mein 5 digits hain.
* D: 110101 - Is mein 6 digits hain.

Isliye, sahi jawaab hai:

**C: 10010**
"
Binary nambaraat ka kiss tarah ki cheezon ka hawalh diyaa jataa hay?,"Sawaal P mein saaf taur par kaha gaya hai ke binary adad ke aadaad ko ""binary digits yaa bits"" kaha jaata hai.

Isliye, sahih jawaab hai:

**A: Bits**
"
Darjah zail mein sey kiska talabah key blog likhney key buniyaadi fayedah key tor parr ebarat mein zikr kiya gaya hay?,"The best answer is **A: Qawaed aur tahreer ki salahiyat mein taraqqi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that students begin blogging with grammar and spelling errors, which are then corrected by readers. This motivates the student to improve their writing to avoid criticism. This directly links blogging to the improvement of grammar and writing skills.
*   The text mentions continuous learning and awareness of the world, but not as the **primary** benefit. Grammar and writing improvement is explicitly stated as a direct result of the blogging process in the first instance.
* The reduction in peer critique is merely a consequence of improved writing abilities, not a primary benefit.

Therefore, option A best describes the core benefit of blogging for students as described in the passage."
Blog likhney ka darjah zail konsey pahlu ka talabah key blog likhney ki maharaton ko behtar karney key liye bator moharrik hawalah diya jaata hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Tanqeed sey bachney parr zor (Emphasis on avoiding criticism)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that students, wanting to avoid criticism from blog readers, are motivated to improve their writing. While the other options are related to blogging, the passage directly connects avoiding criticism to the improvement of writing skills.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon talabah ki motazaad mowasilat ka fayedah nahein hay? ,"The correct answer is **B: Dinn key kisi bhi waqt hidayaton tak rubaru rasaayi**.

Here's why:

* **Asynchronous communication**, as described in passage P, means communication that doesn't happen in real-time.  It involves delays between sending and receiving messages.

Let's break down why the other options are benefits of asynchronous communication based on the provided passage:

*   **A: Bator wasilah internet ka istemaal (Use of the internet as a medium):** The passage mentions that the internet and world wide web allows learners to access information at any time. This enables asynchronous communication.
*   **C: Kaam key lachakdaar auqaat (Flexible working hours):** The passage explicitly states that flexible times with potential for work mean that time constraints will be few.
*   **D: Raftaar control (Pace control):** The passage mentions that asynchronous communication helps students work at their own pace and control the speed of learning material.

Option B is the only one that describes synchronous (real-time) access to instructions (""rubaru"" implies face-to-face or real-time interaction). Asynchronous communication is not face-to-face, but involves delay."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, motazaad mowasilat ka darjah zail konsa pahlu talabah key liye lachakdaar nahein hay?","The correct answer is **A: Sikhney ki raftaar**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that asynchronous communication allows students to *control the pace of the instructional material* (""talbaa ko apni raftaar sey kam karnay aur tadrisi malumat kee raftaar par qaabu paaney kee sahulat deta hay""). This means they *do* have flexibility in their learning pace.

*   The passage mentions ""lacheelay auqate kaar kardagi key imkaan"" (flexible working hours) , indicating flexibility in *work times* (B).

*   The text highlights that learners can access information at any time using the Internet and the World Wide Web, this mean they have full access to *Tadrisee mawaad* anytime (C).

*   *Internet ka istemaal* is mentioned as a means to access information at any time, meaning there is flexibility in that.

Therefore, learning pace being inflexible contradicts the passage's core argument."
Kisko ebarat mein iss tor parr zikr nahein kiya gaya hay jaisa kehh koyi aisi cheez jisey koyi shakhs qoroone wustaa key mahallaat sey wabastah kar sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Jhooti ladayiaan (False battles)**.

Here's why:

*   **Khandaraat key gadhey (Ruined pits):** The passage mentions ""Zameen doz qilah key garhay say uthnay waale khauf"" (fear rising from the pits of underground castles), indicating a connection to ruined pits.
*   **Bahaduri (Bravery):** The passage talks about ""ghoday par jangi muqabilay"" (warrior confrontations on horseback), which inherently implies bravery.
*   **Shorveer (Knight):** The passage mentions ""aarturiyayi ahed key ghodsawari kee tasveeron"" (images of Arthurian-era horsemanship), which refers to knights.
*   **Jhooti Ladayiaan (False battles):** The passage mentions ""taweel arse sey takhayyul"" (long-term imagination), ""ghoday par jangi muqabilay"" (warrior confrontations on horseback), ""ziyafat"" (feasts), and ""aarturiyayi ahed key ghodsawari kee tasveeron"" (images of Arthurian-era horsemanship). While these elements are all associated with medieval castles, the passage never explicitly mentions or implies that there were ""false battles"" or battles that were staged or fraudulent."
Darjah zail mein kiska ebarat mein iss tor parr zikr nahein hay kehh mahal key baqiyaat mein kisi boo yaa aawaz ko dikhaya jaa skata hay?,"Correct Answer: C: Ziyaafatein (Ziyaafat)

Explanation: The paragraph mentions:

*   **Khauf (Fear)**: ""Zameen doz qilah key garhay say uthnay waale khauf ko soonghne..."" (Smelling the fear rising from the depths of the underground fort...)
*   **Khurein (Hooves)**: ""taqriban khuron par khurdariyon kaa hangama sunanay key liye..."" (To almost hear the rumble of hooves...)
*   **Ladayiaan (Battles)**: ""...hazaar salah khandraat key darmiyan khaday taweel muddati ladaiyon kee aawazon aur boo ko mahsus karnaa aasaan hay."" (...it is easy to feel the sounds and smells of long-term battles standing between the thousand-year-old trenches.)

Ziyafatein (Feasts) are mentioned as something that influenced imagery (""ziyafat aur aarturiyayi ahed key ghodsawari kee tasveeron ko mutissir kiya hay"" - feasting influenced images of Arthurian-era horsemanship), but it's not stated that one could detect the smell or sound of feasts amongst the castle ruins."
Darjah zail mein sey kon Kirby Muxloe mahal ki durust wazahat nahein hay?,"Correct answer: **D: Isey taweel aur barqaraar hamlon sey bachney key liye tameer kiya gaya thaa**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Kirby Muxloe Castle *wasn't* built to withstand prolonged or severe attacks. It mentions the castle had large, transparent windows and weak walls, making it unsuitable for such defense. The passage also notes the peaceful state of the country at the time of construction, meaning heavy fortifications weren't necessary.

The other options are consistent with the passage:

*   **A: Mahal ki moti deewaron ki Lord Hastings ney darkhawast ki thee**- The passage directly mentions ""kamzor dewarein"" meaning the castle was built with thin walls so this statement is inaccurate.
*   **B: Tameer key waqt isko mulk ki pur aman fitrat ki wajah sey kam sey kam qilaa bandi ki zarurat thee** - This aligns with the passage mentioning the country being peaceful and only needing protection from small groups of roaming bandits.
*   **C: Mahal ki tameer waqt ki muddat key liye aam nahein hay** - It may be true to the fact that this was a castle being built during the time of peace, rather than for war."
Tameer ki darjah zail konsi khosusiyat ko ebarat mein wazah kardah waqt ki muddat key doraan Kirby Muxloe mahal key liye aam samjhaa jaye gaa?,"Ebarat ke mutabiq, Kirby Muxloe mahal mein badi badi shaffaf khidkiyan our kamzor dewarein thi. Is se pata chalta hai ke ye kam qila bandi wala tha.

Isliye sahih jawab hai:

**C: Kuch mahallaat ki banisbat kam qilaa bandi**
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon aayendah season ki tayyaari kar rahey runner key sabsey ziyadah fayedah mand hogi?","Sawaal mein diye gaye passage ke mutaabiq, sardi ke mausam mein tezqadmi, jo agar sum ke oopri hisse ke liye jamnazim ki kam ke saath milayi jaye, ye tezqadmi ke season ke liye behtareen tayyari hai. Oopari jism ki warzish karney key liye gym ka istemaal karna bhi passage mein zikr kiya gaya hai.

Is liye, durust jawab hay:

**D: oopari jism ki warzish karney key liye gym ka istemaal karnaa**
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon pahley darjah key aadha meel key runner key liye bahut ziyadah aham nahein hay?","The correct answer is **C: Do minat key taht clock karnaa** (Clocking under two minutes).

Here's why:

*   **P states:** While a top half-miler *needs* speed, endurance is *absolutely* essential.
*   **Options A, B, and D** are either directly mentioned or implied as important for developing endurance and managing the challenges of a half-mile race (cross-country in winter, enduring speed training, building endurance on speed).
*   **Option C (Clocking under two minutes)**: While P mentions breaking the two-minute barrier, the passage emphasizes that endurance and resilience are *more* crucial than pure speed, especially considering the complexities of the race.

Therefore, while speed is important, the passage suggests that focusing *solely* on clocking under two minutes is not the most critical aspect for a half-mile runner. Endurance and resilience are prioritized."
"Eek khelaadi key liye, darjah zail mein sey kisko akeley gezayi mashqon key zariyah haasil nahein kiya jaa sakta?","Sawaal mein P bayaan kehta hai ki sirf munasib ghezayi mashqon se aala karkardagiyan shuroo nahi ki jaa saktein. Is ka matlab hai ki aala karkardagi (top performance) sirf ghezayi mashqon se haasil nahi ho sakti. Bayaan mein yeh bhi kaha gaya hai ki ghezayi mashqon se kul sehatmandi aur behtari par asar hota hai, karkardagi behtar hoti hai, aur sport se ziyadah lutf andoz hua ja sakta hai.

Sawaal Q poochta hai ki kya cheez akeley gezayi mashqon se haasil nahi ki jaa sakti.

Option A: Behtar karkardagi (Improved performance) - Bayaan mein hai ki ghezayi mashqon se karkardagi behtar hoti hai.

Option B: Ezafah kardah tafreeh (Increased enjoyment) - Bayaan mein hai ki athlete sport se ziyadah lutf andoz ho saktay hain.

Option C: Sarkardah karkardagi (Top performance) - Bayaan mein saaf taur par kaha gaya hai ki sirf ghezayi mashqon se aala karkardagiyan shuroo nahi ki jaa saktein.

Option D: Aam bhalayi (General well-being) - Bayaan mein hai ki ghezayi mashqon se kul sehatmandi aur behtari par asar hota hai.

Isliye, sahi jawab **C: Sarkardah karkardagi** hai.
"
"Ebarat kei buniyaad parr, darjah zail mein sey kisko nawjawaan kheladiyon key apney khel mein mazeed tafreeh haasil karney key eek tariqah key tor parr tajweez nahein kiya gaya hay?","Sahi jawab hai **B: Sarkardah satah parr mosalsal karkardagi karnaa**.

Wajah:

P paragraph mein, yeh bataaya gaya hai kay durust ghizaayi mashqe, badan ko kaargar tareeqay se paani pahonchaana aur sehatmandanah taaqat ka tawazun barqaraar rakhna, athlete ki karkardagi ko behtar banaate hain aur unhen apne sport se ziyadah lutf andoz hone mein madad karte hain.

Q paragraph, yeh pooch raha hai ke unmein se kis cheez ko tafreeh haasil karne ke tareeqe ke tor parr tajweez nahein kiya gaya hai.

Options A, C aur D P paragraph mein direct mention kiya gaya hai.

Option B (Sarkardah satah parr mosalsal karkardagi karnaa) ka direct zikr P mein nahein hai, balkay yeh behtar karkardagi ka eek natija ho sakta hai jo mazkoora baala tareeqon ke zariye haasil kiya jaata hai. Isiliye, ise tafreeh haasil karne ke eek tariqay ke tor parr direct tajweez nahein kiya gaya hai.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, eek darmiyani faslah ka runner sazo saaman ka ek mazeed qimati tukda keon kharid sakta hay?","The correct answer is **A: Yehh unki zati tarjeeh hay (It is their personal preference).**

The passage states that runners might prefer certain products even though they don't provide any real benefits. This indicates that the purchase is driven by personal preference rather than proven benefits or a significant impact on performance.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darmiyani faslah waley runner ko kiss cheez ki zarurat hay?","The correct answer is **C: Bahut kam saazo saaman** (Very little equipment).

The passage states that middle-distance running is a relatively inexpensive sport and that while some equipment is required, many products marketed to runners don't actually improve performance. This implies that the essential equipment needed is minimal.
"
Kisney jauhari miqnaatisi goonj ki daryaaft ki thee? ,"Sahi jawab hai: **C: Bloch aur Purcell**

Explanation: Text saaf tor par batata hai ke Felix Bloch aur Edward Purcell ne 1930 mein jauhari miqnaatisi goonj (NMR) daryaaft ki thee.
"
Tibbee tasweer ki goonj key liye kiss saal mein pahley haqqe tahaffuz ki manzoori dee gayee thee? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

The passage states: ""Chaar saal baad patent manzoor kiya gayaa thaa, jo MRI key maidan mein duniya kaa sub say pehla jaari kardah patent thaa"" after mentioning that Dr. Damadian discovered the basis for MRI in 1970. This implies the patent was approved in 1974.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, insaanon key paas deegar logon key jismaani aamaal mein modakhilat karney key liye kiss cheez ki mazboot samajh honi chahiye?","The correct answer is **B: Iraadah (Intent)**.

The passage explicitly states that understanding the intentions of others is crucial (""Inn salahiyaton mein doosray kee niyat ko samajhna ahem hay""). The example given highlights how interpreting someone's actions (breaking a car window) depends on understanding their intent (stealing vs. unlocking their own car). The ability to understand intent helps resolve the ambiguities of physical actions.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, iraadah ko samajhney sey insaanon ko kiya karney mein madad milti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Jismaani aamaal key peechey gair yaqiniyat ko khatam karnaa** (Eliminating uncertainty behind physical actions).

The passage states that understanding intentions helps resolve potential ambiguities in physical actions. The example of the person breaking into the car illustrates this: without understanding the intention, you might assume theft, but understanding the intention (they lost their keys) removes the ambiguity.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon AI key asal maqsad ka durust khulasah nahein hay?","Is ebarat ke mutabiq AI ke asal maqsad ka durust khulasah jo nahin hai woh hai:

**C: Miqaat bandi** (Scheduling)

Ebarat mein planning aur scheduling dono ka zikr hai lekin miqaat bandi ko asal maqsad ke tor per wazeh nahin kiya gaya hai. Baqi tamam option (manbsubah bandi, aawaz ki shanakht aur kaam ki khud kaari) ebarat mein AI ke maqasid ke tor per zikr kiye gaye hain.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zai mein sey kiskey saath AI aksar wabastah rahtaa hay?","The passage mentions that AI is involved in ""control, planing our sheedoling"" which translates to ""control, planning and scheduling."" Option B, ""Manbsubah bandi aur Miqaat bandi,"" translates to ""Planning and Scheduling.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: Manbsubah bandi aur Miqaat bandi**
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon motagayyar ki soch key pattern waley kisi shakhs ki taaqat hoti hay?","Sahi jawaab **D: Pattern ko yaad rakhnaa** hai.

Ebarat mein saaf taur par zikr kiya gaya hai ke is qism ke khayalaat ke hamil afraad manteqana soch rakhte hain aur **patterns ko yaad rakhnay** ki salahiyat rakhte hain. Baaki options ebarat mein di gayi tafseelat se mutabiqat nahi rakhte.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kisko motagayyar soch waley tarze khiyaal ki tawajjoh ka markaz nahi samjha jaata hay?","Sawal ke mutabiq, Taqarrubi Fikr (Convergent Thinking) mein nimnlikhit cheezain shaamil hain:

*   **Haqaayeq ki shanakhat karnaa** (Identifying Facts)
*   **Malumaat ekatthah karnaa** (Gathering Information)
*   **Yehh samajhna kehh sirf eek durust jawaab hay** (Understanding that there's only one correct answer)

Lekin ""Kisi shakhs ka waqt lenaa"" (Taking one's time) ya raftaar, Taqarrubi Fikr ka markaz nahi hay. Taqarrubi Fikr ka markaz raftaar nahi hay, balke durustagi hai.

Therefore, the correct answer is: **B: Kisi shakhs ka waqt lenaa**

*   **B: Peshaani ko khurachnaa:** Yeh ek jismaani harkat hai jo aksar preshani, soch-vichar, ya bechaini zahir karti hai, lekin zaruri nahi ke yeh chehre ke jazbaat ka izhaar ho.

*   **C: Tezi sey palak jhapkanaa:** Yeh chehre ka ek chota sa izhaar hai jo bechaini, jhuth, ya ghabrahat zahir kar sakta hai. Yeh micro izhaar ho sakta hai.

*   **D: Anguthaa dikhanaa:** Yeh aik bada ishara hai jo pasand ya tasdeeq zahir karta hai, lekin yeh chehre ka izhaar nahi hai.

Is liye, sahih jawab hai:

**D: Anguthaa dikhanaa**"
Micro izhaar ki tashreeh key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah durust nahein hay?,"Sawal ke mutabiq, darjazail bayanion mein se kaunsa bayan micro izhar ki tashreeh ke barey mein durust nahi hai:

*   **D:** Iss sey kholus ka andazah laganey mein madad mil sakti hay - **Yeh durust hai**, kyunkey paragraph mein Oliver Sax ke research ka hawala diya gaya hai jis mein bataya gaya hai ke dimaghi nuqs wale log bhi kholus ka andaza laga sakte hain.

Lehaza, diye gaye tamam bayanat durust hain aur paragraph mein di gayi maloomat ke mutabiq hain. Sawal mein galti ho sakti hai ya phir koi aur maqsad chhupa hua ho sakta hai. Agar sawal ko iss tarah samjha jaye ke ""in mein se kaunsa daawa paragraph mein bilkul saaf taur par nahin kiya gaya?"" To phir Jawab C behtar ho sakta hay kyunke text direct taur par baat aur chehre ki tashrih ki baat nahin karta, balkay micro expression ki baat karta hay. Lekin phir bhi, sabhi option kisi na kisi tareeqay se paragraph se mutaliq hain.

Ranaisans key natijah key tor parr darjah zail mein sey kon ziyadah aham bann gaya thaa? ,"The correct answer is **C: Matan ki yaddasht**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""abb infiradi yaad aawari key andar bilkul dabao nahein rehta thaa, lekin matan kee yaad aawari kee ahliyat ziyadah tawajjoh kaa markaz bunn gayaa."" This translates to: ""Now there was no pressure at all within individual memory, but the ability of textual memory became the focus of more attention."" This directly supports the answer that textual memory became more important.
"
"Ranaisans key natijah key tor parr, kam takeed darjah zail mein sey kiss parr ki gayi thee?","The correct answer is **A: Fard ki yaddasht**.

The passage states: ""abb infiradi yaad aawari key andar bilkul dabao nahein rehta thaa, lekin matan kee yaad aawari kee ahliyat ziyadah tawajjoh kaa markaz bunn gayaa."" This translates to ""Now there was absolutely no pressure within individual recall, but the ability to recall text became the center of attention.""

This directly indicates that individual memory received less emphasis as a result of the Renaissance.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon talluqaat jaari rakhney key liye internet istemaal karney key eek moharrik ki akkasi nahein kartaa hay?,"P passage internet ke istemaal ke hawale se kuch motivation (targhib) aur hauslah afzaa pahluwon ka zikr kar raha hai, jaise:

*   **Seekhna:** Ilm hasil karna ya kuch naya seekhna.
*   **Muashirati Sulook:** Social interaction aur rabtay barqarar rakhna.
*   **Shakhsi Shomuliyat:** Personally involved hona, ya shayad apne passion/interests ko follow karna.
*   **Mustaqil Talluqaat:** Existing relationships ko maintain karna.

Ab options dekhte hain:

*   **A: Karobaar ki networking:** Networking karna ""mustaqil talluqaat"" se directly relate nahi karta, aur na hi passage mein directly zikr hai. Ye ek alag maqsad ho sakta hai.
*   **B: Kandaan key saath rabtah mein rahnaa:** Ye bilkul ""mustaqil talluqaat"" se related hai.
*   **C: Safar ki tahqiq karnaa:** Safar ki tehqiq karna, ""seekhna"" category mein aa sakta hai, agarcheh ye directly talluqat jaari rakhnay se related nahin hai.
*   **D: Naye logon sey mulaqaat karnaa:** Ye ""muashirati sulook"" aur ""shakhsi shomuliyat"" dono mein aa sakta hai, qk naye rishte banatay hain.

Sabse kam related option **C: Safar ki tahqiq karnaa** hai. Passage ka asal maqsad existing rishton ko jaari rakhnay par focus karna hai, aur safar ki tehqiq directly isse related nahin hai.

So, the answer is **C**.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon zaati mashguliyat key liye internet istemaal karney key eek moharrik ki akkasi nahein kartaa hay?,"P: ""Internet, bade पैमाने और बाहमी मवासिलात दोनों के अनासिर को जोड़ता है। इंटरनेट की इम्तियाज़ी खुसूसियत ये हैं कि वो इस्तेमाल और तसल्ली बख्श तरीक़ाकार के इस्तेमाल के मामले में इज़ाफ़ी ज़ाविये की सम्त ले जाता है। मिसाल के तौर पर, """"सीखने"""" और ''मुआशिरती सुलूक"""" को इंटरनेट इस्तेमाल के लिए बतौरे अहम तरगीब गर्दाना जाता है (James, 1995)। जब अगमी और मीक कार्ड (1998) ने वेब साइट पर मुखातबीन के रद्दे अमल की तहक़ीक़ की, तो उन्होंने """"शख़्सी शमूलियत"""" और """"मुस्तक़िल तालुकात"""" को भी नए हौसला अफ़ज़ा पहलुओं के तौर पर पहचाना।""

Q: दर्जे़ ज़ैल में से कौन ज़ाती मशगूलियत के लिए इंटरनेट इस्तेमाल करने के एक मुहर्रिक की अक्कासी नहीं करता है?
A: किसी नुक्ता को देखना
B: किसी ऑनलाइन बहस के बोर्ड पर पोस्ट करना
C: सेहत की देखभाल की मसनूआत की तहक़ीक़ करना
D: मालियात का बंदोबस्त करना

The question asks which option doesn't reflect a motive for using the internet for personal engagement.

*   **A: Kisi nukhah ko dekhnaa (किसी नुक्ता को देखना) - Viewing a point:** This doesn't necessarily imply personal engagement. It could be passive consumption of information.

*   **B: Kisi online bahas key board parr post karnaa (किसी ऑनलाइन बहस के बोर्ड पर पोस्ट करना) - Posting on an online discussion board:** This involves active participation and engagement with others.

*   **C: Sehat ki dekh bhaal ki masnuaat ki tahqiq karnaa (सेहत की देखभाल की मसनूआत की तहक़ीक़ करना) - Researching healthcare products:** This could involve personal health concerns and therefore personal engagement.

*   **D: Maliyaat ka bando bast karnaa (मालियात का बंदोबस्त करना) - Managing finances:** This is a personal matter involving engagement.

Based on the above analysis, viewing a point (A) is the option that least reflects a motive for using the internet for personal engagement.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Kisi nukhah ko dekhnaa**.

Maghribi Europe ney kabb asaraat parr bahut ziyaadah bharosa krnaa band kar diyaa aur apney andaaz sey taraqqi karnaa shuru kiyaa?,"Sawaal mein poocha gaya hay keh Maghribi europe ney kabb asraat parr bahut ziyaadah bharosa krnaa band kar diyaa aur apney andaaz sey taraqqi karnaa shuru kiyaa. Paragraph mein kaha gaya hay, “Qoroone wusta key aakhir mein maghrabi europe nay apnay tarz ko taraqqi dena shuroo kiya.”

Kapdon ko baandhney key liye button ka istemaal karnaa kis cheez ka natijah thaa? ,"Sahi jawab hai **C: Saleebi jangein**

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kisko mahauliyaati masail ka eek qaabile amal taweel muddati hal samjha jaata hay?","Correct answer: **C: Masail ki wajah ki shanaakht karnaa**

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that symbolic solutions are not enough and that to truly address environmental issues, we need to ""talaash karkay unhein band kar dena chahiye"" (find and shut them down). This directly corresponds to identifying the root causes of the problems. Options A, B, and D are mentioned in the passage as actions that help mitigate the environmental crisis but the key element to resolve the root cause is to identify the root causes and shut them down. Therefore, C is the most reasonable and sustainable long-term solution.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail kon sey hal ko mahauliyaati masail key alamati elaaj key tor parr samjha jaye gaa?","The passage states that living a more environmentally friendly life, participating in the environmental movement, and being an active member to reduce future suffering *can* be like symbolic treatment in many situations. Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Mahaul dostanah tariqah sey zindagi guzarnaa** (Living an environmentally friendly life).

The passage explicitly identifies this as *potentially* being a symbolic treatment. The other options are not directly identified as such in the passage.

Europe ki pahli ladayi kiss mulk mein hui thee jiskey markazi masalah key baarey mein kaha jaata hay kehh wohh mazhabi seyaaqo sabaaq ka haamil honey key bajaye hukumat key tawazun sey motalliq thaa?,"Based on the text provided, the Spanish Succession War was the first war where the balance of power was the central issue, rather than religion. Spain is given as the location of this war, therefore the correct answer is:

**D: Spain**
"
Kiss jang ki baaz auqaat aakhiri ‘mazhabi ladayi’ key tor parr wazahat ki jaati hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Tees saalah jang**.

The passage explicitly states that the Thirty Years' War was ""the last war that could be called a religious war"".

Catholic church key konsey darjah zail pahlu ki chaan been nahein ki jaa rahi thee?,"Sawal P mein Catholic Church ki jaanch ke daire mein aane ki wajah bayan ki gayi hai. Is mein yeh zikr hai ke:

*   Church bohat maaldaar aur taqatwar ban chuka tha.
*   Log sawaal kar rahe thay ke kya Church dolat ko moseebat aur gurbat mein takhfif ke liye istemaal karne ke usool par poora utar raha tha, kyunke church ki dolat ka bada hissa sirf isi maqsad ke liye jama tha.
*   Church ki taaqat Rome mein markooz thi aur is markaziyat par bhi logon ko shak tha.

Sawal Q mein pucha gaya hai ke church ke konsey pahlu ki chaan been NAHI ki jaa rahi thi.

Options ko dekhte hain:

*   A: Aya Church key andar ki daulat ki takhsees munaasib thee - Ye chaan been ki jaa rahi thee, kyunke paragraph mein zikr hai ke log sawal kar rahe thay ke kya church dolat ko gurbat kam karne mein istemal kar raha hai ya nahi.

*   B: Aya mazhab key buniyadi osulon ki islaah honi chahiye - Paragraph mein mazhab ke buniyadi usoolon ki islaah ka koi zikr nahi hai. Log dolat ke istemal aur taqat ki markaziyat par sawal kar rahe thay, usoolon par nahi.

*   C: Church key andar ki taaqat ki markaziyat - Ye bhi chaan been ki jaa rahi thee, kyunke paragraph mein Rome mein taaqat ki markaziyat ka zikr hai aur is par logon ko shak tha.

*   D: Aya mazhab key buniyadi osul purey kiye jaa rahey hein - Ye bhi chaan been ka hissa tha, kyunke dolat ko gurbat kam karne mein istemaal karne ka usool mazhab ka buniyadi usool hai.

Is liye, sahi jawab **B: Aya mazhab key buniyadi osulon ki islaah honi chahiye** hai.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Versailles mein kiskaa qatal hua thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Eek mohafiz**.

The passage states that a member of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko bheed ney badshah aur malekah parr nafiz nahein kiy thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Mohafiz key sarr qalam karney ko dekhnaa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that a member of the mob waved the head of a royal guard *in front of* the terrified queen. It doesn't explicitly say the king and queen were forced to watch it.

The other options were all forced upon them by the crowd:

*   **A: apney carriage key dareechon ko kholnaa:** The passage says the crowd forced them to open the carriage windows.
*   **B: Versailles sey achaanak ka khoruj:** They were forced to leave Versailles by the mob.
*   **D: Paris ka wapasi safar:** They were forced to return to Paris."
Darjah zail mein sey kon bartaniyah key gair rewayati bahri jang ka natijah nahein hay?,"Sahi jawab hai **C: Alami qanoon mein tabdiliyaan ki gayi theen**

**Wajah:**

*   **A: Momaasil jangi harbon ko tainaat karney ki jarmani ki khawahish:** Paragraph mein wazeh tor parr kaha gaya hai keh bartaniah key tareeqey parr raddeamal kamzor hone ki wajah say germani nay ghair mehdood aabdozon ki jang shuroo karney ki tawaqqo ki. Is liye yeh natijah hai.
*   **B: Gair mashgool jahaz ko noqsaan key andaz mein rakhaa gaya thaa:** Paragraph mein wazeh hai keh bartaniah ki barudi surangein bichhane ki wajah say ghair jaanibdar jahazon ko khatra hua, yaani noqsaan ka andesha tha. Is liye yeh bhi natijah hai.
*   **D: Aham farahmiyaan naqabiley rasaayi theen:** Paragraph mein wazeh hai keh bartaniah ki bahri gherabandi say haiwi askari aur civilian rasad munqata ho gayi thi, yani ahem farahmiyan naqabiley rasayi theen. Is liye yeh bhi natijah hai.

*   **C: Alami qanoon mein tabdiliyaan ki gayi theen:** Paragraph mein bartaniah ki janib say bain alaqwami qanoon ki khelaaf warzi ka zikar to hai, lekin is baat ka koi zikar nahin keh is wajah say alami qanoon mein tabdiliyaan ki gayin. Yeh natijah nahin balkeh bartaniah key amal par aik tanqeed hai."
Konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr bartaniyah key jarmani key khilaaf bahri gherabandi ki wazahat nahein karta hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Issney yaqeen thaa dilaya thaa kehh fitri jahazon ko khatrey mein nahein dalaa jaye gaa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Britain laid mines in international waters, endangering neutral ships. Therefore, option D is false.
*   The passage confirms A: The blockade violated international law.
*   The passage confirms B: Germany expected the U-boat campaign to provoke the same limited response as the blockade.
*   The passage confirms C: The blockade was effective in cutting off military and civilian supplies."
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, kinkey liye motaddid amraaz ki tashkhisaat sabsey ziyadah mumkin hogi?","Sahi jawab hai **A: Eek 32 salah khatun**.

Bayan mein wazeh taur par kaha gaya hai ke ""Tehqeeq say patah challa hay keh khwateen mein MS mardon say do gunaa ziyadah honey kaa imkaan hota hay.""  Is liye khawateen mardon ke muqable mein MS se tashkhees hone ka ziyada imkaan hai. Di gai options mein, 32 saala khatun uss age group mein aati hai jis mein MS aksar tashkhees hoti hai (naujawanon aur adhed balghan)."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, baqaedah sargargi mein shirkat karney walon ko kiss cheez keliye mazeed himaayat ki zarurat thee?","The correct answer is **A: Dard ka manfi tasavvur (Dard key manfi tasavvur)**

The passage states: ""Baqayedgi say sargarmiyon mein hissah lenay waalon ko mamool kee jismani naql wo harkat say honey waale daaimi dard aur takleef key ehsaas key darmiyan farq ko eyaan karnay waale dard key manfi tasavvur key lehaaz say ziyadah madad kee zaroorat hoti hay.""

This directly translates to: ""People who regularly participate in activities needed more support in terms of negative perceptions of pain, which clarify the difference between chronic pain and the feeling of discomfort from routine physical movement.""

Therefore, those participating in regular activities needed more support regarding negative perceptions of pain.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, baad bananey ka kaam aam tor sey kaisey anjaam diya jaata hay?","The correct answer is **D: Eek duel shakal mein** (In a duel form).

The passage explicitly states: ""Yeah sport awwaleen taur say eek duel kee shakal mein khela jaataa hay..."" which means ""This sport is primarily played in a duel form..."".
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey ko internet ki zahar khurani ka sabsey mazboot nishandahi karney wala hoga?","Sahi jawab hai: **D: Eek nuskhah ki goli ka bottle**

Iski wajah yeh hai ke paragraph mein wazeh taur per kaha gaya hai: ""Androni zaharkhuri kee behtareen nishandahi adviyaat yaa zahrile ghareloo kimiyayi ajzaa kee khule bottle kee maujudgi hosakti hay."" (Internal poisoning can best be indicated by the presence of open bottles of medicine or toxic household chemicals.)

Baaki options, matli, ulti, sakht akdan aur pet dard, zaharkhurani ki alamaat ho sakte hain, lekin woh ""sabsey mazboot nishandahi"" nahi hain jaisa ki paragraph mein zikr kiya gaya hai.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kisi motassirah ki tashkhees kartey waqt pahla munasib qadam kiya hota hay?","The passage clearly states: ""Haadsah key shikaar fard kee jaanch say pehle apni hifazat key liye jaye haadsah kaa jaizah len."" This translates to: ""Before checking on the victim of an accident, go and assess the accident scene for your own safety.""

Therefore, the first appropriate step when assessing a victim, according to the passage, is to **assess the scene**.

The correct answer is: **A: Manzar ka mushahidah karnaa** (Observe the scene).
"
Konsa darjah zail bayaniyah durust tor parr motassirah ki jaanch karney key amal ki akkaasi karta hay?,"Sawaal mein diye gaye paragraph ke mutabiq, durust jawab **B: Mutassirah key saamney manzar ka andazah lagayein** hai.

Paragraph mein kaha gaya hai ke ""Haadsah key shikaar fard kee jaanch say pehle... haadsah kaa jaizah len."" Iska matlab hai ke mutassirah ki jaanch shuru karne se pehle haadse ke manzar (scene) ko dekhna aur samajhna zaroori hai. Yeh khud ki hifazat aur mutassirah ko behtar madad faraham karne ke liye ahem hai.

Baaqi options paragraph ke mutabik durust nahi hain:

*   **A: Apney zakhmon ki taab laaney ki fikar na karein:** Paragraph khud ki hifazat ko pehli ahmiyat deta hai.
*   **C: Motassirah ki position ka mushahedah karein:** Position ka mushahida karna zaroori hai lekin yeh pehla qadam nahi hai. Pehle manzar ka jaiza lena zaroori hai.
*   **D: Kisi bhi surkh jhnadon ka notice leney ki koshish karein:** ""Surkh jhandon"" ka concept is passage mein nahi diya gaya hai.
"
Farancisi inqilaab sey paida honey wali konsi tabdiliyon ka kaam gaar tabqah key shahriyon parr ahem asar thaa?,"The best answer is **B: Tabqah sey qabiliyat ki taraf muntaqili (Shift from class to merit)**. Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states:** ""Wohee cheez fauj parr lagoo hoti hay keunkeh fauj kee ranking cliss parr mabni honey key bajaye abb calber parr mabni hoti hay"" (The same thing applies to the military because military rankings are now based on caliber instead of class). This directly demonstrates the shift from class-based systems to merit-based systems, which would significantly impact the working class by allowing them to rise based on their abilities rather than their social standing. The passage also states: ""Inqilaab key baad hirfatein tamaam mard darkhwast dehandgan key liye khol di gayee theen, jis say intehayi pur ummeed aur kamiyab afraad ko kamiyabi haasil karnay kaa moqaa milaa"" (After the revolution, professions were opened to all male applicants, giving extremely promising and successful individuals the opportunity to succeed).

Here's why the other options are not as direct or central to the working class's experience:

*   **A: Mulk key liye himaayat mein ezaafah ho gaya (Increased support for the country):** While patriotism may have increased, the direct impact on the *economic* or *social mobility* of the working class is less clear.
*   **C: Jamhuri nazariyah ko ikhtiyaar karnaa (Adopting democratic ideology):** This is a broader consequence. While important, the shift from class to merit (Option B) is a more tangible and directly relevant change for the working class citizens.
*   **D: Eek naya paimaehs karney ka system (A new measuring system):** The metric system is mentioned, but it's not presented as a *key* impact on the working class in the passage.

Therefore, the answer is **B**."
"Farancisi inqilaab key baad, foj aur deegar peshon mein kamiyaabi ka kiss cheez parr mabni honey ka kam imkaan thaa?","The correct answer is **B: Tabqah (Class)**.

The passage states that after the French Revolution, army rankings (and by extension, success in other professions) were based on **caliber (ability)** rather than **class**. Therefore, class became *less* likely to be the basis for success.
"
Konsi awaami khidmat key baarey mein kaha jaata hay kehh wohh taraqqi yaaftah mamalik mein bahut ziyadah bechaini ki wajah thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Awami transport**.

The passage states that ""almost everyone complains about the transportation system"" and mentions water quality and bridge collapses as occasional complaints *in developed countries*. This implies that public transportation is a more widespread and frequent source of complaint. Therefore, it's the public service most likely to cause a lot of anxiety.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, awami transportation system key baarey mein kiya kaha jaa sakta hay?","The correct answer is **C: Wohh unko istemaal karney walon ki bahut si shikayaton ki wajah hein** (They are the cause of many complaints from those who use them).

The passage clearly states that almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, drivers ki gair motawaqqayiat ki wajah sey darjah zail mein sey kiska paimaanah karnaa mushkil ho sakta hay?","Sahi jawaab hai: **D: Traffic ki rawani**

Wajaahat:

Ebarat mein saaf taur par bataya gaya hai ke ""Badqismati say traffic kee rawani kaa mutalah bahut mushkil hay keunkeh driver key rawayyah kee peshin goyee sau fisadi yaqeeni ke saath nahein kee jasakti hay.""

Iska matlab yeh hai ke traffic ki rawani ko naapna mushkil hai kyunke driver ke rawaiye ka andaza poori yaqeeni ke saath nahi lagaya ja sakta. Digar options itne seedhe taur par ebarat mein nahi bataye gaye hain.
"
Riyaazi tor parr kisi traffic ki rwani ki nomaindagi kartey waqt darjah zail mein sey kiska istemaal kiya jata hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Traffic ki kasafat**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Traffic kee rawani ko behatar dhang say pesh karnay keliye teen asl kirdaar key darmiyan rishtay qayem kiye gaye hain:(1) rawani, (2) kasafat, (3) aur..."" This indicates that traffic density (kasafat) is one of the core elements used to mathematically model traffic flow. The other options are related to traffic but not directly used in mathematical modeling according to the passage.
"
Hershey aur Chase ney apney DNA ki pewand kaaree karnay key liye kiya istemaal kiya thaa? ,"The correct answer is **D: Viruses**.

The passage states: ""Harshi aur ches nay eek bacteria mein apnay dna kee pewand kaaree karnay key liye, jaraseem khoron, yaa **viruses** kaa istemaal kiya."" This directly translates to ""Hershey and Chase used **viruses** to graft their DNA into a bacterium.""
"
Kisi taghayyur ki bachon tak muntaqil honey ki salahiyat kiss cheez parr munhasir hay?,"Correct answer is **A: Agar khaliye jarsimi line hon**

The passage explicitly states: ""Sirf jarasimi line key khaliyon mein honey waale taghayyuraat ko bachon tak muntaqil kiya jasakta hay"" (Only mutations occurring in germline cells can be passed on to children).
"
"Ebarat mein dee gayi malumaat ki buniyaad parr, taghayyuraat key motaddid asaraat kis parr munhasir nahein hotey hein?","Correct Answer is **D: Motassirah taghayyur ki qism**

The passage clearly says that the effects of mutation depend on:

*   **A: Jitna jinyati maaddah motassir hua hay (The importance of the affected genetic material)** The passage mentions the importance of the affected genetic material.
*   **B: Agar motassirah khaliye jarasimi line hon (Whether the affected cells are germline)** The passage explicitly states that only mutations in germline cells are passed to offspring.
*   **C: Motassirah jinyati maaddah ki ahmiyat (Whether affected cell germline or not)** The passage talks about the significance of affected cell being germline or not.

However, the passage does not provide any information on how the ""qism"" or *type* of mutation affects its effect, it only describes which *cells* if mutated can cause a heritable or non-heritable effect.
"
Darjah zail mien sey kon iss baat ki wajah nahein hay kehh qadeem saqafaton mein bakriyaan rakhi jaati theen?,"Sahi jawab hai **C: Unhoney ney suhbat pesh ki.**

Diye gaye passage mein bakriyon ko rakhne ki wajohat mein doodh, ball (wool), gosht aur khaal tak aasaan rasayi ka zikr hai. Zameen mein charane mein madad karna bhi ek wajeh ho sakti hai, lekin passage mein iska zikr nahi hai. Suhbat (companionship) ka koi zikr nahi hai, isliye yeh sahi jawab hai.
"
Golf ka maqsad kis cheez ki kam sey kam miqdaar ko lenaa hota hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Strokes**.

The passage clearly states: ""Woh khiladi jo corse jeetnay key liye sab say kam stroke lagaata hay..."" (The player who takes the fewest strokes wins the course).
"
"Eek golf corse parr, ghaas ko kahan parr ziyadah chota kata jaata hay?","Correct answer is **B: Sabz parr**.

The passage states: ""surakh key ird gird kee ghas ko thodi der pehle hee kata gayaa hota hay aur isay sabz kehtay hain"" which translates to ""the grass around the hole is cut shorter and is called the green"". Therefore, the grass is cut shorter on the ""sabz"" (green).
"
Kisi tajarbah ka aam maqsad kiya hota hay?,"The passage states: ""tajrib yaa tajarbah woh test yaa ekhtiyar hay jis key zariah eek yaa zayed mafruzat ko rad kiya jaataa hay,"" which translates to ""experiments are tests or options through which one or more hypotheses are rejected.""

Therefore, the most accurate answer is:

**A: Eek yaa ziyadah mumkanah mafruzey ko kahtam karnaa** (Eliminate one or more possible hypotheses).
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, sciency tahqiqi ki rahnumayi karney mein kiss sey madad nahein milti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Akelaa sciency tariqah kaar**.

Here's why:

*   **P states:** ""Science daanon kaa khaas hadaf scientific tariqah say yeah malum karnaa hay keh duniya kaisay kam karti hay. dar asal yahee beshtar sciency tehqiqat kee rehnumayi karta hay. Yeah akelay kaafi nahein...""
*   **This translates to:** ""The main goal of scientists is to find out how the world works using the scientific method. In fact, this guides most scientific research. This alone is not enough...""

The passage explicitly states that the scientific method *alone* is not sufficient to guide scientific research. Other elements are needed as well. The other options (observations, eliminating hypotheses, and experiments) are all mentioned as contributing to scientific research."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, toofanon key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah sahi nahein hay?","Let's analyze the passage and the options:

*   **P (Passage):**  States that tornadoes target smaller areas compared to other storms, are destructive, can uproot trees, tear off boards, lift cars, and that the most intense 2% of tornadoes last longer than 3 hours with winds up to 480 km/h (approximately 300 mph).

*   **A:**  Toofan apney gardo nawaah mein har cheez ko tabaah karney ki salahiyat rakhtey hein - (Tornadoes have the ability to destroy everything in their surroundings) - This aligns with the passage.

*   **B:** Toofane gardo baad deegar toofanon sey chotey elaqon ko zad mein letey hein - (Tornadoes affect smaller areas than other storms) - This aligns with the passage.

*   **C:** Ziyadah tarr toofan teen ghanton sey ziyadah rahtey hein - (Most tornadoes last more than 3 hours) - **This contradicts the passage.** The passage states that only the *most intense 2%* last longer than 3 hours. This implies the majority last *less* than 3 hours.

*   **D:** Kuch toofanon mein 300 meel fee ghantah tak ki hawayein ho skati hein - (Some tornadoes can have winds of up to 300 miles per hour) - This aligns with the passage which states some have up to 480 km/h, which is approximately 300 mph.

Therefore, the statement that is *incorrect* based on the passage is **C**."
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr ziyadah tar toofanon ki wazahat karta hay?","The correct answer is **D: Wohh darakhton kon zameen sey ukhaadney ki salahiyat rakhtey hein.**

Here's why:

*   **P states:** ""Toofan darakhaton ko jadon say ukhaad detay hain"" - This directly supports option D.

Let's examine why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wohh aam tor parr teen ghantey jaari rahtey hein:** The passage states that ""sab say ziyadah shadeed do fisad toofan teen ghantay say ziyadah tak rehte hain,"" meaning most last for less than three hours.
*   **B: Wohh 480 meel fee ghantah key ird gird ki hawayein paida kartey hein:** The passage states that these wind speeds are only found in the most severe 2% of tornadoes.
*   **C: Wohh deegar toofanon sey baday elaqon ko motassir kartey hein:** The passage explicitly states that tornadoes affect a *smaller* area than other storms: ""Toofan deegar jarehana aandhiyon kee nisbat eek chhote elaqay ko apna nishanah banatay hain""
"
16vein sadee mein insano ney darjah zail mein sey kisko karnaa shuru kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Doorbeenein bananaa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the first real telescopes in Europe were made in the late 16th century.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Lense istemaal karnaa:** The passage mentions that people have been using lenses for eyeglasses for thousands of years.
*   **B: Ashyaa ko bada karnaa:** Magnifying objects has likely been done for a long time, and not exclusively in the 16th century.
*   **C: Lense banana:** People have been making lenses for eyeglasses for thousands of years."
Lense istemaal karkey insaan kab tak ashyaa ko bada kartey rahe hein?,"Sawaal P bilkul wazeh taur per bata raha hay keh insan hazaron salon sey bari beenayi key liye chashme banatay rahay hain. Is liye durust jawaab hay:

**C: Hazaron salon tak**

"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, Muhammad ka ghaar unkey ruhaani aamal yaa aqdaar key baarey mein kiya kahtey hein?","The passage describes Mohammad's deep interest in matters beyond worldly life and his frequent retreats to the cave Hira for reflection. The passage emphasizes the cave's isolation and its ability to provide complete solitude. This strongly suggests that Mohammad valued peace and seclusion.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Wohh sokun aur yaksui ki qadar kartey hein (They valued peace and seclusion):** This aligns perfectly with the description of the cave's isolation and Mohammad's use of it for contemplation. This is a very strong possibility.
*   **B: Shoro sahgab sey baahar moraqabah mein madad mil sakti hay (Meditation outside of noise can help):** While not explicitly stated, the cave's remoteness suggests it offered respite from the noise of the city and therefore a better environment for meditation. This is also a very likely answer.
*   **C: Unko bahut kam tanhayi key waqt ki zarurat thee (He needed very little time alone):** This contradicts the passage, which states he often went to the cave for reflection.
*   **D: Wohh dikhney aur suney janey sey parishaan they (They were bothered by being seen and heard):** While the passage highlights the isolation, it doesn't explicitly say he was *bothered* by being seen or heard. It is more so that he *preferred* being alone for contemplation.

Considering all this, option B is a more accurate answer as the passage highlights his preference for solitude and peace as it aided in meditation.

**Therefore, the best answer is B: Shoro sahgab sey baahar moraqabah mein madad mil sakti hay (Meditation outside of noise can help)**"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, lohey ko sabsey pahley kis cheez key liye istemaal kiya gaya thaa?","Correct answer is **A: Cross tiyaan**.

The passage says: ""Cross ties kaa istemaal shuroo key daur mein kiya gayaa thaa taakeh patriyan apni jagah parr saabit rahein. lekin tadrijan mohaqqaq kiya gayaa keh agar inn key oper iron kee step lagaa di jaye to patriyan ziyadah kaar aamad hon gee."" This indicates that iron was initially used on the cross ties (or ""inn key oper"") before being used for anything else.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, lakdi ki pahiyon ko lohey ki pahiyon sey keon tabdil kar diya gaya thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Unko patriyon parr lohey key zariyah nichey pahnaya jaa rahaa thaa**.

The passage states: ""Yeah eek aam tariqah rawaj paya gaya, lekin lohay kee wajah say lakdi kee gaadiyon key pahiyon mein ziyadah zeebaish kee jaaney lagi. Aakhirkar, laktari key pahiyon ko lohay key pahiyon say tabdeel kar diyaa gaya.""  This clearly implies that the wooden wheels were wearing down faster due to the iron on the tracks, leading to the switch to iron wheels.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, roomaniyat key zamanah key doraan afraad ki kiss cheez ki shakal bani thee?","The passage states: ""Romanawiyat key tanazur mein, jografiye nay afraad ko dhaala...""

This translates to: ""In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals...""

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Jografiyah**.
"
Darjah zail konsa bayaniyaan takniki azam key aam khiyaal ki akkasi nahein karta hay? ,"The passage describes technological determinism as a concept where:

1.  Technological progress follows an independent path, uninfluenced by cultural or political factors.
2.  Technology's impact on society is inherent and not socially conditioned.

Based on this, let's analyze the options:

*   A: ""Samaaj parr taknik key asaraat samaaji tor parr mashrut hotey hein"" - ""The impacts of technology on society are socially conditioned."" This directly contradicts the idea of technological determinism, which claims impacts are *not* socially conditioned.
*   B: ""Taknik ki taraqqi saqafat key zere asar motassir nahein hoti hay"" - ""Technological progress is not affected by culture."" This aligns with the technological determinist view that progress is independent.
*   C: ""Taknik key samaaj parr zati asaraat hotey hein"" - ""Technology has inherent effects on society."" This aligns with the technological determinist view that impacts are inherent.
*   D: ""Takniki taraqqi syaasi asaro rosukh parr mabni nahein hoti hay"" - ""Technological progress is not based on political influences."" This aligns with the technological determinist view that progress is independent.

Therefore, option **A** is the only one that does NOT reflect the common idea of technological determinism.

**Final Answer: A**"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon kamaan khinchney sey wabastah nahein hay?","Sawaal mein diye gaye ebaarat ke hisaab se, option B: ""Eek nishaan jo eek staple ki tarah dikhta hay"" kamaan khinchney se wabastah nahein hay.

Kyunkeh ebaarat mein zikr hay keh ""down bow mark eek steple yaa scoveer jaisa jis say bottom side ghaib ho"" yaani ke ""down bow mark"" staple ki tarah dikhta hay. Isliye ye kamaan khinchney ki na ke kamaan khinchney ke nateejay ki taraf ishara kar raha hay. Baqi tamam options kamaan khinchney ke nateejay ya tareeqay se talluq rakhte hain.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein kon ziyadah narm aawaz sey wabastah nahein hay?","Correct answer: A: Niche ki taraf ke kamaan ka nishaan

Explanation: The passage mentions that an upward bow (V-shaped mark) typically produces a softer sound, while a downward bow produces a stronger, more assertive sound. The option ""Niche ki taraf ke kamaan ka nishaan"" is directly related to the downward bow, which is associated with a stronger sound, not a softer one."

Drajah zail mein sey kon durust tor parr chimpanzee key haath aur pair ki ungliyon ki wazahat kartaa hay? ,"Sawal mein chimpanzee ke haath aur paaon ki ungliyon ke bare mein pocha gaya hai.

* **P:** passage mein kaha gaya hai ke insani haath, chimpanzee ke muqable mein, seedhay haathon aur pairon ki ungliyon ki chhoti haddiyon ke saath chota hai. Iska matlab hai ke chimpanzee ki ungliyan insano se zyada seedhi nahi hoti.

* **B:** passage mein kaha gaya hai ke chimpanzee ke haath aur paaon hajm aur lambayi mein yaksaan hotay hain.

* **C:** Passage mein ye zikr hai ke jab chimpanzee pichlay panjay par chalta hai to woh haath mein bojh utha sakta hai.

* **D:** Passage mein hera pheri ke liye chimpanzee ki ungliyon ke istemal ke bare mein koi maloomat nahi di gayi.

**D: Wazeh kardah**
"
Jiniyati tanawwo shaamil karney key liye konsa amal zimmah daar hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Taghayyur (Mutation)**.

Here's why:

* **Taghayyur (Mutation):** The passage explicitly states that ""Tagayyur jadeed jinyati tabdeeli shaamil karti hay"" (Mutation involves new genetic changes). These new genetic changes are the source of genetic diversity.
* **Alahedgi (Isolation):** Isolation can lead to differences accumulating between populations, but it doesn't create the initial new genetic variation.
* **Tarkibe nav (Recombination):** Recombination shuffles existing genetic variation into new combinations, but it doesn't create the new variation in the first place.
* **Wazeh kardah (Expressed):** ""Expressed"" refers to genes that are actively producing a product, not to the source of genetic diversity.

Therefore, the fundamental process responsible for introducing new genetic diversity is mutation.
"
"Ebarat mein Malumaat ki buniyaad parr, inmein sey kisko “protein key masalah” ko hal karney key liye kisi langoor ko khaana chahiye?","The correct answer is **C: Tiddiyaan** (Grasshoppers).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easier to digest but also contains a high amount of protein and all the essential amino acids.
* **It also says:** Plant sources like leaves and seeds are difficult to digest unless processed.
* **Therefore:** To solve the ""protein problem"" and get easily digestible, high-quality protein, a langur should eat animal food like grasshoppers.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, ahem amino acid ki kami ki wajah sey kon saa darjah zail masalah pesh aata hay?","The correct answer is **B: Ghezaiyyat** and **C: Maayus kun badhotri (taraqqi mein kamee)** and **D: Maut**.

The passage explicitly states that failure to meet amino acid requirements from plant resources can lead to ""taraqqi mein kamee, ghezaiyyat kee kamee, aur aakhirkar maut."" This directly translates to stunted growth (disappointing growth), nutritional deficiency, and ultimately death.
"
Kisi makhsus zaili saqafat key araakin aksar jamaat key saath apni wabastagi matlab hotaa hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Alamat ki eek shakal key tor parr tarz ka istemaal karkey**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Zeli saqafat key arkaan aksar apni rukniyat kaa esharah imtiyazi aur alamati tarz, jismein fashion, khaas usloob aur boll chaal kaa istemaal kartay huay kartay hain."" This directly says that members of subcultures use distinctive and symbolic style, including fashion, to signal their membership.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Morakkab karney ki koshish karkey:** (By trying to complicate) The text implies simplicity in showing your subculture affiliation.
*   **B: Gardo nwah key har shakhs key eteqaad ki mowafeqat karkey:** (By conforming to the beliefs of everyone around)  Subcultures are usually formed by people that DON'T agree with the beliefs of those around them.
*   **C: Samaji meyaraat ko qobool karkey:** (By accepting social standards) Subcultures are often at odds with mainstream social standards. They are formed in part because people feel marginalized by those standards.

"Ebarat mein pesh kardah nazriyah key motabiq, eek bacha key saath kiya waqea ho sakta hay jiss ki shanakht eek nasli aqalliyat key saath hoti hay jo kehh dhamki aamez rawayyah mein mashgool honey keliye eek daqyanusi tasavvur hay?","The correct answer is **B: Bachha key liye dhamki aamez rawayyah mien mashgool honey ka ziyadah imkaan hogaa.**

Here's why:

* **Premise (P):** Children become aware of negative stereotypes about their race at a young age, and these stereotypes influence their behavior. For example, if a child from a racial minority is stereotyped as not doing well in school, they might not *want* to do well once they learn about the stereotype.
* **Question (Q):** What happens to a child identified with a racial minority who is stereotyped as engaging in threatening behavior?

The premise states that children may adhere to the stereotypes to align with preconceived notions about their community. Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that the child would engage in threatening behavior to align with the stereotypes they were known for, therefore, increasing the likelihood they will engage in threatening behavior.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, nasli daqyanusiyat key baarey mein eek bachha ki jaankari ka darjah zail mein sey kis parr asar pad sakta hay?","The correct answer is **B: Unka rawayyah (Their behavior)**.

Here's why:

*   **P** explicitly states that ""yeah nasli daqyanosi unkay tarz amal ko mutissir kartay hain"" (these racial stereotypes affect their behavior). The example given is about children performing poorly in school because they internalize the stereotype associated with their racial group.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Jiss nasli aqalliyat key saath shanakht karney ka wohh intekhaab kartey hein (The racial minority they choose to identify with):** The passage doesn't talk about a child choosing their racial identity based on stereotypes. It talks about the impact of stereotypes on children who already belong to a specific racial group.
*   **C: Deegar bachhon key saath unkey talluqaat (Their relationships with other children):** While racial stereotypes can certainly *influence* relationships with other children, the passage focuses directly on the impact on the child's *own behavior*.
*   **D: Unki nasal ki pahchaan (Their racial identity):** Again, the passage suggests that children already possess a certain racial identity, and the problem stems from how stereotypes related to that identity can have a negative impact on the child's actions and performance."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kis key liye eek wahshi bachah ki mosalsal parwarish mumkin nahein hay?","The passage states that feral children raised entirely by non-human creatures exhibit behaviors similar to the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans. It also says that in some cases parents abandon children due to mental or physical deficiencies.

Given this information, here's the breakdown of why each option is or isn't possible:

*   **A: Aazadanah tor parr rahnaa (Living independently)** - The passage mentions feral children surviving on their own in the wild, so this is possible.

*   **B: Mazboot guftagu karney ki maharatein (Strong communication skills)** - The passage implies that feral children adopt the behaviors of the animals that raised them. As human speech is a learned behavior, a feral child raised by animals would likely not develop strong communication skills.

*   **C: Alag rujhanaat (Isolated tendencies)** - Feral children are often isolated, so this is a possible outcome.

*   **D: Samaji bechaini (Social anxiety)** - The passage mentions that feral children raised by animals may display fear or indifference towards humans. This can be seen as a form of social anxiety.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Mazboot guftagu karney ki maharatein** because feral children raised by animals would likely not develop human language skills."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon durust tor parr atfaal mein wahshi rawayyah ki wazahat karta hay?","Correct answer is **B: wahshi rawayyah samaajiyat ki kami ki wajah sey pinap sakta hay**

Here's why:

*   **The passage emphasizes that the lack of social participation and being neglected by adults are key factors in the development of feral behavior.** The passage states: ""Samaji ahmiyat ko ujagar karnay key liye istemaal honey waale sab say aam tareeqon mein say eek yeah hay keh bachon mein apni parwarish key doraan unn chand nakhushgawar waaqiaat kee nishandahi kee jaye, jis mein inhein balghan kee jaanib say nazrandaz kartay huay, badqismati yaa jaan boojh karr ziyadati kaa nishanah banatay huay, muashirati kaamon mein shirkat nahein karnay di gayee."" This directly supports the idea that a lack of socialization leads to feral behavior.

Let's examine why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **A: Aksar wahshi rawayyah ki wajah jismaani kharaabi hoti hay (Often feral behavior is caused by physical disability)** The passage does mention that parents may abandon children due to severe mental or physical defects, but this is only one of several possible reasons. It's not the primary or only cause of feral behavior.
*   **C: Wahshi rawayyah sirf unn bachhon mein ghaalib hota hay jinn key waldain unhein mahdood rakhtey hein (Feral behavior is only prevalent in children whose parents restrict them)** While confinement by parents is mentioned, it's not the *only* way children become feral. The passage also talks about neglect, abuse, abandonment, and children raised by animals.
*   **D: Tamaam wahshi rawayyah ki wajah sakht zahni mazooriyaan hoti hein (All feral behavior is caused by severe mental disabilities)** This is too absolute. While mental disabilities can be a factor, the passage highlights a lack of social interaction as the driving force behind feral behavior."
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail konsa amal maaash parr mabni zaraat key saath motawaatir hotaa hay?","Sahi jawab **A** aur **D** hain.

*   **D:** Ebarat mein yeh bhi bayaan kiya gaya hay key maashi zaraat mein aksar mahauliyati nizam key maqami mahfuz kardah beej istemaal hotay hain.

Is liye, option **A** aur **D** dono ebarat mein di gayi maloomat sey motabaqat rakhtay hain. Option **B** galat hay kyunkey maashi zaraat tijarti maqsad key liye nahi hotee. Option **C** bhi sahi nahi hay kyunkey ebarat aali paidawar par tavajjuh denay ki mukhalifat nahi karta, balke zikr karta hay key nizam ziyadah say ziyadah paidawar haasil karta hay magar aasaan tarakib sey."

Ye aksar taraqqi pazeer mulkon mein kisaan karte hain.

Ab hum options ko dekhte hain:

*   **A: Yeah puri tarah naamiyaati system hay:** Zaroori nahi hai ke maashi zaraat hamesha naamiyaati ho, lekin aksar saadah aur namiyati hoti hai. Ye option puri tarah durust nahi hai.
*   **B: Ismein faslein badhaney key liye munfarid taknikon ka istemaal hota hay:** Maashi zaraat mein fasal badalne ya aasaan tarakeeben istemaal hoti hain, lekin ""munfarid"" kehna sahi nahi hai.
*   **C: Iss sey mahereene zaraat ko apney purey khittey mein apni faslein bantney ki ijazat milti hay:** Yeh option bilkul galat hai. Maashi zaraat tijarti maqasad ke liye nahi hoti, balkay sirf khaanah ki zaruriyat ko poora karti hai.

This directly connects remembering successful past ""muhim karanah ravayye"" (campaigning/active approaches) with helping people adapt to changes in the local church.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Kisi shakhs ki apni tareekh ki samajh haasil karney sey kiss cheez key saath madad ho sakti hay?","The correct answer is **C: Tanzeem key andar key maqaam ki samajh haasil karnaa.**

"Jabb dimaagh ziyaadah kasrat key saath khawaab ko ujaagar krney ki koshish karta hay, to kiya cheez badh jaata hay?","The correct answer is **D: REM kaifiyaat key darmiyaan ka waqt**.

The passage states: ""Iss kaifiyat kaa badaa sabab sales khwabon kaa natijah hay jo aar ayee em halaat key darmiyani waqfah ko taweel karta hay."" This directly translates to ""The main reason for this condition is vivid dreams which results in lengthening the interval between REM phases.""

The question asks: ""Jabb dimaagh ziyaadah kasrat key saath khawaab ko ujaagar krney ki koshish karta hay, to kiya cheez badh jaata hay?"" which translates to ""When the brain tries to vividly dream more often, what increases?""

Therefore, the length of time between REM phases increases when the brain is trying to vividly dream.
"
Darjah zail konsey manfi asaraat jo aksar khawaab dekhney ko ujaagar kar skatey hein ka jism parr asar hota hay?,"Correct answer is **B: Fee raat ghatey huey REMs**

**Reasoning:**

The passage clearly states that artificially induced lucid dreams are often tiring because they lead to *longer* REM sleep intervals (""aar ayee em halaat key darmiyani waqfah ko taweel karta hay""). This implies that the *total* number of REM cycles you experience in a night is *reduced* (""Eek raat mein chand rems key saath"").

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: REM kaifiyaat key darmiyaan waqt ki ghati hui tewaalat** - This is the opposite of what the passage describes. The intervals between REM cycles are *increased* (longer).

*   **C: Khawab dekhney ko ujaagar karney parr inhesaar**- This is the *cause* of the problem (focusing on lucid dreaming), not a *negative effect* of it on the body.

*   **D: Fee raat badha hua REMs** - The passage implies that the total REMs per night are *reduced* not increased.

* **P:** The passage states ""Majazi teamein jodat key unhein meyaron kee paband hain jinn kee maruf teamein"" which translates to ""Virtual teams are equally bound by the standards as conventional teams"". This directly implies that both types of teams are expected to perform at the same standard.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage states that virtual teams have *more* autonomy than traditional teams.
* **C:** The passage discusses ""Gair maryee team intezamiya,"" a hidden management team, which is relevant to virtual teams, but doesn't apply to all conventional teams.
* **D:** The passage implies that virtual teams may operate in different time zones.

Therefore, only option A accurately reflects a similarity stated in the passage.

"Ebarat ki buniyaad par, jismaani aur majaazi teamon key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah sahi nahein hay?","Ebarat kee buniyaad par, sahi jawab hay:

**A: Rewayati teamein aam tor parr eek ziyadah aal meyaar key liye banayi jaati hein**

Is kaaran:

*   Ebarat mein aisa kuch bhi nahin likha hay jo yeh zahir karey ke rewayati teamein aam tor parr ""ziyadah aal meyaar"" ke liye banayi jaati hain. Ebarat mein sirf jismaani aur majaazi teamon kee darmiyaan ikhtelafat ka zikr hay.

Baaqi options sahi hain kiyonkeh:

*   **B: Majazi teamein aksar rewayati teamon key rabtah key noqtah key tor parr kaam karti hein** - Yeh ebarat mein bilkul wazeh hay ke majaazi team key arkaan aksar apnay qareebi maaddi group keliye raabtah kaa kam kartay hain.
*   **C: Rewayati teamon mein majazi teamon ki banisbat kam khud mukhtaari hoti hay** - Ebarat mein yeh bayaan hay ke majaazi team key arkaan mein rewayati team key arkaan kee nisbat ziyadah khud mukhtari hoti hay.
*   **D: Mukhtalif waqt key mintaqon sey majazi teamon ko faayedah pahunch sakta hay** - Ebarat mein yeh bayaan hay ke majaazi teamen mukhtalif mintaqah waqat mein mill sakti hain jo inn kee maqami intezamiya nahein samajh sakti."
Darjah zail mein sey kon koyi aisi cheez nahein hay jiss parr mashmool key nazriyaat markooz hein?,"The passage states that content theories focus on:

*   What people need and like (logon ko kiya chahiye aur kiya pasand hay)
*   Specific needs and/or desires that people have as they approach adulthood (logon kee makhsus zaruriyat aur/yaa khwohishaat hoti hain jo andar payee jaati hain jab woh baloghat kee jaanib qadam rakhtay hain)
*   Factors that make people do what they do (woh kiya awamil hain jo baaz ashkhaas ko inn baton key karnay parr aamadah kartay hain jinn ko woh kartay hain)
*   Environmental factors that influence behavior (inn key maahaul kee woh kiya ashyaa hain jo inn ko baaz ashyaa key karnay yaa nah karnay parr aamadah karti hain)

Now let's analyse the options:

*   A: Bolughat mein amali bananey waali nayi khawahishein (New desires developing in adulthood): This IS something the content theories focus on, specifically the desires people develop as they approach adulthood.
*   B: Kaisey kisi shakhs ka mahaul uskey aamal ko motassir karta hay (How a person's environment affects their actions): This IS something the content theories focus on.
*   C: Andaruni zaruriyaat (Internal needs): This IS something the content theories focus on.
*   D: Logon ki pasandidgiyaan samajhnaa (Understanding people's preferences): This IS something the content theories focus on.

So, the answer is **A: Bolughat mein amali bananey waali nayi khawahishein**. While the passage mentions desires arising around adulthood, this option emphasizes desires *developing* in adulthood. The passage focus is on those arising *as they approach* adulthood. However, since all other options are definitely addressed in the passage, this one is the least directly covered, even if still related.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is **A**."
Darjah zail mein sey kon teesron key qaedon ka maful nahein hay?,"The passage P describes the **Rule of Thirds**. It explains how the Rule of Thirds divides an image into nine equal parts by two horizontal and two vertical lines. The intersection points of these lines are considered the most effective places to position the subject. This helps create balance, dynamism, and visual interest.

Now let's analyze the options in Q:

*   **A: Eek buniyaadi line banana jahan key liye faayel ko rakhaa jaa sakey (Creating a baseline where the subject can be placed)** - While a baseline is useful in composition, it's not a direct function or purpose of the Rule of Thirds. The Rule of Thirds focuses on *where* along those lines (or intersections) the subject should be.

*   **B: Eek tasweer key andar zindagi aur taqat bananaa (Creating life and power within an image)** - This *is* a benefit of the Rule of Thirds. Placing the subject off-center, according to the rule, often creates a more dynamic and engaging image.

*   **C: Faayel ko makhsus aur moassir maqaam mein rakhnaa (Placing the subject in a specific and effective location)** - This is a core function of the Rule of Thirds. It guides you to place key elements at the intersection points or along the dividing lines.

*   **D: Kisi tasweer mein tarteeb qayem rakhnaa (Maintaining order in an image)** - The Rule of Thirds helps create visual order and balance within the frame.

Therefore, option A, ""Eek buniyaadi line banana jahan key liye faayel ko rakhaa jaa sakey,"" is **NOT** a direct function or result of applying the Rule of Thirds. The rule uses lines to create strategic intersecting points and areas, rather than specifically create base lines.

**Answer: A**

Darjah zail mein sey kon 35mili meter ki shakal ki wazahat nahein kartaa hay?,"Sawal ke mutabiq, darjah zail mein sey konsa 35 milli meter ki shakal ki wazahat nahi karta?

Sawal mein diye gaye passage ke mutabiq:

*   35 milli meter duniya mein sab say aam jaamid image photography farmat hay. (D sahi hay)
*   Yeah aaj bhee tayyaar kee jaati hay. (A sahi hay)
*   Iss kaa soorti tanasub digital camera tasveeri censor farmats say aaya hay. (B sahi hay)
*   Bahut say mushtarak formats iss tanasub nazar key baraabar yaa taqriban qareeb tar hain. (Iska matlab hai 35mm wale format ke jaisa aspect ratio hota hai dusre formats ka, mukhtalif nahi hota)

Iss liye, **C: Ismein bahut si aam shaklon ki banisbat eek mukhtalif pahlu ka tanasub hay** sahi jawab hay kyunkay yeah 35 milli meter ki shakal ki wazahat nahi kartaa. 35 milli meter farmat ka aspect ratio bahut si aam shaklon kay qareeb tar hota hay, mukhtalif nahi hota."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, jabb tayyaar karney walon ney lens key masnuah key meyaar ko badha dety hein, to zoom lenso ko behtar kaisey kiya gaya hay?","The correct answer is **C: Unka tasveeri meyaar tay shudah focal lambayi waley lenson key momasil hota hay**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Lens masnuaat mein lens tayyaar karnay waalon key aala meyaar haasil karr lenay key baad yeah muamilah apni ahmiyat khota jaa rahaa hay. Iss nay zoom lenses ko aisi meyari tasavir pesh karnay key qaabil banaya hay jokeh muqarrar kardah tool maaskah lenses say haasil kee jaaney waali tasavir key muqabilay kee hon."" This directly translates to: ""After lens manufacturers achieve high standards in lens production, this issue is losing its importance. This has enabled zoom lenses to produce images of such quality that they are comparable to the images obtained from fixed focal length lenses.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Unmein lens ki ziyaadah raftaarein hoti hein** - (They have higher lens speeds) The passage indicates the opposite; zoom lenses generally have a smaller maximum aperture (slower lens speed).
*   **B: Kam roshni ki surate haal mein unhein istemaal karnaa ziyadah aasan hay** - (They are easier to use in low-light situations) - The passage specifically mentions that cheaper zoom lenses are difficult to use in low light without a flash.
*   **D: Ibtadayi lenson ki banisbat inmein kam focal uljhan hoti hay** - (They have less focal complexity compared to primary lenses) - The passage initially states that zoom lenses *have* more focal complexity.
"
"Ebarat mein malumaat ki buniyaad parr, zoom lens ko ibtadayi lens parr kabb tarjeeh dee jaa sakti hay?","Sahi jawab hai: **None of the above.**

Di gayi ibarat mein, zoom lens ko ibtedayi lens par kab tarjeeh dee jaa sakti hai iska koi wazeh jawab nahi hai. Balki, ibarat mein zoom lens ke fawaid aur nuqsanaat bayan kiye gaye hain.

* **Fawaid:** Zoom lenson mein mukhtalif focal length hasil karne ki salahiyat hoti hai, aur ab, lens tayyar karne walon ki maharat ki wajah se, zoom lenson ki quality fixed focal length lenson ke qareeb aa rahi hai.
* **Nuqsanaat:** Zoom lens ka maximum aperture (raftaar) aam taur par kam hota hai, jiski wajah se kam roshni mein flesh ke baghair saste zoom lens istemal karna mushkil ho jata hai.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that Sufism *distinguishes itself* from other religious forms by its direct, personal experience of divine reality. Option D states that this emphasis on direct personal experience is ""comparable"" to many other religious beliefs and practices. This contradicts the passage's central point about Sufism's unique focus.  The other options align well with the description of Sufism in the passage.

*   The passage mentions that the Indus Valley Civilization (Waadi Sindh kee tehzeeb) encompassed ""shumaal mashriqi elaqon parr moheet barre sagheer hind key shumaal maghrib mein kaansey key ahed kee tehzeeb thee,"" meaning *some* northeast regions of Afghanistan. The word ""tamaam"" (all) makes option C incorrect because not the *entire* northeast region was associated with the civilization.

The other options are correct as:

*   **Sarasvati nadi**: The passage mentions that some scholars argue it should be called the Sindh-Saraswati Civilization because evidence suggests it existed in the basins of the now-dry Sarasvati River.

*   **Bahut saa jadid daur ka Pakistan**: The passage says the civilization covered ""daur jadeed key pakistan key ziyadah tar hisson,"" meaning most parts of modern-day Pakistan."

Templars key ahed sey pahley kiss waqt ka dor aaya thaa?,"Correct answer is C: Shuruaati qoroone wustaa
The text mentions that the events took place in the era that is commonly known as the Middle Ages (11th, 12th, and 13th centuries). After the Early Middle Ages, came the High Middle Ages, and then the Late Middle Ages. Therefore, the era before the Templars was the Early Middle Ages.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, sikh mazhab key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr mazhab ki tasveer kahsi nahein karti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Sikh mazhab hindu rewayat key andar firqah ki ee tafreeq ka natijah thaa** (Sikhism was the result of sectarian division within the Hindu tradition).

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** Sikhism arose from disagreements with ancient Hinduism in the Punjab region, but Sikhs consider their faith distinct while acknowledging Hindu foundations and traditions.

*   **Why the other options are correct according to the passage:**

    *   **B: Guru sikh mazhab key liye eek buniyaadi pahlu hay** (The Guru is a fundamental aspect of Sikhism) - The passage explicitly mentions the importance of the Guru concept.
    *   **C: Naw guruon mazahab key baani, Guru Nanak key baad aaye** (Nine Gurus came after the founder of the religion, Guru Nanak) - The passage states that nine more Gurus followed Guru Nanak.
    *   **D: Sikh mazhab ki makhsus rewayaton ki jadd hindu mazhab mein hay** (The roots of Sikhism's specific traditions lie in Hinduism) - The passage acknowledges Hindu foundations and traditions.

*   **Why option A is incorrect and the right answer:** Option A suggests sikhism started with differences in Hindu tradition. However, the passage describes sikhism as originating from disagreements with Hindu tradition, and that the sikhs viewed it as different to hinduism, instead of a sect within the tradition.
    Option A does not describe sikhism accurately, and is therefore the right answer."

*   The passage states that children with ADD are more prone to getting into trouble, fighting, and clashing with law enforcement ""takeh unn key dimagh ko sokoon milay, chonkeh unn kaa dimagh aam tareeqon say sokoon nahein paataa."" This translates to ""so that their brains can find peace because their brains don't find peace in normal ways."" This implies that they seek out these dangerous behaviors as a way to stimulate or soothe their brains when other methods are ineffective.
*   While the other options might be indirectly related, the text explicitly connects the dangerous behaviors to the need for brain stimulation."

Darjah zail mein sey kon durust tor parr scaffolding key tasavvur ki wazaht nahein karta hay?,"Sawaal yeh pooch raha hai ke diye gaye options mein se kaun sa option scaffolding ke tasavvur ko durust tor par wazeh nahin karta.

Pehlay passage ko dekhte hain:

*   **Passage mein:** ""Iskay folding seekhnay kaa eek tariqah nahein hay, balkeh yeah unn afraad ko madad farahim karta hay jo eek nayey computer programme kaa istemaal karnay yaa eek naya project shuroo karnay jaise seekhnay key eek nayey tajarbay say guzar rahay hain."" Is se pata chalta hai ke scaffolding seekhnay ke ek khaas tareeqe ki bajaye, seekhne ke tajarbe mein madad faraham karta hai.

Ab options ko dekhte hain:

*   **A: Scaffolds majazi tor parr baahr ho sakta hay:** Passage mein likha hai ""Virtual scaffolds software mein androoni tor parr nasab kiye jaatay."" Lekin is sey yeh pata chalna mushkil hey keh woh baahir ho sakta hey yaa nahin.
*   **B: Yeah tariqaye taleem ki banisbat taawun ziyaada hay:** Passage ke mutabiq, scaffolding ek taawun hai. Isliye yeh option durust ho sakta hai.
*   **C: Yeah neez project parr mabni taleem key tor parr jaana jata hay:** Passage mein is baat ka koi zikr nahin hai ke scaffolding ko project parr mabni taleem ke tor par jana jata hai. Dar haqeeqat, passage mein is baat ki taraf ishara kiya gaya hai ke scaffolding project parr mabni taleem mein seekhne ko aasaan banane mein madad karta hai, lekin yeh dono ek hi cheez nahi hain.
*   **D: Scaffolds ka istemaal taleemi tajarbah key aaghaz mein himayat ki peshkash karney key liye hota hay:** Passage mein is baat ka zikr hai ke scaffolding naye seekhne ke tajurbay mein madad karta hai, jo aaghaz mein zaroori hai.

Sabse galat option hai **C: Yeah neez project parr mabni taleem key tor parr jaana jata hay**, kyunki passage mein is baat ka zikr nahi hai aur scaffolding ko project parr mabni taleem ke saath confuse nahi karna chahiye. Scaffolding project parr mabni taleem ko madad karta hai.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C**.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, MySpace ki kon si khosusiyat unn talabah ko faayedah pahuncha sakti hay jinhein padhney mein dushwari hoti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Takhsees (Customization)**.

Here's why:

The passage mentions that MySpace pages can be customized to make them easier to read and adjust colors. This customization feature directly addresses the needs of students who have reading difficulties, as they can tailor the appearance of the page to suit their individual preferences and visual needs.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Blogz (Blogs):** While blogs might be a feature of a MySpace page, the passage doesn't specifically say they directly benefit students with reading difficulties. In fact, long blocks of text in blogs might be challenging for them.
*   **C: Eek web patah (A web address):** Having an easy-to-remember web address is helpful, but it doesn't directly address the challenges of reading comprehension or visual processing difficulties.
*   **D: 54 million profilein (54 million profiles):** The number of profiles is irrelevant to a student's ability to read the content."

*   **A: Saqafati ikhtelaafat (Cultural differences):** The passage explicitly mentions ""saqafat key tasadum"" (clash of cultures) as a factor leading to the deterioration of relations.
*   **C: Motazaad amal kaariyaan (Conflicting methodologies/processes):** The passage mentions ""amal key tasadum"" (clash of processes) as a factor that caused the conflict.
*   **D: Nizamon key baarey mein tanazuaat (Conflicts about systems):** The passage mentions ""nizam key tasadum"" (clash of systems) as a factor that caused the conflict.

*   **B: Jarmani key baarey mein nazriyaat (Ideologies about Germany):** While Germany was the common enemy that initially united the USSR and USA, the passage doesn't explicitly state that *differing views about Germany after the war* contributed to the Cold War. The focus is on broader clashes of ideology, systems, culture, and processes."
Darjah zail mein sey kon durust tor parr aasab key tasalsul ko purey jism mein bhejney key maqsad ki wazahat nahein karta hay?,"Sawaal ka mafoom yeh hai ke asabi tasalsul (nerve impulses) jism mein bhejney ka maqsad kya nahi hai?

Diye gaye jawaabat mein se:

*   **C: Hayatiyaat ko barqaraar rakhnaa** aur **D: Mumkanah jismaani khatraat sey bachnaa** dono hi P mein zikr kiye gaye hain, is liye yeh asabi tasalsul bhejney ke maqasid hain.

*   **A: Khoon key bahao ko aahistah karnaa** aur **B: Khoon key bahao ka bando bast karnaa** dono hi P mein zikr nahi kiye gaye aur na hi yeh aam tor par asabi tasalsul bhejney ke maqasid mein shamil hain.

Lekin, **B: Khoon key bahao ka bando bast karnaa (stopping blood flow)**, A: Khoon key bahao ko aahistah karnaa (slowing blood flow) se zyada door ki cheez hai asabi tasalsul bhejney ke maqsad se. Asabi tasalsul ka asal maqsad jism ke functions ko barqarar rakhna aur khatron se bachna hai, blood flow ko rokna ek extreme aur unusual response hai.

Isliye, sabse durust jawaab hai:

**B: Khoon key bahao ka bando bast karnaa**
"
Giza Plateau mein kiya mil sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Azeem ahraam** 

Although options A, B, and D are all true, D is the best and most comprehensive answer since it specifically mentions the Great Pyramid, the most prominent structure on the Giza Plateau, before encompassing everything else.
"
Azeem ahraam ka maqsad kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Firaun ki izzat afzayi karnaa (To honor the Pharaoh)**

The passage explicitly states:

*   ""Misriyon key zariye teesri sadee qabal maseeh mein banaya gayaa azeem ahraam kayee eek wasee ahraam kee emaraton mein say eek hay jo murdah firaun key ehteram mein tameer kee gayein."" (The great pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of several vast pyramid structures built in honor of the deceased pharaohs.)
*   ""Azeem ahraam ko firaun khufu kee takreem mein tameer kiya gayaa..."" (The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu...)

Therefore, the primary purpose of the Great Pyramid was to honor the Pharaoh."
Mandir ko tabaah karney waley aatish zan key baarey mein hamaari jankari ka kon zimmah daar hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Strabo**.

The text states that ""Yunani muarrikh austribo nay baad mein uskaa naam darj kiya, jiski wajah say ham aaj usay jaantay hain"". This translates to ""Greek historian Strabo later recorded his name, which is why we know him today"". Therefore, Strabo is responsible for our knowledge of the arsonist who destroyed the temple.
"
Artemis key mandir ki tameer nav key baarey mein konsa durust bayaniyah hay?,"Correct Answer: B

Explanation:

The passage states: ""Badshah kee haisiyat say sikandar nay mandir kee baaz tameer key liye adayegi kee peshkash kee lekin usay thukra diyaa gayaa. baad mein sikandar kee maut key baad mandir ko 323 qabl maseeh mein dobarah tameer kiya gayaa.""

This clearly indicates that the reconstruction of the Temple of Artemis happened *after* Alexander the Great's death. So, option B is the accurate statement.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, sabsey pahley kabb hua thaa kehh parjatiyaan do pairon par chali theen?","The correct answer is **A: Saat million saalon pahley**.

The passage states that *Sahelanthropus* may have walked on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
"
Inmein sey konsi parjaatiyaan baqaedah do pairon parr chalti theen?,"The correct answer is **B: Homo Erectus** and **D: Australopithecus**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Insaanon nay homoviracts (yani seedha khadaa aadmi) kee namoodar honey key saath hee do million saal pehle say seedha paidal chalna shuroo kardiya,"". Which means *Homo Erectus* walked upright.

*   The passage also indicates ""Australopatics fosalz mein do qadmon parr chalnay kee takhissusaat 4.2-3.9 million saal pehle say payee jaati hain,"". This indicates that the *Australopithecus* had some adaptations for walking on two legs.
*   The passage indicates that Sahelanthropus ""Shayed"" i.e. maybe walked on two legs, this means there is no definitive indication in the passage that this is the case.
*   ""Do paya ki takhseesaat"" means ""two footed adaptations"" which is not a species.

Therefore both B and D are correct."
Jarmani ka bahriyah WWII key doraan kis cheez ko mokammal karney ki koshish kar raha thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Bartaniyaah ko log aur saaman wosul karney sey rok raha thaa**

The passage states that the German navy, using U-boats, was trying to stop the traffic of people and supplies across the Atlantic from America to Britain.
"
"Ebarat mein dee gayi malumaat ki buniyaad parr, Shumaali Atlantic muhim key doraan bahri jang mein sabsey ziyadah kamiyabi kis key paas thee?","Let's analyze the passage:

*   The passage describes the North Atlantic campaign during WWII.
*   The Allies (specifically, the Americans trying to help Britain) were trying to transport people and supplies across the Atlantic.
*   The German navy (using U-boats) was trying to stop them.
*   The passage implies that if the Allies failed, Germany would have conquered Britain.

This clearly indicates that the Germans were *trying* to be successful in stopping the transport, but the final sentence hints their failure.

Therefore, from the information in the text, the British and Americans were ultimately more successful because their failure would have led to Britain's conquest.

So the correct answer is:

**A: Bartanavi aur Ameriki** (British and American)"
Jabb ashuriyon ney Ghodwaar foj key istemaal ka nifaaz kiya thaa to kiya cheez mojud nahein thee?,"The passage states that ""zeen abhi tak eejaad nahein hoyee thee iss liye aashuri ghod sawaar ghodon kee nangay kamar parr baith key ladtay they."" (The saddle had not yet been invented, so the Assyrian cavalry fought by sitting on the bare backs of horses).

Therefore, the correct answer is A: Zeenein (Saddles).
"
Ghodswari istemaal karney waali ladaiyaan kaisey ladi jaati hein?,"The passage clearly states: ""aashuri ghod sawaar ghodon kee nangay kamar parr baith key ladtay they.""  This means they fought on the backs of horses.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **C: Ghodon ki pusht parr**
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, awsat Beebi loan shahri aap ko kahaan nahein milein gey?","The correct answer is **D: Andruni panaah gaah mein qurbaniyaan lekar aana**.

The passage states that only priests were allowed inside the ""haram"" (inner sanctuary). Therefore, the average Babylonian citizen would not be found bringing sacrifices to the inner sanctuary.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon khaas tor parr pujariyon key liye they?,"Sahi jawaab hai: **B: Andruni pnaah gaahein**

Explanation: Paragraph mein saaf taur par likha hai ke ""Harr mandir key andar eek khulaa ahatah hota hay aur uss key andar eek haram hota hay jis mein faqat parohit daakhil ho sakta hay.""  ""Haram"" se muraad andruni pnaah gaahein (inner sanctums) hai, aur ye sirf pujariyon ke liye mehdood thi."
Badshah Tutankhamun ko kabb badnami mili thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Unkey maqbarah ki daryaaft key baad** (After the discovery of his tomb).

The passage states that Tutankhamun was not considered important in ancient times and was not mentioned in lists of ancient kings. He only became famous after the discovery of his tomb in 1922.
"
Badshah Tutankhamun ko kis cheez ney misr ka mashhoor badshaah banaa diya?,"The correct answer is **A: Unkey bezarar maqbarey ki daryaaft (The discovery of his undisturbed tomb)**.

The passage states that Tutankhamun became a famous figure after the discovery of his tomb in 1922. It also emphasizes that the tomb was undisturbed, unlike many others which had been looted. This is the key factor in his modern fame.
"
Unani shayer Homer kiya karney key qaabil nahein thaa?,"Correct answer: B: Dekhney (Seeing)

Explanation:

The passage states that Homer was a ""legendary blind poet"" (afsanvi nabinah shayer). ""Nabinah"" means blind. Therefore, Homer was unable to see.
"
Kon mashhoor unani adab key alawah kisi aur cheez key liye mashhoor thaa?,"Correct answer: C: Pythagoras

Explanation:

*   The passage mentions Pythagoras as a famous Greek mathematician known for his theorem about right triangles.
*   Sophocles and Aristophanes are mentioned as popular playwrights.
*   Homer is mentioned as a legendary blind poet known for the Iliad and Odyssey."
Hebrew khandaan ney apnaa ziyadah waqt kahaan guzaara thaa?,"Sahi jawaab hai: **A: Khuli fazaa mein**

Diye gaye passage mein saaf likha hai ki ziyadah tar Nasrani (Christian) family khuli hawa mein raha karti thi.
"
Hebrew khandaan key liye kiya cheez ziyadah ahem nahein thee?,"Sawal ka jawab C hai, Unkey ghar.

Di gai ibarat mein wazeh tor par kaha gaya hai ke Mashriqi Wusta ke garam mahol mein ghar itne ahem nahi thay. Is liye, Hebrew khandaan ke liye ghar ziyada ahem nahi thay."
Scandinavian mamalik key darmiyaan ekhtelaaf key tor parr darjah zail mein sey kiski wazahat nahein hoti hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Zameen (Land)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions disagreements between Scandinavian countries regarding **history (tawarikh)**, **people (awaam)**, and **customs (aaraaf)**.
*   While ""green land"" is mentioned in the context of Erik the Red's journey, the passage doesn't suggest disputes between the countries themselves over territory or land boundaries.

Therefore, the passage does not explain disagreements related to *zameen* (land) between Scandinavian countries."
Greenland mein sabsey pahley kon moqim huey thay?,"The correct answer is **A: Eskimo qabail**.

The passage states: ""Lekin uss kee driyaft say qataa nazar uss waqat schemo qabail pehle hee say vahan abad they."" This translates to: ""Regardless of its discovery, at that time Eskimo tribes were already settled there.""
"
Konsi jamaat kusiyon key begair khaney ko tarjeeh deti hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Maldaar romi mard**

The passage states: ""jahaan garib afraad aur khwateen apna khaana kursiyon parr baith karr khaatay they, wahein umaraa ko mill kar aisi ziyafat kaa ehtemam pasand thaa jahaan woh khaana khaatay hoay karwat key bal leyt payein."" This translates to: ""where poor people and women would sit on chairs to eat their food, the rich liked to arrange feasts where they could lie on their sides while eating."" ""Umaraa"" translates to rich people, and while it doesn't explicitly mention men, the context of feasts (ziyafat) in ancient Rome implies that the elite participants would have been men.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon qadeem romi dawat ka hissah nahein hoga?,"The correct answer is **D: Bhuna hua turkii khana ki eek thaali**

The passage explicitly states that ancient Romans never tasted turkey. The other options are all mentioned as being part of or related to ancient Roman feasts.
"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail mein sey kiskey jaari asar rahney ka imkaan nahein hay?","The passage states that small cultures often disappear without leaving sufficient historical evidence, failing to be recognized as complete civilizations.  The other options (society, city-state, and civilized culture) are all presented as having a higher likelihood of long-term impact.

Therefore, the answer is **B: Eek choti saqafat**.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, mulk sey aagey badh kar kiya hota hay?","The correct answer is **C: Eek shahar ki halat**.

The passage states: ""Shahar- riyasatein mulk kee khabar rasaan hoti hain."" which translates to ""City-states are the news of the country."" While not a direct ""moving forward,"" it implies that city-states represent or inform the country. The other options are not directly linked to moving *beyond* the country in the context of the provided passage.
"
Drukgyal Dzong key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah sahi nahi hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Isko tibbat ki mongol fojon ki jeet ka jashan mananey key liye tameer kiya gaya thaa** (It was built to celebrate the victory of the Tibetan Mongol forces).

The passage states that the Dzong was built to commemorate Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel's victory *against* the Tibetan Mongol forces. Therefore, option A is the incorrect statement. The other options are all true based on the provided text.
"
Konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr Drukgyal Dzong mein aag key natijah ki wazahat karta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Akeli bachi hui baqiyat Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal ki tasweer thee.**

The passage states that after the fire in 1951, only a few relics remained, ""such as the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang."" The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tibbat ki mongol fojein faateh theen** - The passage says Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal built the fortress to *commemorate his victory* against the Tibetan-Mongol forces.
*   **C: Kashish ki shohrat motassir nahein hui thee** - While the passage says it remained a popular destination, it doesn't explicitly state if the fire *affected* its popularity. Option A is a more direct consequence of the fire.
*   **D: Isko Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel ney mahfooz kiya thaa** - The passage states that the fortress was *preserved* after the fire, not necessarily by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel himself. Furthermore, the fire happened long after his lifetime.
"
Cambodia key baarey mein darjah zail konsa bayaniyah sahi nahein hay?,"Sahi jawab hai **B: Cambodia ney 1772 mein Thailand parr hamlah kiya thaa**.

Dye bayaniyah darust nahein hai kyunkey diye gaye passage mein wazeh taur parr kaha gaya hai key 1772 mein Thai logon ney Phnom Phen ko tabah kiya thaa, Cambodia ney Thailand parr hamlah nahein kiya thaa. Baqya bayaniyah passage mein di gayi maaloomaat say sahi hain.
"
Konsa darjah zail bayaniyah Cambodia key hamlah ki wazahat karta hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Thai logon ney Cambodia parr kayi baar hamlah kiya thaa.**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states, ""18vein sadee mein thayiyon nay kambodiya parr kayee baar hamlay kiyey..."" (In the 18th century, the Thais attacked Cambodia multiple times).
*   Option A is incorrect, as the text only mentions the Vietnamese attacking in the latter part of the 18th century but not multiple times.
*   Option B is incorrect, because it's only the Thais who attacked Cambodia in 1772 according to the text
*   Option C is incorrect as the text specifies that it was the Thai who destroyed Phnom Penh, not the Vietnamese."
Dutch East India Company ney Taiwan mein apney waqt key doraan darjah zail mein sey kiya nahien kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Qing Saltanat key liye Taiwan key cede control ki khawahish ki**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, altered local grain production methods, and employed Chinese laborers on their plantations. This confirms options A, B, and C.

*   The passage does not indicate that the Dutch East India Company ever wished to cede control of Taiwan to the Qing Dynasty. In fact, they were ousted later by Koxinga."
Shimonoseki key moahedah ney kiya qayem kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Taiwan parr Japan ka iqtedaar**.

The passage states that after losing the First Sino-Japanese War, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which relinquished its authority over Taiwan to Japan.
"
Kisi kimiyaa ki pH satah ki paimaish kaisey ki jaati hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Kimiyayi mein Hydrogen ions ki miqdaar**.

The passage states: ""Test kiyey gaye chemical mein ph level ko hydrogen aayoon kee miqdar (the h in ph) say zahir kiya jaataa hay."" This directly translates to: ""The pH level in the tested chemical is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH).""
"
Hydrogen ions sey kisko hataya gaya thaa?,"Sawaal mein saaf taur parr bataaya gaya hay keh ""Hydrogen barq paaray woh protoon hain jinn key electron unhein alag kartay hain."" Iss sey pata chalta hay keh hydrogen ions say electron hataya gaya thaa.

Lehaza, sahih jawaab hay:
**D: Electron**

*   **A: Wohh kutton key jhund key momasil bartao krtey hein:** Nas mein kaha gaya hay keh sher key garoh bhediyon ya kutton key grohon kee tarah kaam kartay hain, is liye yeah bayan durust hay.
*   **B: Mozakkar sey moannas tak ka tanasub yaksaan hay:** Nas mein bataya gaya hay keh sher kaa garoh taqriban tees moannas aur bachon key saath eek say teen mutalliqah baaligh narr parr mushtamil hota hay, is liye mozakkaron ka tanasub moannas sey yaksaan nahi hota. Yeah bayan ghalat hay.
*   **C: Mozakkaro moannas sab qareeb sey motallique hein:** Nas mein bataya gaya hay keh khwateen behnon aur betiyon key eek baday khandaan key tor parr, omuman eek dosray say bahut qareebi taalluq rakhti hain. Narr bhi mutalliqah hotay hein, is liye yeah bayan durust hay.
*   **D: Wohh mohlik aur samaaji dono hein:** Nas mein bataya gaya hay keh apnay shikaar key liye bahut mohlik hotay hain aur samajee rawayye waali nasal hay, is liye yeah bayan durust hay.

Is liye, durust jawab **B: Mozakkar sey moannas tak ka tanasub yaksaan hay** hay, kyonkeh yeah bayan sheron key fakhr ki sahih wazahat nahin karta."
Darjah zail konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr sheron key bartao ki wazahat nahein karta hay?,"Sawaal mein diye gaye paragraph ke mutaabiq, sher:

*   Bahut samaji hote hain (A durust hai)
*   Unka bartao bhediyon se milta julta hai (B durust hai)
*   Shikaar ke liye mohlik hote hain

Lekin paragraph mein yeh nahin kaha gaya ke sirf nar shikaar ke liye mohlik hote hain ya maada bhi. Is liye, C ghalat ho sakta hai.

Paragraph mein yeh wazeh taur par kaha gaya hai ke unka bartao doosri badi billiyon se nahi milta. Is liye, D ghalat hai.

Chunke C ka sahih hona yaqini nahi hai, lekin D wazeh taur par ghalat hai, is liye sahih jawab **D** hai.
"
Khargosh kis qism key shikaari key liye aam shikaar hota hay?,"Sawaal mein diye gaye P paragraph ke mutaabiq, darmiyani qadd kee billiyan khargosh se lekar baarah singha aur hirran tak ka shikaar karti hain. Isse pata chalta hay ke khargosh darmiyani qadd kee billiyon ka aam shikaar hain.

Isliye, sahih jawaab **C: Darmiyanah size waali billiyan** hay.
"
Ziyadah choti billiyaan aam tor parr darjah zail mein sey kiska shikaar karti hein?,"The correct answer is **A: Choohey**.

The passage states that smaller cats, including domestic cats, eat insects and mice, which are referred to as ""choohey"".
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon Billi jaisey janwaar key shikaar key tariqah ka hissah nahein hay?,"Sahi jawab hai: **A: Apney gardo nawah mein chalaang laganaa**

Explanation:

*   Passage mein kahin bhi yeh zikar nahin hay keh medani cheeta apnay girdo nawah mein chalaang lagata hai.
*   Baaki tamam tariqay, jaise shikaar ki boo ka peecha karna, raat key doraan shikaar karna, aur chote size key janwaron ka shikaar karna, passage mein bayan kiye gaye hain."
Darjah zail mein sey kon billi jaysey janwar ki durust tor parr wazahat nahein karta hay? ,"Sawal (Q) pooch raha hai ke diye gaye bayaanat mein se kaun sa billi jaise janwar (yahaan medani cheetah ke hawale se) ki durust taur par wazahat nahin karta hai.

*   **A: Woh raat mein achey sey shikaar karney key qaabil hein:** Ye bayan durust hai. Passage mein likha hai ke medani cheetah shabana basarat ke zariye tariki mein achhi tarah dekh sakta hai, iska matlab hai ke woh raat mein shikaar kar sakta hai.
*   **B: Woh khamushi sey chaltey hein:** Ye bayan bhi durust hai. Passage mein likha hai ke woh chupke sey aagay bhee badh saktay hain.
*   **C: Unkey sunghney ka hassah kamzor hay:** Ye bayan ghalat hai. Passage mein wazeh taur par kaha gaya hai ke science daanon ko lagtaa hay keh medani cheetay khushbo kee benaa parr aur jis jagah rehte hain vahan sunghte hoay shikaar kaa peecha kartay hain aur janwaron ko talaash kartay hain.
*   **D: Woh chotey janwaron ka shikaar karney ko tarjeeh detey hein:** Ye bayan bhi durust hai. Passage mein likha hai ke medani cheeta chhote janwaron ko khaana pasand karta hay.

Is liye, durust jawab **C: Unkey sunghney ka hassah kamzor hay** hai, kyunki ye bayan passage mein di gayi malumaat ke khilaf hai."

Passage ke mutabiq, Cheetah ki dahaad sher ki tarah buland nahi hoti, balkeh cheekhney jaisi hoti hai.

Ibarat mein wazeh tor par kaha gaya hai, ""Sirf janwaron key paas dimagh hay (garcheh tamaam janwaron key paas nahein hay; misal key tor parr jaili machli key paas dimagh nahein hay).""  Iska matlab hai key sabhi janwaron mein dimaagh nahi hota.
"
Photosynthesis key marhalah mein podon ki kiss sey moawanat hoti hay?,"Correct answer is **D: Suraj** (Sun).

The passage states: ""Poday photosynthesis ke zariah apna khaana dhoop mein banatay hain"" which translates to ""Plants make their food in the sunlight through photosynthesis.""  Therefore, sunlight (Suraj) is what helps plants during photosynthesis.
"
Kiya cheez insaan saans sey chodtey hein jo podey saans sey letey hein?,"The correct answer is **D: Carbon dioxide**.

The passage states: ""aur woh insaanon key zariah baahar chhoday gaye (sans key zariah baahar chhoday gaye) carbon dyoxide apnay andar jazb karta hay."" This translates to ""and they (plants) absorb carbon dioxide that is released by humans (released through breath).""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail konsi misaal irteqaa key marhalah ki rokawat hoti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Choti jamaat ka nayi jagah mein badheny mein nakaam hona (A small group failing to thrive in a new place).**

Here's why:

*   **The passage describes speciation as a process where a small group becomes isolated, faces new environmental pressures, adapts, and eventually diverges so much that it becomes a new species.** A small group failing to establish itself in the new environment would halt the speciation process. There would be no new population to adapt and diverge.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Eek aabadi key hissah ka naye mahaul mein muntaqil hona (A part of the population moving to a new environment):** This is the *starting point* for speciation, not a hindrance.
*   **C: Eek aabadi ki motabeqat karna, yeah eek naye mahaul mein mowafiqat hoti hay (A population adapting, or becoming suited, to a new environment):** This is a *key part* of speciation, not a hindrance.
*   **D: Eek aabadi ka hadsaati tor parr do ki tashkeel karna (A population accidentally forming into two):** While isolation is a factor in speciation, the text emphasizes the role of environmental pressures and adaptation. Accidental division without these pressures wouldn't necessarily lead to speciation as described."
Darjah zail konsa bayaniyah takhsees key marhalah ki durust tor parr wazahat karta hay? ,"The correct answer is **C: Yeah nayi parjatiyon ki tashkeel ka hawalah deta hay** (It refers to the formation of new species).

The passage explicitly states: ""Ham iss amal ko takhsis kehtay hain, jis kaa matlab sirf nayi parjatiyon kee tashkil hay."" (We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Yeah uss waqt waqea hota hay jabb koyi nayi aabadi mowafiqat karney key qaabil na ho** (It occurs when a new population is unable to adapt): The passage describes speciation occurring *because* a population *does* adapt to a new environment. It's the adaptation that drives the divergence.
*   **B: Yeah irteqaa key marhalah ka ahem pahlu hay** (It is an important aspect of the evolutionary stage): Although the statement is true but its the very base and meaning of specification. hence it is not the most apt answer.
*   **D: Iska woqoo naguzer hay** (Its occurrence is inevitable): Although the statement is also true, the given options are supposed to define specification and the most apt and direct answer is (C)."
Gardish system ka konsa hissah dil tak khoon ko pahunchata hay?,"Sawal (Q) mein poochha gaya hay keh gardish system ka konsa hissah dil tak khoon ko pahunchata hay. Paragraph (P) mein bataaya gaya hay keh khoon vein ke zariye dil mein wapas aata hay.

**D: Ragein**
"
Konsey tube gardish system mein sabsey chotey hein?,"Sawaal P ke mutabiq, sab se chhote tube jo gardish system mein mojood hain, woh ""kaapi lareez"" hain. Lekin, jawabon mein ""kaapi lareez"" mojood nahin hai.

Agar hum is haqeeqat par tawajjo dein ke ""kaapi lareez"" aik qisam ki ""ragein"" hain (yani khoon ki naliyan), to sab se munasib jawab **A: Bareek royein** hoga, kyunki ""bareek royein"" ka lafz ""kaapi lareez"" ko bhi shaamil karta hai.
"
Eek keedey ki apney paron ko waapas tah karney ki salahiyat darjah zail mein sey kisko badhati hay?,"Sahi jawab **B: Jaghon ko chipana** hai.

Paragraph mein wazeh taur par kaha gaya hai ke paron ko wapas joadnay ki salahiyat keedon ko ""wahshi haiwanat say chhupnay key liye chhoti jaghon kaa eek badaa range fraham karta hay.""
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon ebarat mein kisi aisi cheez key tor parr mazkoor nahein hay jo kisi keedey ki udney ki salahiyat sey motassir hoti ho?,"Sawaal mein poocha gaya hai ke darja zail mein se kaunsi cheez ibaarat mein kisi keeday ki urne ki salahiyat se mutasir nahi hoti.

Ibaarat mein, urne ki salahiyat ke fayde zikr kiye gaye hain:

*   **Dushmanon ko khatam karna:** (Kaarkardagi se related ho sakta hai)
*   **Khorak dhoondhna:** (Gheza ekattha karna)
*   **Saathi dhoondhna:** (Afzaishe nasal se related hai)
*   **Chhupne ke liye chhoti jaghon ka range:** (indirectly zindagi ki muddat se bhi related hai, kyunki behtar chhupne se lambi umar ho sakti hai)

Isliye, saare options directly ya indirectly urne ki salahiyat se mutasir hote hain. Lekin, *Zindagi ki muddat* directly mentioned nahi hai. Baaki options *Afzaishe nasal*, *Gheza ekattha karna*, aur *Kaarkardagi* teeno keedon ki urne ki salahiyat se mutasir hone wali cheezen hain.

Lihaza, sahi jawab hai:

**B: Zindagi ki muddat**"
Darjah zail konsi khosusiyat aam tor parr dinosaur sey wabastah nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Pankhein (Wings)**.

The passage states that many people don't consider birds to be dinosaurs *because* they have feathers and can fly. The other characteristics (walking on two legs, laying eggs, having clawed feet) are mentioned as dinosaur-like traits that birds possess.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko aam tor parr parindon aur dinosaur ki mushtarekah khosusiyat nahein samjha jaata hay?,"Sahi jawab hai: **C: Udney kiu salahiyat**

Wajah:

Passage mein wazeh tor parr bataya gaya hai ke aksar log parindon ko dinosaur nahi mante kyunki woh par rakhte hain aur udne ke qabil hote hain. Is se pata chalta hai ke udne ki salahiyat ko aam tor parr parindon aur dinosaur ki mushtareka khususiyat nahi samjha jata. Baki tamam khususiyat (andey dena, chalney key liye pichley do pairon ka istemaal karna, aur panjon waley pair) passage mein parindon aur dinosaur mein mushtareka khususiyat ke tor parr zikar ki gayi hain.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Khajoor ki tarah key podah ka konsa hissa eek Triceratops key liye khana mumkin hosakta hay?","Sahi jawab hai **B: Tana**.

Aaiye is ki wajah dekhte hain:

*   Ebarat mein wazeh tor par likha hua hai ke ""Sah qarni sosmaar apni qawee chonch kaa istemaal karsakta thaa- Tanaa khaaney say pehle patton ko utaarnay keliye."" Isse zahir hota hai ke Triceratops ke liye podhe ka woh hissa jo khana mumkin tha woh tanaa tha.
*   Jabke ebarat mein bataya gaya hai ke Triceratops sakht cheezien chaba sakta tha, jaise ke jaddien, is baat ka koi zikar nahi hai ke woh khajoor ki tarah key podhon ki jaddien khaate the.
*   Ebarat mein yeah bhee likha hai ke khajoor ki tarah key podhon key siray parr tez nokeeli pattiyan hoti hain aur inhey zahreela mana jata hay, lehaza inhen khai janey ka imkaan kam tha.
*   Ebarat mein phal ka koi zikar nahein hay.

Lehaza, diye gaye ikhtiyarat mein sey, **Tanaa** hi woh hissa hai jisey Triceratops kha sakta tha."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kisko eek Triceratops key liye khana sabsey zaiyadah mumkin hay? ","Sawal ka sahi jawab hai:

**B: Sakht shaakhon walaa eek podah**

Wajah:

Ibarat mein saaf taur par zikar hai ke Triceratops ke daant itne sakht hote hain ke woh na sirf pattiyon ko balkeh tehniyon aur jadon ko bhi chaba sakte hain. Is se pata chalta hai ke sakht shaakhon wala podah Triceratops ke liye khaane ka ziyada imkan hai.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsey darjah zail khel ko wasee paimaney parr Itly key sabsey shumaali khitton mein mashhoor hay?","Sawal ke mutabiq, **""Sarmayi khel shumali mintaqon mein ziyadah maqbool hain""**. Is liye, sahi jawab hai:

**C: Baraf raani (Ice hockey)**

Kyunkay Ice hockey aik sarmayi khel hay aur ebarat mein zikar kiya gaya hay keh sarmayi khel shumali mintaqon mein ziyadah maqbool hain.
"
"Ebarat mein di gayi malumaat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail konsey khel mein itly key liye aalami championship ki jeet haasil hui hay?","Correct answer: A: Football

Explanation:

The passage explicitly states: ""Itly kee qomi football team... 2006 mein fifa world cup kee champion thee"" which means the Italian national football team won the FIFA World Cup in 2006. The FIFA World Cup is the world championship for football.

The passage mentions other sports being popular in Italy but only explicitly states the football team won a world championship.
"
Kis waqea key baad Luxembourg key makhsus hissey Belgian ban gaye thay?,"Sahi jawab hai: **B: Belgian ka inqilaab**

Diye gaye passage ke mutabiq, Belgian ke aaj ke dour ke hisse maazi mein Luxembourg ka hissa thay, lekin 1830 ke inquilabi Belgium ke baad Belgium mein shamil ho gaye.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kiska Luxembourg ki gair jaanibdari ko motassir kiya thaa?,"Correct answer is **A: Jarmani ka qabzah (Germany's occupation)**

The passage explicitly states that Luxembourg tried to remain neutral but was occupied by Germany during both World War I and World War II. This directly affected its neutrality. Other choices may be related to Luxembourg's history, but they did not influence its neutrality.
"
Turkii key kul elaaqah mein sey kitna morabbah kilometer Europe mein hay?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The passage states: ""Turki kaa raqbah bashomool jheel, 783562 morabbaa kelometer (300948 morabbaa meel) parr moheet hay, jis mein say 755688 morabbaa kelometer (291773 morabaa meel) jonub maghribi asia mein aur 23764 morabbaa kelometer (9174 morabbaa meel) europ mein hay.""

This clearly indicates that 23764 square kilometers of Turkey are located in Europe.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, taqrban kitna meel lamba turkii hay?","The correct answer is **D: 1000**.

The passage states: ""Turki kaa raqbah 1600 kelometer (1,000 meel) say ziyadah lamba aur 800 kelometer (500 meel) chodaa hay."" This directly translates to ""Turkey is more than 1600 kilometers (1,000 miles) long and 800 kilometers (500 miles) wide.""
"
Vatican shahar mein kiskey liye latini zubaan istemaal hoti hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Mazhabi taqribaat**.

The passage states that Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
"
"Vatican shahar mein, Itly zubaan kiskey liye istemaal nahein hoti hay?","The correct answer is **C: Mazhabi taqribaat**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Italian is used for ""qanoon saazi"" (legislation) and ""daftari mawasilat"" (official communication).
*   The passage also mentions that Italian is the daily spoken language.
*   The passage says Latin is used for ""mazhabi taqribaat"" (religious ceremonies)."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kisko umdah computeron parr aawaz khalt malt karney sey faayedah hota hay?","The passage clearly states: ""Mausiqi ko omuman pechidah computers kaa istemaal karkay record kiya jaataa hay taakeh aawazon par mazeed kam kiya jaye aur unhein aapas mein milaya jaye."" This means music benefits from complex computers for sound mixing.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A: Mosiqi
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss mahalle waqoo key aksar makanaat ki khosusiyat mein flush waley baitul khlaa they","The correct answer is **A: Mohenjo-daro**.

The passage states that ""Hadapah aur mohan jodaro key shehron key taqriban harr ghar mein flush baitul khala thaa"" (Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets).
"
Darjah zail kiss mahalle waqoo mein taraqqi yaaftah naalon key nezaam paye jatey thay?,"The passage states that advanced drainage systems were found in Harappa, Santorini, Egypt, and China. Therefore, all the options are correct. However, since you have to choose only one, the best answer is **A: Harappa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically mentions that nearly *every* house in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets connected to an advanced sewage system. This makes Harappa the strongest example from the text.

While the other options are mentioned, the emphasis and detail are strongest for Harappa.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon eek skater key mudney ki wajah hota hay?,"Correct Answer: A: Skate key blade key nichey thoda sa mudan

Explanation:

The passage states, ""Choon keh blade kaa bottom halka tedha hay lehaza jab blade eek yaa doosri samt jhukta hay to uss kaa kanarah jo barf key contact mein hay woh bhee tedha ho jaataa hay. Uski wajah say scatter kaa rukh murh jaataa hay..."" This directly links the slight bend (tedha) in the blade's bottom to the change in direction (murh jaataa hay) of the scatter, and therefore, the skater's turning. The other options are not the primary reason for the turning based on the information in the passage.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon durust tor parr jadid baraf key stake ki blade parr suraakh ki wazahat karta hay?","The correct answer is **A: Dohrey kinarey waala (Dohrey kinarey waala)**.

The passage explicitly states the blade has ""do dhaari"" meaning ""two edges"" or ""double-edged.""  The other options describe characteristics derived *from* the double-edged design, but the fundamental feature the question asks about is the double edge itself.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsa tariqah kaar hay jo atoms ko roshni sey ziyadah energy ko khatam karney ki ijazat deta hay?","The correct answer is **D: Taabkari ka hausalah afzaa ikhraaj (Shuaa kaa mutaharrik ikhraaj)**

The passage explicitly states: ""Sciencedan iss amal ko """"shuaa kaa mutaharrik ikhraaj"""" kehtay hain keunkeh chamakdar roshni key zariah zarraat mutaharrik hotay hain, jiski wajah say ziyaa kaa photoon khaarij hota hay, aur roshni shuaa kee eek qism hay""

This translates to: ""Scientists call this process ""stimulated emission"" because the particles of a bright light source are stimulated, which causes a photon of light to be emitted, and light is a form of radiation.""

Therefore, ""shuaa kaa mutaharrik ikhraaj"" (stimulated emission) is the method atoms use to get rid of excess energy from light.
"
Kis wajah sey eek atom photon ka ikhraaj karta hay?,"Sahi jawab hai **A: Ziyadah energy chodna**

Passage mein saaf taur par bataya gaya hai ke atom apni sabqa energy level par wapas aane ke liye photon ka ikhraaj karte hain.  Yeh faazil (ziyada) energy roshni se hasil ki jaati hai aur photon ki surat mein release hoti hai.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, keya hadsati tor parr eek roshni key bulb key kaam karna band karney ki wajah ban jaye gaa?","Sawal mein diya gaya hai ki bulb ka filament jal jaane ki wajah se bulb kaam karna band kar deta hai. Isliye, sahi jawab hai:

**C: Bulb key andar key soot ka jal jaana** (Bulb ke andar ke filament ka jal jaana)
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon roshni key bulb ko badaltey waqt mumkanah tor parr chooney key liye khatarnaak ho sakta hay?,"Correct Answer: C: Bulb ki buniyaad

Explanation: The text explicitly states that touching the metal part of the bulb base (bulb ki buniyaad) while it's still partially in the socket can cause a severe electric shock. The other options are not mentioned as being directly dangerous to touch during bulb replacement.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, nucleus key motafarriq hotey waqt keya hota hay?","The passage states: ""...tab nucleus ko dobarah taqsim karnay kee wajah say uss mein say kuchh tawanayi khaarij hoti hay."" This translates to ""then, due to the nucleus being divided again, some energy is released from it.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Tawanayi chodi jaati hay (Energy is released)**.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon lambi doori key zameen tak waapas aaney waali callz ki akkasi karta hay,"Sahi jawaab hai:

**B: Satellites**

Parragraph mein saaf taur parr zikr kiya gaya hai ki jab aap lambi doori parr kisi aadmi ko call kartay hain to aap satellite kaa istemaal kartay hain.
"
Inmein sey kiska istemaal doorbeen ko khala mein rakhney key liye hota hay?,"Sahi jawab hai **B: Rockets**

Paragraph P mein saf taur par bataya gaya hai ki satellite ko rocket ke zariye khalaa mein bheja gaya hai. Doorbeen (telescope) bhi satellite ki tarah hi khalaa mein rakhi jaati hai, isliye iske liye bhi rocket ka istemaal hoga.
"
Waqt key guzarney ka suraag laganey key liye eek gardish waley waqea key baarey mein kis cheez ko note karna chahiye?,"The correct answer is **B: Takraar (Repetition)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Aap kisee chakkar waale waaqiye kee **takraar** kaa moshahidah karkay waqt guzarnay kee nishandahi aap khud karr saktay hain."" This translates to ""You can identify the passage of time by observing the **repetition** of a cyclical event.""

While duration (doraniyah) is also related to time, the passage emphasizes the *repetition* of the event as the key to marking the passage of time.  The passage says: ""chakkarwala waaqiah eek aisi cheez hay jo baar baar baqayedgi key saath hota hay."" This mean: ""A cyclical event is something that occurs regularly and repeatedly.""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kisi waqea ka konsa pahlu mowaznah key liye istemaal honey walaa waqt hota hay?","Correct Answer: A) Tewalat

The passage states: ""Waqt yeah bhee hay keh ham kiss tarah waaqiaat key doraniye (tewalat) kaa mawaznah kartay hain.""

This translates to: ""Time is also how we compare the duration (tewalat) of events.""

Therefore, *tewalat* (duration) is the aspect of an event used for comparison in relation to time.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kisko taaj key waris key liye aam samjha jaata hay?","The correct answer is **B: Foj mein shaamil honey key liye university chodna**.

The passage states that traditionally, the heir to the throne would go directly into the army after finishing school. This implies that going to university *before* joining the army was *not* the norm. Therefore, joining the army after leaving school is something that was commonly understood as a next step for the crown heir.
"
"Ebarat mein dee gayi malumaat ki buniyaad parr, Charles keya karney walaa pahla shakhs thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Eek degree haasil karna**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Charles bartanvi shahi khandaan kaa pehla member thaa jisay degree di gayee thee."" This directly translates to Charles being the first member of the British Royal Family to be awarded a degree.
*   The passage says that before Charles, heirs to the throne would go straight into the army, so A is incorrect. B and D are things he did, but the passage doesn't say he was the *first* to do them, only that he was the first to get a degree.
"
Trygvasson ka beda kis mulk ka thaa?,"Sahi jawaab hai: **D: Norway**

The passage states that the fleet was led by Olav Tryggvason, who was a Norwegian aiming to free his country from Danish rule.
"
Tarikh mein kis waqt jarmani ney Estonia parr eek mazboot saqafati asar dala thaa?,"Sawaal mein kaha gaya hai ki ""15 vein sadee key aiss paas..."" yani 15wein sadi ke aas paas. Iska matlab hai taqriban 500-600 saal pahley.

Isliye sahi jawab hai:

**C: Taqriban 600 saal pahley**
"
Estonia ki zubaan kiss cheez sey motassir hui thee?,"Sahi jawab hai: **B: Jarmani horrufe tahajji**

Di gayi ibarat ke mutabiq, estonia ki zubaan german horoof tahajji parr mabni thee.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, madri hindi boney walon ki tadaad kis unsur ki buniyaad parr kamo besh hoti rahti hay?","Sahi jawaab hai:

**A: Agar hindi sey bahut momasil elaaqayi zubanon ko bhi shumaar kiya jaa raha hay**

Pata hai ki paragraf mein kaha gaya hai ki Hindi bolne walon ki tadaad ka farq iss baat par munhasir hai ki kareeb tor par baaham marbut lehjon ki ginti ki jaati hai ya nahin. Iss ka matlab hai ki agar Hindi se bahut milte julte elaaqayi zubanon ko bhi shumaar kiya jaa raha hai to tadaad badh jaaegi.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon hindi aur urdu zubanon key baarey mein sahi bayaniyah hay?,"Sahi jawab hai **B: Wohh rasmul khatt mein mukhtalif hoti hein**.

Diye gaye passage mein wazeh taur par kaha gaya hai ke hindi aur urdu ka zakhirahe alfaz (vocabulary) yaksaan hai, lekin tarz tehreer (script) judagana hai. Isi liye option B sahi hai.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon Hangeul horufe tahajji key baarey mein durust haqiqat nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Isko badshah Sejong key ahed key aaghaz mein ijaad kiya gaya thaa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states Hangeul was created in **1444** during King Sejong's reign (1418-1450). 1444 is not the beginning of his reign.

The other options are supported by the passage:

*   **B: Horufe tahajji ka asal naam Hunan Jeongeum thaa** - The passage states the original name was ""Honmeen Jewan Gyom"" which translates to ""Correct Sounds for the Instruction of the People"". ""Honmeen Jewan Gyom"" and ""Hunan Jeongeum"" are the same, just transliterated differently from Korean into the Roman alphabet.

*   **C: Isko Joseon saltanat key chotey badshah ney ijaad kiya thaa** - King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon dynasty.

*   **D: Isko jaan boojh kar ijaad kiya gaya thaa** - The passage says Hangeul was ""qasdan eejaad kardah"" (deliberately created)."
Horufe tahajji Hunmin Jeongeum aakhir kaar kiss sey badal gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

The passage states that King Sejong originally named the alphabet ""Hunmin Jeongeum,"" but it was later known as ""Hangeul.""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsi zubanein Sanskrit sey motssir hui theen?","The correct answer is **D: Hindustani zubanein**.

The passage states: ""...Sansikrit behad pechidah aur zarkhez zubaan hay, jis nay mutaddid jadeed hindustani zubanon key maakhaz key tor parr khidmat anjaam di hay...""

This translates to: ""...Sanskrit is a very complex and fertile language, which has served as the source for many modern Indian languages...""

Therefore, Hindustani languages were influenced by Sanskrit.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss wajah sey Sanskrit ka istemaal kam hua thaa?","Sawaal mein poochha gaya hai ke Sanskrit ka istemaal kis wajah se kam hua. Paragraph mein likha hai: ""upnishadon kee tadween key baad, mazhabi rehnumaon kee wajah say sansikrit kamzor ho gayee"".

Is liye sahi jawab hai: **D: Darjah bandi** (Kyuki tadween ka matlab darjah bandi ya compilation hota hai)
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon Io parr kashishe seql key motalliq durust bayaniyah hay?"," sahih jawab **D: Zameen ki kashishe seql Io ki kashishe seql ki banisbat aap parr ziyadah khinchao rakhey gee** hay.

Parragrah mein wazahat ki gayi hay keh Io parr kashish e seql zameen ki kashish e seql sey kam hay. iska matlab hay keh zameen ki kashish e seql aap parr Io ki kashish e seql ki banisbat ziyadah khinchao rakhey gee."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail konsa bayaniyah chaand key baahari parat ki durust tor parr wazahat karta hay?","Sawal ke mutabiq sahih jawab hai:

**C: Door ki side mein kam maria ho skati hay**

Wajah:

*   P: Ibaarat mein wazeh taur par kaha gaya hay kay ""chand kee beruni satah parat kahalati hay. Yeah crust nazdiki jaanib taqriban 70 kelometer dabiz hay aur doosri jaanib 100 kelometer dabiz hay. Yeah maariyah key neechey patla aur pahadi elaqon key neechey motaa hay."" Isse yeh zahir hota hay kay doosri jaanib crust ziyadah dabiz hay.

*   A: option side kay paas ziyadah mota hone ki bat karta hai lekin yeh nazdiki jaanib kay mutaliq batata hai lekin sawal chand kee bahri parat kay mutaliq puch raha hay, to yeah ghalat hay.

*   B: Option kehta hay kay oonchay hisson kay taht crust ziyadah patla hota hay, jo kay ebaarat kay khilaf hay kyunkeh ebaarat mein bataya gaya hay kay pahadi elaqon kay neechey motaa hota hay.

*   D: Option kehta hay kay ooncheyt hisson kay taht kam maria ho skati hay, yeah ebarat mein nahiin bataya gaya hay.

*   C: option kehta hay kay door ki side mein kam maria ho skati hay, yeah ebarat mein bataya gaya hay kay yeah chand kee bahri parat hay, aur chand ki door ki satah par maria kam hay.

Isi wajah say option C sahih hay."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, chaand ka crust sabsey mota kahaan hota hay?","Correct answer is **C: Ooncheyt hisson key taht (Hilly regions)**

The passage states: ""Yeah crust nazdiki jaanib taqriban 70 kelometer dabiz hay aur doosri jaanib 100 kelometer dabiz hay. Yeah maariyah key neechey patla aur pahadi elaqon key neechey motaa hay."" (The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the other side. It is thin under the maria and thick under the hilly regions.)
"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail mein sey kiss par kuch log yaqeen rakhtey hein?","The correct answer is **C: Doosrey sayyaron parr zindagi mojud hay**.

The passage explicitly states that ""kuch logon kaa manna hay keh kisee doosrey sayyarey parr shayed elions yaa doosri zindagiyan abad hon gee"" which translates to ""some people believe that maybe aliens or other life forms inhabit other planets.""  This directly supports option C.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage discusses the *dream* of traveling to other stars, not that humans have already done so.
*   **B:** The passage suggests it might be *difficult* due to the distance, but doesn't definitively say humans *cannot* discover other worlds.
*   **D:** The passage states the *opposite*: that the distance between stars is in the *trillions* of miles."
Jitna ziyadah aap suraj key markaz sey door jaatey hein konsi cheez utni hi patli hoti jaati hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Gas**.

The passage states: ""Agar aap sooraj key markaz say door jaatay hain to gas nisbatan patli ho jaati hay."" This translates to ""If you move away from the sun's center, the gas becomes relatively thinner.""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, suraj ka konsa hissah zameen sey maryee hay?","Correct answer is C: Roshni ka korah.

The passage states: ""Sooraj key jis khaariji juzw ko ham dekhtay hain woh photo isfair kahalata hay jis key maanee """"roshni kaa golah"""" key hain.""  This directly translates to ""The outermost component of the sun that we see is called the photosphere, which means 'sphere of light'"".
"
Darjah zail mein sey konsey moshahedah ney falakiyaat key nazriyah ki tayeed karney madad kiya thaa?,"Sahi jawab hai **A: Zuhrah key marahil**

**Wajah:**

Paragraph mein wazeh taur par bataya gaya hai ke Galileo Galilei ne zahrah (Venus) ke marahil (phases) ka mushahida kiya, aur yeh mushahida Copernicus ke us nazariye ki himayat karta hai jis mein kaha gaya hai ke sayyarey (planets) sooraj ke gird chakkar lagate hain. Is liye, Zuhrah ke marahil ka mushahida falakiyaat (astronomy) ke nazariye ki tayeed karne mein madadgar sabit hua.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kiska Galileo Galilei ney 1610 mein moshahedah kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Zuhrah key marahil**.

The passage clearly states that in 1610, Galileo Galilei observed the phases of Venus using a telescope.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Amazon darya kahaan sey paani jamaa karti hay?","Correct Answer: A
The answer is **A: Ziyadah choti daryayein** because the passage says: ""uss mein hazaaron chhote driyaon say paani bah karr jamma hota hay."" This translates to: ""thousands of small rivers flow into it and accumulate.""
"
Konsi tareef Amazon darya sey mansub nahein hay?,"Correct Answer: **C: Yeah sabsey lambi darya hay**

The passage states that the Amazon is the second longest river, not the longest. All the other options are mentioned in the passage as attributes of the Amazon river.
"
Earat mein mazkoor kaam ki konsi line Venezuela key logon ki sabsey kam tadaad ko kaam faraham karti hay?,"Correct answer: C: Oil
Here's why:
* The text states: ""only one percent of people work in the oil industry""
* The other sectors have the following approximate participation:
* Agriculture: one-fifth (20%)
* Industry: one-fourth (25%)
* Service Sector: two-thirds (66%)
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail konsa shobaa Venezuela key logon ki sabsey ziyadah tadaad ko kaam faraham karta hay?","Sahi jawab hai:

**A: Khidmat (Service)**

Ebarat mein wazeh tor per kaha gaya hai ke ""Venzuela key do tehayi log service sector mein..."" kaam karte hain, jo ke baqi shobo ki nisbat sabse ziyadah tadaad hai.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Imtezaaj sey sitaron ko keya karney ki ijaazat milti hay?","The correct answer is **C: Roshni aur garmi ko chod deney**.

The passage clearly states: ""Setaray roshni aur hararat uss energy kee wajah se kharij kartay hain jo hydrogen key zarraat key inzemam say saqeel anaasir kee takhliq say banti hay.""  This translates to ""Stars emit light and heat due to the energy produced by the fusion of hydrogen atoms to create heavier elements.""

Therefore, fusion allows stars to emit light and heat.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko eek mofeed imtezaaj ka reactor banaye gaa?,"Sawaal ke mutabiq, sitarey roshni aur hararat uss energy ki wajah se kharij karte hain jo hydrogen ke zarraat ke inzimam se saqeel anasir ki takhliq se banti hai. Scienzes daan bhi aisa hi reactor banana chahte hain.

Is bunyad par, sahih jawab **B: Sitarey** hai. Scienzes daan sitaron ke amal ko naqal karna chahte hain.
"
Paani ki kimiyayi banawat keya hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Do hydrogen atoms aur eek oxygen atom**.

The passage clearly states that water is a compound made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
"
"Jabb paani ki shaklein tabdil ho jayein gee, to konsi cheez eek jaisi rah jaye gee?","The correct answer is **A: Salmaati saakht (Molecular Structure)**

The passage states: ""...Iss key paas wahee salmati dhancha hay, aaya yeah gas hay, maaye yaa thoss. Halankeh uski jismani haalat tabdil ho sakti thee, magar uski kimiyayi haalat waisi hee barqarar rahee-""

This directly indicates that the molecular structure of water remains the same regardless of its physical state (gas, liquid, or solid).
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, makhsus qanoon nafiz karney ki koshish kartey waqt darjah zail mein sey kon tees mulkon ka masalah nahein hay?","Sawal ke mutabiq, Inqilabi jang ke dauran tees mulkon (terah riyasaton) ko darj zeel mein se kon sa masla naheen tha:

*   **A: Mulk key hukkaam ki taraf sey bhaari nigraani**

Yeh option durust hai. Ibārat mein zikr hai ke markazi hukumat riyasati hukkaam par etemad karti thi, kyunke koi qomi majlis aamila ya adliah mojud naheen thi. Lekin koi bhaari nigraani naheen thee.

Baaki options galat hain kyunke yeh ibarat mein masail ke tor par zikr kiye gaye hain:

*   **B: Congress key andar power ki kami** - Ibārat mein wazeh tor par kaha gaya hai ke congress ke paas tax aayed karnay ke liye koi taaqat naheen thee.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsa bayaniyah inqilaabi jang key doraan markazi hukumat ki kaifiyat ki akkasi durust tor parr karta hay?","Sawal mein diye gaye ebaarat ke mutabiq, sahih jawab hai:

**C: Mulk key nomaindon ki mojudgi ki kami thee**

Wajah:

*   Ebaarat mein wazeh tor par kaha gaya hai ke ""yahaan koyee qomi majlis aamilah yaa adliah mojud nahein thee"" yani qomi level par mulk ke nomaindon ki mojudgi ki kami thi jo hukumat chalane mein madad kar sakte.

Baqi options sahih nahin hain kyunke:

*   **A:** Ebaarat kehti hai ke ""Tax aayed karnay key liye congress key paas kisee bhee taaqat kaa fuqdan thaa,"" yani Congress tax naafiz nahin kar sakti thi.
*   **B:** Dafaat mein islahaat ke liye riyasaton ki ijmayi razaa darkaar thi, Congress ki zimmedari nahin.
*   **D:** Ebaarat ke mutabiq, Congress waahid juz tha, markazi hukumat do ajzaa parr mushtamil nahin thi."
Azadi key elaan ki pusht parr alfaaz kaisey likhey hein?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: Ooper ki taraf nichey.**

Here's why:

The text doesn't mention anything about large or small fonts or a code.

The New Kingdom Egyptians admired the monuments of their ancestors for their size and construction.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Unki size** and **D: Unki tameer**.  The passage mentions both size and construction quality as reasons for admiration, so either C or D would be a correct answer, but if I have to pick just one, I would say **C: Unki size** is the more direct and important reason.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, barishon key hosul mein sabzah khor janwar kahaan sey safar kartey hein?","The correct answer is **B: Shumaali pahadiyaan**.

The passage clearly states that the grazing animals migrate ""from the northern hills crossing the Mara River"" in search of rainfall.
"

"
Afriki momalik parr qabzah key itly key mansubah mein kisko zaruri qadam key tor parr zikr nahein kiya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Ezaafi jahaaz banana**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that Italy needed to **establish a troop launching pad** to invade African countries. (C)
*   It mentions they needed to get rid of **British bases and ships** in Egypt to cross the Mediterranean. (A and D - destroying the bases is essentially getting rid of them)
*   The passage explicitly says that Italy built four new fleets at the start of the war, but mentions that Italy didn't need to build **additional ships** once they have done that. (B)

Therefore, building additional ships wasn't mentioned as a necessary step in Italy's plan to conquer African countries."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kisko Itly ki jang ka buniyaadi maqsad samjha jaata thaa?","The correct answer is **A: Afiriki mamalik parr qabzah karna**.

The passage states: ""...yeah francisi log they jinhon nay 1940 mein germani key saath aman qayem kiya thaa aur hamlah aawaron say ladnay kee bajaye unn key saath mill kirr kam kiya.""  This clearly identifies the Vichy French as the ones who collaborated with the invaders (Germans).
"
Operation Dragoon mein shaamil ittehaadi kon thay?,"The correct answer is **A: Ameriki aur aazad fransisi** (American and Free French).

The passage clearly states: ""Sirf do hafton mein ameriki aur azad francisi afwaj nay jonubi france ko azad karaa lia..."" (In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France...)

"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kisney moahedah ki khelaaf warzi ki thee? ","The correct answer is **D: Soviet key log**.

*   **D: Eek moahedah ki khelaaf warzi** - Paragraph mein zikr hai ke Surkh fouj ne mutaddad muahidon ki khelaaf warzi ki.

Isliye, sahi jawab hai: **C: Pul key sirey parr dobarah monazzam honaa**

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Konsi darjah zail taknik Tibet key moraqbah ka ahem hissah nahein hay?","The passage states that Tibetan meditation (moraqabe) focuses on ""devta yuga"" (deity yoga), which involves visualizing different deities to cleanse energy channels, activate chakras, and generate enlightened consciousness. It also mentions that Kundalini yoga, which involves techniques like breathwork (saans ki mashq) and mantras, is part of Tibetan Buddhism, but *not* the central focus of meditation itself.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **D: Yoga ki harakaat mein maharat haasil karna (Mastering yoga postures)**

While Kundalini yoga is mentioned in the passage, the emphasis of Tibetan Moraqba, as described, is on Deity Yoga (visualization of deities). The other options, breathwork (Saans leney ki warzishein karnaa), repeating mantras (Mantaron ko dohrana) and visualizing deities (Dewtaon ko tasavvur mein lana), are either mentioned directly as part of Tibetan Buddhism/yoga or are a direct component of Deity Yoga (Dewtaon ko tasavvur mein lana).
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Tibet key moraqbah key “markaz” key doraan chakra kaisey faal huey?","The correct answer is **B: Dewtaon ko tasavvur mein lakar**.

The passage states: ""Tibbati moraqabe kaa markazi noqtah devta yuga hay. mukhtalif dewataon key tasavvur say tawanayi key channels saaf hojatay hain, chakkar mutaharrik hojatay hain...""
"
Program key doraan doosra aqeedat mandanah gaana kisney pesh kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Jai Shankar Choudhary**

The passage states: ""Gulukaar sanju sharma nay shaam kaa aaghaz kiya aur uss key baad jay shankar choudhari nay chhappan bhoj bhajan bhee gaya...""  This clearly indicates that Jai Shankar Choudhary sang after Sanju Sharma. Since Sanju Sharma started the evening, Jai Shankar Choudhary sang the second devotional song.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, khana chadhaney key doraan kisney aqeedat mandanah gaana pesh kiya thaa?","The passage states that Jai Shankar Choudhary sang ""Chhappan Bhoj Bhajan"". The passage also mentions Lakha Singh sang bhajan during the ""Chhappan Bhog"" offering.

Therefore, the correct answer is either **A: Lakkha Singh** or **B: Jai Shankar Choudhary**.

However, considering the question is about ""Khana chadhaney key doraan"" (during the food offering) and Lakha Singh specifically sang the Chhappan Bhog Bhajan during the offering of the 108 plates of Chhappan Bhog, **A: Lakkha Singh** is the more accurate answer.
"
Shaam ki dusri aakhiri kaar kardagi kiya thee?,"The correct answer is **A: Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina aur Haris Alexiou**

The passage states: ""Turki sahirah season akso nay atalvi tenor alisandro safinah aur yunani gulukaar haaris aliziyao key saath apnay funn kaa muzahirah kiya."" This directly translates to ""Turkish singer Sezen Aksu demonstrated her art with Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou."" And this performance is just before the final performance of Fire of Anatolia."
Alessandro Safina ki qomiyat kiya hay?,"The passage states: ""Turki sahirah season akso nay atalvi tenor alisandro safinah aur yunani gulukaar haaris aliziyao key saath apnay funn kaa muzahirah kiya.""

This clearly mentions Alessandro Safina as an ""atalvi tenor,"" which means Italian tenor.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **D: Italy**"
"Ebarat ki buniyaat parr, konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sahi nahein hay?","Sahi jawab hai:

**A: Santa Clara mein aag lagi thee**

Ebarat mein kahin bhi Santa Clara mein aag lagne ka zikr nahi hai. Baaki tamam options ebarat mein bataye gaye hain:

*   **C:** Mosaafiron ko paani diya gaya thaa (Ebarat ki pehli line mein likha hai)
*   **D:** Sawari sey pahley shakhs ko utarney mein kam sey kam 60 minat lagey they (Ebarat mein likha hai keh pehle shakhs ko utaarnay mein kam az kam eek ghantah lagaa thaa)"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, bechain kaney waali garmi ki satah key baarey mein kisney tabsarah kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **B: Aag ka kaptaan** (Fire captain).

The passage explicitly states that Fire Captain Scot Konas commented on the heat and the uncomfortable situation of being stuck on the roller coaster in 90-degree Fahrenheit heat.

The passage states: ""Tonga mein koyee badaa noqsan yaa chot kee khabar nahein aayi lekin aarizi tor parr bijli chalee gayee thee..."" which translates to ""There was no report of major damage or injury in Tonga, but there was a temporary power outage...""

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Niue** - The passage only mentions sonami activity near Niue but doesn't mention any power outage.
*   **C: Hawaii key school** - The passage states that schools in Hawaii were closed, but it doesn't mention any power outages there.
*   **D: Pago Pago** - The passage mentions sonami activity near Pago Pago but doesn't mention any power outage there."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Tonga parr taaqat ki gair faaliyat ka kaisey asar hua thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Hukkam motalliqah tanbihaat wosul karney key qaabil nahein thay.**

The passage states that due to a temporary power outage in Tonga, the officials were unable to receive the tsunami warning issued by PTWC. This directly corresponds to option D.

"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, New Zealand police key liye Jonny Reid ki raftaar ka andazah lgana mushkil keon thaa?","The correct answer is:

**The correct answer is not provided in the options.**

**Explanation**

According to the passage, the police had trouble determining Jonny Reid's speed because:

*   **The Black Beauty car was so low to the ground** (yeh jaannay mein preshani hoyee keh mister red kitni teezi say chal rehaa hay keunkeh black beauty kitni kam hay) that their speed radar guns had difficulty getting a reading.

Of the options provided, **none** directly address why the police had trouble gauging Jonny Reid's speed. The closest answer would be the fact the car was so low that police were unable to gauge his speed correctly and so there is not correct answer in the options."
Butte key talluq sey zalzalah ka markaz kahaan thaa?,"Correct Answer: B: 40 meel jonub

The passage states: ""Zalzalay kaa markaz... beaut say taqriban 65 kelometer (40 meel) jonub thaa."" (""The epicenter of the earthquake... was approximately 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of Butte."")
"
Abu Ghraib mein fasaad key doraan kiya hua thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Jail mein aag laga di gayi thee (The jail was set on fire)**.

The passage states directly that the Abu Ghraib jail was set on fire during riots. While the other options are related to Abu Ghraib, they don't directly answer the question of what happened *during* the riots.
"
Iraqi jail ko badnami keon mili thee? ,"The correct answer is **D: Qaidi ki badsoluki ki daryaaft (Discovery of prisoner abuse)**

The passage clearly states that Abu Ghraib jail became infamous *after* American forces took control and prisoner abuse was discovered. Options A, B, and C are facts related to the jail but not the direct reason for its infamy.
"
Maui key jang key yaadgari Stadium mein kis qism ki taqreeb muaqid honi thee?,"Correct answer:

C: Mahfil (Concert/Show)

The passage clearly states ""Band nay maawi key war memorial stadium key show ko mansukh kardiya..."" which translates to ""The band cancelled the show at Maui's War Memorial Stadium..."" This indicates that the event was a concert or show.
"
Taqreeb ki mansukhi key baarey mein kisney aakhir kar wazahat faraham ki thee?,"The correct answer is **B: Bando bast company**.

The passage states that ""Bands kee intezami company, ech key mangement incorporation, nay koyee ibtadayi wajah nahein batayi...magar unhon nay aglay din tak mantiqi wajuhaat ko elzaam diyaa."" This indicates that the management company (bandobast company) ultimately provided the explanation for the cancellation.
"

"
Jonub key mozahereen parr loot karney ka kisney ilzaam lagaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Bishkek key bashindagaan**.

The passage states that ""Bashkeek key mutaddid shahriyon nay iss laqanoniyat keliye jonub key muzahireen ko zimmah daar thehraya hay"" which translates to ""Numerous citizens of Bishkek blamed the southern protesters for this lawlessness.""
"
Ring mein badhi hui kharidon ka tajarbah kabb hua thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Shark Tank parr zahir honay key baad**.

The passage states: ""Seminof nay kahaa keh uss key 2013 kee shark tank waali qist mein zahir honey key baad farokhat mein izafah huwa..."" (Seminof said that after appearing on the Shark Tank episode in 2013, sales increased).
"
Jamie Siminoff ney Ring shurru karney ka kabb faisalah kiya thaa?,"The passage states: ""Jamie Siminoff nay tabsarah kiya thaa keh company uss waqat shuroo kee gayee thee jab inn key darwazay kee ghanti inn kee dukaan say gairege mein nahein sunayi deti thee.""

This translates to: ""Jamie Siminoff commented that the company was started when their doorbell couldn't be heard from the shop to the garage.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Apneu darwazah ki ghanti ko nakaafi samajhney key baad** (After finding his doorbell inadequate)."
Motaleaah key qose qazah key har episode mein kiss cheez keliye bachon ki sifarishaat ki pesh kash thee?,"The correct answer is **D: Kitabein (Books)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Harr programme unn kitaabon kee sifarish bhee karta hay jinhein bachon ko library mein jaatay waqt talaash karnaa chahiye."" This translates to ""Each program also recommends books that children should look for when going to the library.""
"
Motaleaah key qose qazah key silsiley ki mansukhi mein kis sey taawun mila hoga?,"The correct answer is **A: Nakaafi fund haasil karnaa**

The passage states: ""Baaz log basohmool john grant key iss key qayel hain keh funding kaa fuqdan aur educational tea wee programming key falsafah kaa taqllub donon nay iss series key inqetaa mein hissah lia.""

This directly translates to: ""Some people, including John Grant, believe that the lack of funding and the change in the philosophy of educational TV programming both contributed to the end of the series.""

Therefore, insufficient funding (Nakaafi fund haasil karnaa) is a stated reason for the show's cancellation.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon darakht key baarey mein Amsterdam aur museum keliye afsaraan ney dalil de thee?,"Correct answer is: **D: Yeah awaami sehat keliye khatrah hay** (This is a threat to public health)

The passage clearly states that Amsterdam city officials and the Anne Frank Museum officials say that the tree poses a threat to public health (""sehate aammah kos khatra lahiq ho gayaa hay""). The reason for this threat is because of the fungus and the risk of the tree falling. While the other options are true (the tree is contaminated with fungus and could fall), the *reason* the officials wanted to cut it down was specifically due to the risk to public health.
"
"RSPCA key liye eek chief tahqiq kaar key motabiq, tahqiqaat ko darjah zail mein sey kiskey liye meyaari hona chahiye?","The correct answer is **B: Janwaron key saath kaam krney waala koyi shakhs**.

Here's why:

* The quote from David O'Shannessy (the RSPCA's chief inspector) states that CCTV cameras would ""signal to individuals working with animals that animal welfare is a high priority."" This indicates that the standard for investigation/scrutiny should be those working with animals.

The other options are not the primary focus:

*   **A: CCTV camerey:** CCTV cameras are a tool, not the subject of the standard.
*   **C: Nigraani ki tansibaat:** Monitoring installations are also a tool, not the focus of the standard.
*   **D: Mazbah khaney:** Slaughterhouses are the location, but the standard applies to the *people* working there.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Australia key mazbah khanah key molazmeen keliye janwar ki bhalayi ki ahmiyat ko kiya thos bana sakti hay?","Sahi jawab hai: **A: CCTV camerey ki tansib**

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, jabb deegar giraftaari key baarey mein khabar fail rahi thee, to kitney motassireen ki akhiri rosumaat munaqid ki jaa rahi tee?","The passage states: ""P: Aaj yeah khabar red leak community mein phail gayee keh jaif vice aur unn nau mazlumin mein say teenon kee aakhri rosumaat kee adayegi ke waqt...""

This translates to: ""P: Today the news spread in the red leak community that during the last rites of Jaif Vice and three out of those nine victims...""

Therefore, the last rites were being performed for Jaif Vice and *three* other victims. So there were four sets of last rites being held at that time. However, the question specifically asks about ""deegar giraftaari key baarey mein khabar fail rahi thee, to kitney motassireen ki akhiri rosumaat munaqid ki jaa rahi tee?"" which translates to ""When the news was spreading about the additional arrest, how many victims last rites were being held"". The relevant portion is ""unn nau mazlumin mein say teenon kee aakhri rosumaat kee adayegi ke waqt"" meaning 3 out of 9 victims.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Teen**.
"

"
iPod key ziyadah garma honay key hadsaat key natijah mein kitney log zakhmi huey thay?,"The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The passage states that ""chaar log thoday jalay"" which translates to ""four people were slightly burned."" This directly answers the question of how many people were injured due to the overheating incidents.
"
Kisney kaha thaa kehh ziyadah garam honey key hadsaat bahut sanjeedah nahein thay?,"The correct answer is **D: Seeb (Apple)**.

The passage states that ""em ayee tea aayi nay elaan kiya keh apple nay usay overheating yani ziyadah garmi key 34 waaqiaat say aagah kiya thaa, jisay company nay """"gair sanjidah"""" qaraar diyaa."" This means that Apple reported the overheating incidents but considered them ""not serious"".

"
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner ney Argentinaa key cenima hall mein kiya elaan kiya thaa?,"Sahi jawab hai: **A: Apni sadarti ummidwari**

Kyunki passage mein saaf likha hai ki ""Mrs Kirchner nay sadarat key liye khadi honey kaa elaan Argentine theater say kiya.""
"
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner ney ladney key paney iraadah ka kahaan elaan kiyaa thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Buenos Aires key La Plata theatre mein**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Mrs kachner nay sadarat key liye khadi honey kaa elaan argentine theater say kiya.""

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Balke key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah durust nahein hay?","The correct answer is **B: Usney hamlah ka eteraaf kar liya thaa**.

The text explicitly states that the person in question *denied* the assault. The other options are all supported by the text:

*   **A: Wohh manzar parr giraftaar kar liya gaya thaa** - The text says he was arrested at the scene.
*   **C: Hamlah key doraan usney eek pole ka istemaal kiya thaa** - The text mentions he used a pool cue.
*   **D: Uska dawaa thaa kehh uskey ooper botalein fenki gayi theen** - The text indicates he claimed he was using the pool cue to defend himself from bottles.
"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail mein sey kiya Blake key saath waqea nahein hua thaa?","Sahi jawab hai **C: Uss parr eek pole sey hamlah hua thaa**.

Explanation:

*   The passage says Black *used* a pool cue (pole) to defend himself from bottles being thrown at him. It does not say he was attacked with a pole.

The other options are all true based on the passage:

*   A: The passage states he was accused of perverting the course of justice.
*   B: The passage states he was arrested at the scene.
*   D: The passage states the judge told him imprisonment was ""almost inevitable.""
"
U.N. ka aalami tapish ka fund kiskey liye istemaal nahein hogaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Mamalik ko taraqqi deney key liye taknik lanaa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically mentions the fund will be used for:

    *   Flood-proof housing
    *   Improved water systems
    *   Crop diversification

*   While the passage does mention sharing technologies with developing countries for low-pollution development, this is presented as a separate agenda item, *not* as a direct use of the global warming fund itself.

*   Option D is very broad but technically covered in that Flood Proof makanaat and aab rasaani key behatar nizam would assist in taking measures against the adverse effects of global warming.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, U.N. ko keya mahfooz karney ki ummid hay?","The correct answer is **A: Paisah, Taknik key ishteraak key zariyah**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the UN hopes to finalize a fund to help countries affected by global warming. This means the UN hopes to secure **Paisah** (money).
*   The passage also mentions sharing technologies with developing countries for low-pollution development, which is **Taknik key ishteraak** (sharing technology).
*   While the passage mentions protecting forests (C), it is not something U.N. is trying to secure. it is included in the agenda.
*   The passage doesn't directly say the UN is hoping to secure crops (B) or affected people by poor water arrangements (D).
*   It rather specifies crops will be part of the fund that is generated (D).

Therefore, option A is the most accurate based on the information in the passage."
Darjah zail mein sey kiska Albert Muchanga ney kisi aisi cheez key tor parr hawalah nahein diya thaa jiss parr abb bhi ittefaaq karney ki zarurat hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Jis tarikh ko tejaarat shuru ho sakti hay.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: """"ham abhi tak asl qanoon aur mahsulaat kee moraat parr muttafiq nahein hoay hain..."""". This directly indicates that Albert Muchanga referred to the **asal qawayed** (original rules) and **tariff ki reaayatein** (tariff concessions) as things that still needed agreement.
*   The passage also mentions """"Au tejarat aur sanaati commisioner albert mochanga nay benan kee shomooliyat kaa elaan kiya thaa"""", meaning that the fact that **Aya Benin AfCTA mein shaamil hogaa** (Benin would join AfCFTA) has been already announced by him, thus agreed upon.
*   Lastly, the commissioner said, """"jo bunyaadi dhancha hamare paas mojud hay woh 1 july 2020 say tejarat shuroo karnay keliye kaafi hay"""" and therefore, the **Jis tarikh ko tejaarat shuru ho sakti hay** (date when trade can start) is not something still needing agreement."
Ebarat key hisaab sey tejarat July mein keon shuru ho sakti hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Maqaam mein qawayed aur reaayaton ka kaafi framework hota hay.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""jo bunyaadi dhancha hamare paas mojud hay woh 1 july 2020 say tejarat shuroo karnay keliye kaafi hay"" which translates to: ""The basic structure we have in place is sufficient to start trading from 1 July 2020."" ""B"" conveys this idea that a sufficient framework of rules and concessions exists.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: July ki tarikhe aaghaz AfCFTA mein shaamil honey key liye Nigeria ki sharayet ka eek hissah hay:** The passage doesn't explicitly say that the July start date is *required* for Nigeria's accession. It just mentions Nigeria planned to join and start trading by that date.
*   **C: Isko AU key tejarat aur sanaati commissioner ney thik qaraar diya thaa:** While the commissioner made the statement, the *reason* trade can start is because of the framework, not just the commissioner's approval.
*   **D: Asal qawayed aur tariff ki reaayaton parr ittefaaq kiya gaya hay:** The passage *explicitly states* that they have *not* yet agreed on the rules of origin and tariff concessions (""ham abhi tak asl qanoon aur mahsulaat kee moraat parr muttafiq nahein hoay hain""). This directly contradicts option D.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Atlanta Journal-ka dastur taleemi afsaraan parr kis cheez ka ilzaam lagay thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Suraagh shudah andruni masail key tor parr kaam na karna**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's report ""alleged that internally the school had become aware of problems but they did not take any action on those facts."" This directly translates to failing to act on identified internal problems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Journal-dastur ki report key saath ched chaad karnaa:** The passage says *test papers* were tampered with, not the Journal-Constitution's report. Also, it was the educator who tampered with the test and not the other way around.

*   **B: Shahri taleem ki ikhteraa karney mein nakaam hona:** The passage mentions that the educator was recognized for innovation in urban education, so they were not accused of failing to innovate.

*   **D: Kam jaanch key score ki report karnaa:** The passage suggests *high* test scores were reported, but were potentially manipulated. The accusation is about *how* the scores were achieved, not that they reported low scores."
"Ebarat mein di gayi maalumaat ki buniyaad parr, Atlanta Journal-key dastur ki report mein kiya mazkoor nahein thaa?","The correct answer is **C: 2013 ka saal ka qomi Superintendent jeetney waala** (The 2013 National Superintendent of the Year winner).

Here's why:

*   **A: Gair mamuli jaanch key score ki behtari** (Unusual improvements in test scores) - The passage explicitly states that the report highlighted the ""unusual pace of improvement in test scores.""
*   **B: Yeah shahadat kehh jaanch key kaghzaat key saath ched chaad ki gayi thee** (Evidence that test papers had been tampered with) - While the report itself might not have directly *proved* tampering, the passage says it ""alleged that the school at an internal level was aware of the problems but took no action on those facts."" The subsequent evidence (mentioned later in the passage) confirmed the tampering, so the report raised serious concerns about the integrity of the test results.
*   **D: Shahri taleem ki ikhteraa karney ki tajaaveez** (Proposals to innovate urban education) - The first sentence mentions that the superintendent's identity was ""acknowledged for his innovative urban education."" This implies his ideas and proposals were part of the discussion and his recognition.
*   **C: 2013 ka saal ka qomi Superintendent jeetney waala** (The 2013 National Superintendent of the Year winner) - The passage does not explicitly mentioned who won the award in 2013, but the superintendent who had won the national award in 2009.

Therefore, option C is something that the report did not mention."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, bab baari key baad kiya malumaat mashhoor thee?","The correct answer is **B: KInn imaaraton key paas bam phatey thay**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions ""sarkari emaraton key qareeb mazeed teen bom dhamakay hoay."" This translates to ""near government buildings, three more bomb blasts occurred."" This provides information about where the bombs detonated.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Akhiri zakhm ka shumaar:** The passage explicitly states ""hatmi aadaad wo shumaar kaa abhi tak ilm nahein huwa hay,"" meaning the final numbers are not yet known. So, the definitive wounded count wasn't public.
*   **C: Aya ezaafi bam shaamil honay thay:** The passage doesn't state whether additional bombs would be involved. It only details the bomb detonations that already occurred.
*   **D: Maut ki sarkaari tadaad:** The passage says ""Kuchh reports mein sarkari amwaat kee sharah aath batayi gayee hay, aur sarkari report nay 30 key zakhmi honey kee tasdiq kee hay,"" indicating there were conflicting reports about fatalities and the official number was uncertain at the time.

Therefore, only option B is specifically mentioned as information known after the initial blast."
"2017 mein Manchester shahar sey judney key baad sey, Jesus ney kitney match kheley thay?","The correct answer is **D: 53**

The passage states: ""Uss waqt say, yeah brazili khiladi tamaam muqabilon mein club keliye 53 match khel chukay hain..."" which translates to: ""Since then, this Brazilian player has played 53 matches for the club in all competitions...""
"
Kiss club sey judney key liye Jesus ney £27 million fees wosul ki thee?,"The correct answer is **B: Manchester shahar (Manchester City)**.

The passage states that Gabriel Jesus joined Manchester City for a reported fee of £27 million. Therefore, Manchester City is the club that Jesus joined for that fee.
"
Hostel key mehmaanon key liye konsa bayaan sahi nahein hay?,"Sahi jawab hai **D: Aksar mehmaan moqaddas shahar sey thay**.

P text ke mutabiq, hostel key ziyada tar mehmaan Muttaheda Arab Emaraat key shahri they, isliye ye bayan sahi nahi hai keh aksar mehmaan muqaddas shahar (Makkah) sey they.

A, B, aur C teeno bayanat P text mein di gayi malumat ke mutabiq sahi hain.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail konsa bayaniyah sahi hay?","The correct answer is **B: Tamaam mehmaan muttahedah arab imaraat sey thay**.

Here's why:

*   **P:** ""Hostel key mehmanon mein ziyadah tar muttahedah arab emaraat key shahri shaamil they."" (The majority of the hostel guests were citizens of the United Arab Emirates)

Therefore, the statement aligns with the provided text.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A:** The passage states that at least 15 deaths occurred.
*   **C:** The passage doesn't mention the first night of Hajj.
*   **D:** The passage specifies that most of the guests were from the United Arab Emirates, not local to Makkah."
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, tasaadum key baarey mein konsi malumaat yaqini nahein hay?","The correct answer is **C: Zameen parr tasaadum ka asar**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Tasaadum ki size:** The passage explicitly states that ""Sciencedan kehtay hain keh tasadum key baes honey waala dhamaka bahut badaa thaa"" which means the size of the collision was big.

*   **B: Tasaadum ki jagah:** The passage says ""khlaa mein 491 meel oper takra gaye"" - meaning it happened 491 miles up in space.

*   **C: Zameen parr tasaadum ka asar:** The passage states, ""woh log abb bhee iss baat kaa tayyun karnay kee koshish karr rahay hain yeah takkar kitni tez thee aur iss key zameen parr kiss tarah asar hoga."" This directly indicates that the impact on Earth is *not* yet known.

*   **D: Khandaraat ki jagah:** The passage states, ""Ameriki mohkamah defaa key daftar kaa ameriki strategic command malbah talaash karr rahaa hay,"" indicating they are searching for the debris. While the exact location isn't given, the search itself confirms it's being investigated."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, tasadum key baarey mein kis cheez ko motayyan hona zaruri hay?","The correct answer is **D: Takkar ka durust paimanah**.

The passage explicitly states that scientists are still trying to determine ""yeah takkar kitni tez thee aur iss key zameen parr kiss tarah asar hoga."" This means they are trying to determine the precise scale/magnitude of the collision.

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Khandaraat ki suraagh rasani ko kaun sanbhale gaa:** The passage states US Strategic Command is searching for debris, so we already know who is handling that.
*   **B: Tasadum key waqt satellites kitni tezi sey safar kar rahi theen:** The speed of the satellites is already given in the passage, approximately 17,500 miles per hour.
*   **C: Kaisy saazish key tajziyaati natayej ka ishteraak kiya jaaye gaa:** The passage mentions that results of the debris analysis will be put on a public website, so the method of sharing is already established."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Batten ney maldaar tareen amerikiyon ki fihrist mein kabhi konsey maqaam ka haamil thaa?","The correct answer is **C: 190vein**.

The passage states that Beaton was number 190 on the list of 400 richest Americans.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko Batten ney atiyah kiya thaa?,"Correct Answer: B: Virginia ki University

Explanation:
Paragraph P clearly states that Beaton (spelling in the question is slightly different but it's likely the same person) was ""one of the university of Virginia's distinguished benefactors"". So the answer is clearly Virginia ki University."
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger ki dastakhat shudah bill ka kiya cheez hissah nahein hay?,"Sahi jawab hai **C: California key baahar nabalighon ko pur tashaddud video games ki frokht yaa kerayah parr pabandi**.

Di gayi statement mein sirf California mein chhote bachon ko pur tashaddud video game farokht karnay parr pabandi kaa zikr hay, California key baahar nahi."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss sey kahi janey waali batein choot gayi theen","Correct answer is **D: Duvall**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Miller didn't really hear what ""woh (he/she)"" was saying.
*   Miller's statement about the microphone and preparing indicates he wasn't paying attention to the person speaking during the hearing.
*   The beginning of the passage refers to the children of **Duvall** and also mentions that the story was ""regarding him"". Therefore, **Duvall** is the person who the story is about, and who Miller was too distracted to listen to at the trial.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Duvall's children** - The passage doesn't say anything about the children speaking at the hearing.
*   **B: Mike** - ""Mike"" is mentioned in Miller's statement, but the sentence references what ""the mike"" was doing, not that an actual person name ""Mike"" was speaking
*   **C: Miller** - The passage quotes Miller, so obviously he didn't miss his own statements."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, sunaney parr Miller key tajarbah key baarey mein darjah zail mein sey kiya sahi nahein hay?","The correct answer is **D: Duvall ki kahani parr wohh gahri tawajjoh dey rahey thay**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Miller was preparing and ""didn't really listen"" to what was being said. This directly contradicts option D, which says he was paying deep attention.

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with the passage:

*   A: Sunaney key doraan Miller parr Duvall ney tassur dala thaa - The passage indicates that the situation surrounding Duvall (her two children's father being married) did not deeply affect Miller.
*   B: Tayyar hotey waqt woh tawajjoh nahein dey rahaa thaa - Miller himself admits he was getting ready and not paying attention.
*   C: Snaney key waqt Duvall key do bachon ney bahut baat ki thee - Miller mentions ""the mic talks too much during the hearing."" This is a strong indication that there was excessive talking happening during the hearing. While it doesn't explicitly say Duvall's children were the sole cause, the first part of the question suggests that their father's marital status was the focus of Duvall's story.

Therefore, option D is the only one that is not consistent with the information provided in the passage."
Kisney tajweez di thee kehh ‘Saaf Hawa ka Qanoon’ mein nazre saaniyaan karni hongi?,"The correct answer is **C: Jack Layton**.

The passage states that Jack Layton demanded that the ""clean air act"" be completely rewritten. This implies he was the one who suggested revisions to the bill."
Kisney iss baat sey inkaar kiya thaa kehh ‘Saaf Hawa ka Qanoon’ ka istemaal election sey pahley ki baazi key tor parr kiya jaa raha thaa?,"Correct answer is **B: Eek wazeere aazam**.

The passage states that Prime Minister John Howard defended the federal government's decision to fund the hospital, saying it was to protect hospital facilities from decline. This implies that he denied the move was a pre-election ploy."
Morakkabaat cyanuric acid aur melamine uss waqt kiya tashkil diya thaa jabb unhoney billi key peshaab mein eek deegar key saath radde amal kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Billor (Crystals)**.

The passage clearly states that cyanuric acid and melamine combine to form crystals (""cristal tashkil detay hain"") when mixed, particularly in the context of cat urine. The rest of the options are not formed by the combination of these two compounds.
"
Tahqiq kaaron ney infrared spectroscopy ka istemaal kiss cheez ka moshahedah karney key liye kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Paltu janwar key peshaab mein billori morakkab**.

The passage states that researchers used infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to compare the crystal compounds formed with melamine and cyanuric acid in cat urine to the crystals found in the urine of the sick pets. This comparison was done to observe the crystalline compound in the pet urine.
"
Kisney Luna ko “Intehaa pasand ki malekah” kaha thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The passage states: ""Tommy dreamer nay kahaa hay keh, lona extreme kee pehli raani."" (Tommy Dreamer said that Luna was the first queen of extreme.)
"
Kisney Luna ko “Ajeeb” kaha thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Dustin Runnels**.

The passage states: ""Distin goldist"""" raneels nay tabsarah kartay hoay kahaa keh """"lona meeri tarah shoqeen thee...shayed mujh say bhee ziyadah..""

While the question asks who called Luna ""Ajeeb"", the closest translation in the passage is ""shoqeen"", which can mean quirky or eccentric. Dustin Runnels is the one who described her this way.
"
Takkar mein shaamil driver key saath kiya nahein hua thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Usey Cambridge key haspataal sey Great Yarmouth key eek haspataal mien muntaqil kiya gaya thaa**.

The passage states the opposite: The driver was initially taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth and *later* transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. So, option C is what *did not* happen to the driver.
"
Rugby tournament key doraan jonubi Africa key gameplay key baarey mein khadi kiya cheez nahein thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Tournament key aaghaz mein eek polish kardah kaar kardagi (A polished performance at the start of the tournament)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Khel mein jonubi afriqah apni jonubi behnon key khelaaf intehayi kamzor lag rahee theen..."" which translates to ""In the match, South Africa was looking extremely weak against their southern sisters..."". This directly contradicts the idea of a polished performance at the beginning of the tournament.
*   The passage explicitly mentions ""unn key manazzam defaa, ball handling kee maharat aur umdah team work"" indicating impressive teamwork, ball handling skills, and defensive skills, respectively."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, jonugbi Africa ka game kabb behtar hona shuru hua thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Jaisaa kehh tournament chalta gaya**.

The passage explicitly states: ""jaise jaise tournament aagay badhta gayaa karkardagi behtar hoti chalee gayee"" (as the tournament progressed, their performance kept improving).
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsa darjah zail bayaniyah Cheen ki maeeshat ki durust tor parr akkaasi nahein karta hay?","Sahi jawab **D: Cheen ney Jarmani key moqabley kabhi bhi ziyadah car baramad nahein ki hay.** hai.

Ibaarat mein wazeh tor par kaha gaya hai ke ""Pehli baar Cheen nay pichlay saal Germani say ziyadah carein export keen"". Is wajah sey, option D, jo is baat ka daawa karta hai ke Cheen nay kabhi bhi Germani say ziyadah car baramad nahein keen, durust nahin hai.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Cheen ki GDP Amerika ko kab obur kar sakti hay?","The correct answer is **B: Do dahayion mein**.

The passage states: ""Agli do dahayiyon mein america key muqabilay mein cheen kee gdp mean bahut ziyadah izafah ho sakta hay."" This translates to ""In the next two decades, China's GDP may increase much more compared to America's."" While it doesn't definitively say *when* China will surpass the US, it strongly suggests it could happen within the next two decades.
"
Hu ney taraqqi pazeer mulkon ko kiya karney ki tajweez dee thee?,"The correct answer is **D: Aaludgi key puraney raaston sey bachein (Avoid the old pollution paths)**.

The passage states: ""How nay taraqqi pazeer momalik kee yeah kehtay hoay hauslah afzayi kee keh, """"pehle aaludgi phailao aur baad mein safayi kro key rujhaan say ehteraz karein"""""" which translates to: ""How encouraged developing countries by saying, ""avoid the trend of polluting first and cleaning up later"""". This directly corresponds to option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Unn zimmah daariyon ko nibhayein jo unki taraqqi key marhalah ka moharrik ho (Fulfill the responsibilities that drive their stage of development)** While related to the idea of responsibilities, the specific encouragement was to avoid the old ""pollute first, clean later"" path, not simply to fulfill all responsibilities related to development.
*   **B: Maashi natijah parr tawajjoh dein (Focus on economic outcomes)** While economic outcome is mentioned when discussing China, it isn't the direct advice given to developing countries.
*   **C: Apni mojudah zimmah daariyon key pichey bhaagein (Run away from your current responsibilities)** This is the opposite of what How implied.
"
Hu ney kiss cheez ka zikr nahein kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Carbon key ikhraaj ki katautiyon ka eek aadado shumaar**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Unhon nay katoti keliye koyee aadaad wo shumaar pesh nahein kiya..."" (He did not present any figures or numbers for the reduction...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Katautiyon ki buniyaad (Basis of the reductions):** The passage mentions the basis of the reduction: ""cheen kee iqtesadi natijah kee bunyaad parr kam karein gay"" (based on China's economic performance).
*   **B: Aaludgi key motalliq taraqqi pazeer mulkon ko mashwarah dein (Giving advice to developing countries regarding pollution):** The passage quotes Hu advising developing countries to ""pehle aaludgi phailao aur baad mein safayi kro key rujhaan say ehteraz karein"" (avoid the trend of polluting first and cleaning up later).
*   **C: Jiss tarikh tak carbon key ikhrajaat ki ummid hay kehh katauti ho jaye gee (The date by which carbon emissions are expected to be reduced):** The passage mentions the year 2020 as a target date: ""ham 2005 kee satah say 2020 tak qaabil zikr satah tak gdp key fee unit carbon dyoxide mein katoti kee koshish karein gay."" (We will try to reduce carbon dioxide per unit of GDP to a significant level from the 2005 level to 2020.)"
Darjah zail mein sey kiskey liye Veerman ney kaha thaa kehh haalat achhi nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

The passage states: ""Angolah bemari key apnay sab say badtareen phailao kee taraf gamzan hay aur angolah mein suratehaal bahut kharab hay"" (Angola is moving towards its worst outbreak of disease and the situation in Angola is very bad). Richard Veerman said this.
"
"Moqaddamah chalney ki wajah sey, Huhne ki kabinah ka uhdah kon legaa?","Correct answer is **A: Davey**

The passage states: ""Hohan nay isteefa day diyaa hay aur uss kee jagah kabinah mein rukn parliament aid devi lay gaa."" (Huhne has resigned and will be replaced in the cabinet by MP Ed Davey).
"
Moqaddamah key baad tejarati wazeer key kirdaar ko kaun sanbhaley gaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Lamb**.

The passage states: ""Twaqqo kee jaarahi hay keh rukn parliament norman lamb wazir tejarat hongay..."" which translates to ""It is expected that Member of Parliament Norman Lamb will be the Minister of Trade...""
"
Kaar kardagi karney waley nazreen ki Camille Saint-Saens key opera key doraan kiya karney key liye hausalah afzaayi kartey hein?,"The correct answer is A:

*   **Original Text (Translated):** ""Chemile cent- siens key zariah french apera mein pesh kee gayee kahaani eek aise fankaar parr mabni hay """"jinn kee zindagi manshiyaat aur japan say mohabbat keliye waqf hoti hay."""" Natijah key tor parr adakaron nay mushtarkah tor parr stage parhashish pie, aur theater bazaat khud saameyin ko uss mein shareek honay kee hauslah afzayi kartay nazar aaya.""
    *   Translation: ""The story presented in the French opera through Camille Saint-Saens is based on an artist whose life is devoted to drugs and love for Japan. As a result, the actors collectively smoked hashish on stage, and the theater itself seemed to encourage the audience to participate in it.""
*   **Question (Translated):** ""What were performers encouraging the audience to do during the Camille Saint-Saens opera?""

Option A, ""Bhang key istemaal mein hissah lenaa"" (Participate in hashish use), directly reflects the translated text, which states that the actors smoked hashish and the theater encouraged the audience to participate."
Opera key doraan buniyadi tor parr kon mushtarekah smoking karta hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Kaar kardagi karney waaley**.

The passage states that ""adakaron nay mushtarkah tor parr stage parhashish pie,"" which translates to ""the actors collectively smoked hashish on stage."" ""Kaar kardagi karney waaley"" means ""performers,"" which is a synonym for ""actors"" in this context.
"
Leonov key anjaam deney waaley “waqfah chalan” key liye eek deegar naam kiya hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Cosmonaut No. 11**

The passage states: ""Lenove, jo """"cosmonaut number 11"""" key naam say bhee maruf hay...uss nay...pehli baar khalayi jehaaz say baahar aaney kee insani srgarmi (aiwa), yaa """"khalaa mein chalna"""" anjaam di."" This clearly connects the nickname ""Cosmonaut No. 11"" with his spacewalk.
"
Leonov ney Soviet key kiss mission key hissah ki qeadat ki thee?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**.

The passage states: ""Das saal baad, unhon nay apolo- swewz mission key soviet hissay kee qeyadat kee..."" which translates to ""Ten years later, he led the Soviet part of the Apollo-Soyuz mission...""
"
Takkar mein kon zakhmi hua thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Gibson**.

The passage states that Gibson was taken to the hospital after the accident but died shortly after. The truck driver was not injured. The children were witnesses but not mentioned as injured.
"
Haadsah mein shaamil logon key saath kiya hua thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Eek zakhmi hua tha, eek mar gaya thaa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""Gibson ko eek hospital tak pahunchaya gayaa magar woh kuch der baad hee margaya"" (Gibson was taken to a hospital but died shortly after). This means someone died.
*   It also says ""64 salah truck driver ko uss tasadum key doraan koyee chot nahein aayi thee"" (The 64-year-old truck driver was not injured in the collision). This implies that only Gibson was injured and then died.
*   The children (Bachay) that where waiting to cross the road were not involved in the accident, they only watched the accident happen.

"
Progaram parr kaam kar rahey saensadaan darjah zail mein sey kiskey sabab honay waley asaraat ka moshahedah kaney ki ummid kar rahey thay?,"The correct answer is **B: Samundari taqatein (Samundari taaqatain)**, which translates to ""Tidal Forces.""

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the scientists were looking for effects ""caused by tidal effects between the dark matter of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.""  The analogy to the moon's gravity causing tides on Earth directly links the desired observation to tidal forces.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Baqaedah moamilah (Regular Matter):** While regular matter plays a role, the focus is on the interaction of *dark* matter.
*   **C: Chotey zarraat (Small Particles):** Although the passage mentions dark matter being composed of small particles, the *effect* they were trying to observe was not the particles themselves, but the tidal forces resulting from their interaction.
*   **D: Tareek moamilah (Dark Matter):** Dark matter is the *source* of the tidal forces, not the effect being observed.

**B: Tameere nav key koshish ki kami**"
Hurricane Katrina ki raahat koshishon keliye tameere nav key moahedaat ki kon tanqid kar rahaa thaa?,"The passage states:

*   ""baaz maaliyaati qadamat pasandon nay mezahan """"bush kee new arlens deal"""" kaa unwaan diyaa"" - Some financial conservatives sarcastically called it ""Bush's New Orleans Deal.""
*   ""Tameer naw kee koshish parr aazadana noqtah cheeni kaa markaz washington mein basnay waale mulazimin ko tameer naw key theekay denay parr hay."" - The focus of the free criticism of the reconstruction effort is on awarding reconstruction contracts to Washington-based employees.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **A: Maali qadamat pasand (Financial Conservatives)** and **B: Aazad khiyaal (Liberals)**.
*   However, the question only allows for one choice, so pick the most relevant based on the first sentence.
*   If forced to choose the single best answer from the provided options, it would be **A: Maali qadamat pasand (Financial Conservatives)** since they're mentioned directly as being critical and giving it a nickname.

This translates to: ""Ohio authorities say a doctor working at a children's hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, will be charged with murder after her **mother** was found dead in the trunk of her car on Wednesday.""

Therefore, Doctor Malar Balasubramanian's relationship to Saroja Balasubramanian is mother.

Sara Balasubramanian ki laash kahaan mili thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Car ki diggi mein**.

The passage states: ""Vahan unhon nay 53 salah saroja balasubramanium kee lash payee jo khoon aalud kambalon say dahki hoyee thee."" and ""unn kee maan key apni car key trunk mein murdah paaye jaaney key baad budh key din qatle amad kaa elzaam aayed kiya jaye gaa.""

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon mumkanah tor parr plant key andar aur ird gird key khatarnaak halaat ka baes hua thaa?","Ebarat ke mutabiq, Japan ki nuclear agency ne plant mein radioactive caesium aur iodine ki shanakht ki hai. Hukkaam ka andaza hai ke johri eendhan wale dabbe phat gaye hain aur us se rasao ho raha hai. Is se pata chalta hai ke radioactive caesium aur iodine plant ke andar aur gird ke khatarnaak halaat ka baes bane.

Ebarat mein uranium eendhan ka zikr toh hai, lekin yeh saaf nahi hai ke wohi khatarnaak halaat ka baes bana hai. Safed dhuwaan aur iodine khud khatarnaak halaat ke natije hain, wajha nahi.

Is liye, sahi jawab hai:

**B: Radioactive caesium**

"
NextGen fazayi traffic key controll kerney walon ko barahe raast kaisey fayedah pahunchata hay?,"The question asks how NextGen directly benefits air traffic controllers. Let's analyze the passage:

*   The passage states that NextGen uses satellite-based technology, *allowing air traffic controllers to track aircraft with greater precision* and *provide pilots with more accurate information*.

Therefore, the answer is **B: Ziyadah durust hawai jahaaz key mahallaate waqoo (More precise aircraft location)**. The other options are benefits derived from this more precise location, but are not the *direct* benefit to the controllers themselves."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Moarrikhin ney kiss cheez parr tawajjo diya jaaney key liye FBI par tnaqid nahi ki hay?","The correct answer is **A: Apni kamiyaabi ki sharah ko badha chadha kar batana**

Here's why:

*   **The passage states that historians criticized the FBI for focusing on easily solvable cases (like stolen cars) to boost their success rate.**
*   **The passage also mentions Congress requiring the FBI to dedicate resources to pornography prevention.**
*   **The passage does not mention anything about historians criticizing the FBI for exaggerating their success rate.**
*   **Focusing on easy crimes (stolen cars) is a specific point of criticism.**
*   **Increased attention to pornography cases is a result of Congress mandate.**

Therefore, option A is the only one that the historians did *not* criticize the FBI for, according to the passage."
Fahhashi ki pahal FBI ko keya karney key liye majboor karti hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Fahash nigaari key cason key liye agenton ko waqf karney**

Darjah zail mein sey kon partizan belgrade key saath bobeek key career ki durust tor parr akkasi nahein karta hay?,"Correct Answer: A

Explanation:

The passage states that Bobek scored 403 goals in 468 matches for Partizan Belgrade. Option A says he scored *more* than 468 goals, which is incorrect. All other options accurately reflect information from the passage:

*   **B:** States he scored more goals than any other player for the club, which the passage explicitly says.
*   **C:** States he was once named the best player in the team's history, which the passage says happened in 1995.
*   **D:** States that he participated in more games than any other player.
"
Partizan belgrade key saath bobeek ki tarikh key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah durust nahi hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Usney 1995 tak Partizan keliye khela thaa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states Bobek played for Partizan Belgrade from 1945 to 1958. Therefore, he did not play until 1995.
*   The passage states Bobek was born in Zagreb and gained fame while playing for Partizan Belgrade.
*   The passage states Bobek was declared the best player in Partizan's history in 1995.
*   The passage states that Bobek gained fame while playing for Partizan."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsi khosusiyat Hespronex ko velocroptor sey mkhtalif banati hay?","The correct answer is **B: Iska eek ziyadah badaa dusra panjah hai**.

The passage specifically states that the larger second claw is what led to the name Hespronex, meaning ""western claw"".  While the passage mentions other characteristics like fully feathered bodies and being warm-blooded, these are shared with Velociraptors, not differences.
"
“Hespronex” ks matlab parjaatiyon ki kiss jismani khususiyat sey maakhuz hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Panjah (panjey)**.

The passage states: ""Uss kaa dosra panjah nisbatan badaa thaa, jokeh hespironex naam kee maqboliyat kaa baes banaa jis kaa matlab """"maghribi panjah"""" hota hay."" This directly translates to the other claw being relatively large, which led to the popularity of the name Hespronex, meaning ""western claw.""
"
Shoot karney key baarey mein darjah zail konsa bayaniyah sahi nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Buffalo mein eek saal pahley iss jodey ki shaadi hui thee**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the couple got married in Texas a year prior and came to Buffalo to celebrate with friends and family. This means their wedding was *not* in Buffalo.

Let's look at why the other options are likely true based on the provided text:

*   **A: Shohar aur biwi donon Texas sey thay:** The passage states they got married in Texas, implying at least one of them has ties to Texas. We can't be sure both are *from* Texas, but it's a plausible interpretation. Since the Buffalo resident came to Texas to get married, we can assume that he/she married his/her love interest of the Texas area.
*   **B: Wahan paanch motassirin they:** The passage states four people died and the wife was uninjured, the exact number of shooting victims is not stated in the text. It is not possible to know how many people were shot during the shooting.
*   **D: Shoot karaa Buffalo mein waqea hua thaa:** The passage indicates the shooting occurred in Buffalo."
Jahaan shooting hui thee wahaan ki taqrib key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah durust nahein hay?,"Correct answer is C: Yeah Texas mein eek party mein waqea hua thaa

Explanation:

The passage states that the shooting happened at a party celebrating a couple's first anniversary in Buffalo, New York. The couple got married in Texas a year prior but were celebrating their anniversary in Buffalo. So option C is incorrect.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Luno key baarey mein afsaraan key dariyaan ibtadai tashweesh kiya thee?","The correct answer is **C: Eendhan ka bahao (Fuel Spill)**

**Explanation:**

The passage states: ""ibteda mein ahal kaaron ko khadsha thaa keh jahaaz say saamaan ubal jaye gaa."" This translates to ""Initially, the crew feared that the cargo would spill from the ship."" Since the passage mentions ""160-120 cubic meter eendhan thaa jab yeah kharab ho gayaa"" (there was 160-120 cubic meters of fuel when it was damaged), the ""saamaan"" that the crew feared would spill must be referring to the fuel.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Luno ki toot key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sahi nahein hay?","The correct answer is **B: Tootney key waqt jahaaz mein 100 meter eendhan thaa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states there were **160-120 cubic meters** of fuel when the Luno broke down, not 100 meters.

Let's examine why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Samaan uthaney sey pahley toot waqea hui thee:** The passage mentions the ship was *going* to pick up fertilizer cargo, indicating the breakdown happened beforehand.
*   **C: Amalah key barahh araakin mein sey, eek zakhmi hua thaa:** The passage explicitly says one person broke their nose.
*   **D: Jahaz ko sahili rukawat mein dhakel diya gaya thaa:** The passage states that the wind and waves pushed the ship into a coastal barrier."
Kis dahaai mein Algeria ko aazadi mili thee?,"The correct answer is **C: 1960 kee dahayi** (1960s).

"
Akhiri rosumaat ki taqrib keliye television screen kahaan set up nahein hui thee?,"The correct answer is **D: St. Peter key morabbah mein**

The passage states that it was impossible for everyone to access Saint Peter's Square *in person*. Therefore, TV screens wouldn't have been needed *inside* the square to show the ceremony. The other options (Rome, Italian cities, and specific locations in Poland) all had screens set up for those who couldn't attend in person.
"
Akhiri rosum ki taqrib kahaan munaqid hui thee?,"The correct answer is **C: St. Peter key morabbah mein**.

The passage states that it was impossible for everyone to access St. Peter's Square for the funeral ceremony. This implies that the ceremony itself took place in St. Peter's Square. While large screens were set up in other locations, the actual ceremony was held there.
"
"Dhamakah key baad, sangeen zakhmon key liye kiska elaaj kiya gaya thaa?","The correct answer is **B: Koyi nahein**.

"
Konsey darhah zail khelon ko aalami Olympic Committee ney khelon mein shaamil karney key liye vote kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Rugby union**.

"
Guinness har saal taqriban kitney billion dollar lekar aata hay?,"The correct answer is **C: 14**.

It also mentions that the identification of the deadly bird flu H5N1 in humans occurred near Lyon in eastern France due to the death of a migratory wild duck. The other countries listed (Germany, Greece) are mentioned as affected earlier. While Croatia and Denmark had suspected cases, they were unconfirmed, making France the location of the confirmed case.
"
Aman key daston ki wajah sey failao sey pahley Haaiti ka aakhiri baar bimaari sey saamna kabb hua thaa?,"Sawaal mein diye gaye paragraph ke mutabiq, ""Daston kee aamad say qabal, heaty ko attharvein sadee say bemari say mutalliq masail kaa saamna nahein huwa thaa.""

Is ka matlab hai ke aman ke daston ki aamad se pehle, Haaiti ka aakhiri baar bimaari se saamna 18th Century (attharvein sadee) mein hua tha. Attarvein sadee ka matlab 1700 ka dashak hota hai.

Isliye, diye gaye options mein se, koi bhi saheeh tor parr sahih jawab ko nahin darshaata, kyonki koi bhi option 1700s nahi kah raha hai. Lekin agar hamein zyada sahih jawab chunna hai, to yeh hona chahiye:

The other options are incorrect:

*   B: Jismaani noqsaan (Physical damage): The passage explicitly states that physical damage did not occur (""Alaamat ko jismani tor parr badla nahein gayaa thaa"").
*   C: Guda gardi (Vandalism): The passage states that they are investigating trespassing and ""nah keh toad phod key baaray mein"" meaning ""not vandalism"".

"
"Nishaani ko tabdil kartey waqt, mustabah ney kiya nahein kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Jismaani tor parr usey noqsaan kar diya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Alaamat ko jismani tor parr badla nahein gayaa thaa"" which translates to ""The sign was not physically changed."" This means the suspect did not physically damage or harm the sign. The other options are either mentioned as actions the suspect *did* take, or implied to be part of their actions.

"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, kiss bandhak ki tasdiqu bator jaldi chooeney key nahein hui thee?","Sawal ke mutabiq, photographers, bacche aur boodhe, in teeno ko jaldi riha kiya gaya tha. Lekin sayyahon ke bare mein aisa koi zikr nahin hai.

Isliye sahi jawab hai:

**A: Sayyah**
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Brazil mein hamjins ki shaadi ki himaayat mein dastakhat ekattha kon kar rahaa thsaa?","The correct answer is **A: Mozahereen (Protesters)**.

The passage states that protesters hope to collect 1.2 million signatures to present to the National Congress in November regarding the issue. Therefore, they are the ones gathering signatures in support of same-sex marriage.
"
Mozahereen ney apni pettion kisko di thee,"The correct answer is **C: Brazil ki qomi Congress**.

The passage clearly states: ""Muzahireen nay ummid jatayi hay keh november mein national congress key saamney arzi dayer karnay keliye unn key paas 1.2 millin darkhwastein jamma hojayein gee.""
"
"Armand warsi key hisaab sey, bheed key mosam ka radde amal shuru karney sey pahley kiya hua thaa?","Let's break down the timeline from the passage:

1. **""Display mein paanch mint dekhnay key baad hawa andar daakhil honey lagi""** - After watching the display for 5 minutes, wind started coming in.
2. **""eek minut baad hawa 70kelometer/ghantah kee raftaar say hawa pahunchnay lagi""** - After one minute, the wind reached 70 km/h.
3. **""uss key baad baarish shuroo hogayi, lekin yeah bondein itnee tez aur bary thee keh yeah aap kee jild mein suyee kee tarah chubh rahee thee""** - After that, rain started, with big, sharp drops.
4. **""uss key baad olay asmaan say girnay lagay, jis say log khauf zadah hogaye aur cheekhney chillanay lagay aur eek dosray kee taraf daudnay lagay""** - After that, hail started falling, causing panic.

The question asks what happened *before* the crowd's reaction (panic, screaming, running). The crowd's reaction was triggered by the hail. Therefore, the event immediately preceding the crowd's reaction was **the heavy rain with large drops**. However, the answer options don't contain this directly. Let's consider the options.

*   **A: Zalah baari shuru hogayi thee** - The hail started. This is what caused the reaction, not what happened *before* the reaction. Incorrect.
*   **B: Display paanch minat pichey chal raha thaa** - The display was playing for 5 minutes. This is the very beginning, too far removed from the reaction. Incorrect.
*   **C: Tez hawayein theen** - There were strong winds. This occurred *before* the rain. This is the closest to the event that directly happened prior to the hail and crowd reaction. Correct.
*   **D: Wohh khandaan key eek rukn ka suraag kho diya thaa** - He lost a family member. This happened during the chaos, not before it. Incorrect.

Therefore, the best answer is **C: Tez hawayein theen**.
"
"Warsi key hisaab sey, sabsey tez hawayein kabb shurru huein?","The correct answer is **A: Display key shuru honay key kuch minat baad**.

The passage states, ""Display mein paanch mint dekhnay key baad hawa andar daakhil honey lagi, eek minut baad hawa 70kelometer/ghantah kee raftaar say hawa pahunchnay lagi..."" which translates to ""After watching the display for five minutes, wind started entering, after one minute the wind reached a speed of 70 kilometers/hour...""

This clearly indicates the strong winds started shortly after the display began.
"
"Fred sey pahley, 35°W key mashriq mein kitney baday toofan record kiye gaye hein?","The correct answer is **C: Do**.

The passage states: ""Freed, jonub mashriqi bahar auqianos mein settlite key zariah tasveer kashee key aaghaz key baad abb tak kaa sab say mazboot istewai toofan hay, aur yeah 35 deg dabliyo key mashriq mein abb tak key record kaa teesra badaa samundari toofan hay.""

This means Fred is the third largest hurricane east of 35°W. Therefore, there must have been **two** bigger hurricanes previously recorded in that region.
"
"Jabb Fred Cape Verde jazeeron key paas waqea hua thaa, kiss samt mein yeah chal rahaa thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Shumaal maghrib** (Northwest).

The passage states that ""Freed (fred) ko 105 meal fee ghantah (165kelometer fee ghantah) kee hawaon kaa saamna hay aur woh **shumaal maghrib kee jaanib safar karr rahaa hay**.""
"
Darjah zail mein sey kiski apney pesh rowon key moqabiley ziyadah tez raftaarein theen?,"The answer is **A: 802.11n**

The passage explicitly states that 802.11n has a significantly faster speed compared to its predecessors.
"
802.11b sey hamm aahang pichla honey key liye 802.11n ki khaatir kiya zaruri hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Dohrey radioz**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yeah 802.11a, 802.11b our 802.11g key saath peeche kee taraf mutabiqat pazeer honey kee sahulat day gaa bashartekeh iss base station mein dohra radio ho."" (It will provide backward compatibility with 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g provided that the base station has dual radios.)

The question asks what is necessary for 802.11n to be backward compatible with 802.11b. The passage explicitly says that having dual radios is necessary for backward compatibility.
"
Commonwealth khelon mein tairaaki ki wajah sey kitni taqribaat mein Olympic gold medal paaney waley thay?,"The passage states: ""Olympic gold medalist dolat mushtarikah khelon key *teen railay* aur 100 meter aur 200 meter free style mein tairnay waale they...""

This translates to: ""Olympic gold medalist was going to swim in *three relays* and the 100 meter and 200 meter freestyle in the Commonwealth Games...""

Therefore, he was going to participate in 3 relays + 1 (100m freestyle) + 1 (200m freestyle) = 5 events.

The question asks: ""How many events was the Olympic gold medalist going to swim in at the Commonwealth Games?""

The correct answer is **A: Paanch (Five)**.
"
Olympic gold medal haasil karney walaa apney dard keliye dawa keon nahein ley raha thaa?,"Correct answer is **C: Usko tashweesh thee kehh iss sey uski fitness parr manfi asar padey gaa**

**Explanation:**

The passage states that the athlete *cannot* take the medicine for pain relief because the medicine is *banned* during the games. This implies the athlete is concerned that taking the medicine would be detected and disqualify them, negatively affecting their performance/fitness in the games.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, zalzalah ki sargarmi key baarey mein confusion ka keya baes hua hogaa?","The correct answer is **A: Kaaley badalon ki mojudgi** (Black clouds presence).

The passage explicitly states that ""Pahaad key daaman mein kisee aatish fashani srgarmi say gair mutalliqah gehrey baadlon kee ettelaa di gayee. Baadlon nay uljhan kaa imkaan paida kardiya keh aaya waaqaee aatish fashaan phat padaa thaa."" This translates to: ""Deep clouds unrelated to any volcanic activity were reported at the foot of the mountain. The clouds created the possibility of confusion as to whether the volcano had actually erupted."" Since an eruption would likely cause seismic activity, the confusion about whether an eruption occurred would naturally lead to confusion about seismic activity as well.
"
Ebarat key hisaab sey marhalay ki tabdili kabb waqea hui thee?,"The correct answer is **C: 10 march ko**.

The passage clearly states that ""Zalzalay kee ahem srgarmi jis key baes marhalay mein tabdeeli kee gayee thee, woh 10 march ko...waaqa huyee thee."" (The significant seismic activity that caused the phase change occurred on March 10th).
"
Chandrayaan-1 key qamari prob key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sahi nahein hay?,"Sawaal ka jawaab yeh hay:

A: Prob ko launch karney waley madaar mein eek amalah thaa.

Di gayi maaloomaat mein is baat ka koi zikar nahein hay keh prob ko launch karney waley madaar mein eek amalah thaa. Baaqi teenon beyan sach hain."
Konsa darjah zail bayaniyah durust tor parr qamari prob ki wazahat nahein karta hay?,"Sawaal mein diye gaye passage ke mutabiq, Moon Impact Probe (MIP) chaand key jonubi qutub key qareeb kamiyabi say utra tha. Is ke alaawa, is passage mein zikr hai ke MIP teen ahem sciency aalat lekar jaa raha tha, na ke do.

Lehaaza, jo bayaniyah durust tor parr qamari prob ki wazahat nahein karta woh yeh hay:

*   **A: Isney chaand key shumaali pole key paas lend kiya thaa** aur
*   **D: Yeah do ahem aalaat lekar jaa raha thaa**

Lekin options mein sirf ek hi answer choose karna hay, to sab sey ziyada durust jawab **A** hoga kyunkey passage mein explicitly zikr hai ke MIP ne junoobi qutub per utra tha. Answer D bhi partially wrong hai kyun key passage mein teen ahem aalat ka zikr hai, lekin location ke bare mein galat bayan ziyada bada difference hai.
"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, beemari sey tahaffuz ka konsa paimanah akhir mein naafiz kiya jaye gaa?","The correct answer is **C: Encephalitis vaccines**.

The passage states that the government has promised to produce several million encephalitis vaccines to help health agencies prepare for the next year. Although the other options (insecticides, swine catchers, and mosquito nets) are mentioned as measures taken, the question specifically asks about the *ultimate* measure to be implemented, which is the vaccine.
"
Beemari inssanon tak kaisey muntaqil hoti hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Machchar**.

The passage states that the disease ""pehle suwar mein paida hota hay phir machhar uss ko insaanon ko muntaqil kartay hain"" which translates to ""first originates in pigs then mosquitoes transmit it to humans.""
"
Doosrey jumlah ki nakaami kiss natijah ka baes ho sakti thee?,"Correct answer is **B: Hamm jins samaji jaaton ka mustaqbil ka haque**.

The passage states that the failure of the second sentence, which proposed banning same-sex civil unions, ""mumkenah tor parr mustaqabil mein civil uninon keliye darwazay khol sakta hay"" (could potentially open doors for civil unions in the future).  This means the failure could lead to the future right for same-sex civil unions."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, doosrey jumlah ko kabb hazaf kar diya gaya thaa?","The correct answer is **A: Qanoon saazi key session key doraan**.

The passage states that the change happened ""Iss qanoon saazi key session mein"" (during this legislative session) when the second phrase was removed. While the passage mentions 2011 and Monday, these refer to *when* other events happened related to the bill, not specifically *when* the second phrase was removed. 2015 is when the bill would be reviewed.
"
Kiskey samney “Panama Papers” leak kiya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Press**.

The passage states that the Panama Papers were leaked ""to the press in the spring of 2016"".
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiskey baarey mein bartanavi press ka dawaa thaa kehh wohh dolat chupaney keliye istemaal honay waali bahut see companiyon ka bando bast kar raha thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Deutsche Bank**.

The passage states: ""Bartanvi akhbaar the gargian nay kahaa keh aisa karnay waali 1200 sell companion key eek tehayi ko doiche bank control karta thaa."" This directly translates to ""The British newspaper The Guardian said that Deutsche Bank controlled one-third of the 1200 shell companies used for this.""
"
Darjah zail konsey sayyarah haadsah mein sabsey ziyadah halakatein hui theen,"Sawaal mein diye gaye passage ke mutaabiq, sab se zyada halakatein uss hawai jahaz ke haadsay mein hui theen jo Iran se Armenia ja raha tha aur jismein 168 log savaar thay.

Isliye, sahih jawaab hai:

**A: Iran sey Armenia jarahey sayyarah ka rastah mein tasaadum**
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon Iran mein waqea honany waaley fazaayi hadsaat ki bohtaat ki wajah nahein hay?,"Sahi jawaab hai: **B: Naye sayyaron ki kharidaariyon ki ijaazat deney waley bajat ki kami**

Wajah:

*   **A:** Shaheri aur fauji sayyaron ka purana fleet - Paragraph mein iska zikar hai ke Iran mein puraney jahaz hain.
*   **C:** Pabandiyaan jo naye sayyaron ki kharidaariyon sey baaz rakhti hein - Paragraph mein iska zikar hai ke bain alaqwami pabandi ke wajah se naye jahaz nahi khareede ja sakte.
*   **D:** Sayyaron ki kharaab tariqah sey dekh bhaal ki jaaney waali fleet - Paragraph mein iska zikar hai ke jahazon ki achhi tarah dekh bhaal nahi ki jaati.

**B** ke bare mein paragraph mein koi zikar nahi hai. Bajat ki kami ho sakti hai, lekin paragraph mein iska wazeh zikar nahi hai ke yeh fazaayi hadsaat ki wajah hai. Ahem wajah pabandiyan hain jo naye jahazon ki khareedari ko rokti hain.

"
Iraq ki tahqiqi jaat ki report mein darjah zail mein sey kisko shaamill nahein kiya gaya thaa?,"Correct answer is **B: Yeh elaan kehh kuchh tadiliyon key saath, Iraq mein badhtey huey tashaddud sey bacha ja skata hay.**

The report explicitly states that *no guarantee* can be given that any course of action can prevent further sectarian conflict, internecine violence, or general chaos in Iraq at this point. This contradicts option B's claim that the report suggests violence can be avoided with some modifications.

The other options are supported by the text:

*   **A:** The report is critical of all aspects of current Iraq policy.
*   **C:** The report includes a recommendation to secure Iraq's borders.
*   **D:** The report opens with an appeal for a calmer debate and consensus in the United States regarding Middle East policy."
Darjah zail mein sey kisko Iraq ki tahqiqi jamaat ki apni report mein nahein uthaya gaya thaa?,"Sawaal mein daryaft kiya ja raha hai ke Iraq study group ki report mein darj zail mein se kaun sa pehlu nahi uthaya gaya. Di gayi malumaat ke mutabiq:

*   Report mein khabardar kiya gaya hai ke koi bhi guarantee nahi de sakta ke Iraq mein badhte hue tashddud ko rok sakte hain. Iska matlab hai ke **A** report mein shamil hai.
*   Report hidaayat mein fauri tabdili par zor deti hai. Iska matlab hai ke **B** report mein shamil hai.
*   Report mashriq wusta ke bare mein khuli bahas aur ittefaq raaye ke qayam ki appeal karti hai. Iska matlab hai ke **C** report mein shamil hai.
*   Report mein Iraq ki sarhadon ko mehfuz banane aur apnay parosiyon se safarti talluqat qayem karne ke liye nayi safarati pahal ki sifarish ki gayi hai. Iska matlab hai ke **D** report mein shamil hai.

Lekin, agar hum sawal ko dobara padhte hain: ""Darjah zail mein sey kisko Iraq ki tahqiqi jamaat ki apni report mein nahein uthaya gaya thaa?""

Option A: ""Yeah kehh badhtey huey tashddud ko rokney ki garnatee ka elaan kiya jaye"". Report mein yeh zaroor kaha gaya hai ke iski koi guarantee nahi hai, lekin iska elaan nahi kiya gaya, balke isse inkar kiya gaya hai. Is liye, sahih jawab A hai.
"
"Police key hisaab sey, kisko Provenzano ka dayan haath waala aadmi samjha jaata thaa?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

The passage states: ""Police kaa kehna hay keh low picalo ko hee bartari haasil thee keunkeh woh palarmo mein pervenzano kaa daayan haath shumaar hota thaa..."" (The police say that Lo Piccolo had superiority because he was considered Provenzano's right hand in Palermo...)
"
"Ebarat mein di gayi malumaat ki buniyaad parr, Falcone ki maut ka sabab kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **A: Wohh Rina ki bhadkayi jang mein qatal kar diya gaya thaa**.

The passage states that ""1992 mein maafiya key saleebi jewani falcon aur pawlo borcelino ko halaak karnay daawa kiya thaa."" and that they were killed in the war started by Reina against the state.

The passage does not directly state that Rina ordered the killing of Falcone, but that the deaths happened within a mafiya campaign that Rina started.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon Hitoshi Saito ki taarifein nahein hein?,"Sahi jawab **A: Do baar ka aalami Champion** hai.

Kyunki P statement mein saaf taur par zikar hai ke woh ""sabeqah olympic aur aalimi champion"" they, yeh nahein bataya gaya ke woh ""do baar"" aalimi champion rahe the.

B, C aur D teeno hi durust taarifein hein jo passage mein dee gayi hein.
"
Iwasaki halaf leney sey kahaan bach sakaa thaa?,"Sawal P ke mutabiq, Iwasaki Nepal mein shaadi karne se bach gaya tha. Isliye sahi jawab hai:

B: Nepal
"
Kisney Iwasaki parr hamlah kiya thaa?,"Sahi jawab hai: **B: Qazzaaq** aur **C: Eek kutta**

Iwasaki ko qazzaqon ne loota aur ek dabang kutte ne us par hamla kiya. Is liye B aur C dono hi sahi hain. Sawal mein sirf eek intikhab ka zikr nahi hai, is liye dono sahi jawabat diye ja saktey hain.
"
Alonso ney apni daud kabb khatam ki?,"Sawaal mein Alonso ke daud khatam honay ki timing poochi gayi hai. Paighaam ke mutabiq, ""unn key team saathi fernando alwonso ziyadah tar race sabqat haasil kiye hoay they, lekin shayed aagay waala pahiyah bury tarah phans jaaney kee wajah say unn kaa race putt-stop parr hee khatam hogaya.""

Is liye, koi bhi option durust nahi hai. Lekin sabse Qareeb answer Option A hai kyuki usne apni race, Schumacher ke noqsaan paunchaney se **QUCH der pehle** khatam kardi thi.
"
Kiss wajah sey Schumacher ney apni daud jaldi khatam kar di thee?,"The correct answer is **D: Car key bekaar honay tak ka noqsaan (Car failure)**

The text says: ""Michael shomashir nay apni rees aalonso key kuchh der baad hee khatam karr di, race key doraan mutaddid muqabilon mein moattli key khasarah kee wajah say.""

This translates to: ""Michael Schumacher ended his race shortly after Alonso, due to suspension damage from multiple collisions during the race.""

Therefore, Schumacher's race ended due to damage to his car caused by collisions, resulting in a car failure.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, giraftaaron keliye zamaanat karana kiska kaam thaa?","Correct Answer: D: Adalat ka commissioner

Explanation:
The passage states that the commissioner ""bill tartib deta hay agar manzoor hojaye aur giraftar kiye jaaney waale afsar kee jaanib say dayer kiye gaye elzamaat ko baqayedah shakal deta hay"". This means the commissioner organizes and formalizes the charges filed by the arresting officer.
"
"Ebarat mein mazkoor aarzia pabandi waaley hukum key hisaab sey, giraftaar shudgaan ko 24 ghanton sey ziyadah qaid mein rahney keliye keya rakhney ki ijaazat honaa zaruri hay?","The passage states: ""Iss saal april mein, judge gulan kee jaanib say sahulat key khelaaf eek aarizi restraining order jaari kiya gayaa jo unn afraad ko rehaa karnay say mutalliq thaa jinn ko giraftari key baad 24 ghantay say ziyadah heraasat mein rakhaa gayaa aur jinhon nay eek adalati commissioner kee jaanib say eek bhee **samaat** vasool nahein kee.""

This means that to keep someone detained for more than 24 hours, they must receive a hearing.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Samaat**.
"
"Ebarat ke hisaab sey, mansukh shudah runoff ki wazahat karne keliye kaun si wajah ka istemaal nahein hua tha?","The correct answer is **B: Dastur ka eek tazaad**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Salamati ke Khatraat (Security Risks)** is mentioned directly in the passage as a reason for canceling the runoff election: ""...ohdidaron nay afghanon ko dosray intekhabat key ikhrajat aur security key khatray say bachanay keliye faislah kunn intekhaab mansukh karnay kaa faislah kiya hay.""

*   **C: Ziyada ikhrajaat (High Costs)** is also mentioned directly: ""...ohdidaron nay afghanon ko dosray intekhabat key ikhrajat aur security key khatray say bachanay keliye faislah kunn intekhaab mansukh karnay kaa faislah kiya hay.""

*   **D: Dasturi ibhaam (Constitutional Ambiguity)** is also mentioned. Diplomats are quoted as saying the Afghan constitution has enough ambiguity to avoid a runoff: ""Diplomats kaa kehna hay unn kee nazar mein afghan dastur mein itnay ibhamaat hain kehh run off election kee nobat nahein aayey gee.""

*   **B: Dastur ka eek tazaad (A contradiction of the Constitution)** is what some earlier reports claimed the cancellation *was*. The passage highlights this claim to *contrast* it with the reasons currently being given for the cancellation. Therefore, it is not a reason used to *explain* the cancellation in this passage."
Akhir kaar diplomats runoff ko gair zarury keon samajhte they?,"The correct answer is **C: Dastur mein ibhaam thaa**.

The passage states: ""Diplomats kaa kehna hay unn kee nazar mein afghan dastur mein itnay ibhamaat hain kehh run off election kee nobat nahein aayey gee."" This translates to ""Diplomats say that in their opinion, there are so many ambiguities in the Afghan constitution that a runoff election will not be necessary.""
"
Faata keliye adalati khidmaat kon faraham karata hey?,"The correct answer is **B: Seyasi agents**

The passage clearly states that the ""seyasi agents"" are responsible for providing judicial services under Article 247 of Pakistani law.
"
Faata key “seyasi agents” key barey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sach nahi hey?,"Sahi jawab hai **B: Pakistani sadar ney unka intekhab nahein kiya thaa**.

Diyay gaye paragraph mein wazeh taur par zikar kiya gaya hai ke pakistani sadar ne Faata ke hukmarani ke liye ""seyasi agents"" muqarrar kiye thay. Is liye, yeh bayaniyah ke woh pakistani sadar dwara intekhab nahin kiye gaye thay, ghalat hai. Baqi bayaniyah sahih hain.
"
Kis award keyliye Emma Stone ko namzad kiya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Behtareen adakarah** (Best Actress).

The passage states: ""Gosling aur Stone bittarteeb behtareen adakaar aur adakarah keliye namzad hoay."" (Gosling and Stone were nominated for Best Actor and Best Actress, respectively.)
"
Iss film ko kon sey award ke liye namzad nahein kiya gaya thaa?,"Sahi jawab hai **B: Behtreen visual effects**

Diye gaye passage mein ""behtareen visual effects"" ka zikr nahi hai. Baki sabhi categories (Behtreen Picture, Behtreen Sound Mixing, aur Behtreen Original Gaane) ka zikr passage mein hai.
"
Darjahg zail mein sey konsa zalzalah ke baad eperation mein bacha rahh gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Niigata mein eek power plant**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the ""Niigata parry facture mein qayem kashiwazaki kariwa nuclear power plant mamool key andaaz mein kam karraha thaa."" This means the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant in Niigata was operating normally after the earthquake.
*   The passage mentions that the Sheeka plant reactors were shut down.
*   The passage states that railway service had been disrupted.
*   The passage states that the Noto airport in Ishikawa had been closed."
"Ebarat ke hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey konsey zalzalah ki wajah sey noqsan sey bach gaye they?","Let's analyze the information provided in passage P:

*   ""Nayee gaata parry facture mein qayem kashiwazaki kariwa nuclear power plant mamool key andaaz mein kam karraha thaa"" indicates the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant was operating normally.
*   ""Hoko recoalectric power corporation nay zalzalah say kisee tarah key noqsan kee ittelaa nahein di hay aur yeah kehh sheeka johri plant key number 1 aur 2 reactor ko band karr diyaa gayaa hay"" indicates that while the Shika nuclear plant's reactors were shut down, there was no reported damage.
*   ""Bataya jaataa hay kehh uss elaqay mein 9400 makanon mein paani nahein hay"" means some homes were damaged and without water.
*   ""Mutissirah elaqon mein kuchh sadkon ko noqsan pahunch chukaa hay"" indicates some roads were damaged.
*   ""Ashikawa mein nato hawai adday kaa elaqah bhee band hay"" means the NATO airport was closed due to the earthquake.

Therefore, the only option that experienced no damage, according to the passage, is **B: Sheeka plant mein do reactors**. While the reactors were shut down, there was no reported damage."
"Ebarat ke hisaab sey, darjah zial konsa masalah dastavez mein shamil nahein hey?","The correct answer is **B: 1967 key jang ki wajah (The reason for the 1967 war)**

The paragraph mentions:

*   Border disputes based on pre-1967 borders.
*   The future status of Jerusalem.
*   The issue of the Jordan Valley (Waadi Ardan).
*   Military presence in the Jordan Valley.

It *does not* mention the *reasons* for the 1967 war, only that borders are being discussed in relation to the pre-1967 lines."
Darjah zial mein sey konsa falastin ka motalebah nahein hay?,"Sawal key mutabiq, Falastin ka mutalba darjah zail mein sey konsa nahein hay:

Parraghraf mein wazeh tour parr zikar kiya gaya hay keh Falastin ko 1967 kee jang say pehle kee suratehal key mutabiq sarhad chahiyee. Is key elawa unhoun ne yrroshlam key mustaqbil key hawale sey tasalli bukhsh jawabaat aur Jordan ki waadi mein paanch salah fauji maujoodgi parr bhi razamandi zaahir kee hay. Is liye, ""Jordan ki waadi mein jaari fauji maujoodgi"" Falastin ka mutalba nahein hay, balkeh Israel ka mutalba hay keh waadi mein uss kaa fauji wajood das salon key liye rehna chahiye.

Is liye darust jawab hay:

**B: Jordan ki waadi mein jari fauji maujoodgi**
"
Maa ney kiss mulk mein qanoon ki padhayee ki thee?,"The passage states that the person (""Maa"") attended law school at New York University and Harvard, both of which are in the United States.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Amerika**
"
"Ebarat ke hisaab sey, Maa ki intekhabi jeet mein kiss mulk keliye wakalat moavin bani thee?","Correct Answer: **D: Cheen**

Explanation:
The passage states that despite the accusations against Maa, ""maa nay asl cheeni sarzamin key saath qareebi talluqat kee wakalat karnay waale eek plate form parr aasani say kamiyabi haasil kee"" which translates to ""Maa easily achieved success on a platform advocating close ties with the mainland Chinese territory"". This means her advocacy for closer ties with mainland China helped her win the election.
"
"Ebarat ke bayaniyah key motabiq, Carolyn Wilson ney shahar chorney se pahle kiss keyliye kaam kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**.

The passage states: ""kerayah daaron nay apnay saath honey waale waaqiaat share karnaa shuroo kiya, to uss key shikaar beshtar khandanon ko achanak ehsaas huwa kehh OHA key kirolan walasan nay unn key scurity deposit chori karr liye hain, aur shehar chhod karr faraar ho gayaa hay."" This clearly indicates that Carolyn Wilson worked for the OHA.
"
Season ki baqi chaar race key saath Drivers Championship key chauthey maqaam parr kon thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Bowyer**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Teesre mein, hemlin bees points peeche hay, magar boyar kahnay say paanch points aagay hay...""  This translates to: ""In third, Hamlin is twenty points behind, but Bowyer is five points ahead of Kahne...""

Since Hamlin is in third place, and Bowyer is ahead of Kahne, Bowyer must be in fourth place.
"
"Ebarat mein mazkoor race key baad, drivers championship Kahne ke pass kitney points hein?","Ibaarat mein mazkoor race ke baad, Boyer (boyar) ke paas kitne points hain, iska zikr wazeh taur par nahi hai. Ebarat mein kaha gaya hai ke Hamlin, Boyer se paanch points aage hai. Lekin Hamid ke point number ka hawala dena, hum Boyer ke point number ka hisaab laga sakte hain. Hamid ke paas 2,230 points hain. Isliye Boyer ke paas 2,225 points honge. 

Diye gaye options mein se, koi bhi sahi nahi hai. Sahi jawaab 2225 hoga, jo in options mein maujood nahi hai.

Isliye, sawal mein kuchh galti ho sakti hai ya phir zaruri malumaat ghayab hai.
"
"Ebarat ke hisaab sey, keitni baar logon ney girtey hue shahaabe saqib ka moshahidah kiya hay jinkaa baad mein mirrikhi ulasal honaa sabit huey?","The correct answer is **B: Paach baar**

The passage states: ""Yeah tareekh kaa panchwan baar samjha jaataa hay kehh logon nay qamri aur mirrikhi mawaad ko zameen parr girtay hoay dekha aur usky kimiyayi tor parr tasdiq kee gayee hay."" This translates to ""This is considered the fifth time in history that people have seen lunar and Martian material falling to Earth and it has been chemically verified.""
"
"Jaisa ke ebarat mein mazkoor hey, sachh mein konsey patrhar hein jinka mirrikhi ul asal hona paya gaya thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Unmein sey 34 they**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Zameen parr girnay waale taqriban 24,000 malum shahaabe saqib mein say sirf 34 key mirrikhi ulasal honey kee tasdiq hoyee hay."" (Of the approximately 24,000 known meteorites that have fallen to Earth, only 34 have been confirmed to have a Martian origin).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tamaam July key shahaabe saqib ke phuwar ke dauraan mili thieen:** While some of the 34 meteorites were found during the July meteor shower, the passage states 15 were from that event, not all 34.
*   **B: Unmein sey 24,000 they:** This is the total number of meteorites found on Earth, not the number confirmed to be from Mars.
*   **C: Unki qimat $11,000 soney sey ziyadah they:** This refers to the price of some Martian rocks, not the number of Martian rocks found."
Shomakar kab retired hue they ?,"The correct answer is **B: Apni satvein championship ki jeet key baad**.

The passage states that Shomakar retired in 2006 after winning his seventh Formula 1 championship.
"
Massa kab zakhmi hua thaa?,"Sahi jawab hai **C: Shomakar key retire honey ke baad**.

Kyunki passage mein saaf saaf likha hai ki Massa, Shomakar ke retirement (2006) ke baad 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix ke dauran zakhmi hue the.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, nazmo nasq kaisey AOL ko motassir karega?","Sawaal mein di gayi Ibarat ka matlab hai:

*   AOL abhi tak America mein bade paimane par istemal ki wajah se IM (Instant Messaging) market ko aage badhane mein kamyab raha hai.
*   Lekin is intezam (nazmo nasq, ya regulation) ke saath, yeh aazadi khatam ho sakti hai.
*   Yahoo! aur Microsoft ke sarfeen ki majmuai taadad AOL ke sarfeen ki taadad ka muqabla karegi.

Is ibarat ke mutabiq, nazmo nasq (regulation) AOL ko kis tarah mutassir karega, iska sahi jawab hai:

**C: AOL ke sarifeen ki tadaad ko Yahoo aur Microsoft key sarifeen ki hareef hogi**

Kyunki ibarat mein wazeh taur par kaha gaya hai ke Yahoo! aur Microsoft ke sarfeen ki majmuai taadad AOL ke sarfeen ki taadad ka muqabla karegi, yani AOL ko in se competition karna hoga.

Baqi options sahi nahi hain:

*   A galat hai kyunki nazmo nasq se AOL ke sarifeen ki tadaad kam hone ka imkaan hai, badhne ka nahi.
*   B galat hai kyunki ibarat mein AOL ko tanha taraqqi yafta company hone ki baat nahi ki gayi.
*   D galat hai kyunki ibarat mein AOL ke Amrica mein istemaal khatam hone ki baat nahi ki gayi, balki competition badhne ki baat ki gayi hai."
Darjah zail mein sey kon naye nazmo nasq key baad khatm ho sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **C: AOL ki apne maqam parr bazaar ko taraqqi deney ki aazadi** (AOL's freedom to promote the market to its position).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that with the new system (intizam), ""yeah aazadi khatam hosakti hay"" (this freedom may end). The freedom being referred to is AOL's ability to advance and develop the market at its own pace due to its large-scale usage in the US.
*   The other options are not directly mentioned as being at risk of ending with the new system."
Hamlah mein mare gaye kitney log police officer nahein they?,"Correct Answer: C) 0

Explanation:
The text states that two police officers died in the car bomb attack. The question asks how many people who died were NOT police officers. Since only police officers are reported to have died, the answer is zero."
Hamlah mein mashkook mulzim ki kisney report ki thee?,"Correct answer is **A: Police**.

The passage states ""Police nay kahaa kehh unn kaa shakk hay kehh iss hamlay kaa zimah daar daesh (ISIL) kaa mubbayyanah dehshatgird hay."" which translates to ""Police said that they suspect that the perpetrator of this attack is a suspected terrorist of Daesh (ISIL).""
"
Florida ki jitne waley ki tamaam riyasat hay ki haysiyat ki wajah se Mitt Romney ko kiysa award diya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Riyasat key tamaam mandoobeen**.

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""Choonkeh fateh ko tamaam riyasaton say muntakhab kiya jaataa hay, florida nay romani keliye apnay pachaas mandubin ko nawaza hay..."" This translates to ""Because the winner is selected from all the states, Florida has awarded its fifty delegates to Romney..."" The passage says Florida gave **all** its delegates to Romney, but it's actually 50 delegates that Florida is awarding Romney.

Therefore, C is the best answer.

The other options are incorrect because:

* A: riyasat key 32 mandoobeen (32 delegates of the state) - This is incorrect, the passage said 50 delegates.
* B: Republican Party ki namzadgi (Republican Party nomination) - Romney was pushed forward as a front runner for the nomination, but he did not win the nomination because of Florida.
* D: 46 feesad vote (46 percent of the vote) - This is the percentage of the vote Romney won, not what he was awarded.
"
"Ebarat ke hisaab sey, kitnaa feesad vote Gingrich ko buniyaadi intekhab mein mley they?","The correct answer is **B: 32 feesad**.

The passage states that Newt Gingrich received 32% of the vote in the Florida Republican Party presidential primary election.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab se, kaakas ke natayej ke baad kisney chalanaa jari nahein rakha thaa?","Correct answer: **B: Bachmann**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""August mein aims straw poll jeetnay waali, beak man nay, apni muhim key ikhtetam kaa faislah karr lia."" which translates to ""Bachmann, who won the Ames Straw Poll in August, decided to end her campaign.""

The other options are incorrect because:

*   Gingrich: The passage mentions he criticized Romney but doesn't say he ended his campaign.
*   Perry: The passage clearly states that he initially questioned continuing but then decided to continue.
*   Romney: Romney is mentioned in relation to Gingrich's criticism, but there's no indication he dropped out after the results."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kisney kaakas ka natijah aane key baad eek deegar ummidwar key bary mein ziyadah baat ki thee?","The correct answer is **B: Gingrich**.

Here's why:

*   **Gingrich:** He praised Santorum and criticized Romney. This shows he commented on other candidates after the results.
*   **Perry:** Perry's initial response was about assessing his own future in the race. While he later committed to South Carolina, the initial statement focuses on himself.
*   **Bachmann:** She ended her campaign. No mention of her speaking about other candidates.

Gingrich is the only one explicitly mentioned as talking about other candidates' performance."
Konsi wo tanha jagah hay jahaan 2015 sey pahley show ko dikhaya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: TogiNet Radio**.

The passage states: ""Apnay awail dinon mein yeah show sirf der tak chalnay waali internet radio site toginet radio parr dikhaya gayaa..."".  This indicates that before AstroNet Radio existed (after 2015), the show was exclusively broadcast on TogiNet Radio.
"
Station show ki iss tor parr wazahat karta hay ke usmein kis qism ka ghumao hay?,"Correct answer is **B: Awaami**.

The passage states: ""Station kee web site show kee wazahat kartay hoay kehta hay: """"eek jadeed aur **eshteaal angez awami chakkar waala** qadeem school radio theater"""". ""

"
Konsa bayaniyah durrust tor parr ebarat mein mazkoor naadal aur Raonic ke brusbin opne match key natijah ki akkasi karta hai?,"Correct answer: **A: Raonic ney Nadaal ko haraa diya**

The passage states that Nadal lost to Raonic in the Brisbane Open. So, option A correctly reflects the outcome of the match. Other options are not supported by the passage.
"
"Ebarat ke hisaab se, nadaal aur raonic ki pahle serve key baad kia position thee?","Correct Answer: B: Nadal scored 76 points

Explanation:

The passage states ""Pehli baari mein 76 points say jeetnay waale match mein nadaal nay %88 net points haasil kiye."" This directly translates to ""In the first match which was won by 76 points, Nadal scored 88% net points.

While the other options are true statements from the passage, they do not directly relate to Nadal and Raonic's positions after the first serve:
A - refers to %88 net points, not Raonic and not necessarily after the first serve
C - refers to the overall career score with Canada, not a specific position with Raonic.
D - refers to a loss to Rawank in the Brisbane Open, not Raonic."
Naked News ki teen nayi nashriyaat mein konsi zubaan ka programme shaamil nahi hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Atalwai**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Naked News will launch programs in Spanish (Hispanawi), Korean (Koreayi), and Italian (Italiyan).
*   The passage also says they already report in English and Japanese.
*   Therefore, Italian is included in the new broadcasts, not excluded. There seems to be an issue with the question and the answer, but the correct option from the list is A."
"Ebarat ke hisaab sey, naked news ki nayi nashriyaat kahan dastiyaab nahi hongee?","Sahi jawab hai **C: Theaters**.

Ebarat mein bataya gaya hai ke nayi nashriyaat television, web aur mobile devices par dastiyaab hongi. Theaters ka koi zikr nahi hai.

Kitney Moqabilaa karney walon ney jaaint salalom ko mokammal nahein kiya?,"Let's analyze the passage:

*   The passage states that in the giant slalom, ""majmuyi 117 mein say 45 scares uss muqabilah mean koyee bhee darjah haasil karnay say qaasir rahay."" (Out of a total of 117 participants in the Giant Slalom, 45 failed to achieve any rank in the competition.)

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: 45**"
Konsey darjah zail bayaniye durust tor parr championship mein daud key natayej ki akkasi kartey hein?,"Let's analyze each statement based on the provided text:

*   **A: Doosri daud mein, carpenado ney Hungry ki taraf sey eek scare sey pahle mokammal kiya thaa** The text states that Carpenado finished 1:09.02 minutes slower than the Hungarian skier, meaning the Hungarian skier finished *before* Carpenado. This statement is therefore incorrect.
*   **B: 45 scares ney jaaint salalom mein apni daudein mokammal nahein ki thee** The text explicitly says ""jaaint salalom mein majmuyi 117 mein say 45 scares uss muqabilah mean koyee bhee darjah haasil karnay say qaasir rahay."" This translates to ""45 skiers out of 117 in the giant slalom failed to achieve any ranking in that competition"" and implies that they did not finish the race. This statement is therefore correct.
*   **C: Salalom key moqabile mein ziyadah scares ney jaaint salalo mokammal kiya thaa** In the slalom competition, ""36 harifon kaa natijah yahee thaa"" which translates to ""36 competitors had the same result"" (""incomplete race""). In the giant slalom competition, ""45 scares uss muqabilah mean koyee bhee darjah haasil karnay say qaasir rahay."" which means ""45 skiers out of 117 in the giant slalom failed to achieve any ranking in that competition"". So more participants *failed* to finish the Giant Slalom. Therefore, *fewer* skiers completed the Giant Slalom than completed the Slalom. This statement is incorrect.
*   **D: Carpenado ney salalom mein daswan mokammal kar liyaa** The text says Carpenado's first race (slalom) resulted in an ""incomplete race."" The text states that Carpenado finished 10th in the giant slalom, not the slalom. This statement is incorrect.

**Therefore, the correct answer is B.**"
Darjah zail mein sey konsa NBA ney moattal karney ka faisla kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Basketball season**.

The passage states that the NBA suspended its professional season due to concerns about COVID-19.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, virus key baare mein NBA ki tashwishaat kaa baes kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Utah Jazz key eek kheladi ki jaanch musbat aayi thee**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the NBA suspended the season due to COVID-19 concerns.
*   Immediately after mentioning the NBA's decision, it states that a Utah Jazz player tested positive for the virus. This timing implies that the positive test of the Utah Jazz player contributed to or triggered the NBA's decision to suspend the season because of COVID-19 concerns.
    The other options are not stated, or inferred from the text."
Khel mein Atlanta Thrashers key khilaaf Washington Capitals key liye khel ki jeet kaa goal kisney score kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is A: Nicklas Backstrom.

The passage states: ""Uss raat auchakein nay sab say pehle naa tajurbah kaar nikcles backstarm key fateh goal mein madad kee thee"". This translates to ""That night, Ovechkin first assisted the inexperienced Nicklas Backstrom on the game-winning goal"".
"
Capitals bamoqabilah Thrashers game key dauraan season ka apna 60vaan goal kiss ney score kiya thaa?,"Correct Answer: C: Alex Ovechkin

The passage states: ""Raat mein uss kaa doosra goal, season kaa uss kaa 60van goal thaa..."". This translates to ""His second goal of the night was his 60th goal of the season..."". The passage also mentions that ""Aaj player of the day washington capitals key elks auvichikan hain"", which means ""Today's player of the day for the Washington Capitals is Alex Ovechkin"". Therefore, Alex Ovechkin scored his 60th goal of the season during the Capitals vs. Thrashers game.
"
Northern Rock bank ko kabb hukumat sey himaayat drkaar thee?,"The correct answer is **D: Rahan key bohraan key dauraan**.

The passage states that ""2007 key doraan sab prime qarzah jaati bohraan say saamna honey kee benaa parr northern rock ko himayat kee zaroorat thee"" which translates to ""During 2007, Northern Rock needed support due to facing the subprime mortgage crisis"".
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsey darjah zail bayaniye durust tor parr Warjan group ki Northern Rock bank key saath saudah baziyon ki wazahat kartey hein?","Correct Answer: **None of the options are completely accurate**. Here's why, with explanations based on the provided text:

*   **A: Warjan group ney bhee Northern Rock ki asset management company kharidee thee** - Incorrect. The passage states explicitly: ""Warjeen nay sirf naadran rock key 'achhay bank' ko kharida hay, nah keh isset mangement company ko.""

*   **B: Warjan group ney bank ko uskey qomi milkiyat mein aane key baad kharid liyaa thaa** - Incorrect. The passage states that the Virgin Group bid for the bank *before* it was nationalized, and that bid was rejected. They later bought the ""good bank"" after nationalization and separation.

*   **C: Warjan group ney bank ko rahan key bohraan key baad fauri himaayat ki peshkash ki thee** - Incorrect. The passage doesn't state that the Virgin Group offered *support* during the crisis. It says they bid for the bank *before* nationalization.

*   **D: Warjan group ki bank key liye pahli boli bank key qomi milkiyat mein aaney key baad lagayi gayi thee** - Incorrect. The passage states that Virgin placed a rejected bid *before* the bank was nationalized.

**Therefore, none of the answers are correct**"
"Jaisa kehh ebarat mein bayan kiya gaya hay, konsa mulk Kyoto key mahaul moahedah parr dastakhat karney sey motassir hua thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Australia**.

The passage explicitly states that the ""saabiq conservatives hukumat"" of Australia refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol. While the passage mentions the US, India, and China, it only identifies Australia as a country affected by the decision of whether or not to sign the Kyoto Protocol.
"
Australia ki sabiqah hukumat ka khiyaal tha kehh Kyoto ki tausique kiss cheez ko noqsaan pahunchaaney kaa sabab hogaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Mulk ki maeeshat (Mulk ki iqtesad)**.

The passage explicitly states that the previous Australian government refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol because they believed it would be detrimental to their economy (""uss key iqtesad key liye muzir hoga"").
"
Konsa programme trial mein shooter thaa jiskey liye bharti ki gayie thee?,"The correct answer is **D: Hunting programme ka sporting shooters issosiission**

The passage states: ""ahal razakaron o sporting shooters issosiission key hunting programme key taht bharti kiya gayaa thaa."" This translates to: ""eligible volunteers and sporting shooters were recruited under the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters' Association.""
"
konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr keeday control trial ki akkasi karta hey?,"The correct answer is **B: Shooters ney tarbiyat ki hidayat wosul ki gayee thee**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Pehle nishanah baazi key liye muntakhab kardah chaar nishanay baazon nay jaamaa hifazati aur tarbiyati hidayaat wasool keen."" which translates to ""The first four shooters selected for shooting received protective clothing and training instructions.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chunkehh yehh program ka pahlaa trial thaa, isliye iskee qadr paimayee nahein kee gayee thee:** The passage states the trial was monitored and its effectiveness assessed, so it *was* being evaluated.
*   **C: Shooters rengeron sey hairaan they:** The passage states shooters were closely monitored by rangers, not that they were surprised or amazed by them.
*   **D: Chaar shooters muntakhab nahein kiye gaye they:** The passage explicitly says ""pehla nishanah baazi key liye muntakhab kardah chaar nishanay baazon nay..."" meaning ""The first four shooters selected for shooting..."""
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, tafreeq kahan milli thee?","The correct answer is **D: Ethiopia mein**.

The passage mentions ""Rift Valley Research Service in Ethiopia"" and that the researcher is based there. While the Rift Valley is mentioned, the *location* of the research is specifically Ethiopia.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsi cheez tawaqqo sey pahley waqey hui thee?","The correct answer is **A: Fossil ki daryaft**.

Here's why:

Xinhua khabar rasaan agency sey tazah tareen report mein kiya bayan nahein kiya gaya thaa?,"Sawal ke mutabiq, Xinhua khabar rasaan agency ki report mein ye bayan nahi kiya gaya tha ke chiyarah Ürümqi mein land kiya tha. Balki, report mein ye kaha gaya tha ke Ürümqi mein landing ki ijazat nahi di gayi thi.

Isliye sahi jawab hai:

**B: Chiyarah Ürümqi mein lend kiya thaa**
"
Xinhua ki nayi agency ki sabsey pahli report mein kiya bayan nahein kiya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Chiyarah ko eek bomb ka kharah lahique hogya thaa**

Here's why:

*   **P: Chiyarah hijack karr lia gaya thaa:** This is mentioned in the first sentence.
*   **B: Chiyarah ko fauri lend karney sey manaa karr diya gaya thaa:** This is mentioned by the phrase, ""yurumaqi mein hangami lending kee ejazat nah diye jaaney.""
*   **C: Chiyarah ko wapas Afghanistan key liye mod diya gaya thaa:** This is explicitly stated.
*   **D: Chiyarah ko eek bomb ka kharah lahique hogya thaa:** The initial report didn't mention the bomb threat. It was reported in ""baad mein mosulah ittelaat"" (later received information), so it wasn't in the first Xinhua report."
Radio program key dauraan Sara Danius ney kia elaan kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Committee Bob Dylan key saath rabetah karney key liye koshishein bnad kar dein gee**.

Sara Danius announced that the committee had stopped trying to contact Bob Dylan because they hadn't been able to reach him directly. The passage states: ""Nobel committee baraye adab kee mustaqil secretry saara denius nay ... yeah elaan kiya kehh nobel enaam baraye adab 2016 jeetnay waale baab dylan tak braah raast rasayi haasil nah karr paaney kee wajah say committee nay unn tak pahunchnay kee koshish tark karr di.""

"
Kiss tak pahuncha nahein jaa sakta?,"The correct answer is **D: Bob Dylan**.

The passage clearly states that the Nobel committee was unable to reach Bob Dylan directly.
"
kiss ney ahad parr “eek bada qadam” honey ka tabserah kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Gordon Johndroe**

This translates to: ""Bush's spokesperson Gordon Johndroe called North Korea's agreement a """"big step in the direction of achieving the goal of verifiable nuclear weapons reduction on the Korean Peninsula.""""""

Therefore, Gordon Johndroe is the one who commented that the agreement was a ""big step.""
"
Słania ney motaddid mamalik key liye kitni mahrein banayi thee?,"The passage states, ""unhon nay sweaden aur deegar 28 mamalik keliye 1000 stamp tayyaar kiye."" This means Słania created 1000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: 1000**.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, tanki key vents sey mumkinah tor mosalsal rasao ki wajah kiya hay?","Correct Answer: C: Thermal tausee

Explanation: The passage mentions ""tanki mean bahut ziyadah bhaap kaa jamao thaa"" (too much steam build-up in the tank) as the likely cause of the leak from the tank vents. This steam build-up is a result of thermal expansion (thermal tausee in Urdu/Hindi). Therefore, C is the most accurate answer.
"
Rahat darichey kiyon khul gaye they?,"The correct answer is **A: Tankiyon key andar thermal tausee hui thee**

The passage states that ""tanki key vents say rasao jaari thaa aur ghaliban uss kaa sabab tanki mean bahut ziyadah bhaap kaa jamao thaa"" which translates to ""leaking from the tank vents was continuing and the likely cause was too much vapor buildup in the tank"". Vapor buildup is a direct result of thermal expansion.
"

"
"Katrina toofan key doraan, nawein ward mein kiya hua thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Sailaab ka paani 20 fit ooncha thaa**.

The passage explicitly states that the Ninth Ward ""faced 20-foot-high floodwaters during Hurricane Katrina"". The other options are either inaccurate or related to different parts of the passage.

Hammelton ney deegar mareez ke virus sey moahidaah ke imkaan ki tasdiq nahin ki thee. Aspataal ne sirf mumkanah infection sey bachney ke liye mareez ko deegar say alaihedah kiya thaa, lekin virus ke moahidaah ke imkaan ki tasdeeq nahin ki thee.

Is liye, sahih jawaab **B: Deegar mareez key virus sey moahidaah kaa imkaan** hai.
"
Kuchh aisee cheez kiya hay saiencedaan jiskee khakah bnana chahtey hein?,"The best answer from the given options is **C: Jo namiyaati masalah hay**.

Here's why:

*   The premise (P) discusses the possibility of comets delivering organic matter to Earth, which could have formed proteins and supported life. This points directly to the interest in understanding the specific types of organic molecules comets might have carried. Therefore, identifying ""jo namiyaati masalah hay"" (which organic matter is involved) is a key question.

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Jabb damdaar Sitaraah Zameen key saath takraya thaa** (When the comet collided with Earth): While comet impacts are relevant, the passage's primary focus is not on the impact itself but on what the comet *delivered* - the organic matter.
*   **B: Protein kee tashkeel kaisey hoti hay** (How protein is formed): The passage implies that comets *could* have delivered the building blocks for proteins. The process of protein formation itself is a separate area of study, though related.
*   **D: Zameen ki tashkeel kaisey hui hay** (How the Earth was formed): While related to the origins of life, the passage is more specifically about the potential contribution of comets *after* Earth's formation."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, bandish mein maqami police ney kiya kirdaar anjaam diyaa thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Unhon ney deegar raston ki taraf rahnumayi ki thee** (They guided traffic to other routes).

The passage states: ""motor sawaron ko lamba rasta ikhtiyar kartay hoay jaaney kee hidayat denay keliye 80 police ahalkaron kee madad lie gayee thee."" This directly translates to ""80 police officers were used to guide motorists to take longer routes.""
"
Bandish key doraan tube key daakhli raaston key saath kiya hua thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Unhein block kar diya gaya thaa**.

The passage states: ""Tube key daakhli raaston ko block karnay keliye bharay hoay turkon kaa istemaal kiya gayaa thaa..."" which translates to ""Filled trucks were used to block the entrances to the subway...""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, photographer key gaadi sey takraaney sey pahley kia nahein hua thaa?","Correct answer: D: Potographer Bieber ki tasweer leney kaa ahal thaa

Explanation:
Based on the paragraph:
The other options, A, B and C were the things which were mentioned happened according to the text.
- Photographer ko Highway Patrol ki jaanib sey sadak parr waapass jaaney kaa hukum diya gaya thaa -
This corresponds to the sentence ""uss say california high way patrol police key afsar nay jo trophic stop parr mamur thaa, uss ko hukam diyaa kehh woh do baar sadak paar karkay wapas aayey"".
- Photographer ney apni gaadi photographer parr park ki thee -
This corresponds to the sentence ""photographer nay supploveda balwaar kee doosri jaanib apni gaadi ko khadaa kiya"".
- Photographer ney eek police stop ki tasaaveer lee thee -
This corresponds to the sentence ""sadak paar karnay aur aagay badhnay say pehle uss nay police stop kee picture lenay kee koshish kee"".

D: Potographer Bieber ki tasweer leney kaa ahal thaa
There is nothing in the passage suggesting that the photographer was able to take a photo of Justin Bieber.
"
Photographer gaadi sey takkar khaaney sey pahley kiya karney ki koshish karr rahaa thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Eek police stop ki tasaweer lenaa**.

The passage states: ""Tarfihi news site TMZ kaa manna hay kehh photo grapher nay supploveda balwaar kee doosri jaanib apni gaadi ko khadaa kiya aur sadak paar karnay aur aagay badhnay say pehle uss nay police stop kee picture lenay kee koshish kee.""
"
Konsa bayaniyah durust tor par virus key liye jaanch mein musbat honey key baad ki sadar ki halat ki wazahat nahein karta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Unhein acchaa mahsoos nahein hota hay**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""bukhaar aur kharab gulla honey key elawah, main khud ko achhi aur behatar haalat mein mahsus karraha hon"". This directly contradicts option A.
*   The passage confirms options B and D: ""bukhaar aur kharab gulla"".
*   The passage confirms option C: ""Sadar jamhuria kee haalat mustahkam hay""."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, sadar key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sach hay?","The correct answer is **C: Wohh itnaa accha hay kehh mowasilaati kaam kar sakta hay.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""bukhaar aur kharab gulla honey key elawah, main khud ko achhi aur behatar haalat mein mahsus karraha hon kehh telly commuting key zariye apna kam jaari rakh sakoon."" This directly translates to ""Besides fever and a sore throat, I feel good and better that I can continue my work through telecommuting."" Therefore, he is well enough to telecommute.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Unhein bukhaar nahein hay** (He doesn't have a fever): The passage explicitly states that he *does* have a fever (""bukhaar aur kharab gulla honey key elawah..."")
*   **B: Kayi hafton tak wohh ghar parr hi rahein gay** (He will stay home for several weeks): The passage mentions ""kayee dinon tak ghar parr alag thalag rahein gay"" (several days), not weeks. Also, he expects to be back on Monday.
*   **D: Usko sakht darjah ka virus hay** (He has a severe degree of virus): The passage mentions ""halkay wires kaa asar hay"" (the effect of a light virus)."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Surtaani tofaan gona key kamzor hotey rahney ki tawaqqo kabb thee?","The correct answer is **B: Jabb hawayein taqriban 83 kelometer fee ghantah parr kam hojaye**.

The passage states that ""Aaj saweray hawaon kee raftaar taqriban 83 kelometer fee ghantah thee aur ummid thee kehh kam ho jaye gee."" This directly indicates the expectation of weakening *when* the wind speed was around 83 km/h.
"
Surtaani tofaan gona ki chotti parr hawayein kitni tez theen?,"The correct answer is **C: 149 meel fee ghanta**.

The passage states: ""Apnay orooj parr, surtani toofan gono... hawayein 240 kelometer fee ghantah (149 meal fee ghantah) kee raftaar say pahunch gayein."" This means the peak wind speed was 240 kilometers per hour, which is equivalent to 149 miles per hour.

Darjah zail mein sey kisko carinia brewees ka rawayya nahein samjha jata hay?,"Sawaal ke mutabiq, humein daryaft karna hai ke darja zail mein se kaunsi baat Carinia brewees ke rawaye ko zahir nahi karti.

*   **A:** Yeh tahaalib ki ek qism hai - Yehsahi hay kiunkeh P mein keha gaya hay keh Carinia brewees ""aljaye"" hay, aur aljaye tahaalib ki eek qism hay.
*   **B:** Yeh insaan key aasaab ko na ahal kar sakta hay - Yeh bhi sahi hay, kiunkeh P mein keha gaya hay keh alji aise neuro-toxin banatay hain jo insaanon key aasaab ko na ahal kar saktay hain.
*   **C:** Iska kaseer naam hay - P mein is barey mein kuch bhi nahi kaha gaya keh iskay kaseer naam hen. Yeh nahi keha gaya keh uskay kaseer naam hen ya nahein.
*   **D:** Yeh fitri tor parr waqea hota hay - Yeh sahi hay, kiunkeh P mein keha gaya hay keh surkh jawaar bhaata (Carinia brewees sey) ""fitri tor parr waqea hota hay.""

Isliye, sahi jawab **C: Iska kaseer naam hay** hai."
Darjah zail mein sey kisko carinia brewees nahein kar sakta?,"The passage states that Carinia brevis:

*   Causes red tide.
*   Exists in abnormally high concentrations.
*   Produces neurotoxins that can paralyze the nerves of humans and fish.
*   Kills fish due to high concentrations of toxins in the water.
*   Contaminates water.

Based on this information:

*   **A: Machli key aasab ko na ahal karna (Paralyze the nerves of fish):** The passage explicitly states Carinia brevis produces neurotoxins that can paralyze the nerves of fish. So, it *can* do this.
*   **B: Kisi bhee surate haal mein tadaad mein tezi sey barhh janaa (Multiply rapidly in any situation):** The passage states that natural factors can create ideal conditions where the algae have the opportunity to dramatically increase their numbers. It doesn't say it can multiply rapidly in *any* situation, only under ideal conditions.
*   **C: Paani ko motassir karna (Contaminate water):** The passage clearly indicates that water is affected by the algae, especially with toxic substance. So, it *can* do this.
*   **D: Neurotoxin paidaa karnaa (Produce neurotoxin):** The passage states explicitly that it produces neurotoxins. So, it *can* do this.

Therefore, the answer is **B: Kisi bhee surate haal mein tadaad mein tezi sey barhh janaa**, because the passage implies it needs specific conditions to reproduce rapidly.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon Fleshiya toofan key natijah key tor parr waqea nahein hua thaa?","Sahi jawab hai **D: Sadkon kaa sailaab** (Sadakon ka sailab).

Dye gayi ebarat mein Fleshiya toofan ke natije ke tor parr sadkon ke sailab ki koi zikar nahi hai. Baki teeno options (fayeda mand barish, garaj ke saath barish, aur mokarrar bijlee ki chamak) ebarat mein zikr kiye gaye hain.
"
Fleshiya toofan key barey mein konsaa bayaniyah galat hay?,"The incorrect statement about Tropical Storm Flossie is:

**B: Categri 4 key toofan mein tabdeel honay sey pahley tropical depression key tor parr yehh pahli categri kardah hay**

Here's why:

*   The passage states Flossie *started* as a Category 4 hurricane and *weakened* into a tropical depression before dissipating. Option B incorrectly states it was a tropical depression *before* becoming a Category 4 hurricane."
Konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr 2009 key Grand Prix toofan key natijah ki akkasi karta hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Piquet Jr. ko uskey baad goli maar dee gayi thee**.

The passage states ""2009 key hungri grand parry key baad packet junior ko barkhwast karr diyaa gayaa thaa"", which translates to ""Piquet Jr. was dismissed after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix"". ""Dismissed"" is very similar to ""goli maar dee gayi"".

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** Fernando Alonso was involved in the *event* (the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix), but not directly in the *outcome* of the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix aftermath, which was Piquet Jr.'s dismissal.
*   **B:** The passage describes Alonso winning, not Piquet Jr.
*   **D:** While a safety car *was* involved in the original incident, the question asks about the *outcome* after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix."
Takkar kabb waqea hua?,"Correct answer is **A: Alonso key garhaa stop key fauran baad**.

The passage states that ""Hifazati car say baahar nikalte hoay fernando alwanso keliye eek ibtedayi put stop key foran baad, 2008 key singapore grand parry mein pocket junior takra gayaa thaa."" This directly translates to ""Pocket junior crashed at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix immediately after an early pit stop for Fernando Alonso as he exited the safety car."" This clearly indicates the crash happened immediately after Alonso's pit stop.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zial mein sey kisko aslan tahqeeq kaaron yaqeen karney key moqabiley kam waqt lagaa thaa?","Sawal keh raha hai ke tehqeeq kaaron ke yaqeen ke bar aks, kis amal mein asal mein kam waqt laga.

Ebarat mein kaha gaya hai ke mohaqqiqon ne report kiya ke ""do naslon mein nayi anwaa (species) ka irteqaa huwa, go kehh khayal iss amal nay iss say ziyadah waqat lia"". Iska matlab hai ke mohaqiqeen ne irteqaa mein ziyadah waqat lagney ka andaza lagaya thaa, lekin asal mein yeh kam waqat mein ho gaya.

Isliye, sahi jawab hai:

**D: Parjatiyon kaa irteqaa** (Species ka evolution)
"
Darjah zail mein sey kiski tahqeeq kaaron ney report nahein ki thee?,"Sawal ke mutabiq, tehqeeq mein irteqaa ke amal ki lambai ke bare mein exact time frame nahi bataya gaya, sirf yeh kaha gaya hai ke do naslon mein irteqaa hua, lekin khayal hai ke is amal mein is se ziyada waqt laga. Nayi prajatiyan kahan tashkeel hui (Ecuadori Galapagos jazire), afzaesh mein shamil parindey (desi Darwin Finch aur bahar se aayi cactus Finch) ke bare mein bhi tehqeeq mein bataya gaya hai. Tehqeeq mein nayi parjatiyon ka naam bhi nahin bataya gaya hai.

Isliye, sahi jawab hai:

**B: Irteqaa key amal ki lambayi**
"
Gayon ki parade kahaan hogi?,"The correct answer is **B: Bucharest shahar mein**.

The passage clearly states that ""Iss saal june say august key darmiyan, jonub mashriqi europ mein kaao prade (cowparade) kee mezbani karnay waala pehla shahar ho gaa..."" which translates to ""This year between June and August, it will be the first city in Southeast Europe to host the CowParade..."" and the first sentence also states it will be in ""bakharist city haal"" (Bucharest City Hall).
"
Konsa dajah zail bayaniyah durust tor parr gaye parade ki wazahat krata hay?,"Sawal ke diye gaye passage ke mutabiq, durust jawab yeh hai:

**D: Yeh duniya mein bahut badee awaami fan ki mahfil hay**

Passage mein wazeh taur par kaha gaya hai ke ""kaao prade (cowparade) jo kehh duniya kaa sab say badaa awami fankarana event hay."" Baqi options passage mein sahih tor per nahin bataye gaye.
"
Kiss wajah sey roos ney II-76 key istemaal ko moattal kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: koyi waqea** (a serious accident).

The passage states that ""roose mein yeah pichlay maah eek sangeen haadsah say dochaar ho chukaa hay. uss haadsah key baad roose nay aayi ail-76 tayyaron ko khidmat say bartaraf kardiya."" This translates to ""in Russia, it (the Il-76) suffered a serious accident last month. After that accident, Russia removed Il-76 aircraft from service.""
"
II-76 kiya hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Eek hawayi jahaaz**.

The passage states ""Aayi ail-76 1970 kee dahayi say rusee aur soviet afwaj kaa eek badaa mukawwin rahaa hay"" which means the II-76 has been a large component of Russian and Soviet forces since the 1970s. The context and later mention of ""tayyarah"" (airplane) make it clear that it is an aircraft.

"Ebarat key hisaab, kiss cheez key baarey mein kuchh log nahein chahtey they kehh khawateen baat karein?","Sahi jawab hai:

**C: Khawateen ki sehat**

Yeh ebarat mein wazeh tor par zikar kia gaya hai ke Flock (fluke) likhta hai ke kuchh khwateen ko ""khwateen kee sehat key mutalliq bolnay say jabraan roknay key liye chand logon kee jaanib say kee jaaney waali koshishein nakaam rahein"".
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsa sayyarawi jism sabsey ziyadah motaharrik hoti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Zameen**.

The passage states that ""as far as we know, only one planet besides Titan exhibits dynamics, and that is Earth."" Therefore, Earth is the most dynamic planetary body mentioned besides Titan.
"
Eek saaf shaffaaf sayyaal parr mushtamil nadiyon aur jheelon ki kiss sayyarawi jism parr shanakht ki gayi hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

The passage mentions that Titan is the only celestial body besides Earth known to exhibit hydraulic activity (rivers and lakes of liquid).
"
Inn mein sey konsi tahqiqi pankh daryaft kaa natijah nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Yehh tasdique kehh ziyadah tarr dinosaur key pankh they**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the discovery ""Iss say nah sirf iss baat kee tasdiq hoti hay kehh kam az kam kuchh ddainasooron key pankh hotay thay..."". This implies that it confirms that *some* dinosaurs had feathers. However, the option D implies that *most* dinosaurs had feathers which is not correct. The passage actually says: ""yeah nazariyah pehle hee say baday paimanay parr aam hay,"" meaning that the hypothesis that many dinosaurs had feathers was already accepted. It doesn't say that most of the dinosaurs had feathers.

The other options are all explicitly mentioned as outcomes of the research:

*   **A: Jaanwar key aaraishee pankh ka rang:** The passage mentions the feather color (yellowish-brown).
*   **B: Yehh samajh kehh Udaan mein pankhon ka istemaal nahein hua thaa:** The passage explicitly states that the feather structure suggests they weren't used for flight.
*   **C: Pankh key irteqaa mein baseerat:** The passage mentions how the research provides insight into feather evolution by studying the shaft development in the dinosaur feathers."
Dinosaur key pankhon mein kiya cheez nahein thee?,"Correct answer is B: Eek dandi

The passage states: ""Keunkeh ddaina soor kee pankh mein achhi tarah say tayaar shudah shaft nahein hota, jis ko dandi kahaa jaataa hay..."" which translates to ""Because the dinosaur's feather did not have a well-developed shaft, which is called a dandi..."".
"
ZMapp key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sach nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Yehh mojudah infection ka elaaj karney key qabil hay lekin maut sey bahcaney key qabil nahi hay.**

Here's why:

*   **P states:** ""...ab tak koyee bhee dawaa waazeh tor parr maujudah infection key elaaj keliye mozun nahein payee gayee hay."" meaning that no medicine so far has been found efficient in curing existing infections.

*   **P also states:** ""rasmi tehqeeq say patah challa kehh yeah itnaa fayedah mand nahein thaa jitna maut ko roknay keliye matlub thaa."" which means that research showed it was not beneficial enough to avoid death.

The passage clearly says no treatment has been found to effectively treat existing infections. Option B claims ZMapp *can* treat existing infections, which contradicts the passage.
The other options are true:

*   **A:** The passage mentions ZMapp is an antibody cocktail.
*   **C:** The passage explicitly says ZMapp served as a control in the PALM trial.
*   **D:** The passage states that research showed it was not as beneficial as initially thought."
Konsa darjah zail bayaniyah durust tor par PALM trial ki wazahat karta hay?,"The correct answer is **C: ZMapp ka istemaal trial ki buniyaadi line key tor par hua thaa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""PALM trial mein zemap nay control kaa kam kiya, yaani science daanon nay iss kaa istemaal bees line key tor parr kiya, aur iss key deegar teen elaajon kaa mawaznah kiya."" This directly translates to ZMapp serving as the baseline in the PALM trial against which three other treatments were compared.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tahqiqaat sey zaahir hua kehh ismein sabeqah khiyaal sey ziyaadah fawayed ho saktey hein:** The passage doesn't say the trial revealed *more* benefits than previously thought. It says ZMapp wasn't as effective as hoped.
*   **B: Eek contrrol dawa ka mowaznah teen deegar elaajon sey hua tha, jinmein sey eek ZMapp thaa:** This statement is incorrect because, according to the passage, ZMapp served as the control/baseline against which three other treatments were measured.
*   **D: Mojudah surate haal ka elaaj karney mein Isey motassir dikhaya gaya thaa:** The passage specifically mentions that no drug has been found to effectively treat the existing infection, and while ZMapp initially showed promise, it was ultimately proven to be less effective than anticipated in preventing death."
Tahqiq kaaron key khiyaal mein nayi chip kahaan sabsey ziyaadah aham thee?,"The correct answer is **A: kam aamadni waley mamalik**.

The passage explicitly states that the researchers believe the chip will be most impactful in low-income countries, where it can improve early detection of diseases like cancer, tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria.
"
Tashkhisi tool ki tameer karney key liye konsa tariqah istemaal kiya jaye gaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Meyaari inkjet printer**

The passage states that the chip is likely made using standard inkjet printers, similar to the ones used for printing an American cent.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, goshah dar daagon key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah sahee nahein hay?","Sahi javab hai **D: Unmein sey bahut sey chaand ki satah parr nahein miley they.**

Parr (passage) mein saf saf kaha gaya hai ke gossah dar dag chaand ki satah parr jaa baaja payee jaati hain. Is liya, bayaniyah ke unmein sey bahut sey chaand ki satah parr nahein miley thay ghalat hai.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, zameeni shaklon key motallique konsa nazriyah iss baat ki nishaan dahi karta hay kehh chaand parr waqea honay wali arziyaati sargarmi mojud hay?","Sahi jawab hai **D: Haal mein monasib tor parr zameen ki shaklein bani theen**.

Wajah:

Pura passage lobet scarps ke bare mein baat karta hai jo chand ke sukadnay ki wajah se bani hain aur nisbatan nayee hain. Yeh is nazariye ko challenge karta hai ke chand arziyati srgarmi se mahroom hai.  Isliye, un zameeni shaklon ka haal hi mein banna arziyati sargarmi ki maujudgi ka saboot hai.
"
"Ebaarat key hissaab sey, kiya cheez farde jurm tak ki hadd sey ziyadah ki nahein hogi?","Sahi jawab **A: Mazeed tabsrey** hai.

Ibaarat ke mutabiq, Crown Office ne sahafiyon ko ishara diya hai ke ""koyee mazeed tabsarah nahein kiya jaye gaa kam az kam farde jurm aayed karnay tak.""  Is ka matlab hai ke farde jurm aayed hone tak mazeed tabsere nahi kiye jayenge. Baqi options (Tasweer ki ishaatein, Ainy shahadat key mobahissey, Mazmoon ki ishaatein) ke bare mein ibaarat mein aisa kuch nahi kaha gaya hai ke farde jurm tak wo rok di jayengi.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, sealer key liye haaliyah masalah kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **A: Sakht mosam ki surate haal**.

The passage states that ""intehayi namuafiq mosami halaat nay bachanay kee koshishon mein rukawatein paida kee hain"" (extremely unfavorable weather conditions have hindered rescue efforts). This directly translates to harsh weather conditions being a problem.

While the passage also mentions baraf ki miqdaar (ice quantity) and baraf ka motaapa (ice thickness), the **main** issue preventing rescue efforts is the overall harsh weather conditions. Melting ice is mentioned indirectly as ""barf key tutay hoay todon"" (broken pieces of ice), but the primary problem highlighted is the unfavorable weather.
"
"Baraf key saath, bachao ki koshishon ko aur kiya cheez motassir kar rahi thee?","Sawaal P ka jawaz deikh kar, bachao ki koshishon ko baraf key saath mosam ki intehayi namuafiq surat e haal ne bhi mutassir kiya. Isliye sahih jawab hai:

**B: Mosam ki surate haal**
"
Kis aqeedah ki jawaz dahi karney sey Roberts ney parhez kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Zindagi ki shuruaat** (The beginning of life).

The passage explicitly states that Roberts ""saaf inkaar kiya kehh zindagi kab shuroo hoti hay"" (clearly refused to say when life begins). The other options are things he *did* address or endorse.
"
Konsa mauzu Roberts key ihsaas mein itna ikhlaaqi thaa kehh uss parr bahas nahein ki ja sakti?,"The correct answer is **D: Cason ki takhsisaat**.

The passage states that Roberts refused to comment on when life begins because giving opinions on the specific details of *hypothetical cases* would be unethical. ""Cason ki takhsisaat"" (specifics of cases) is the closest translation of that idea."
Bijlee chamakney ki do kadiyaan kahaan hoti hein?,"Correct Answer: A: Aasmaan ki taraf
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, uss maqam mein aasmaan key naye daagh kabb banaye kiye jaatey hein?","The correct answer is **C: Raat mein**.

The passage states: ""Do light beam aisi nasab kee gayee hain jinn kaa rukh raat bhar asmaan kee jaanib rehta hay."" This directly indicates that the light beams, which could be interpreted as ""new stains in the sky,"" are projected upwards at night.
"
Konsi malumaat tajweez karti hay kehh saton bahnein gaar hein?,"The information that suggests the Seven Sisters are caves is:

*   **A: Darjaye hararat key motagayyaraat (Temperature variations)**

The passage explicitly states that infrared images show temperature differences between day and night, indicating they behave somewhat like caves (being cooler than the surroundings during the day and warmer at night). While the passage also mentions cave entrances and the geological survey, the *temperature variations* are the key piece of evidence pointed to in the passage.

So the answer is **A**.
"
Saton bahnon key thermal rawayyey ka kaisey moshahidah kiya jataa hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Infrared tasaweer**

The passage explicitly states: ""Infraraid images say zahir hota hay kehh din aur raat key temperature key ikhtelafat zahir kartay hain kehh woh donon ghaaron key manind hain.""  This translates to ""Infrared images show that the temperature differences between day and night indicate that they are both like caves.""

Therefore, the thermal behavior of the Seven Sisters is observed using infrared images.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, mushtabah key barey mein konsa bayaniyah sahee nahein hay?","The correct answer is **D: Wohh zakhmi nahein hua thaa** (He was not injured).

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Dhamakay mein zakhmi shakhs ko dhamaka karnay waale mashkook shakhs key tor parr heraasat mein lia gayaa hay"" which translates to ""The injured person in the blast was taken into custody as the suspected person who carried out the blast"". This clearly indicates the suspect was injured in the blast.

The other options are true based on the passage:

*   **A: Hamlah key doraan usney eek gaadi istemaal ki thee** (He used a vehicle during the attack) - The passage says he drove a three-wheeled vehicle into the crowd.
*   **B: Mobaiyanah tor parr usney eek dhamakah kiya thaa** (He allegedly carried out a blast) - The passage says he allegedly used explosive material.
*   **C: Hukkaam uski nasal ko jaantey hein** (Authorities know his ethnicity) - The passage states they know he belongs to the Uyghur ethnic group."
Hamlah ki babat kiss malumaat ki hukkaam ney tasdique ki hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Mushtabah ki nasal**.

Here's why:

*   **P states:** ""...unn ko malum hay kehh uss kaa taalluq awaighoor nasli garoh say hay."" (They know that he belongs to the Uyghur ethnic group.)

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A:** There is no information on identifying any accomplice
*   **C:** The motive is not mentioned.
*   **D:** The first and last name of the suspect are unknown."
Ellis Park key match mein konsi teamein khelein gee?,"The correct answer is **C: South Africa aur Australia**.

The passage states: ""Series kaa hatmi match aglay haftay johannesburg mein ails park mein hoga, jab spring boks australia key saath khelein gay."" (The final match of the series will be next week in Johannesburg at Ellis Park, when the Springboks will play against Australia.)

Since Springboks is the South African team, the answer is South Africa and Australia.
"
Springboks apna agla match kahaan kheley gee?,"The correct answer is **C: Johannesburg**.

The text states: ""Series kaa hatmi match aglay haftay johannesburg mein ails park mein hoga, jab spring boks australia key saath khelein gay."" This directly indicates that the Springboks' next match will be in Johannesburg.
"
Mission key doraan darjah zail mein sey kiskey saath khalaayi station ko prishaani hui thee?,"The correct answer is **B: Eek gyroscope ko barqarar rakhnaa**.

The passage states that the station maintained its attitude despite a ""jeero scope key noqsan"" (loss of a gyroscope) in the first space station mission. This indicates that maintaining a gyroscope was the issue the station faced. The other options are either a result of or unrelated to the initial problem.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, khalayi station key mission ka maqsad kiya thaa?","Sawal mein di gayi ibaarat mein khalayi station ke mission ke maqsad ka wazeh zikr nahi hai. Ibaarat mein sirf yeh bataya gaya hai ke ek gyroscope ke nuqsan ke bawajood station ne apna rawayyah barqarar rakha aur altitude adjustment thrusters istemal kiye gaye.

Isliye, di gayi options mein se koi bhi wazeh taur par mission ka maqsad nahi batata.

Lekin, agar hum ibaarat ko gaur se padhen, toh yeh andaza lagaya ja sakta hai ke mission ka maqsad **C: Eek khalayi chalat firat ko mokammal karnaa** ho sakta hai. Kyunki station apna rawayyah barqarar rakh raha tha aur altitude adjustment thrusters istemal kar raha tha, yeh mumkin hai ke woh kisi khalayi chalat firat ko anjaam de raha tha.

Isliye, sabse behtar jawab **C** hai.
"
Case key barey mein konsa dajah zail bayaniyah sahee nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **D: AOL ko charge kiya gaya thaa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that AOL's headquarters being in Virginia is the reason the case was filed there.
*   The passage confirms that a conviction (a sentence given out) occurred in the case.
*   The passage directly mentions that anti-spam legislation from 2003 was used in the case.
*   The passage says ""AOL kaa mustaqar hay aur jis nay inn ittehamat ko shah di"" meaning AOL provided evidence for the charges and the case was filed there. The question says AOL was charged, which isn't true.

Therefore, **D** is the only statement that is *not* true based on the provided text."
Konsa darjah zail bayaniyah durust tor parr case ki wazahat karta hay?,"Correct Answer: None of the above options are accurately reflecting the case.

Explanation:
- Option A is incorrect because AOL was the company where the case was filed, not the one charged.
- Option B is incorrect because the passage mentions AOL being the base of the case only, not that two internet service providers were involved.
- Option C is incorrect because the case was filed under a law passed in 2003, but the passage doesn't specify if the case trial was initiated in 2003 or later.
- Option D is incorrect because AOL's base was just being used for the filing.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Vidal teen season pahley tak kis club key liye kheltey they?","The correct answer is **A: Sevilla**.

The passage states that Vidal joined Barça (Barsa) from Sevilla three seasons ago.
"
Barça key liye Vidal ney kitney game kheley hein?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The passage clearly states that Vidal played 49 games for the club after moving to Catalin-capital (Barcelona).
"
Match mein mokhalif team kon thee?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**.

The passage states: ""woh bolonia key khelaaf attwaar ko honey waale muqabilay say pehle team hotel mein qeyaam pazeer they.""  This clearly indicates that Bolonia was the opposing team in the match.
"
Jarque hotel mein kion qiyaam kar rahaa thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Uskaa Itwaar ko eek match thaa** (He had a match on Sunday).

The passage clearly states that he was staying at the team hotel before a match against Bologna on Sunday.
"
Jakarta ki geophysics agency keon koyi tanbih jaari nahein ki?,"The correct answer is **D: Usney zalzalah ki shiddat ki zarurat ko puraa nahein kiya thaa**

The passage states that the geophysics agency didn't issue a tsunami warning because the earthquake did not meet the 6.5 magnitude requirement. This directly addresses the question of why no warning was issued.
"
Ebarat key hisaab sey zalzalah ki wajah sey kiya hua thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Maqaami logon ko khauf mein daal diya thaa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that despite there being no tsunami threat, residents became panicked (""bashindgan ghabranay lagay""). This directly translates to the earthquake causing fear among the local people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Eek sunaami ka khatrah:** The passage explicitly says there was no tsunami threat (""Sonami kaa koyee khatra nah honey key bawajood"").
*   **C: Eek jaari kardah tanbih:** The passage states that no tsunami warning was issued (""Sonami kee koyee warning jaari nahein kee gayee hay"").
*   **D: Shiddat key paimaney parr eek 6.5:** While the passage mentions the earthquake's magnitude was 6.5, this was the *reason* no tsunami warning was issued, not a direct consequence of the earthquake itself."
Inmein sey kon suraj aur tamaam deegar sayyaron ki sargarmi ka moharrik hota hay?,"Correct Answer: **C: Ghumao aur roshni**

Explanation: The passage states, ""nizam mein mojud tamaam setaron kee srgarmi kisee aur cheez say nahein, balkeh unn kee roshni aur gardish say mutissir payee gayee."" This means the activity of all stars in the system is influenced by their light and rotation. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.
"
Kisi sitaarey key Rossby number ka tayyun kaisey hota hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Roshni aur ghumao**.

(""A star's Rossby number is determined by using its brightness and rotation together...""). Brightness and rotation are synonymous with roshni aur ghumao.
"
Australia key fauri jamhuriyah bananey mein himaayat karney waaley servery kardah kitney feesad log they?,"The correct answer is **B: 29 feesad**.

This translates to: ""29 percent of the people surveyed at the two extreme ends of the opinion poll thought that Australia should be made a republic as soon as possible...""
"
"Julie Gillard key hisaab sey, Australia ko jamhuri kabb banana chahiye?","The correct answer is **B: Queen Elizabeth II key ahad key baad**.

This directly translates to: ""Then Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ends.""
"

"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Swiss khaatun key saath kiya nahein hua thaa?","The correct answer is **B: Uska qatal kar diya gaya thaa**.

The passage states that the woman was sexually assaulted (ismat rezi), her stolen laptop and phone were recovered, and five people were arrested in connection to the assault. It does NOT say she was murdered.
"
2007 mein kis company ko Taiwan key Sustainable Award sey nawaza gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The passage clearly states that ""Aawsis ko jamhuria cheen key executive yawaan key zariah 2007 taiwan payedar award diye jaaney key baad laptop computer say judaa saarfin kaa bazaar yaksar mukhtalif aur tabdil shudah hoga.""  ""Aawsis"" in this context refers to ASUS.
"
ASUS Eee PC kiya hay?,"Sawal mein ASUS Eee PC ko 2007 mein launch kiya gaya tha aur kaha gaya hai ke yeh ""laptop computer say judaa saarfin kaa bazaar yaksar mukhtalif aur tabdil shudah hoga.""

Is bayan se, hum yeh nateeja nikaal sakte hain ke ASUS Eee PC eek laptop tha.

Is liye sahih jawab hai:

**B: Eek laptop**
"
Gumshudah post ki dastavezaat key liye kon zimmah daar thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Eek ladka**.

The passage states that a boy printed over 600 postal documents, including 429 New Year's postcards that didn't reach their recipients.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, gumshudah dastavezaat key baarey mein kisney maazerat jaari ki thee?","Correct answer is D: Obanazawa ki post office.

The passage clearly states that ""kal dak khane nay shahriyon aur media key saamney apni muazirat pesh kee"" which translates to ""yesterday the post office apologized to the citizens and the media.""
"
Del Potro ko apney kandhey ki prishani ka kabb saamna karna padaa thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Doosrey set key doraan**.

The passage states that Del Potro had his shoulder treated after reaching 6-6 in the second set, requiring a tie-break. This clearly indicates the shoulder issue occurred during the second set.
"
Pahley tie break kaa natijah kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Yehh Murray ney pahley set mein gum kar diya thaa**

The passage states: ""tie break key natijah mein maray pehla seat haar gayaa."" (in the tie-break Murray lost the first set). This confirms that Murray lost the first tie-break.
"
"Jaisa kehh ebarat mein bayan kiya gaya hay, kisko, khaas tor parr, eek mareez key samney beneqaab kiya gaya thaa?","The correct answer is **B: Bachchey**.

The passage states: """"aaj hamein malum huwa kehh baaz school jaaney kee umar key bachay uss mareez say raabtay mein paaye gaye hain."""" This directly translates to ""today we found out that some school-age children were found to be in contact with the patient.""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, governor ney Texas key shahriyon ko khitaab kartey waqt kiya yaqeen dahaani karayee thee?","The correct answer is **B: Logon ka tahaffuz bachaney key liye kaam kiye jaa rahey hein** and **A: System achchey sey kaam kra rahaa hay**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""P: ""...uss nay taxas key shahriyon ko itminan dilaya kehh public kee salamati ko barqarar rakhnay key liye qadm uthaye jaa rahay hain."" This translates to: ""...he assured the citizens of Texas that steps are being taken to maintain public safety."" This directly supports option B (Logon ka tahaffuz bachaney key liye kaam kiye jaa rahey hein).

*   The passage also states: """"yaqeen rakhein hamara nizam isee tarah kam karr rahaa hay jis tarah usay karnaa chahiye."""""" This translates to: ""Rest assured, our system is working the way it should."" This directly supports option A (System achchey sey kaam kra rahaa hay).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **C: Challenge ko puraa karney key liye unhein lais kiya gaya thaa** - While the governor implies preparedness, the passage specifically refers to the few places in the world being better prepared to deal with the challenge.
*   **D: Case sanjeedah nahein hay** - The passage explicitly states, """"yeah muamilah sanjidah hay,"""" meaning ""This case is serious.""

Therefore, the most accurate and direct answers based on the passage are A and B."
Khabar ka konsa parody zariyah do saabiq UW talabah ney takhlique kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Piyaaz (The Onion)**.

The passage states: ""Apnay aaghaz say hee aawneen print edition, tanziyah khabron kaa eek haqeeqi umpire bann gayaa hay..."" (From its start, The Onion print edition has become a true empire of satirical news...). This directly links the creation of the satirical news outlet to ""The Onion.""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, inmein sey kon piyaaz ki khabron key parody sultanat mein shaamil nahein hay?","The correct answer is **B: Eek film**.

The text mentions the following as part of The Onion's news parody empire:

*   A: Eek aalami atlas (a recently launched global atlas)
*   C: Eek website (with 5,000,000 unique visitors)
*   D: Eek chapayi ki tadween (the original print edition)

A film is not mentioned in the passage as part of The Onion's empire.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, police kiss cheez ki hifaazat kar rahi thee?","Ebarat ke hisaab se, police ""neechey jaati galee ka dakhli rastah"" (Downing Street ke dakhli raastay) ki hifazat kar rahi thee.

So the correct answer is:

**C: Neechey jaati galee ka dakhli rastah**
"
Kiss waqt police ney mozahereen sey tarteeb sey chalney ko kahaa thaa takehh mazeed traffic ki tameer sey bacha ja sakey?,"The correct answer is **D: 11:20 bajey**.

The passage states: ""11:20 bajay police nay ehtejajiyon say kahaa kehh woh sadak chhod karr foot paath parr muntaqil ho jayein..."" which translates to ""At 11:20, the police told the protestors to leave the road and move onto the sidewalk..."" This clearly indicates the time the police asked the protestors to move to avoid further traffic buildup.
"
Dr. Ehud Ur ki jaanib sey ki gayi tahqiq key baarey mein kiya sahee hay?,"Correct Answer: D: kuchh gair diabetes waaley choohey abb diabetes waaley hein

Explanation:

*   The passage states: ""abb hamare paas gair ziyabis waale 4 mahinay kee umar key choohay hain jinhein shoogar hojaya karta thaa"". This directly translates to ""now we have 4-month-old non-diabetic mice that used to get sugar (diabetes)"". While the wording is a bit convoluted, the meaning is that these mice *didn't* have diabetes before, but *now* they do.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   A: The passage quotes Dr. Ur as saying that the results are not applicable to people already with type 1 diabetes.
*   B: The passage says non-diabetic mice *now* have diabetes. The opposite of what this choice states.
*   C: Dr. Ur expresses skepticism about a cure for diabetes, so he is not optimistic."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Dr. Ur Shakki key baarey mein kiya hay?","The correct answer is **B: Agar koyi elaaj mumkin ho** (If a cure is possible).

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Kuchh doosray mahireen kee tarah say, unhein iss baaray mein shakk hay kehh aaya diabetes kaa elaaj kiya jaa sakta hay..."" (Like some other experts, he is doubtful that diabetes can be cured...). This directly indicates Dr. Ur's skepticism regarding the possibility of a cure."
Konsa darjahg zail bayaniyah durust tor parr parwaaz CG4684 key tasaadum ki wazahat karta hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Sayyarah key tabaahi key maqaam ki talaash mosam sey motassir hui thee.** (The search for the plane's crash site was affected by the weather.)

Here's why:

*   **P:** States the search was hampered by the same bad weather that caused the landing to be aborted.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mosam ki wajah sey sayyarah asal mein lend karney key qabil nahein thaa.** (The plane was not actually able to land due to the weather.) While the weather *prevented* the initial landing attempt, the passage doesn't say the plane was inherently *unable* to land because of the weather. It was a factor, but not a statement of impossibility. The plane attempted a second landing.
*   **B: Sayyarah eek bahut door key mahalley waqoo mein girkar tabaah hua thaa.** (The plane crashed in a very remote location.) While the crash site *is* remote (requiring police to hike in), this isn't the *primary* explanation of the crash. The passage focuses on the landing attempts and the impact of weather on the search.
*   **C: Tabaah honay sey pahley sayyarah ney teen baar lend karney ki koshish ki thee.** (The plane attempted to land three times before crashing.) The passage states the plane attempted to land *twice*, being rocked on the first attempt and disappearing on the second just before landing."
kiss wajah sey parwaaz CG4684 ney apni lending ko saaqit kar diya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Mosam ki surate haal kharab thee** (The weather conditions were bad).

The passage states: ""Usee kharab mausam kee wajah say jo landing key mansukhi kaa sabab banaa talashi key kaam mein khalal padaa."" This translates to: ""Due to the same bad weather that caused the landing to be cancelled, the search operation was disrupted.""
"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, Franciszek Kowal key tajrabah key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah sahee hay?","The correct answer is **B: Bilaakhir usko noqsan nahein pahuncha thaa (In the end, he was not harmed)**.

Here's why:

*   The text states, ""khush qismati say meray saath kuchh nahein huwa"" which translates to ""Luckily, nothing happened to me."" This directly supports option B.

The other options are not supported by the text:

*   A: The text mentions ""unhon nay khidki say nikalna shuroo kiya"" which means ""they started exiting through the window,"" but it does not explicitly mention Franciszek Kowal himself breaking the window.
*   C: The text says ""Log kursiyon say khidki key chokhaton ko maar rahay they"" which means ""People were hitting the window frames with chairs,"" but it does not specify that Franciszek Kowal broke a chair.
*   D: The text does not mention him getting injured."
Surataani toofan Danielle key mumkanah asar ki paimaesh karna challenge ka kaam keon thaa?,"Sahi jawab C hai: **Toofan landfall sey door hay**

Diye gaye passage mein saaf taur par kaha gaya hai ke “Chonkeh toofan land fall say bahut door hay, iss liye riyasathaye muttahedah yaa caribean key mumkanah asraat kaa andazah lagana mushkal lag rahaa hay.” (Kyuki toofan landfall se door hai, isliye United States ya Caribbean par iske mumkinah asarat ka andazah lagana mushkil lag raha hai.)

Is liye C sahi jawab hai kyunki ye passage mein di gayi wajah ko directly batata hai ke Danielle ke mumkinah asrat ki paimaish karna challenge kyun tha.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, surtaani toofan Danielle key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniya sahee naein hay?","Sahi jawab hai **D: Yehh landfall sey qareeb hay**.

Ebarat mein wazeh taur parr kaha gaya hai ke ""Toofan landfall say bahut door hay..."" Is liye yeh option sahi nahi hai. Baki sab options, A, B, aur C ebarat mein zikr kiye gaye hain.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, aalimi wabaa paida karnay say pehle beemari key saath kiya honay ki tajweez dee gayee hay?","The correct answer is **A: Isey lazmi tor parr kam mohlik hona zaruri hay**.

The passage states: ""Unhon nay kahaa kehh kuchh mutaliat batatay hain kehh iss beemari ko aalimi wabaa paida karnay say pehle lazmi tor parr kam jaan leva honaa chahiye."" This directly translates to ""They said that some studies show that this disease must become less lethal before causing a global pandemic.""  This aligns with option A.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, toofan Fujian sey kitna door thaa?","The correct answer is **C: 70 kilometer**.

The passage states: ""maurakot kee nigaah cheeni soobay foziyan say taqriban sattar kelometer door markooz thee.""  This translates to ""Morakot's focus was approximately seventy kilometers away from the Chinese province of Fujian.""
"
George W. Bush key Asia pahuchney parr kisney unko mobarkbaad dee thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng aur Lee Hsien Loong**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Uss kaa isteqbal singapore key **naib wazir aazam wong kaan saing kee jaanib say kiya gayaa** aur singapore key wazir aazam lie seen long key saath tejarat aur dehshat gardi key omur parr baat cheet huyee.""

    *   This translates to: ""He was received by Singapore's **Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng** and he discussed trade and terrorism issues with Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.""
"
Asia kee tejarati tausee key baarey mein sadar ney kabb baat ki thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Apni wast muddati intekhaab ki haaron key baad**

The passage explicitly states: ""Darmiyani madad key intekhabat mein haftay bhar shikast khaaney key baad, bush nay nazireen ko asia mein tejarat mein tausee karnay key baaray mein bataya."" (After losing the midterm elections a week ago, Bush told viewers about expanding trade in Asia.)
"
"Ebarar key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey konsa hukumat ka majmooyi maqsad hay?","Sawal P mein, kaha ja raha hai ke elaan ka maqsad March mein extra gaadiyon ke liye fund dena hai aur 300 coaches khareedne se ab total 1300 coaches jama ho gaye hain jo bheed kam karne mein madad karenge.

Sawal Q puchh raha hai ke hakumat ka overall maqsad kya hai.

Ab options dekhte hain:

*   **A: Iss saal March tak mazeed gaadiyon ko funding karnaa:** Yeh elaan ka ek hissa hai, lekin yeh overall maqsad nahi hai.
*   **B: Kul 300 gaadiyaan haasil karna:** Yeh bhi elaan ka ek hissa hai, lekin total maqsad nahi.
*   **C: Ezafi 1,300 gaadiyaan haasil karna:** Yeh aik objective hai, lekin yeh zaruri nahin ke overall maqsad ho.
*   **D: Zarurat sey ziaydah gaadiyon ki bheed ko kam karna:** Yeh woh hai jo 1300 dabbon ki khareed sey haasil karna maqsad hai.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Zarurat sey ziaydah gaadiyon ki bheed ko kam karna.**"
Hukumat ney kiya elaan kiya thaa?,"Sahi jawab hai:

**A: Unka ezafi 300 gaadiyon ko fund karney ka mansubah hay**

Explanation:

P statement bilkul seedhay tor par kehta hay kay ""Aaj key elaan nay iss saal march mein izaafi gaadiyon ko fund mohyya karnay keliye hokumat key azm ko mazeed wusaat dye hay."" Iska matlab hai kay hukumat ney jo elaan kiya wo issi saal march mein aur 300 gaadiyon ko fund karne ka azm (plan) hay.

Other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Gaadi key masalah sey raahat paaney ka unka azam hay:** Ye statement sahi hai lekin P statement mein exact announcement ki baat ho rahi hai, sirf azaim ki nahi.
*   **C: Unka ezafi 1,300 gaadiyon ko fund karney ka mansubah hay:** P statement mein 1300 dabbon (coaches) ki total tadad batayi gayi hai, na kay naye elaan mein fund kiye janey waley coaches ki tadad.
*   **D: Zarurat sey ziyadah bheed ka masalah March tak hal ho jaye gaa:** P statement mein sirf fund mohyya karnay ka elaan hai, is problem ko hal karne ke time ki koi baat nahi hai."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsi malumaat malum hay?","The correct answer is **A: Khatrey ki satah kam ho gayi hay**

Here's why:

*   **P** states: ""Khatray kee satah ko shadeed zumray say kam karnay kaa matlab yeah nahein hay kehh majmuyi tor parr khatra door ho gayaa hay."" (Reducing the threat level from a severe category does not mean that the overall threat has disappeared.)

This directly implies that the threat level *has* been reduced, even if it hasn't been eliminated.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Abb aur koyi khatrah nahein hay** - The passage explicitly states that the overall threat *has not* disappeared.
*   **C: Eek hamlah ki tawaqqo hay** - The passage mentions that suggesting an attack is *imminent* is unwise. So, the text doesn't confirm that there is an expected attack.
*   **D: Intelligence ney tasdeeq ki hay kehh hamlah sakht hogaa** - The passage doesn't discuss an intelligence report.

Therefore, the passage directly states that the threat level has been reduced.
"
Mozaheron key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah sahee nahein hay?,"Sawal mein, humhein bataya gaya hey keh ""intekhabat karaney mein nakaami nay waqti purr tashaddud mozahiron ko bhadkaya."" Iska matlab hey keh intekhabaat mein der sey mozaherey bhadkey they.

A: Sadarati commisssion mozaheron ka jawaab thaa - Yeh bayaniyah sahee hey, kyunkeh paragraf mein bataya gaya hey keh ""October mean shuroo honey waale hukumat mukhalif muzahiron parr marteli kaa radde amal commission thaa.""

B: Zaruri intekhabaat sey mozaherey bhadkey they - Yeh bayaniyah sahee nahein hey. Haqeeqat mein, zaruri intekhabaat na karaaney sey mozaherey bhadkey they.

C: Mozaheron mein saabiq CEP key istefaa kaa motalebah thaa - Hum ney teksit mein CEP key istefaa kaa koi zikr nahein dekha, hum sirf yeh jantey hain keh unhein waqat sey pehley subukdosh kar diya gaya thaa.

D: Mozaherey baaz auqaat purr tashaddud ho jatey they - Yeh bayaniyah sahee hey, kyunkeh paragraf mein zikr kiya gaya hey keh ""waqti purr tashaddud muzahiron.""

Isliye, sahee jawaab **B: Zaruri intekhabaat sey mozaherey bhadkey they**."
Akhri CEP key istefaa ki kisney tajweez dee thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Sadarati commission ney** (Presidential Commission).

The passage states: ""Guzashta maah sadarati commission nay... cep kee qabal az waqat subukdoshi kee tajweez dye."" This translates to ""Last month the presidential commission... suggested the early dismissal of the CEP.""
"
"Bayaniyah ke hisaab sey, Ameriki Gymnastics ney khelaadiyon key saath Nassar ki badsoluki key baad kiskee moawanat nhein kee thee?","The correct answer is **A: Adame tasdeeq (Decertification)**.

The passage states that US Gymnastics believes ""hamari tanzeem hain baa maanee taggaiurat laayein beh nisbat iss key kehh certification ko laghu kiya jaye"" (it's better to make meaningful changes in our organization than to decertify). This clearly indicates they are *not* supporting decertification.
"
"Bayaniyah key hisaab sey, Ameriki Gymnastics aur Ameriki Olympic Committee dono key aagey badhney ka asal maqsad kia hay?","The correct answer is **D: Kheladiyon key liye eek mahfooz mahaul farog denaa** (Promoting a safe environment for athletes).

The passage explicitly states: ""Ameriki gymnastics aur USOC kaa eek hee hadaf hay- gymnastics aur deegar khelon ko aithleton keliye mumkanah hadd thak mahfuz banana"" (American Gymnastics and USOC have the same goal - to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible for athletes). This directly translates to promoting a safe environment for athletes.
"
Hadsah key waqea honay key waqt jahaaz kiss traf pesh qadmi karr rhaa thaa? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palawan**.

The passage states: ""yeah jahaaz palawan mean pewarto prencisa mean apnay safar parr gamzan thaa."" which means the ship was underway towards Palawan.
"
Ebarat mein mazkoor jahaaz key baarey mein konsee sahee haqiqat nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Iskee bunyaad Palawan mein hay** (Its base is in Palawan).

Here's why:

*   **A: Yehh Puerto Princesa ki taraf apney raastey mein thaa** (It was on its way to Puerto Princesa) - The passage states the ship was ""gamzan"" (immersed/involved) on its journey to Puerto Princesa in Palawan.

*   **C: Yehh kaan kuni ka insedaad iqdamaat ka jahaaz hay** (It is a mine countermeasure ship) - The passage identifies the ship as an ""Avenger class mine jehaaz ko jawabi tadbir deti hay"" (Avenger class mine countermeasure ship).

*   **D: Isey Ameriki bahriyah key saatvein bedaa ko tafweez kiyaa gayaa hay** (It is assigned to the US Navy's Seventh Fleet) - The passage says ""Uss ko US neevi key saatwein bedah say munsalk kiya gayaa hay"" (It is attached to the US Navy's Seventh Fleet).

*   **B: Iskee bunyaad Palawan mein hay** (Its base is in Palawan) - The passage states ""Uss kaa mustaqir saw seebo, nagasaki, japan hay"" (Its permanent base is Sasebo, Nagasaki, Japan). Therefore, it is NOT based in Palawan."
Kisney Ameriki faujiyon key baarey mein bayan diya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**.

The passage states that ""America key sadar Donald Trump nay press secretary key zariah eek biyaan mean elaan kiya kehh ameriki fauj shaam chhod den gee,"" meaning that President Donald Trump made the announcement about the American forces leaving Syria through a statement by the press secretary.
"
"Bayaan ke hisaab sey, kiss mulk ney qaidee ladaakon ki nigraani ka zimmah liya hay?","The correct answer is **D: Turkee**.

The passage states: ""Turki ISIS key unn giraftar jang baazon ko bhee guard karay gaa jinn ko europi aqwam nay wapas lenay say inkaar kiya."" (Turkey will also guard the captured ISIS fighters that European nations have refused to take back). This indicates that Turkey is taking responsibility for guarding the captured fighters.
"
Yaqeeni tor parr tasaadum ki kiya wajah hay?,"The passage states: ""Haadsah oonchi pahadiyon key beach pesh aaya, aur manna jaataa hay kehh dushmanon kee taraf say kee gayee goli baari kaa natijah hay."" (The accident occurred in the high mountains, and it is believed to be the result of firing from the enemy.)

Therefore, the most likely cause of the crash, according to the passage, is:

*   **B: Dushmani ki aag (Enemy fire)**

So the answer is **B**.
"
Kiss qism key khittah mein tasaadum waqea hua thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Pahaadi**.

The passage states, ""Haadsah oonchi pahadiyon key beach pesh aaya..."" which translates to ""The accident happened in between tall hills/mountains..."". This directly indicates the terrain was mountainous.

Option B: Sakht which translates to ""Difficult or Harsh"" is mentioned in the passage ""sakht nahamwar khittay kaa saamna karnaa parh rehaa hay"" that they are facing difficult or harsh terrain. Although this is mentioned, it's separate from where the accident occurred."
Sailaab key natijah key tor parr afsaraan kiya ummid thee?,"The correct answer is **A: Sandbarz kee bahaali** (Restoration of sandbars).

The passage states: ""halankeh sailaab key baad aabi satah mahaz chand fit oper aayey gaa, leakin afsaran ko tawaqqo hay kehh yeah dhaar mean behh gaye ret key todah ko behaal karnay keliye kaafi hoga"" (Although the water level will only rise a few feet after the flood, officials expect it to be enough to restore the sandbars swept away in the stream). This directly indicates the officials' expectation is the restoration of sandbars.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kiss parr dam ki tameer mustaqil asar pada thaa?,"The passage states that the dam prevented sediment spread, which is necessary for forming sandbars and coastal habitats. It also mentions that two fish species became extinct and the humpback whale is endangered.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Sandbarz:** The passage directly states that the sediment needed to form sandbars was stopped by the dam. So, sandbars were directly affected.
*   **B: Humpback chubs:** While the passage mentions the humpback whale, it doesn't specifically say ""humpback chubs."" However, the extinction of two fish species suggests a negative impact on fish populations.
*   **C: Jangali zindagi ki rehaaesh gahein (Wildlife habitats):** The passage explicitly mentions that the sediment is necessary for creating wildlife habitats. The dam's presence prevents the spread of the sediment which leads to the destruction of the habitat.
*   **D: Telchat ka failao (Sediment spread):** The passage states that the dam prevented sediment spread.

Considering the question asks for the *permanent* impact:

*   Preventing sediment spread is the initial, direct effect. The extinction of fish and endangerment of the humpback whale are *consequences* of the altered environment. The decline in sandbars is also a direct result.
*   The statement is clear in its explanation for how the sediment is vital in making sandbars and wildlife habitats. So these have a permanent impact.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **C: Jangali zindagi ki rehaaesh gahein (Wildlife habitats)** and **A: Sandbarz**. However, option C is the most encompassing option."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kisney America ko mumkanah khatraat key baarey mein suraag diya thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Eek giar Zahir Zariyah (Eek poshidah Zariye)**

The passage states: ""U.s. key mutabiq usay eek **poshidah zariye** say malumat mosul hoyee hain..."" which translates to ""According to the U.S., it received information from a **hidden source**...""

Therefore, option C is the most accurate reflection of the information provided in the passage."
Darjah zail bayaniyah mein sey kon durust tor parr shiddat pasandon key mobaiyyanah hamlah key mansubah ki wazahat karta hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Do mamaalik mein aham maqamat parr bam dhamakey**.

Here's why:

*   The statement explicitly mentions that the attacks are planned in **Kenya aur Ethiopia (two countries)**.
*   It also specifies that the attacks will target """"**numayan elaqon**"""" which translates to """"prominent areas"""" in those countries meaning **Aham maqamat (important locations)**."
Darjah zail logon mein sey kon wakeel nahein hay,"The correct answer is **D: Makis Triantafylopoulos**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""Mashhur yunani wuklaa, sex kichajioglo aur jorge nikolapolis ko... jail mean qaid karkay rakhaa gayaa hay."" This identifies Sakis Kechagioglou and George Nikolakopoulos as lawyers (wuklaa).

*   The passage states that Petros Mantouvalos is a member of parliament (rukn parliman) and a lawmaker (qanoon daan). Although he is a lawmaker, it doesn't state that he is a lawyer.

*   The passage identifies Makis Triantafylopoulos as a journalist. Therefore, he is not a lawyer."
Yunani qanooni community mein scandal kaa hissah honay key tor parr logon ki kiss jamaat kaa tazkarah nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Journalist**.

The passage mentions judges, lawyers (wukalaa and attorneys), and solicitors as being part of the legal community involved in the scandal. Journalists are the ones who exposed the scandal, but they weren't part of the corruption itself."
Hindustan ney kitney wicket khoye they,"The correct answer is **A: 11**.

Here's the breakdown:

*   The passage states India lost **7** wickets after the captain's wicket.
*   The passage also says that two other batsmen Sachin and Rahul contributed to the score. We can reasonably assume that they may have lost some wickets as well.
*   The passage also tells us that the rest of the batsmen lost 7 wickets. Thus, we need to figure out how many were lost before the final 7 wickets were taken. We are told that 3 batsmen Sachin, Rahul, and the Captain contributed to the score.
*   The passage also refers to R. Uthappa who built the innings.
*   This gives us 5 batsmen who the passage refers to. If we assume that there are 11 batsmen (2 batsmen more than the 9 standard cricket batsmen) in the whole team then we know that at least 6 batsmen (11-5) were responsible for a loss of wickets prior to the final 7 wickets being lost.
*   Given our limited understanding of the context from the passage provided we can assume that Sachin and Rahul both lost their wickets. In that case 3 of the 11 wickets were lost prior to the final 7 wickets. 3 + 7 = 10. The closest answer to 10 is 11 and that is the correct one."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, uss paari ka sabsey ziyadah score kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **A: 70 run**.

The passage clearly states that Robin Uthappa made the highest score of the innings with 70 runs.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon Adam Cuerden ki mayoosi ki wajah nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Jinsi mashmool key baarey mein site ki nayi policy**.

Here's why:

*   The passage clearly states that Cuerden is upset because:
    *   Wells lied from the beginning.
    *   Wells acted as if the legal reasons were causing the actions.
    *   Wells pretended to be listening.
    *   Wells had removed fan works.

Therefore, **B: Wales key fan ka hazaf, C: Wales key zariyah na sunaa janaa, and D: Fan key hazaf ki wajah key baarey mein jhoot** are all explicitly mentioned as reasons for Cuerden's disappointment.

**A: Jinsi mashmool key baarey mein site ki nayi policy** is mentioned in the passage as the reason for the existing effort to develop such a policy for the place. It is **not** mentioned as one of the reasons Adam Cuerden is disappointed.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, site sey kiya hazaf kar diya gaya thaa?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: jinsi mashmool (jinsi mawaad)**.

The passage mentions ""...maqaam key liye jinsi mawaad key hawalay say aisi policy tayaar karnay kee maujudah koshishein hoyein..."", which translates to ""existing efforts to develop such a policy regarding sexual content for the site..."". This indicates that sexual content is the subject of the deletions (hazaf kaariyon).
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kiskee Amir Khan himayat nahein kartey?","The correct answer is **A: Olympics mein khawateen ladakon ko shaamil karnaa** (Including women fighters in the Olympics).

Here's why:

* The passage clearly states Aamir Khan's personal opinion: ""zaati tor parr mera khayal hay kehh khwateen ko ladna nahein chahiye yeah mera nuqtah nazar hay."""" (Personally, I don't think women should fight, that's my point of view.) This directly opposes women's inclusion in fighting/boxing in the Olympics.
* The passage states that he would support the athletes at the 2012 Olympics games despite his previous statements.
* The passage does not state Khan's opinion of the other options, therefore, the first option is the correct answer."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kiskee apney zaati nazriyah key bawajood Amir Khan himayat kar rahey hongein?","The correct answer is **A: Khawateen ladakey**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Amir Khan personally doesn't believe women should fight.
*   However, despite his personal views, he said he would support British female fighters at the 2012 Olympics.

Therefore, he is supporting **khawateen ladakey (women fighters)** despite his personal opinion.
"
Peter Lenz ki wafaat kabb hui thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Aspataal mein (Hospital mein)**

The text says he was taken to a local hospital where he later died.
"
Zeveer ziyaat kon hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Eek deegar daud laganey walaa** (Another racer).

The passage states that Paterlanz collided with Zeveer Ziyaat after falling off his bike during a warm-up. This implies that Zeveer Ziyaat was also on the track and thus, another racer.
"
Eek sayyarah key dakhli kaamon ko samajhney sey mumkanah tor parr fayedah haasil karney walaa prishaan parwaaz karney walaa kis haalt mein hoga?,"Correct Answer: **B: Aya udaan ka unkaa darr namaloom cheez key darr key aas paas markooz hay**

**Reasoning:**

*   The passage emphasizes that fear of flying can stem from the unknown and a lack of control. Understanding how planes work and what happens during flight can help alleviate this fear.
*   Option B directly reflects this point, stating that the passenger's fear is centered around the fear of the unknown.

Let's analyze why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aya mosaafir unkey darr sey sharmindah hein** The passage does mention there is no shame, but it doesn't imply their shyness is connected to how they understand what's going on with the plane.
*   **C: Aya mosaafir tamaam qism key transportation key khilaaf hein** The passage only discusses fear of flying, not transportation in general.
*   **D: Aya takleef dahh hadsaat sey tanee unki parishaani udaan sey motalliqah nahein hay** The passage is about the anxiety of air travel; this option moves away from this subject."
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail mein sey kisey qimat sey aagah mosaafir ko akhir mein karna chahiye?","The passage (P) emphasizes the following points:

*   Don't book directly with an airline without searching and comparing prices first.
*   Prices for the same flight can vary significantly on different websites.
*   It's beneficial to compare search results and **check the relevant airline's website before booking.**

The question (Q) asks what a price-conscious traveler should ultimately do based on the passage. While searching multiple travel companies and comparing prices are important steps (A & C), the final action the passage *specifically* highlights before booking is checking the airline's website.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: Airline ki website check karey** (Check the airline's website)

While comparing prices across multiple travel companies (C) is a great approach, the passage mentions checking the airline's website as the ultimate step before making the booking. So while 'C' is implied, 'D' is more explicitly stated as the final action to take."
"Ebaarat key hisaab sey, mosaafiron ko behtareen mumkanah parwaaz ki qimaton ko mahfooz karney key liye sabsey pahley kiya karna chahiye?","The correct answer is **B: Mukhtalif jamaa kunindagaan key darmiyaan qimaton ka mowaznah karein** (Compare prices between different aggregators).

Here's why:

*   The passage *explicitly* states that different websites can have different prices for the same flight and that you should **compare search results** before booking. This is exactly what option B describes.
*   Option A, ""Airline ki website check karey,"" is something that is mentioned, but it is mentioned *after* comparing prices.
*   Option C, ""Brahe raast airline key zariyah book karein,"" is explicitly stated *against* as the primary method in the passage.
*   Option D, ""Brahe raast kisi travel agent key saath book karein,"" is not mentioned in the passage.

Therefore, comparing prices from different sources (aggregators or websites) is the first step to finding the best possible fare, according to the passage.
"
Kabb kisi saathi ko kisi tarseel key saath jaana darkaar hay?,"सही उत्तर है: **C: जब चीजें चेक किए गए सामान के तौर पर भेजी जा रही हों**

यहाँ बताया गया है कि क्यों:

*   अंश में कहा गया है कि एयरलाइन के नियम यात्री के बिना सामान भेजने की अनुमति नहीं देते हैं। इससे पता चलता है कि यदि चीजों को चेक किए गए सामान के रूप में भेजा जा रहा है, तो सामान के साथ एक कूरियर को जाना होगा।

अन्य विकल्प क्यों गलत हैं:

*   A: जब चीजें मालवाहक जहाज के जरिए भेजी जाती हैं: मार्ग मालवाहक जहाज के बारे में बात नहीं करता है।
*   B: जब कंपनी अपने खुद के हवाई जहाज का इस्तेमाल करे: अंश के अनुसार, बड़ी कंपनियों के अपने हवाई जहाज हैं, लेकिन यह नहीं कहता कि कूरियर को साथ जाने की जरूरत है।
*   D: जब शिपमेंट को एक बड़ी कंपनी द्वारा संभाला जा रहा हो: पैराग्राफ में कहा गया है कि कुछ मार्गों पर बड़ी कंपनियों की अपनी योजनाएँ हैं, लेकिन यह नहीं बताया गया कि कूरियर को साथ जाने की आवश्यकता है या नहीं।"
"Ebaarat ki buniyaad parr, kisi ittehaad mein aksar parwaaz karney waali kisi airline ka intekhaab kartey waqt, darjah zail mein sey kisko tarjeeh dena chahiye?","The passage argues **against** simply choosing the airline you fly with most often. It suggests that loyalty programs within an alliance can vary significantly. Therefore, you should be looking for the airline within the alliance that offers the best rewards.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Sabsey ziyadah points peshkash karney waali airline (The airline offering the most points)** - This aligns perfectly with the passage's advice to consider the most generous rewards within the alliance.
*   **B: Baday ittehaad waali airline (The airline with a large alliance)** - The size of the alliance isn't the main consideration; it's the specific rewards offered by airlines *within* the alliance.
*   **C: Jiss airline sey aap bahut ziyadah safar kartey hein (The airline you fly with a lot)** - The passage specifically cautions against this approach without comparing benefits.
*   **D: Wohh airaline jsmein ezaafi reaayaton ka shaamil honaa mumkin ho (The airline that may include additional discounts)** - This is good, but option A is still better. You would need to consider the most points being offered within the discounts given.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Sabsey ziyadah points peshkash karney waali airline**."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kon ziyadah tarr parwaaz karney waley ki points ki peshkash kar sakta hay?","The passage says: ""ziyadah safar karnay waalon key point eek hee air line ittehad key taht kisee doosri air line key ziyadah fayyazana ho saktay hain."" This translates to: ""frequent flyer points can be more generous with a different airline within the same airline alliance.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: Usi ittehaad andar eek mukhtalif airline**
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail hawaas mein sey kon bahut ziyadah sharaab key istemaal sey maazoor ho sakta hay?","Sahi jawab hai **B: Dekhna**.

Paragraph mein wazeh taur par kaha gaya hai ke sharaab noshi ki kasrat se ""basarat se mahrumi"" (loss of vision) ho sakti hai.
"
"Ebarat mein bayan karney key motabiq, sharaab key noqsan dahh asaraat ko maharat key saath kiya cheez kam kar sakti hay?","The correct answer is **C: Etedaal key saath sharaab noshi karna (Moderate alcohol consumption)**

The passage clearly states ""Alcohal kee mashrubaat motadil tor parr pijiye"" which translates to ""Drink alcohol in moderation."" This implies that moderate alcohol consumption is a way to mitigate the harmful effects of alcohol.
"
Amsterdam ki aala key darmiyaan property ki qadrein kahaan hein?,"The correct answer is **A: Kanaal Zilaa**.

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""Amsterdam key ... kanaal zilaa (ditch: greachtengordale) ... Puray zilaa say uss kee munfarid saqafati aur tarikhi ahmiyat key liye eek unisco aalimi saqafati warsah site key tor parr namzad kiya jaataa hay, aur uss kee khaasiyat mulk kee aala aqdaar mean say eek hay.""  This clearly identifies the Canal District (Kanaal Zilaa) as a place of high value in Amsterdam.

While the other options relate to value and historical importance, the passage specifically links high value to the Kanaal Zilaa.
"
Keon kanal zilaa ko UNESCO key aalami warsah site key tor parr namzad kiya gaya hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Yehh tarikhee aur saqafati qadar hay (It has historical and cultural value)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states the canal district is nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage site because of its ""munfarid saqafati aur tarikhi ahmiyat"" (unique cultural and historical significance).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Yehh munfarid khosusiyaat hein (It has unique features)**: While the canal district has unique features, the passage emphasizes the *significance* (ahmiyat) of these features, which is linked to its cultural and historical value. The unique features are what *contribute* to the value, not the sole reason.
*   **C: Binnenstad key gard nawah ka mahalley waqoo hay (It's located near Binnenstad)**: The passage mentions it's a district around the city center, but this is descriptive, not the *reason* for the nomination.
*   **D: Aala khosusiyat ki qasar hay (It has high-quality palaces)**: While there might be nice buildings in the area, the passage doesn't specifically emphasize palaces, nor is that given as the main reason for UNESCO consideration."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon qabiley qasar Phnom Krom ka daurah karata hay?","The correct answer is **A: Tonle Sap parr nzarah**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Mandir kaa udaas maahaul aur tonlay seep jheel kaa balayi nizarah pahadi kee chadhayi ko qaabil deed banata hay"" (The temple's somber atmosphere and the upper view of Tonle Sap lake makes the hill climb worthwhile). This directly implies that the view of Tonle Sap is a reason people visit Phnom Krom.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as directly supported by the passage:

* **B: Angkor Pass ka safar karna:** The passage mentions an Angkor Pass is *required* to enter the temple, but it doesn't say it's the reason people *visit*. It's a requirement, not an attraction.
* **C: Siem Reap dekhna:** While Phnom Krom is near Siem Reap, the passage doesn't say seeing Siem Reap is the primary reason for visiting Phnom Krom.
* **D: Jheel ka kashti ka safar:** The passage mentions a boat trip makes accessing the site easier but doesn't explicitly make it a reason someone would visit Phnom Krom. It's a means of transportation, not the primary draw.

Therefore, the **view of Tonle Sap** is the most direct and accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Phnom Krom mein dakhil honay keliye daurah karney walon ko kiya darkaar hay?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: Angkor Pass parr pahunchnaa**.

The passage states: ""Mandir mean daakhil honey key liye angcor paas zaruri hay."" which translates to ""An Angkor Pass is required to enter the temple.""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Antarctica ka daurah karney sey kisi sayyaah ko darjah zail mein sey kon rok sakta hay?","Sawaal mein di gayi ibarat ke mutabiq, Antarctica ka daura karne se kisi sayah ko *bahut ziyadah safar ka bajat* aur *mahdud jismaani naqlo hamal* rok sakte hain. Ibarat mein yeh bhi kaha gaya hai ke safar sirf November-February ke darmiyan ho sakta hai, jo kaam ki miqaat bandi ko bhi ek wajah bana sakta hai. Ross Sea ki tanha dilchaspi is safar ko rok nahi sakti.

Lehaza, sahih jawab hain:

*   **A: Bahut ziyadah safar ka bajat**
*   **D: Mahdud jismaani naqlo hamal**
"
Pahaad chadhney mein dilchaspi rakheny wala eek sayyaah Antartica key kiss hissey ka daurah kar sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Zameen key andar ka elaqah (Zameen key andar ka elaqah)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically mentions ""Waqti khususi hawai safri doray, koah paimayi yaa qutub thak rasayi key liye saahil say door zameen parr jaatay hain jahaan eek wasee addah hay."" (Occasional special air travel tours go inland from the coast for mountaineering or access to the pole where there is a large base.) This directly indicates that mountaineering is done in the inland region.

The other options are less likely:

*   **A: Ross Sea:** The passage only mentions Ross Sea as a general area accessible during summer tours.
*   **C: Jazeerah numaa (Peninsula):** The passage mentions the peninsula as a place with bases and accessible to tourists, but not specifically for mountaineering.
*   **D: Jazeerey (Islands):** Similar to the peninsula, islands are mentioned as part of the accessible areas, but not specifically for mountaineering."
Tajdid sey pahley ki rasad gaah kam az kam kahaan waqea ho sakti hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Assani sey qabiley rasayi mahalley waqoo mein (Easily accessible locations)**.

The passage explicitly states that pre-modern observatories were located in cities or areas ""where they can be easily reached"".
"
Jadid tahqiq ka telescope mumkanah tor parr kahaan rakhaa hua hay?,"Correct answer is **D: Eek badi sahulat mein**

The text says that modern research telescopes are often located in remote areas with excellent environmental conditions and ""zabardast sahuliyaat"" (great facilities).  ""Badi sahulat"" translates to ""large facility"", which is the closest meaning to ""zabardast sahuliyaat"". The passage specifically contrasts these locations with the older observatories in cities or towns, thus eliminating A, B, and C.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, eek khamush sahiley samudar key dinn key liye konsa elaqah sabsey behtar hay?","Agar ebarat kay hisab sey dekhein tou, sawal mein khamosh saahiley samundar kay dinn ka zikar hay. Ebarat mein:

"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, tairaaki ki sharaaet mumkanah tor parr sabsey ziyadah mahfooz kahaan hein?","Sahi jawab hai: **B: Shumaali Harbor zilaa**

Wajah: Paragraph mein saaf tor par zikr kiya gaya hai ke Shumali Harbor zilaa mein waqe tamam reteli sahil teraki ke liye mahfuz hain. Dusre elaqon ke bare mein aisi koi wasee guarantee nahin di gayi hai.

Ebarat mein wazahat kardah mahalley waqoo ka daurah kartey waqt darjah zail mein sey kisko namonasib samjha jataa hay?,"Based on the provided text, the following are considered inappropriate when visiting the mentioned location:

*   **C: Mazaaq karnaa (Making jokes)** - The text explicitly states not to make fun of the Holocaust or Nazis.
*   **D: Kisi saakhat ko khurachnaa (Scratching a structure)** - The text explicitly states not to deface the site by marking or scratching graffiti.

The answer **B: Site key ird gird kisi jagah ki nishandahi ko chod denaa (Leaving a mark around a place on the site)** is also implied as inappropriate because the text states not to deface the site by marking it.

Option A, ""Adakari ki pokhtagi (acting maturity),"" is implied as the right action.

Therefore, all of the options except A are unsuitable behaviors, but we have to choose only one. The most explicit behavior that is seen as inappropriate from the text is ""Making jokes"".

**Therefore the best answer is C: Mazaaq karnaa**
"
Inmein sey kon lingua frank zubanon ki wazahat karta hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Gair fitri (Unnatural)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that *lingua francas* are different from natural or organic languages. *Gair fitri* (Unnatural) aligns with this distinction. Natural languages are *fitri*."
Konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr moavin zubaano ki wazahat nahein karta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: They namiyaati zubanein hein jinhein unn logon key darmiyaan mowaselat ko aasan karney key liye istemaal kiya jaata hay jo basurate deegar eek dusrey ko samajh saktey hein.**

Here's why:

*   **Passage P defines auxiliary languages as:** ""Artificial or constructed languages that have been created with the goal of facilitating communication between people for whom it would otherwise be difficult to express certain things.""
*   **Option A states:** ""They are organic languages used to facilitate communication between people who could otherwise understand each other.""
    This is incorrect because auxiliary languages are *artificial* or *constructed*, not organic/natural. The main point is that they exist to help people communicate when they otherwise *couldn't* easily, not when they already could.
*   **The other options are consistent with the provided description:**
    *   Option B is correct because they are constructed
    *   Option C is correct because they are meant for difficult communication situations
    *   Option D is correct because they are created to bridge communication gaps between speakers of different languages.

Therefore, Option A is the statement that does *not* accurately describe auxiliary languages."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, eek mosaafir ko kiss cheez ki padtaal karni chahiye agar cruise mausam sarmaa mein ho?","The correct answer is **A: Cabin ka mahalley waqoo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Agar mausam sarma mean shumali baltak paar kar rahay hain to **keeban kaa maqaam chek karein**..."" (If traveling in the North Baltic during winter, check **the location of the cabin**...).  The reason given is that the sound of ice breaking can be terrifying.

While options B, C, and D are mentioned in the passage, they are not the specific thing a traveler *should check* if cruising the North Baltic in winter.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, agar mosaafir ka cruise mosame garmaa mein ho, to wohh kiss sey bachney key qabil ho saktey hein?","Sawaal yeh puch raha hai ke agar cruise garmiyon mein hai toh ebarat ke mutabiq musafir kis cheez se bach sakte hain.

Isliye, agar cruise garmiyon mein hai, toh musafir **B: Baraf mein janaa** se bach sakte hain.

Catalan ko aksar Barcelona mein alaamaton aur elanaat key liye keon istemaal kiya jataa hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Yehh shahar ki pahli daftari zubaan thee**.

The passage explicitly states, ""keunkeh yeah zubaan qanoon key zariah pehli sarkari zubaan key tor parr tasleem kee gayee hay,"" which translates to ""because this language is recognized as the first official language by law.""  Therefore, Catalan is used more often on signs and announcements because it is the legally recognized first official language.
"
Darjah zail mein sey konsi zubaan Barcelona key Metro system key zariyah baqaedah elanaat key liye istemaal kiya jataa hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Catalan**.

The text states that ""Metro mein aam ailanat sirf kataalan mean kiye jaatay hain"" which translates to ""General announcements in the Metro are only made in Catalan.""

Therefore, the correct answers are:

*   **C: Mosame sarmaa ka Olympics**
*   **B: Andrune khanaa baraf key waqeaat waqea ho rahey hein**
*   **D: Ikhtetaami taqribaat**

However, since you need to choose **one** correct answer from the options, and the question asks what Beijing will host in 2022, the MOST encompassing and therefore best answer is:

*   **C: Mosame sarmaa ka Olympics**

Kiskey andar avian influenza key moahedah key aala tareen khatraat hein?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: Murgee key kaam** (Poultry workers).

The text states: ""Ziyadah ther logon nay aise afraad ko shaamil kiya hay jo murghi khaanah mean kaam kartay hain..."" (The majority of cases have involved individuals who work in poultry farms...).

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail konsa bayaniyah durrust tor parr bard flu ki wazahat kartaa hay?","The correct answer is **C: Prndon ki nigraani karney waley motassir honay key khatrey parr hein.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""mahireen toyoriyaat ko bhee kuchh khatra lahiq hay,"" which translates to ""ornithologists (bird experts) are also at some risk."" This is equivalent to option C, ""Bird monitors are at risk of being affected"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sirf murgee key kaam ney flu ka moahidah kiyaa hay** (Only chicken work has contracted the flu) - The passage states that *most* people affected are those who work in poultry farms, but it doesn't say they are the *only* ones. Bird experts are also mentioned.
*   **B: Parindon key moqabiley insaano mein mazeed cas ki report ki gayi hay** (More cases have been reported in humans compared to birds) - The passage implies the opposite, as bird flu is primarily a bird disease with relatively few human cases.
*   **D: Insaano mein report kiye gaye tamaam cas muhlik ho gaye hein** (All cases reported in humans have been fatal) - The passage says that *some* human cases have been fatal, not all.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate and best answers the question based on the given passage."
Safed samundar–Baltic Canal kiss sey rabetah kartaa hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Arctic samundar aur Baltic samundar**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions passports being collected on **night sleeper trains** to avoid disturbing the passenger's sleep.
*   The passage also mentions checking identity and passport on **cross border trains**.
*   The passage also mentions immigration after disembarking **ships**.

Thus, the only form of transport mentioned in the passage that does *not* involve the temporary collection of passports is **planes**. Planes do have immigration checkpoints upon arrival at their final destination, however passports are not collected and returned."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kuchh sarhad paar ki trainon parr aapki ID ki kabb jaanch ho sakti hay?","The correct answer is **D: Chalti train parr**.

The passage states: ""Kuchh sarhad paar rail gaadiyon mean chalti train mean muainah kiya jaataa hay..."" (Some cross-border trains conduct inspections on the moving train). This directly answers the question.
"
Darjah zail mein sey konsey masalah ko Singapore key ziyadah garam elaqon mein qeaam key waqt bahut mumkanah tor parr uthaana hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Garam thakan jhelnaa (Garam thakan jhelnaa)**.

The passage mentions that Singapore is hot and sunny, especially in areas located closer to the equator. This makes heat exhaustion (garam thakan jhelnaa) the most likely problem one would face.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Ghusaa hua honaa (Being angry/frustrated):** While the heat might be annoying, it's not the primary or most likely problem.
*   **B: Dukano tak rasaayi na hona (Lack of access to shops):** The passage states that it is easy to buy anything in Singapore, suggesting shops are readily accessible.
*   **D: Gumm honaa (Getting lost):** The passage states that movement in Singapore is very easy, making it less likely you would get lost."
Kon Germani pastry khaaney sey bachney key liye chahat rakh sakta hay?,"The best answer is **A: Sakht nut allergy walaa koyi shakhs (Someone with a severe nut allergy)**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that many German baked goods contain almonds, walnuts, and other tree nuts. Someone with a severe nut allergy would need to avoid these pastries.
* The other options are based on personal preference, but not a health necessity like a nut allergy."
Kis juzw ko Germani pastry kaa season walaa unsur samjhaa jataa hay?,"Correct answer is **A: Seb** (Apples)

The passage states: ""Fruit pastries aam hain, jinn mean tamaam saal pastries mean seb shaamil kiya jaataa hay"" which translates to ""Fruit pastries are common, in which apples are included in pastries all year round."" This clearly indicates apples are considered a seasonal element in German pastries.

"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail mein sey kon eek bajat parr safar karney key liye sifaarish kardah noktah hogaa?","Sahi jawab hai: **D: Khaaney aur rehaaesh jaisey ikhrajaat ko kam karnaa**

**Explanation:**

Parichched mein saaf taur par kaha gaya hai ki kam kharch mein safar karne ka ek tareeka hai apne kharchon ko kam karna. Jabki aaram ke saath naram rehna (B) bhi indirect roop se sambandhit ho sakta hai, prathmik focus kharchon ko kam karne par hai, khaas kar khane aur rehne jaise basic kharchon par. Dusre vikalp (A aur C) parichched mein diye gaye mashwareh ke virudh hain, jo gair-qanuni ya anaitik krityon mein shamil na hone ki sifaarish karta hai.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, baut kam bajat parr safar karney mein kiskey paas mushkil waqt rahaa hogaa?","Sahi jawaab hai **B: Sakht waqt ki rokawaton key begair walaa koyi shakhs**

**Explanation:**

Mazmoon ke mutabiq, kam kharch mein safar karne ke liye aaraam, waqt aur pessen goi ki qabiliyat ko qurban karna padta hai. Isliye, agar kisi ke paas waqt ki sakht pabandiyan hain, toh unke liye yeh cheezen qurban karna mushkil hoga, jiski wajah se kam bajat mein safar karna mushkil ho jayega.

Baaki options is wajah se sahi nahi hain:

*   **A: Kisi challenge ka isteqbaal karney walaa koyi shakhs:** Challenge ka isteqbaal karne wala shakhs kam bajat mein safar karne ke liye zyada mutmaeen hoga.
*   **C: Safar key doraan baeed tor parr kaam karney ka mansubah bananey walaa koyi shakhs:** Mazmoon mein yeh wazeh kiya gaya hai ke yeh option do alag alag zumron mein aata hai aur mazmoon ka focus kharche kam karne parr hai, safar karte waqt kaam karne parr nahi.
*   **D: Safar namah ki pairawi sey lutf andoz honey walaa koyi shakhs:** Safar namah ki pairawi se lutf andoz hona kam bajat safar mein koi rukawat nahi hai."
Darjah zail mein sey konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr Point Marion aur Fairmont key darmiyaan chalaaney ki wazahat karta hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Galiyaan tang hein (The lanes are narrow)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...inn raaston mean oonch neech, **tang lean** aur achanak tez mood ziyadah hotay hain."" (These roads have bumps, **narrow lanes**, and sudden sharp turns.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Door key mulk ki sadak taweel failao hay (A remote country road has a long spread)**: The passage indicates that the road passes through isolated, forested areas due to a spread between Point Marion and Fairmont, but does not state that it necessarily has a ""long spread"" itself
*   **C: Raftaar ki hadd ko shaaz w naadir manaa jataa hay (The speed limit is rarely followed)**: The passage indicates the opposite is true; drivers should abide by it.
*   **D: Cellphone ki khidmat ko masalah nahein banana chahiye (Cellphone service should not be a problem)**: This is incorrect because while cell service is *better* than in other forested areas of Pennsylvania, the passage focuses on road conditions rather than cell service issues. It does not mean there aren't problems."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Buffalo-Pittsburg highway parr safar karney waley driveron key liye inmein sey kon asal tashweesh honi chahiye?","The correct answer is **C: Bahut raftaar sey tezi sey murnaa** (Sudden sharp turns at high speed).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""inn raaston mean oonch neech, tang lean aur achanak tez mood ziyadah hotay hain."" (These roads have bumps, narrow lanes and sudden sharp turns).
*   It also emphasizes the importance of adhering to the lower speed limit (35-40 mph) due to these conditions.

The other options are incorrect based on the passage:

*   **A: Bhaari traffic mein fansna** (Getting stuck in heavy traffic): The passage doesn't mention heavy traffic. It focuses on the road conditions themselves.
*   **B: kaafi cellular khidmat ki kamee** (Lack of adequate cellular service): The passage says the *opposite* - cell service is surprisingly *good* on this part of the route.
*   **D: Aksar sadak key kaam kaa samnaa karnaa** (Frequently encountering road work): The passage doesn't mention road work."
Darjah zail mein sey kisko khayi khudaayi shuru karney ki darkaar hay?,"Sahi jawab hai: **D: Thodi miqdaar ki tarbiyat**

* **P** paragraph mein bilkul saaf likha hai ki canyoning shuru karne ke liye ""nisbatan mamuli training"" yaani thodi training ki zaroorat hai.
"
Darjah zial mein sey kon eek kamiyaab khayi khudayi safar key liye zaruri ho saktaa hay?,"Sawaal P ke mutabiq, canyoning mein teraki, chadhayi aur koodnay ke anasir shamil hain. Is ke liye nisbatan mamuli training aur jismani shape ki zaroorat hoti hai.

Is liye, sawal Q ka sahih jawab hai:

**D: Tairaaki ki salahiyat**

Tairaaki canyoning ka eham hissa hai kyunke is mein paani se guzarna shamil hota hai. Baqi options (A, B aur C) zaroori nahi hain, jabke tairaaki ki salahiyat bunyadi hai.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kisi key liye apney car mein camp karney ki mansubah bandi key liye kiya madadgaar ho sakta hay?","The correct answer is **A and B**. Here's why:

*   **A: Apni gaadi ki hodud mazboot samajh (Strong understanding of your car's limits)**: The passage explicitly states, ""Bary gaadiyon key barakas, aap shayed apni car kee driving say pehle hee waaqif hain aur uss kee hodood ko jaantay hain"" (Unlike large vehicles, you are probably already familiar with your car's driving and know its limits). This is presented as an advantage of car travel/camping.

*   **B: Neechey letney key liye seaton ki ijaazat deney waali eek gaadi (A car that allows seats to lie down)**: The passage mentions that car camping is possible if you have a vehicle with seats that allow a person to lie down. The passage states, ""Car camping Usee soorat mean mumkin hay jab tumhare paas mini vein yaa sport utility vehicle yaa seeden yaa station vegan jis mean aisi seetein hone jinn purr aadmi lait sakay."" (Car camping is only possible if you have a minivan, sports utility vehicle, sedan, or station wagon that has seats on which a person can lie.)

*   **C: Eek tent (A tent):** The passage does not mention a tent to plan car camping.

*   **D: Camp karney key liye niji jaedaad (Private property to camp on)**: The passage mentions that camping on private property might attract unwanted attention which is not helpful.

Therefore, understanding your car's limits and having a car with seats that recline are helpful for planning a car camping trip, according to the passage.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, car camp karney waley agar radaar key taht qeaam karney key liye dekh rahey hein to wohh kiss sey bachna chahtey hein?","The correct answer is **C: Shahar yaa kisi niji jayedaad parr koyi tent set karnaa**.

The passage states that setting up camp on private property or in a town of any size attracts unwanted attention (""gair matlub tauajjah ko jalb karnaa hay""). Therefore, car campers looking to stay under the radar would want to avoid this.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kisney Casablanca ko dobarah fir sey tameer kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Marakash ka sultaan**.

The text mentions that ""Marakash key sultan nay iss shehar ko daar albadiyah key naam say dobarah tameer kiya..."" which translates to ""The Sultan of Marrakesh rebuilt the city under the name Daar al-Baida.""
"
Casablanca key jadid shahar ko eek qudrati tabaahi key baad kisney khaali kiya tha?,"The correct answer is **B: Portugaali**

The passage states: ""Purtagali nay uss ko tabaah karr diyaa aur kaasa branka key naam say usay dobarah tameer karwaya, sirf 1755 key zalzalay key baad usay chhodnay key liye.""

This translates to: ""The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casablanca, only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.""

Therefore, the Portuguese abandoned Casablanca after a natural disaster (the earthquake).
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, bairuni logon key darmiyaan Sintra ney kaisey pahchaan haasil ki thee?","The correct answer is **C: Lord Byron key musbat jayezey**.

The passage states that Sintra became popular with foreigners ""after a brilliant compilation of its splendor and grandeur recorded by Lord Byron."" This directly translates to positive reviews by Lord Byron.
"
Armenia ney kisko tasleem nahein kiya hay?,"Sawaal P ke mutabiq, ""taham, koyee bhee musalmah mulk - hatta kehh arminia bhee bazabtah tor parr usay tasleem nahein karta hay. Uss khittay key baaray mean sfarti ikhtelafat say arminia aur aazarbaijan key maabain taluqat badastur kharab hain."" Yeh jumla batata hai ke Arminia ney ""nayi jamhuria"" ko tasleem nahein kiya hay.

Isliye, sahih jawaab hai:

**D: Naya jamhuriyah**
"
Azerbaijan aur Armenia key darmiyaan talluqaat ko konsi cheez mosalsal motassir karti hay?,"The passage states: ""Uss khittay key baaray mean sfarti ikhtelafat say arminia aur aazarbaijan key maabain taluqat badastur kharab hain."" This translates to: ""Diplomatic disputes over this region continue to damage relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Safarati bahsein (Diplomatic disputes)**. While the other options are related to the conflict, the passage specifically mentions diplomatic disputes as the *ongoing* factor affecting relations.
"
Charlotte mein taxi letey waqt konsi cheez ezaafi charge ka sabab ban sakti hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Teen mosaafiron ka haamil honaa**.

The text states that there is a fine for having more than 2 passengers in a taxi in Charlotte. Therefore, having three passengers would lead to an extra charge.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, bachchon key saath Charlotte mein rahney key liye kisey kam tarr samjha jataa hay?","The correct answer is **B: taxi lenaa (taking a taxi)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that taxis are not commonly used in Charlotte and can be expensive for families due to passenger limits and potential fines. This makes them a less desirable option.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Ghar ki qimatein (Home prices)**: The passage doesn't mention home prices as a drawback for families.
*   **C: Deegar elaqon key bashindagaan (Residents of other areas)**: The passage suggests that families from other areas move *to* Charlotte, indicating it's a positive aspect.
*   **D: Shahar sey lutf andoz honay ki koshish karna (Trying to enjoy the city)**: The passage states that visitors often find it easy to enjoy the city with children, so this is not considered a negative."
Haspaniyon ki aamad sey pahley kon Chile key shumaali hissah ko control karta thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Mapuche**

The passage clearly states: ""16vin sadee mean jab desi araukiniyon (mapuche) key wastee qur jonubi chiqlee mean abad they hispanvi logon kee aamad say qabal, shumali chilee parr inn kee hukumat thee.""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, dajah zail mein sey kon 1810 mein kiya waqea hua thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Chile ney aazadi ka elaan kar diya thaa** (Chile declared independence).

The passage states: ""Agarcha chili nay apni aazadi kaa elaan 1810 mean kiya..."" (Although Chile declared its independence in 1810...)
"
Log Liguria key khittah mein door draaz key gaon tak kaisey pahunch saktey hein?,"Correct answer is **C: Train yaa kashti key zariyah**

The passage states:

*   ""guzar gaahein, trainein, aur kashtiyan nawazaat ko jodti hain"" (paths, trains, and boats connect the villages)
*   ""aur baahir say kaarein inn thak pahunch nahein saktein"" (cars from the outside cannot reach them)

This clearly indicates that access is possible via trains and boats, but not cars."
Itli ki istelaah ‘Cinque Terre’ ka matlab kiya hay?,"Sawal ke mutabiq, ""Cinque Terre, jaiska matlab paanch zaminein hain"".

Is liye, sahi jawab hai:

A: Paanch gaon

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss qism ki kashti mumkanah tor parr fislan waley mosamey sarmaa ki surate haal keliye mauzoon hay?","Sawal mein diye gaye ibarat ke hisaab se, darj zel option mein se sahih jawab chunen:

P: Mausam sarma mein haadson ka sab se aam sabab phisalnay waale raastay, foot paath aur bator khaas zeenay hain. Aapko kam se kam munasib talon waale jooton ki zaroorat hogi - aam tor parr mausam garma ke jotay barf aur zalah baari mein bahut phisalte hain, yahaan tak ke mausam sarma ke jootay bhi nakafi hotay hain - Namoona kaafi gehra hona chahiye, 5 milli meter (1/5 inch) ya uss se zayed, aur mawaad ko sard darjah hararat mein kaafi naram hona chahiye. Kuchh booton mein ghandiyan ya keelein hoti hain aur phislan waale halaat ke liye jootay mein pewast izaafi aalah bhi hay jo ziyadah tar jooton aur booton, edee aur edee ke saath soul ke liye munasib hay. Heals ko nichla aur chodaa hona chahiye. Reet, gaaray ya namak (calcium chloride) ko aksar sadkon ya guzargahon parr bikhera jaata hay taakeh mazbuti ko behatar banaya jasakay.

Q: Ebarat ke hisaab se, kiss qism ki kashti mumkanah tor parr fislan waley mosamey sarmaa ki surate haal ke liye mauzoon hay?

A: Tang heels waali kashtiyaan
B: Juday huey saazo saamn waali kashtiyaan
C: Oonchey heels waali kashtiyaan
D: 1/5 inchi gahrey namooney ke bagair kashtiyaan

Sahi jawab:

Ibarat mein saaf tor par zikar kiya gaya hai ke ""Heals ko nichla aur chodaa hona chahiye"" aur ""Namoonah kaafi gehra hona chahiye, 5 milli meter (1/5 inch) ya uss se zayed."" Is se zahir hota hai ke 1/5 inch gahrey namooney ke bagair kashtiyaan fislan waale mausam sarma ke liye mauzoon nahin hain.

Lekin, diye gaye options mein se koi bhi kashti ki sahih khasiyat ko zahir nahin karta jo fislan waley halaat ke liye mauzoon ho. Options jooton ki heals aur namoonon ke bare mein hain, na ke kashtiyon ke bare mein.

Is liye, sab se qareebi jawab (agarcheh sahih nahin hai) **D: 1/5 inchi gahrey namooney ke bagair kashtiyaan** hai, kyunkeh yeh ibarat mein diye gaye isharay ke khilaaf hai ke namoonah gehra hona chahiye. Lekin, yeh zehen mein rahe ke yeh aik ideal jawab nahin hai.

Inmein sey kon Mosame sarmaa key halaat key doraan baraf ki sadkon parr krishn ko behtar bananey mein madad nahein karegaa?,"Sawaal ka jawaab **D: Paani** hai.

Daleeleye:

P: Mausam sarma mean haadson kaa sab say aam sabab phisalnay waale raastay, foot paath aur bator khaas zeenay hain. Reet, gaaray yaa namak (calcium chloride) ko aksar sadkon yaa guzargahon parr bikhera jaataa hay taakeh mazbuti ko behatar banaya jasakay.

Reet, gaaray aur namak teeno ko mazbuti ko behatar bananey key liye istimaal kiya jaataa hai. Paani phislan ko badhaata hai, isliye yeh sadak parr grip ko behatar bananey mein madad nahein karegaa."
Darjah zail mein sey kiska Hawaii aur Cook jazeeron key darmiyaan durust momasil hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Wohh eek hi waqt key mintaqah ka ishteraak kartey hein** (They share the same time zone).

The passage states, ""Hawai kee hee tarah eek hee time zone waale yeah jazeeray..."" (Like Hawaii, these islands are in the same time zone...).

The other options are incorrect based on the passage:

*   **A: Unn dono mein bahut sey badey hotel hein** (They both have many large hotels): The passage implies Cook Islands *lacks* large hotels, unlike Hawaii.
*   **B: Unn dono key paas riyaasat ka darjah nahein hay** (They both don't have state status): Hawaii *does* have state status.
*   **D: Unn donno mein koyi shahar nahein hein** (They both have no cities): Cook Islands have no cities, passage doesn't mention about Hawaii."
Darjah zail mein sey kon durust tor parr Cook jazeeron ki wazahat karta hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Jazeerah walaa mulk Hawaii ki tarah eek hi waqt key mintaqah ka ishteraak karta hay** (Island nation shares the same time zone as Hawaii).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Hawai kee hee tarah eek hee time zone waale yeah jazeeray... (Like Hawaii, these islands have the same time zone...)""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yehh Hawaii sey chotta hay** (It is smaller than Hawaii) - The passage says, ""Agarcha yeah chhota hay, leakin yeah hawai (hawaii) key chand buzurg dorah kaaraan ko riyasati haisiyat say qabal baday seyahati hotels aur deegar taraqqiyati kaamon key baghair iss kee yaad dilata hay. "" (Although it is small, it reminds some older visitors of Hawaii before statehood without the large tourist hotels and other development projects.) This does NOT say explicitly that it's smaller than Hawaii, but rather implies it is less developed than Hawaii USED to be.
*   **B: Yehh eek jazeerah numa hay** (It is a peninsula) - The passage calls it ""bahrujazair"" which means archipelago which is a chain of islands.
*   **C: Asal shahar Rarotonga aur Aitutaki hein** (The main cities are Rarotonga and Aitutaki) - The passage says, ""Cock jazair mean koyee shehar nahein hay, balkeh yeah 15 mukhtalif jazeeron kaa majmuah hay. inn mean ahem rartonga aur aayito taaki hain."" (There is no city in the Cook Islands, rather it is a collection of 15 different islands. Among these, Rarotonga and Aitutaki are important.) This states it is not a city, but rather an island.

Is ka matlab hai ke Sirena do qism ke rehaaeshi ikhteyaraat (camping aur mushtarka kamrey) ki peshkash karta hai.

Is liye, sahih jawaab hai:

A: Sirena
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, credit key bajaye raqam istemaal karney keliye agar aap chahtey they to park ki ijazat ko aap kahaan mahfooz kar saktey they?","Sahi jawab hai **B: Puerto Jiménez**

Text mein saaf taur par kaha gaya hai ke ""Pewarto jamineez mean ranger station say baraah raast park permits haasil karnaa mumkin hay, magar woh credit cards qabool nahein kartay."" Yani, Puerto Jiménez ranger station par credit card ke bajaye naqad raqam se ijazat li ja sakti hai.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kis qism ki skiing ko ziyadah steep khittah mein kiya jataa hay?","Sawal ke mutaabiq, ibarat mein wazeh tor parr zikr kiya gaya hai ke alpine style ski tour yaa koah paimayi ziydah dhalwan khittay mein ki jati hai. Isliye, durust jawaab hai:

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, mulk key himayat yaaftah ski karney walon ki kia cheez madad kar sakti hay jo mazeed ziyadah raftaaron tak pahunchna chahtey hein?","The passage states: ""kabhi kabhaar hee aap tayaar kardah tracks mean baghair bhaari beak peak key contry skiing kee raftaar haasil kar payein gay."" This means you can rarely achieve the speed of country skiing without prepared tracks.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Tayyar track** (Prepared track).
"
Dobarah dakhil honey waley sadmah ka samnaa karney waley musaafiron key paas kiya krney key liye sakht waqt hota hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Apni ghareloo saqafat sey az sirey naw mowafiqat karnaa** (Readapting to their home culture).

The passage explicitly states that re-entry shock can make it difficult for travelers to readapt to their home culture. It highlights the irony that those who easily adapted to a foreign culture might struggle to readapt to their own.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, dobarah dakhil honay walaa sadmah khaas tor parr kis qism key mosaafir key liye mushkil ho sakta hay?","The correct answer is **B: Bairune mulk rahney key waqt fauri tor parr motabiqat karney waley mosaafir hazraat**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""woh sayyaah jinhein nayey tehzeeb wo tamaddun akhtiyar karnaa waqat key lehaaz say aasaan rahaa ho kabhi kabhaar unhein apni tehzeeb ko dobarah akhtiyar karnaa mushkil hojata hay."" This directly translates to: ""Those travelers who found it easy to adopt a new culture and civilization may sometimes find it difficult to re-adopt their own culture.""
* **Re-entry shock is being discussed:** The entire passage revolves around the difficulties of re-entry shock.  The ease of adapting initially (making them quickly ""motabiqat"" or adaptable) is what makes re-entry harder.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Khosusi tor parr buri saqafat key sadmay ka samana karney waley mosaafir hazraat:** While experiencing bad culture shock can be difficult, the passage emphasizes the *opposite* – those who adapted easily initially.
* **C: Abb bhi suhaag raat key marhalah mein rahney waley mosaafir hazraat:** While the passage mentions the honeymoon phase, it's used to illustrate that re-entry shock happens *after* the honeymoon phase, not during it.
* **D: Kam saabir mosaafir hazraat:** While patience is generally helpful, the passage's central point is about the *ease of initial adaptation* being the key factor.

Therefore, the passage directly links the difficulty of re-entry shock to travelers who adapted quickly and easily to the foreign culture. So, B is the correct answer.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kiya kaam logon ko moose key saath karney sey bachna chahiye?,"Sahi jawaab hai **A: Apni mojoodgi ko nazar andaaz karna.**

Diyay gaye bayan (P) ke mutabiq, moose jarhana nahi hotay magar apna difaa kartey hain agar khatray ka ehsaas ho. Agar log unhein khatarnaak nahi samajhtay aur unkay qareeb jatay hain, to woh khud ko khatray main daaltay hain.

Isliye, apni mojoodgi ko nazar andaaz karna yaani moose ki taraf aisi harkat karna jaisay woh wahan nahi hain, ek khatarnak amal hoga. Baqi options (B, C, aur D) sabhi moose ke saath interact karte waqt khayal rakhnay ke tareeqay hain.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, moose key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sahee nahein hay?","Sawal ka matlab hai: Moos ke baarey mein in mein se kaun sa bayan durust nahin hai?

*   **A:** Yeh bayan durust nahin hai. Paragraph mein wazeh taur par kaha gaya hai ke moose fitri tor par jaarehana nahin hote.
*   **B:** Yeh bayan durust hai. Paragraph mein kaha gaya hai ke kuch log moose ko khatarnak nahin samjhte.
*   **C:** Yeh bayan bhi durust hai. Agar moose ko khatre ka ehsaas ho toh woh khud difaa karein gay, isliye qreebi qurbat mein logon se unhein muharrak kiya ja sakta hai.
*   **D:** Yeh bayan bhi durust hai. Paragraph mein wazeh taur par kaha gaya hai ke moose khud difaa karein gay agar unhein khatre ka ehsaas ho.

**Isliye, sahih jawab A hai.**"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon eek sahrayi mosaafir key liye kam az kam khatarnaak hoga?","Sahi jawab hai: **A: Eek thandi raat ko garam kapday ki kami**

Iski wajah yeh hai:

*   **A: Eek thandi raat ko garam kapday ki kami:** Ebarat mein wazeh tor par bataya gaya hai ke registan raat ko intehayi sard ho sakte hain aur garam kapdon ke baghair hypothermia eek haqeeqi khatra hai. Isliye, yeh eek khatarnak soorat-e-haal hai.

*   **B: Paani ka dhokah denay waley saraab ko dekhanaa:** Saraab khud mein khatarnak nahi hai. Khatra tab shuru hota hai jab musafir is per yaqeen karta hai aur iske peeche bhaagta hai.

*   **C: Saraab ka taaqub kartey waqt taqat zayah karnaa:** Saraab ka peecha karne mein taqat zaya hoti hai, jo ke mushkil hai, lekin direct hypothermia jitni khatarnak nahi.

*   **D: Saraab ka taaqub kartey waqt paani zayah karnaa:** Saraab ka peecha kartey waqt paani ka zaya hona eek bada masala hai aur jaan lewa bhi ho sakta hai kionkay registan mein pani ki kami hona intehayi khatarnak hai.

Isliye, kam az kam khatarnak soorat-e-haal woh hai jab sirf saraab nazar aaye (lekin us per yaqeen na kiya jaye aur uska peecha na kiya jaye).
"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko sahrayi mosaafiron key liye eek mumkanah khatrah key tor parr zikr kiya jataa hay?,"Sahi jawab hai **A, B, aur C**.

Peraagraf mein wazahat key saath zikr kiya gaya hai kay:

*   **Saraab:** Musafiron ko paani ka dhoka hota hai aur woh saraab ka peecha kar sakte hain.
*   **Hypothermia:** Raat mein shiddat ki thandak se hypothermia ka khatra hota hai.
*   **Paani ki kami:** Saraab ka peecha karne se baqi paani zaya ho sakta hai, jo paani ki kami ka sabab banta hai.

Suraj ki sozish ka zikr peraagraf mein nahi hai, lekin woh bhi sahrayi musafiron key liye aik khatrah hosakta hai. Lekin, jo peraagraf mein bataya gaya hai, us key hisaab se, sahi jawab **A, B, aur C** hay."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, daryaaft kunindagan ki aamad key baad kis jamaat ki aabadi ziyadah motassir hui thee?","The correct answer is **C: Taínos**.

(Shortly after the arrival of European explorers, the **Taíno** population significantly decreased due to the Spanish conquerors.) and ""Fray Bartolome de las Casas mein 1492 se 1498 tak rehney waale spiny fateheen nay taqriban 100,000 taaye no logon ko qatal kiya.""

"
Dobarah takhliqi sargarmi key tor parr skiing ko mashhoor karney ka credit kis ko diya ja sakta hay?,"Correct answer is **B: Norwey key log**

**Reason:**

The passage states: ""1861 mean pehla tafrihi sky club norway key baashindon nay australia mean khola thaa."" This directly indicates that people from Norway are credited with opening the first recreational ski club, which contributed to popularizing skiing as a recreational activity.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss waqt key ird gird khel key tor parr skiing ko sabsey pahley taslim kiya gaya thaa?","The correct answer is **D: 17vein sadi**.

The passage states, ""Down hill skiig khel kaa rewaj kam wo baish 17vein sadee mean shuroo huwa,"" which translates to ""Downhill skiing as a sport started around the 17th century.""

Darjah zail mein sey kon aam tor parr mashriqi afriqi saahil key sabsey baday jazeerey key saath wabastah hay?,"Sawal ke mutabiq, Mashriqi Afriqi saahil ke sabse bade jazire (Madagaskar) ko ""jab baat jungli hayat kee aatee hay to woh bazaat khud eek barre aazam hay"" kaha gaya hay.

Isliye sahi jawab hai:

**C: Jangali zindagi**
"
Ziyadah chotey mashariqi afriqi jazeeron ki kiya khosusiyat nahein hay? ,"Correct Answer: C: Jangli zindagi ki shohrat

Reasoning:

The passage states that smaller East African islands are either independent countries or affiliated with France and are known for luxury beach resorts. Madagascar is described as being large and like a ""mini-continent"" in terms of wildlife. This implies that the smaller islands *aren't* particularly known for their wildlife. The other options are all characteristics mentioned in the passage about the smaller islands.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kuchh khaas tor sey rewayati churchon ki jaanib sey Easter kaisey manaya jataa hay?","The correct answer is **B: Sanichar ki eek raat ki nigraani ki mezbaani karnaa**.

The passage states that ""Aksar taqlidi church easter kee taateel mean shanbah kee raat shab bedari kartay hain"". This translates to ""Often traditional churches hold vigils on Saturday night during the Easter holiday"". Therefore, hosting a Saturday night vigil aligns with how traditional churches celebrate Easter, according to the passage.

The other options are less accurate based on the text:

*   **A: Eek zarkhezi ki rewayat ka haamil honaa:** While the passage mentions the possibility of a pre-Christian fertility ritual origin, it doesn't say that traditional churches *specifically* celebrate Easter with that in mind.
*   **C: Jamaat key liye eek bahaar party karnaa:** The passage doesn't mention a spring party.
*   **D: Toluey aaftab dekhnaa:** While the passage mentions watching the sunrise on Easter night, it's mentioned as a separate tradition, not necessarily something done by all traditional churches.
"
"Makhsus zaruriyaat sey bachney key liye Ecuador mein dakhil hotay waqt, Cuba key eek shahari ko sabsey pahley kiya haasil karnaa zaruri hay?","The correct answer is **B: Eek qanooni dawat namah ka khat**

The passage states: ""Ekwador chahta hay kehh cuba key baashinde ekwador mean daakhil honey say qabal ... eek dawat namah vasool karein."" (Ecuador wants Cuban citizens to obtain an invitation letter before entering Ecuador).
"
Ecuador key safar ki zaruriyaat kia hein jiskey liye usey design kiya gaya hay?,"The passage states: ""Yeah sharaet iss liye waza kee gayee hain taakeh donon mulkon key maabain mohajireen kee aamad wo raft ko monazzam kiya jaa sakay."" (These conditions have been created in order to regulate the flow of migrants between the two countries).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: Eek monazzam muntaqili key bahao ko bahaal karnaa** (To restore an organized migration flow).
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon watan key moqabiley mein kisi doosrey mulk mein ziyadah qimati ho sakti hein?,"The correct answer is **B: Aala asal key framez (High-end branded frames)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that ""aala brand key naam key fremon mein do dushwari hosakti hay kuchh dastak band ho saktay hain, aur asl daraamadaat baraamadaat karnay waali jagah say ziyadah mahngi hosakti hain."" This translates to ""High-end branded frames in such regions can have two difficulties: some may be counterfeit, and genuine imports can be more expensive than in the original exporting location.""

The other options are either mentioned as potentially cheaper (eye exams at home) or not specifically addressed in terms of comparative cost."
Kisi khariji mulk mein aala asla key framez khareedney kaa kiya mumkanah khatrah bann sakta hay?,"The passage states: ""Iss tarah key elaqon mean dastiyaab aala brand key naam key fremon mean do dushwari hosakti hay kuchh dastak band ho saktay hain, aur asl daraamadaat baraamadaat karnay waali jagah say ziyadah mahngi hosakti hain.""

This translates to: ""In such areas, there are two potential problems with high-end brand name frames: some may be discontinued, and genuine imports may be more expensive than in the original import/export location.""

Therefore, the most relevant risk of buying high-end frames in a foreign country, particularly a low-income country, is that some may be discontinued or more expensive, and also implicitly that they could be fake.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Eek ezaafi aankh ki jaanch darkaar ho sakti hay (An additional eye exam may be needed):** The passage does mention getting an eye exam at home, but this is related to saving money, not a risk of buying frames abroad.

*   **B: Makhsus framez key liye tashkhees ho sakta hay jayez na ho (Prescriptions may not be valid for specific frames):** This isn't directly stated in the passage. While possible, it's not the primary concern highlighted.

*   **C: Wohh naqli ho saktey hein (They may be fake):** This is a plausible risk. The passage implies potential issues with the authenticity or quality of high-end frames in these locations. Since the passage speaks to original imported materials being more expensive than expected, it suggests the possibility of fakes.

*   **D: Yaqeen dahaani ho sakta hay qimat ka ehaatah na kar sakey (Insurance may not cover the cost):** The passage mentions insurance coverage for eye exams, but not for the frames themselves purchased abroad. So, while true that insurance might not cover the cost, it is not the answer that is best supported by the passage.

**Therefore, the best answer is C: Wohh naqli ho saktey hein (They may be fake).** This is the most probable risk associated with buying high-end frames in foreign, low-income countries, based on the passage's implications about discontinued or more expensive items which implies also the possibility of fakes.

Falklands mein currency key istemaal key baaey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah dururst nahein hay?,"Sahi jawab hai: **B: Stanley tanha eek aisi jagah hay, jahaan ameriki dollar qobool kiye jaatey hein**

Wajah:

*   Bayaniya A ghalat hai kyunkeh matn mein kaha gaya hai keh baheri jazeeron mein credit card qabool nahin kiye jaatey hain. Bartanwi pound, albatta, qabool kiye jaatey hain.
*   Bayaniya B ghalat hai kyunkeh matn kehta hai keh ameriki dollar aksar qabool kiye jaatey hain, jis se pata chalta hai keh yeh sirf Stanley tak mehdood nahin hain.
*   Bayaniya C durust hai kyunkeh matn mein yeh wazeh tor parr kaha gaya hai.
*   Bayaniya D durust hai kyunkeh matn mein kaha gaya hai keh bartanwi pound jazair mein aam tor parr manzoor kiye jaatey hain."
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, America sey Falklands mein safar kartey waqt, kahaan credit car ki ba nisbat adayegi ki deegar shakal khaas tor parr mofeed ho sakti hay?","Correct Answer: C: Bairuni jazeeron mein

The passage specifically states that credit cards are ""unlikely to be accepted on the outer islands."" This makes cash (British pounds, Euros, or US dollars) a more useful form of payment on the outer islands.
"
Konsa waqea mandir key teohaaron key jashan key saath wabasta nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Eek haathi ki paidaesh (An elephant's birth)**.

The passage mentions the following events associated with temple festivals:

*   Temple anniversary
*   Deity's birthday
*   Other major events associated with the temple

An elephant's birth is not mentioned as an event that is celebrated during temple festivals."
Mozayyan haathiyon ko kahaan dekhaa ja sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Mandir key tehwaron key jolus mein (Mandir festivals processions)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states ""...Keral key dilchasp mandiron key melay dekhnay key laiq hain, iss mean sajaye hoay haathiyon kaa joloos nikala jaataa hay..."" (The interesting temple fairs in Kerala are worth seeing, in which a procession of decorated elephants is taken out). This directly links decorated elephants to temple festival processions.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon karobaar yaa pahely darjah key hawyi keraye parr paisah mahfooz karney key kaa sabsey ziyada mumkanah tariqah hay?","The correct answer is **A: Apni company mein isko kharch karnaa**.

Here's why:

*   **The Passage's Argument:** The passage clearly states that business and first-class tickets are expensive and that airlines are unlikely to offer discounts on direct flights for these classes. It also explicitly suggests that a business traveler might have their company pay for the ticket.

*   **Analysis of Options:**

    *   **A: Apni company mein isko kharch karnaa:** The passage mentions having the company pay as a way to ""take out a thick wad of money"" without personally bearing the cost, making this the most likely way to ""save"" money from the individual's perspective.
    *   **B: Karobaar key bajaye pahley darjah ki booking karna:** The passage specifies that first class costs *more* than business class, so this would not save money.
    *   **C: Eek bilwastah pahley darjah ki parwaaz book karnaa:** The passage explicitly mentions considering discounts on direct flights. Indirect flights are irrelevant and may not be suitable for people looking to save time while traveling to somewhere.
    *   **D: Koyi reaayat talaash karnaa:** The passage says it's unlikely to find discounts for business or first-class on direct flights, making this a less promising option.

Therefore, the passage suggests getting your company to pay is the most viable way to effectively ""save"" money on these expensive tickets."
"Ebaarat key hisaab sey, makhsus keraye ke darjon ko book karnay key waqt ko talaash krney key liye ziaaye waqt kiaa hogaa?","The passage explicitly states: ""Aam baat karein to karobar yaa eek jagah say doosri jagah keliye braah raast parwazon key frist cliss keliye **chhoot parr ghor karnay kee bhee wajah nahein hay**."" This directly implies that looking for discounts on first-class tickets for direct flights is a waste of time.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **C: Reaayatein (Discounts)**"
Duniya bharr key kerayah key saath Africa kull kerayah key iqtebaas ka mowazenah kartey waqt kiss cheez ko shaamil karney zarurat nahein hay?,"Sawal pooch raha hai ke jab duniya bhar ke kirayey ke saath Africa ke kull kirayey ka mawazna kartey waqt kiss cheez ko shamil karney ki zarurat nahin hai.

Di gayi maloomat ke mutabiq, Africa se bahar ke maqamat ke liye ezaafi visa ki qimat, rawangi mahsulaat, aur zamini naql wo hamal waghairah ke izaafi ikhrajat ko shamil karna hai.

Isliye, sahih jawab hai:

**C: Africa key visa ki qimat**

Kyunki hum duniya bhar ke kirayey se mawazna kar rahe hain, to hamein sirf Africa se bahar ke maqamat ke liye visa ki qimat ko shamil karna hoga, na ke Africa ke visa ki qimat ko.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, supermarket kiss cheez key mazeed motanawwah intekhaab ki peshkash shuru kar rahey hein?","The correct answer is **A: Tayyar khana**.

The passage states: ""Taksiri andaaz mean super markets tayaar shudah khaaney key bahut see qasmein farokhat kartay hain"" which translates to ""In an extensive way, supermarkets sell many kinds of prepared foods"". This directly supports the idea that supermarkets are offering a more diverse selection of ready-made foods.
"
Baaz supermarket ki jaanib sey faraham kardah konsi sahulat saarif ko tayyaar khana kharidney key liye ubhaarti hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Eek microvave choolha** (A microwave oven).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Taksiri andaaz mean super markets tayaar shudah khaaney key bahut see qasmein farokhat kartay hain- yahaan thak kehh khaana garam karnay keliye kuchh to micro view aween yaa deegar wasail bhee farahim kartay hain."" This directly says that supermarkets sometimes provide microwaves to heat up food.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Site parr resturaan (Site Restaurant):** While the passage mentions some supermarkets have restaurants, it's not presented as a *universal* feature that encourages buying ready-made food.
*   **B: kam motanawwah intekhaab (Limited Selection):** A limited selection would *discourage* buying ready-made food.
*   **C: Kachcha khana (Raw food):** Raw food is not ready-made and would require cooking.
"
Darjah zail mein sey konsi baat fransisi bolney waley belgium aur swiss key logon ki jaanib sey ho sakta hay kehh nahh samjha gaya ho?,"Let's break down the passage and the question to find the best answer.

*   **The Passage:** The passage highlights that Belgian and Swiss French are slightly different from French spoken in France. These differences mainly involve the accent, minor grammar quirks, and pronunciation of some words. However, the passage also emphasizes that all French speakers in Belgium and Switzerland learn standard French in school and can understand it.

*   **The Question:** The question asks: ""Which of the following *might not* be understood by French-speaking Belgians and Swiss?""

Now let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Standard French number system:** The passage says they learn standard French. The number system is a fundamental part of the language, so they would definitely understand it.
*   **B: Peculiar French words:** The passage indicates that one of the differences between French spoken in Belgium/Switzerland and French spoken in France are ""some"" words. So this is a potential source of misunderstanding.
*   **C: Particular pronunciations of French words:** The passage specifically mentions that the pronunciation of some words is different. This aligns perfectly with a possible source of misunderstanding.
*   **D: Most French speakers in France:** This is irrelevant to their understanding of French. Whether most French speakers are in France is a geographic fact, not a linguistic hurdle.

**Comparison and Conclusion:**

Between options B and C, C is the stronger answer. The passage mentions distinct pronunciations as a core difference. While ""peculiar French words"" could be misunderstood, the *pronunciation* is explicitly identified as a variance.

**Therefore, the correct answer is C: Particular pronunciations of French words.**"
Darjah zail mein sey kon france mein usy tarah nahein hay jaisaa kehh wohh belgium aur Switzerland mein hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Number walaa system**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** Specifically, the **number system** in French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland has some minor peculiarities that make it different from the French spoken in France and some words are also pronounced differently.

The passage also explains that standardized French is taught in schools and that speakers from all regions can understand each other. It doesn't mention anything about differences in the spelling of French words.
"
Kiss manzar namah mein aap ko mumkanah tor parr sog key kerayah ki peshkash nahein ki jaati hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Agar aap Lufthansa ko paris sey America tak udaa rahey hein**

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** Lufthansa offers bereavement fares for flights originating from the US and Canada only. A flight from Paris to America would not qualify.
*   **The other options:**

    *   **A: Agar aap magribi tayyarah udaa rahe hein:** WestJet (Magribi tayyarah) is mentioned as an airline that offers bereavement fares.
    *   **B: Agar aap freeqe saalis ki khidmat key bajaye airline sey brahe raast book karney ki koshish kartey hein:** The passage explicitly states you *must* book directly with the airline to get a bereavement fare.
    *   **D: Agar aap Delta ko udaa rahey hein:** Delta is listed as an airline that offers bereavement fares."
Sog key kerayon key barah mein kiya durust hay?,"Sawaal mein diye gaye passage ke mutaabiq, sahih jawaab hai:

**D: Unhein lazmi tor parr baraahe raast phone key zariyah airline sey book karnaa hogaa**

Passage mein saaf taur parr kaha gaya hai, ""Tamaam muamilon mein, aap ko laazman air line say phone key zariah braah raast book karwana chahiye.""
"
Standalone GPS aalah ka istemaal kabb GPS gashti app sey ziyadah aasan hogaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Jabb aap hadd sey bahar ja rahey hon**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** GPS apps on smartphones are useful for navigation abroad *unless* you don't have a data connection or are out of coverage. In those situations, their functionality is limited or unavailable.
* **This implies:** When you anticipate being out of data coverage (""hadd sey bahar ja rahey hon""), a standalone GPS device (which doesn't rely on a data connection) would be a more reliable and therefore *easier* option.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: jabb aap paisa bachaney ki koshish kar rahey hein**: The passage initially presents smartphone GPS apps as a cost-saving method, so a standalone GPS isn't the better option when trying to save money.
*   **B: Jabb aap ko yaqeen ho kehh aap key paas data connection hogaa**: If you're confident you'll have a data connection, the smartphone app is presented as the easier and more convenient option.
*   **D: Jabb aap kisi aalah ko kerayah parr lenaa chahtey hon**: The original passage suggested that using a GPS app in your phone would save on money from rental fees or purchasing standalone GPS navigation devices.

"
GPS gashti app istemaal karney key liye konsi achchi wajah nahein hay is tor parr kehh wo standalone aalah key khilaaf ho?,"Sawaal puch raha hai ke GPS gashti (navigation) app istemaal karne ki woh kaunsi achchi wajah nahi hai jo standalone aalah (device) ke muqable mein ho. Yani, woh kaunsi cheez hai jo standalone GPS device mein behtar hai, GPS app ke muqable mein.

*   **Pura Paragraph:** Paragraph mein wazeh tor par bataya gaya hai ke GPS apps ko data connection ki zarurat hoti hai, aur agar data connection nahi hai ya phone hadd-e-mawasilat se bahir hai to woh sahi se kaam nahi karenge.

Is liye, sahi jawab hai:

*   **A: Data connection key baarey mein parishaan honey ki zarurat na honaa** (Data connection ke bare mein pareshan hone ki zaroorat na hona)

Standalone GPS device ko data connection ki zaroorat nahi hoti, jabke GPS app ko hoti hai. Baaqi options (paisa bachana, kerayon sey bachna, naye naqshon ko kharidney ki zarurat na honaa) GPS app ke faide hain, nuqsan nahi.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, aap kaisey yehh garanty dey saktey hein kehh aap monasib jahaaz key moshabah hein?","The correct answer is **C: Galapagos key safar mein takhsis haasil karney waley kisi agent key saath book karna**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Aap yaqeen karein kehh jis agent say aap book karwatay hain woh goalpagoz kaa maher hay jis key paas bahut qism key jehazon kee achhi malumat hay. Yeah iss baat co yaqeeni banaye gaa kehh aapki khususi dilchaspiyan aur / yaa rukawatein unn keliye sab say mozoon jehaaz key saath mel khaa gayee hain."" This means that booking with an agent specialized in Galapagos trips and knowledgeable about the different ships is the key to finding the right match for your interests and needs.
*   The other options aren't directly supported by the passage as guarantees of finding a suitable ship:
    *   A: Momasil dilchaspiyon waley 8+ mosaafiron ki jamaat mein book karnaa: While traveling with like-minded people can be enjoyable, it doesn't guarantee the ship itself will be a good fit for your specific interests or limitations.
    *   B: Kam season key doraan book karnaa: Booking during the off-season might improve availability, but it doesn't ensure the ship will be a good match.
    *   D: Bahut peshgi book karnaa: Booking well in advance increases your chances of getting a spot on any ship, but it doesn't guarantee that ship will be the best choice for you."

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss cheez sey eek maahir juwari ko bachna chahiye?","Sahi jawab hai:

**A: Bahut ziyadah sharaab pinaa**

Ibarat mein saaf taur par kaha gaya hai ke ""tamaam achhay joey baaz hosh mean rehney kee ahmiyat co jaantay hain."" Iska matlab hai ke ek mahir juwari ko bahut ziyadah sharab pine se bachna chahiye kyunki sharab noshi faislah saazi ko kharab karti hai.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kalaam ka konsa hissa jumlah key darmiyaan bada horoof hota hay?","The correct answer is **B: Asmaa**.

The passage explicitly states that nouns (asmaa) always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence. The other options are not mentioned as following this capitalization rule.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsi cheez asmaa key bady horoof honey ko ziyadah mushkil bana sakta hay?","Correct answer is **C: Likhna**

The passage says: ""Iss say bahas talab tor parr, padhna bhee aasaan hojata hay, halankeh tehriri tor parr yeah bahut mushkil hay..."". This directly translates to: ""This arguably makes reading easier, although in writing it is very difficult..."".

Therefore, according to the passage, writing is what makes capitalizing nouns more difficult.
"
Malaysia key dehee hisson mein kis isharay ka matlab “Aaiye” hota hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Haath hilanaa**.

The passage clearly states: ""Lakin maleshiya, yaa cum az cum dehati malayayiyon key darmiyan, iss key maanee """"aa jaiye"""" key hain."" which translates to ""But in Malaysia, or at least among rural Malaysians, it means """"come here"""".
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss esharey ka matlab “wapas aaiye” ho sakta hay?","The correct answer is **A: Hatheli andar ki taraf dikha kar esharah karna**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lekin maleshiya, yaa cum az cum dehati malayayiyon key darmiyan, iss key maanee """"aa jaiye"""" key hain. bilkul usee tarah jaise kehh angushti shahadat say esharah kiya jaataa hay."" This implies that the ""hello"" wave (which typically involves the palm facing outwards) is interpreted as ""come here"" in rural Malaysia.

Later the passage mentions, ""span mean eek bartanvi musafir wapas aaney key esharay key tor parr (bajaye iss parr kehh uss shakhs co alwedaa kahaa jaye) hatheli kaa saamna karnaa shaamil kartay hoay kisee co alwedaa karnay mean ghalti karr sakta hay."" This confirms waving with the palm facing inwards is similar to a ""come here"" gesture.

Therefore, based on the text, waving with the palm facing inwards can be misinterpreted as ""come here"".
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, shagafon ki kiya wajah ho sakti hay?","Sawaal me glazeearon ki harkat se hone wali shagafon ki wajah poochhi gayi hai. Paragraph me saaf taur par likha hai ki ""Glaciers paydar nahein hotay hain, lekin pahaad key neechey behtay hain. iss say surakh, gehrey shagaaf hotay hain, ju barf kee chatanon say dhak jaatay hain.""  Iska matlab hai ke glacier ki harkat, yani ki ""Gair mustahkam glacier"", shagafon ki wajah hai.

"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, kiss mahalle waqoo ka daurah karney sey pahley mosaafiron ko ezaafi ehteyaat karnaa chahiye?","The correct answer is **B: Goma key gardo nawah key elaqey** (Goma's surrounding areas).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Agarcha Goma maqool hadd thak mahfuz hay, taham Goma say baahir kisee bhee qism key doron parr shumali Cueve soobay mean jaari ladayi kee haalat co samajhne key liye tehqiqat honey chahein.""

This translates to: ""Although Goma is reasonably safe, any type of excursion **outside of Goma** should be researched to understand the state of ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province."" This directly advises extra caution when traveling in the areas surrounding Goma.
"
Darjah zail mein kon Goma mein kisi sayyah keliye achcha noktah nahein ho sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Shumaali Kivu ki ladayiaan tafreeh faraham kar rahi hein.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that if you plan to venture outside of Goma, you should do research to understand the ongoing conflict in North Kivu province. This clearly indicates that the fighting is *not* a source of entertainment and is something to be aware of and potentially avoid.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Yehh sastey pahadi Gorilla ki suraag rasaani key liye eek achchi jagah hay** - The passage mentions Goma as a base for tracking mountain gorillas in Africa.
*   **C: Motorcycle taxiyaan gardo nawah mein jaaney keliye achcha zariyah hay** - The passage mentions ""boda-bodas"" (motorcycle taxis) as a way to get around Goma.
*   **D: Nyiragongo aatish fashaan ki buniyaad shahar mein waqea hay** - The passage mentions Goma as a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo."
Agast mein ibtedayi dinn key liye mulk ki himayat yaaftah ijazat kabb dastiyaab hogi?,"The correct answer is **B: 1 Aprel**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that permits become available ""four months prior to the starting month on the first of the month.""
*   The question asks about a permit for ""August"".
*   Four months before August is April.
*   Therefore, the permit would become available on April 1st."
Wadi ka tahaffuz karney key liye konsi policy jagah parr hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Ejazaton ki eek mahdood tadaad (A limited number of permits)**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ejazat naamay waadi kee hifazat thak mahdud hain..."" This directly implies that the permit system exists to limit access and protect the valley.  The passage also says, ""Permits kee eek mahdud taadad walk inn darkhwaston key liye reserve hay...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eek pahley aao, pahlaa mahfooz ijazat ka system (A first-come, first-served permit system)** While a *portion* of the permits are first-come, first-served (for walk-ins), the *overall* system isn't purely first-come, first-served, as many permits are obtained through advance reservations.
* **B: Ijazatein sirf 1 januri ko dastiyab hein (Permits are only available on January 1st)**  While permits for some dates become available on January 1st, the passage doesn't say that's the *only* time permits are available.
* **C: Ijazatein sirf darkhawast lekar jaaney key zariyah haadil kiya ja sakta hay (Permits can only be obtained by taking an application)** The passage mentions both reservations and walk-in applications, indicating that's not the *only* way to obtain a permit.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon kam az kam mumkanah tor parr ebarat mein bayan kardah hotlon ki qism mein paaya jataa hay?,"Sahi jawab hai: **D: Jadid aala darjah waley tajdid shudah haaliyah kamrey**

Wajah:

Paragraph mein yeh bataya gaya hai ke hotels mein ""Qadeem tarz kee lawazmaat, jadeed tareen sahuliyaat aur kuchh khaas shandar pairanah kee kamee bhee unkay kirdaar key hisssay hain"". Iska matlab hai ke hotels mein qadeem style ki cheezain aur jadeed sahuliyaat toh hongi, lekin shandar pairanah (yani old-fashioned hona) kam hoga. Option D, ""Jadid aala darjah waley tajdid shudah haaliyah kamrey"" is concept se contradictory hai, kyunki yeh ek modern touch ki baat karta hai, jabke paragraph ke mutabiq in hotels mein qadeem aur jadeed cheezon ka combination hota hai, lekin shandar pairanah kam hota hai. Isliye, yeh kam az kam mumkina option hai.

Baki options (A, B, aur C) paragraph mein bataye gaye hotels ke characteristics se milte julte hain:

*   **A: Eek cocktail bar:** Hotels mein raat ki zindagi ka zikar hai, jismein cocktail bar ho sakta hai.
*   **B: Eek site parr petoo resturaan:** Paragraph mein ""umdah khaaney"" ka zikar hai, jiska matlab hai ke hotels mein achhe restaurants honge.
*   **C: Aisey saathi mehmaan jo qabiley shanakhat key liye mashhoor hein:** Paragraph mein ""mashur zamana aur ameer log"" ka zikar hai, jo in hotels mein rukte the."
"Ebarat mein pesh kardah malumaat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail pesh kashon mein sey kisko hotel key mehmaan kam az kam mumkanah tor parr tarjeeh dengey?","Sawaal ke mutaabiq, woh hotels mashhoor zamana aur ameer logon ki mehmaan nawazi karte they, umdah khaaney pesh karte they aur raat ki zindagi guzartay they. Unmein qadeem tarz kee lawazmaat aur jadeed tareen sahuliyaat bhi hoti theen. Is bunyaad par, ek ameer musafir sastey kamron ki qimaton ko sabsey kam tarjee deyga.

Isliye, sahih jawab hai:

**D: Sastey kamron ki qimatein**

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Mosaafiron key Greenland ka daurah karney sey kis cheez sey bacha ja sakta hay?","The correct answer is **D: Bator eek “Eskimo” Greenland key eek maqami bashindah sey roju karnaa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Agarcha aap green land key maqami afraad kee jaanib say iss lafz kaa istemaal sunain, taham gher mulkiyon co iss key istemaal say ijtanaab bartana chahiye."" This means that tourists should avoid using the term ""Eskimo"" when referring to the local Greenlanders.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage states that in Greenland, even in towns, there are no ""bad areas"", meaning you don't have to worry about high crime rates in specific areas. The passage does not say you should avoid high crime areas.

*   **B:** The passage says the opposite: ""Agar aap sardi key mausam mean green land kee seyahat karnaa chahte hain... laazim hay kehh aap kaafi taadad mean garam kapday lay jayein."" You need to bring warm clothes, especially in winter.

*   **C:** While the passage does mention spotty internet connectivity, it does not say you should avoid working there as a traveller."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon Greenland ka daurah karney waley gair tayyar mosaafiron key liye ziyadah mumkanah tor parr masalah walaa hotaa hay?","The passage clearly states that the cold weather is the only real danger an unprepared individual might face. While it mentions Nordic mosquitoes in the summer, it describes them as annoying but not disease-carrying. Crime and unfair treatment are stated as practically unknown. Local people are not a problem.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Mosam** (Weather).
"
Markazi plaza key tor parr darjah zail mein sey kisko abb istemaal kiya jataa hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

The passage states: ""Yeah abb markazi plaza key toor purr com karta hay"" (It now functions as a central plaza). ""Yeah"" refers to the Jardín de la Unión mentioned at the beginning of the passage. Therefore, Jardín de la Unión is the central plaza.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kisko Jardín de la Jamaat mein nahein payaa jaa sakta hay?","The answer is **D: Eek purani convent ki emaarat**.

Here's why:

*   **P** states that the Jardín de la Unión was built as the atrium of a convent in the 17th century. However, it is not an old convent building. The only remaining building of that style is Templo de San Diego.
*   **P** states that there's a gazebo where concerts are often given.
*   **P** states that the restaurants surround the garden.
*   **P** states that Callejon del Beso is the home of an old love story."
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, dinn key paidal safar key baarey mein darjah zail mein sey konsa bayaniyah na durust samjha jayegaa?","The correct answer is **D: Dinn ka paidal safar bachchon waley khandaano key liye eek monasib bahari sargarmi nahein hay** (Day hiking is not a suitable outdoor activity for families with children).

The passage states, ""Chhote bachon waale ahal khaanah cow ziyadah tayariyon kee zaroorat padsakti hay, leakin bachon our pre-school key bachon key saath bhee eek rozah out doors aasani say mumkin hay"" (Families with young children may need more preparation, but day outdoors are easily possible even with children and pre-school children). This directly contradicts option D, making it the incorrect statement.  The other options are supported by the text.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, eek din key paidal safar ko bahut kam tayyari ki kabb zarurat hoti hay?","The correct answer is **B: Jabb ismein ziyadah aasan pagdandi shaamil ho** (When it involves a more easy trail).

The passage states: ""Eek dunn key izaafe key liye eek aasaan trial our thodi see tayariyon kee zaroorat hay..."" which translates to ""A day hike requires an easy trail and a little preparation..."" This indicates that an easier trail reduces the amount of preparation needed.
"
Norway key baaqi ki banisbat Rogaland yaa Agder key plateau key baarey mein mukhtalif kiya hay?,"Sawaal mein Rogaland aur Agder ke plateau ke baare mein poochha gaya hai. Passage mein kaha gaya hai ki ""Rojaland our agder mean inhein aam toor purr """"hayee'' kahaa jaataa hay jis kaa matlab hota hay baghair darkhat waale morland ju khalanj say dahkay hotay hain.""

Is se pata chalta hai ki Rogaland aur Agder mein plateau aam taur par baghair darkht waale morland hote hain jo khalanj (heather) se dhake hote hain.

Is liye sahih jawab hai:

**D: Unkaa aksar heather mein ehaatah hota hay** (Un ka aksar heather mein ehtata hota hai)
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon Norway keliye aam nahein hoga?","The correct answer is **B: Jangalaati plateau**.

Here's why:

*   **P** states that common features of Norway are deep places and valleys that rise to high or lower plateaus (plato). These ""plato"" are described as vast, treeless spaces.
*   **P** Also mentions ""heier,"" which are treeless moorlands covered in heather, common in certain regions.
*   **Q** Asks which of the following wouldn't be common in Norway

*A* *Zameen ki khuli tausee* - Open expanses of land: This aligns with the description of plateaus as vast, open spaces

*B* *Jangalaati plateau* - Forested plateau: The passage specifies that the plateaus are *treeless*, making this uncommon.

*C* *Khadee fjords* - Deep fjords: This aligns with the description of deep places in the passage.

*D* *Moorlands*: This aligns with ""heier"" being common in areas of Norway.

Therefore, forested plateaus are NOT a common feature described in the text."
Skiing mein dilchaspi rakhaney waaley sayyaon ko pahadi station kaa daurah kabb karnaa chahiye?,"The correct answer is **A: Mosame sarmaa key doraan**.

The passage states that many hill stations experience good snowfall in winter, leading to peak activities like skiing and snowboarding. Therefore, tourists interested in skiing should visit during the winter season (""Mosame sarmaa"").
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, aam tor parr kabb ziyaadah tarr sayyah pahadi station parr hotey hein?","Correct Answer: C: Hindustani mosame garma key doraan

Translation: The passage states that hill stations see peak tourism during the Indian summer season.
"
agar aap madad ki talaash karney waali kashti milney ki tawaqqo karr rahey hein to aap ko kiya karney sey bachna chahiye?,"The passage (P) advises you to talk to as many people as possible in the marina, share information, offer help, and advertise your services (looking for crew, help with port preparations, etc.). The goal is to make connections and find a boat that needs help.

Question (Q) asks what you should AVOID if you're trying to find a boat looking for help.

The best answer is **D: Saathi kashti ka safar karney walon ko nazar andaaz karnaa (Ignoring fellow boat travelers)**.  The entire passage emphasizes the importance of talking to and connecting with other boaters. Ignoring them would be the opposite of what's recommended.
"
Madad ki darkaar kisi kashti ko talaash kartey waqt aap ko marinas key gardo nawah mein kiya karnaa chahiye?,"Based on the passage (P), the correct answer is:

**A: Jahaaz raano key saath rabetah karein (Contact the sailors)**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""baar mean jehaaz raanon say raabtah karnay kee koshish karnay waghairah key silsilay mean aap elaan lagayein gay."" (You will make announcements in connection with trying to contact sailors in the bar etc.). This indicates establishing contact with sailors is important for finding a boat needing help.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: radar key taht qaem rahein (Stay under the radar):** The passage promotes being communicative and visible, the opposite of staying ""under the radar.""
*   **C: Logon key apney yaat ko saaf karney key waqt sirf unn tak pahunchney ki koshish karein (Try to reach only those who are cleaning their own yachts):** While finding someone cleaning a yacht might be useful, the passage emphasizes networking with as many people as possible, not limiting contact.
*   **D: Saathi safar karney walon sey bachein (Avoid fellow travelers):** The passage directly advises the opposite: meeting and sharing information with fellow travelers."
Jazeerah key samraaji taarikh mien dilchaspi rakhney waley kisi sayyah keliye konsa mahalle waqoo dilchasp hogaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Shumaali saahil**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hong Kong jazeeray kee shehri tamirat kee eek kaseer taadad kee bharmaar shamali saahil key saath mojud qaabli istemaal banayi gayee zameen purr hay. Yeah woh jagah hay jasay bartanvi samrajiyon nay apna banaa lia thaa our asee tarah agar aap elaqah key nawabadiyati maazi kaa sobut talaash kirr rahay hain, too iss kee sharoaat karnay key liye yeah eek achhi jagah hay.""

This translates to: ""A large number of Hong Kong Island's urban constructions are on the usable land along the north coast. This is the place that the British imperialists made their own, and as such, if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.""

Therefore, the north coast (Shumaali saahil) is the location of interest for a tourist interested in the island's imperial history.
"
Shaandar manazir ko tarjeeh deney waley kisi sayyah key liye konsa mahalle waqoo dilchasp hogaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Kowloon waterfront**.

The passage states: ""Hong cong kaa behtareen nazarah karnay key liye jazirah co chhodo our iss key bilmaqabil colon water front purr jaao."" This translates to ""To see the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront opposite it.""
"
Rukaab mein fansey ksisi sawaar key pair key khatrey ko kam karney mein madad karney walee kuch zeenon mein kiya hota hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Hifaazati salaakhein** (Safety bars).

The passage states that ""baaz zeenon bilkhusus english zeenon mean seifty baar lagi hoti hay jasay agar garnay waala sawaar peeche say kheenche to rakaab kaa chamda zeen say alga hokar gurr jaataa hay."" This directly translates to ""Some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars, so that if a falling rider pulls back, the stirrup leather comes away from the saddle and falls.""

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Tang talvey** (Narrow soles) - While the passage mentions that riders wear riding boots with specific sole types to minimize the risk, the passage does not say this feature exists on the saddle itself.
*   **C: Chamdey ki rukabein** (Leather stirrups) - The passage refers to leather stirrups, but only says they can detach from the saddle in saddles with safety bars.
*   **D: Azeem tarr istehkaam** (Greater stability) - While stirrups provide stability, the passage doesn't state that saddles with safety measures are inherently more stable."
Sawaar honey waley jutah ki konsi khosusiyat sawaar ki hifaazat ko rukaab istemaal kartey waqt badhaney mein madad karti hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Eek aedi (A heel)**.

The passage states: ""ziyadah ther sawaar sawari key aise jootay pehantey hain jis mean lambi eedhi how, hamwaar how, kaafi tang how our tanha how.""  This directly mentions that a heel is a feature of riding boots that helps with safety.
"
Mehmaan nawazi tabadlah ke network key zariyah mosaafiron ko kiya pesh kash ki jaati hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Maqami mezbaano key saath rehaeshein** (Accommodations with local hosts).

The passage clearly states that hospitality exchange networks connect travelers with local residents in the cities they are visiting, implying that the main offer is accommodation at the homes of these residents.
"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, mehmaan nawazi key tabaadlah network key baarey mein darjah zail konsa bayaniyah sahee nahi hay?","The correct answer is **A: Mosaafiron ko hamesha maqami mezbaano key hawaley faraham kiye jaatey hein.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that lists of available hosts *sometimes* include references and reviews from other travelers. It does *not* say that references are *always* provided.

The other options are directly supported by the passage:

*   **B: Kuch network mein mosaafiron ki ezaafi tasdeeq darkaar hoti hay** - The passage explicitly mentions that some networks offer or require additional verification.
*   **C: Mosaafiron ko manzil shahar mein dastiyaab mehmaan nawazon ki eek fihrist faraham ki jaye gee** - The passage states that a list of available hosts is provided, either in print or online.
*   **D: Baaz auqaat mosaafiron key liye maqami mehmaan nawazon key jayezey dastiyaab hotey hein** - The passage says that sometimes lists include references and reviews from other travellers.

Therefore, option A is the statement that is *not* accurate based on the provided text."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss qism ka mehmaan kam az kam mumkanah tor parr kisi hotel key mushtarekha kamrah mein paya jata hay?","The correct answer is **C: Chotey bachchon key saath safar karney walaa eek mehmaan**.

The passage explicitly states that families with children are rarely seen in hostels, although some hostels allow them in private rooms. This indicates they are the least likely type of guest to be found in a shared hostel room.
"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, hastal mein kiskey thaharney ka bahut ziyadah imkaan hay?","P: Hostels bilkhusus naujawanon - bees salah umar waale khaas mahmanon kee mezbani kartay hain - leakin aap ko vahan dosray musafir bhee mill jayein gay. Bachon key saath khandaan shaaz wo naadir dekhnay ko miltay hain leakin kachh hostels private kamaron mean inn ko ajazat deetay hain.

Translation: Hostels especially cater to young people - especially guests around twenty years old - but you will also find other travelers there. Families with children are rarely seen, but some hostels allow them in private rooms.

Q: Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, hastal mein kiskey thaharney ka bahut ziyadah imkaan hay?

Translation: Based on the passage, who is most likely to stay in a hostel?

A: Naw molood key saath safar karney walaa eek jodaa (A couple traveling with a newborn)
B: Teen 22-saalah safar karney waley eek saath (Three 22-year-olds traveling together)
C: Apney 70vein mein eek jodaa (A couple in their 70s)
D: Apney bachchon key saath safar karney waley do khandaan (Two families traveling with their children)

Based on the passage, hostels especially cater to young people around twenty years old. Families with children are rarely seen. Therefore, the most likely option is:

**B: Teen 22-saalah safar karney waley eek saath** (Three 22-year-olds traveling together)

In do bayanaat ke mad-e-nazar, hum yeh nateeja akhaz kar saktey hain kah sirf kuch boomerang waapas aney ke qaabil hain. Is liye sahih jawab **D: Sirf kuch boomerang waapas honey key qaabil hein** hay.
"
Buniyaadi tor parr darjah zail mein sey kon Javanese kaana mein istemaal hoti hein?,"The correct answer is **C: Nariyal ki shakkar (Nariyal ki cheeni)**

The passage explicitly states ""...jinn key mashhur zaiqon mean moong phalee, march, cheeni (khaas tor purr jawiyani key naril kee cheeni)..."" indicating that coconut sugar, specifically Javanese coconut sugar, is a distinctive flavor element in Javanese cuisine.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, koyi motaddi beemari kaisey failti hay?","The correct answer is **B: Pathogen**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Mutaadi marz wah bemari hay ju marz key awamil kee wajah say hoti hay, jaise wires, bacterium, fungus yaa deegar tafili jaraseem."" This translates to: ""An infectious disease is a disease caused by disease agents, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, or other parasitic germs.""

*   The word ""marz key awamil"" refers to pathogen, which means any organism that can produce disease.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Motassirah log (Infected people)** - Infected people spread a contagious disease, but the infection *itself* is *caused* by a pathogen.
*   **C: Bacterium** - Bacterium is *one type* of pathogen, but not the only way infectious disease spreads.
*   **D: Vaccination** - Vaccination *prevents* infection, it does not cause it."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kisi motaddi beemari key sabab bananey key liye kiya mashhoor nahein hay?","The passage states that infectious diseases are caused by ""wires, bacterium, fungus yaa deegar tafili jaraseem"" (viruses, bacteria, fungus or other parasitic germs). Vaccination is mentioned as a requirement for travelers, but not as a cause of infectious diseases.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Vaccination**.

kis manzar naamah mein zaati VPN parr kisi web proxy ka intekhaab karnaa saarif key liye kaafi hogaa?,"Sahi jawab hai **C: Saarif buniyaadi tor parr http traffic ka rastah badal rahaa hay**

**Samajh:**

* **Paragraph ka maqsad:** Paragraph VPN ke fawaid bata raha hai web proxy ke muqable mein, jaise ke tamam internet traffic ko redirect karna, better bandwidth, aur security.
* **Sawwal:** Sawwal puch raha hai ke kab ek web proxy VPN se zyada kaafi hoga.
* **Jawab C ki tashreeh:** Agar saarif ko sirf HTTP traffic ko redirect karna hai, toh ek web proxy kaafi hoga. VPN HTTP traffic ke saath saath sabhi traffic ko redirect karta hai, jo ke tabhi zaroori hai jab saarif ko poori privacy aur censorship ko bypass karna ho.
* **Other options ki tashreeh:**
    * A: Agar saarif tamam traffic ka rastah badalna chahta hai toh VPN behtar hoga.
    * B: Censorship aur jasusi sey bachne ke liye VPN behtar hai.
    * D: Aala satah bandwidth ke liye VPN behtar hai.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, VPNs aur web proxy key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sahee nahein hay?","The correct answer is **D: VPNs sirf http traffic ka rastah badal sakta hay**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Wah sarf each tea tea pie http kaa hee nahein, balkah internet key tamaam traffic kaa naya rasta banatay hain."" This directly contradicts option D, which claims VPNs only reroute HTTP traffic. The passage clearly says they reroute *all* internet traffic.

The other options are supported by the passage:

* **A: VPNs aam tor parr web proxy sey ziyaadah aala bandwidth ki pesh kash karta hay:** The passage says, ""wah aam toor purr aaliya bendoth our khadmat kaa behtarmayar pesh kartay hain"" (they generally offer higher bandwidth and better quality of service).
* **B: Web proxy tamaam web traffic ka rasta nahein badal sakta:** The passage says, ""wah sarf each tea tea pie http kaa hee nahein, balkah internet key tamaam traffic kaa naya rasta banatay hain,"" implying that web proxies *only* reroute HTTP traffic and not all web traffic.
* **C: Web proxy mein VPNs ki ba nisbat kam tarr khidmat ka meyaar hota hay:** The passage says, ""Mutadid wajuhaat kee banaa purr wah web proxy say barter hain,"" which translates to ""For multiple reasons, they are better than web proxies"" along with, ""wah aam toor purr...khadmat kaa behtarmayar pesh kartay hain"", indicating that VPNs provide better quality of service compared to Web proxies.

Apney fauri elaqay sey baahar kisi phone ki company ka istemaal karney kissi shakhs ko kiya ijazat deti hay?,"The passage states that calls travel via the internet, so you don't need to use a local phone company or even live in the area code your number shows.

"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, makhsus kalein wosul karney keliye kis cheez ki zarurat ho sakti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Eek aalami number kharidein**.

The passage states: ""Aksar aap cow eek aalimi number alga say kharidna padta hay ju aap key liye pie ees tea een phone say call karnaa mumkin banata hay.""  This directly translates to ""Often you have to buy a global number separately, which makes it possible for you to call from a PSTN phone."" This confirms you need a global number to receive specific calls from a PSTN phone.

Darjah zail mein sey kon durust tor parr itli zubaan key alfaaz key talaffuz ki wazahat nahein karti hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Ziyadah tar alfaaz ka talaffuz darjah zail horooge ellat ki buniyaad parr mukhtalif hota hay** (Most words are pronounced differently based on the following vowels).

Here's why:

* **P** states that *only* the letters 'c' and 'g' have pronunciations that change based on the following vowels.  The statement in option D implies this is true of *most* words, which contradicts P. The remaining options are true about the passage.
* **A** It is true that double 'r' is pronounced differently than single 'r' from the passage provided.
* **B** It is true that most words are pronounced the same as they are written, according to the passage.
* **C** It is true that the letters 'c' and 'g' may cause difficulty since their pronuncations vary, according to the passage."
Izmir ki darjah zail konsi khosusiyaat jadid zamaanah sey pahley paida hui theen?,"Correct Answer: **None of the options are correct**.

None of the options are from ancient times.
The only structure mentioned that would be from ancient times is the old mosques and churches.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon Izmir ki durust Khosusiyat nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Mahaul rewayati turkii ki akkasi karta hay**.

The passage specifically states that Izmir gives off a ""Mediterranean European"" vibe and *not* a traditionally Turkish atmosphere. The other options are all mentioned in the passage as characteristics of Izmir.
"
Hanami lafz kiss cheez key nazarah kaa hawalah deta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Cherry khilti hay**.

The passage states that ""Cheery blasam ko dekhna, jasay hanami kahaa jaataa hay..."" which translates to ""Viewing cherry blossoms, which is called hanami..."" This directly links Hanami to the viewing of cherry blossoms.
"
Cherry key khilney ka nazarah karney key liye waqf pahli dawaton ki mezbaani kisney ki tee?,"The passage states: ""Japan mean pehli cheery blazam partiyon kee ziyafat shahanshah faqat apnay liye our shahanshahi darbar key gird woo pesh key arkaani ashrafiya key liye karta thaa.""

This translates to: ""In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were hosted by the emperor only for himself and the aristocracy associated with the imperial court.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Japan key shahanshah** (Japan's emperor).
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, yrroshalam ka darjah zail konsa marhalah kam az kam seyahat ki targeeb deney key liye mumkin hay?","The correct answer is **B: Israel key darul hokumati shahr ka iska darja**.

Here's why:

The passage states explicitly that *many* other countries and the UN do *not* recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Therefore, this status is a *negative* factor in encouraging tourism, not a positive one. The passage highlights the religious significance, historical sites, and cultural offerings of Jerusalem as major attractions for tourists.
"
Darjah zail mein sey konsa ebarat mein iss tor parr mazkoor nahein hay kehh kiss cheez key liye yarroshalam mashhoor hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Seyasi asaro rosukh (Political influence)**.

The passage mentions Jerusalem's captivating history, religious significance (for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), and cultural sites. It does *not* explicitly mention that Jerusalem is famous for its political influence. Although the passage does state there is disagreement on its capital status, that doesn't necessarily translate to broad ""political influence.""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss qism key mosaafir ko jangali card kharidney sey fayedah nahein hoga?","The correct answer is **B: Eek mosaafir jo sirf Kruger qomi Park ka daurah karr raha hay**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that a Wild Card is beneficial for those who want to visit *a selection* of South African parks, *or* all South African national parks.
*   Therefore, a person only visiting Kruger would not benefit from the Wild Card, as it covers more than just that single park.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** Someone visiting as many SANParks as possible *would* benefit from the Wild Card.
*   **C:** A budget traveler concerned about park fees *would* likely find the Wild Card beneficial if they plan to visit multiple parks.
*   **D:** Someone visiting Kruger and at least one other park *would* benefit from the Wild Card."
Konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr Kruger qomi Park ki wazahat nahein karta hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Yehh jonubi Africa key qomi parkon mein sabsey chota hay (It is the smallest of South Africa's national parks).**

The passage states Kruger National Park is a very important attraction and is 19,500 square kilometers in size. It doesn't say it is the smallest, and based on the size mentioned, it's unlikely to be the smallest. The other options are directly supported by the text.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon pahad key ziyadah khadey hisson parr chadhney walon key liye sabsey ziyadah khatarnaki ki wajah bananey ka imkaan hay?,"The passage says, ""beegi haalat mein ziyadah chhachlay hissoon mein utarnay say ahtiyaat karein kiyon kahh yeah alee alfoor khatarnaak ho sakta hay.""  ""Alee alfoor"" is likely referring to a slippery condition, so ""tarr surate haal"" (wet conditions) is the biggest danger on steep parts.

Therefore, the answer is A: Tarr surate haal
"
Darjah zail konsa bayaniyah ebarat mein wazahat kardah Machu Picchu pahaad ki chadhaayi ki durust tor parr akkaasi karta hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Tarr honay key waqt ziyadah khadey hissey khatarnaak ho jaatey hein.**

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states: ""...or bhegi haalat mean ziyadah chhachlay hasoon mean utarnay say ahtiyaat karein kiyon kahh yeah alee alfoor khatarnaak ho sakta hay"" which translates to ""...and be careful descending on steeper sections in wet conditions, as it can be very dangerous"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Neez fit chadhney walon ki bhee saans band honaa mumkin hogaa:** (Even fit climbers are likely to be out of breath.) While the passage mentions breathing might be difficult, it doesn't say that *even* fit climbers will definitely be out of breath. It's implied, but not directly stated as a certainty.
*   **B: Ziyadah khaday hisson mein koyi handrail nahein hein:** (There are no handrails in the steeper sections.) The passage says ""dhalwan waale hissoon mean steel key taar maawin daston kaa kaam kartay hain"" (steel wires serve as supporting handles in the sloping sections), implying handrails/support is present.
*   **C: Aap ko choti par kisi gaar key zariyah guzarna zaruri hay:** (You need to pass through a cave at the top.) The passage describes a small house near the summit that needs to be *entered*, not a cave. It states ""Choti key qareeb eek chhota saw ghar mojud hay jasay abur kiya jaana zaruri hay""

Therefore, option D is the only one that accurately reflects a direct statement from the provided text."

Here's why:

*   **A: Geothermal hangi bartan garam karney key liye aag sey garam pattharon ka istemaal kartey hein:** The passage states that hangi are heated either by fire-heated rocks *or* by geothermal heat. So, some geothermal hangi might use fire-heated rocks.

*   **C: Bhuna hua raat ka khana aksar hangi istemaal kartey huey pakaya jaata hay:** The passage explicitly says ""Rawayati angithi tarz purr raat kaa khaana pakanay keliye aksar haingi kaa istemaal kiya jaataa hay""

*   **D: Geothermal hangi ko Rotorua mein paya ja saktaa hay:** The passage explicitly mentions ""Rotovrah mean mutadid maqamat zamini haandi pesh kartay hain"".

*   **B: Hangi ka garam patthar istemaal karnaa Wellington mein dastiyaab nahein hay:** The passage mentions that examples of hangi can be found ""christ church, wellington our kahein our say namunay liye jaa saktay hain"", it doesn't exclude Wellington as a location where hangi with heated rocks can be used."
Darjah zail mein sey kisko hangi bartan garam karney key liye aam tariqah key tor parr zikr nahein kiya gaya hay?,"सही जवाब है:

A: गैस

पैराग्राफ स्पष्ट रूप से गर्म पत्थरों और भूतापीय गर्मी को हंगी बर्तन गर्म करने के सामान्य तरीकों के रूप में बताता है। गैस का उल्लेख हंगी को गर्म करने के तरीके के रूप में नहीं किया गया है।
"
Kis cheez ki wajah sey kisi rahib ya raahibah ki taraf sey khosusi shanakhat hoti hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Eek chamakdaar dhanka hua lehaaf odhna**.

The passage states, ""...lekin agar aap apni chaadar, khaas tor purr chamakdar rangon waali laatay hain, to darwazay purr rahib yaa rahibah maskarahat key saath aap kaa kheer muqadam karay gee."" This directly translates to: ""...but if you bring your own shawl, especially one with bright colors, the monk or nun at the door will greet you with a smile."" This implies that bringing a brightly colored shawl will cause the monk or nun to especially notice you and greet you warmly.
"
Darjah zail mein sey konsey kapday ki ashyaa mumkanah tor parr kisi khanaqaah sey udhaar leney key liye dastiyaab nahein hay? ,"The passage states that women can borrow shawls (chaadrein) if they are unprepared, and men can borrow trousers (pyjama) to cover their ankles. The passage does not mention that skirts or lehaaf are available to borrow.

Of the options provided:
*   Skirts are mentioned as what women are required to wear (below the knee).
*   Trouser are mentioned as what men can borrow.
*   Lehaaf are not mentioned.
*   Short are not mentioned.

Therefore, the answer is lehaaf.

**Final Answer: D**"
Antarctic elaqon ka daurah kartey waqt kabb eek mosaafir key paas sitaron ko dekhney key liye sabsey ziyadah mawaqey hotey hein?,"Sawal P mein bilkul wazeh taur par kaha gaya hai ke ""agar aap mausam sarma mein Arctic ya Antarctica ke ilaqaon ka daurah karte hain, aap polar night ka tajurba karein gay... Yeah aurora borealis ko dekhnay ka eek achhaa moqaa pesh karta hay, keunkah asmaan cum wo baish harr waqat tareek how gaa."" Yani, mausam-e-sarma mein tareeki ki wajah se sitaron aur aurora borealis ko dekhne ke imkanaat barh jaate hain.

Isliye, sahih jawab hai:

**C: Mosame sarmaa key mahino key doraan**
"
Kabb koyi satellite phone kisi cell phone kaa qabile amal badlah nahi hogaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Agar satellite ki taraf jaaney wali nazar ki line ruki ho sakti ho.**

The passage explicitly states that a satellite phone is *not* a good replacement for a cell phone because you need a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call. If that line of sight is blocked (e.g., by buildings, trees, mountains), the satellite phone won't work.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Agar mahalle waqoo bahut door ho (If the location is very far):** While satellite phones *are* often used in remote locations, remoteness alone doesn't prevent them from being a viable cell phone replacement *if* there's a clear line of sight.
*   **C: Agar iska baahar mein istemaal hota hogaa (If it is used outdoors):** While satellite phones are generally used outdoors, just being outdoors isn't the issue; it's the line of sight to the satellite that matters.
*   **D: Agar kisi muhim ko makhsus data ki zaruriyaat darkaar ho (If an expedition requires specific data needs):** This describes a situation *where* a satellite phone might be *useful*, not when it's *not* a suitable replacement for a cell phone."
Kabb kisi satellite phone ko cell phone parr tarjeeh di jaye gee?,"The correct answer is **B: Kisi kashti key safar key doraan**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that satellite phones are often used by ""shipping bashmol tafrihi kashti"" (including leisure boats) because they need remote data and voice communication. This directly supports option B.
*   Option A is incorrect because the passage implies satellite phones are used in remote, uncovered areas, not cities.
*   Option C is incorrect because the passage states satellite phones are useful when ""door kee malumat"" (remote data) is needed.
*   Option D is incorrect because the passage implies you'd only need a satellite phone where cell phone coverage is *not* available."
Darjah zail mein sey kiss parr tanazo Transnistria jamhuriyah key bananey ka baaes bana?,"Sawaal ka jawaab **C: Zubaan** hai.

Parraghraf mein wazeh toor parr zikr kiya gaya hai ke Moldwa eek kaseer nasli jamhuri milk hai jo nasli takrao ka shikaar raha hai. 1994 mein, yeh tanaza mashriqi Moldwa mein khud saakhta toor parr ailaan kardah jamhuria Transnistria kee tashkil kee jaanib ley gaya. Is sey pata chalta hai ke nasli takrao, jo aksar zubaan sey mutaliq hote hain, Transnistria jamhuria kee tashkil ka baaes bana.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon Transnistria jamhuriyah mein hay jo Moldova key baaqi sey mukhtalif hay?  ,"The correct answer is **C: UN ka tasleem karna (UN recognition)**.

The passage states that Transnistria has its own government and currency but ""is not recognized by any UN member state."" The other options are not specifically stated as being different between Moldova and Transnistria in the passage.
"
"Agar wohh hawadaar surate haal sey bachney ki ummid kar rahey hein to Ebarat key hisaab sey, eek mosaafir ko Montevideo ka kabb daurah karnaa chaiye?","The passage states that Montevideo's weather can get surprisingly cold in winter, with temperatures occasionally dropping below freezing and wind/humidity making it feel even colder. Therefore, to avoid the windy, cold conditions, a traveler should *not* visit during Montevideo's winter.

Montevideo experiences winter when the Northern Hemisphere experiences summer. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: Shumaali Hemisphere key mosame garmaa key mahino key doraan** (During the Northern Hemisphere's summer months)
"
"Agar wohh ziyadah thandey mosam key liye janibdaar hein to ebarat key hisaab sey, kisi mosaafir ko Montevideo ka daurah kabb karnaa chahiye?","The correct answer is **D: Jabb shumaali Hemisphere mein mosame sarmaa ho**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that Montevideo experiences winter when the Northern Hemisphere experiences summer and vice versa.
*   The question asks when a traveler who prefers colder weather should visit.
*   Therefore, the best time to visit for colder weather is when the Northern Hemisphere is in its winter season, meaning Montevideo is experiencing its summer.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon eek mustahkam graffiti fankaar sey wabastah is tor parr wabastah hogaa kehh wohh gunda gardi key khilaaf ho?","Sawal puchhta hai ke ek graffiti fankar jo vandalism ke khilaaf hai, woh ibarat ke hisaab se kya karega.

*   **A: Graffiti taqribaat** - Yeh possibility sab se behtar lagti hai. Ek graffiti fankar jo vandalism ke khilaaf hai, woh legally sanctioned events mein apni fun ka izhar karega.
*   **B: Likhawat** - Yeh bahut aam term hai aur graffiti fankar ke behaviour ko explicitly zahir nahi karta.
*   **C: Awami jayedaad par gair matlubah deewarein** - Yeh vandalism hai, aur is sawal ka maqsad ek aise fankar ko darshaana hai jo vandalism nahi karta.
*   **D: Najayez tagz** - Yeh bhi vandalism hai.

Is liye, sahih jawab **A: Graffiti taqribaat** hai."
Mosiqee tehwaron key konsey zawiyah ko kuchh shorakaa tajrabah ka aham hissah samajhtey hein?,"Correct Answer: B. Site parr camp karnaa

Explanation:
The passage states, ""Ziyadah ther hazireen nay asay tajarbay kaa eek badaa hissah girdana,"" which translates to ""A large number of attendees considered it a large part of the experience."" The ""it"" here refers to ""wahein padao daalnay kaa faislah kiya,"" which translates to ""decided to camp there."" Therefore, camping on the site is the aspect of music festivals that some attendees consider an important part of the experience.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, agar eek tehwaari shareek mosiqee sey qareeb camp karnaa chahey to ussey kiss cheez ko tarjeeh deni chahiye?","The passage states: ""Agar aap action co balkal qareeb say dekhna chahte hain to aap co mausiqi key qareeb camping key maqaam purr jagah paaney keliye jaldi jaana hoga.""

This directly translates to: ""If you want to see the action up close, you will have to go early to get a spot at the campsite near the music.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Jaldi sey aana (Arrive early)**.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Shumaali New Mexico mein raat ki zindagi haasil kartey waqt daurah karney walon ko kahaan sey bachna chahiye?","Sahi jawab hai **B: Chotey shahron key baar**

Di gai Ibarat mein wazeh taur par kaha gaya hai ke ""Chhoti bastion key baar yaa zarabgahein pardesiyon key liye aaney our bethnay key liye hamishah achhi jaghein nahein hotein"" aur ""madhush drivers kee kasafat chhote elaqon key baar key qareeb kaafi ziyadah hay.""  Is liye, shumaali New Mexico mein raat ki zindagi haasil kartey waqt chotey shahron key baar sey bachna chahiye."
Ebarat key hisaab sey shumaali New Mexico mein mashhoor tafreeh ko eek daurah karney keliye panaa kitnaa mumkin hay?,"Correct answer:

**C: Sante Fe key paas eek casino mein**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""...aap albikarki yaa santa fay kee taraf safar kiye baghair shabanah zindagi kaa khaatir khwah hasah malum nahein kirr saktay. Tahim, oper fehrist kardah taqriban tamaam casino mashrubaat farahim kartay hain...""
* This translates to: ""...you cannot experience a significant portion of nightlife without traveling towards Albuquerque or Santa Fe. However, virtually all of the casinos listed above provide drinks...""

This implies that casinos near Santa Fe (and Albuquerque) are good places to experience a lively nightlife.
"
Bajat sey bedaar mosaafiron ko kiss qism key mashroob sey bachney ki chahat ho sakti hay?,"The text mentions that fruit juice is expensive. Therefore, budget-conscious travelers might want to avoid it.

The correct answer is **D: Fal ka juice** (Fruit juice).
"
"Ebarat mein wazah elaqah ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail konsey mashroob key order ko eek server key zariyah mashkuk honey ka imkaan hay?","The passage describes the following about drinks:

*   ""Number one"" is a local beer that is light and refreshing.
*   ""Manta"" is another local beer.
*   French wines are available but wines from New Zealand and Australia travel better.
*   Tap water is safe, but bottled water is available.
*   Australians are unfamiliar with ""flat white"" coffee.
*   Short black is espresso.
*   Cappuccino has a lot of cream (no foam).
*   Tea is served without milk.
*   Hot chocolate is of Belgian quality.
*   Fruit juice is expensive but good.

The passage indicates that a ""flat white"" is unfamiliar to Australians. The area described in the passage appears to cater to Australians, hence a server might be confused by an order for ""flat white.""

So, the correct answer is D."
"Teeno mulkon key liye barqaraar rahtey huey, samraaji zamanah kiss jamaat ney shuru kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Spaniards**.

The passage states that the ""Spiniyon nay mustaariyat ahed kaa aaghaz kiya ju then sadee thak barqarar rehaa,"" which means ""The Spaniards started the colonial era that lasted three centuries.""
"
"Ebarart key hisaab sey, paris key kisi bashindey ko aap key liye warm up kareny kaa behtareen tariqah kiya hay?","The correct answer is **C: Mohazzab amal karnaa** (Act politely).

The passage explicitly states: ""peers mean jaaney kaa sub say behtareen tariqah achhaa royah pesh karnaa our aise shakhas kee tarah amal karnaa hay jis kee prorish achhi hoyee ho."" This translates to ""the best way to get along in Paris is to present a good attitude and act like a well-brought-up person,"" which is essentially acting politely.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kisko Paris key logon ki daqyanoosi sifat samjhaa jaata hay?","The correct answer is **A: Ghamand**.

The passage states that Parisians are known for being ""khud gharz, gher mahzab our maghrur,"" which translates to selfish, impolite, and arrogant/proud.  Therefore, ""ghamand"" (arrogance/pride) is the stereotypical trait mentioned.
"
Cape Town ki MetroRail parr pahley darjah ka fayedah kiya hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Bahut sey log nahein hein** (There are not many people).

The passage states: ""Metro pulse ziyadah aaram dah our cum bhed waala hota hay"" which translates to ""Metro pulse is more comfortable and has less crowding."" Therefore, less people is a benefit of the first class on Cape Town's MetroRail.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Cape Town ki harr mosaafir train mein kiya hotaa hay?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: Pahley aur teesrey dono darjey key coach**.

The passage states that ""Harr eek rail gaadi mean metro pulse our metro donon hee dabay hotay hain,"" which translates to ""Every train has both Metro Pulse and Metro coaches."" Metro Pulse is described as the ""first class"" and Metro is described as the ""third class,"" so both first and third class coaches are present.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko eek janwar ka keeda keliye karnaa mumkin nahein hay?,"Sawaal P ke mutabiq, keeday ghazaa ko kharab kar saktay hain, sozish (inflammation) ka sabab ban saktay hain, ya khatarnaak soorat mein allergic asraat ka sabab ban saktay hain, zahar phaila saktay hain ya infection pahuncha saktay hain. Lekin, sawaal P mein ye bhi wazeh kiya gaya hai ke logon ko apni taaqat ke zoor se zakhmi ya halaak karne wale khatarnaak janwar aam tor par waba ke tor par shumaar nahin hote.

Sawaal Q pooch raha hai ke darjah zail mein se kis ko ek janwar ka keeda karne ke liye mumkin nahi hai.

*   **A: Didora ki wajah banana** - Keeday didore (rashes) ka sabab ban saktay hain.
*   **B: Jalan wali allergy** - Keeday allergy ka sabab ban saktay hain.
*   **C: Infection failanaa** - Keeday infection phaila saktay hain.
*   **D: Taqatwar zakhamon ki wajah banana** - Sawaal P ke mutabiq, ye keedon ka kaam nahi hai, balkay taaqatwar janwaron ka kaam hai.

Isliye, sahih jawab hai:

**D: Taqatwar zakhamon ki wajah banana**
"
Pesh adaegi phone key card ko kahaan kharidaa ja saktaa hay?,"Correct Answer: C: Mod ki dukaano mein

Explanation:

The passage states that prepaid phone cards are available in ""harr chhoti dukaan mean"" which translates to ""every small store."" ""Mod ki dukaano mein"" (Mod stores) is the closest and most fitting option to ""every small store"" among the given choices."
Kuchh rasaayi yaaftah cardon ney behtar call ki qimaton ki peshkash kaisey ki hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Toll free number key zariyah**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Inn khidmaat thak rasayi aksar toll free telefon number key zariah hoti hay jis purr beshtar baghair balance charge key phone say call kee jasakti hay.""

This translates to: ""Access to these services is often through a toll-free telephone number on which calls can be made from most phones without a balance charge.""

This confirms that toll-free numbers are the means by which these cards are accessed. The passage doesn't say anything about only being accessed in specific countries (A), through Mod stores (C), or using pay phones plus extra charges (D).
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail konsa darakht Plitvice jheelon key qomi park mein kam aam hay?","The passage describes the trees in Plitvice Lakes National Park as ""basically consisting of beech, fir, and spruce trees"" and mentions that the park's special characteristic is the mixing of continental and sub-Mediterranean flora.  The passage doesn't specifically mention oak or coastline trees.

Therefore, the most likely answer is **A: Sahile samundar (coastline)** or **B: Baloot (Oak)** as they are not mentioned as being common, and the passage emphasizes the continental/sub-Mediterranean nature of the flora.  Given the other common tree types mentioned (fir and spruce), **B: Baloot (Oak)** is more likely to be the correct answer as coastline trees are generally rare in inland national parks.

Therefore the answer is **B**.
"
Darjah shaaz janwaron mein sey kon Plitvice jheelon key qomi park mein paya jaa sakta hay?,"The passage states: ""Nayaab haiwanat jaise kahh europi bhuray bhaalo, bhediye, baaz, aloo, lanks, jungli billy our **capreli** bahut say dosray aam aqsaam key saath dekhay jaa saktay hain.""

""Capreli"" is the phonetic spelling of ""Capercaillie"".

Therefore, the answer is **D: Capercaillie**.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Elaaqayi code asal mein kiskey saath taawun kartey hein?","Correct answer is **B: Bazaar ka control**

The passage clearly states: ""Waaqee maqsad inn companion co bazaar purr ziyadah control deena hay."" This translates to: ""The real purpose is to give these companies more control over the market.""

The passage argues that regional codes don't actually stop piracy (illegal copying), so options A, C, and D are incorrect. The true motive, according to the passage, is market control.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon Khittah key code key baarey mein eek jhoot hay, jo media companiyon ney barqaraar rakha hay?","The correct answer is **B: Wohh gair qanooni naqal sey bachney mein madad kartey hein**.

The passage explicitly states that media companies lie about region codes ""preventing piracy"" and that region codes have ""absolutely no effect"" on illegal copying. This means the statement that region codes help prevent illegal copying is a lie perpetuated by media companies.
"
"Apney watan mein pahunchney key waqt, konsa marhalah aam tor parr gair rasmi hota hay?","Correct answer is: **A: Muntaqilee padtaalein** (Immigration checks)

The passage says ""immigration chek aam tor purr nahein hota yaa mamuli hota hay,"" which translates to ""immigration check is usually not there or is minimal."" Therefore, immigration checks are the stage that is generally informal.
"
Darjah zail mein kisko apney watan mein pahunchney sey pahley aap ko janana chahiye?,"The correct answer is **B: Agar aap ko qanooni hodud parr ashyaa ka elaan karney ki zarurat ho.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes knowing what you can and cannot bring into the country and declaring items within legal limits.** This directly relates to needing to know if you need to declare goods within legal limits (option B).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Agar wahan muntaqili checkpoint hoga** (If there will be a transfer checkpoint): While a transfer checkpoint might exist, the passage focuses on *customs* and declaring goods, not general transfers.
* **C: Agar custom control hogaa** (If there will be custom control):  Customs control will always happen when you return to your country. But the passage wants you to know if you have to declare any goods, irrespective of customs control.
* **D: Agar kisi ashyaa ko aap laa rahey hon to uski ejaazat na ho** (If you are bringing something that is not allowed): The passage advises you to know what is allowed so that you will not bring an unpermitted item.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss cheez ki kasrat chadhney waley ko mustaqil tor parr Cochamó waadi key andar naye raaston ko daryaaft karney ki ijaazat deti hay?","The correct answer is **D: Deewarein**.

The passage states that climbers are constantly trying to create new routes ""between its endless series of walls."" This indicates that the abundance of walls is what allows climbers to discover new routes within the Cochamó Valley."
"Ebarat mein dee gayi malumaat ki buniyaad parr, Jonubi Hemisphere mein ziyaadah tarr crossing kaa kon ehaatah karta hay?","Sawaal mein di gayi ma'lumat ke mutabiq, Star Alliance tamam elaqon ko ehaatah karta hai, siwae Santiago, Chile se Tahiti tak mashriqi janubi behr al-kahil ke, jise LATAM Oneworld flight cover karti hai. Lekin sawaal mein yeh bhi kaha gaya hai ke koi bhi airline alliance teeno samandari crossings ko ehaatah nahin karta. Iska matlab hai ke Star Alliance sab se ziyada elaqon ko ehaatah karta hai, lekin mukammal tor par nahi.

Is lihaaz se, sahih jawab hai:

**B: Star Alliance**
"
Konsey airline ka ettehaad Jonubi Hemisphere mein samundar crossing ki kam az kam miqdaar ka ehaatah karta hay?,"Sahi jawab hai **A: Star Alliance**

PaaTh ke mutabik, Star Alliance janubi nisf korah ke tamaam elaqon ko cover karta hai, siwae Santiago, Chile se Tahiti tak mashriqi janubi Bahar-ul-Kahir ke, jise LATAM Oneworld ki flight cover karti hai. Paara graph meen yeh bhee kaha gaya hai ke koi bhee airline ittihad inn tinon samandar crossings ko cover nahein karta, is se yeh pata chalta hai ke Star Alliance sab se zyada samandar crossings ko cover karta hai."
Konsi daurah ki tanzeem alami dauraey karaney wali ki janasheeni ki?,"The correct answer is **B: Daurah karatey rahnaa (Go Running Tours)**

The passage states: ""Global running tours kaa jansheen, go running tours key paas chaar baraazmon mean darjanon saait running providers kaa neat work hay.""

This translates to: ""Go Running Tours is the successor to Global Running Tours, and has a network of dozens of site running providers in four branches.""

Therefore, Go Running Tours is the organization that succeeded Global Running Tours.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, daurah karatey rahnaa kitni mukhtalif nazarah waali tanzeemon sey rabetah karney mein madad karti hay?","The correct answer is **C: Darjano (Dozens)**.

The passage states that ""Go Running Tours"" has a network of ""darjanon saait running providers"" (dozens of site running providers) across four branches. This implies that ""Go Running Tours"" helps connect with dozens of different organizations.
"
Sabsey ziyadah saaf shaffaaf mumkanah cheetah key nazarah ki agar koyi sayyah ummid kar raha hay to usey kiya karnaa chahiye?,"The correct answer is **C: Doorbeen istemaal karein**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that animals like lions, cheetahs, and leopards are usually shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
*   Other options:
    *   A: The passage doesn't explicitly say cheetahs are easier to spot on a walking safari.
    *   B: It is just a another name for the first option
    *   D: While a car and good equipment are good for viewing some animals, the passage says cheetahs are shy and better viewed with binoculars."
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, kis qism key janwar ka mumkanah tor parr eek daurah karney waley ko kisi gaadi mein safari ki muhim key doraan samnaa karna padey gaa?","The correct answer is **B: Jiraaf**.

The passage states: ""Kachh janwar, jaise haathi our jiraaf, kaaron key qareeb aajate hain our mayari saamaan key zariah achhi tarah say dekhay jayein gay."" (Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, come close to cars and can be seen well through standard equipment.)

The passage also says that lions, leopards and cheetahs are generally shy."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kisi safar ki kam tar qimat kiya hogee?","The passage says that group travel is cheaper for big groups. It suggests forming a group of four to six people for a more affordable per-person rate. It also implies that solo or two-person travel is more expensive and might be exploited by tour operators to charge more. Therefore, the lowest possible price would be achieved by finding a group of four people.

So the answer is **B: Chaar logon ki eek jamaat ko talaash karna**.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Mumkanah tor parr behtareen safar key daurah ko kaun mahfooz karegaa?","The passage states that group travel is cost-effective for larger groups (4-6 people). Therefore, the best option for a cost-effective trip, according to the passage, would be:

*   **D: Paanch logon ki eek jamaat (A group of five people)**

The passage suggests this size group maximizes cost-effectiveness. The other options are either too small (not taking advantage of group rates) or focused on a scam."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, San Francisco ki aalami shanakht mein kiss cheez ney taawun kiya thaa?","Sawaal P mein bilkul wazeh taur par zikr kiya gaya hai ke: ""Iss ki mausiqi, film, adab our awami culture mean matwatar tasveer kashee say yeah shehar our iss key mualim saree duniya mean maruf how gaye.""

Is liye, sahih jawab **A: Fan aur media ki mukhtalif shaklon mein aksar mojudgi** hai."
Ebarat key hisaab sey San Francisco key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sahee nahein hay?,"Correct answer: **D: Eqtesaad ka puri tarah seyahat parr bharosa bharosa hay**

**Reason:**

*   The passage states that San Francisco's economy, while linked to tourism, is ""diversified."" It also mentions that the largest employment sectors are professional services, government, finance, business, and tourism. This indicates that the economy is not entirely reliant on tourism.
*   The other options (A, B, and C) are all directly supported by information in the passage."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kis qism key mosaafir ko safar key agent ki khidmaat ka istemaal karney sey fayedah honaa mumkin nahein hay?","Sahi jawab hai **B: Besaakhtagi ka shikaar eek mosaafir**.

Wajah:

*   Paishgegi booking ki ahmiyat, travel agents ki deals aur pekach aafars ka zikar hai. Isse pata chalta hai ke travel agents un logon ke liye zyada mufeed hain jo pehle se mansuba bandi karte hain.
*   Besaakhtagi ka shikaar musafir, jo achanak se safar karne ka faisla karta hai, usse travel agent ki paishgi booking se zyada faida nahi hoga. Unko hotels ki deals ya visa ka intezam karne mein time lag sakta hai, jisse reservation mein dikkat aa sakti hai.

Baaki options:

*   **A: Eek gair faisalah kun mosaafir:** Ese musafir ko travel agent madad kar sakta hai options dene aur faisla karwane mein.
*   **C: Eek mosaafir jisney abhi apna visa mahfooz nahein kiya hay:** Ese musafir ko travel agent visa requirements ke bare mein guide kar sakta hai aur booking hold kar sakta hai.
*   **D: Eek mosaafir jo booking safah key saudon ko tarjeeh detaa hay:** Ese musafir ko travel agent ke sath booking karne se fayda hoga, kyunki wo aam tor par makhsus deals dete hain."
Darjah zail mein sey kisko ebarat mein safari agent key zariyah booking key fayedah key tor par zikr naein kiya gaya hay?,"Let's analyze the passage and the options:

*   **P: Paishgi booking musafir co zahni sokoon ataa karti hay kahh apni manzal purr pahunchnay key baad sonay kaa intezam hojaye gaa.** (Advance booking gives mental peace to the traveler that after reaching their destination, accommodation will be arranged.) This relates to having a reservation (Option D).
*   **Travel agents key paas aksar makhsus hotels kee deals yaa paishkashen hoti hain...** (Travel agents often have special hotel deals or offers...) This directly mentions Hotel deals (Option B).
*   **Travel agent aam tor say aise pekach aafar kartay hain ju nashta, air port say jaaney aaney key liye naql wo hamal key intezamat yaa mushtarkah tor purr hotel our jehaaz key bhee pekaj hotay hain.** (Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or combined hotel and airfare packages.) This refers to all-inclusive packages (Option C).
*   The passage **does not** specifically mention fast travel documents (Option A) as a benefit provided by booking through a travel agent. Visa information is mentioned, but not the speed of obtaining travel documents.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Tezz safar key dastavezaat**."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Haqiqi waqt key matan key motarjim ki darkhawastein kiss cheez key qaabil nahein hein?","The correct answer is **D: Waqt ka 100% durust tor parr tarjumaa karnaa**.

The passage states ""...lekin phir bhee ehtiyaat laazim hay kiyon kahh wah abb bhee saare kaa saara ghalat kirr saktay hain."" This translates to ""but caution is still necessary because they can still be completely wrong."" This indicates that real-time translation apps are *not* capable of translating with 100% accuracy. The other options (A, B, and C) are abilities mentioned in the passage as things the apps *can* do.
"
Offline tarjumey karney ki kiss cheez sey ijazat milti hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Zubaan key data ko download karnaa (Downloading language data)**.

Darjah zail mein sey kon barfaani todey kaa moharrik nahi hay?,"Sawaal P mein wazahat sey kaha gaya hay keh ""baaz auqaat asl moharrik waaqiah barf co garma denay waala sooraj hota hay, kabhi kabhi kachh ziyadah barf baari hoti hay, kabhi dosray qudarati mazahir, to aksar koyee insaan."" Iss sey yeah wazeh hota hay keh insaan, sooraj (dhoop), our ezaafi barf baari barfani today ke moharrik bunn saktey hain.

Sawaal mein 'chaspaan baraf' kee hasiyat ko ek shart ke tour per bataya gaya hay, nah keh asl moharrik ke tour per. P se pata chalta hay keh barf chapki hoyee hay iss liye iss co neechey giranay key liye kachh jhatka laganay kee zaroorat hay, our kuchh barf kaa neechey girna baaqi barf key girnay kaa sabab bunn sakta hay. Yeah shart barfani today ke liye zaroori hai, lekin khud woh shaks nahi hay jo isey shuru karay.

Iss liye, darja bala mein sey, barfani today kaa moharrik *nahi* hay:

**A: Chaspaan baraf**
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon barfaani todey ki tarah neechey aata hay?","Sahi jawaab hai: **C: Khadi dhalwaano parr ziyadah baraf ka hajam**

**Tashreeh:**

Passage mein wazeh taur parr zikr kiya gaya hai ke ""ziyadah miqdaar barfani today kee manind girti hay"" yaani ziyada miqdaar mein jama hui baraf ek barfani tode ki tarah giregi. Is ke bar-aks, digar options sahih nahi hain:

*   **A:** Chaspaan baraf jo tahrik shudah nahein hay (Chaspaan baraf jo tab tak nahin hilti jab tak usay cheda nahin jaata)
*   **B:** Begair baraf key khadi dhalwaanein (Baraf ke baghair khari dhalwaan, koi barfani tode ki tarah nahin girti)
*   **D:** Insaano ney baraf ko achoot chod diya (Agar insan baraf ko achhoot chhod dete hain, to woh barfani tode ki tarah nahi girti.)"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, saalan kon sey ajzaa key ird gird mabni hay?","The correct answer is **B: jadee booti aur masalah**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that curry masala (masalah) and nabatat (which translates to herbs or vegetation) are used with meat or vegetables to create the dish. Therefore, the dish is mainly based on herbs and spices.
* The other options aren't the main components described in the passage.
"
"Makhsus khitton mein, nariyal ka doodh baaz auqaat eek mulk mein kiss juzw ki jagah istemaal hotaa hay?","The correct answer is **C: Dahee (Dahi)**.

The passage states: ""jonubi hind our barsaghir key deegar saheli elaqon mean omuman narial kaa doodh istemaal kiya jaataa hay"", meaning ""in South India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is generally used."" Then it mentions that in North India and Pakistan, dahi (yogurt) is commonly used in Kadhi. This implies coconut milk is used in place of yogurt in certain regions.
"
Transantarctic pahaadon key gardo nawah mein eek ghumao kiya hota hay jisey plateau key andar janey ki dar kaar hoti hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Makhsus tractor furteeley hotey hein.**

Here's why:

* **The passage says:** ""Yeah sub bahut phurtele nahein hain, chunancha trial co plato purr aaney key liye trans interact mountain key ird gird taweel chakkar lagana padta hay."" This directly states that the tractors (or everything involved in the trail) are *not* agile/fast, forcing a long detour.
* **Option C:** directly contradicts this statement.
Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: McMurdo Station aksar band rahta hay:** The passage doesn't mention whether McMurdo Station is frequently closed.
* **B: compact baraf khatarnaak hota hay:** The passage doesn't explicitly state that the compact ice is dangerous.
* **D: Ross Sea key zariyah safar karney sey yehh ziyaadah aasan hay:** The passage does not provide information on whether travelling via Ross Sea is easier.

Therefore, the only answer choice that can be derived from the given passage is option C.
"
"Jonubi Pole Traverse key kinaarey, kiss cheez ko jhandon sey nishaan zadd kiya jataa hay?","The correct answer is **A: McMurdo Station ki pagdandi (McMurdo Station Trail)**

The passage states: ""iss key those barf mean gadhay karkay nishan key tor purr jhanday lagaa diay jaatay hain."" This translates to ""In its frozen snow, flags are placed to mark the trail."" The passage then goes on to describe this trail as the one leading from McMurdo Station to the South Pole. Therefore, the trail from McMurdo Station is the feature marked with flags.
"
Ebarat mein kiya iss tor parr mazkoor nahein hay kehh kiss cheez sey Jonubi Africa ki daryaaft kartey waqt sayyahon ko aagah rahnaa chahiye?,"The correct answer is **C: Jonubi Africa key pados key taqriban tamaam mamalik mustahkam hein**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that ""bhalay hee janubi afriqah mean istehkaam ho leakin tamaam padosi mamalik mean istehkaam kaa maahul nahein hay"" (although South Africa is stable, not all neighboring countries have a stable environment). Therefore, option C is incorrect according to the passage.
*   Option A is correct as stated in the passage ""Veza key taqazay our ikhrajat qaum darr qaum mukhtalif hain ""
*   Option B is correct as stated in the passage ""kaar say daakhil honaa uss khitah kee zeebai kaa dedaar karnay key liye neez inn maqamat thak pahunchnay mean hairatnaak hay ju tourist root say pray hain""
*   Option D is correct as stated in the passage ""tahim eek 4x4 kee shaded salah dye jaati hay our bhat say maqamat 4x4 key bees waale pahiyon key saath hee qaabil rasayi how saktay hain"""
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, car sey jonubi Africa ko daryaaft karney ko dekh rahey sayyahon key liye kisko bura mashwarah samjha jaata hay?","The correct answer is **B: Agarcheh 4x4 ki sifarish ki jaati ho, ziyadah tar mahallaate waqoo eek aam gaadi key saath qaabile rasaayi hay.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:**  That while a regular car *can* work with careful planning, a 4x4 is ""strongly recommended,"" and many places are *only* accessible with 4x4 vehicles.  Therefore, the passage is implying that most places can **not** be accessibly by a car.  Therefore, the statement ""Agarcheh 4x4 ki sifarish ki jaati ho, ziyadah tar mahallaate waqoo eek aam gaadi key saath qaabile rasaayi hay"" is the most opposite thing from the actual passage, and is therefore the worst possible advice.

Here's why the other options are *not* the best answers:

* **A: Drune car makhsus fauri ashyaa ho sakta hay qanoon ko matlub ho:**  The passage mentions ""certain emergency items"" might be required.  This isn't necessarily *bad* advice, as it's important to be aware of local laws.
* **C: Aam raston sey inheraaf karney ko dekh rahey logo key liye car sey safar karnaa badi baat hay:** The passage actually encourages going off the tourist routes, but it emphasizes the need for careful planning or a 4x4. The advice isn't necessarily bad, it's context-dependent.
* **D: Jonubi Africa key pados waley tamaam mamalik daurah karney key liye namoonah nahein hein:** The passage says that not all neighboring countries are stable, which is a *warning*, not necessarily bad advice, but a necessary consideration."
Darjah zail mein sey kon ebarat mein iss tor parr mazkoor nahein hay kehh aapkey bagon ko chodney ka mumkanah khatrah ko nazar andaaz kar diya gaya hay?,"The passage mentions the following potential dangers of leaving your bags unattended:

*   **A: Ho sakta hay unki chori ho gayi ho** (They might be stolen) - Mentioned as ""Lawaris bags choron key nishanay purr hotay hain"".
*   **B: Aap anjaaney mein manshiyaat ley jaaney waley ban saktey hein** (You might unknowingly become a drug carrier) - Mentioned as ""Tum paao gay kahh tumhare ilm key baghair tum co drigg career qaraar day diyaa gayaa hay"".
*   **D: Ho sakta hay kehh zimmah daar unhein eek mumkanah bam key khartah key tor parr dekhtey hon** (Authorities might view them as a potential bomb threat) - Mentioned as ""bom key khatraat say choknehkam kee uss taraf nigaah padsakti hay"".

The passage does **not** directly mention that leaving your bags unattended could lead to *someone else* falling under suspicion. It focuses on the consequences for the *owner* of the unattended bag.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: Wohh kisi aur sey shak mein padd saktey hein** (Someone else might fall under suspicion)."
Manshiyaat ley jaaney key talluq sey ebarat mein kiyaa mazkoor nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Zimmah daar aapkey bagon ko zabt kar saktey hein agarcheh aap manshiyaat na ley jaa rahey hon**.

Here's why:

*   **A:** The passage states ""Kuchh mamalik mean pehli baar jurm sarzad karnay waalon keliye bhee nehayat zalimana saza mojud hay; inn mean 10 salon thak jail yaa maut kee saza shaamil hay"". So this IS mentioned.

*   **B:** The passage starts with ""Jab dosray tumhara saamaan lay jaa rahay hone to apnay bags purr nazar rakho khosusan bain alaqwami sarhadon co obur kartay waqat."" This clearly advises extra caution during international travel, so this IS mentioned.

*   **C:** The passage says ""iss mean waiting line bhee hoti hay, iss liye kahh baghair kisee ettelaa key soonghne waale kutton kaa kisee bhee waqat istemaal kiya jasakta hay."" This explicitly mentions the use of drug-sniffing dogs without notice, so this IS mentioned.

*   **D:** The passage does not mention authorities confiscating bags *even if you are not carrying drugs*. It focuses on the risk of being framed as a drug carrier unknowingly. It talks about *others* planting drugs and you being held responsible. It also talks about dangers of leaving luggage unattended. But not authorities confiscating bags even if you have done nothing wrong.

Therefore, D is the only option not explicitly mentioned in the passage."
Kiss qism key mashroob ko iss tor parr zikr nahein kiya gaya hay kehh qiyaam key doraan ghar parr koyi cheez bananey ki koshish karna hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Beer**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions making coffee, tea, juice, and smoothies at home during a staycation.
*   Beer is mentioned as something you might drink at a bar or pub in a different neighborhood.
"
Aap qeyaam key doraan darjah zail mein sey kiska daurah karnaa chahtey hein agar aapka shahar piney ki saqafat keliye mashhoor ho?,"The correct answer is **C: Sharaab khaaney jahaan aap aam tor parr ziyadha nahein jatey hein**.

The passage specifically suggests visiting ""baarz yaa pubs mean jayein jahaan aap matwatir nahein jaatay"" if you live in a city with a different drinking culture.
"
Faakhtah key mojassamey kahaan waqea hein?,"The correct answer is **B: Church key sahan mein**.

The passage clearly states: ""Cleasa key sahan mean kachh maqbaron purr sing marmar say banay fakhtaon dilchasp mujasme hain.""  This translates to ""In the churchyard are some tombs with interesting sculptures of marble doves.""
"
Kis qism key visa ko kaafi maliyaati taawun ka soboot faraham karney key liye kisi shakhs ki darkaar hoti hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Talabah ka visa**.

The passage explicitly states that students need to provide proof of funds for at least the first year of study in order to obtain a student visa.
"
Bahut ziyadah mumkanah tor parr tausee shudah visa ki kisko darkaar hay?,"Sahi jawab hai:

**C: Eek aalami talabah (Ek bain-ul-aqwami talib-e-ilm)**

Peechle paragraf mein aalami talib-e-ilm ko visa lena hota hai kyun ki usey talimi maqasid ke liye kisi desh mein lambi muddat tak rahna hota hai, jo ki aam tur par tourist ya karobari logun ke mukable mein ziyada waqt hota hai.
"
Machcharon ki aapko khaas tor parr kabb yaad aani chahiye?,"The passage implies that you should be particularly aware of mosquitoes during all of the listed options, but let's analyze which is the *most* directly emphasized:

*   **A: Mosame garma key mahino key doraan (During the summer months):** The passage *starts* by mentioning summer (Moasim garma), suggesting it's a key period.

*   **B: Paidal safar parr (On foot):** The passage mentions hiking through dense forests.

*   **C: Barish key jangalaat mein (In rainforests):** The passage discusses subtropical rainforests.

*   **D: Chalatey waqt (While walking):** While walking is implied by hiking, it's not the primary focus.

Considering the passage's emphasis, the most directly emphasized and overarching answer is **A: Mosame garma key mahino key doraan (During the summer months).** The other factors (hiking, rainforests) are conditions that worsen the mosquito problem *during* the summer.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, barish key jangal mein drve kartey waqt machcharon sey bachney key liye kiya karney sey aapko ruknaa chahiye?","The correct answer is **A: Bahut der tak gaadi key darwazon ko khula chodna** (Leaving the car doors open for too long).

The passage specifically states that in subtropical rainforests, opening the car door for even a few seconds is enough time for mosquitoes to enter. Therefore, to avoid mosquitoes while driving in a rainforest, you should avoid leaving the car doors open for too long.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Sundarbans key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sahee nahein hay?","The correct answer is **B: Iskey kul elaqah mein sey aadha daldal mein fansa hua hay**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""one-third of the area is water/swamp."" So, it is false to state half of the total area is swampy.

The other options are all correct based on the passage:

*   A: Yehh bahut kam bach jaaney waley taqatwar janglon mein sey kuchh ko nomayan karta hay (The passage says that ""the forests contain some of the last remaining patches of great forests which once covered the Gangetic Plain."")
*   C: Yehh duniya ka sabsey bada mangrove belt hay (The passage states that ""Sundarban is the world's largest littoral mangrove belt."")
*   D: Yehh bengal key tigaron sey ziyadah chitkabrey hirano ka ghar hay (The passage states that there are approximately 400 Bengal tigers and nearly 30,000 spotted deer.)"
Jangal ka konsa hissah Hindusani elaqah mein padta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Sundarbans ka qomi Park** (Sundarban National Park).

The passage states: ""bhaarti elaqay mean mojud jungle kaa hissah sundarban national park kahalata hay."" (The portion of the forest in the Indian territory is called Sundarban National Park.)
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiskey paas bahut mumkanah tor parr angrezi zubaan ki kam az kam mahdud samajh hay?","Sahi jawab **B: Kam umar key log** hai.

Ibarat mein wazeh tor parr bayan kiya gaya hai ke ""bahut se mokammal aqwam english mokammal rawani se boltay hain our aap toqaa kirr saktay hain kahh hattayi kahh iss say ziyadah key paas mahdud ilm hota hay, khaas tor purr chhoti umar key log."" Iss ka matlab hai ke chhoti umar ke logon ke angrezi zuban ki kam az kam samajh hone ka zyada imkan hai.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiska talaffuz karnaa mushkil ho sakta hay?","The correct answer is **A: Mumtaaz lahjon waley alfaaz (Distinctly accented words)**.

The passage states that correct pronunciation is often difficult, especially in speeches (khatabat). Then it describes people from different places (London, Boston, Jamaica, Sydney) sharing stories in their native accents and dialects.  This implies that the variety of accents makes understanding each other, and therefore pronouncing words in those distinct accents, challenging.

Therefore, the passage suggests that words with distinct accents are the most difficult to pronounce, especially when people from different regions are speaking.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, andrune zilaa station sey bus leney ka mansubah bananey waley kisi mosaafir key liey konsa manzar naamah nomunah ban sakta hay?","The correct answer is **A: Mosaafir Jakar ki taraf aagey badh raha hey aur usney pahley sey eek sabiqah ticket kharid rakha hay**

Here's why:

*   **Jakar/Bumthang Direction and Advance Booking:** The text mentions that buses going towards the east (specifically Jakar/Bumthang) leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM. It also advises buying tickets in advance because the inter-district buses are often full.
*   **Option A aligns perfectly:** A traveler heading to Jakar and having already purchased a ticket exemplifies the advice given in the text.

Let's examine why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Mosaafir Bumthang ki taraf aagey badh raha hey aur 7 tak usey chod kar jaaney ki zarurat hay** It's possible, but doesn't highlight the advance booking suggestion. The time constraint makes it less ideal (potentially adding stress if the bus is full).
*   **C: Mosaafir Paro ki taraf aagey badh raha hey aur 11 tak usey chod kar jaaney ki zarurat hay** Paro is a nearby location, and the text suggests shared taxis are a better and faster option for nearby destinations. Also, advance booking isn't as crucial for these short taxi trips.
*   **D: Mosaafir purab ki taraf aagey badh raha hey aur 6:20 sey pahley station parr pahunchey gaa** While heading east is relevant, arriving before 6:20 doesn't guarantee a seat, especially if the buses are full. Advance booking remains the best approach as recommended in the text."
Andarune zilaa bus station sey mashriq ki taraf safar karney ko dekhney waley kisi sayyah key liye kiya cheez eek achcha noktah ho sakta hay?,"The best advice for a tourist looking to travel east from the inter-district bus station, based on the provided text, is **B: Peshgi ticket kharidein (Buy a ticket in advance)**.

Here's why:

*   The text specifically states that buses going east towards Jakar/Bumthang depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.

*   It then advises purchasing tickets in advance because inter-district buses are often full.

Therefore, buying a ticket in advance is the most relevant and helpful piece of advice given the specific travel scenario.

**Why the other options are less suitable:**

*   **A: 8:30 key baad sirf basein rawanah hoti hein (Only buses depart after 8:30):** Incorrect, as the text mentions eastern-bound buses leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
*   **C: Bahut see basein dinn bhar rawanah hoti hein (Many buses depart throughout the day):** While true generally for inter-district travel, it doesn't address the specific eastern-bound travel concern.
*   **D: Eek mushtarekah taxi mein safar key sabsey ziyadah smart wasayel ho saktey hein (Traveling in a shared taxi may be the smartest means):** While shared taxis are mentioned, the text does not imply they are necessarily the ""smartest"" way to travel, particularly for longer inter-district journeys. Also, the cost of shared taxis is specified only for Paaro and Panakha."
Darjah zail mein sey kon Timbuktu ki durust wazahat nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Yehh sayyarah sey na qaabile rasaayi hay (It is inaccessible from the planet).**

Here's why:

*   **P states**: ""Iss key banisbat naqabil rasayi purr mushtamil """"tumbto"""" kaa naam gher mulki, door daraaz elaqay key istearay key toor purr istemaal hota thaa."" (Timbuktu, once considered inaccessible, was used as a metaphor for foreign, far-off places.)
*   **P also states**: ""our iss kaa eek hawai addah hay"" (and it has an airport.)
The passage never mentioned it is not accessible from the planet.
The other options are supported by the text:

*   **A**: ""iss mean afriqi key bajaye ziyadah ther arabi mezaaj zoq paya jaataa hay"" (it has more of an Arab flavor than African).
*   **B**: ""Aaj tumbucto eek nadaar elaqah hay"" (Today Timbuktu is a poor area).
*   **D**: ""iss kee sakha asay eek seyahati dilkashi say bharpur elaqah banaati hay"" (its richness makes it a tourist attraction)."
Timbuktu key baarey mein konsi darjah zail haqeeqt sahee hay?,"Let's analyze the provided text (P) and the answer options (A, B, C, D):

*   **Text (P) says:**
    *   Timbuktu was once a name for a remote place.
    *   Timbuktu is now a poor region.
    *   It has tourist potential.
    *   It has an airport (implying accessibility).
    *   It's listed as a World Heritage Site in danger due to desert sands.
    *   It has a more Arabic feel than African.

*   **Option A: Shahar sayyarah sey qaabile rasaayi hay (The city is accessible by planet):** This is too broad. The text refers to an airport, not access from other planets. Not a good fit.

*   **Option B: Yehh gareeb sey ziyadah gair mulkee hay (It is more foreign than poor):** The text says ""Aaj tumbucto eek nadaar elaqah hay"" (Today Timbuktu is a poor region). This option is incorrect.

*   **Option C: Ismein gardo nawah key shaharon ki banisbat kam tar Afriki zayeqah hay (It has less African flavor than the surrounding cities):** The text states ""Yeah shehar milk key baqiyah tamaam shehron say makmal tor purr mukhtalif hay, iss liye kahh iss mean afriqi key bajaye ziyadah ther arabi mezaaj zoq paya jaataa hay."" (This city is completely different from all the other cities in the country, because it has more of an Arabic taste than African). This option aligns perfectly with this statement.

*   **Option D: Yehh shahar sayyahon key liye mazeed pur kashish nahein hay (This city is no longer attractive to tourists):** The text says ""halankah iss kee sakha asay eek seyahati dilkashi say bharpur elaqah banaati hay"" (Although its wealth makes it a tourist attraction). This directly contradicts the option.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C**."
Mosame garma key Olympics ki asal mein kabb miqaat bandi ki gayee thee? ,"The correct answer is **D: Julayi 2020**.

The passage states: ""...leakin march key aakhir say ziyadah ther corona wires purr mubni policy july 2020 thak tausia nahein hoti hay, jib olympic co mansukh karnay kaa faislah kiya gayaa thaa."" This indicates that the decision to cancel the Olympics was made in July 2020 due to the coronavirus.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss noqtah chimney toofan ban jaati hay?","The correct answer is **D: Zameen ko chooney key baad**.

The passage states, ""Inn kee sharoaat toofani baadlon say nikalnay waale gaalon jaisi hoti hay leakin zameen co chhoote hee wah """"aandhi"""" bunn jaatay hain."" This directly translates to ""Their beginnings are like cheeks coming out of stormy clouds, but as soon as they touch the ground, they become a """"storm"""".""
"
Inmein sey kon toofan ki durust khosusiyat nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Wohh baahar hawa ko dhakelney waley kalmon ki katayi kar rahey hein**.

Here's why:

*   **P** states that a tornado *draws* air inward and upward. Option D describes the opposite: pushing air outward. Therefore, this is not a characteristic of tornadoes according to the passage.

The other options are supported by the passage:

*   **A:** Passage mentions speeds of 100-200 miles per hour.
*   **B:** Passage states that it carries heavy objects.
*   **C:** Passage states they start as spouts from storm clouds but become ""tornadoes"" upon touching ground. While ""chimneys"" isn't the exact wording, it's a reasonable (although simplified) interpretation of the transformation upon ground contact."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, eek mosaafir ko apney manzil shahar mein kahaan sey seyaasi halat key baarey mein mashwarah haasil karnaa chahiye?","The correct answer is **D: Khud apni hukumat sey**.

The passage states:

*  ""Aap apni hukumat key elawah doosri hukumaton kaa mashurah bhee leena chaah saktay hain, leakin unn kaa mashurah inn key apnay shahriyon key liye hota hay.""  This implies your own government's advice is most relevant to *you*.

The other options are flawed because:

* **A: Uss mulk ki hukumat sey jiska wohh dorah kar rahey hein:** The passage never suggests you seek advice from the government of the country you're visiting.
* **B: Safar ki advisory mein pesh kardah nazaron sey:** The passage warns that government advisories are simplified and potentially superficial.
* **C: Jis mulk ka wohh daurah kar rahey hein uskey shahriyon sey:** While you could gather information from local citizens, the passage emphasizes consulting your own government's advice first.
"
"Safar ki advisory key pasey manzar mein, khaarji shahriyon ko kiss cheez ka samnaa karna namumkin hay?","Sawal Q pooch raha hai ke safar ki advisory (safri tajaweez) ke baes khaarji shahriyon ko kya cheez mumkin nahi hai.

*   **A:** Motassirah ki mansukhi ka insurance (Affected cancellation insurance) - Paragraph mein zikar hai ke safri tajaweez se safri sehat ka bemah ya mansookhi ka bemah mutassir ho sakta hai.
*   **B:** Mulk ki seyasi surate haal key baarey mein hadd sey ziyaadah aasan khulasey (Overly simplified summaries of the political situation of the country) - Paragraph mein wazeh tor par likha hai ke hukumati salah kisi mulk ki siyasi halat ka mahaz mukhtasir bayanaiyya hai aur pesh kiye gaye khayalat aksar sarsari, umumi aur bahut ziyaada sada hain.

*   **C:** Motassirah ki sehat ka insurance (Affected health insurance) - Paragraph mein zikar hai ke safri tajaweez se safri sehat ka bemah mutassir ho sakta hai.
*   **D:** Mulk ki seyaasi surate haal key baarey mein tafseeli malumaat (Detailed information about the political situation of the country) - Paragraph mein wazeh tor par likha hai ki hukoomati salah tafseeli malumaat se kam hoti hai, jo dosri jaghon per milti hain. Isi liye ye mumkina nahi hai ke khaarji shahriyon ko safar ki advisory mein tafseeli malumat mil sakti hain.

Isliye, sahih jawab hai:
**D: Mulk ki seyaasi surate haal key baarey mein tafseeli malumaat**"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kis qism key safar ko kisi safar key agent sey booking ka taawun haasil karna kam az kam mumkin hay?","Sawaal ke mutabiq, paragraph mein safar agent ke faide bataye gaye hain. Unn faidoon ke lehaaz se, darj zeel safar mein safar agent se madad lene ki kam zaroorat hogi:

*   **A: Eek shahar mein kaam ki conference ka safar jiska mosaafir ney iss sey pahley daurah kiya ho** - Kyunki musafir pahle se hi us shahar se waqif hai, aur conference ka safar aam taur par seedha hota hai.

Is liye sahih jawab **A** hai."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss manzar naamah mein safari agent ki madad sey eek mosaafir ko sabsey ziyaadah faaedah haasil hota hay?","The passage states that a travel agent is a good alternative for travel that goes beyond a traveler's previous experience with natural landscapes, culture, language, or low-income countries. It also mentions agents having expertise in specific types of travel.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A:** Booking round trip flights to one's home country doesn't usually require specialized knowledge beyond what a traveler already knows.

*   **B:** The passage suggests travel agents have expertise in specific types of travel. If a traveler is interested in booking a specialized trip for the first time, an agent's knowledge is very useful.

*   **C:** If the traveler is fluent in the local language, they may be comfortable doing travel planning on their own.

*   **D:** Travel agents can help with culture shock.

Therefore, the best answer is **B** because the passage states travel agents have expertise in specialized trips.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, naye maqamaat ka daurah kartey waqt eek mosaafir ko mayoosi sey bachney mein kiya cheez madad kar sakti hay?","The correct answer is **B: Eek gair maanus khaano ko aazmaaney ki chaahat** (A willingness to try unfamiliar food).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes adapting to differences:** The passage states that when traveling, you shouldn't expect things to be the same as ""at home."" It lists differences like customs, laws, food, transportation, accommodation, standards, and language.  The main point is to be aware of these differences *before* they occur.
* **Avoiding disappointment:** The passage concludes by saying that keeping these differences in mind helps avoid disappointment and disapproval of local customs.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wohh log jahaan sey hein usee tarah key meyaar ki tawaqqo karnaa:** (Expecting the same standards as where they are from) The passage suggests the opposite -- you shouldn't expect things to be the same.
*   **C: Jahaan key hein ussi tarah key qanoon ko manana:** (Following the same laws as where they are from) This is also incorrect. You need to respect local laws, even if they differ from your home country.
*   **D: Qiyaam parr sabiqah tahqiq sey bachna:** (Avoiding prior research on the stay) The passage implies you *should* research beforehand to be prepared for differences.

Therefore, being willing to try unfamiliar food (and, by extension, be open to new experiences) aligns best with the passage's advice for avoiding disappointment.

"Ebarat mein malumaat ki buniyaad parr, kis qism key shakhs ko kisi kharijee maqam ka safar kartey waqt mayusi ka saamna ho sakta hay?","The correct answer is **C: Band dimaagh shakhs (Closed-minded person)**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of acknowledging and accepting that things will be different when traveling compared to being at home. It specifically mentions differences in customs, rules, food, transportation, living standards, language, and more. The passage warns against frustration and annoyance towards local customs.

A ""band dimaagh shakhs"" is someone who is resistant to new ideas or experiences, and tends to judge other cultures and customs according to the standards of their own. This type of person would likely struggle with the differences encountered during travel and, as the passage suggests, become frustrated and annoyed.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Gair mulki khanon ko pasand karney walaa shakhs (A person who likes foreign food):** This person would likely *enjoy* the differences, not be frustrated by them.
*   **B: Tabdeeli parr pinapney walaa shakhs (A person who thrives on change):** This person is likely adaptable and would embrace the differences encountered while traveling.
*   **D: Taleem sey lutf andoz honey walaa shakhs (A person who enjoys learning):** This person would be open to learning new things and likely appreciate the cultural differences.

Therefore, a closed-minded person is the most likely to experience frustration during travel, based on the information in the passage."
Darjah zail mein sey kon pahli baar taraqqi pazeer mulk ka daurah karney waley mosaafiron key sifaarish kardah mashwarah hay?,"Sawaal mein diye gaye passage ke mutaabiq, pahli baar taraqqi pazeer mulk ka daura karne wale musafiron ke liye sifaarish kardah mashwareh hain:

*   **D: Jab aap pahley pahunchey to ek meyaari hotel mein sarmaya karein** (Passage mein kaha gaya hai: ""Bator khaas apnay ibtadayi dinon mean adat daalnay key liye maghrabi tarz our meyaar key hotel, khaaney our khidmaat purr khoob dill khol kirr kharch karein."")
*   **C: Agar baahar camp karna ho to ek palang yaa jhoola ki sifaarish ki jaati hay** (Passage mein kaha gaya hai: ""Agar aap baahir camp laganay jaarhay hain, to aap apnay aap co saanp, bachho jaisi cheezon say door rakhnay key liye camp kee charpai yaa jhulan kahtol laayein."")

Lehaza, options C aur D dono passage mein sifaarish ki gayi hai. Lekin, agar ek hi option chunna ho, to mujhe lagta hai **D** zyada munasib hai, kyunki yeh ibtidai dinon mein adat daalne ke barey mein ek aam mashwara hai, jabke camp karna ek khaas situation hai."
Darjah zail mein sey kon iss tor parr zikr nahein kiya jaata hay kehh kisi cheez parr taraqqi pazeer mulk sey mowafiqat key waqt nomaesh karna hay?,"Sawaal mein pocha gaya hai ke taraqqi pazeer mulk mein safar karte waqt kiss cheez ke zariye mowafiqat dikhaane ka zikr nahi kiya gaya hai. Paragraph ke mutabiq, maghribi andaaz ka khaana, meyari khidmaat aur meyari hotel ka zikr mowafiqat dikhaane ke taur parr kiya gaya hai. Taham, camp karne ke liye toshak aur pad ka zikr khud ko jaanwaron se bachane ke liye zaroori saman ke taur parr kiya gaya hai, na ke mowafiqat dikhaane ke taur parr.

Isliye, sahih jawab hai:

**C: Camp karney key liye toshak aur pad**

"Darjah zail konsa ikhteyaar eek policy key haamil shakhs key liye behtareen hay jo apni policy ki eek majazi naqal hoti hay, lekin ho sakta hay kehh uss mein internet tak rasaayi na ho?","Correct Answer: **C: Apney laptop ki memory mein store kardah eek naqal ko barqaraar rakhein**

Reasoning:

The question asks for the best option for a digital copy of a policy *without* internet access. Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: Eek safar key saathi ko eek naqal denaa:** While sharing with a travel companion is good, it's a *physical* copy, not a digital one and doesn't address the internet access issue.

*   **B: Khud ko eek naqal email karnaa:** Email requires internet access to retrieve the copy if it's not already downloaded.

*   **C: Apney laptop ki memory mein store kardah eek naqal ko barqaraar rakhein:** Storing the copy directly on the laptop's memory (or hard drive) allows access *without* needing an internet connection. The prompt specifies ""baghair internet qabil rasayi"" (without internet access), which this option directly addresses.

*   **D: “Cloud” mein eek naqal ko store karein:** The ""cloud"" inherently requires internet access.

Therefore, storing the copy on the laptop's memory is the only option that guarantees access to a digital copy without internet."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kisko policy parr dikhney ki zarurat nahein hay?","The correct answer is **D: Policy key haamil shakhs ka email patah**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states you need to show insurers the following for authorization/power of attorney and claims:

*   Insurer's email address (beemadaron ka ayee meal patah)
*   International phone numbers (been alaqwami phone nambaraat)

The passage does not mention the policyholder's email address being necessary for them to show. It only suggests keeping an online copy for your own accessibility.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsa manfi size ziyadah tarr istemaal honey wali film ki wazaa ki akkaasi karta hay?","The passage states: ""meyari 35 aim aim film (36 bayee 24 aim aim manfi) sub say aam hay."" This means the standard 35mm film (with a negative size of 36 x 24 mm) is the most common.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 35 milimeter manfi**. While D is the specific size, option C encompasses the general film type.
"
Darjah zail film ki wazaoon mein sey kon aisi qaraar daad ki peshkash karta hay jo DSLR key momaasil hay?,"The correct answer is **A: 35 milimeter ki film**.

The passage states that 35mm film provides a resolution roughly equivalent to current DSLRs.

"Karobaar likhney waley eek safar shuru kartey waqt, darjah zail konsi salahiyat mumkanah tor parr sabsey pahley nikhaara janaa chahiye?","Sawaal (Q) ka sahih jawaab (A) ""Blog likhnaa"" hai.

Dileel (P) wazeh taur parr kehta hai ke safri tehreer likhnay ka karobaar shuru karnay ka aasaan tareeqah yeh hai ke kasee mustahkam travel blog website par apni salahiyaton ko nikharein. Is ka matlab hai ke shuru mein blog likhnay ki salahiyat ko nikhaarna zaroori hai.
"
Kiss qism key mosam mein aanton waley masayel paye jaatey hein?,"The correct answer is **C: Garam aabo hawa**.

The passage states: ""Jis tarah surd ab woo hawa mean tanfas key masail pesh aate hain asee tarah **garam ab woo hawa mean shakmi masail aam hain**"". This directly translates to ""Just as respiratory problems occur in cold weather, similarly, **abdominal problems are common in hot weather**.""

"Ebaarat key hisaab sey, baqaedah beneqaabi kis cheez ki quwwate modafeat ka sabab ho sakti hay?","Sawal ka sahih jawab hai:

Darjah zail mein sey kon Schengen mintaqah key andar safar kaa faayedah hay?,"Sahi jawab hai: **A, B, aur C**

Di gayi tafseelat ke mutabiq, Schengen mintaqah mein safar karne ke faayde ye hain:

*   **Kaseer visa darkhawaston sey bachnaa:** Aapko har Schengen rakan mulk ke liye alag alag visa ke liye apply nahi karna padta.
*   **Paisa bachanaa:** Alag alag visa fees nahi deni padti.
*   **Kaseer passport control key checkpoint sey bachnaa:** Zyadatar aapko sarhad paar karte waqt baar baar passport control se nahi guzarna padta.

Option D sahi nahi hai, kyunke passport ki zarurat toh hoti hi hai, lekin passport control har baar nahi hota.
"
Tutankhamun key maqbarah mein kiya cheez abb aur nahein payi jaa sakti?,"The correct answer is **D: Daulatein (Treasures)**.

The passage states that the famous treasures from the tomb are no longer there and have been moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Vancouver ki konsi manzil qimat sey bedaar mosaafiron keliye kam az kam jaazib hogee? ","The passage states that Whistler is ""expensive"" (kharchila). Therefore, it would be the least attractive destination for budget-conscious travelers.

So the answer is:

D: Seeti bajaney walaa
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsi manzil bahut mumkanah tor parr mosaafiron ko eek tausiqi Vancouver tajrabah ki peshkash karti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Bowen jazeerah**.

Here's why:

The passage directly states that ""Boyan jazirah kayaking (dongi mean safar karnay), hiking (pedal lambi dori kaa safar karnay), kharidari, rasturan, our bhat kachh pesh karnay waala eek dunn kee seyahat yaa hafta key aakhir mean purlataf safar keliye mashhur hay."" This indicates Bowen Island offers a variety of activities and is a popular destination for short trips and weekend getaways. It is also near Vancouver and easily accessible. Therefore, it's the most likely location to provide a truly ""Vancouver"" experience due to its accessibility and described attractions.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, agar mosaafir bila rok tok waley manazir haasil kar rahey hein to unhein kabb Falls ka daurah karna chahiye?","The passage states that during the rainy season (November to March), the water volume is so high that the view of the falls is obscured. Therefore, to get unobstructed views, travelers should visit outside the rainy season. This means the best answer is:

*   **D: barish waley season key baahar** (Outside the rainy season)"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, navambar aur march key darmiyaan Victoria Falls ka daurah karney ka ultaa kiya hay?","The correct answer is **A: Falls key gair wazeh manazir (Falls' unclear/obscured views)**

The passage states: ""Doosri jaanib, paani kee maqdar atnee zakhim hay kahh asl aabshaar kaa nazrah tumhari aankh say aujhal how jaataa hay - atnaa paani hay!"" This translates to: ""On the other hand, the amount of water is so immense that the actual view of the waterfall is hidden from your eyes - there's so much water!""

Therefore, the drawback of visiting Victoria Falls between November and March, according to the passage, is the obscured view of the falls."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kiski film key liye drone istemaal kartey waqt sifaarish ki jaati hay?","The correct answer is **A: Peshgi yehh padtaal karnaa kehh aap ko film key liye ijazat hay (Check in advance whether you are allowed to film)**

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states: ""Agar aap drone istemaal kartay hain too pehle hee achhi tarah jaanch kirr lain kahh aap cow kunn cheezon kee film bananay kee ajazat hay..."" (If you are using a drone, check in advance what things you are allowed to film...)

While options B and C are related, option A directly addresses the core recommendation of proactively verifying permissions *before* filming. Option D contradicts the advice given in the text, which warns against flying drones over crowds."
"Ebarat key hiaab sey, eek drone istemaal kenrtey huey film key liye behtareen maqamaat kahaan hein?","The correct answer is **D: Aisey elaqon mein jis keliye aap nein pahley sey ijazat ley rakhi hay (In areas for which you have already obtained permission).**

Here's why:

* **P emphasizes permission:** The passage explicitly states ""Agar aap drone istemaal kartay hain too pehle hee achhi tarah jaanch kirr lain kahh aap cow kunn cheezon kee film bananay kee ajazat hay our kunn ajazat naamon our izaafi licence kee zaroorat hay. (If you are using a drone, you should first check what things you are allowed to film and what permits and additional licenses are required.)""  This highlights the crucial importance of obtaining necessary permissions before filming with a drone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aisee bheed key paas jo drone ki mojudgi sey parishaan nahein hoti hein (Near a crowd that is not disturbed by the presence of drones)** - The text mentions it is a bad idea to fly a drone over a crowd, even if it's not illegal.  Being *un*disturbed doesn't override the inherent risk and potential illegality.
* **B: Aisey elaqon mein jahaan baqaeddh photography ki ijazat nahein hay (In areas where regular photography is not allowed)** - The passage states that rules stricter for photography are *even stricter* for video. Therefore, if you can't take pictures, you *definitely* shouldn't be taking video.
* **C: Masruf jaghon mein jahaan drone kam maryee hota hay (In busy places where the drone is less visible)** - Trying to hide or make a drone less visible is a sign of trying to get away with something you shouldn't be doing. Also, the passage warns against flying over busy areas.

"Ebarat ki buniyaad, visa amal ki registory ki zarurat key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah sahee naein hay?","The correct answer is **B: Tamaam mamalik ko maqami hukkaam sey inderaaj karanaa zaruri hay.**

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""kachh mamalik mean, aap cow maqami hakaam key paas apni maujudgi...darj kirana hota hay."" This implies that *not all* countries require registration with local authorities.
*   The other options (A, C, and D) are directly supported by information in the passage.

Therefore, statement B is the only one that is *not* true based on the text.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon eek aisi jagah nahein hay jahaan inderaaj ko sanbhaalney key liye eek sayyah ko janaa ho sakta hay?,"Sawaal mein diye gaye ma'lumat ke mutabiq, ek sayyah ko registration ke liye darj zail jaghon par jana pad sakta hai:

*   **B: Jiss hotel mein woh tharey huey hein** (Paragraph mein zikr hai ke aksar hotels registration ka intezaam karte hain)
*   **D: Muntaqili officein** (Paragraph mein zikr hai ke immigration ke daftar jana pad sakta hai)

Is liye, sahih jawab hai:

*   **C: Ek maqami post office** (Iska zikr paragraph mein nahin hai)

Safar karney key doraan kisko razakaranah kaam karney fayedah nahein hogaa?,"Sawaal Q pooch raha hay kah kisko safar key doraan razakarana kaam karney say fayedah nahein hoga. Mazmoon P batata hay kah razakarana kaam karna mukhtalif tehzeeb woo saqafat say mutaarif honey, nayey logon say milnay, apnay baaray mean jaannay, nazaryaat mahsus karnay, our nayi maharatein haasil karnay keliye mufeed hay.

Ab hum ikhtyarat ka tajziyah kurnay hain:

*   **A: Naye dost bananey ki ummid rakhney waley kisi shakhs ko bairune mulk janaa hoga:** Yeah ikhtyaar durust nahein hay, keunkah mazmoon P kehta hay kah razakarana kaam karna nayey logon say milnay keliye achcha hay.

*   **B: Kaafi tankhawah ki talaash karney walaa koyi shakhs:** Yeah ikhtyaar durust how sakta hay. mazmoon P kehta hay kah baz razakarana mulazimatein mukhtasir tankhwah deeti hain, leakin koi bhee ""kaafi tankhawah"" kaa zikar nahein kartaa hay. agar koyi shakhs sirf tankhawah hi talash kar raha hay, too ussay razakarana kaam karney say fayedah nahein hoga.

*   **C: Nayee maharat haasil karney ki ummid rakhney walaa koyi shakhs:** Yeah ikhtyaar durust nahein hay, keunkah mazmoon P kehta hay kah razakarana kaam karna nayi maharatein haasil karnay keliye achcha hay.

*   **D: Koyi aisa shakhs jo ho sakta hay kehh kamrah ya bairune mulk mein dilchaspi na rakhta ho:** Yaeh durust how sakta hay. agar kisi ki bereun mulk jane mein dilchaspi nahein hay ya wo kamrah mein arama deh mehsoos nahein karta too wah razakarana kaam karney se mutmaeen nahein hoga.

Isliye, option **B** Aur **D** dorast how saktay hein. Lakin, option **B** ziyadah durust hay, kyunkeh mazmoon wazeh taur per batata hay keh razakarana kaam main tankhawah bahut kam hotih hay.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, bairune mulk hotey huey razakaranah kaam karnaa kisi bajat waley mosaafir key liye fayedah mand kaisey hay?","The correct answer is **C: Kamrah aur board ki baaz auqaat pesh kash ki jaati hay** (Room and board are sometimes offered).

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""...kayee razakarana mulazimatein rehaish our khaana farahim kurti hain our chand mukhtasir tankhwah bhee deeti hain-"" which translates to ""...many volunteer jobs provide accommodation and food and even a small salary."" Therefore, accommodation and food are provided in some instances.
*   Option A is incorrect since the original passage states, ""...chand mukhtasir tankhwah bhee deeti hain"", meaning that only *some* volunteer roles provide a small salary.
*   Options B and D are benefits of volunteering abroad, but they don't directly address how it benefits a budget traveler specifically, which is what the question asks. Option C highlights the benefit of volunteering, where expenses such as rent and groceries are either fully or partially covered.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss cheez ko Walt Disney duniyaa key motawassit safar eek aam samjhaa jaa skata hay?","The correct answer is **C: Disney ki jayedaad parr mokammal safar guzaarna**.

The passage states: ""Misali doray mean aurlendo been alaqwami tairaan gah purr parwazein,aan saait ddezni hotel mean masrufiyat, ddezni malkiyat cow turk kiye baghair taqriba eek hafta guzarna, our waps ghar lotna shaamil hay."" This translates to: ""The ideal trip includes flying into Orlando International Airport, staying at an on-site Disney hotel, spending about a week without leaving Disney property, and then returning home.""

Therefore, spending the entire trip on Disney property is the most common (misali) or standard (ideal) expectation for a Walt Disney World trip.
"
Walt Disney duniya key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sahee nahein hay?,"Let's analyze each statement based on the provided passage:

*   **A: Paark ki ummid rakhney waley ticket deegar mosaafiron keliye qabiley mutaqili nahein hein (Park tickets are not transferable to other travelers)**: This statement is **TRUE** according to the passage: ""dazni nay iss cow mamnua qaraar diyaa hawa hay: ticket qaabil manqali nahein hain (Disney has prohibited this: tickets are not transferable).""

*   **B: Site parr rehaaesh dastiyaab hay (Accommodation is available on-site)**: This statement is **TRUE** as the passage mentions ""aan saait ddezni hotel mean masrufiyat (staying at an on-site Disney hotel).""

*   **C: Airport sey jayedaad tak ley jaaney key liye busein dastiyaab hein (Buses are available to take you from the airport to the property)**: This is not specifically stated in the passage. Although the passage mentions that trips to Disney World often start at the Orlando International Airport ( ""Misali doray mean aurlendo been alaqwami tairaan gah purr parwazein""), the passage does not explicit say that busses are available to take you to the property.

*   **D: Kaseer ayyam key ticket aksar boli ki websiton parr paye jaatey hein (Multi-day tickets are often found on auction websites)**: This statement is **TRUE** according to the passage: ""Nilami kee web sites jaisakah ebay yaa craigslist key zariye aan line farokhat kiye gaye bhat say tickets jazwi toor purr istemaal kardah milti day hopper tickets hain (Many tickets sold online through auction websites such as eBay or Craigslist are partially used multi-day hopper tickets).""

Therefore, the statement that is NOT explicitly supported by the text is **C**.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail konsey masalah ka bahut mumkanah tor parr peshah waranah tarbiyat key class yaa ishaaton mein ehaatah nahein kiya jaa sakta hay?","Sawaal P mein saaf taur par kaha gaya hai ke ""nisab mein yahaan batayegay tamaam masail kaa tafsil say, aam toor purr mashqi tajarbah key saath ahatah kiya jaye gaa... asmein role play, bhat say frist aid our kabhi kabhaar hathiyaron kee training bhee shaamil hogi."" Is se zahir hota hai ke kirdaar adaa karna (role play) aur pahley taawun ki tayyaari (frist aid) training mein shaamil hain. Jang key mintaqah ki tayyaari bhi nisab ka hissa hai kyunke poora paragraph hi is barey mein hai.

Lekin sawal P mein ye bhi kaha gaya hai ke ""Veeranay kee baqaa say mutaliq kitabein our rasayal aam hain, leakin jangi elaqon say mutaliq matbuaat cum hain."" Is se zahir hota hai ke jungali zindagi ki baqaa (jangali jeevan bachane ki tayyari) ke barey mein ziyada materials available hain, lekin ye zaroori nahi hai ke ye peshah waranah tarbiyat key class yaa ishaaton mein shaamil ho.

Isliye, sahih jawab hay:

**A: Jangali zindagi ki baqaa**

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail konsey mauzu ka eek peshah waranah tarbiyat ki class mein ehaatah kiya jaa sakta hay?","The passage states: ""...Eek nisab aam toor purr 2-5 dunon kaa hoga our asmein role play, bhat say **frist aid** our kabhi kabhaar hathiyaron kee training bhee shaamil hogi.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Pahla taawun (First Aid)**
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, mumkanah aaludah paani sey bacchney key liye behtareen ikhteyaar kia hay?","The passage suggests that boiling water for a minute is sufficient in some areas, but not everywhere. It also mentions that filters vary in effectiveness. The most reliable method mentioned in the passage to avoid potentially contaminated water is to buy bottled water from a reputable company.

Therefore, the best answer is **B: Botal ka paani kharidein (Buy bottled water)**.
"
"Ebaarat key hisaab sey, konsi cheez qareebi tor parr mumkin ho sakti hay neez maahir tairaakon key liye?","The passage states that swimming against the current of a rip current is likely impossible and causes exhaustion, leading to fatalities. Therefore, swimming against the current (Option C) is *not* something even expert swimmers are likely to be able to do successfully.

The passage does imply that waiting to be rescued is a possibility for expert swimmers, or for those with given flotation devices (""cow notes""). This indirectly suggests that *avoiding* fighting the current and potentially drifting to deeper water (Option B) and waiting for rescue is a more viable strategy for experts, and therefore, deeper water would have to be somewhere they could survive.

The most likely answer, therefore, is **B: Gahrey paani mein tairnaa**. While the passage doesn't directly *state* it's possible, it is inferred from the suggestion that experienced swimmers with floatation devices could wait for rescue after being pulled into the deeper water where the currents are strong.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B**.
"
Agar aap bahao mein fans jayein to aap ko kiya karnaa chahiye?,"The correct answer is **C: Mokhaalif samt mein tairnaa** (Swim in the opposite direction).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ziyadah ther amwaat paani key dhaar key khalaaf ternay kee koshish...kee wajah say paida honey waali thakawat key natijay mean hoti hain."" (Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion from trying to swim against the current...). This implies that swimming *against* the current is the wrong approach.

* **The passage also states:** ""Jaise hee tham dhaaray say nikal aaogay waisay hee teraki hasbi mamool aasaan nahein how jaye gee."" (As soon as you get out of the grip of the current, swimming will not be easy as usual). This suggests that the goal is to escape the current first.

* **Option A is incorrect:** while it eventually suggests swimming back to shore normally, the first part ""Doosri samt ka maqsad lekar bahao sey nikalney ki koshish karnaa"" is vague and doesn't give concrete direction, while C is clearer.

* **Option B is incorrect:** It goes against the advice in the passage.

* **Option D is incorrect:** There is nothing in the passage to support this.

Therefore, swimming ""mokhaalif samt mein"" (in the opposite direction) from the flow of the current, and then try swim to the shore, is the recommended action.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss mahalle waqoo mein kisi mahal ka daurah eek qabiley qadar chutti ka safar hogaa?","The correct answer is **C: Rhine waadi mein**.

The passage specifically mentions ""kawair veeli yaa raain veeli mean qalaon kee ziyarat"" (Kawair Valley or Rhine Valley for visiting castles). Therefore, the Rhine Valley is presented as a valuable vacation trip location according to the passage.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon uss elaqah mein safar karney wali khawateen key liye sifarish kardah noktah hogaa?","The passage provides the following advice for women traveling in the region:

*   Claim to be married regardless of actual marital status.
*   Wear a ring (not necessarily an expensive one).
*   Be aware that cultural differences may lead to misunderstandings (being followed, grabbed).
*   Be firm in rejecting unwanted advances and don't be afraid to stand your ground.

Now let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Mawaad ki haalat sey bachna (Avoiding material situations):** This is not directly mentioned. While not wearing expensive jewelry is advised, the focus is on *appearing* married, not avoiding situations where you might be robbed.

*   **B: Iss baat sey aagah rahein kehh saqafati ekhtelafaat maqaami logon key taaqatwar rawayyah ko uksaa saktey hein (Be aware that cultural differences may trigger forceful behavior from local men):** This aligns perfectly with the passage, which warns about the possibility of being followed or grabbed due to cultural differences and emphasizes the need to be firm in rejecting advances.

*   **C: Chamakdaar zewar pahananey sey bachein (Avoid wearing shiny jewelry):** This is a part of the advice, but not the central point. It's secondary to appearing married and being aware of cultural differences.

*   **D: Jabb zarurat ho sakhti ka istemaal karein (Use strictness when needed):** This is related to the advice to be firm in rejecting advances, but the primary advice is about awareness and preventative measures.

Therefore, the best answer is **B**, as it encompasses the broader understanding of the potential cultural differences that might lead to problems.
"
Ebarat mein wazahat kardah elaqah ki buniyaad parr khawateen mosaafiron key liye madadgaar noktah kiya hogaa?,"The best answer based on the provided text is **D: Gair matlubah taraqqiyon ki surat mein thukraaney waley mardon key saath saabit qadam rahein.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of women being firm and not backing down when rejecting unwanted advances.** It states ""Mardon cow manaa karnay key baaray mean sakht rahoo our apnay moaqif purr datay rehney say math draw"" (Be strict about refusing men and don't be afraid to stand your ground).

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Shanakht karein kehh iss ki pairawee karnaa aam nahein hay:** This is partially true. Understanding that certain behaviors are not normal is helpful, but the text focuses more on *how* to respond to those behaviors, not just recognizing them.
* **B: Martial haalat ki alaamat bataney key liye eek badi anguthi pahnein:** The text mentions wearing a ring, but it explicitly states that it doesn't need to be overly expensive. The primary recommendation is to *claim* to be married, regardless of actual marital status. A large ring isn't necessarily required, and this isn't the core advice.
* **C: Samjhein kehh saqafati ekhtelafaat iss baat ki tajweez kartey hein kehh aap apni zameen parr khadey honey sey bachein:** This is the *opposite* of what the text advises. The text states that cultural differences might explain certain behaviors, but it *explicitly* says that this doesn't excuse them and that women should stand their ground.
"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, kis manzar naamah ko darkaar hay kehh eek jangali zindagi ka photographer eek khaas lens ka istemaal karey?","The correct answer is **A: Agar wohh khaas tor parr chotee makhluqaat ki tasweer ley rahey hon**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""...halanki parindon key jhund yaa ek chhoti makhluq jaisi cheezon key liye dosray lens kee zaroorat hoti hay."" This directly implies that a different lens (not the long telephoto) is needed for photographing small creatures or flocks of birds.
The other options aren't directly tied to needing a specific lens:

*   B: While commercial photography in parks might have regulations, it doesn't necessitate a specific lens.
*   C: A shy animal doesn't directly dictate the type of lens needed, although it might influence other aspects of the photographer's approach.
*   D: Park rules might exist, but they don't necessarily mean a specific lens is required."
Darjah zail mein sey kiska ebaarat mein jangali zindagi key photographer key liye mumkanah challenge tor parr zikr nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Matlubah lens ki qism ko Source karnaa**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Makhsus gair mulki janwaron ki talaash karnaa** (Finding specific foreign animals): The passage mentions that finding rare animals is difficult.
*   **B: Jarehaanah janwaron key saath bartao karnaa** (Dealing with aggressive animals): The passage states that wild animals can be shy or aggressive.
*   **D: Mumkanah mokhaalefanah mahaul mein kaam karnaa** (Working in potentially adverse environments): The passage mentions that the environment can be cold, hot, or otherwise hostile.

The passage *does* mention needing good equipment, including different lenses, but it **doesn't** specifically say that *finding* the right lens is a challenge. The challenge lies in using the right equipment and dealing with difficult animals and environments."
Darjah zail mein sey kon mumkanah tor parr pahaadi guzar gaahon mein safar kerney waley kisi driver key liye kam az kam masayel ki wajah bann sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Bhaari traffic**

Here's why:

*   **B: Kam ragad (Low friction):** The passage explicitly states low friction on icy and snowy roads is a problem.
*   **C: Hadd sey ziyaadah kasafat (Excessive condensation):** The passage mentions condensation or ice on windows reducing visibility, so this is a problem.
*   **D: Kam kardah mariyat (Reduced visibility):** The passage mentions snow, ice, or condensation reducing visibility, so this is also a problem.
*   **A: Bhaari traffic (Heavy traffic):** Heavy traffic can be a problem in general, but it is not specifically mentioned as a winter weather hazard in the passage.

Therefore, **Bhaari traffic** is the least likely of the listed issues for a driver traveling through mountain passes."
Mukhtalif mamalik mein aamdani tax key baarey mein kisko mustaqil rahnaa mumkin hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Saakht (Structure)**.

The passage discusses how the income tax system is structured differently in different countries. This includes variations in tax rates, brackets, and whether taxes are levied at federal and local levels. The ""saakht"" (structure) of the income tax system is what determines these differences.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, agar aap bairune mulk rahtey lekin kisi aur jagah ki buniyaad parr, kahaan aap mumkanah tor parr apna aamadni tax darj kar rahey hongey?","Sahi jawab hai: **C: Jiss mulk mein aap filhaal kaam kar rahey hein**

Yeh jawaab ibarat ke pehle jumlay mein bataye gaye usool se mel khata hai, jo yeh batata hai ke agar aap safeer nahin hain, to aap jis mulk mein kaam kar rahe hain, wahan aapko apna income tax jama karna hoga.

Konsa darjah zail bayaniyah durust tor parr eek duniya key meley ki wazahat karta hay?,"Let's analyze each option based on the provided text:

*   **A: Nazarey eek mulk ki tareekh aur saqafat ko dikha sakti hay** (Sights can showcase a country's history and culture) - The passage states that participating countries ""highlighted their country's culture and history"" in their national pavilions. This is a direct reflection of the text.

*   **B: Nabataati nazaron ko fankaranah aur taleemi nazaron key saath dikhaya jaye** (Botanical sights can be showcased along with artistic and educational sights) - The passage mentions ""floral displays, botanical gardens and displays of plant-related things"" in connection with international horticulture exhibitions, which are part of world fairs. It also says that the pavilions display ""artistic and educational displays."" This implies botanical sights are displayed separately, but alongside the artistic and educational displays in general.

*   **C: Taqribaat chah mahinon tak jaari rah sakti hein** (Events can last up to six months) - The passage states that these events ""usually last from three to six months."" This directly matches the statement.

*   **D: Mulkon ko shirkat karney ki zarurat nahein hay** (Countries don't need to participate) - The passage talks about ""participating countries,"" implying that participation is optional, but does not definitively confirm it.

While options A and C are directly stated and correct, B requires inference. Therefore, both A and C are the most appropriate answers. If only one answer is required, **A** is likely the best answer as the text more strongly emphasizes the cultural and historical displays."
Darjah zail mein sey kon duniya key melah yaa aalami nomaesh qanoon hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Nazaron ko mulk ki tareekh aur aalami masayel dono ko dikhanaa zaruri hay**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Shirkat karnay waale mamalik nay aalamgir masail yaa apnay milk kee saqafat our tareekh cow ajagar karnay key liye qomi povilienz mean fankarana our taleemi mazahire pesh kiye."" This translates to ""Participating countries present artistic and educational displays in national pavilions to highlight global issues *or* their country's culture and history."" While the passage uses ""or,"" showing both is strongly implied as a purpose. It's the closest statement to a ""rule"" mentioned in the text.
Let's look at the other options:

*   **B: Salanah buniyaad parr eek hi mulk taqribaat ki mezbaani nahein kar sakta:** The passage mentions the event *theoretically* could happen every year in different countries, implying a country *could* host more than once, just not necessarily consecutively. This is an implication, not a hard rule.
*   **C: Taqribaat ko chah mahinon tak jaari rahna zaruri hay:** The passage says these events ""amuman then say chh maah thak jaari rehte hain,"" meaning they *usually* last three to six months. It doesn't state it's a *requirement*.
*   **D: Melah key muaqid honey key liye, tamaam mamalik ko shirkat karna zaruri hay:** The passage doesn't say *all* countries must participate. It only describes what *participating* countries do.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate based on the provided text."
Darjha zail mein sey kiya karney sey kisi janwar key hamlah ka imkaan kam ho jayegaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Camp ki site sey kudaa hatanaa (Removing garbage from the campsite)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""badbudar khaana reechh our dosray jungli janwaron cow raghib karta hay"" (smelly food attracts bears and other wild animals). Removing garbage from the campsite reduces the smell and therefore reduces the likelihood of attracting animals and being attacked.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Khusbudaar jadi buti lekar janaa (Bringing fragrant herbs):** The passage does not discuss fragrant herbs.
*   **C: Bhediyon sey 25 gaz faselah rakhnaa (Maintaining a 25-yard distance from wolves):** The passage specifically states that you should keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, not 25 yards.
*   **D: Khaney key tukdey ki madad sey janwaron ko roknaa (Stopping animals with pieces of food):** The passage explicitly warns against feeding or approaching the animals.

Therefore, the best way to reduce the chance of an animal attack is to eliminate attractants like food waste by keeping your campsite clean."
Darjah zail mein sey kiska ebarat mein jangali zindagi key hamlon ki mumkanah wajah key tor parr zikr nahein kiya gaya hay?,"Correct answer is **D: Insaanon key saath gair maanus janwar**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Tez boo (Strong odor):** The passage mentions that strong-smelling food attracts bears and other wildlife.

*   **B: Fasalah barqaraar rakhney mein nakaam (Failure to maintain distance):** The passage explicitly states that visitors get injured each year because they don't maintain a safe distance.

*   **C: Jangali janwar ko khilanaa (Feeding wild animals):** The passage warns against feeding or bothering the animals.

*   **D: Insaanon key saath gair maanus janwar (Animals unfamiliar with humans):** The passage states that many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, but wild animals are still wild. The problem is not their unfamiliarity with humans, but their inherent wild nature.
