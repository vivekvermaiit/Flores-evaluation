"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, accordion hpe awngdang ai hku dum lu na matu hpa hpe tup hkrak teng ai hpaji jaw ai lam ngu nlu sawn ai rai?","The passage gives advice on playing the accordion:

*   Minimize unnecessary movements in your hands.
*   Ensure accuracy in hitting notes.
*   Reduce tension in your hands.
*   Remember to use force to press the keys.
*   Use more force or faster bellows to get louder sounds.

The question asks which of the options is a correct piece of advice for successfully playing the accordion, based on the passage.

Let's analyze the options:

*   A: ""Nsen kahtap nna sharawt na matu, lata dip shara ni hpe dip ai n-gun shawrawt u"" translates to ""Increase the force when pressing the keys to increase the volume."" This aligns with the advice to use more force to press keys (like a piano) to get louder sounds.
*   B: ""Na a ningja lam hpe mazing lu na matu n ra ai shamu shamawt lam ni hpe shayawm u"" translates to ""Minimize unnecessary movements to maintain your posture"".  This aligns with the advice to minimize unnecessary hand movements.
*   C: ""Simsa ai lata hpe mazing let nsi note ni hpe jaw hkra dum na matu sadi u"" translates to ""Make sure to hit the notes accurately while maintaining relaxed hands."" This aligns with advice to hit notes accurately and avoid tension.
*   D: ""Nsen shaja na matu bellow ni hpe grau lawan ai hku dum u"" translates to ""To make the sound louder, blow the bellows faster.""  This matches the advice that you need to use more force or faster bellows to get louder sounds.

All the options are indeed correct, but option B is not directly correlated to accordion playing. Options A, C, and D are specific to playing the accordion. Given the context of the question, we're looking for advice directly related to playing the instrument successfully. It's possible that the original text is interpreted incorrectly.

Out of the options, the MOST direct and specific advice from the text is **D: Nsen shaja na matu bellow ni hpe grau lawan ai hku dum u** because it specifically addresses how to change the loudness of the sound of the accordion by how you use the bellows.
The correct answer is **D**.
"
"Accordion dum ai ten hta, npu na gara wa mahtang gaw nsen shatsaw na matu karum ya ai kun?","The correct answer is **B: N-gun grau law na**

The passage states: ""Accordion madum sumpyi hta nsen shaja na matu bellow ni hpe n-gun grau shadat nna (sh) grau lawan ai hku pat let dum ra ai."" This translates to ""To increase the volume on the accordion, you need to push the bellows with more force **(n-gun grau law na)** or close them faster (grau lawan ai hku).""
"
Hkrangmu nsen lamang na sumla ni gaw hpa majaw makau ndung ni hpe di da ai kun?,"The correct answer is **B: Sumla hpe TV pat man hta hpring hkra mu lu na matu**.

The passage explains that TV shows are designed to be cropped and zoomed in to fit standard TV screens. This is done to fill the entire screen and prevent black bars on the sides. The passage says ""nang TV kaw mu ai lam yawng gaw shi shingwang kata rep, lahta, npu, maga ga de ni sha re"" which means ""everything you see on TV is zoomed in and cropped on all sides.""
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu de na gara wa mahtang gaw sumla hkrung hpe DVD hkrang galai ai ten hta mayak ni nga ai kun?","The best answer is **B: Adaw achyen re ai sumla hkrung npu na laika ni** and **D: makau ndung di da ai**.

Here's why:

*   **B: Adaw achyen re ai sumla hkrung npu na laika ni** The passage specifically mentions that ""lama na sumla hkrung kaw laika madun ai shaloi npu de grai kap taw nna shanhte hpe yawng nmai madun na ra ai."" This directly describes a problem of cut-off subtitles.
*   **D: makau ndung di da ai** The passage clearly states ""nang DVD galaw ai shaloi, shi a makau ndung ni hpe di kau na zawn re nga ai."" This means the sides are cropped off.

Let's look at why the other options are not as good:

*   **A: TV pat man hta yawng nlu jahpring ai sumla** While letterboxing (black bars at the top and bottom) *can* be a problem, the passage doesn't primarily focus on that issue. It emphasizes the problems caused by overscan and cropping.

*   **C: TV pat man yawng hpring taw ai sumla** This is the *goal* of overscan, not a problem it causes during DVD conversion.

So, while A *could* be a minor issue, B and D are the direct problems described. If I had to pick just one, B or D would be the best answer. Since the question allows for selection of more than one answer, B and D would be selected."
British mare sin dap gaw gara kaw nga lai wa ai kun?,"The correct answer is **C: Bordentown**.

The passage states, ""Du daju John Cadwalder gaw hpyen n-gun jat ai lam hpe hkum pat jahkring na matu Bordentown na British maren sin dap hpe lam galai gumlang gasat na matu tsun shabra na re."" This translates to ""Brigadier General John Cadwalder would command a diversionary attack against the British garrison at Bordentown to prevent them from reinforcing Trenton.""
"
Lata hte ka ai laika hprang hta kadai na lata masat sen hpe mu lu ai kun?,"The correct answer is **A: John Hancock**.

The passage states: ""rapdaw tingnyang up John Hancock gaw dai lata hte ka ai laika nhprang hpe lakmat htu"" which translates to ""President of Congress John Hancock signed the handwritten original document"".
"
"Lawu e jaw da ai shara ni hta, Dunlap ga uru dat ai lam gaw hpang jahtum du wa ai rai?","Let's analyze the passage to determine where the ""Dunlap broadsides"" arrived last:

*   **Dunlap's printing shop:** The passage states Charles Thomson sent the handwritten manuscript to John Dunlap's printing shop immediately after Hancock signed it. So this is very early in the distribution.
*   **Independence Square:** John Nixon read a copy publicly in Independence Square on July 8th.
*   **New York:** George Washington received a copy and had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th.
*   **London:** A copy was sent to London on August 10th.

Therefore, the Dunlap broadside arrived last in London.

**So the correct answer is C: London**"
Dap jum up Stark na hpyen hpung ni gara kaw nga ai kun?,"The passage states: ""Stark a hpyen la ni gaw Mung maden hpyen ni shara la da ai dingdung jahtum maga na nhpan hku shara la bang wa ma ai."" This translates to: ""Stark's soldiers took positions in a fortification at the northernmost edge where the British soldiers had taken positions.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Nhpan ding yang, dingdung jahtum kaw** (Inside the fortification, at the northernmost edge).
"
Matsing masat ga hta tsun da ai hte maren dap jum Stark gaw galoi kaw nna shanhte a nhpan ni hpe maden jat la da ai kun?,"The correct answer is **C: Hka yawm ai ten hta**.

The passage states: ""Hka hpungrawt nem mat ai a majaw Mystic hka nu kaw na hpang na zundawn a sinpraw dingdung maga du hkra gang hkat mat ai aten hta shanhte gaw nhpan hpe nlung tawng hte galaw da ai shakum hte dingdung maga, panglai hka kau mayan de du hkra lawan ladan matut kau ma ai.""

This clearly indicates they extended their base when the water level was low.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu kaw lawm ai ni hta na gara wa gaw Miwa mung a gumshen dik ai aten ladaw gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **D: The Three Kingdoms ladaw**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ndai """"""""The Three Kingdoms"""""""" ngu ai aten ladaw gaw Miwa labau a sai hkaw htum aten langai rai nga ai."" (This ""The Three Kingdoms"" period was one of the bloodiest periods in Chinese history.)
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, ayan htawt hkawm ai madang de shang wa ai kagyin hpung hte seng nna gara gaw jaw ai rai?","Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **B: Shanhte hta lusha madi shadaw ai lam n law ai**.

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Lusha mai lu ai lam yawm wa ai ten mung maden ai gaw ladaw jahkring hkring hta byin wa ai."" This directly translates to: ""When food availability is low, expansion happens in stages/periods."" This indicates a lack of ample food supply.

Let's look at why the other options are not as accurate:

*   **A: Shanhte gaw shana ten hta tsip ai** This is not a completely accurate statement from the provided information. The text says ""gagyin hpyen hpung ni gaw shana hkawm nna shani hkring ma ai,"" meaning ""the gagyin soldiers travel at night and rest during the day.""
*   **C: Shanhte gaw 17 ya ngut ai hpang galai ai tsip hpe galaw ma ai** The text only mentions ""ntsa lam nhtoi 17 na ai"" which roughly translates to ""17 days of surface light"". This could mean the travel time is 17 days. It does not explicitly connect to changing shifts (tsip).
*   **D: Shanhte gaw shani e yan hkawm ma ai** The text stated that ""gagyin hpyen hpung ni gaw shana hkawm nna shani hkring ma ai,"" meaning ""the gagyin soldiers travel at night and rest during the day.""

Therefore, option B is the most accurate based on the given information."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, ayan htawt hkawm ai madang de shang wa ai kagyin hpung ni a tsip ai akyang hte seng nna gara gaw tup hkrak nlu tsun ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Shanhte gaw shanu shara hpe shani shagu galai ma ai**

Here's why:

*   **P states**: ""Ndai ladaw ni hta mung maden ai gaw shani shagu na htawt sit galai taw ai jahkring mi na tsip tsip hpa re nga ai"" - This directly translates to, ""During these periods of migration, building is a temporary thing, with a shift/change of location every day.""

Therefore, Option C most accurately reflects the passage."
Kaga shinggan na karum lam ni nga ai rai tim npu na lam ni kaw nna gara gaw matut nna galaw sa na kun?,"The correct answer is **C: Hkumhkrang shingra ten (Biological rhythms)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that biological rhythms are self-sustaining oscillators that can continue functioning for about 24 hours without external cues.
*   The question asks what continues to function ""despite"" external help. This directly aligns with the self-sustaining nature of biological rhythms described in the passage.
*   The other options are related to the topic, but they do not describe the continuous function nature as explicitly as biological rhythms do."
Hkrang kumla bung amyu a laklai ai sat lawat nbung ai lam hpe madun ai hkum ding dek ni hpe gawn dan ai ga si gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Polymorphic**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dinghkrai shagu gaw alak mi re lai nsam a shai ai lam grai law hpe madun ai ten, shanhte gaw hkrang amyu myu galai ma ai."" This translates to ""When individuals show a lot of variation in their traits, they are polymorphic.""

* **Polymorphic** means having many different forms or traits.

The other options are incorrect:

* **Monomorphic:** Means having only one form or trait (the opposite of what the passage describes).
* **Sak hkrung kanu ni (Hkrung kanu ni):** Refers to genes, not the variation in traits.
* **Amyu baw hpan:** Means species.
"
Npu e madun da ai kaw nna gara gaw laksan shara shanu ai sak hkrung kanu ni a jaw ai ga si rai?,"The passage states that if individuals within a population show great variation in traits, they are considered ""polymorphic."" Therefore, the answer is:

**D: Polymorphic**
"
Npu e jaw tawn da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw shingra mahta ai bu hkawm ai lam a ga shadawn nre rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Hpung tang madun gawk hta hkawm chyai ai**.

Here's why:

*   **Shingra mahta ai bu hkawm magam bungli (Nature-based tourism)** focuses on activities that occur in natural environments and are intended to be environmentally friendly.

Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: Hka rum kaba de lagaw lam bum lung ai (Hiking in a large river):** This is a nature-based activity.
*   **B: Nam na nampan ni hpe sumla gayet la ai (Photographing orchids in the forest):** This is also a nature-based activity that aligns with the description.
*   **C: Hpung tang madun gawk hta hkawm chyai ai (Visiting a museum):** Museums are typically indoor, man-made environments. This doesn't involve experiencing or interacting with nature directly.
*   **D: Nga hkwi ai (Fishing):** Fishing is a nature-based activity.

Therefore, visiting a museum is the only option that is not an example of nature-based tourism."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw htaw wa htaw sa lam a npawt madung re ai kun?","The passage states that ""this fast-paced transportation relies on the individual use of vehicles"". Therefore, the core of the transportation system described is **individual vehicles**.

So the answer is **B: Dinghkrai mawdaw ni (Individual vehicles)**.
"
Nucleus hpe shinggrup ai particle ni hta kaning re ai dat shingrun ni lawm ai kun?,"The passage states:

*   Protons have a positive charge (""proton kaw wan dat nga ai"").
*   Electrons have a negative charge (""Electron kaw gaw wan dat yi nga ai"").

The question asks about the charge of particles that *orbit the nucleus*. The particles that orbit the nucleus are electrons.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **C: Wan yi data** (Negative charge)"
Nucleus hpe hpa dat particle ni hte galaw da ai kun?,"The correct answer is **A: Proton hte neutron ni**.

The passage states: ""Nucleus hta neutrons hte protons ngu ai ayun ayaw lahkawng nga ai."" which directly translates to ""The nucleus contains two types of particles, neutrons and protons.""
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw tawn da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw bit manga nga ai binary nambat a ga shadawn re ai kun?","The correct answer is **C: 10010**

Here's why:

*   **Binary Numbers:** The prompt states that binary numbers use only 0 and 1.
*   **Five Bits:** The question asks for a binary number with five bits (digits).

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: 1010** - This is a binary number, but it only has four bits.
*   **B: 12001** - This is not a binary number because it contains the digits '2'.
*   **C: 10010** - This is a binary number and has five bits.
*   **D: 110101** - This is a binary number, but it has six bits.

Therefore, only option C meets both criteria."
Ruhkum 0 hte 1 hpe gara hku naw lakap ai kun?,"The correct answer is **A: Bit ni**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that binary numbers, which use 0 and 1, are ""daw lahkawng lawm ai ruhkum ni"" - meaning they are composed of two parts/units.
*   In computer science, the smallest unit of data is a ""bit,"" which can have a value of either 0 or 1. Therefore, ruhkum 0 hte 1 are called bit ni.

The other options don't fit the context:

*   Manu (B): This translates to ""value"" or ""worth,"" which doesn't directly describe the individual units of 0 and 1.
*   Laksan ga (C): This translates to ""special language"" which refers to the binary language as a whole, not the individual 0 and 1.
*   Hkrang ni (D): This means ""form/shape,"" but is not related to the term for binary units."
Jawng ma ni blogging ka ai ten hta madung amyat hku nna npu e jaw da ai kaw na hpa hpe laika hta n tang madun da ai kun?,"The correct answer is **B: Tsang madang bung ai ni shada mara tam hkat ai lam yawm na matu**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Lik tara hte laika ka ai atsam hta rawt jat wa ai lam** - The passage explicitly states that blogging improves students' writing skills and grammar.
*   **C: Makau grup yin hta ningmu jahpaw ai lam jaw ai** - The passage talks about how students analyze and interpret information from various sources, developing their own perspectives.
*   **D: Matut nna hkaja mayu ai myit grau nna tsaw wa na amtu** - The passage suggests blogging is a tool for collaborative learning and continuous learning beyond the classroom.
*   **B: Tsang madang bung ai ni shada mara tam hkat ai lam yawm na matu** - While the passage mentions students being critical readers and striving for accuracy, it doesn't specifically say that blogging reduces fault-finding among peers of the same grade.
"
Npu e jaw da ai blogging ka ai lam hta jawng ma ni a laika ka ladat kung kyang hkun ai dawsang gaw hpa rai ta?,"The correct answer is **C: Shanhte a poi yu masha ni a myit shang sha ai lam hpe mazing da ra ai lam** (Maintaining the interest of their audience).

The passage states, ""Shawa myit shang sha hkra galaw ai lam gaw jawng ma ni hpe grau ram ai, myit shang sha hkra myit sharawt ya ai"" which translates to ""Making it appealing to the public is more important to the students and motivates them."" This directly relates to their writing skills improving as they try to keep their audience engaged.

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Ganghkau ntsa na rai ni hpe jahkring hkring htai ai lam** (Responding quickly to online content): While the passage mentions responding to internet content, it's more about critical analysis and forming opinions, not just quick responses.
*   **B: Mara tam hkat ai lam ni hpe koi gam mayu ai myit** (Desire to avoid criticism): While students strive to write accurately to avoid criticism, this is more of a consequence of blogging, not the primary driver of improvement.
*   **D: Arau galaw na matu ra ai lam** (The need to collaborate): While blogging can be collaborative, the passage emphasizes individual skill development through creating engaging content."
Npu e jaw da ai asynchronous matut mahkai lam hta na jawng ma ni a matu akyu n nga ai gaw hpa baw rai? ,"The correct answer is **B: Shani gara ten hta raitim sara wa hte man hkrum hkrum lu ai** (Meeting the teacher face-to-face at any time of the day).

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes that asynchronous communication allows students to ask questions and receive answers **without** needing to wait for the next in-person meeting. This implies that they *cannot* meet the teacher face-to-face whenever they want.

The other options are benefits of asynchronous communication described in the passage:

*   **A: Internet ganghkau hpe arawng arang hku jai lang ai** (Using the Internet widely): The passage explicitly mentions using the Internet and World Wide Web for learning.
*   **C: Galai shai loi ai bungli galaw ten** (Flexible work schedule): The passage states that asynchronous learning can lead to some flexibility in work schedules.
*   **D: Chyang shadang hpe up hkang lu ai** (Control over learning pace): The passage mentions asynchronous communication gives students control over their learning pace and the steps involved."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai asynchronous matut mahkai lam hta jawng ma ni a matu galai gachyai n loi ai lam gaw hpa rai ta?","The correct answer is **A: Sharin hkam la na lagaw lahkam** (Learning pace).

Here's why:

* The passage states asynchronous communication empowers students to ""work at their own pace"" and ""control the steps related to the information presented."" This directly relates to the *learning pace* or the speed at which they can process information.
* The other options are not as directly linked to the benefits of asynchronous communication discussed in the passage.
"
Ka-ang wundang prat a langchyi ni hte seng na Matsing masat ga yan hta n sang lang dan da ai lam gaw hpa rai ta?,"The answer is **C: Share shagan ni hkan sa ra ai htung tara** (The code of conduct for knights).

Here's why:

* **P** mentions knights, their combats, and even King Arthur, alluding to the concept of chivalry.
* **Q** asks what *isn't* explicitly detailed in the passage.
* Options A, B, and D (Ga hku, Marai lahkawng gumra jawn nna gasat ai, Gumra jawn share shagan) are directly mentioned, while specific codes of conduct (htung tara) for knights are implied but not explicitly listed.

Therefore, C is the correct choice because it represents an aspect of knighthood that is not directly stated.
"
Langchyi hten run ai hta myi gale kau ya ai sama shing nrai nsen ni hpe npu e jaw da ai Matsing masat hta n sang lang dan da ai gaw hpa baw rai?,"Based on the context of the passage, the question ""Langchyi hten run ai hta myi gale kau ya ai sama shing nrai nsen ni hpe npu e jaw da ai Matsing masat hta n sang lang dan da ai gaw hpa baw rai?"" is most closely related to **B: Hkrit ai (Fear)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes the romanticized and often idealized view of medieval castles.
*   The question asks why certain aspects are omitted when discussing castle ruins, suggesting a darker, more realistic side to their history.
*   The choices A, C, and D are aspects of castle life that would likely be presented in a romanticized manner.
*   **Fear** is a powerful emotion that would be present during a siege, attack, or any other form of threat to the castle. However, this emotional reality might be glossed over in favor of a more glorified narrative about knights, feasts, and adventure.

Therefore, the question is asking why the fear associated with a castle's downfall is often not discussed."
Npu e jaw da ai hta na Kirby Muxloe Castle a teng ai hku hpaw hpyan da ai lam gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Gawgap ai ten hta mungdan kata simsa ai shingra tara a majaw ninghkap dap kachyi mi sha ra ai**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that by 1480, there was peace in the country, and castles only needed to defend against small bands of raiders. This aligns with option B, suggesting a smaller defense force was sufficient because of the peace.
*   Option A is incorrect because the passage states Lord Hastings initiated the construction but not the design of the walls.
*   Option C is incorrect because the passage mentions that construction began in 1480, when peace existed, it can be assumed that the timing was suitable.
*   Option D is incorrect. The passage implies that the castle's design was overkill for the actual threats it faced, indicating it was NOT built to withstand long, determined sieges.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate inference based on the information provided in the passage."
Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai lam hta hkan nna Kirby Muxloe langchyi hpe gawgap ten hta npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara wa hpe shawoi na hte maren ngu nna dawdan mai na kun?,"The passage states that Kirby Muxloe Castle was ""more perfect than many real castles"" and that its large moat and brick walls were unlikely to withstand a proper siege. However, the passage also states that it was built during a time of peace when the main threat was small groups of raiders.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **B: Gasat gala lam ni hpe madi shadaw ya lu na matu npawt hkridun gawgap da wa ai**.  While the castle *was* heavily defended, the *reason* for its design was less about large-scale sieges (which it wouldn't withstand) and more about defending against smaller threats.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw nna du wa na ginsup ladaw hta lagat shing jawng ai ni hkyen lajang ai hta gara wa gaw grau nna akyu nga ai kun?","Based on the passage, the best answer is **D: Ntsa hkum hkrang a matu ginsup rung ni de sa nna sa ginsup ai** (Go to gyms and train for the upper body).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that some coaches who specialize in ""nshung ta laman hkrup ai hku lagat ai"" (a specific type of stroke) believe that ""hkum hkrang lahta de na matu ginsup dum hta bai gayau ginsup ai lam"" (going to the gym to train for the upper body) is the ""kaja dik ai mahkyen"" (best approach) for swimming competitions.

The other options are less supported:

*   **A: Ginhtawng ta hta mungdan hpe shing grup nna lagat shaman ai** (Swimming around the country during the dry season): There's nothing in the passage to indicate the training to involve swimming around the country.
*   **B: Shaman ai ten hta chyang shadang hpe maju jung nna shaman ra ai** (Focus on speed during training): The passage explicitly states that endurance is *more* important than speed.
*   **C: Minit masum ram aten jaw ai** (Allowing about three minutes of time): The passage mentions someone doing something in two minutes being fast, but doesn't specify an amount of time to give for practice.
"
"Matsing masat hta tsun da ai hte maren, alat ningshawng-madang mile daw chyen lagat ai wa na matunpu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara mahtang gaw ahkyak dik re ai kun?","The correct answer is **B: Lagat ai chyang shadang hta hkumhkrang hkam lu ai atsam hpe shaman ra ai**.

Here's why:

*   The prompt (P) states: ""Kagat ai lam hpe deng htam mali na htam mi sha re ai kaw na deng chyen mi rai mat ai a majaw, ndai kagat ai lam hta ba lu hkam ai lam gaw chyang shadang hta grau ahkyak mat wa ai."" This directly translates to: ""Because the race is now half a mile instead of a quarter mile, **endurance is more important than speed in this race**."" Endurance is essentially the ability to maintain physical fitness/energy for a prolonged period of time.

Option B is the only one that reflects the emphasis on physical endurance over speed."
"Ginsup ninghkrin matu, npu e jaw da ai hta n-gun rawng ai lusha sha shaman ai lam hte sha n mai byin ai lam gaw hpa rai?","Based on the provided text (P), the correct answer is **D: Hkam kaja lam**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that while lifestyle habits and diet are not the *only* things that lead to physical growth, they *do* contribute significantly to the healthy development of young athletes.
*   It highlights the importance of awareness of health benefits (Hkamja ngun atsam hpe sadi ai), staying hydrated (hkum hkrang kaw hka dat law nga matu sadia ai), and understanding proper techniques (ngut nna tatup galaw ni hpa atsawm sha chye na ai).
*   The implication is that neglecting these health-related aspects would hinder the athlete's overall progress and performance.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Galaw shamu shamawt ai lam ni rawt jat wa ai** - While diet and lifestyle *can* impact physical activity levels, the passage emphasizes *health* aspects more directly in the context of developing young athletes.
*   **B: Myit kabu ai lam rawt jat wa ai** - Although physical health can influence mood, the passage's focus is on the tangible physical benefits.
*   **C: Galaw shamu shamawt ai lam ni ningtawn wa ai** - Similar to option A, while lifestyle may affect physical activity, the passage puts more emphasis on the health aspect."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, asak kaji ai ginsup ninghkrin ni hpe shanhte a ginsup hpan hta myit pyaw lam tam lu na matu npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara wa hpe hpaji n jaw da ai rai?","The passage discusses the benefits of appropriate nutrition, hydration, and body awareness for young athletes. Let's analyze the options based on the passage:

*   **A: Htap htuk ai lusha sha shaman ai (Appropriate nutrition):** The passage mentions the importance of ""Htap htuk malu masha shaman shakyang ai lam ni,"" which translates to appropriate nutrition. So, this IS mentioned.
*   **B: Ningtawn ai madang hta dingyang matut galaw shakut ai (Consistently working at a competitive level):** The passage doesn't mention competitive levels or the necessity to be highly competitive as a primary factor in enjoying sports. It focuses on healthy habits and body awareness.
*   **C: Hka dat hpe jahpring ya ai (Staying hydrated):** The passage mentions ""hkum hkrang kaw hka dat law nga matu sadia ai,"" emphasizing the importance of staying hydrated. So, this IS mentioned.
*   **D: Hkam kaja ai n-gun atsam hpe shadaw ya ai (Maintaining good physical health):** The passage mentions ""Hkamja ngun atsam hpe sadi ai,"" which translates to being mindful of physical health. So, this IS mentioned.

Therefore, the answer is **B: Ningtawn ai madang hta dingyang matut galaw shakut ai (Consistently working at a competitive level)** because the text does not provide advice on being competitive to encourage enjoyment."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpa majaw ka-ang sumsan ginsup ninghkrin wa gaw grai hpu ai arai ni hpe mari na kun?","Based on the provided text:

* **P** states that there are misconceptions about expensive tools in the context of independent craftsmanship. It mentions that while tools can be customized, most are small and don't significantly improve the craft. Independent craftspeople may prefer tools even if they can't afford the best, suggesting a priority beyond pure functionality.

* **Q** asks why an independent craftsperson would buy expensive items according to a certain quote.

Given this, the most logical answer is **B: Dai gaw akyu rawng ai lam hpe sakse madun ya ai** (That demonstrates value).

Here's why:

* The passage in P implies that expensive tools may represent something beyond just their immediate utility.  Craftspeople may buy them to showcase or express a value they associate with the craft, like quality, dedication, or aesthetics.

The other options are less fitting:

* **A: Dai gaw shanhte dinghkrai a ra sharawng lam hte seng ai** (That is related to their personal desires) This is too broad. The passage implies there's more to it than just individual whims.
* **C: Dai gaw shanhte a shamu shamawt lam hta akyu kaba nga ai** (That is very helpful in their activities) The passage argues *against* expensive tools being that helpful in practice.
* **D: Manu hpa ai rai ni hte seng nna mung ningmu shut taw ai lam ni nga ai** (There are also misunderstandings regarding valuable items) While the passage touches on misunderstandings, this isn't the direct reason *why* they buy the expensive items.

Therefore, **B** best captures the nuanced reasoning behind why an independent craftsperson might purchase expensive items, even if their practical benefit is limited: to demonstrate a value.

Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren ka-ang sumtsan lagat ai hta hpa baw ra na kun?,"Based on the provided passage, the answer is **C: kaji kajaw rai**.

Nuclear hpri sharaw dat kadu nsen hpe kadai mu tam da ai kun? ,"The text states: ""MRI gaw Felix Bloch (Stanford Dakkasu hta magam gun) hte Edward Purcell (Harvard Dakkasu hta magam gun) kaw nna shaning 1930 hkan mu sawk la nna, nukalia (nuclear) hpri sharaw nsen atsam (NMR) ngut tsun ai hkrang jasat byin yan hta mahta ai re.""

This clearly indicates that Felix Bloch and Edward Purcell discovered the nuclear magnetic resonance phenomenon.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Bloch hte Purcell**.
"
Tsi mawan hte seng ai kadu nsen a matu shawng nna na hkrang madu ahkaw ahkang hpe gara shaning hta jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**

The passage states: ""Mali ning na mat ai hpang, hkrang madu ahkaw ahkang langai myi hpe jaw lai wa sai. "" Which translates to ""Four years later, he was granted a patent."" Since Dr. Damadian discovered the use of NMR for medical diagnosis in 1970, four years after that would be 1974.

"Matsing masat ga hta tsun da ai hte maren, kaga masha ni a hkrang hte seng ai lachyum hpyan na matu shinggyim masha ni gaw gara hpe ngang kang ai hku nna chye da ra na kun?","The correct answer is **B: Yaw shada lam (Intentions)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes understanding *how* people reason, their *intentions*, beliefs, knowledge, and desires.**  The example given is about correctly interpreting someone's actions with a car. If their *intention* is to steal the car, that's different than if their *intention* is simply to open their own car. This is about what a person aims to achieve.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Myit ra lam (Desires):** While desires are part of understanding others, the passage focuses on the broader process of reasoning about their actions, and the critical example centers on determining the *intent* behind those actions.
*   **C: Makam (Beliefs):** Beliefs are also important but secondary to intention in this context.
*   **D: Ningmu (Perspectives):** While related to empathy, perspectives don't directly address the core need to understand *why* someone is doing something.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, yaw shada lam hpe chye na ai gaw shinggyim masha ni hpa galaw na matu karum ya ai kun?","The correct answer is **A: Hkrang hte seng ai lam ni hta n jaw n teng ai lam ni hpe koi gam na matu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explains that understanding others' intentions (yaw shada lam) helps us interpret their actions correctly. In the example, knowing whether someone is trying to steal a car or simply unlock their own car dramatically changes our judgment of the situation. This directly relates to avoiding false accusations (n jaw n teng ai lam ni) based on appearances (hkrang hte seng ai lam ni).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Myit ra lam hpe tak yu na matu:** While understanding intentions can indirectly help with understanding desires, the passage's main focus is on interpreting actions and avoiding misjudgments, not specifically on determining needs.
*   **C: Kaga shinggyim masha ni hpe dawdan lam n galaw ai sha mu na matu:** Understanding intentions helps us make *informed* judgments, not avoid them entirely. The point is to make *accurate* judgments, not to suspend judgment altogether.
*   **D: Kaga masha ni a myit hpe hti na matu:** The passage mentions ""myit ni hpe hti sumru ai lam,"" but it also emphasizes that this involves understanding their motivations and perspectives to interpret their actions correctly. The focus is not on directly reading minds but on using contextual clues and empathy to understand why someone is acting in a certain way."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai hta na AI a madung yaw shada lam ginchyum gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **D: Bungli hpe shi hkrai galaw ai** (Doing work by itself).

The passage explicitly states that AI's research aims to create machines that can work autonomously.  ""AI a sawk tam hpaji hta zai arawn alai shi hkrai shi rawng nna bungli chye galaw wa ai jak hpe lu shaprawt ai lam lawm ai."" This translates to ""AI research involves creating machines that are intelligent and capable of doing work on their own.""
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e madun da ai hta AI hte matut mahkai lam nga ai gaw hpa rai?","Based on the text, the answer is **B: Lamang galaw ai hte lamang hparan ai (Lamang galaw ai hte lamang hparan ai)**.

Here's why:

*   The text mentions ""masing jahkrat ai lam"" which translates to ""planning"" or ""programming"".
*   The text also says AI can ""hparan mai ai computa hpungtang hpaji"" meaning AI is used to ""solve computational problems"".

Therefore, **B** directly reflects the AI applications described in the passage. Other options are mentioned but not in direct relation to AI."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw nna shara mi kaw sha chye myit ai masha a n-gun gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **D: Myit dum ai (Remembering)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes that this type of thinking believes ""dai hta e mahtai jaw ai langai sha nga ai"" (there is only one correct answer). It also says ""dai masha ni gaw chye myit dum ai"" (these people know and remember). This directly links to the power of remembering the correct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Manghkang langai a matu jaw ai mahtai grai law shapraw ya ai (Produces many correct answers for a problem):** This contradicts the passage's statement that there's only one correct answer.
*   **B: Manghkang langai hta ladat nnan ni jai lang ya ai (Uses new methods in a problem):** This type of thinking relies on established knowledge and logic, not necessarily new methods.
*   **C: Manghkang ni hpe hparan lu na matu shanhte a aten la nna galaw ai (They take their time to solve problems):** While this might be true sometimes, the passage doesn't specifically highlight this as a key strength. The emphasis is on knowing the correct answer and using established knowledge."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw shara mi kaw sha chye myit ai myit ningmu a madung ngu n mai myit la ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Masha langai a aten la ai**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Dai hta jaw ai mahtai langai sha nga ai ngu ai hpe chye na ai** - This directly reflects a core principle of the described mindset: believing there is one right answer.
*   **C: Lawnglam ni hpe madi shadaw ai** - This aligns with the text's mention of supporting ""principles, accuracy, guidelines.""
*   **D: Shiga ni hpe mahkawng ai** - Gathering information is mentioned as part of this analytical approach.

The passage does *not* suggest that ""taking one's time"" is a defining principle of this type of thinking. The focus is on logic, accuracy, and finding the correct solution, which might sometimes require time but is not a fundamental principle itself."

Npu e jaw da ai laika kaw nna myi hte nmu lu ai myi man nsam lachyum hta ai seng nna n jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Dai gaw myit malang ai lam hpe dawdan ya ai.**

Here's why:

*   **A: Video nsen rim ai lam ni gaw mu mada ai hku nna rawt jat wa ai** - This aligns with the passage, which states video analysis captures subtle facial expressions.
*   **B: Jaw ai hku lachyum hta ai gaw masu magaw lam hpe chye hkun ai** - The passage mentions that analyzing subtle expressions could potentially detect deception.
*   **C: Ga shaga ai hte myi man nsam ni hta mung lachyum hta la mai ai** - The passage discusses both facial expressions and Oliver Sacks's point about understanding communication beyond the words themselves (interpreting the full message).
*   **D: Dai gaw myit malang ai lam hpe dawdan ya ai** - The passage does not say that facial expression helps decide if someone is smart. It focuses on *comprehension* and understanding meaning, not intelligence.

Therefore, option D is the statement that is NOT supported by the text."
Npu e jaw da ai hta na Renaissance ngu ai Greek hpaji myit sawn ai lam a mahtai hku nna grau ahkyak wa ai kun? ,"The passage states that the Renaissance, rooted in Greek philosophy, brought about a significant shift toward ""hpaji byeng nya hpe chyam bra hkra garan kachyan ai lam"" - distributing and spreading knowledge. This directly relates to option B.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: machye machyang shabra shachyam ai lam** (spreading and distributing knowledge).
"
"Renaissance ngu ai Greek hpaji myit sawn ai lam a majaw, npu e jaw da ai hta na gara wa gaw maju jung ai lam yawm ai kun?","Based on the provided text (P), here's the breakdown of why the answer is likely C:

*   **P emphasizes contrasts:** The passage highlights differences in how information is received.
*   **Direct callbacks are negative:** ""bai shaga ai hta dai kaw nga ai ni hpe myit npyaw hpa nga ai"" - Direct callbacks (A) are seen negatively.
*   **Written callbacks are positive:** ""dai shaga ai laika gaw yang myit shang sha ai rai wa ai"" - Written callbacks (C) are viewed positively.
*   **Renaissance focuses on widespread knowledge:** The passage mentions that the Renaissance and Greek philosophy caused a ""kaba ai dandawng ai galai shai ai lam hpe galaw ya wa sai"" in terms of spreading knowledge.

The question (Q) asks about something LESS aligned with the Renaissance's goal of broad knowledge. Therefore:

*   A direct call back may not do much damage, but could cause disruption and it does not work to spread information.
*   A news story would be good for spreading information.
*   A written call back may not do much damage, and may even provide some good info.
*   Information spreading is the main goal of the Renaissance, so this is not the answer.

**Therefore, the answer is (C) Laika hku bai shaga ai (Written callback).**

**Explanation**

The point of question P is to say that spreading information and sharing knowledge is the ultimate goal. While things such as direct callbacks may cause problems, the main goal is still to ensure that the information spreads properly."
Matut manoi ganawn mazum na matu internet hpe jai lang na myit sharawt ya ai lam hku nna lawu kaw gara hpe nlu sawn ai rai?,"The passage mentions ""hkaja ai lam"" (information searching) and ""kanawn mazum ai lam"" (social interaction) as motivations for using the internet. Eighmey and McCord found that ""dinghkrai shang lawm ai lam"" (entertainment) and ""matut manoi ganawn mazum ai lam ni"" (interactive communication) were new motivational factors for returning to websites.

The question asks which of the options is *not* likely a motivation for using the internet for interactive communication. Let's analyze the options:

*   **B: Nta masha ni hte galoi mung matut mahkai lam nga ai (Staying in touch with family):** This is clearly related to interactive communication.
*   **D: Masha nnan ni hte hkrum zup ai (Meeting new people):** This is also clearly related to interactive communication.
*   **C: Bu hkawm ai lam ni hpe sawk tam ai (Researching travel):** While related to information searching, it doesn't directly contribute to interactive communication.

*   **A: Sut masa hte seng ai hkridun (Financial transaction):** While it can involve communication, it's not primarily interactive.

Therefore, the best answer is either A or C.  Since the passage focuses on motivations related to communication and interaction, the option that is *least* related to that is **A: Sut masa hte seng ai hkridun (Financial transaction)**. While there *can* be communication during a financial transaction, it's not the primary purpose or a motivator for using the internet *for communication*.

**So the answer is A.**
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara gaw dinghkrai shang lawm ai a matu internet jai ai lam hte seng nna myit sharawt ai lam n re ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Gumhpraw ni hpe hparan ai**.

Here's why:

*   The passage highlights ""Dinghkrai shang lawm ai lam"" (personal involvement) as a motivator for internet use.
*   Options A, B, and C all reflect active participation and searching for specific information related to personal interests or needs (cooking, online discussions, health-related information). This aligns with the idea of personal involvement.
*   Option D, ""Gumhpraw ni hpe hparan ai"" (managing finances), while important, doesn't necessarily fall under the category of ""dinghkrai shang lawm ai lam"" as described in the context of the passage. It's more related to practical needs or financial management, not necessarily personal interests or engagement."
Sinna Uropa gaw shingkang shingna hta shamyen shanat ai lam hpe jahkring kau nna tinang hkrang hte galoi kaw nna hpang wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka-ang prat a jahtum laman**.

The passage states that ""Ka-ang prat htum wa ai shaloi, sinna maga na uropa masha ni gaw shanhte na shanhte lai shingni ni hpe gaw sharawt hpang lai wa sai re.""  This translates to ""As the Middle Ages ended, Western Europeans began to emphasize their own styles."" Therefore, the shift away from imitation and towards original styles occurred at the end of the Middle Ages.
"
Hkindang ni hpe lang nna bu hpun ni hpe gyit shajup ai gaw hpa baw na mahtai rai? ,"The correct answer is **C: Makam masham majan ten**.

"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw nna shingra tara hte seng ai mayak ni a matu gara hpe longterm mahtai ngu nna mai sawn la ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Manghkang byin hkun ai lam ni hpe sawk tam ai** (Looking for the root causes of problems).

Here's why:

*   **The passage emphasizes addressing the root cause:** The passage directly states, ""lama na anhte gaw jahkring jahkra mahtai hpe sha ra ai nre yang gaw, anhte ni gaw ana a ru npawt hpe shawng tam ra na re. Dai hpang she shanhte hpe mai jahkring shamit kau mai na re."" This translates to: ""if we don't only want a temporary answer, we need to first find the root of the problem. Only then can we stop it.""
*   **Other options are short-term solutions:** The passage frames options A, B, and D (fighting over-consumption, activists, engaging in environmental movements) as being similar to treating the symptoms of an illness. While helpful in the short term, they do not solve the underlying cause."
"Matsing masat gayan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu ai tsun da ai mahtai ni kaw nna gara wa hpe gaw shingra tara hte seng ai manghkang ni a makawp maga lamngu n sawn la ai rai?","The passage discusses two approaches to dealing with environmental problems:

1.  **Treating the symptoms:** This involves things like participating in environmental cleanups and reducing individual carbon footprints. The passage equates this to treating the symptoms of a disease.  It mentions, ""Anhte gaw makau grup yin hte atsawm hku hkau ai hku na sak hkrung mai ai, anhte gaw makau grup yin shamu shamawt lama hta shang lawm mai ai, ngut na anhte gaw du wa na ten hta hkrum sha wa na kahtet shadang ni shayawm lu na matu myit rawt shanglawm ai ni mung mai galaw ai."" which translates to ""We can live in harmony with the environment, we can participate in environmental cleanups, and we can also become activists to reduce the impacts we will face in the future.""  Option A, ""Myit rawt let shanglawm ai"" (Participating actively), falls into this category.
2.  **Addressing the root causes:** This involves recognizing that overpopulation, unsustainable consumption, and unchecked technological advancement are the underlying problems.  The passage emphasizes that to *really* solve the problem, you need to address these underlying causes: ""...lama na anhte gaw jahkring jahkra mahtai hpe sha ra ai nre yang gaw, anhte ni gaw ana a ru npawt hpe shawng tam ra na re. Dai hpang she shanhte hpe mai jahkring shamit kau mai na re""  (...if we don't just want temporary solutions, we must first find the root cause of the problem. Then we can eliminate them.) Options B, C, and D align more closely with addressing those root causes:
    *   **B: Manghkang ni a ru npawt hpe pat kau ai** (Eliminating the root causes of the problems) - This is a direct statement of addressing the core issues.
    *   **C: Ladu lai jai ai nga sat nga sa lam hte seng ai ningmu ni htawng madun wa ai** (Exposing perspectives related to wasteful consumption patterns) - This addresses the issue of unsustainable consumption.
    *   **D: Shingra tara hte grau hku hkau ai lam hku nga ai** (Living in a way that is more harmonious with nature) - This suggests a move away from the unsustainable practices that are causing the environmental issues.

The question asks which of the options is *least* likely to be considered a protection measure for environmental problems. *Myit rawt let shanglawm ai* which translates to *""participating actively""* is the action that least solves the true root cause of the problem.

Therefore, the answer is **A**.
"
Nawku hpung hte seng ai hta ana hte grau seng ai ngu ai madung mayak kata Uropa hta gara mungdan gaw shawng nnan majan byin hkrum ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Spain**.

The passage states: ""Spain a Majan dang hkring htawng dagraw ai lam gaw shawng nna majan hta gin jaw a masing re ai ahkang aya shingdaw shangang ai lam hpe masat da sai."" This translates to ""The Spanish succession crisis first established the principle of balance of power as a war aim."" This directly implies Spain was involved in an early war related to the balance of power in Europe.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Sumshi ning na ai Majan** (Thirty Years' War)

Npu e jaw da ai hta Cahtolic Nawku jawng a gara ningmu hpe n jep da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Nawku jawng kata ngun atsam pawng hpawn shang lawm lam** (Involvement of powerful individuals within the church).

Here's why:

*   The passage primarily discusses the Catholic Church's wealth, how it was acquired, and whether it aligns with the Christian principle of helping the poor. It questions the motivations behind building grand structures and accumulating wealth.
*   Options A, B, and D all relate to the Church's financial practices and adherence to its principles. These are subjects of scrutiny in the passage.
*   Option C is a more general concept. While the passage mentions the influence of people from kings to commoners, it doesn't specifically focus on the *internal power dynamics* and participation of influential individuals within the Church as the primary object of the inquiry. The text focuses on questioning the integrity of spending.

Therefore, the passage is *not* primarily examining the participation of powerful individuals within the church."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Versailles hta kadai sat kau hkrum ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Sin langa**.

The passage states: ""Masha nmat hpung kaw na langai wa gaw, Versailles na hkawhkam jan shawng kaw hkawhkam wang sin langa hpe langai hpe sat kau ai."" This translates to ""One person from the crowd killed a royal guard in front of the Queen in Versailles.""

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the crowd *wanted* to break the axles of the carriage. It doesn't say they succeeded in opening the carriage door.
*   The other options are things that definitely happened based on the provided passage:
    *   B: They were forced to leave Versailles.
    *   C: A guard was killed.
    *   D: They were forced to return to Paris."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara gaw yu maya nre ai Britain hka hpyen majan baw ai lam a mahtai nre ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Mungkan hte seng ai tara hta hkan nna galai shai ai lam ni galaw ma ai.**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states the blockade ""tawt lai ai raitim, ndai zai ladat gaw masan sa ai lam nga ai..."" which translates to ""even though it violated international law, this tactic was considered advanced..."" This directly contradicts option C, which implies adherence to international law.
*   The other options are more in line with what the passage says. A states the German reaction, B details a side effect of the blockades, and D addresses the halting of essential supplies."
Germany ni hpe ninghkap nna wang da ai Britain ni a hka hpyen dap hpe gara ndau laika gaw n teng ai hku hpaw tsun dan da ai kun?,"The passage states that the British blockade, while considered a violation of international law, ""succeeds in demonstrating the value of cutting off vital military and civilian supplies.""

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Dai gaw mungkan hte seng ai tara hpe ninghkap wa ai (That it violated international law):** The passage directly states that the blockade was considered a violation of international law. This is true and does *not* misrepresent anything.
*   **B: Dai gaw Germany hka shang sanghpaw ni hpe karum ningtum jaw ai (That it aided German submarines):** The passage states the *opposite*. The blockade was intended to *prevent* supplies from reaching Germany, including supplies that submarines would need.
*   **C: Dai gaw German karum ningtum hpung ni hpe kadawn kau hkun ai (That it cut off German relief efforts):** While the blockade cut off civilian supplies, it did so for the entire country. This statement implies it targeted relief efforts specifically, which isn't accurate.
*   **D: Dai gaw yu yu sanghpaw ni gaw dingbai dingna n jaw ai hpe shateng ya ai (That it prevented neutral ships from being harmed):** The passage mentions that even neutral ships were affected (""Britain has the power to intercept any ship on the high seas, *even neutral ones*""). So, the blockade *didn't* prevent harm to neutral ships.

Therefore, the answer is **B**. The passage clearly states that the blockade aimed to *stop* supplies from reaching Germany (including supplies needed by submarines), while option B claims it *aided* German submarines, making it the untrue statement."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, Multiple Sclerosis ana gaw kadai ni kaw grau nna mai byin ai rai?","The passage states that women are twice as likely to get MS as men. Therefore, to be the *most* likely, we need a woman. The passage also says it's a leading cause of neurological issues in young to middle-aged people.  The older the candidate is, the less likely they are to contract the disease (when compared to a younger candidate).

Thus, the best answer is **A: Asak 32 ning re ai num** (a 32-year-old woman).
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, shamu shamawt lam hta ayan shang lawm ai ni gaw hpa na matu madi shadaw lam grau ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Machyi hkam sha ai ntsa e n kaja ai myit ningmu**

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""...dai ayan galaw ai lamang ni hpe shang lawm ai lam hpe machyi taw ai ana hte shamu shamawt nmai ai a majaw machyi taw ai lam hpe garan ginghka ai shaloi na machyi ai a ntsa e rawng ai nkaja ai myit a matu madi shadaw ai lam grau ra ahkyak nga ai.""
*   **Translation:** ""...support for the negative feelings associated with pain when separating the experiences of engaging in activities from the disease itself is particularly important.""
*   **In simpler terms:** The passage emphasizes that frequent participants in activities need more support to deal with the negative emotions related to their pain when they distinguish between engaging in the activity and the underlying illness.

Therefore, option A directly addresses the ""nkaja ai myit"" (negative feelings/emotions) related to ""machyi ai"" (pain/illness) as mentioned in the passage."
"Matsing masat gayan hta mahta nna, zauhkyen hpe gara hku ginsup ai rai?","The question asks how Zauhkyen is categorized based on records, according to the given passage. The passage mentions that Zauhkyen spans from university studies to the Olympics.

Therefore, the best answer is:

*   **A: Prat dep hpan hku nna**

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Dakkasu jawng madang** - While mentioned, it's not the encompassing way Zauhkyen is categorized.
*   **C: Olympic ginsup ai madang** - Similarly, only one level mentioned in the context of how Zauhkyen is categorized.
*   **D: Marai lahkawng ginsup ai hkrang** - This describes the *nature* of the competition (one-on-one) not how it's categorized by level or type.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta hkan nna, npu e jaw da ai hta na gara gaw hkum kata kaw gung byin ai mabyin a n-gun ja dik ai madi madun re ai rai?","The passage states:

This directly corresponds to option D:

*   **D: Tsi bu a mastun** (Medicine instructions).

Therefore, the strongest indicator of an internal issue is **D: Tsi bu a mastun**."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta hkan nna, tsim yam hkrum ai masha hpe dawdan ai hta shawng nnan galaw ra ai htap htuk ai lahkam gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **A: Mabyin shara hta sawk tam ai** (Examining the location).

The passage clearly states that *before* you approach someone affected by a disaster to help them, you need to assess the *situation* (mabyin hpe shawng jep mada yu ra na re) to ensure your own safety.  This assessment of the situation is equivalent to examining the location. The other options are actions that would come *after* ensuring the scene is safe.
"
Npu e jaw da ai hta na gara gaw tsim yam hkrum ai masha wa hpe san jep ai hpe tup hkrak n lu tsun dan ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Tsim yam hkrum ai masha hta shawng mabyin byin ai shara de shawng shang u** (Rush into the place where the disaster happened first for the victim).

Here's why:

* **P states:** You need to first assess the situation to ensure your own safety before approaching a disaster victim. Going directly into the disaster site without assessing it first contradicts this principle. It emphasizes assessing the scene first. The passage explains that you need to check the situation first to ensure your safety before checking the disaster victim. You need to pay attention to the scene and the victim's possible signs of trauma. If you get injured while trying to help, you will only exacerbate the problem.
* **A: Nang hta lu ai nma hpe hkam jan lu na matu hkum tsang** (Be careful to overcome any injuries you have) - This is not relevant to the passage.
* **C: Tsim yam hkrum ai masha a arawng aya hpe sawk sagawn u** (Investigate the dignity of the disaster victim) - This is not a consideration mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Dawnghkawn ahkyeng ni hpe sadi maja ra ai** (Be aware of early warning signs) - The passage states that you must observe the victim's surroundings and signs of trauma. This aligns with the passage.

Therefore, the passage directly advises against rushing into the disaster site without first assessing the situation.

Here's why:

*   **P states:** *""... amyu sha myit jasat hte mungdan gaw mung mash ni hte seng ai re nna uphkang ai marai langai hte sha seng ai nre ngu nna kam ai lam de galai shai wa ai...""* This directly reflects the rise of nationalism, the idea that the nation belongs to its people, not just a ruler.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Madang shingjawng ai lam de galai mat ai (Change to a competitive level):** While the French Revolution did change social hierarchies to some degree, this answer is far too vague and not the main point.
*   **C: Gumsan magam masa hpe hkap la ai (Acceptance of the constitutional monarchy):** The French Revolution, initially, was not entirely against monarchy, but eventually, the revolution aimed for a republic where power was held by the people. Option A, The Rise of Nationalism, is a far better answer, as nationalism is a very widespread effect of the French Revolution.
*   **D: Shadawn sharam nnan ladat (New Exemplary Method):** This is too vague and does not relate to the text.
* Option D is vague and does not directly relate to the text."
"French gumlang ai lam ngut ai hpang,hpyen dap hte kaga bungli ni hta awngdang ai gaw hpa hta npawt gaw da ai lam mahkoi yawm dik rai?","The passage states that ""Some joined the army to follow their caliber and achieve rank in the camp where they were stationed,"" and also that after the revolution, many people were inspired to join the military not for rank or position, but because of their shared beliefs and the collective good. The question asks what success in the military and other jobs was *least* based on after the French Revolution.

*   **A: Awngdang lam (Success):** This is very general and doesn't pinpoint a specific factor that became less important.
*   **B: Tsang (Rank/Class):** The passage specifically mentions that people joined the military NOT to achieve rank based on their social class.
*   **C: Yaw shada lam (Goal):** The passage refers to the shift from seeking personal gain to serving a common goal or nation.
*   **D: Caliber:** The passage states that some people used their *caliber* to gain rank, but others didn't because they were inspired by a cause.

Based on the provided information and question, and understanding what the question is asking, the answer is **B: Tsang (Rank/Class)**. It directly contradicts the spirit of the passage, which speaks to a shift *away* from a system where social rank dictates success.
"
Rawt jat taw sai mungdan ni hta law malawng myit n dik hkun ai gaw gara shawa karum ningtum jaw ai lam kaw na byin ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Shawa htaw wa htaw sa lam**.

The passage discusses problems and frustrations associated with public transportation (shawa htaw wa htaw sa lam). The question asks what often causes dissatisfaction in developing countries, and the passage directly links public transportation to negative experiences.
"
"Matsing masat laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, shawa htaw wa htaw sa lam ladat hte seng nna hpa mai tsun ai rai?","Based on the information in the prompt (P) and the question (Q), the best answer is:

**C: Dai hpe jawn yu ai masha ni mung dai hpe mara tam shawk shawn ai lam ni mung byin nga ai**

Here's why:

*   **Prompt (P):** Mentions that many people use transportation, and in developed countries, you often encounter conflict due to inequality related to transport. It directly asks why transport systems cause accusations and why they fall short of daily needs. This implies criticism and dissatisfaction.
*   **Option C:** Directly states that people who use public transportation experience both using it and finding fault with it. This aligns directly with the problems and questions raised in the prompt.

Let's examine why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Dai ni hpe jawn yu ai ni masha yawng gaw dai ni hpe ra ma ai** This is a strong statement that doesn't really address all the concerns of the prompt, as the prompt questions the quality.
*   **B: Dai ni gaw hka madang zawn gaw n kaja hkra gaw n re** Is incorrect, as it means that the people who use the transportation never like it.
*   **D: Rawt jat ai mungdan ni hta gaw dai ni hpe shabrai n jaw ra ai** This is not mentioned in the prompt.

Therefore, option C is the most appropriate answer."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, masam maram n mai ai mawdaw gau ai ni a majaw npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara gaw shadawn yu na matu yak ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Mawdaw hting let ai lam**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gam n kaja ai gaw, mawdaw hkang ai ni a sat lawat hpe tsan lam shadang latsa tai nlu maram ai majaw mawdaw htinglet ai lam hpe sharin la ai lam gaw yak ai re."" This directly translates to: ""On the negative side, because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted over long distances, learning autonomous driving is difficult.""

Therefore, autonomous driving (Mawdaw hting let ai lam) is hard to predict/model due to the unpredictable nature of human drivers.
"
Sawn hpan hpaji hku nna mawdaw hting let ai lam ni hpe tang madun ai shaloinpu e jaw da ai kaw na gara hpe akyu nga hkra mai lang na kun?,"The correct answer is **D: Mawdaw hting let ai lam a hkak ai lam**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that successful autonomous driving depends on three key communication attributes: ""hkak ai lam"" (2). This directly relates to how difficult or complex autonomous driving is. The passage argues that because autonomous driving is feasible within fixed parameters, it can be developed using AI. Therefore, understanding the challenges (""hkak ai lam"") of autonomous driving is crucial for using AI to implement it.
"
Hershey hte Chase gaw shanhte a DNA hpe hkum kata de bang na matuhpa hpe jai lang wa ai rai? ,"The correct answer is **D: Viruses**.

The question asks what Hershey and Chase used to inject their DNA. The passage states that ""Hershey hte Chase gaw phage, dai nrai viruses, ni hpe shanhte DNA bacterium kata de bang ai hta lang ma ai."" which translates to ""Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their DNA into bacteria.""
"
Kashu kasha matu mara galai shai ya lu ai lam gaw gara ntsa kaw shamyet shanat nga ai kun?,"The correct answer is **A: Cell ni gaw ginsai hte seng ai rai yang**.

Here's why:

* **P talks about hereditary changes:** It mentions changes (galai shai ai lam) related to genes (ginsai) and how those changes can be passed down (ginlen ya mai re).  It also describes changes that can lead to disease or even death (shantum si ai lam mawng ana byin shangun chye ai).

* **Q asks where hereditary changes are located:** The question directly asks about ""kashu kasha matu mara galai shai ya lu ai lam,"" which translates to ""changes that can be passed down to offspring.""

* **A is the only answer that addresses genes and cells:** Cells are the fundamental unit of life, and genes reside within them. So, the changes passed down hereditarily are located within the genetic material of cells.

The other options are less relevant to the direct question:

* **B:** Focuses on the specific meaning of genetic material, not the location of the heritable changes.
* **C:** Simply states ""variations,"" which is too general.
* **D:** Discusses cells resistant to medicine, which is a different concept.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta jaw da ai lam ni hta madung dat nna, amyu ru sai galai shai ai lam amyu myu hta akyu nga ai lam gaw gara ntsa hta machyu ai lam n’nga ai kun?","The best answer is **A: Ginsai ni hte seng ai arung arai gaw kade ram akyu jaw ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **P's core argument:**  Galai shai (variations/mutations) in genes (ginsai) can have both beneficial and detrimental effects. The beneficial effects are tied to how those gene variations provide advantages. The harmful effects can cause disease or, in the case of germline mutations (ginsai hte seng ai shantum kata galai shai ai lam), be passed down to offspring.

* **Q's Question:**  The question focuses on *where* the advantage of different types of genetic variations is dependent.  In other words, what does the benefit of a genetic variation *depend on*?

* **Why A is the best fit:** The degree to which genetic material is beneficial is dependent on how much that material helps to promote survivial and reproduction.
* **Why the other options are less appropriate:**
    * **B: Lama na akyu jaw ai cell ni gaw ginsai ni hte seng ai rai yang:** While the passage mentions cells related to genes, this option doesn't directly answer where the advantage comes from.
    * **C: Akyu jaw ai ginsai ni hte seng ai arung arai ni a ahkyak ai lam:**  This is too general. It focuses on the *importance* of advantageous genetic material, not on *what it depends on*.
    * **D: Akyu jaw ai galai shai lam a baw hpan:**  This refers to the *type* of beneficial variation, but not what causes the variation to be beneficial or where the advantage is dependent upon.

Therefore, **A** most accurately captures the core issue raised by the prompt and best answers the follow up question.
"

Here's why:

*   The passage states that sheep were domesticated and controlled for products like milk, wool, meat, and leather.
*   Options A, B, and D directly relate to these purposes - providing sustenance, helping with grazing, and providing milk.
*   Option C suggests a relationship of friendship, which isn't mentioned as a primary reason for controlling sheep in ancient cultures according to the passage."
Gawp gayet ai a pandung gaw hpa hpe kachyi sha la na matu rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Bawlung ni**.

The passage states that the players must hit the ball (bawlung) into the hole (hku).
"
"Gawp sharin hpawng hta, tsing hpe gara kaw grau kadun hkra dan da ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Atsit nga ai hta**.

Here's why:

The text says: ""...dai tsingdu pa ni hpe kadun dun re tsing shawt ai hte dai hpe atsit ngu tsun ai."" This translates to ""...the cut short grass around the holes is called Atsit.""

The question asks where the grass is cut short in the training. The answer is at the ""Atsit"".

Therefore, the answer is B.
"
Jep ai lam a madung yaw shada lam gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **A: langai (sh) langai hta grau byin mai ai mai byin ai maram malu ni hpe la kau na matu** (to eliminate impossible hypotheses).

The passage explicitly states that ""Jep jen ai lam hte Jep jen ai lam gaw langai langai hta jan ai mai byin ai maram malu ni hpe la kau na matu"" (Testing and experimentation are for removing impossible hypotheses that are superior to each other.)
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpa gaw hpungtang hpaji hte seng ai sawk tam lam ni hpe lam n madun karum ai rai?","Based on the provided text:

*   **P** states that scientific methods guide scientific inquiry, including filtering out implausible hypotheses and experimenting.

From the given options, the one that *does not* directly help guide scientific inquiry according to the text is:

*   **A: Hpung tang hapji hte seng ai ladat hkrai** which translates to ""Only scientific methods"". While the text says scientific methods are important, it's the specific actions *within* those methods that guide inquiry. Just stating ""use scientific methods"" isn't a specific guiding principle.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A**.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara ndau laika gaw bunghpoi laru hte seng na n jaw ai rai?","The incorrect statement about tornadoes based on the provided text is:

*   **A: Bunghpoi laru gaw shanhte a makau e nga ai arai yawng hpe jahten na ya lu ai**

**Explanation:**
The passage states that tornadoes can destroy everything in their path.

The other options are correct according to the text:

*   **B: Bunghpoi laru gaw kaga nbung laru ni hta na grau kaji ai shara ni hpe jahten ai** - The passage says that tornadoes affect a smaller area compared to other storms.
*   **C: Bunghpoi laru gaw aten hkying hkum masum hta jan nna na ai** - The passage states that some tornadoes have a path length of over three kilometers.
*   **D: Nkau bunghpoi laru ni gaw hkying hkum mi hta mile 300 daram bung ai** - The passage mentions wind speeds reaching 300 mph in some tornadoes."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, bunghpoi laru hte seng ai lam hpe npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara ndau laika gaw jaw ai hku lachyum hpyan da ai rai?","The best answer is **C: shanhte gaw kaga nbung laru ni hta na grau kaba ai shara hpe hkra machyi hkun ai**. Here's why:

*   **The passage focuses on the destructive power of tornadoes despite their small size.** It highlights that tornadoes, despite affecting a small area compared to other storms, can cause significant damage to anything in their path. This supports the idea that they disproportionately impact the area they affect.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Shanhte gaw hkying hkum masum hta jan nna na ai** This is a direct quote from the passage regarding the *diameter* of a tornado, not its overall impact or a comparative statement with other storms.
*   **B: shanhte gaw hkying hkum mi hta mile 480 ram nbung bung ai** While this is accurate regarding wind speed, it doesn't capture the *comparative* aspect of the tornado's destructive power compared to other types of storms, which is the main point of the passage.
*   **D: Shanhte gaw hpun ni hpe ru kaw nna baw kau hkun lu ai** The passage says that bunghpoi laru ni gaw hpun ni hpe baw kau ai, this is accurate but option C is a broader and therefore better summary of the information in the passage."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw nna tsaban 16 hta masha ni gaw hpa ni hpe galaw hpang wa sai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Tsan ai de mai yu ai myiset pe galaw ai** (Making telescopes).

The passage states that telescopes were developed in Europe in the 16th century.
"
Masha ni gaw pat nhpai ni hpe lang nna arai ni hpe shawawm ai kade na sai rai?,"The passage states that Europeans were using telescopes in the 16th century. Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Tsaban 16 shawng daw kaw nna**.
"
"Matsing masat laika hta mahta nna, Muhamman na lungpu hku gaw shi a wenyi lam shaman ai (sh) manu ni hpe gara hku tsun da ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Shi gaw simsa lam hte tinang hkrai san nga ai hpe manu shadan ai**

Here's why:

*   The passage describes Muhammad spending time in the Hira cave on Noor Mountain for contemplation and self-reflection.
*   The passage emphasizes that he likes his seclusion to reflect, showing his value for silence and reflection
*   While the passage mentions the limited view from the cave, it frames it as a choice, not a source of distress.

Therefore, the text strongly supports that Muhammad valued peace and being alone for his spiritual growth.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpri hpe shawng nnan hku nna hpa hta lang ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Wagonways**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Dingsen mali leng lam ni hpe England kaw tsa ban 16 daram jau na me gaw gap lai wa sai re. Wagonways gaw hpun ni hte maren nga nga ai rai tim..."" This directly implies that wagonways existed and were used before the improvements (like adding iron) were made. The rest of the passage describes improvements to these existing wagonways. The passage details that, gradually, improvements like iron plates were added to the wagonways to make them more efficient.

The passage describes the original use of iron in the context of `wagonways`. The iron supports for roads, dingsen, and railway tracks appeared later as improvements to the wagonways.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpa majaw hpun dingsen hpe hpri dingsen hte galai shakap kau ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Shanhte gaw grau nna akyu rawng ai (They were more efficient)**.

The passage states: ""Gau ngwi ngwi gaw, lama ntsa kaw hpri pa shakap da ai rai yang, dai lam ni gaw grau akyu rawng ai lam hpe dum hprang wa ma ai."" which translates to: ""Gradually, it was realized that if iron plates were placed on the tracks, the roads became more efficient.""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gumra ni a chyang shadang grau tsaw na matu (To make the horses faster):** While the passage mentions horses being able to pull heavier loads more easily, it doesn't state that the *primary* reason for switching to iron rails was to make the horses specifically faster.
*   **C: Shanhte gaw grai li ai gunrai ni hpe lu hpai wa ai (They were able to carry heavier loads):** This is a consequence of using iron rails, but not the primary reason for the switch.
*   **D: Shanhte gaw lam ntsa nga ai hpri tawng ni a majaw hten mat ai (They were damaged by the iron spikes on the tracks):** This doesn't make sense in the context of the passage. The passage is discussing *switching* to iron rails, not problems caused by them."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Romanticism ten ladaw hta langai hkrai a hkrang hpe gara hku shalen ai rai?","The passage says that the **landscapes** (Lamu ga hpaji) in Roman literature are unique and evolve with time, adapting to the community. This aligns with the Romantic idea of emphasizing the individual character of a place or thing.

Therefore, the answer is **B: Lamu ga hpaji**.
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara ndau ai lam gaw lai ladat hte seng ai madung tawn myit jasat hpe nlu tsun dan ai ra? ,"The passage discusses how technology impacts society, leading to both progress and new problems. It emphasizes that technological advancements often require adjustments in various aspects of life, from infrastructure to healthcare.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Uhpung kata hpungtang hpaji a akyu jaw ai masa gaw shinggyim uhpawng the seng nna masat da ai** - This option fits with the passage because the passage explains that technology is something that benefits society.
*   **B: Hpungtang hpaji rawt jat wa ai lam gaw htunghking hte n seng ai** - This contradicts the passage, which mentions the influence of culture on technological development. Therefore this is the correct answer.
*   **C: Hpuntang hpaji gaw uhpung hta myi kaw na nga ai akyu jaw masa ni nga ai** - This option fits with the passage because the passage explains that technology is something that benefits society.
*   **D: Hpungtang hpaji hte seng ai rawt jat lam ni gaw mung masa hte seng ai lam ni hta n pawt gaw da ai n re** - This is a generalization but it does not contradict the passage.

**Therefore, the correct answer is B: Hpungtang hpaji rawt jat wa ai lam gaw htunghking hte n seng ai (Technological advancement is not related to culture).**"
"Matsing masa ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara gaw dawraw shingna gang ai lam hte n seng ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Ja ai nsen (Golden Sound)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes that drawing the bow downwards (lawu maga de) produces a louder (nsen kaba ai) sound and drawing the bow upwards (lahta maga) produces a softer (nsen kaji ai) sound. The passage does not use the term *ja ai nsen*.

The other options are mentioned in the passage:

*   **A: Grau kya ai nsen (Softer Sound):** The passage mentions ""lahta maga gaw nsen kaji ai hpe shapraw ai"" indicating a softer sound when drawing the bow upwards.
*   **B: chwi samyit hte bung ai kumla (Symbol resembling a comma):** The passage states ""shingna npu jahkrat kumla gaw maisau chywi samyit (sh) htumpa nkap ai ruyin hte bung ai"" indicating that the down bow symbol resembles a comma.
*   **D: Shu kaw na hpang ai (Starting from the Shoulder):** The passage mentions """"""""sha yu"""""""" ngu ai gaw dawraw shingna hpe shu nten kaw (nang dawraw shingna lang da ai shara) na agan sha yu ai ngu ai re., stating that ""sha yu"" means you draw the bow downward slightly from the shoulder where you are holding it.

"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara gaw grau nya ai nsen hte seng ai rai?","The answer is **A: Dawraw shingna npu jahkrat ai kumla**.

The passage states: ""Dawraw shingna (bow) lawu maga de nsen kaba ai hpe shapraw ai shaloi, (bow) lahta maga gaw nsen kaji ai hpe shapraw ai."" which translates to ""When the lower part of the bow produces a loud sound, the upper part of the bow produces a soft sound.""

And it also says that ""shingna npu jahkrat kumla gaw maisau chywi samyit (sh) htumpa nkap ai ruyin hte bung ai"" which translates to ""the mark indicating the lower part of the bow is like a small comb (or) a stroke without a head"".

Therefore, lowering the bow (referring to the lower part) creates a louder sound. Option A directly relates to the lower part of the bow.
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na lata ni hpe madung lang ai lam hte seng na hpang jahtum hta namhkam nlung ni madun ai lam gaw gara wa rai?,"The passage states that ""the fossil record, spanning millions of years, shows a gradual shift towards using the hands for tool manipulation.""

Therefore, the answer is **A: Lashoi jum ai** (Tool manipulation).
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw masha Chimpanzee a lagaw lata nra hte seng na jaw ai hku tsun da ai rai? ,"The correct answer is **A: Shanhte gaw masha ni hta grau galu ai**

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""Chimpanzee a lata hte lagaw ni gaw maren sha re."" and ""Shinggyim masha a lata gaw lagaw hta grau kadun ai. Lagaw nra gaw grau galu ai majaw re.""

* **This directly implies:** Chimpanzee limbs are relatively equal in length, while human limbs have disproportionately long legs and short arms. Therefore, chimpanzee limbs are longer than human arms.
"
Lata ai lam gaw gin sai hkrang n bung ai lam nnan hpe gara hpan kaw na yen kau ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Makoi ai lam**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""myu mai shalaw ai ni gaw myu kaga bai mu ai, ngut nna lata da ai hpe madun dan da ai myu ni kaw na yen kau ai."" This translates to: ""Breeders observe other breeds, and then avoid the breed they've chosen to eliminate.""

*   The question asks: ""Lata ai lam gaw gin sai hkrang n bung ai lam nnan hpe gara hpan kaw na yen kau ai rai?"" which means: ""From which form of hidden differences does selection eliminate new forms?""

*   Since ""makoi magap ai hte tsun shapraw ai"" translates to ""hidden and expressed,"" and the breeders are *avoiding* certain breeds, the selection is eliminating new forms from the *hidden* differences."
Lakung nnan amyu myu jat bang na matu gara ladat hta lit nga ai rai?,"Based on the text P, the process responsible for introducing new variations is **C: Myu mai shalaw ai lam** (Selection).

Here's why:

*   **P states:** ""Myu mai shalaw ai ni gaw myu kaga bai mu ai, ngut nna lata da ai hpe madun dan da ai myu ni kaw na yen kau ai."" This translates to ""Breeders see different types, and then remove types that don't show the selected traits."" This directly relates to selection and introducing variations through breeding/selection.

The other options are either processes that *remove* variation (A and B) or a method of communication (D) rather than a method of introducing new traits."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai lam hta mahta nna, ndai kaw na gara wa gaw “shan dat manghkang” hte seng ai manghkang hpe hparan na matu sha gying ai rai?","Based on the text, the ""shan dat manghkang"" refers to the difficulty in getting essential amino acids from available plant sources in the savanna. The text mentions that commonly available plant sources are leaves and savanna fruits, but they are difficult to digest properly and provide the necessary amino acids for survival.

Therefore, the answer that represents a source that presents a ""shan dat manghkang"" would be:

*   **B: Shapre galu katsing ni** (Savanna fruits)
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara manghkang gaw ra ai amino acid n lu ai majaw byin wa ai manghkang nre ai rai?","Based on the provided text (P), the passage explicitly links all the options to a lack of necessary amino acids, *except* for **A: Shat rin ai lam hte seng ai manghkang (Problems related to digestion)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the lack of available nutrients makes it difficult for animals to survive and leads to *myit kaji garen ai lam tsaw wa ai lam (increased anxiety/aggression), lusha n-grung ai lam (malnutrition)*, and eventually *si ai lam (death)*. All these problems are directly connected to the lack of essential amino acids.

*   While digestive issues might arise due to poor diet, the passage doesn't directly attribute ""shat rin ai lam hte seng ai manghkang (problems related to digestion)"" to amino acid deficiency. It primarily highlights the issues of not getting the necessary amino acids in the first place, which then leads to the other health complications.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Shat rin ai lam hte seng ai manghkang**"
Nbung ai htunghking ni a malawm masha ni gaw shanhte a uhpung ni hte pawng hpawn ai lam hpe gara hku lachyum hpyan ai rai?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: Uhpung hte seng na masat da ai lam ni hpe hkap la ai hku na**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that belonging to a group is identified by unique behaviors, symbolic decorations, lifestyles, and shared language. This aligns with accepting the markers and characteristics associated with the group.

Let's look at why the other options are not as suitable:

*   A: Yawng hpe gayau kau na matu shakut na (Trying to mix everything up) - The passage doesn't suggest actively trying to homogenize or blend cultures.

*   B: Shanhte na makau kaw nga ai masha yawng a makam hpe man hkra di ai hku na (Being respectful of all religions of people around them) - While respecting other people is important, it is not the central meaning of how members of a shared culture identify and express their belonging.

*   D: Hkrang hpe maka kumla hku jai lang ai hku na (Using physical appearance as symbols) - While appearance can play a role (as the passage mentions ""symbolic decorations""), it's not the primary way members understand their belonging. Belonging is understood more comprehensively through shared values, behaviours, lifestyle, and a shared language."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai ga shawn hte maren, myu baw sang hte seng na mayen maga na ni hpe garan ginhka ai lam chye galaw ai ma langai a hkrang gaw gara hku byin wa na rai?","The correct answer is **B: Ma gaw jahkrit shama ai akyang ni hte grau nna ni htep wa na**.

Here's why:

*   **Premise (P)** suggests that minority children tend to emulate the behaviors and habits of their group from an early age. If underachievement in school is a common pattern within their minority group, they might be more likely to follow that pattern.

*   **Question (Q)** asks how a child identified as belonging to a specific ethnic group, according to the initial statement, might behave.

*   **Option B** (""Ma gaw jahkrit shama ai akyang ni hte grau nna ni htep wa na"") aligns with the premise. It suggests that the child would increasingly adopt the behaviors and patterns associated with their minority group.

Here's why:

The passage describes children labeled as ""feral"" who have experienced severe neglect, abuse, or abandonment. The passage highlights how these children might:

*   Be kept hidden by their parents due to shame or misunderstanding.
*   Be abandoned due to the parents' lack of understanding about the child's differences.
*   Experience trauma similar to abused children.
*   Be raised by animals, adopting animalistic behaviors.

A myit shuk lam kaw na lu ai uhpung (sense of community), gaw shanhte hkrum n chye ai lam re. The passage focuses on isolation, abandonment, and lack of human connection. Therefore, receiving support and acceptance from a community (myit shuk lam kaw na lu ai uhpung) is what they would *not* likely experience.

The other options:

*   **Wanglu wanglang nga ai**: This is very likely, considering the circumstances of their upbringing.
*   **Ga shaga chye ai atsam ni**: While they might develop *some* communication skills, they wouldn't be typical or fluent. Language development would be severely hindered.
*   **Nta kata hta makoi rawng chye ai**: Sadly, yes. The passage mentions parents hiding these children."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw zai ai ma ni a akyang lai ni hpe jaw ai hku tsun da ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Zai ai akyang gaw shawa hte kanawn mazum n chye ai majaw byin ai re**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes how ""feral"" children, or children raised outside of normal social contact, often develop behaviors that reflect their lack of socialization. They may be shy, fearful of humans, and exhibit behaviors similar to the animals that raised them. This directly relates to a difficulty in social interaction.

Let's analyze why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Zai ai akyang lai ni byin ai hkun ai madung ai hkumhkrang hte seng na jahten hkrum ai majaw re** : The passage implies that physical damage might be *a* factor in some cases (abuse), but it's not presented as the core defining cause of all feral behaviors.
*   **C: Zai ai akyang gaw kanu kawa ni up hkang da ai ma ni kaw sha byin chye ai**: The passage specifically describes how feral children are *not* raised by parents in a typical fashion, and that they could be abandonned by their parents.
*   **D: Zai ai akyang yawng gaw bawnu nyen n hpring tsup ai majaw byin ai re**: While it's possible that some feral children may have developmental issues, the text focuses on the environmental impact of being raised without human interaction, not inherent brain development problems."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw kanbau hkai sun hpe madung dat ai hkai sun hpaji hte n seng ai rai?","The passage states that kitchen gardening focuses on meeting the needs of the gardener and their family, and that it's a natural and sustainable practice.  Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Hkauna galaw sha ai dinghku a ra rawng ai lam hpe hpring zup ya na pru shadang hpe myit maju jung na (Focus on production to fulfill the family's needs):** This aligns directly with the definition of kitchen gardening provided in the passage.

*   **B: Kaga masha ni hpe dut na matu lusha ni hpe shapraw na (Produce food to sell to others):** While a kitchen garden *could* have some surplus to sell, the primary focus isn't on commercial production. It's about family needs.

*   **C: Hpungtang hpaji ni hpe ning hkap let pru shadang law na matu myit maju jung na (Focus on maximizing production by opposing scientific methods):** The passage describes kitchen gardening as a natural and sustainable practice, which might align with rejecting some modern industrial farming methods, but it *doesn't* explicitly state that the purpose is to avoid scientific methods and maximize yield.

*   **D: Hkai tum ni hpe mung kata na hkauna galaw ai masha ni nga ai shara hta madi shadaw ya ai (Support local farmers by providing seeds):** This isn't the primary focus of kitchen gardening. It might be a beneficial side effect in some communities, but it's not core to the practice itself.

Option C is the least relevant characteristic of kitchen gardening. While kitchen gardening emphasizes natural practices, it doesn't explicitly mention opposing scientific methods to maximize output.

**Therefore, the correct answer is C: Hpungtang hpaji ni hpe ning hkap let pru shadang law na matu myit maju jung na**

Kanbau hkai sun hpaji hte seng na npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw jaw ai hku tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Dai hpe nkau shara hkan hkauna galaw ai ni ya du hkra naw jai lang ai.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Hkauna galaw ai masha law malawng gaw asak hkrung nga sa lam hkai sun hpaji hta labau hku san da hkrum wa nna dai ni ten du hkra rawt jat ai mungdan ni hta naw mu lu ai."" This translates to: ""Many farmers have historically relied on subsistence farming, and it is still found in developing countries today."" Option D directly reflects this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   A: ""Dai hta yawng gaw shingra hku na galaw ai ladat re"" - While the passage mentions natural methods, it doesn't say it's *entirely* natural.
*   B: ""Dai hta nsi nai si pru ai shadang law wa na matu laksan hpaji langai sha lang ai"" - The passage doesn't say it is solely focused on increasing yield with a single special technique.
*   C: ""Dai gaw shanhte a rapdaw kata na hkai sun hkai sha ai ni yawng shanhte a nsi nai si ni hpe mai garan hkat ai"" - The passage does not mention any sharing of the crop with the others.

**Therefore, option D is the most accurate statement based on the provided text.**"
Madun gawk ni de hkawm chyai ai lam gaw bu hkawm ai hte seng ai gara baw hpan kaw na rai?,"Based on the passage, if the goal of traveling is to learn about history and culture, it's considered cultural tourism. Visiting museums falls squarely under learning about history and culture.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Htunghking hte seng ai bu hkawm lam (Cultural tourism)**
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta ka da ai hte maren, hpa gaw ban sa na matu bu hkawm ai hpe ningshawng jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Shanhte a shani shagu galaw hkawm sa ai lam hta na hkring sa la ai** (Taking a break from their daily routines).

The passage states: ""Ndai ten gaw shinggyim masha ni shanhte shani shagu hkawm sa taw ai lam kaw na hkring sa (sh) ban sa la nna pyaw chyai na matu nbung ai shara de sa ma ai."" This translates to ""This time, people travel to different places to relax and take a break from their daily routines."" This directly supports option B.
"
Nawku hpung kata na galai shai ai lam hpe hkrit ai myit shayawm lu na lam hpe matsing masat ga yan hta gara hku tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Awngdang wa sai bungli madu myit rawng ai arawn alai a mabyin hpe shingran u**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that recalling past success stories (i.e., ""Awngdang wa sai bungli madu myit rawng ai arawn alai a mabyin hpe bai dum ai lam"") helps to reduce the fear of change within the church by inspiring a positive outlook and dispelling anxieties about the future."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, masha langai a labau hpe chye na lu ai atsam gaw hpa hpe karum ya lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Galai shai lam hpe hkrit ai myit shayawm ya lu ai**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Dai zawn re awng dang ai mau mwi ni gaw, shawng lam hta galai shai ai lam galaw na matu kaja ai hku mu na hpe ra sharawng ai myit ni hpe myit shapraw taw ai shaloi galai shai na hpe hkrit taw ai myit ni hpe shayawm kau ya nga ai."" This translates to ""Such stories of success reduce the fear of change when desires to see things positively and make changes in the future arise.""

The other options are not directly supported as the primary impact of understanding someone's history:

*   **B: Manu ni hpe n-gun shaja ai lam** (Strengthening values): While understanding history can inform and reinforce values, it's not the primary effect described in relation to individual stories.
*   **C: Uhpung kata hta shara tam la ai** (Finding a place within the organization): This is not mentioned in the given text.
*   **D: Bungli madu myit rawng ai arawn alai hte seng ai akyang ni rawt jat wa ai** (Growth of behaviors related to the employer's caring characteristics): While the passage mentions ""bungli madu myit rawng ai arawn alai,"" it is the recalling of past experiences, not specifically the act of understanding personal history, that impacts the church.
"
Npu e jaw da ai ndau lam ni kaw na gara wa gaw post modern sharin achyin ladat hpe teng ai hku tsun da ai rai?,"Based on the passage, the most accurate statement about the postmodern approach to learning is:

**B: Hkaja ai lam gaw anhte mahkrum madup na re ngu kam ai rai ni hta maju jung sharin hkaja ra ai (Learning should be grounded in what we believe to be our experiences).**

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes personal experience and the idea that learning is a product of the learner's own experiences and the knowledge shared. The passage criticizes ""postmodern sharing"" because it often involves watching experiences on TV that are disconnected from the viewer's actual life. Thus, the speaker believes that learning should be grounded in what we believe to be our experiences.
*   The passage does not explicitly state that *some* learning experiences are better than others (A) or that *some* learning methods are better than others (C). It focuses on the idea that learning should be connected to *our* experiences.
*   The passage *does* argue that postmodern sharing has limitations (D).

Therefore, option B aligns most closely with the argument presented in the passage."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara ndau lam gaw post modern sharin achyin ladat hte seng nna jaw ai hku nlu tsun dan ai rai?,"The most accurate answer, based on the passage, is **D: Galoi mung jai lang byin na nre ai hparat ni hpe sharin ai lam mung gying dan ai lam re nga ai** (Teaching methods that focus on skills that will never be used are also significant).

Here's why:

*   **The passage is critical of Postmodern learning:** It argues that a lot of Postmodern education is about learning things that are ultimately useless to the learner (e.g., watching TV shows about things you'll never do).

*   **Option D directly reflects this criticism:** It states that teaching things that won't be used is a defining characteristic (a ""gying dan ai lam"") of this type of learning.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Shiga ni hpe sharin hkaja la lu ai lam grai law nga ai** (There are many ways to learn news): While true in general, the passage is not focused on learning *news*, it is centered on what is being taught through many programs are essentially useless and do not provide good learning.

*   **B: Nkau hkaja la ai mahkrum madup ni gaw kaga ni na hta ningshawng tai gying ai** (Some learning experiences are more significant than others): The passage doesn't compare some experiences over others as being more significant, so this cannot be an answer.

*   **C: Hkaja ai mahkrum madup gaw hkaja la ai wa hte tang madun ai hparat hte seng ai** (The learning experience depends on the learner and the presentation style): This is partially true, but the main point is the practicality of it and not how you learn it.

**Therefore, D is the best answer because it captures the core negative critique of the passage: that Postmodern learning often focuses on irrelevant and unusable knowledge.**"
"Shawoi yup nga ai aten laman da sang rawt ngut ai hpang, lawu kaw na gara wa gaw yup gin jang ai bungli mahkrun hpe je bat na rai?","Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **D: Shana yup ten hta rawt nna hka bu kaw na hka lu ai** (Rising from sleep at night and drinking water from the fridge).

Here's why:

* **P** describes a method of disrupting sleep in the middle of the night and then falling back asleep. The passage suggests drinking plenty of fluids (water or a very cold drink) as a biorhythm-based method to help you wake up and feel refreshed.

* **Q** asks which of the options follows the method of interrupting sleep and then resuming it.

Option D aligns directly with the description in passage P because it involves waking up in the middle of the night to drink water. The other options do not fit the description.
"

Here's why:

*   **P** states that the sleep inertia event usually occurs while one is already asleep and involves waking up confused, lasting a short time (10-60 minutes) before potentially falling back asleep. The goal is NOT to immediately fall back asleep for hours.
*   **A, B, and C** are all explicitly stated in the description of sleep inertia in P.
"
"Bawnu gaw yup mang jahkring hkring mu na matu shakut ai hte maren, hpa baw rawt jat wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: REM masa lapran na aten**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...Ndai mabyin masa a madung madi madun ai lam gaw REM ginra ni lapran dan leng ai yupmang ni aten nau la wa ai mahtai a majaw re""  This translates to: ""...The main argument of this phenomenon is due to the **long duration between REM phases** of vivid dreams.""
* **The question asks:** Bawnu gaw yup mang jahkring hkring mu na matu shakut ai hte maren, hpa baw rawt jat wa ai rai? This translates to: As the brain tries to create vivid dreams, what increases?
The passage tells us it's the length of time *between* REM cycles that's causing the problem (and leading to fatigue). Therefore, as the brain struggles with vivid dreams, the *time between REM phases* lengthens.
"
Npu e jaw tawn da ai n kaja ai lam ni kaw na hkumhkrang hta yup mang law law mu ai rai yang gara n kaja ai lam ni byin wa na rai?,"Based on the passage, the main problem caused by frequent lucid dreams (manipulating dreams to make them seem more real) is that they can be exhausting. The passage directly states that this exhaustion is related to **prolonged, intense dreaming between REM cycles.**

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: REM masa lapran na aten ladaw ni yawm mat na (The time periods between REM phases will decrease)** - This aligns with the passage, as the intense lucid dreaming prolongs the dreaming *within* REM cycles, potentially reducing the intervals between them.

*   **B: Lana mi hta REM ni yawm na (The number of REM phases will decrease in a night)** - The passage doesn't directly say REM cycles decrease, but rather that the *duration* of the dreams within REM cycles is prolonged.

*   **C: Asan sha re ai yup mang ni hta madung ai (Focus on clearer dreams)** - This is a characteristic of lucid dreaming, not a consequence mentioned in the passage.

*   **D: Lana mi hta REM ni law wa ai (The number of REM phases will increase in a night)** - The passage suggests the opposite might happen: the long dreams within each REM phase may interfere with normal REM cycling.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: REM masa lapran na aten ladaw ni yawm mat na**.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun dai ai hte maren, yu maya hpung ni hte virtual hpung ni gaw gara hku bung ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Hpung lahkawng yen gaw bung ai madang langai hta sha hkrang shala na hpe myit mada ma ai**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that virtual teams operate similarly to in-person teams ""P: """"""Uhpang yang hpe kaja ai madang hte ayang galaw zawn galaw wa ai, raitim shai ai kaji mi nga ai. Virtual hku hkrum hkat ai hpung ni gaw shinggan kaw myi man hkrum hkrum hkat ai zawn sha bungli galaw ai."""". This implies that both types of teams are expected to perform at a similar level of quality.
*   The passage states ""Hpung lahkawng yen gaw aten langai hta sha amu galaw ma ai"" because the passage states that the time differences allow virtual teams to connect ""n-bung ai aten ahkying a majaw shanhte mai hkrum hkat ma ai hte maren ayan na yu maya hpung ni hta madu up hkang lam grau nga ai."".

Let's examine the other options:

*   **B:** The passage indicates that virtual teams have *more* self-governance than traditional teams due to time differences, not the same level.
*   **C:** The passage discusses the ""invisible team"" within the larger organization, but this isn't presented as a commonality between all virtual and traditional teams.
*   **D:** The passage does not focus on that time management is the same.

"
"Matsing masat gayan hta mahta nna, gara ndau ai lam gaw hkumhkrang hte seng ai hte virtual hpung ni hta n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Yu maya hpung ni gaw virtual hpung ni hta madu up hkang lam nau n nga ai**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""...shanhte mai hkrum hkat ma ai hte maren ayan na yu maya hpung ni hta madu up hkang lam grau nga ai."" This directly translates to ""as they can meet, conventional teams often have more hierarchy than virtual teams."" Therefore, the opposite of this statement, ""conventional teams do not have as much hierarchy as virtual teams,"" is incorrect."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw content myit sawn ai lam hku na ning pawt da ai n re ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Marai langai a grup yin gaw gara hku shanhte a galaw ai lam hta akyu jaw ai lam**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that content motivation theories focus on ""needs and desires that humans have as they age"". Options A, C, and D all relate to these internal needs and desires.

*   Option B describes how a person's environment influences their actions. While the passage mentions the surrounding environment, it frames it as influencing *whether* or *not* a person acts on their desires, not as the root source of the motivation itself. Therefore it is not a content myit sawn lam.

Therefore, option B does not directly stem from internal needs and desires, making it the outlier."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw rule of thirds a yaw shada da ai lam nre ai rai?,"Based on the provided text (P), the ""rule of thirds"" aims to help you compose aesthetically pleasing and dynamic photographs. It suggests placing key elements at the intersection points of lines that divide the image into thirds, both horizontally and vertically.

Let's analyze the answer options:

*   **A: Gin hpan ni tawn na shara hta npawt gaw ai lam ni galaw ya ai lam** (Provides guidelines on where to place objects) - This Aligns with the rule of thirds. The rule helps to plan where the different elements are placed in a photograph.
*   **B: Sumla langai hta asak hte n-gun hpe shalat yu u** (Helps create life and energy in an image) - This Aligns with the rule of thirds. A good composition can result to a more interesting and energetic photograph.
*   **C: Ginhpan hpe laksan hte akyu nga ai shara hta zing da u** (Focuses the elements on the most useful or important part) - This Aligns with the rule of thirds. The rule helps to plan where to place the focus of the picture, like the intersections points as mentioned above.
*   **D: Sumla langai hta lamang langai hpang yu u** (Think of the photography as a single process) - This is not the aim of the rule of thirds.

Therefore, the answer is **D**.

**Final Answer: D**"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw 35mm sumla gayet hkrang hpe n tsun da ai rai?,"The answer is **C: Dai hta malawng lang mai ai hkrang hta shai ai lam ni nga ai**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Dai gaw galaw shapraw ai kaw naw re:** The passage states, ""Ndai hpe dai ni hku hkra naw galaw shapraw nga ai re."" (It is still being manufactured today.)

*   **B: Dai hpe ru hkrum ladat lang ai kemra hkrang ni bau la kau sai:** The passage states, ""grau ahkyak ai hku na gaw shi a ning mu htam hpe gaw ruhkum ladat lang ai kemra sumla maju hkam hkinghku lang ai lamang la-jang masa kaw na hkring htawng dagraw lai wa sai re."" (More importantly, its field of view has been surpassed by digital camera systems.)

*   **D: Dai gaw mungkan hta malawng jai lang dik hkrang re:** The passage states, ""Lama na, ya du hkra na malawng lang dik ai sumla dem hkrang lamang gaw 35mm re"" (35mm is the most popular film format to date).

*   **C: Dai hta malawng lang mai ai hkrang hta shai ai lam ni nga ai:** The passage does not discuss any differences in the most commonly used formats; it only states the size specifications of the 35mm format.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, htuk shapraw ai ni pat a madang hpe shatsawm nna shapraw ai majaw, sumla ni hkra tsan hkra galaw ya ai jan nhpai ni gaw gara hku rawt jat wa ai rai?","Let's analyze the provided text to determine the correct answer.

The passage states:

*   ""Sumla ni hkra, tsan hkra galaw ya ai jan nhpai ni a nkaja ai akyu gaw maju jung yak ai lam, jan nhpai law law ra ai lam ni rai nga ai."" (The disadvantages of telephoto lenses are that they are difficult to handle and require a lot of lenses.)
*   ""Man balu galaw ai lam hta awngdan tsaw ai hte maren dai kaw manghkang ni yawm wa ai."" (As the success in manufacturing increases, these problems decrease.)
*   ""Ndai gaw ka'ang galu masat da ai pat nhpai hte rau ningja rawng shadawn la mai ai sumla ni hpe shapraw lu na matu zoom pat nhpai ni bang da ai."" (This includes zoom lenses that are included to produce high-quality images comparable to those taken by prime lenses.)
*   ""Laga grau kaba mai ai rai na nkaja ai lam gaw kaba dik (lawan) ai rai gaw nkaja ai re."" (The larger the aperture, the more prominent the disadvantage is the widest aperture.)
*   ""Ndai lam ni gaw manu hkyem sa ai sumla ni tsan galaw ai pat ni hpe nsin shau ai masa hta kemara kaprip wan nlawm ai sha lang na matu yak shangun ai re."" (These problems make it difficult to use inexpensive telephoto lenses in low-light conditions without a flash.)

The question asks: ""According to the text, how have telephoto lenses improved as manufacturers improve the quality of the lenses?""

Now let's evaluate the answer options:

*   **A: Shanhte hta lawan madang tsaw ai (They have a higher speed level):**  While the passage mentions aperture, it doesn't directly say that telephoto lenses have become faster. The mention of low-light performance implies needing larger apertures (lower f-numbers), which translates to potentially faster speeds, but it is not a direct statement made by the text, therefore this isn't as strong of an answer.
*   **B: Dai ni hpe nhtoi nau n nga ai masa hta rai tim aloi sha lang mai ai (They can be used more easily even in low-light conditions):** The text mentions that the disadvantages of telephoto lenses ""make it difficult to use inexpensive telephoto lenses in low-light conditions without a flash"". That implies any improvement to the lenses would allow them to be easier to use in low light conditions.
*   **C: Shanhte a sumla madang gaw ka'ang galu masat da ai pat ni zawn bung ai (Their image quality is as good as that of prime lenses):** The passage states zoom lenses are being used ""to produce high-quality images comparable to those taken by prime lenses.""
*   **D: Dai ni gaw prime pat ni hta maju jung yak ai lam yawm ai (They are less difficult to compete with prime lenses):** The disadvantages stated in the beginning make it difficult to compete with prime lenses. It's implied that an improvement would mean they are less difficult to compete with them.

Based on the details in the passage, the best answer is **D: Dai ni gaw prime pat ni hta maju jung yak ai lam yawm ai (They are less difficult to compete with prime lenses).** This is because the original disadvantage was their difficulty in handling and other issues, so improvements reduce that difficulty, enabling them to compete more effectively with prime lenses. Option C is a close contender, as it refers to comparable image quality, but the wording is indirect in comparison to option D.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states that as technology improves, problems associated with zoom lenses (like difficulty and needing multiple lenses) decrease.** This implies that zoom lenses become more attractive *when* these problems are less prominent.
*   **Option B directly addresses the problem of zoom lenses needing many lenses by stating the desire to reduce them.** This aligns with the idea that improved technology makes zoom lenses more appealing.
*   **Option A:** The passage doesn't discuss situations where a higher amount of light is preferred.
*   **Option C:** The passage says that issues of using zoom lenses make it *difficult* to use image sensors in dark environments. However, it does not suggest it's a situation where you'd choose a zoom lens *specifically because* you don't want to use a camera flash.
*   **Option D:** The passage mentions zoom lenses have issues, so it does not suggest that you'd use a zoom lens because it's a challenge."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa hpe wenyi masa a teng man ai lachyum ngu na n mai sawn la ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Wenyi lam hkan ai ni gaw Karai Kasang hte seng ai lam ningmu lu na matu karum ya lu ai shaman shakyang ai lam ni hpe hkap la mai ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage argues AGAINST the idea that spiritualism leads to genuine understanding of God.** It presents spiritualism as focused on experiences, supernatural powers, and personal gain, contrasting it with true devotion to God. It suggests spiritualism seeks supernatural experiences or wisdom for personal gain (like contacting spirits or gaining prophetic abilities) while neglecting a true relationship with a higher power. Therefore, believing spiritualism helps one understand God is contrary to the passage's core argument.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Simsa na myit pyaw ai masa lam hpe hkam sha lu wa hkra ahkyak shatai da ai:** The passage mentions that spiritualism can lead to feelings of peace and happiness.
* **B: Wenyi masa lam hkan ai ni gaw wenyi lam hte seng ai ningmu kaja ni hpe hkan tam ma ai:** The passage states that spiritualists are motivated by spiritual pursuits.
* **D: Tinang hte seng ai mahkrum madup ni tam ai lam hta numnak bang ai gaw kaga nawku hpung hte shanhte a nawku daw jau lam hte mai shingdaw yu ai:** The passage emphasizes that spiritualism values personal experiences, which can be distinguished from other religious practices.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that spirituality is about truly following God's glory and spiritual paths, not just imitating rituals. Seeking prophecy ""from things related to God"" can easily become a ritualistic imitation, rather than genuine spiritual growth.

The other options are mentioned or implied as being associated with the type of spirituality being criticized:

*   B: Garan gachyan ai, rau hkam sha ai kaw mahkrum madup ni kaw na myithtoi lam hpe hkan u (Seeking prophecy from altered states and group experiences): The passage mentions seeking knowledge and prophecy through experiences similar to those influenced by spirits or demons.
*   C: Myit pyaw ai lam hpe numnak bang ai (Prioritizing feelings of well-being): The passage associates this with the pursuit of euphoria and ecstatic experiences, which are presented as potentially misguided goals.
*   D: Karai Kasang a myit ningmu hpe hkan tam ai (Seeking God's mind): Following what's mentioned in the passage, this is in line with seeking God's glory and spiritual paths, this is an indication to follow the right path to a true spiritual growth.

Therefore, only seeking prophecy from things related to God is something that the passage would disapprove of as it can be interpreted as imitation instead of real growth."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, hkai nmai hte seng ai uhpung hpe kadai hpang wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Polynesia kaw na Maori masha ni**.

The passage states: ""Maori masha ni Great Fleet a Polynesia kaw na bu htawt wa nna Moriori kaw na New Zealand de hkai nmai hte seng ai uhpung hpe hpaw ning htan ma ai gaw..."" This translates to: ""The Maori people migrated from Polynesia in the Great Fleet and *established agricultural settlements* in New Zealand, displacing the Moriori..."" This directly indicates that the Maori people from Polynesia established the agricultural settlements that displaced the Moriori.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, moas hpe gyam ai hpung ni gaw gara shara a shawngnan shanu ai ni rai?","The correct answer is **B: New Zealand**.

The passage states: ""New Zealand a shawng nga jauman masha ni gaw Maori masha ni re nna shanhte gaw maos ngu ai u kaba ni hpe shatam sha lai wa sai nga na kam lai wa ma ai."" This translates to: ""The first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori, and they are believed to have hunted moas to extinction.""

Therefore, the group that hunted moas (the Maori) were the original inhabitants of New Zealand.

Origami a Pureland ladat hpe lang ai lam hta kapum hkang ai ni hpe gara kaw akyu jaw na rai?,"The best answer is **D: Kapum hkang ai wa gaw shawng de kalang (sh) lahkawng lang sha galaw ga ai**.

Here's why:

* **Pureland origami** is designed to be simple, with limited folds and no complex maneuvers.
* **John Smith** created it to help people with limited skills.
* Therefore, the person benefiting from Pureland origami would likely be someone with limited origami experience, likely someone who has only folded a few times.

The other options are not well supported or directly contradicted by the description of Pureland origami:

*   **A**: The person who can only move one hand would prefer making fewer folds at a time. Pureland origami is designed to make origami easier.
*   **B**: Pureland origami is designed to assist people with limited mobility, and not people who have more advanced motor skills.
*   **C**: Pureland origami is designed to assist people who have more difficulties with folding techniques, and not complex origami.

Therefore, **D** is the most reasonable and direct answer."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw Pureland origami hte seng na n jaw ai rai?,"The statement about Pureland origami says:

*   It has a limited number of folds.
*   Only simple folds are allowed.
*   More complex folds are not allowed.
*   John Smith created it in the 1970s to help beginners.

Now let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Dai gaw mahkrum madup n nga ai kapum hkang ai ni hpe yaw shada ai (It is aimed at inexperienced folders)** - This aligns with the purpose of Pureland origami as described in statement P.
*   **B: Dai hta nhtang kapum hkang ladat n lawm ai (It does not include reverse fold techniques)** - This implies that Pureland origami can involve a reverse folding method, which contradicts with statement P, which states that Pureland origami has a limited number of folds and simple folds.
*   **C: Kapum hkang ni hta loi ai shara ni sha mai lawm ai (Only easy parts are allowed in the folds)** - This agrees with the 'simple folds only' rule of Pureland origami.
*   **D: Dai gaw motor skill nau n nga ai kapum hkang ai ni a matu kaja ai mahkrun re (It is a good approach for folders with less motor skills)** - The intent of Pureland origami is to make origami accessible for beginners, including those who might struggle with more complex maneuvers, so it is true.

Therefore, the statement that is NOT true about Pureland origami, according to the given passage, is **B: Dai hta nhtang kapum hkang ladat n lawm ai (It does not include reverse fold techniques)**.

*   The passage states that the Indus Valley Civilization covered areas of modern-day Pakistan, parts of northwest India, and *northeast* Afghanistan.

The other options are directly mentioned as being part of or related to the Indus Valley Civilization."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw Magri Prat shinggyim gan ga lam a mai byin ai mying hpe matsing masat ga yan hta n madun da ai rai?,"The passage mentions the following possible names for the Bronze Age civilization:

*   **Indus Valley Civilization:** Explicitly mentioned at the beginning.
*   **Harappan Civilization:** Mentioned as a name people use, based on the site of Harappa.
*   **Indus-Sarasvati Civilization:** Mentioned as a more accurate alternative, considering the Sarasvati River.
*   **Indus River hka mayan kaw na shinggyim gan ga lam:** while this is mentioned, this isn't in the style of the other answers.

That leaves us with two possible answers. Both Indus Valley Civilization and Indus River hka mayan kaw na shinggyim gan ga lam make sense, but the question asks which is *not* considered a Bronze Age civilization name. That would have to be Indus River, since that's just the name of the river where the civilization developed.

Therefore, the correct answer is: **C**.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw ladaw galu akyu kaja hpejaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Kaga ni hte pawng ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **Premise (P)** argues that while self-interest is natural, people will realize that the best long-term benefit comes from cooperation with others.
* **Question (Q)** asks which option provides the long-term benefit according to the passage.
* **Option A (Kaga ni hte pawng ai lam)** directly aligns with the premise's conclusion that cooperation is key to long-term success. The passage argues against pure self-interest as the path to sustained benefit.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, lama marai langai ngai gaw ya jang lu ai amyat hta maju jung da ai rai yang, lawu kaw na gara hpe ningshawng jaw masat na rai?","The passage states that focusing on immediate personal gain is driven by ""tinggyeng myit"" (selfishness/personal interest). Therefore, if someone focuses on immediate gain, they are prioritizing their ""tinggyeng myit.""

So the answer is **D: Tinggyeng myit**.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, majan poi hta ma mat ai gumhpraw ni a matu kadai jaw ya ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Filipino masha ni**.

The passage explicitly states ""Filipino masha ni sha bai nhtang jaw ra ai"" which translates to ""only the Filipino people must pay back"".
"
Templars prat n re shi ai shaloi gara prat shawng sa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Shawng na ka-ang prat**

The passage states: ""Shawng na ka-ang prat ni gaw lahta ka-ang prat ni hta shawng du ai re..."". Since the Templars existed during the High Middle Ages, and the High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, the answer is C.
"
Templars prat ngut ai hpang gara prat bai sa wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Hpang na ka-ang prat**.

The passage states that the High Middle Ages (the time of the Templars) was followed by the Later Middle Ages. ""Hpang na ka-ang prat"" translates to ""Later Middle Ages"".
"
Roma Hkaw Seng ten laman na ga lajang ai ni shing nrai tsi du ni hku na gara tsi tsi lajang ai lam shing nrai ladat ni hpe n tsun da ai rai?,"The passage mentions the following treatments and techniques used by Roman physicians/surgeons:

*   Developing various sedatives, including those using opium-derived morphine and scopolamine for anesthesia.
*   Performing amputations in areas with restricted blood flow.
*   Collecting blood and dissolving blood clots to improve circulation.

Therefore, the correct answers are:

*   **C: Sai pat ai ni hpe yen nna lu hkawm hkra galaw ai** (Dissolving blood clots to improve circulation)
*   **D: Hkum kaw sai nhkawm ai ana hkam sha ai masha ni hpe hkum di kau na tsi lajang ai lam** (Amputations in areas with restricted blood flow)

Although option B is also correct (""Scopolamine a matu tsi tum ni a machyan hpe jai lang ai""), option C and D are more comprehensive and directly relate to treatments used.

**A: Myit ana hkam sha ai ni hpe myit zim tsi jaw nna tsi tsi ai lam** is also correct since the passage mentions that they used opium-derived morphine and scopolamine for sedatives.

Therefore, the best answer is the combination of **A, C and D** because they all relate to specific medical practices described in the passage. Given that I have to select only one, and considering the weight of the information in the original passage, I will select **C**

However, I recognize that this is not a completely satisfactory answer.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Roma Hkaw Seng ten hta rawt jat wa ai tsi hte seng ai shingwang hta npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw sawn la n mai ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Tsi hte seng ai hpe sharin ya ai tsi rung ni hpaw ai**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Tsi hte seng ai uhpung ni hpaw hpang wa ai lam** - The passage explicitly mentions that Augustus established the first Roman medical corps.
*   **B: Hkaw Seng mungdan kata grai sawng ai hpyen dap ladat** - While the passage mentions war as a context, it doesn't discuss specifically harsh military strategies. The focus is on the war's *impact* on medical advancements.
*   **D: Hkawseng magam a matu tsi du ni hpe lahkawn ai** - The passage directly states that Augustus collected physicians for future use.
*   **C: Tsi hte seng ai hpe sharin ya ai tsi rung ni hpaw ai** - The passage doesn't mention the establishment of formal medical schools or teaching facilities. It only mentions the establishment of a medical corps and the collection of physicians."
Mu lu ai atsam gaw gara ntsa shamyet shanat nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Myi hte mai mu lu ai hkum daw shan ni**.

The first sentence of paragraph P directly states that visual perception (Mu ai lam (sh) mu lu ai atsam) is based on the body parts that allow us to see (myi hte mai mu lu ai hkum daw shan ni).
"
Asak hkrung kanu ni shai ai myi amyu myu hkrang ni gaw hpa lam hta shamyet taw ai rai?,"Based on the passage, the difference in the way different types of living eyes (different living organisms' eyes) are shaped is due to the different needs of the living organisms. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: Asak hkrung kanu ni a matu ra rawng ai lam ni (The needs of the living organisms)**

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Tsan shadang ni hpe hkam sha lu ai (Being able to perceive distance):** While eye shape influences depth perception, the *primary* reason for variation isn't solely about distance. The passage emphasizes the underlying ""hkrung kanu ra rawng ai"" (living organism needs).

*   **C: Myit maju jung lu ai madang (Level of concentration):** Eye shape doesn't directly dictate concentration levels.

*   **D: Asak hkrung kanu ni a shuk ai lam (The speed of living organisms):** While speed can be related to vision needs, it is not the central focus of why eyes take on different shapes. The general needs and living environment are more important.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Sikhs htung hte seng na gara ndau ai lam gaw nawku hpung hte seng na jaw hkra nlu hkrang shala ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Sikhs htung a htung tara nkau ni gaw Hindu ni kaw npawt hpang da ai** (Some Sikh traditions originated with the Hindus).

Here's why:

*   **A: Sikhs htung gaw Hindu htung hking lapran garan wa ai hpung re** (Sikhism is a group that separated from Hinduism): This aligns with the passage stating Sikhs separated from Hinduism.
*   **B: Hpung sara gaw Sikhs htung a npawt madung re** (Hpung sara is the foundation of Sikhism): This also lines up because the passage says the path of teachers is important to Sikhism.
*   **C: Guru Nanak nawku hpung hpe mu tam la ai hpang hpung sara marai jahku hkan nang wa ai** (After Guru Nanak founded the religion, nine teachers followed him): This statement aligns with the fact that after Guru Nanak there were nine more teachers.
*   **D: Sikhs htung a htung tara nkau ni gaw Hindu ni kaw npawt hpang da ai** (Some Sikh traditions originated with the Hindus): This is correct and based on this phrase ""Sikhs gaw Hindu makam hkring htawng hpe hkam la da tim Hindu htung hking kaw na nbung ai makam masham hpung langai ngu sa ai.""

"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na Sikh makam ladat a alak mi re ai lam ngu gara wa hpe mai sawn la ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Hpung sara ni a ningmu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Sikhs ni gaw shanhte a nawku hpung hpe Punjabi na """"""""hpung sara ni a lam"""""""" re nga ai Gurmat ngu shaga tsun ma ai."" This directly translates to Sikhs calling their religion ""the path of the gurus"" in Punjabi, which is Gurmat. This demonstrates that the teachings and philosophy of the gurus are central to Sikhism, making it a defining characteristic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hindu ni a htung tara:** While the passage mentions that Sikhism originated within Hinduism and shares some concepts, it also emphasizes that Sikhism is a distinct religion. Therefore, aligning with Hindu traditions is not its unique trait.
*   **C: Kaga India nawku hpung ni hpe ninghkap ai:** The passage mentions that some Hindu rituals were discarded, but it doesn't characterize Sikhism as being primarily defined by opposition to other Indian religions.
*   **D: Punjabi aga hpe shaga ai:** While Punjabi is the language associated with Sikhism and the region it originated from, it is not the aspect that makes Sikhism unique among other religions. Other religions might also be associated with specific languages."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Attention Deficit Disorder hkam sha taw nga ai ma gaw gara hta maju jung na matu yak ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Jawng bungli (Schoolwork)**.

The passage states: ""ADD rau re ai ma ni gaw **jawng laika zawn re ai arai ni kaw myit maju jung na matu yak hkak ai aten ni nga ai**..."" which translates to ""Children with ADD often have difficulty concentrating on things like schoolwork...""
"
"Matsing masat ga ya hta tsun da ai hte maren, Attention Deficit Disorder hkam sha taw nga ai ma ni gaw hpa majaw dingbai dingna byin chye ai akyang ni hpe galaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Shanhte a bawnu hpe jasu ya na matu (To stimulate their brains).**

Here's why:

*   The text states ""Dai ma ni a bawnu gaw shawoi na ladat hku sharawng shara nnga ai kaw na, shanhte bawnu bungli galaw na matu dai ma ni gaw manghkang grai galaw wa na masa nga ai, hpa majaw nga yang shanhte gaw """"""""hkrit ra ai arawn alai galaw hpang ai, ga law hkat ai hte up hkang salang ni hpe dangrang hkat ai"""""""" - *Their brains are not stimulated in the usual way, so these kids are more likely to cause problems in order to get their brains to work, because they ""start doing necessary behaviors, interrupt and argue with the bosses""*
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta jaw da ai lam hta mahta nna, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara gaw scaffolding a ga shadawn nre ai rai?","The passage states that scaffolding is a tool or support that helps learners through new experiences. It can be a teacher providing structure or even a tool like the paperclip assistant in Microsoft Office. Scaffolds help to answer questions, start tasks, or explain difficult steps.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Kompyuta ginsup hpan a shawng nnan hta ladat sharin ya ai lamang:** This *is* an example of scaffolding. It directly helps someone learn a new computer program.

*   **B: SAT sharin ya ai wa:** This *is* an example of scaffolding. An SAT tutor provides instruction and support to help students learn and improve their test scores.

*   **C: Wanglu wanglang hkaja mai ai lamang:** ""Wanglu wanglang hkaja mai ai lamang"" is a vague phrase and needs more explanation on what it can do. The passage does not mention this particular service as an example of scaffolding.

*   **D: Ginsup hpung kaji a sara:** This *is* an example of scaffolding. This describes a teacher or instructor, which aligns with the passage's explanation of scaffolding.

Therefore, the option that is NOT an example of scaffolding is **C: Wanglu wanglang hkaja mai ai lamang**."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw scaffolding hte seng na n jaw ai hku tsun da ai rai?,"The incorrect statement about scaffolding is:

**C: Dai hpe lamang nnan sharin hkam la ai lam ngu mung tsun ai** (That it is also called a new learning method)

The passage states explicitly that scaffolding is *not* a learning method itself, but a support mechanism to facilitate learning. The other options are all supported by the passage:

*   **A:** Scaffold ni gaw ganghkau hta mung mai nga ai (Scaffolds can be either real or metaphorical) - This is implied by the comparison to a physical scaffold and the mention of paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
*   **B:** Dai gaw sharin hkam la ai ladat hta madi shadaw ya ai lam re (It supports the learning method) - This is the core function of scaffolding as described in the passage.
*   **D:** Scaffold ni gaw sharin hkam la ai mahkrum madup a matu shawng daw hta madi shadaw ya ai (Scaffolds support the early stages of a learning experience) - The passage states that it is used for new experiences like starting a new computer program.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C**."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara MySpace lam gaw laika hti yak ai ma ni a matu akyu nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Web shara langai**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Dai laika man de **web shara mying langai bang nna aloi sha mai shang ai**, dai gaw laika nchye ka ma jawng ma ni na matu shaloi sha mai ka na hte chye matsing na matu galaw da ai re."" (On that page, **a web address can be added and easily accessed**, which is designed for students who can't write to easily write and remember.)

The passage emphasizes that the ease of adding and using a web address is beneficial for students who struggle with literacy.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw Krushchev a bungli galaw masha kasu kabrawng ai lam ni n’tsa tai ai lam nre ai rai?","The passage states that Khrushchev responded to the Polish unrest with the following:

*   Sending tanks.
*   Making economic concessions.
*   Appointing Wladyslaw Gomulka as Prime Minister.

Therefore, options A, B, and D are all actions Khrushchev took in response to the unrest. The passage does not mention anything about raising salaries.

So the answer is **C: Shata shabrai di la hpe shatsaw ai (Raising salaries)**.
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw Poland kata na rawt malan lam a majaw byin ai lam n re ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Wladyslaw Gomulka hte hkrum zup ai lam**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Wladyslaw Gomulka was appointed prime minister as a *consequence* of the unrest, not as a cause of it. He was a concession made by Khrushchev to appease the Polish people.
*   Options A, B, and C, (Kummyunit ladat, Lusha kadawn ai, and Shabrai di la ai) are all explicitly mentioned in the passage as contributing factors to the unrest."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara gaw USA hte USSR lapran hku hkau ai lam hpe hkra machyi ai lam n’nga ai rai?","Let's analyze which of the options least likely directly contributed to the deterioration of US-USSR relations based on the provided text.

*   **A: Htunghking hte seng ai lam shai ai (Cultural differences):** While cultural differences might exist, the text doesn't explicitly mention them as a *driving force* behind the breakdown of the alliance.

*   **B: Germani hpe mu ai ningmu (Views on Germany):** The passage specifically mentions that Germany was a key battleground and that differing opinions on post-war arrangements *did* contribute to disagreements.

*   **C: Shai ai galaw hkawm sa ai lam ni (Different approaches):** The passage indicates that ideological and systemic differences contributed to conflict.

*   **D: Ladat hte seng na dangrang hkat ai lam (Tactical disagreements):** The passage mentions that proxy wars happened in multiple continents. This shows their disagreement in their strategies.

Therefore, **A: Htunghking hte seng ai lam shai ai (Cultural differences)** is the least likely to be a *direct* cause of the Cold War according to the provided text. The passage focuses more on political and military competition.
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw hkumhkrang chyam hkra a-kajawng sha byin wa ai nerve ni hpe sa ya ai lam a yaw shada lam hpe teng ai hku n tsun da ai rai?,"The passage states that the nervous system, through the network of nerves, helps maintain homeostasis to facilitate blood vessel function. It also says these signals travel quickly to protect the body from potential threats. Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Sai lwi ai hpe lanyen hkun ai (Regulating blood flow)** - The passage implies this indirectly by mentioning that the nervous system maintains homeostasis for blood vessel function.
*   **B: Sai lwi ai hpe hparan ya ai (Adjusting blood flow)** - Same logic as A.
*   **C: Homeostasis hpe mazing ya ai (Maintaining homeostasis)** - This is directly stated in the passage.
*   **D: Hkumhkrang hta byin mai ai shoihpa ni koi ya ai (Avoiding potential dangers in the body)** - This is also directly stated; the quick travel of nerve signals helps protect the body.

Therefore, all the options reflect a purpose of nerves, it is not possible to select the correct answer. I would ask for another question, but from these I believe option B is the least accurate statement.

**Final Answer: B**"
Giza Plateau hta hpa hpe mu mai ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Hkik hkam ai Jut sen lupwa Pyramid**

While A and B are *also* present on the Giza Plateau (Lupwa ni, Nawku jawng ni), D is the most *specific* and central thing mentioned in the text as being on the Giza Plateau/Giza Necropolis. C is incorrect because the text states the Giza Pyramid is *one of* the Seven Wonders, not that the Seven Wonders are *located* on the Giza Plateau.
"
Hkik hkam ai Jut sen lupwa Pyramid ni a yaw shada lam gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Pharaoh hpe chye hkungga na matu** (To honor the Pharaoh).

The passage states: ""Hkik hkam ai Jut sen lupwa gaw nnga mat sai Pharau hpe shagrau shatsaw ai masat hku gaw gap da ai..."" which translates to ""The Great Pyramid was built as a memorial to honor the deceased Pharaoh...""
"
Nawku jawng ni hpe wan nat nna jahten chye ai anhte a hparat hte seng na kadai kaw lit nga ai?,"The correct answer is **A: Ephesians ni**.

The passage states that Herostratus burned down the temple, and the Ephesians were so upset that they forbade anyone from uttering his name. While Herostratus is the one who committed the act of arson, the question asks about the responsibility for the destruction of the temple, and the Ephesians are the people who lost their temple. The other options are incorrect as follows:

*   **B: Alexander the Great:** He offered to rebuild the temple, indicating he wasn't responsible for its destruction.
*   **C: Strabo:** He was a historian who recorded the event, not responsible for it.
*   **D: Artemis:** She was the goddess to whom the temple was dedicated, and thus obviously not responsible for its destruction.
"
Armetis nawku jawng bai gawgap ai hte seng na gara wa gaw jaw ai ndau ai lam rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Alexander the Great up hkang ngut ai hpang dai hpe bai gap ai**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Dai hpang, Alexander si mat ai hpang, shaning 323 BCE kaw nawku htingnu hpe bai gaw gap lai wa sai re."" This clearly indicates the temple was rebuilt after Alexander's death.
*   A is incorrect because although Alexander offered funds, his offer was refused.
*   C is incorrect because Herostratus destroyed the temple.
*   D is incorrect as the passage notes that the reconstruction occurred in 323 BCE, not 320 BCE."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta hkan nna, lagaw lahkawng hte lu hkawm wa ai jau dik ten gaw galoi rai?","The correct answer is **A: Lai wa sai wan sanit ning hta**.

The passage states ""Lai wa sai wan sanit ning jau daw de na Sahelanthropus ni gaw lagaw lahkawng hte hkawm lai wa sa na re."" This translates to ""Sahelanthropus from around seven million years ago were probably walking on two legs."" This indicates it's the earliest instance of bipedalism mentioned in the passage.
"
Ndai kaw na gara baw hpan ni gaw lagaw lahkawng hte hkawm ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Australopithecus**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that research has found evidence of bipedalism (walking on two legs) in Australopithecus, dating back 4.2-3.9 million years.
*   While Homo Erectus is mentioned as an important bipedal species, the question asks which species from the passage walked on two legs, and Australopithecus is specifically mentioned with evidence supporting this.
*   Sahelanthropus is mentioned as possibly walking on two legs, but there's no concrete evidence like the Australopithecus remains.

So, Australopithecus is the most accurate answer based on the information provided."
Germany hka dap ni WWII hta shangut la mayu ai lam gaw hpa baw rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Britain ni hpe masha hte arai ni lu la na lam hpe pat shingdang ya ai**.

The passage states that the German navy used U-boats to try and disrupt the supply lines across the Atlantic, aiming to prevent the Americans from helping the British with troops and supplies. This directly translates to blocking Britain from receiving people and resources.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta jaw da ai lam hta mahta nna, Dingdung Atlantic arau pawng gasat ai lam hta kadai gaw hka dap gasat ai lam hta grau awngdang ai lam lu la ai rai?","Correct Answer: A: British hte Amerikan ni

Explanation: The passage states that the Americans were transporting troops and supplies across the Atlantic to help the British. It also says that the German navy tried to disrupt this by using U-boats. The passage implies that the British and Americans were ultimately successful in their efforts as Germany did not win the war."
Assyrian ni gumra dap galaw hpang ai shaloi hpa n nga shi ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Gumra hking ni**.

The passage states: ""Gumra dap ni gaw gumra hte hpyen kasat na matu re. Gumra hking hpe gin shalat ai lam rai nnga shi ai. Dai majaw Assyrian gumra dap ni gaw gumra ntsa hpa nlawm ai dai hku dung nna gasat ma ai."" This translates to: ""Cavalry was for fighting with horses. Stirrups had not yet been invented. Therefore, Assyrian cavalry fought by sitting directly on the horses with nothing underneath."" This clearly indicates that stirrups were not yet invented when the Assyrians started using cavalry.
"
Majan gasat ai hta gumra dap ni hpe gara hku lang ai rai?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: N-gang palawng n lawm ai sha**.

The text states: ""Dai majaw Assyrian gumra dap ni gaw gumra ntsa hpa nlawm ai dai hku dung nna gasat ma ai.""  This translates to ""Therefore, the Assyrian cavalry fought sitting directly on the horses without anything.""  ""Anything"" in this context refers to the lack of saddles or other equipment, implying they fought without any armor.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Babulun masha ni hpe nang gara kaw n lu tam ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Chyoi pra ai shara de wan nat hkungga la sa ai**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that only priests were allowed in the inner sanctuary, the ""chyoi pra ai shara."" It also only says that people ""la sa"" gifts to the gods. Burning sacrifice or ""wan nat hkungga la sa ai"" is not mentioned. Therefore, regular people would *not* be found taking burnt offerings to this specific area.

The other options are all consistent with the information in the passage:

*   **A: Nawku jawng wang de wan nat hkungga la sa ai**: The passage mentions that people take gifts to the gods.
*   **B: Nawku jawng ni hta poi sa ai**: The passage mentions that people bring gifts for gods to festivals and events in temples.
*   **C: Nawku jawng wang hta galaw ai poi**: The passage refers to temple courtyards."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw hkin jawng ni a matu alak mi yaw shada da ai kun?,"The correct answer is **B: Myit kata chyoi pra ai lam**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Nawku jawng shagu gaw kaba ai nawku jawng wang langai mi lu ma ai rai nna dai hpang gaw hkin jawng ni sha mai shang ai kata de na chyoi pra ai shara langai mung lu ma ai."" (Every temple had a large temple complex, and then a sacred place within it where only priests could enter.)

This directly indicates a sacred, inner place reserved only for priests, suggesting it was specially intended for their spiritual purposes and sanctification - ""Myit kata chyoi pra ai lam"" (inner sacredness).

The other options are incorrect because:

*   A: Poi lamang ni (Festival programs) - While priests were involved in festivals, the passage doesn't suggest that the inner sacred space was *exclusively* for festivals.
*   C: Poi shingra ni (Festival necessities) - Similar to A, the passage doesn't suggest that the inner sacred space was *exclusively* for festival necessities.
*   D: Hkin chyang langchyi ni (Priestly ziggurats) - Ziggurats were places of worship but not specifically for the priests alone.
"
Hkawhkam Tutankhamun gaw mying gumhkawng lam galoi lu la ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Shi a lup bai mu tam la ai shaloi**.

The passage explicitly states that Tutankhamun only became well-known after the discovery of his tomb in 1922.
"
Hkawhkam Tutankhamun hpe Egypt ni a mying gumhkawng ai hkawhkam byin hkra hpa mabyin galaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Dingbai dingna n nga ai shi a lup hpe mu tam la ai lam** (The discovery of his undisturbed tomb).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Tutankhamun wasn't considered important historically until his tomb was discovered in 1922. The tomb's intact state and the treasures found within made him famous. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.
"
Greek ga shagawp ka sara Homer gaw hpa hpe n lu di ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Mu ai** (See).

The passage states that Homer was a ""myi nmu ga shagawp sara"" which translates to ""blind poet"". Therefore, he was unable to see.
"
Mying gumhkawng ai gara Greek masha gaw laili laika hta nre sha gara kaw grau mying gumhkawng ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Pythagorus**.

The passage states that Pythagoras is widely known for his geometric theorem, which is related to math rather than literature. The other options, Homer, Sophocle and Aristophane, are described as being famous for their literary works.
"
Hebre dinghku ni gaw shanhte a aten hpe gara shara kaw grau nna shama ma ai kun?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is:

**B: Lam ntsa (Lam maga de)**

The passage states: ""Seng ni gaw lam maga de yawng nna hpaw da ai,"" which indicates that at least some of the family's activities and possibly social interactions were occurring on the street. While the women were cooking behind the house, the open stalls suggest activity facing the street.
"
Hebre dinghku ni a matu gara gaw nau n ahkyak ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Shanhte a nta**.

The passage states, ""Sinpraw Ka'ang na kahtet ai du hkra ladaw hta, nta gaw grai ahkyak nre sai."" This translates to, ""During the period of the Eastern Conquest, houses were not very important."" Therefore, houses were not as important to the Hebrew families during that time.
"
Scandinavian mungdan ni lapran shai ai lam hpe npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw n tang madun da ai rai?,"The passage mentions differences in:

*   **Labau** (History)
*   **Htung lai** (Culture)
*   **Masha ni** (People/Citizens)

The passage does *not* explicitly mention differences in **Lamu ga** (Land/Geography).

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Lamu ga**.
"
Greenland hta kadai shawng nga wa sai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Eskimo bawsang ni**.

The text states, ""Eskrimo bawsang grup ni gaw dai aten kaw na dai shara kaw nga wa sai re."" This directly translates to ""Eskimo groups had been living there since that time.""
"
Gara uhpung gaw shana shat sha yang lahkum lang ai hpe grau ra sharawng ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Matsan ai Roma num ni**

The passage states: ""Shai ai lam laga langai gaw matsan ni dum lahkum kaw dung nna num ni hte shanhte lusha sha taw ai ten, lu su ai ni gaw shanhte lusha sha na matu shanhte hkring sa gawk hta hkik hkam lusha sha ku ni hte re hpe ra sharawng ma ai."" This translates to: ""One difference was that the poor preferred to sit on sacks on the floor and eat with women, while the rich preferred proper dining tables in their resting rooms for their meals."" Therefore, poor people (specifically mentioned in the context of eating with women) preferred sitting on sacks to eat their meals.
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw Moi na Roma ni a lusha poi hte n seng ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: U magwi shadu bang da ai n-gawt**

Here's why:

*   **P** says ""moi na Roma ni mung u magwi hpe galoi nshadu sha ga ma ai."" (Ancient Romans never ate turkey).
*   The other options (**A, B, and C**) are all mentioned or implied in the first paragraph of the prompt."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw akyu grai na hkra nga na matu mahkoi nre ai rai?","The passage indicates that small cultures (htung hking kaji) are often lost or absorbed into larger, more dominant cultures and don't get the opportunity to leave a significant historical mark. Therefore, the answer is **B: Htung hking kaji** (Small cultures). This is because the passage says small cultures are less likely to leave a lasting mark and thus are less likely to benefit from having their history recorded.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, mungdan langai a matu hpa gaw ningshawng re ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Mare rapdaw (Mare mungdaw)**.

The passage states: ""Mare mungdaw ni gaw mungdan ni a ningshawng rai nga ai."" This translates to ""City-states are the precursors to countries."" Therefore, city-states are the primary building blocks, the forerunners of nations, according to the text.
"
Drukgyal Dzong a lam hte seng na gara ndau lam gaw n jaw ai rai?,"The incorrect statement is **A: Dai gaw Tibetan-Mongol hpyen dap ni a majan dang ai lam hpe poi galaw ai na mat gap da ai** (It was built to celebrate the *defeat* of the Tibetan-Mongol forces, not their victory). The passage explicitly states it was built to commemorate Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel's victory over them.  The other statements are accurate based on the passage.
"
Drukgyal Dzong shara hta byin ai wan hkru ai lam a mahtai hpe gara ndau lam gaw teng ai hku tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel a sumla langai sha sali wunli hku nna ngam ai**.

The passage states, ""Shaning 1951 kaw gaw, wan gaw Drukgyal Dzong a sali wunli nkau myi sha, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal a sumla jawn re ai ni hpe sha ngam mat hkra galaw lai wa sai.""  This directly translates to the fire in 1951 leaving only some relics, specifically a portrait of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara ndau lam gaw Cambodia hte seng na jaw ai rai?,"Based on the provided text (P), the correct answer is:

**D: Thai ni gaw Phnom Phen hpe jahten kau ai**

The text states: ""Thai masha ni gaw tsa ban 18 hta Cambodia mungdan hpe hpyen n-gun hte grai lang shang gasat wa sai, 1772 ning hta Phnom Phen hpe jahten kau ma sai."" which translates to ""The Thais heavily invaded Cambodia in the 18th century, and in 1772 they destroyed Phnom Phen.""
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara ndau lam gaw Cambodia a shang gasat ai lam hpe jaw ai hku tsun da ai rai?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is:

*   **A: Vietnam ni gaw Cambodia hpe grai lang htim gasat yu ai** and **D: Thai ni gaw Cambodia hpe grai lang shang gasat yu ai**

**Explanation:**

The text states:

*   ""Thai masha ni gaw tsa ban 18 hta Cambodia mungdan hpe hpyen n-gun hte grai lang shang gasat wa sai"" (The Thais attacked Cambodia many times with military force in the 18th century). - Supports D
*   ""Tsa ban 18 jahtum na shaning ni hta Vietnam gaw Cambodia de hpyen n-gun hte shang gasat ai."" (In the late 18th century, Vietnam attacked Cambodia with military force.) - Supports A

Option B is partially correct, but not fully accurate as it implies both attacked in 1772. The text only mentions the Thais destroying Phnom Penh in that year.

Option C is incorrect as the text states the Thai, not Vietnamese, destroyed Phnom Penh."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gawDutch na Sinpraw India Hpaga hpung ni Taiwan kaw nga ten lamanhpa hpe n galaw wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Taiwan kaw na Qing hkawhkam wang du hkra up hkang mayu ai**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the Qing dynasty controlled Taiwan after the Dutch. Therefore, the Dutch East India Company could not have tried to control Taiwan until the Qing Dynasty.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: Zinglawng a dingda sinna maga hta npawt langai nga ai** (Had a base in the southwest of the island): The passage explicitly states the Dutch established a base in the southwest of Taiwan.
*   **B: N-gu, jum dwi zawn re ai rai ni hpe shawng lu htuk shapraw na matu shaman ai** (Encouraged the production of products like rice and sugar): The passage mentions the Dutch introduced new agricultural techniques to improve production.
*   **C: Dai masing hta miwa bungli galaw ai masha ni hpe bungli jaw ai** (Employed Chinese laborers in the project): The passage clearly states the Dutch recruited Chinese laborers.

Therefore, the only option that the Dutch East India Company **did not** do is **D**."
Shimonoseki ga shaka gaw gara hku hpang wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Taiwan ntsa na Japan ni a ahkaw ahkang (Japan ni a ahkaw ahkang).**

The passage states that the Qing government ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan via the Treaty of Shimonoseki after losing the First Sino-Japanese War. Therefore, the Treaty of Shimonoseki initiated Japanese sovereignty over Taiwan."
Dat jasat pH madang hpe gara hku shadawn ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Dat jasat hta rawng ai Hydrogen ion ni a shadawn shadang**

The passage explicitly states: ""Dai pH madang gaw chemical jep da ai kaw na Hydrogen (pH kata na H) ion kade lawm ai hpe madi madun ai."" (That pH level indicates how much Hydrogen (H in pH) ions are present in a chemical substance.)

Therefore, pH measures the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution.
"
Hydrogen ions kaw nna hpa hpe shawkau ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Myihprap yi dat rawng ai shing mun ni**.

The passage states: ""Hydrogen myihprap yi la dat banshi ni gaw shanhte a myihprap yi dat rawng ai shingmun ni hpe la kau hkrum ai myihprap la dat rawng ai shingmun ni rai nga ai."" This means hydrogen ions are hydrogen atoms that have lost an electron. Because atoms are electrically neutral, the electron removed comes from the atom, leaving it with a postive charge, that becomes an ion.
"
Npu e jaw da ai lam ni kaw nna hkanghkyi dabang hpe teng ai hku n tsun da ai rai?,"The passage states: ""Hkanghkyi ni gaw chyahkyawn (sh) gwi uhpung lai len zawn re ma ai, du sat ni gaw nmyit mada ai sha hkanghkyi ni hte bung taw chye ai.""  This means they *do* have hunting habits similar to dog packs. Therefore, A is incorrect.

The passage discusses the strong relationships between mothers and daughters, implying a different relationship dynamic than that of mothers and sons. This suggests that B, ""Ala hte ayi na ruk gaw maren n re ai"" (The relationship between sons and daughters is not the same), is likely true based on the passage's implication.

The passage says families (mothers and daughters) have close bonds. Therefore, C, ""Ayi hte ala ni gaw yawng matut mahkai lam nga ai"" (Mothers and sons all have connections), is not necessarily true.

The passage implies the hkanghkyi are alive as they are described as living in groups, having families, and hunting. So, D is incorrect.

Therefore, the best answer is B.  The other options are either explicitly stated in the passage or can be inferred from it. Option B is closest to describing how Hkankhyi are unique from other animals.
"
Npu e jaw da da ai kaw na gara gaw hkanghkying a akyang ni hte seng nna jaw ai hku n tsun dan da ai rai?,"The passage states:

*   Hkanghkyi live in groups (P: Hkanghkyi ni gaw uhpung masha hpawng hta...). So, A is true.
*   Hkanghkyi are compared to jackals or dog packs (P: Hkanghkyi ni gaw chyahkyawn (sh) gwi uhpung lai len zawn re ma ai...). So, B is true.
*   The passage states the adults closely watch over their young (P: ngut na shanhte a ashu ashan ni hpe si si htan htan nan hkan ma ai). However it says that the adults (not specifically only the parents) closely watch over their offspring. So, C is true.
*   The passage explicitly states that their behavior is *not* similar to other large cats (P: ... du sat ni gaw nmyit mada ai sha hkanghkyi ni hte bung taw chye ai (tim kaga kaba ai lanyau ni nlawm ai)...). So, D is false.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D**.
"
Brangtai ni gaw gara a matu ashu shan rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Grai kaba ai nyau ni**.

The passage states that large cats eat animals the size of chickens and squirrels.
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw nna nyau kasha ni gaw gara wa hpe gyam ma ai kun?,"The correct answer is **A: Gawa atup sha chye ai dusat**

**Explanation:**

*   The passage states that originally, the ""Shanhte a lawu na ni"" (older generations of cats) ate ""brangtai kaw na zau nyi ni hte shat nga ni ram kaba ai pran wa madang ashu ashan ni"" (animals the size of rabbits and rats from the plains).
*   Later, the passage says that the newer generations of cats (including domestic cats) are able to eat ""insect, yu, tak te hte u ni zawn akawng ni"" (small things like insects, mice, lizards and birds).

The question is asking what small game the new generations of cats are able to catch. The listed options of B (Brangtai), C (Shat nga ni) and D (Zau nyi) are all things the original, older cats ate, not the newer, smaller game that the new generations of cats catch. The only appropriate answer for what small game new generations of cats catch is gawa atup sha chye ai dusat, as the list gives examples of this, in the form of insects, mice, lizards and birds. Therefore A is the correct answer."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na ocelot nyau ni a shan hkwi ladat n re ai gaw gara wa rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Shanhte a ashu shan hpang de shana e hkan ai.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ocelots hunt during the day (""Shanhte gaw shana kaw maung chye hkawm ma ai ngut nna grai lawan ai re"").
*   The other options accurately reflect the hunting tactics described in the text:
    *   A: Shanhte a grupyin hkan hpyen wa n chye hkra makoi nga ai (They hide to ambush their prey.) - ""nam nyau ni gaw makoi nna shan nga ni hpe gumhtawn nna rim sha ma ai."" (Ocelots hide and ambush their prey).
    *   B: Shanhte a ashu shan ni a sama hpangde hkan nang ai (They follow the scent of their prey) - ""Hpungtang hpaji ninghkring ni myit ai lam gaw hkan ni gaw shanhte hte sha na dusat dumyeng (ashu ashan) ni hpe bat manam ai hku, shanhte hte gara ga hkan nga lai wa ai hpe ladi ashut nna hkan nna tam la ai re."" (Scientists think that ocelots find their prey by following their scent).
    *   D: Kaji ai ashu sham ni hpe sha gyam chye ma ai (They mainly hunt smaller animals) - ""Shanhte rim sha ai dusat malaw gaw shanhte hta grau kaji ai hpa ni hpe re."" (Most of the animals they hunt are smaller than them)."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara gaw ocelot nyau a lam hpe jaw ai hku n tsun da ai rai? ,"The correct answer is **C: Shanhte a manam lu ai atsam gaw yawm ai (Their sense of smell is weak)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that researchers believe ocelots use their sense of smell to locate potential prey, even familiar domestic animals. This directly contradicts the idea that their sense of smell is weak.

The other options are supported by the text:

*   **A: Shanhte gaw shana e shan atsawm sha gyam lu ai (They hunt well during the day)** - The passage mentions that they often walk around during the day.
*   **B: Shanhte gaw sumnung ai hku shamu shamawt lu ai (They can move swiftly)** - The passage says that they are very fast.
*   **D: Shanhte gaw kaji ai ashu shan hpe sha gyam mayu ma ai (They prefer to eat small animals)** - The passage indicates that they mostly hunt animals smaller than themselves."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa hpe sharaw a ja dik ai n-gun ngu na n mai myit la ai rai?,"Based on the passage, the activities the tiger is able to do are:

*   Climbing
*   Swimming
*   Jumping

The passage also mentions that tigers roar, but while tigers roar, the passage states the roar is not as good as other members of the family.

Therefore, the answer is **A: Marawm shabam ai** (Roaring)."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, sharaw hte hkanghkyi a shai ai lam ni gaw gara wa rai?","The correct answer is **B: Shanhte a marawn shabam lu ai atsam**.

The passage explicitly states that while leopards (sharaw) can roar, their roar is not as powerful or full as a tiger's (hkanghkyi), but it is more varied.
"
"Matsing matsat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Robert Hooke gaw kaga nsoi hpaji ninghkrin ni hta hpa shawng di wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Lawk kaji hpe sawk tam ai**

The passage explicitly states that Robert Hooke was the first to see cells (described as ""man bung lawk kaji ni"") under a microscope. The other options are not as accurate based on the information provided:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't specify whether the cells he saw were dead or alive.
*   **B:** While he used a microscope, the passage emphasizes his *discovery* of cells, not just the act of using a microscope to view them.
*   **D:** The passage doesn't mention if Hooke saw small particles.
"
Cell ngu ai gasi a n pawt lachyum gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Gawk kaji**.

The passage states: ""Cell ga si gaw Latin ga kaw na sa wa nna de lachyum gaw gawk kaji ngu ai re.""
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta ka da ai hte maren, dusat ni malawng hta hpa galaw lu na atsam nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Shamu shamawt ai**.

The passage states: ""Dusat malawng gaw shamu shamawt chye ma ai."" This directly translates to ""Most animals can move"".

While the passage also mentions flying, digging, and swimming, it specifically states that *most* animals have the ability to move.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta jaw da ai hte maren, nkau dusat ni hta hpa n nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Bawnu ni**.

The passage states: ""Dusat ni hta sha bawnu rawng ai (tim dusat ni yawng hta gaw nrawng ai; lama na, panglai baluk hta bawnu nrawng ai)."" This means some animals have brains, but not all.
"
Jan kaw hpun lusha shabyin ai ladat hte galaw ai lam hta hpun ni hpe hpa gaw karum ya ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Jan**.

The passage states: ""Hpun ni gaw shanhte a lu sha hpe **jan kaw hpun lusha shabyin ai ladat** hte galaw la ma ai."" This directly says that the sun is involved in the process of photosynthesis (jan kaw hpun lusha shabyin ai ladat).
"
Masha ni sa sharaw ai nsa hpe hpun ni gara hku chyup la ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Carbon dioxide**.

The passage states: ""ngut nna masha nsa sa shapraw ai (dai gaw nsa sa shale ai lam) carbon-dioxide hpe shanhte bai nsa sa la ma ai"" which translates to ""and then they absorb the carbon-dioxide that humans exhale (which is exhaled air)"".
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai ga shadawn ni kaw na gara gaw galu gaba ai lam hpe pat shingdang ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Uhpung kaji ai ni gaw shara nnan hta sak hkrung na matu hkrat sum ma ai**

Here's why:

*   **The passage describes speciation as a process of adaptation and divergence.** Speciation happens when a population is isolated and evolves independently in a new environment. The key elements are adaptation to the new environment and eventual reproductive isolation.

*   **Option A (Uhpung kaji ai ni gaw shara nnan hta sak hkrung na matu hkrat sum ma ai) points to the opposite of adaptation.** If small groups fail to survive in a new environment, there is no opportunity for adaptation and divergence, therefore no speciation will occur. Thus, evolution is blocked.

Let's look at why the other options are not correct:

*   **B: Shara nnan de htawt mat wa ai masha jahpan langai a dawchyen** A population moving to a new place is the first step of speciation, not the inhibition of evolution.
*   **C: Masha jahpan gaw shara nnan hta nga man na matu shaman ya ai** Population adapting to live in a new environment is an important part of speciation, not the inhibition of evolution.
*   **D: Masha jahpan gaw hpang jahtum hta hpan hkawng byin wa ai** Population eventually becoming two species is the result of evolution, not the inhibition of evolution."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw speciation byin wa ai lam hpe teng ai hku ntsun da ai rai? ,"The correct answer is **A: Dai gaw masha jahpan nnan gaw grupyin nnan hta chye nga hkra n lu galaw ai rai yang byin ai**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the opposite of option A. It says that the *new populations DO adapt* to their new environments over time. It is this adaptation that leads to divergence and eventually speciation.

The other options are all true based on the passage:

*   **B: Dai gaw galu gaba ai lam a ahkyak ai ningmu re** - ""dai speciation ni gaw ayan byin nna galu gaba ai lam hta grai ahkyak ai re.""
*   **C: Dai gaw amyu hpan nnan byin wa ai lam hpe madi madun ya ai** - ""Anhte shaga ai gaw speciation re, dai gaw myu nnan ni a ningpawt re.""
*   **D: Dai byin ai lam gaw koi kau n mai ai lam re** - ""dai speciation ni gaw ayan byin nna"". ""Ayan byin nna"" means it happens constantly.
"
Sai gayin ai ladat hta gara wa gaw sai hpe salum de sa ya ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Gindai ni**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""tube kata hku salum de bai wa ai hpe sai ginhtan lasa ngu tsun ai"" which translates to ""the blood that returns to the heart through the tubes is called sai ginhtan lasa"". Sai ginhtan lasa literally translates to ""blood return veins/vessels"", which are *veins*. Gindai ni translates to ""veins""."
Gara tingrat gaw sai gayin ai ladat a kaji dik ai wa rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Sai lam ni**.

The text says ""Grai kaja ai tube ni hpe gaw kara zawn grai kaji ai sai lam ni ngu ai."" This translates to ""Very small tubes are called very fine hair-like blood vessels."" Thus, blood vessels are the smallest components described.
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw shingtai sumpra ni a singkaw bai zing ai atsam hpe jat ya ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Shara makoi ai**.

The passage explicitly states that the ability to fold their wings gives insects a ""greater advantage of fitting into smaller spaces to hide from predators."" This directly relates to finding hiding places (shara makoi ai).
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na hpa gaw shingtai sumpra ni a pyen lu ai lam a majaw akyu nga ai lam hpe matsing masat ga yan hta n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Asak ladaw (Lifespan)**.

The passage mentions how the ability to fly helps dragonflies with:

*   **Lusha mahkawng ai (Gathering food):** ""usha tam sha ai lam, uli lung ai lam ni hta grau masan ma ai"" - more efficient in finding food and hunting.
*   **Tsam rawng ai lam (Avoiding predators):** ""hpyen ni kaw na mung aloi sha yen kau lu ai"" - easier to escape from predators.
*   **Shangai shaprat ai lam (Reproduction - indirectly):** The passage doesn't directly link flying to reproduction but it does say they are more successful at hunting and finding food, which indirectly supports their survival to reproduce.

Lifespan is not mentioned in the passage."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw dinosaur ni hte n seng ai laklai ai kumla rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Amun nga ai**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** The passage states that dinosaurs are different than birds because ""shanhte kaw amun hte chye pyan ai tsing kaw ni nga ai"".

The other options are traits shared between dinosaurs and birds, according to the passage:

*   A: Hpang lagaw hte hkawm ai - The passage states birds ""T-Rex ni zawn hpang lagaw lahkawng hte lam hkawm ma ai.""
*   C: Di di ai - The passage states that birds ""gaw di di chye ai""
*   D: Lagaw lamyin nga ai - The passage states birds use their ""lata kaw na lamin ni hte sha ai"".

Therefore, amun (or amniotic eggs) are presented as a difference, not a similarity."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw nna dinosaur ni hte u ni a n bung ai laklai ai kumla ngu nna gara wa hpe n mai sawn la ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Pyen lu ai atsam lu ai**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Di di ai:** Dinosaurs (or at least some) are believed to have been able to produce various vocalizations, including something that could be interpreted as cooing.
*   **B: Hpang lagaw lahkawng lang na lam hkawm ai:** Many dinosaurs, like the T-Rex, walked on two legs.
*   **D: Lamyin lawm ai lagaw:** Both dinosaurs and birds have scaled legs.
*   **C: Pyen lu ai atsam lu ai:** While some dinosaurs may have had feathers, the ability to fly is a distinct characteristic of birds.

Thus, the key difference is the ability to fly."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Triceratop gaw cycad a gara daw hpe sha ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Hpun mat**.

The passage states: ""Triceratop ni gaw dai hpun mat hpe nsha shi yang alap ni hpe shi ngup masen hte yeng kau lu ai."" (Triceratops could tear off the leaves with its beak before eating the cones.)
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw nna Triceratop gara ni hpe ra sha ai rai? ","The passage states that Triceratops likely ate cycads. The description of cycads matches option B: ""Grai ja ai lakung ni nga ai hpun"" (Plants with thick, palm-like leaves).  Therefore, the answer is **B**.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw nna Itali mung dingdung de nga ai mungdaw ni hta gara ginsup hpan gaw grau nna gumhkawng ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Hkyen jawn ai**.

The passage states that ""Kashung ta kaw galaw ai n-gun ginsup lamang ni gaw dingdung maga na mungdan ni hkan grai mying kaba ma ai,"" which translates to ""Winter sports are very popular in northern countries."" While the passage doesn't explicitly list which *specific* winter sports are popular, cycling (Hkyen jawn ai) is a sport done during the Winter. Therefore, it is the most probable answer, and the only one that refers to Winter.

The other options are incorrect:
*   A: Bawlung (Soccer) - A popular sport throughout Italy, not specifically the North.
*   B: Lata bawlung (Volleyball) - Also a sport played all over the country.
*   D: F1 mawdaw gau shingjawng ai (F1 car racing) - Is not a seasonal sport
"
"Masting masat ga yan hta mahta nna, npu e jaw tawn da ai ginsup hpan ni hta gara wa gaw Itali mung hpe mungkan a ginsup ninghkrin poi hta dang wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Gawdin** (Football/Soccer).

The passage states: ""Itali a myu sha gawdin hpung gaw 2006 hta FIFA Mungkan Kumhpa Gawm ninghkring re..."" which translates to ""The Italian national football team won the FIFA World Cup in 2006..."" This directly confirms that Italy was victorious in football/soccer at the world level.
"
Gara mabyin ngut ai hpang Luxembourg a nkau daw chyen ni gaw Belgian byin wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Belgian Revolution hpang**.

The passage states: ""Belgium na ya aten ni gaw Luxembourg na moi na aten ni re raitim Belgian gaw shaning 1830 Belgian Revolution hpang byin wa ai re."" This directly indicates that some parts of Luxembourg became Belgium after the Belgian Revolution.
"
Npu e jaw tawn da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw Luxembour a wahkrang nga masa hpe hkra machyi shangun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: German ni a up hkang ai lam (The control of the Germans)**.

The passage states that during both World War I and World War II, Germany occupied Luxembourg. This directly indicates a negative impact on Luxembourg's sovereignty and therefore its independence. The other options do not accurately reflect an impact on the independence of Luxembour.
"
Europe kata hta Turkey a lamu ga gaw kade square kilometers nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The passage states: ""23,764 square kilometres (9,174 sq mi) gaw Europe maga hkran de re"" which means that 23,764 square kilometers is in Europe.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Turkey gaw mile kade ram galu ai rai?","The passage states: ""Turkey madu ai ginwang ni gaw 1,600 kilometers (1,000 mi) galu...""

Therefore, the correct answer is D: 1000.
"
Vatican mare kaba hta Latin ga hpe hpa na matu jai lang ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Nawku htung hte seng ai poi ni**

The passage states: ""Latin ga hpe gaw nawku htung hte seng ai poi shingra hkan jai lang ma ai."" This directly indicates that Latin is used for religious ceremonies.
"
"Vatican mare kaba hta, Italy ga hpe hpa na matu lang ai rai?","The correct answers are A and B.

The passage states: ""Vatican mare kaba kaw gaw Italy ga hpe shi a upadi ka lajang ai lam hte tara shang matut mahkai ai lam hta jai lang ai re."" This translates to: ""In Vatican City, the Italian language is used for drafting laws and for official communication.""

Therefore, the answers are:

*   **A: Tara upadi ka lajang ai lam** (Drafting Laws)
*   **B: Tara shang matut mahkai lam** (Official Communication)"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw prat dep kompyuta nsen shatsawm ai lam kaw nna akyu lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Yu ngwi**.

The passage states ""Yungwi hpe ayan na prat dep kompyuta lang nna nsen ni gayau lang na matu nsen rim da ai,"" which translates to ""Yungwi constantly uses modern computers to record sounds to mix sounds."" This directly indicates that Yungwi benefits from modern computer sound enhancement.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Santorini**.
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara shara kaw madang tsaw namdum gawda hkrang hpe mu lu ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Santorini**.

The passage states: ""Ngam ai namdum gawda hkrang ni hpe Crete zunlawng na Minoan mare hkan hte Greece mungdan na Santorini zunlawng ni hkan nga ai nta ni hta mu lu ai."" This directly translates to ""Remnants of advanced toilet structures were found in homes in Minoan cities on the island of Crete and on the island of Santorini in Greece.""

While Harappa is mentioned as having advanced sanitation systems, the question specifically asks where the *structures* themselves were found. The passage only mentions finding them in Santorini and Crete.
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw skate jawn ai wa hpe lu gayin hkun ai rai?,"The answer is **A: Skate nhtu npu hta nga ai kashawt ai baw magaw**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes how the curved blades (kashawt ai baw magaw) on the skates allow the skater to turn.** The curve allows them to lean and direct their momentum.
* The passage states, ""Nhtu a htum pa maga gaw magaw taw ai majaw, nhtu a lahkawng yan maga nchyan de, ndung gaw hkyen hte hkra taw ai majaw magaw taw nga ai."" (Translation: The end of the blade is curved, so both sides of the blade are sharp. The back touches the ice and it curves.)
* The passage further explains that leaning to the right will cause the skater to move to the right, and leaning to the left will cause them to move to the left, directly linking the curve to the ability to turn.

Let's look at the other options:

* **B: Skate nhtu dingren a matu lahkawng:** While skates have two blades, it's the *shape* of the blades (the curve) that allows turning, not just the presence of two blades.
* **C: Skate jawn ai masha a kung kyang ai madang:** Skill level is important, but the *mechanism* that allows turning is the blade itself.
* **D: Hkyen pa madang:** The quality of the ice is important for skating in general, but doesn't directly cause the *turning* motion.

Therefore, the curved blades are the direct cause of the ability to turn."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, prat dep skate ni a nhtu ntsa kaw nga ai hku a lam hpe npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw jaw ai hku sanglang da ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Ding yau ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ndai nten lahkawng gaw hkyen pa ntsa e **ding yau mat yang pi n galau hkra magra da ya lu ai**.""  This directly translates to ""These two blades, even when **perpendicular** to the ice surface, help maintain balance and prevent slipping.""

Therefore, the ""hku"" (which translates roughly to ""hole"" or ""way"") on the skate blade is related to how the blades stay perpendicular to the ice, providing grip and stability.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, atom ni gaw ninghtoi kaw na jan pru wa ai dat atsam hpe shapraw kau ya lu ai ladatgaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **B: Photon ni shapraw ai lam hpe jasu alun ya ai** (Producing photon particles).

The passage states that atoms in light release energy by producing photons. The photons are created when atoms are energized by heat (from fire) and then release that energy in the form of light (photons).
"
Atom langai kaw na photon shapraw ai lam gaw gara hku byin ai rai?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is:

**C: Zim n re ai dat n-gun madang ni** (Unstable energy levels)

Here's why:

* The passage states that the production of photons (light particles) from atoms is linked to radio waves.
* It mentions that the energy levels in the atoms are related to the release of photons.
* The passage says that the atoms get energy and emit photons.

The idea is that atoms in the flame get energy, and when their electrons transition to a lower, more stable energy level, they release the excess energy as a photon (light).
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta hkan nna, hpa gaw hpang jahtum hta wan pu langai hpe bungli galaw hkring mat hkun mai ai rai?","The passage states that the light bulb stopped working because ""wan pu kaw na wan sumri ni gaw hkru wa ai ngut nna wan pu mung bungli ngalaw mat sai."" This translates to ""the light bulb's filament burned out and the light bulb stopped working.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Wan pu kata na waya sumri kaji ni hkru mat ai (The light bulb's filament burned out).**
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na wan pu galai shakap ai ten hta gara hpe hkra ai gaw dingbai dingna byin wa chye rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Wan pu a npawt** (The base of the lightbulb).

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes that if you touch the base of the lightbulb without cutting the power, you could get shocked because the electrical current will still be present in the socket.
*   The passage clearly states that touching the socket will cause you to be shocked from the current."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, nucleus ga garan mat yang hpa byin na rai?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Dat atsam shapraw ai**

The passage states: ""Nucleus hte kabai ai hta ngun ni hpe dat kau"" which translates to ""Striking the nucleus releases energy"". This directly implies that when a nucleus splits, energy is released.
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw galu ai tsan gang shadang kaw nna mungkan ga de matut mahkai ai lam hpe ginhtang ya ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Jak shagan ni** (Satellites).

The passage explicitly states ""Jak shagan ni gaw matut mahkai lu ai hte kalang ta ngu na daram shanhte hpe npu de bai htoi ahkung dat ya ai re"" which translates to ""Satellites facilitate communication and relay signals back down to us almost instantaneously."" This directly indicates their role in long-distance communication back to Earth.
"
Ganghkau de sumtsan yu myiset ni bang na matu ndai kaw na hpa ni hpe lang ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Rocket ni**.

The passage states: ""Jak shagan hpe hpungtang lamu ganghkau kata de gaw rocket hte shalung dat ai re."" (Satellites are launched into orbit by rockets.) and ""Hpungtang hpaji ninghkring ni gaw sumtsan yu myiset ni hpe hpuntang lamu ganghkau kata e lang nga ai"". So, to get the telescopes into orbit, rockets are used.
"
Aten ma mat ai lam hpe sawk yu na matu lagaw leng jaw ai mabyin langai hte seng nna gara lam hpe sadi da ra na kun?,"The passage focuses on the nature of time, and how we perceive and measure it through recurring events. It defines time as a measurement of duration and mentions how we can observe past events to gauge its passage.

Given the context, the question asks what aspect of a bicycle trip would be most relevant when investigating the passage of time. Out of the options:

*   **A: Aten ladaw** (Time period) - Directly relates to the length of the bicycle trip and therefore is the most relevant answer.
*   **B: Kahtap gala galaw ai lam** (Recurring actions) - Could be relevant, however not the most relevant option.
*   **C: Akyu nga ai lam** (Benefits) - This refers to the advantages of the bicycle trip and is not related to the passage of time.
*   **D: Yak hkak ai lam** (Difficulties) - This refers to the challenges encountered during the bicycle trip and is not related to the passage of time.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Aten ladaw**."
"Matsing masat ga ya hta tsun da ai hte maren, aten hte shingdaw na matu gara mabyin masa ni hpe lang wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Kade ram na ai lam** (How long things take).

The passage states that time is about judging ""kade ram na ai hpe shingdaw maram yu ai"" (how long things take in events).
"
"Matsing masa ga yan hta ka dai ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na hkaw hkam aya hkam la na matu gara wa hpe yu yu ngu na sawn la mai ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Hpyen dap de shang na matu dakkasu shangut la ai**.

The passage states that the throne (hkaw hkam aya) will be transferred to the military after Jawng ngut ai (after graduation). Therefore, the expectation is that the next in line would first complete their military training (hpyen dap de shap da na re). The details about Charles's education are background information, not the reason he would be chosen for the throne.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta jaw dai ai lam hpe mahta nna, Charles shawng nna galaw ai lam gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **C: Janmau langai la ai**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Hkaw hkam kasha Charles gaw British hkawhkam nta masha ni kaw na shawng nnan jam mau gup lu ai wa rai nga ai"" which translates to ""Prince Charles was the first person from the British royal family to earn a degree.""
"
Trygvasson a hka sanghpaw gaw gara mung kaw na du wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Norway**.

The passage states: ""This formidable force was led by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian with grand ambitions to win back his kingdom from Danish occupation."" This clearly indicates that Trygvasson was from Norway.
"
Labau a galoi ten hta Germany ni Estonia mung a ntsa htunghking hte seng na aja awa ka-up lai wa ai sairai?,"The passage states: ""Tsa ban 15th daram hta, Estonia dingdung gaw Germany a htunghking grai nan ka'up da ai ten re.""

Tsa ban 15th is the 15th century. If we assume ""present day"" is the 21st century, then the 15th century was about 600 years ago.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: Lai wa sai 600 ning laman hta
"
Estonian ga gaw hpa hte ka-up da ai rai?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: German ni a laika kanu**.

The text states: ""Dai hpe German laika kanu kaw na la da ai re ngut nna """"""""Õ/õ"""""""" hpe kahtap bang da ai re."" This translates to ""It was taken from the German alphabet and then """"""""Õ/õ"""""""" was added.""
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Hindi ga shaga ai masha jahpan gaw gara lawnglam hta npawt nna lung dat yu dat re galai shai ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Lama na Hindi ga hte grai bung ai buga ga ni hpe hti shalawm yang**.

The passage states: ""Jauman ga shaga ai masha jahpan ni gaw buga ginra ga ni htep ai hta hkan nna shai mat wa ai."" This directly implies that the number of Hindi speakers varies depending on whether or not closely related regional dialects are included in the count.
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara lam gaw Hindi hte Urdu ga a jaw ai lam rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Shanhte gaw matsun laika nan shai ai** (They have different writing systems).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Hindi hte Urdu gaw ga bungai raitim laika nbung ai"" (Hindi and Urdu are similar languages but have different scripts).

The other options are incorrect because:

*   A: The passage says that speakers can understand each other when speaking, implying communication exists, not that it's broken.
*   C: The passage states that Hindi and Urdu share the same spoken language, but that they do have different writing systems
*   D: Hindi and Urdu share the same spoken language"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw Hangeul laika kanu hte seng nnan jaw ai lam rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Dai hpe yaw shada lam nga nga hte galaw da ai re**.

Here's why:

*   **P: """"""Hangeul gaw mying gumhkawng ai shani shagu jai lang ai hta yaw shada nna gyin shalat da ai laika kanu re.**"" (P: """"""Hangeul is a writing system created with a purpose for everyday easy use."""""" This directly supports that it was created with a specific aim/purpose.

Let's examine the other options:

*   **A: Hkawhkam Sejong up hkang hpang wa ai kaw na dai hpe gin shalat da ai re** (A: It was created after King Sejong came to power.) While true, the passage specifies the years of his reign and the year of creation, but the most accurate answer relates to the PURPOSE of its creation.
*   **B: Laika kanu ni a amying majing gaw Hunan Jeongeum nga ai re** (B: The original name of the writing system is Hunan Jeongeum.) - Incorrect. The passage clearly states the original name is Hunmin Jeongeum, not Hunan Jeongeum.
*   **C: Dai hpe Joseon Prat a mali lang na hkawhkam wa gin shalat da ai re** (C: It was created by the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty.) While true, the most accurate answer relates to the PURPOSE of its creation.

Therefore, option D is the most direct and accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage."
Hunmin Jeongeum laika kanu gaw hpang jahtum hpa baw de gale mat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

The passage states that ""Hangeul laika kanu hpe Hunmin Jeongeum ngu nna mying jaw dat ai"" which means ""The Hangeul alphabet was named Hunmin Jeongeum."" So, Hunmin Jeongeum eventually became known as Hangeul.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara ga ni gaw Sanskirt a shingkang ka-up hkrum ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Latin aga ni** and **D: Kala ga ni**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions Sanskrit being comparable to **Latin** (Option A).
*   The passage explicitly mentions that Sanskrit is a base for many **Kala ga** (Option D).
*   The passage also says that Sanskrit is comparable to Latin ga zawn sha Uropa dan a ga hpan npawt madung re nga ai. So the answer also can be B.
*   The passage says that Sanskrit is an ancient language, implying it is one of **Moi na aga ni** (Option C).

"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Sanskirt hpe jai lang ai lam gaw hpa na majaw mat mat ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Aya nem tsaw madang**.

The passage states: ""Upanishad rau pawng ngut ai hpang kaw na gaw, aya nem tsaw madang hkan ai masa a majaw Sanskrit gaw hkoi mat lai wa ai re."" This directly translates to ""After the Upanishads came together, Sanskrit gradually declined due to the hierarchy system.""
"
Lo ntsa kaw nga ai ginding ningmawng n-gun hte seng nna npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw teng ai ndau laika rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Mungkan ga a ginding ningmawng n-gun gang ai gaw Lo a ginding ningmawng n-gun gang ai hta tinang hpe gang ai gaw grau ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that a person weighs significantly less on the Moon than on Earth.** This is because the Moon's gravity is weaker.
* **Gravity is the force that pulls objects towards each other.**  The stronger the gravity, the more you weigh.
* **Therefore, the Earth's gravity pulls on you more strongly than the Moon's gravity.** This makes you weigh more on Earth.

Option D directly reflects this difference in gravitational pull. The other options contradict this established fact.
"
"Matsing masat laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw shata a shinggan htaphpe teng ai hku tsun da ai kun?","Let's analyze the information in paragraph P and compare it to the options:

*   **Paragraph P**:
    *   The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
    *   The crust is 70 km thick in thin areas and 100 km thick in thick areas.
    *   The crust is thinner under maria (plains) and thicker under highlands (mountains).
    *   More maria are found where the crust is thinner because it's easier for magma to reach the surface through a thinner crust.

*   **Option A: Ni ai kaw na htap gaw grau htat ai (Crust is thicker in thin areas).** This is incorrect. The paragraph states the crust is *thinner* in thin areas (70 km).

*   **Option B: Bumga npu hta ntsa lam na htap gaw grau hpa ai (The crust is thinner under mountains).** This is incorrect. The paragraph states the crust is *thicker* under mountains (highlands).

*   **Option C: Tsan ai shara hkan maria n law ai (There are fewer maria in thick areas).** This is strongly implied and correct. The paragraph says more maria exist where the crust is thinner because it's easier for lava to flow.

*   **Option D: Bumga npu hta maria n law ai (There are fewer maria under mountains).** This is strongly implied and correct. The paragraph says the crust is thicker under mountains and more maria exist where the crust is thinner because it's easier for lava to flow.

The original prompt states there is only one correct answer and options C and D are basically the same. So after reading the provided text, this means the best answer is:

**D: Bumga npu hta maria n law ai**"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, shata a ntsa lam hta gara shara kaw htat dik rai?","The correct answer is **C: Bumga npu hta**.

The passage states: ""Dai ntsa lam gaw ni ai shara kaw gaw 70 km htat nna tsan ai shara kaw nga yang gaw 100 km htat nga ai. Ndai gaw maria npu kaw gaw grau hpa ai re nna **bumga npu de gaw grau nna htat ai re**."" This directly translates to the surface being thinner under maria and thicker under mountains.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara hpe masha nkau mikam ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Asak hkrung ai ni gaw kaga mungkan ni hta nga ai**.

The passage states: ""nkau mi kam ai gaw alak mi shai ai hkrung kanu (sh) kaga sak hkrung ai hpan ni wa kaga mungkan kaw nga ai ngu ai lam ni rai nga ai,"" which translates to ""some believe that uniquely different lifeforms or other living things exist in other worlds.""  This directly supports option C.
"
Jan ka-ang kaw na tinang tsan magang hpa gawhpa magang byin wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Dat nsa**

The text states, ""Dat nsa gaw Jan ka'ang kaw na tsan magang grau hpa wa magang re"" which translates to ""Gas gets more and more thin as it goes further from the center of the Sun.""
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, jan a gara daw hpe mungkan ga kaw nna mu lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Nhtoi shing**

The passage states: ""Jan hpe yu ai shaloi mu lu ai shinggan maga daw hpe gaw nhtoi shing ""photosphere"", nga ma ai."" This directly translates to: ""The outer layer of the sun that we see when we look at it is called the nhtoi shing ""photosphere"".""
"
Copernicus a theory hpe shagrin na matu npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara sawk tam ai lam gaw karum ya ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Venu a rawt jat ai lam ni**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Galileo's observation of Venus's phases (rawt jat ai lam ni) supported Copernicus's heliocentric theory. The phases of Venus, similar to the moon, could only be explained if Venus was orbiting the sun, not the Earth.
*   B is partially correct but A is a more direct correlation. The transit of Venus confirms Venus orbits the sun, but the *phases* of Venus provide more compelling evidence of the heliocentric model.
*   C and D are not related to the support for Copernicus's theory."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw 1610 hta Galileo Galilei mu sagawn ai lam rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Venus a byin yan ni** (Venus's phases).

The passage states directly that Galileo Galilei, in 1610, observed that Venus had phases like the moon.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Amazon Mali hka ni gaw gara hka kaw na mahkawng la ai rai?","The answer is **A: Hka nu kaji ni**

The passage states: ""Hka nu dai gaw hkanu kaji hkying hku law ai kaw na lwi shang wa ai re."" which translates to ""The river flows from thousands of smaller rivers.""
"
Gara shagrau ai lamgaw Amazon Hka nu hte n seng ai kun?,"The correct answer is **C: Galu dik ai hka nu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states Amazon is the *second* longest river.
*   The passage also states Amazon is the *largest* river.
*   The passage mentions the river's volume and contribution to the ocean, indicating it's the river with the *highest discharge*.

Therefore, option C is not true according to the passage."
Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai kaw na gara bungli ni hta Venezulan masha jahpan n law dik rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Hkai lu hkai sha lam**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""kaang hkup gaw hkai lau hkai sha bungli hta galaw ma ai."" ""Kaang hkup"" suggests a very small percentage or fraction of the population.
*   The other options are either described as employing a large portion of the population (karum jaw ai lam), or are specifically mentioned as being a large operation (sau) or not at all (jak rung)."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara bungli ni hta Venezuelan masha jahpan law dik rai?","The passage states: ""Venezuela masha yawng kaw na law malawng gaw lajang ya ai bungli hta galaw ma ai, nkau mi gaw rai ni shapraw ai kaw galaw ma ai ngut nna kaang hkup gaw hkai lau hkai sha bungli hta galaw ma ai."" This translates to: ""Most Venezuelans work in service jobs, some work in manufacturing, and a smaller percentage work in agriculture.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Karum jaw ai lam (Service)**.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, gahkying ai lam gaw shagan ni hpe hpa baw ni galaw na ahkang jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Ninghtoi hte kahtet ai dat ni hpe shapraw ai**.

The passage states that ""hydrogen atom ni gaw grai li ai nhprang jet ni hpe hkrang shapraw na matu rau sha majaw (sh gahkying) mat ai shaloi shagan ni gaw tsam n-gun na majaw nhtoi hte kahtet ai hpe shapru ai."" This directly translates to: ""When hydrogen atoms fuse together to form heavier elements, stars produce light and heat due to the energy.""  Therefore, fusion allows stars to produce light and heat.
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara gaw akyu rawng ai shingja dat kabaw bunghkrawng hku nna galaw shapraw na rai?,"The answer is **A: Hydrogen**.

The passage explicitly states that hydrogen atoms are used in the process that creates the energy in stars. Nuclear fusion, which scientists are trying to replicate in a fusion reactor, involves forcing hydrogen atoms to combine (fuse) together.
"
Hka hpe gara dat ni hte pawng da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Hydrogen atom lahkawng hte oxygen atom langai** (Two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom).

The passage explicitly states: ""Hka gahkyin ai lam hpe hydrogen atom lahkawng a lahta hte oxygen aton langai hte galaw da ai."" which translates to ""Water is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.""
"
"Lama na hka gaw hkrang shai mat ai rai yang, hpa gaw n shai ai sha ngam taw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Molecular hkrang**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Dai gaw dat nsa, ntsin (sh) atawng apa re mat tim de a **molecular gaw da hkrang gaw maren sha re**."" (Even if it's gas, liquid, or solid, its molecular structure remains the same.)
*   The question asks what remains unchanged when water changes state. The passage directly answers that it's the molecular structure.
*   The passage states ""De a **hkum shan hkrang shai mai timung, dat masa hkrang gaw nshai na re**."" (Even though its physical structure changes, the type of element will not change.

Therefore, option A aligns directly with the information presented in the passage."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, nkau tara upadi ni hpe masat yang mare shi masum a matu npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara gaw manghkang nre ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Luttaw hta arawng ayan nga ai**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states the problems**:

    *   The central government was weak.
    *   The upper house was its opponent.
    *   *Luttaw* (Legislative body) had no power to tax and no constitution (meaning *Luttaw* was not considered reputable).
    *   No power to regulate commerce.
    *   Unanimous agreement needed for amendments.
    *   States disregarded the central government.

*   **Analyzing the options:**

    *   **A: Rapdaw up hkang ai ni kaw na yu hparan ai (Checks and balances from upper houses):** The passage states the upper house was an *opponent* of the central government, implying a problem with checks and balances.
    *   **B: Luttaw hta arawng ayan nga ai (Legislative respectability):** The passage mentions *Luttaw* had no power to tax and lacked a constitution, signifying a *lack* of respectability. Therefore, the option that the *Luttaw* has a high reputation is NOT a problem listed in the passage.
    *   **C: Gram lajang ai ni gaw myit hkrum myit ra hte shagrin ai lam ra rawng ai (Amendments require unanimous approval):** The passage directly mentions the difficulty of amendment due to the unanimous consent requirement.
    *   **D: Amyu masha n nga ai magam gun masha (Lack of people):** The passage states that those who don't belong to the state are not able to make laws.

Therefore, only the option that the *Luttaw* had a high reputation is NOT a problem listed in the passage."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara ndau lam gaw galai shai na matu shakut ai majan shaloi rapdaw mung up asuya ni a lam hpe teng ai hku mu mada hkun ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Rapdaw dat kasa ni sa du ai lam n nga ai**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""...dat kasa ni mung jahkring hkring ndu dung lawm ai lam ni nga lai wa sai."" (translated: ""...envoys (from the states to the central government) often did not attend.""). This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lahta rapdaw na arawng aya nga ai ni gaw ahkun jahkrat ya ai:** The passage says the *opposite*: ""...Luttaw kaw ahkun hta matu ahkaw ahkang nnga taw ai..."" (The central government did not have the power to tax).
*   **B: Tara upadi hpe gram lajang ai lam ni gaw lahta rapdaw a arawng aya nga ai ni ntsa shamyet taw nga ai:** While the passage mentions amending the Articles of Confederation, it doesn't say that this process was specifically dependent on the 'Lahta rapdaw na arawng aya nga ai ni'. It states that unanimous agreement from all states was required.
*   **D: Mung up asuya hta dawsang lahkawng lawm ai:** The passage doesn't explicitly discuss whether the government was bicameral. It mostly focuses on the weaknesses of the central government and the issues with state representation and power.

"
Shanglawt lu ai lam ndau shabra laika a hpang hta ga si ni gara hku ka da ai rai?,"The answer is **C: Nhtang hku**.

The passage explicitly states that the writing on the back of the Declaration of Independence is ""nhti nhtang re"", which translates to ""backward"" or ""reversed"". This means it was written in reverse.
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara lam hte Singapore gaw mying gumhkawng ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Mare kaba hte seng ai tsit lali lam**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions Singapore transforming into a ""garden city,"" indicating a focus on urban greenery and landscaping.
*   The passage also mentions Singapore designating Vanda Miss Joaquim, hpan kayau wa madai pan as the national flower.

Therefore, the provided passage clearly indicates Singapore's fame for being a great city with good landscaping."
Vanda Miss Joaquim ngu ai gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Nampan**.

The passage states that ""Vanda Miss Joaquim, hpan kayau wa madai pan hpe mungdan a myu sha nam pan hku lata masat da sai"" which translates to ""Vanda Miss Joaquim, a hybrid orchid, was designated as the national flower of the country.""  Therefore, it is a type of orchid (nampan).
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Giza jut sen lupwa ni a gara marai madang ni hpe New Kingdom ngu ai moi prat na Egypt masha ni mau shakawn ai lam n nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Shanhte na hkrang shadang**.

Here's why:

* **P (Premise):** Explicitly states that the Giza pyramids' *hkrang shadang* (form/grandeur) was never surpassed and that the New Kingdom Egyptians marveled at the *nlung shadaw ni* (stone monuments) of their ancestors.

* **Q (Question):** Asks which aspect of the Giza pyramids the New Kingdom Egyptians *didn't* marvel at, according to the passage.

The passage directly states they marveled at the *hkrang shadang* (form/grandeur), implying this was a key aspect that impressed them. Therefore, the answer to which aspect they *didn't* marvel at must be *hkrang shadang*.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpun lap sha dusat ni gaw marang hpe lu na matu gara shara hkan hkawm sa chye ai kun?","The correct answer is **C: Dingda pa layang**.

The passage states that the wildebeest migrate from the northern highlands across the Mara River to the southern plains (""dingda pa layang"").
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpunlap sha dusat ni gaw April shata laman hkan gara shara kaw na htawt hkawm ai rai?","The passage states that the animals move to the southern plains (dingda pa layang) after crossing the Mara River. The question asks where they move *from* during around April (which is within the timeframe of the rainy season mentioned as the reason for the migration).

The passage explicitly states they cross the Mara River from the northern highlands (dingdung kawng mayan) due to the rains and then proceed to the southern plains (dingda pa layang). So, they are moving *from* the northern highlands to the southern plains, not from the Serengeti, Mara River, or Maasai Mara. Since ""northern highlands"" isn't one of the choices and the question asks where they move *from* during around April. They would be moving to the **B: Dingda pa layang**.
"
Operation Sealion hpyen dap ni gaw gara mungdan hpe htim gasat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Britain**.

The passage states that Germany was preparing to invade Britain with a military operation called Operation Sealion.
"
Germany gaw Britain hpe gasat ai majan hpe gara hku shamying shaga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Operation Sealion**.
"
African mungdan ni hpe aup hkang na Italy ni a masing hta ra ai lahkam langai ngai hku nna n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Egypt hta nga ai sanghpaw ni hpe la kau ya ai (Removing ships in Egypt)**.

The passage states that Italy needed to remove British ships and influence from Egypt as part of their plan to dominate Africa. This directly aligns with answer A. The other options are either not mentioned or are described as general weaknesses rather than specific steps in their plan."
"Matsing masat ga yen hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpa hpe Italy a majan hte seng ai yaw shada ai lam majing re ngu sawn lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Africa dan mung ni hpe aup hkang ai**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states that Italy's successes were in African countries and that they intended to control Africa by transporting many people across the Mediterranean. This makes the colonizing of African countries their main objective. The other options are steps toward achieving this goal."
Shang gasat ai ni hte hku hkau ai lam shawng gawgap la ai gaw kadai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Vichy French**.

The passage states that ""Vichy French ni galaw wa ai. Dai ni gaw shaning 1940 hta German ni hte tsimsa na matu galaw wa ai ni re ngut nna shanhte gaw nginsat ai sha shang wa ai ni hte bungli galaw wa ma ai."" This clearly indicates that the Vichy French collaborated with the Germans.
"
Operation Dragoon kaw lawm ai jinghku ni gaw kadai ni rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Amerika hte Free French ni**.

The text states ""Bat lahkawng laman sha Amerika hte French hpyen dap ni gaw France na dingda maga hpe dang manga kau lu sai...""  This clearly indicates American and Free French forces were involved in Operation Dragoon.
"
Gara hpungtang hpaji rawt jat wa ai lam gaw hka shang sang hpaw ni hka npu de hkawm sa lu shangun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Radar**.

The passage states: ""Majan shawng maga de gaw shanhte ni panglai ntsa hku sha malawng hkrun lam hkawm ai, raitim radar hpe gin shalat hpang wa ai hte grau tup hkrak byin wa ai hte gaw hka shang sanghpaw ni hpe hka kata nmu lu shangun mayu ai majaw lang shaja wa ma ai."" This directly connects the development of radar to the increased use of submarines underwater, as the need to avoid radar detection drove their underwater operations.
"
"Shanhte shawng nna jai lang ai shaloi, gara shara kaw hka npu kaw chye hkawm ai sanghpaw ni hta masat da ai tsan shadang nga ai rai?","The passage states: ""Dai ten ni hta dai ni gaw grai naw lanyan nna tsan de **gap shading** ai lam mung shadawn sharam de naw re.""  This translates to ""At that time, they were still very weak and **shooting** distance was also only moderate.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Gap ai lam (Shooting distance)**.

"Matsing masa hta tsun da ai hte maren, myit hkrum lam hpe kadai tara tawt lai kau ai rai? ","The correct answer is **D: Soviet ni**.

The passage states that the Soviet army, despite non-aggression pacts, invaded Poland. This clearly indicates a violation of agreements by the Soviets.
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw Soviet Hpyen dap hku nna hkrang n shapraw ai lam rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Madung hpyen dap ting hpe bai zinlum na**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes the Polish army's plan to regroup and retreat to Romania to rebuild their forces. This was *their* plan, not an action taken by the Soviet army. The passage details Soviet actions were an invasion from the East.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukarain masha ni a shawng maga galaw ai**: The passage states the Soviet army invaded Belarussian and Ukrainian fronts, so this was an action taken by them.
*   **B: Sinpraw hkran ni hpe shang gasat ai**: The passage says the Soviet army invaded Poland from the East, so this was an action taken by them.
*   **D: Mungdan shada ga shaka hpe tawt lai ai**: The passage states that the Soviets broke several treaties by invading, so this was an action taken by them."
Italy masha ni a nambat shi hpyen dap a jak ninghkring Du daju gaw hpa byin mat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Shi gaw Inglik ni kaw rim hkrum ai**.

"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw Tibet masha ni a tara shim shang ai lam hta ahkyak ai lam rai?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: Yoga hkum shamawt ai lam ni hpe kungkyang hkra shaman ai**

The text explicitly states: ""Tibet masha ni a tara shim shang ai lam madung gaw Yoga hpe tara shim ai lam rai nga ai"" which means ""The main source of Tibetan peace of mind is Yoga as a means of peace."" Further, it discusses Kundalini Yoga, which involves yoga postures and techniques.
"
"""Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Tibet masha ni tara shim shang ai """"ka-ang"""" hta chakras hpe gara hku asak jahkrung ya ai rai?""","The correct answer is **B: Nat hpara ni hpe shingran ai hku**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Ninggun lam yan hku nna nbung ai nat ni hpe mu hkra galaw shakut ai lam ni gaw asan sha re nga nna chakras hpe galaw ai lam hte machye machyang lu wa ai myit ngyan ni hpe hpaw ya wa ai re."" This directly links visualizing spirits with activating the chakras and developing knowledge.
*   The other options relate to other aspects of Kundalini Yoga, but the passage *specifically* connects the activation of chakras with visualizing spirits."
Nanbat lahkawng nawku mahkawn hpe lamang ten kadai mahkawn ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Lakkha Singh**.

The text mentions that ""Lakkha Singh gaw bhajan nawku mahkawn hkawn ai lam hta ningbaw ai lam hpe galaw lai wa sai re"" which translates to ""Lakkha Singh led in singing bhajan devotional songs.""
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, lusha jaw ai ten hta nawku mahkawn hpe kadai mahkawn ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

The passage states: ""Lakkha Singh gaw chhappan bhog bhajan hpe mung hkrang shalat dan lai wa sai."" This means Lakkha Singh performed the Chhappan Bhog bhajan, which is a devotional song associated with the offering of food.
"
Shana daw na nambat hkawng hpang jahtum lang shangwi shapraw ai wa gaw kadai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Anatolia a wan**.

The passage states that ""Shangut shakre na matu, Anatolia a wan ngu mying ai Turkish ka uhpung ni gaw """"""""Troy"""""""" madun dan ai lam hpe hkrang shala lai wa sai re."" This translates to ""To conclude the show, the Turkish dance troupe called Fires of Anatolia presented the """"""""Troy"""""""" performance."" This clearly indicates they were the last performers.
"
Alessandro Sofina gaw hpa amyu rai?,"The passage states ""Italian Alessandro Safina"". Therefore, the answer is **D: Italy masha**.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw n jaw ai rai?","The statement ""Bu hkawm masha ni gaw 90(F) kahtet ai degree kaw lat taw ai majaw shanhte hpe hka bu jaw ma ai."" tells us that:

*   Tourists (Bu hkawm masha ni) were being given water (hka bu jaw ma ai)
*   They were hot because the temperature was 90(F) degrees (90(F) kahtet ai degree kaw lat taw ai majaw)

The statement ""Roller coaster ntsa kaw jawn taw nga ai aten gaw kade mi wa re tim npyaw la nga na re, yawm htum tsun ga nga yang, shawng jawn ai wa yu na matu yawm htum aten hking hkum mi dang na ai re."" tells us that:

*   People were riding a roller coaster (Roller coaster ntsa kaw jawn taw nga ai)
*   It would take at least an hour for the first rider to get off (shawng jawn ai wa yu na matu yawm htum aten hking hkum mi dang na ai re.)

Therefore, based on the provided text:

*   **A: Santa Clara hta wan hkru ai lam byin ai** - The passage mentions Fire Chief Scott Kouns, but it doesn't say anything about a fire happening.
*   **B: Roller coaster ntsa kaw masha ni jawn taw ai** - This is stated in the passage.
*   **C: Bu hkawm ai ni hpe hka jaw ai** - This is stated in the passage.
*   **D: Shawng nnan masha langai hpe shapraw na matu minit 60 yawm htum na ai** - This can be rephrased to: it would take at least one hour (60 minutes) for the first rider to get off.

The only option that is NOT supported by the provided text is A.

**Therefore, the correct answer is A: Santa Clara hta wan hkru ai lam byin ai**
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, kadai gaw nga n pyaw ai kahtet madang a lam hpe tang shawn ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Wan sat ningbaw**.

The passage quotes Wan sat ningbaw Scott Kouns as saying it was a hot day in Santa Clara and that riding a roller coaster in that heat wouldn't be enjoyable.
"
Tsunami a majaw dat n-gun n lu mat ai gaw gara shara rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

The passage states: ""Tonga kaw hpa nhten ai dai nrai ana lu ai mung nnga ai, raitim wan gaw chyhkring hten ai... PTWC kaw na tsunami sadi jaw ai hpe lu la na ai kaw na Tongan mung aup ni hpe pat da ai."" This indicates that while Tonga didn't suffer damage or injuries, their **electricity (wan)** was cut off due to the tsunami.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Tonga gaw dat n-gun n lu ai lam hta gara hku hkra machyi nga ai rai?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: Sadi jaw ai shiga hte seng ai shiga ni hpe mung aup ai ni gaw shiga ni hpe nlu la ma ai** (The passage states that officials in Tonga were blocked from receiving tsunami warnings from the PTWC).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dai hta hten ai lam nkau mi nga ai ngu shiga jaw ai** (The passage explicitly says there was no damage or injuries in Tonga).
*   **B: Sadi jaw ai shiga hte seng na ahkang aya lu ai ni gaw shiga n lu la ma ai** (While related to the problem, the passage specifies *officials* were blocked, not necessarily all authorities).
*   **C: Panglai hka rawt madang hti ai lam hkra machyi ai** (The passage doesn't mention any impact on sea level readings)."
Jonny Reid a mawdaw gau chyang shadang hpe lu shadawn lu na matu pyada ni gaw shanhte a radai sinat hpe galoi lu lang ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shi 160km/h hta gau taw ai ten**.

The passage states: ""...Mr. Reid gaw 160km/h ram shanem ai ten she pyada ni gaw nari gade na ai mai masat ai."" This directly translates to the police only being able to accurately measure his speed when he was traveling *below* 160km/h. Therefore, when he *was* travelling at 160 km/h the police could try to measure his speed.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Jonny Reid a chyang shadang hpe New Zealand pyada ni shadawn na matu hpa majaw yak ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Mawdaw grai nem ai majaw**.

The passage states that ""New Zealand kaw na pyada ni gaw Black Beauty ram ram nem ai majaw shanhte a lawan ai radar sinat ni hpe lang ai hta Mr Reid gade ram sa mat ai hpe mu chye na matu manghkang nga ai."" This directly translates to ""New Zealand police had difficulty using their speed radar guns to measure Mr. Reid's speed because the Black Beauty (the car) was very low.""
"
Butte hte seng ai n-nangnawn gaw gara kaw maju ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Dingda maga deng 40 hta**

The passage states the earthquake occurred ""dingda maga km 65 (deng 40) daram kaw na maju wa ai nnang nawn ai lam re."" which translates to ""approximately 65 km (40 miles) south of Butte.""
"
Kasu kabrawng byin ai laman Abu Ghraib hta hpa byin wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Bawng masha ni hpe zing ri ai**

The passage P clearly states that prisoners at Abu Ghraib were abused during the insurgency. The question Q asks what happened at Abu Ghraib during the insurgency, and the passage directly states abuse occurred. The other options are not directly connected to the question or are not emphasized in the provided text.
"
Iraq hkyuk htawng gaw hpa majaw n kaja ai lam hta gumhkawng wa ai rai? ,"The best answer based on the information in statement P is **B: US hpyen dap ni shara la ai majaw.**

Here's why:

*   Statement P directly links the deterioration of the Abu Ghraib prison to the US military taking control. It states that after the US military took over, the prison became worse because prisoners were abused.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Dai gaw wa nat hkrum ai majaw (Because it was cursed):** This isn't mentioned in the text, so it's incorrect.
*   **C: Kasu kabrawng byin ai lam grai nga ai majaw (Because there was a lot of chaos):** While chaos may have been present during the period, the passage specifically mentions the prisoners being abused and therefore it wasn't just chaos that lead to its decline.
*   **D: Bawng masha ni zing ri hkrum ai lam hpe sawk tam lu ai majaw (Because the abuse of prisoners was investigated):** While investigations might have revealed the abuse, the statement highlights that the abuse *caused* the prison's deterioration."
Maui a Majan Masat dingsat Ginsup pa hta hpa poi galaw hkyen ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Shangwi shapyaw poi**

The passage clearly states ""Dai uhpung gaw masha 9,000 lamang yu mai ai Maui a Majan Masat dingsat Ginsup pa hta **shangwi shapyaw lamang** hpe dawn jay na ai..."" which translates to: ""The group was going to hold a **music festival** at the Maui War Memorial Sports Complex, which can accommodate only 9,000 people...""
"
Poi lamang dawm kau ai hte seng na hpang jahtum hta kadai gaw hpyi nem ai lam bai galaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Shanhte hpe n-gun jaw shawa ni**.

The passage states ""...dai hpang shanhte n-gun jaw shawa ni hpe bai hpyi nem wa ma ai,"" which translates to ""...then they asked the supporters again."" This indicates the supporters were the ones who were asked (or likely, requested) something *after* the event was canceled.
"
Kashun kashe ai lam hte seng nna kadai kaw lit nga ai ngu Bishkek kata hta nga ai masha ni sawn la ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Shawa n-gun madun ai ni (Protesters)**.

The passage states that ""Bishkek hta nga ai masha grai law wa dingda na ninghkap masha ni hpe tara nlang ma ai majaw mara shagun ma ai"" which translates to ""Many people in Bishkek blame the protesters from the south for not following the law."" This directly links the blame for the lawlessness and the events to the protesters.
"
Kashun kashe lam a matu dingda maga na ninghkap masha ni hpe kadai ni mara tam ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Bishkek hta nga ai masha ni**.

The passage states: ""Bishkek hta nga ai masha grai law wa dingda na ninghkap masha ni hpe tara nlang ma ai majaw mara shagun ma ai.""  This translates to: ""Many people in Bishkek blame the people from the south for the lack of law and order.""
"
Ring gaw galoi hta rawt jat wa ai hpe mahkrum madup byin ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shark Tank ngut ai hpang**.

The passage states ""Siminoff tsun ai gaw bungli nnan hpang ai ten gumhpraw sum ai lam madun ai 2013 na shi a Shark Tank langai ngut ai hpang gaw dut kaja wa ai re."" This directly indicates that sales improved after the Shark Tank appearance.
"
Jamie Siminoff gaw galoi hta Ring hpe gaw de hpang sai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shi a seng chyinghka kaw na nsen shangoi ai jak nsen nmai ngoi ai hpe chye ai hpang** (After he realized he couldn't hear the doorbell).

The first sentence of the passage states that Jamie Siminoff started Ring after realizing he couldn't hear the doorbell.
"
Laika hti ai Ngoi Latung a nta shara lamang langai hkrai gaw ma ni hpe hpa the seng nna madi shadaw ai lam jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Laika buk ni** (Books).

The passage states that each episode suggests what types of books children can find when they go to the library.
"
Laika hti ai Ngoi Latung a nta shara lamang langai hkrai gaw ma ni hpe hpa the seng nna madi shadaw ai lam jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **(C) John Grant a ningmu**.

The passage states that John Grant (of Reading Rainbow) said the show encouraged kids to read books. It does not explicitly say Reading Rainbow helped kids with a small amount of funding, Emmy awards, or Mister Roger's neighborhood.
"
Amsterdam hte madun shara a matu lit nga ai ni gaw dai hpun hte seng na npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara ndang hkat ai lam hpe n galaw wa ai rai?,"The passage states that the trees are infected with a dangerous fungal disease, are at risk of falling, and pose a public health risk. This is the basis of the legal dispute.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Dai hpun gaw koi yen nlu sha di hkrat na re (The tree will inevitably fall):** This aligns with the statement that the trees are at risk of falling.

*   **B: Dai hpe mazing da ging ai (It should be preserved):** This option directly contradicts the implied argument for removing the trees due to the dangers they pose.

*   **C: Dai gaw maza ana kap taw ai (It is infected with a fungal disease):** This option correctly identifies a key reason behind the legal dispute.

*   **D: Dai gaw shawa hkam kaja lam hta dingbai dingna nga ai (It poses a risk to public health):** This is also a key reason behind the legal dispute.

The question asks what arguments *weren't* made by the people responsible for Amsterdam and the Anne Frank site. Given the context, the argument they *wouldn't* make is that the tree should be preserved (option B). They are likely arguing the opposite - that it needs to be removed for safety and public health.

Therefore, the best answer is:
**B: Dai hpe mazing da ging ai**
"
"RSPCA a san jep ningbaw tsun ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara a matusan jep ai lam gaw madang dep ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Shan sat rung ni** (Slaughterhouses).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the animal welfare groups are requesting CCTV cameras in *all Australian slaughterhouses*.
*   David O'Shannessy says that inspections need to be standardized *across Australia*. This implies that slaughterhouses are the focus of the need for inspections.
*   The quote ""Shanhte a nam dusat ni hpe tsaw dik ai hku madung da hkrum lu na matu dusat ni hte amu bungli galaw nga ai masha ni a matu CCTV kaw na atsawm sha yu maram lu na re."" directly ties CCTV monitoring to ensuring proper treatment of animals in the context of *those working with animals*. Given the context, this would most logically apply to the slaughterhouses.

While the other options are related (CCTV cameras, people working with animals), the core issue being discussed is the need for *slaughterhouses* to be subject to better and more standardized inspections to improve animal welfare."
"Masting masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Australia shan sat rung hta shan sat ai masha ni dusat ni hpe gawn lajang ai lam a ahkyak ai lam hpe ngang kang hkun ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: CCTV camera ni**.

The passage states that the RSPCA and an animal liberation group are requesting CCTV cameras in Australian slaughterhouses. The reason given is to ensure animal welfare and proper treatment by the people working with the animals. This directly relates to how animals are treated in slaughterhouses.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, rim hkrum ai masha a magam bungli gaw hpa baw rai?","The correct answer is **A: Jawng ma** (Student).

The passage states that the news is spreading that other ""jawng ma ni"" (students) were arrested in connection with the shooting. While Louis Jourdain is the person identified as being arrested, the question asks about the role of the people arrested in general and the passage states that those people were students.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, kaga rim hkrum ai shiga ni shabra taw ai ten hta, tsin yam hkrum ai kade ram a matu makoi mayang hpawng galaw taw ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Masum**.

The passage states: ""Dai ni gaw Jeff Weise hte tsin yam hkrum masha jahku kaw na masum a makoi mayang hpawng..."" which translates to ""Today is the funeral for three out of the nine victims of Jeff Weise...""
"
"Shawa n-gun madun ai ni hpe htai ya ai hku na, gara mungdan gaw ACTA myit hkrum ga shaka laika hte matut nsa ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Poland**.

The passage states that ""Lai wa sai shata hta, Polish mangdan aup ni gaw myit hkrum da ai lam hpe ngalaw ai, ACTA hpe seng htu wa ai hta Poland kaw myit nhkrum masha ni grai law wa ai"" which translates to ""In the past month, Polish authorities reversed the agreement and abandoned ACTA, which resulted in a lot of people disagreeing in Poland."" This indicates Poland withdrew from ACTA. The other options don't state about any country that matut nsa ai rai (not related anymore) with the ACTA.
"
"Matsing masat gayan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai mungdan ni kaw na gara mungdan ni gaw ACTA hte matut mahkai ai lam hpe myit hkrum na matu daw dan sai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Estonia**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Latvia and Slovakia were *behind* in joining ACTA.
*   The passage only mentions ACTA in reference to:
    *   Poland rescinding and causing discontent
    *   Latvia and Slovakia being behind
    *   Estonia along with other countries protest.
*   The passage does not mention anything about Lithuania deciding to agree to ACTA.
*   Scotland is part of the UK, and London is mentioned, but nothing about the UK making a decision to join ACTA."
iPod a kahtet lai ai mabyin a majaw masha kade machyi hkrum ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: 4**

The passage states that ""...kru gaw wan hkru mat nna marai mali a iPod gaw loi li hkru lawm hkrum ma ai."" This translates to ""six caught fire and four people's iPods were slightly burned."" Therefore, 4 people were affected.
"
Kahtet lai ai mabyin gaw hpa n sawng ai ngu na kadai tsun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Apple**.

The passage states that ""METI shana ai gaw Apple kompani ni shanhte tsun ai """"""""nau n-ahkyak ai"""""""" ngu ai kaga kahtet lai ai manghkang 34 byin wa ai nga re."" This translates to ""METI reported that the Apple company said that there were 34 other incidents of overheating that they called """"""""not significant."""""""""" Therefore, Apple considered the incidents of overheating as ""not significant"".
"
"Shi ga shaga ai ten hta, Steve Jobs gaw Apple hku nna hpa hpe bai gin shapraw na re ngu tsun wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Phone**.

The quote says: ""Dai ni na ten Apple gaw phone hpe bai gin shapraw nga ai"" which translates to ""Today Apple is reinventing the phone.""
"
Steve Jobs a hkying hkum lahkawng na ai numhtet ga a yaw shada lam gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Phone nnan ni hpe shabra na matu**.

The passage clearly states that Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone and said, ""Today Apple is going to reinvent the phone, we're starting our history today."" This indicates the purpose of his talk was to launch a new phone.
"
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner gaw Argentine poi yu ginra hta hpa hpe ndau shana wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shi a gumsan magam hte seng ai dat kasa lam**.

The passage states that Kirchner announced in La Plata her decision regarding her candidacy for the presidential election (""mana maga shi a gumsan magam hte seng nna shang shingjawng na share...ndau shana lai wa sai""). This directly translates to her campaign strategy related to the presidential election.
"
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner gaw shi a yaw shada lam ni hpe galaw sa wa na matu gara shara kaw ndau shana ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Buenos Aires hta nga ai La Plata Poi yu ginra hta**

The passage states that Christina Fernandez de Kirchner announced her presidential run share in La Plata, which is 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires. This makes option D the most accurate.
"
Big Brother hte seng na ACMA a sawk tam lu ai lam gaw hpa rai?,"The answer is **A: Jep Jen ai tara gaw tawt lai n hkrum ai**.

The passage states that ACMA found that ""Big Brother"" did not violate any censorship laws because the video was only uploaded to file-sharing sites and not to ""Big Brother's"" official website for public consumption. This directly indicates that no censorship laws were violated.
"
Internet ntsa rawng ai rai hku nna myit na matu shawa matut mahkai ra hta gara masat hkrang nga ra ai rai?,"Based on the provided passage, the correct answer is **B: Dai gaw server langai hta nga taw ra ai**.

The passage states, ""Broadcasting Service Tara upadi gaw Internet lawnglam ni a matu rip kawp tara shapraw da ai, rai timung internet lawnglam ni hpe hkan yu yang dai hpe server kaw nan shakap tawn ra ai."" This directly translates to ""The Broadcasting Service Act has regulations for Internet content, but to comply with those regulations, the content must be hosted on a server.""
"
Australia Liberal Parti a ningbaw gaw kadai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: John Howard**.

The text states, ""...Liberal pati ningbaw langai re ai, awng dang dik ai masha Hkringmang daju Yawhan Howard ni..."" which translates to ""...John Howard, one of the leaders of the Liberal Party, the most successful Prime Minister...""
"
Australia mung hta hpa majaw nuclear jak rung ni n nga shi ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Mung shawa madi shadaw ai lam ra kadawn ai majaw**.

The passage states that Peter Costello (a prominent figure) and John Howard seemingly made sure that Australia's nuclear industry **didn't** get his support. This implies lack of public support (or at least, lack of support from key political figures who likely factored public opinion into their decisions) was a barrier. While the passage also mentions economic feasibility, the *primary* reason, based on the text, is the lack of support.
"
Gara hkyen jawn ai wa gaw lam madun ai wa a karum ningtum ai hte shanglawm shing jawng ai rai?,"Let's analyze the provided text to determine which skier participated with a guide.

The relevant part of the text states: ""Poland mungdan masha, hkyen jawn ai wa Maciej Krezel hte lam woi Anna Ogarzynska gaw shi masum lang hta Super-G hpe shangut kau ai."" This translates to: ""Polish person, skier Maciej Krezel and guide Anna Ogarzynska finished Super-G in thirteenth place.""

This clearly indicates that Maciej Krezel participated with the help of a guide, Anna Ogarzynska.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: Maciej Krezel**
"
Super-G for the women’s standing class hta gara mungdan gaw tsang shi hpe shangut ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Netherlands**.

The passage states: ""Shanhte gaw the Netherlands kaw na mani Super-G hta Anna Jochemsen shara chyhku lu ai."" which translates to ""They are from the Netherlands and in the Super-G, Anna Jochemsen got 8th place."" While the question asks who finished 10th, this option is still the closest to the truth. The question may contain a misunderstanding that the person who created it thought that chyhku means 10 when actually it means 8. The other answers that are listed are all incorrect because the passage states that Kathja Saarinen from Finland finished 10th in a different race, not the Super-G, Mitchell Gourley from Australia finished 11th, and Arly Velasquez from Mexico finished 15th."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Blake hte seng na gara ndau lam gaw shut ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Shi gaw dinglun ai hpe yin la ai**.

The passage explicitly states that Blake ""nyet kau ai re"" (rejected) the assault. Thus, the statement that he admitted to the assault is false.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, npu e jaw da ai hta na gara wa gaw Blake kaw n byin hkra ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Shi hta tara rapra lam hta tara tawt lai ai lam hpe mu lu ai**

Here's why:

* **P (Passage):** States Blake was found guilty of assault.
* **B (He was arrested):** The passage mentions he was arrested at a demonstration.
* **C (He was charged with assault):** The passage clearly states Blake was convicted of assault.
* **D (He was told he would be going to prison):** The passage quotes the judge saying going to prison was ""unavoidable.""

Therefore, because Blake was convicted of assault, it is **incorrect** to say that he wasn't found guilty."
U.N a mungkan du hkra ladaw gahtet wa ai hte seng nna karum gumhpraw ni hpe hpa lam a matu n jai ai rai?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: Rawt jat ai mungdan ni hta ladat hpaji sharin ya ai**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that sharing technology to manage forests, reduce pollution, and promote sustainable development in developing countries is part of the plan. This aligns with sharing technology in developing countries.
*   The passage explicitly mentions needing money for:
    *   Growing seeds (Nam si ni kaba wa na lam)
    *   Efficient water use (hka atsawm jai lang na)
    *   Waterproof houses (hka nshang ai nta ni hpe galaw na matu)

*   The passage aims to help countries address the impacts of global warming (Mungkan du hkra ladaw gahtet wa ai a byin wa na akyu hpe hparan na matu).

Therefore, options A, C, and D are all directly mentioned as needing funds. While B is connected with general plan, the passage is not mentioned for allocating funds in the context of helping with global warming."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, U.N gaw hpa hpe lu hkye la na matu myit mada ai rai?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: Naw ngam taw ai nam maling ni (The remaining forests)**.

The passage clearly states that the goal is to protect the world's remaining forests: ""mungkan a ngam nga ai nam maling ni hpe hkang zing na lam..."" (managing the world's remaining forests). The passage also mentions using technology to help with this and developing countries in an environmentally friendly way. While the passage mentions other benefits like preventing pollution and helping countries affected by climate change, the primary focus is on preserving forests.
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw myit hkrum ai lam naw ra ai lama mi hku nna Albert Muchangan tsun mahta da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Npawt na htung tara ni (Npawt na htung tara ni)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: """"""Ginwang du wa tsun ai gaw """""""" **ritkawp ni hpe anhte myit nhkrum shi ga ai** ..."""""""" This translates to: """"""The regional leader said, "" **We do not yet agree on the rules** ...""""""""

Since ""ritkawp ni"" (rules) in the quote from the regional leader equals the phrase ""Npawt na htung tara ni (Npawt na htung tara ni)"", therefore the answer is C."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, bungli galaw ai hpe July shata hta hpa majaw hpang mai ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Dai hta tara ni hte hkan sa ra ai hkrang nhprang ni alaw ahtam nga ai**.

Here's why:

*   The provided text states ""...anhte kaw nga ai hkrang nhprang gaw 2020 July shata 1 ya shani hta bungli galaw hpang na matu mai nga ai."" This directly implies that the infrastructure is in place to begin operations in July. Therefore, ""B"" is the most accurate answer.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text states Nigeria is preparing to join, but doesn't say July 1st is their target date for joining.
*   **C:** The AU official's statement is related but doesn't directly explain *why* operations can begin in July.
*   **D:** The text mentions disagreement on regulations and tariffs, suggesting they *haven't* agreed."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Atlanta shiga laika npawt nhpang upadi hpung ni gaw hpaji rawng ai ni hpe hpa hte tara soi wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Mu tam tawn da ai kata lam na manghkang ni n hparan ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Atlanta news source published a report showing suspiciously high test scores. They believed the school was aware of problems but didn't properly address them. Option C best describes this situation. The school did not solve the inherent problems that they found.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Shiga laika npawt nhpang upadi a tang madun ai laika jahten hkrum ai**: The passage states the news source made and published a report, not that the report was destroyed.
*   **B: Nam laika hpaji hpe gin shalat ai lam n galaw ai majaw**: The passage does not include any information about not developing literary education.
*   **D: Grai n law ai amat ni hpe tang madun ai**: The passage focuses on the test scores being *too high* in an unrealistic way, not that there were not many results."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta jaw da ai lam hta mahta nna, Atlanta shiga laika npawt nhpang upadi a tang shawn laika hta hpa hpe n tsun da ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Sanpoi laika pa hpe jahten hkrum ai sakse ni** (Evidence of test tampering).

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions suspiciously high test scores and allegations of problems, but it doesn't specifically state that the Atlanta newspaper article presented **evidence** of *actual* test tampering. It focuses on the *suspicion* of problems due to the rapid increase in scores.

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned in the passage:

*   **A: Ayan nre ai sanpoi mahtai rawt jat ai lam** (Unusual test score increases): This is directly addressed in the passage, stating the newspaper pointed out the unlikely rapid rise in scores.
*   **C: 2013 ning na Amyu sha hte seng hpareng ai wa** (The 2013 National of the Year): While the passage mentions a National of the Year award given in 2009, it later refers to 34 educators being implicated in 2013, suggesting a connection to the test cheating scandal.
*   **D: Nam laika hpaji hpe galaw wa ai hte seng na hpaji jaw ai lam** (Information related to teaching literacy): The passage mentions the person did literacy work after receiving awards.

Therefore, the passage discusses everything except evidence of test tampering. So B is the answer."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, bawm kapaw ngut ai hpang hpa shiga ni hpe na lu ai rai?","Based on the text provided, the correct answers are:

*   **A: Hpang jahtum hkra machyi la ai ni a jahpan** (The text mentions a formal report states over 30 people were injured, although the exact number is unknown.)
*   **B: Gara wahpang ni a makau hta bawm kapaw ai** (The text states a bomb exploded near a government building.)
*   **D: Tara shang si hkrum masha** (The text explicitly mentions conflicting reports about police officers killed, but the official report only states the number of injured.)

Therefore, the correct answers are **A, B, and D**."
"2017 ning hta Manchester City hta shang wa ai kaw nna, Jesus kaw poi kade hpe ginsup wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: 24**

The passage states, ""...shingjawng lamang shagu hta kalap mung a matu shingjawng lamang 53 lajang da nna shang ai bawlung htihkum 24 lu lai wa sai re."" This directly translates to ""...he has scored 24 goals...""
"
Gara club hta shang ai majaw Jesus gaw wan £27 lu la ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Manchester City**.

The passage states that Jesus joined Manchester City for £27 million.
"
Gara ndau ai lam gaw manam jarawp kata na manam ni hte seng na n jaw ai lam rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Manam malawng gaw chyoi pra ai mare kaw na re**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""Ndai nta htingtsip gaw hajj pilgrimage kaw na chyoi pra ai mare de nawku na matu du sa ai bu hkawm ai ni hpe nga shara jaw da ai."" This means that the hotel provided lodging to pilgrims visiting the holy city, not that most of the visitors are residents of the city.
*   The passage mentions the pilgrims are on the Hajj Pilgrimage.
*   Most of the tourists are from the United Arab Emirates.

Therefore, the answer **D** is an untrue statement according to the passage."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta ka da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara ndau lam gaw jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Manam ni gaw hajj pilgrimage a matu du sa ma ai**.

Here's why:

*   **P** states: ""Dai nta htingtsip gaw hajj pilgrimage kaw na chyoi pra ai mare de nawku na matu du sa ai bu hkawm ai ni hpe nga shara jaw da ai."" which translates to ""The hotel provided accommodation for travelers who came to worship in the holy city from the Hajj pilgrimage.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dai kaw masha mat ai lam ni n nga ai:** This translates to ""There were no deaths."" **P** states ""Si hkrung si htan hkrum ai gaw yawm dik 15 re"" which translates to ""The death toll is at least 15.""

*   **B: Manam ni yawng gaw United Arab Emirates kaw na du sa ai ni re:** This translates to ""All the guests came from the United Arab Emirates."" **P** states ""Ndai manam jarawp kaw na manam law malawng gaw United Arab Emirates mungdan kaw na masha ni re."" which translates to ""Most of the guests in this hotel were from the United Arab Emirates.""

*   **D: Malawng manam ni gaw Mecca mung masha ni re:** This translates to ""Most of the guests are from Mecca."" **P** states that the hotel provides accommodation for travelers coming to Mecca, implying they are *not* locals."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, adawt ai lam hte seng nna gara shiga gaw n teng ai rai?","The passage states that experts are assessing the *size* of the explosion and how it might impact Earth.  It *doesn't* say that the explosion *benefits* the world.

Therefore, the answer is **C: Adawt ai lam gaw mungkan ga hpe akyu jaw ai** (The explosion is beneficial to the world).
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, adawt ai lam hte seng na hpa ni naw dawdan ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Mayun hpaji daw ai san jep lu ai mahtai ni hpe gara hku bai garan ya na**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Mayun hpaji daw ai san jep lu ai mahtai hpe gaw shawa website hta shana da na re."" This indicates that the method of sharing the findings is a decision that needs to be made (or has been made and is being announced).

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Adaw achyen ni hpe hkan tam na matu kadai lit la na:** The passage mentions that the ""U.S Hpyen Up hkang Dap a United States Lai ladat Matsun Rung"" (United States Space Command) is already monitoring the debris. So, the responsibility is already assigned.
*   **B: Adawt hkrup ai shaloi jak shagan ni kade ram chyang nna hkawm taw nga ai lam:** The passage states the speed and altitude of the satellite at the time of the collision. While more details might be investigated, the passage does not suggest that this is a pending decision.
*   **D: Adawt ai lam hte seng na tup hkrang shadawn shadang:** While determining the exact implications of the collision is important, the passage focuses on the monitoring of debris and the release of information, rather than a specific decision-making process on determining the ""full impact."""
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Batten gaw American na lauban dik jahpan hta lawm ai shaloi gara shara kaw nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: 190th**.

The passage states that Batten was ranked 190th in the 2008 list of the 400 richest Americans.
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara hpe Batten karum ai lam galaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Virginia Dakkasu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions Batten graduated from the engineering and business school at the University of Virginia (Virginia Dakkasu).
*   He was also a major donor to that school.
*   Therefore, Batten helped **Virginia Dakkasu**."

"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, kadai gaw tsun tawn ai lam ni hpe tat kau ai ni rai?","The correct answer is **C: Miller**.

The passage states that when asked for his perspective, Miller said, ""While listening, Mike talked a lot... so I tuned out much of what he was saying."" This clearly indicates that Miller was the one tuning out (ignoring) what someone else (Mike) was saying.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, madat la ai ten hta Miller na mahkrum madup hte seng nna npu e jaw da ai gara gaw jaw ai rai?","Based on the provided text:

P: """"""Duvall, ma lahkawng hte hkumran ai, gaw Miller na matu myit grai ngang lu ai re, dai mawng moi hte seng ai ni a matu. Ningmu jaw na matu san ai shaloi, Miller tsun ai gaw, """"""""Madat la ai ten hta Mike gaw ga grai shaga ai... dai majaw shi hpa ni tsun taw ai hpe ngai atsam nna dat ai.""""""

Which translates to:

P: ""Duvall, combined with his two children, was very distracting to Miller for the old-timers. When asked for his opinion, Miller said, ""Mike talks a lot during listening... so I tuned out what he was saying.""""

The key information here is that Miller found Mike's (presumably Duvall's child) talking distracting during listening.

Now let's evaluate the options:

*   A: Duvall was very annoying to Miller during the listening hours - This is incorrect because it was Mike, Duvall's son, who was annoying.
*   B: He was unable to concentrate during his presentation - This is incorrect. The text mentions difficulties concentrating during listening.
*   C: Duvall's two children were talking a lot during listening - This is correct. Miller explicitly says ""Mike talks a lot during listening"" and Mike is associated with Duvall as one of his children.
*   D: He was focused on the funny stories Duvall was telling - This is incorrect. He was tuning Duvall's son out.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C**.
"
"""""""Nbung jasan ai magam bungli” hpe bai gram na matu kadai gaw hpaji jaw ai rai?""","The correct answer is **C: Jack Layton**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Stephen Harper (Hkringmang daju) and Jack Layton (NDP ningbaw) met. It then says that Layton asked for changes to the gumhpraw hpyi chyarang related to mungding myu tsaw myit rawng ai ni a grupyin masa, asking for a ""azin ayang hkum hkum tsup tsup"" rewrite. The passage mentions Harper agreed to send out the ""nbung jasan ai magam bungli"" (air cleaning program) to party committees for review. So, Layton's request is directly linked to potential changes or adjustments to a program.
"
"""“Nbung jasan ai magam bungli"""" gaw ra lata poi ndu shi ai ten masha ni myit lawm hkra galaw lam re nguhpe kadai ninghkap ai rai?""","Based on the provided text, the answer is **D: Gin jaw asuya hte seng ai MP**.

The text states: ""Tasmania, mungdaw asuya hte kaga federal hkring mang daju nkau mi gaw ndai hku galaw ai hpe shataman shi langai hta galaw na federal ra lata lamang a ningshawng kumla langai hku na shawa myit shang sha hkra dingsang galaw ai lam langai re ngu nna mara tam shagun ma ai.""

This translates to something along the lines of: ""The Tasmanian state government and some other federal cabinet ministers accused this (the action being discussed) as a public relations exercise, as a first sign of a federal election program.""

Thus, it is the state government (mungdaw asuya), implied federal cabinet ministers, and therefore MPs from the governing party, who are criticizing it as a public relations exercise to gain popularity before elections.
"
Cyanuric e sit hte melamine gumhpawn gaw nyau jit hta shan lahkawng shada dat hkra hkat yang hpa hkrang byin pru wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Shagan hkyi lung sha ni**

The passage states: ""Lanyau jit hta e melamine hte cyanuric e sit pawng nna byin wa ai shau si ni hpe sawk sagawn ai ni maram mu ai."" This directly translates to researchers discovering crystals formed by the combination of melamine and cyanuric acid in cat kidneys. The following sentence then identifies those crystals as starburst-shaped.
"
Infrared spectroscopy hpe sawk tam ninghkrin ni hpa na sawk tam na matu lang ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Dusat ni a jit hta shagan hkyi lung sha ni gayau ai lam**.

The passage clearly states that researchers used Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to compare the composition of the crystals found in cat urine to known compounds found in pet food. This helps them understand the nature and composition of those crystals (shagan hkyi lung sha ni) in the animals' urine (dusat ni a jit hta).
"
"""Luna hpe kadai gaw """"Alat ningshawng hkawmhkam shayi” ngu na tsun ai rai?""","The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The passage states, ""Tommy Dreamer tsun lai wa ai gaw, """"""""Luna gaw alat ningshawng hkawmhkam shayi re."""""""" which translates to ""Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was a pioneer queen.'""
"
"""Kadai gaw Luna hpe """"freaky"""" ngu tsun ai rai?""","The correct answer is **B: Dustin Runnel ni**.

The passage states: ""Dustin """"""""Goldust"""""""" Runnels ka da ai gaw """"""""Luna gaw ngai zawn sha masha hte nau nbung ai… ngai hta grau yang grau na…"". While the word ""freaky"" isn't explicitly used, the phrase ""masha hte nau nbung ai… ngai hta grau yang grau na…"" conveys a similar meaning, suggesting Luna was unconventional or unusual, even more so than Dustin Runnels himself.
"
Dai adawt ai hta mawdaw gau lawm ai wa hta n byin hkrum ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shi gaw baw kaw ningma lu mat ai** (He suffered a head injury).

The passage states, ""mawdaw gawt ai wa chyawm gaw baw hta tsang ra ai ningma lu mat ai,"" which translates to ""the driver, on the other hand, sustained a serious head injury.""
"
Rugbi ginsup ai shingjawng poi laman Dingda Africa a ginsup ai ladat hte seng nna hpa gaw laklai ai lam n re ai rai?,"The passage highlights the following strengths of the South African rugby team:

*   **B: bawlung hpe jum lang ai hpaji (skill in handling the ball)**
*   **D: Makawp maga ginsup atsam ni (Defensive skills)**

Option C: Shingjawng poi nnan hpang ten na grai hkrak ai shangwi shapyaw lamang (Excellent performance at the beginning of the competition) is not mentioned as a distinctive characteristic or strategy of the South African team in the provided passage.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Shingjawng poi nnan hpang ten na grai hkrak ai shangwi shapyaw lamang**."
"Matsing masat gayan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Dingda Afrika a ginsup poi gaw gara ten hta rawt jat wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Shingjawng poi matut galaw taw ai shaloi**

The passage says: ""Dingda Afrika ni gaw shingjawng poi hta gau ngwi ngwi awng dang mat ai"" which translates to ""South Africans gradually succeeded in the tournament/competition"". This indicates their success happened during the course of the competition.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun ga ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw Miwa mung a sut masa lam hte seng na n jaw ai ndau lam rai?","The correct answer is **D: Miwa ni gaw Germany ni hta grau nna mawdaw n lu shapraw ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""lai wa sai shaning hta Miwa gaw Germany hta grau nna mawdaw ni hpe maigan de shapraw ya ai lam galaw lai wa nna"" (Last year, China exported more cars than Germany).  Option D directly contradicts this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Gram lajang ai ni galaw ngut ai hpang Miwa ni a sut masa gaw grai rawt jat wa ai** (After the reforms, China's economy grew significantly) - The passage explicitly mentions Deng Xiaoping's reforms leading to economic growth.
* **B: Miwa ni na mawdaw shapraw dut ai gat lawk gaw United States hta grau kaba ai** (China's car export market is larger than the United States') - The passage states China has overtaken the United States as the largest market for car exports.
* **C: Miwa ni gaw hpang jahtum hta United State ni hta na grau kaba ai GDP hpe lu mat ai** (China may eventually have a larger GDP than the United States) - The passage mentions that China's GDP may exceed the United States' within ten years.

Therefore, only option D presents an inaccurate statement based on the provided passage.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Miwa mung a GDP gaw United States ni hta galoi ten lai kau da sai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Shi ning ladaw lahkawng laman** because the passage states: ""Shaning hkun ning daram hta Miwa a GDP gaw United States na hta grau law wa chye ai re,"" which translates to ""In about a decade, China's GDP might be greater than that of the United States."" A decade is equal to ten years which is the same as two five-year periods (shi ning ladaw lahkawng)."
Rawt jat ai mungdan ni galaw ai hpa hpe Hu gaw hpaji jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shanhte a rawt jat lam madang hpe kanawng ya ai lam hpe lit la u**.

Here's why:

* **Hu's Argument:** Hu's statement emphasizes that developing countries should prioritize economic development according to their capabilities and resources. He argues against imposing burdens (like drastic carbon emission cuts) that exceed their economic capacity. He suggests that pollution control should come *after* economic growth.
* **Option A Aligns:** Option A directly reflects Hu's idea that developing countries should only commit to obligations that align with their development stage. They should take responsibility for managing growth, not hindering it with unrealistic demands.
* **Other Options:**
    * B: ""Hpaga hta arang bang ai lam hpe maju jung u"" is a possible action but not the key argument of Hu.
    * C: ""Shanhte a ya na bungli ni hta jan nna galaw sa u"" suggests taking on more than their current capacity, which is the opposite of Hu's point.
    * D: ""N kaja ai lam dingsa ni hpe koi u"" is a possible action, but again not the key argument of Hu.
"
Hu n tang madun ai gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Di la ai lam ni a npawt madung (The sources of the difficulties)**

Here's why:

*   The passage focuses on Hu's statements about China's efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. He argues that they will work to reduce emissions per unit of GDP, but emphasizes that they shouldn't be burdened with obligations that exceed their capabilities or economic situation. This highlights the underlying difficulties and limitations they face in achieving ambitious emission reduction targets. The passage implicitly discusses the sources of these difficulties.
*   The other options are not directly supported by the passage:

    *   **B: N kaja ai nbung hte seng na rawt jat ai mungdan ni hpe hpaji jaw ai lam (Advising growing countries concerning polluted air):** While Hu mentions the order of priorities for developing countries, it's not the core focus.
    *   **C: Carbon htuk shapraw ai hpe shayawm lu na ngu myit mada ai shani (The day carbon emissions will be reduced):** The passage does not give the specific date.
    *   **D: Carbon htuk shapraw yawm mat ai a hkrang sumla (A model for reduced carbon emissions):** The passage describes intentions and principles, but not a concrete model."
Lawu e jaw da ai kaw na gara hpe masa n kaja ai re ngu Veerman tsun wa sai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

The passage states: ""Medecines Sans Frontiere Richrad Veerman a shiga dap kaw na masha tsun ai gaw, Angola gaw njaw ai hpe galaw taw ai ngut nna dai lam ni gaw Angola kaw nkaja ai lam hpe matut byin shagun taw ai, ngu shi tsun ai."" This directly translates to Veerman saying Angola is doing things wrong and that these actions are continuing to cause bad things in Angola.
"
"Tara soi ai lam a majaw, Huhne a Hkringmang shara hta kadai bai shara la na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Davey**.

The passage states that ""Huhne gaw pru mat sai rai nna hkringmang hpung na shi shara kaw MP Ed Davey hpe galai bang na re,"" which translates to ""Huhne is leaving and MP Ed Davey will replace him in his position in the cabinet.""
"
Tara gang ai ten hta kadai hpe hpaga hte seng ai hkringmang hku na myit la na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Lamb**.

The passage states that ""Hkringmang Daju Norman Lamb hpe sut masa hkringmang bungli a matu myit mada da nna Davey gaw bungli kaw na pru ya wa na re"" which translates to ""Chief Minister Norman Lamb is expected to the financial minister and Davey will leave the job."" Thus, Norman Lamb is expected to be the financial minister.
"
Camille Saint-Saen ni a gamung lanya hta shangwi shapyaw ai ni gaw poi yu masha ni hpe hpa galaw na matu n-gun jaw ai rai?,"Based on the prompt:

*   The passage states the performance aims to portray someone who ""expresses their life through drugs and love for Japan.""
*   It also mentions the performers aim to make the audience feel deeply after taking drugs.

Given this, the most accurate answer is:

**A: Cannabis nanghpam htunghpyi hpe lu sha hkun ai** (To use cannabis drugs tradition)

The passage implies the performers are encouraging the audience to experience a state of mind similar to the character in the performance, achieved through drugs."
Yungwi kamung hta kadai ni gaw nanghpam hka yawm hpe madung lu ai rai?,"The text states that the ""hkrang shala dan ai ni"" (those who brought the story to life, i.e., the performers) received the ""nanghpan lu dan ai"" (benefit of being addicted). Thus, the answer is **C: Hkrang shala dan ai ni**.
"
"""Leonov hkrang shala mat ai """"lamu hpungtang kaw langai hkrai hkawm sa ai"""" a kaga mying gaw hpa rai?""","The correct answer is **C: EVA lamang**.

The passage states: ""1965 ning na Wut shata 18 ya shani hta shi a shawng jahtum """"""""EVA"""""""" lamang shing nrai, lamu hpungtang kaw langai hkrai hkawm sa ai lam hpe minit shi lahkawng jan hkra galaw lai wa sai."" This directly equates ""EVA lamang"" with ""lamu hpungtang kaw langai hkrai hkawm sa ai"" (space walk).
"
Lenovo gaw gara lit lamang na Soviet daw hpe woi awn wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**.

The passage states: ""Shi ning na ai hpang, she gaw Apollo-Soyuz lit la lamang na Soviet daw hpe masat dingsat let Lamu ganghkau Gashun ai lam htum sai ngu woi awn mat ai."" This translates to ""After his retirement, he led the Soviet part of the Apollo-Soyuz mission, marking the end of the Space Race.""
"
Dai adawt ai lam hta kadai kala nba hkrum ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Gibson**.

The passage states that Gibson was injured in the accident and taken to the hospital, where he later died.
"
Dai mabyin hta lawm ai masha ni hpa byin mat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Langai gaw hpa nhkra la ai, langai gaw si mat ai** (One was uninjured, one died).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Gibson died after being taken to the hospital.
*   The passage states that the driver of the other vehicle was uninjured (""mawdaw adawt ai kaw kala nba nhkrum sha lai wa ai"" - ""did not experience any injuries in the collision"").
"
Program hte bungli galaw ai hpungtang hpaji ninghkrin ni gaw npu e jaw da ai lam ni kaw nna byin pru wa na gara akyu jaw ai lam hpe mu tam na matu myit mada taw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Dark matter**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that scientists are hoping to learn about how dark matter interacts with itself, similar to how regular matter does. It is mentioned in the sentence: ""Hpaji rawng ni gaw dark matter gaw laga dark matter ni galaw ai zawn galaw ai ngu chyhtum hta tsun wa ai."" (The passage says in the end that scientists think dark matter behaves like regular matter.)
"
Hpungtang hpaji ninghkrin ni gaw npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara mabyin hpe sawk tam wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Sagittarius galaxy hte Milky Way**.

The passage explicitly states that the search for the underlying cause is due to the interaction between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter. Sagittarius is being described as a small galaxy.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, hpa baw hpe mung ding htung hkan ai ni n mai ding lun ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Bai gawgap ai lam hta jai ai gumhpraw** (The money spent on rebuilding).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the disagreement stemmed from ""gumhpraw jai na n jai na"" (whether or not to spend money) on relief and rebuilding efforts following Hurricane Katrina.  This directly corresponds to option D.
* The text implies that people should respect the rebuilding agreement, so disagreement regarding the money spent for rebuilding is the most likely option that traditionalists (the ""mung ding htung hkan ai ni"") would not accept.
The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Asak hkye ai lam hta lang ai gumhpraw (Money used for life-saving efforts):** The text does not mention disagreement about the money used for saving lives. The disagreements center around rebuilding, not initial life-saving measures.
*   **B: Bai gawgap ai lam n nga ai lam (The fact that there is no rebuilding):** The text discusses *how* to rebuild, not *whether* to rebuild.
*   **C: Kadai gaw bai gawgap na ga shaka ni hpe shagrau hkrum ai lam (Who should be honored for the rebuilding agreement):** The passage mentions honoring the agreement but doesn't suggest disagreement about *who* should be honored. The core issue is the *financial* aspect of rebuilding."
Katrina a hurricane na asak hkye ai bungli ni a matu bai gawgap ai ga shaka ni hte seng na kadai dinglun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Washington kata na ni**.

The passage states that the rebuilding efforts and ambitious debates aimed to honor the rebuilding agreement so Washington residents could understand. This implies that people within Washington were involved in the debate and discussions surrounding the rebuilding agreement.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Stardust ganghkau li kaw nna ninghtoi ni hpe gara shara hta shawng nnan mu lu na rai?","The text states: ""Jawhpawt hkying 5 (sinpraw ahkying) ram hta, Dingdung California, Oregon, Nevada, hte Utah ni a masha uhpung ni a matu gaw nhtoi kaji mi htoi taw na hpe myit mada ai."" This means people in Northern California, Oregon, Nevada, and Utah are expected to see a small light.

The question asks where the lights from the Stardust capsule would be seen *first*. The next part of the text, """"""Dai gaw dingda Kalifornia a sinna panglai de htawt mat na re ngut nna lamu kaw na jan gaw Kalifornia kaw na ka-ang Oregon du hkra ngut na Nevada hte Idaho, dai hpang Utah du hkra htoi tu na re,"""""", describes a *path*. Therefore, from the first sentence, *Northern California* is listed as the first place the light is expected to be seen.

So the answer is B.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara a matu ganghkau li gaw matsing masat na rai?","The correct answer is **C: Mungkan ga de grai lawan ai hku bai wa na** (Returning to Earth very quickly).

The passage emphasizes the speed of the Stardust capsule's return to Earth, stating it's the fastest object to re-enter the atmosphere, surpassing the Apollo X mission.
"
Dr. Malar Balasubramanian gaw Saroja Balasubramanian hte gara hku matut manoi lam nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Kanu** (Mother).

The passage states that Dr. Malar Balasubramanian's mother, Saroja Balasubramanian, was found dead in the trunk of a car. Therefore, Saroja is Malar's mother.
"
Sara Balasubramanian a hkum sawp hpe gara kaw mu tam la ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Gunrai htaw mawdaw kata hta**.

The passage states that Saroja Balasubramanian's body was found in the trunk of a car.
"
eBay gaw hpa tam mahkyu la lu ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

The passage explicitly states that eBay acquired Skype.
"
eBay gaw tam mahkyu ai lam hte seng nna awngdang lam lu na matu hpa hpe tam taw ai rai?,"The best answer is **B: Lamu ga nnan de maden wa na (To expand into new territories)**.

The passage states that eBay is thinking of diversifying and expanding into areas where Skype is growing, such as China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil. This directly indicates an intent to expand into new territories.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Shi a shang gumhpraw hpe shangang shakang na (To stabilize its revenue)**: While expanding into new markets *could* help stabilize revenue, the passage focuses on *where* they are expanding, not *why* in terms of revenue stability.
*   **C: Shi a labau hpe shatsaw jat na (To improve its history)**: The passage mentions that this is potentially the biggest search opportunity in eBay's history, but the *purpose* is expansion, not solely improving their past.
*   **D: Shi a gambum madu ni hpe myitdik shangun na (To satisfy its shareholders)**: Expanding into new markets might please shareholders, but the passage does not directly state that pleasing shareholders is the primary motivation. The text focuses on the *action* of expansion, making B the best fit.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, gasat poi hta ngam taw ai bawng masha ni hte kadai gaw hku hkau lam n galaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Bawngban jahkrup ai ni**.

The passage states that the negotiators tried to resolve the situation, but ""bawng masha ni a hpyi shawn ai lam ni gaw a san sha n-dan dawng nga ai"" which translates to ""the demands of the prisoners were unclear"". This implies a lack of constructive dialogue or agreement, meaning the negotiators were not successful in forming a good relationship with the prisoners. The other options were directly involved in suppressing the prisoners, not in trying to negotiate with them."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara lam gaw hpang jahtum hta kasu kabrawng byin ai lam kaw na asum jaw na matu byin hkun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: myiprwi pru hkun ai dat nsa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that police entered the area with protective gear and used tear gas to disperse the protestors. The tear gas directly caused the crowd to disperse, making it the most direct factor in ending the disturbance.
* The passage also mentions the fire being put out but that isn't directly related to the protests being disrupted by the police.
"
"Ayatollah Ali Khamenei a ningmu hta, Iran mungdan gaw gara kaw nashanglawt lu gying ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Sau hta shamyet machyu ai** (Depending on oil)

The passage states Ayatollah Ali Khamenei considers dependence on oil a ""trap"" and that the entire nation must be freed from this trap. Therefore, the nation needs to be free from oil dependence.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Iran amyu hpaga hte seng na galaw ahkang pat shingdang ai lam a akyu ni hpe kadai tsun pru wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Dai pawt dai hpang ni**.

The passage states: ""TV ntsa live madun ai hta myit ningmu (sh) dinglun ai lam ni kaw na ding tawng shapoi ai ni gaw Iran amyu hte seng ai dai pawt dai hpang ni hku nna galaw ahkang pat shingdang da ai lam ni gaw akyu lama ma nga taw ai ngu nna shawng nnan tsun pru wa ai re."" This translates to: ""Those speaking out or arguing on live TV were the first to say that the restrictions on Iran's economy by those powers had some benefit.""
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw France me jaw ai ladat hte n seng ai rai?,"The answer is **C: Me jaw na matu ta masat ka ai**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes the process of putting pre-printed ballots into envelopes and then into a ballot box. There's no mention of voters marking or writing on the ballots themselves.
*   The other options are mentioned in the text:
    *   A: ""Mu lu ai me pung ni"" - The text mentions easily accessible ballot boxes.
    *   B: ""Kasa ni sa dat ai dat kasa ni"" - Candidates can send representatives to observe the process.
    *   D: ""Me ni hpe shang shingjawng ai ni a dat kasa ni hku na hti ai"" - The text says that volunteers count the votes in the evening under supervision and that candidates can send representatives.

Therefore, option C is the only one that doesn't fit with the description of the French voting process."
Me jaw ai ni gaw shanhte a lata shingjawng masha kasa ni hpe gara shara hta madun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Laika sumbu ntsa** (On the ballot box).

The passage clearly states that voters put ballots with their chosen candidate's name into the ballot box.
"
Hpa gaw Allen hpe Musahi a matu matsat ning sawk tam na lam hpang wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Panglai hte seng na sawk tam ai lam hta shi a arang bang ai lam**.

The passage states: ""Mungkan a sutsu dik htum ai masha ni kaw na langai rai nga ai Allen gaw shi a sutgan ni hpe panglai hte seng ai tam sagawn amu hta arang bang da nna, Musashi sanghpaw a majan pa na prat hpe tam sawk yu ai lam hpe hpang wa nu ai."" This directly translates to Allen, being one of the richest people in the world, invested his wealth in marine exploration, and thus started looking for the Musashi battleship.  Therefore, his investment in marine exploration is the reason he began the search. While A is related, it is his use of wealth *for marine exploration* that is key.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Allen gaw shi na gumhpraw grai law hpe gara kaw jai lang ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Panglai hte seng ai sawk tam lam**.

The passage explicitly states that Allen, one of the world's wealthiest people, ""arang bang da nna, Musashi sanghpaw a majan pa na prat hpe tam sawk yu ai lam hpe hpang wa nu ai"" which translates to ""dedicates his wealth to marine exploration, starting with researching the history of the Musashi battleship.""  This falls under the broader category of ""panglai hte seng ai sawk tam lam"" which translates to ""marine exploration.""
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw jak rung kata hte makau grup yin hkan dingbai dingna byin hkun chye ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Radio dat shapraw ya ai sau wan sau**

Here's why:

* **The passage directly links the possibility of contamination to ""radio dat shapraw ya ai sau ni hpe bang tawn ai ndum gaw mai kapaw ga ai hte kayun nga ai lam,""** implying that these oils are the source of the problem and could cause harm within the factory and its surroundings. The passage mentions that support groups believe these oils are causing the issues.

The other options are mentioned in the passage, but not directly linked to the *cause* of the potential contamination in this specific situation:

*   **Radioactive caesium and Iodine:** These are mentioned in the context of the Japanese nuclear disaster, suggesting a general concern about these substances, but not explicitly tied to the factory incident described in the passage.
*   **Wan hkut ahpraw:** While smoke might be a symptom of something dangerous, the passage emphasizes the potential leak or spread of radioactive oils as the primary cause for concern.
"
Jak rung kata mabyin byin ngut ai hpang mung lawu kaw na gara gaw mung shawa ni hpe jaw ai shimlam hte seng ai hpaji jaw ai lam nre ai rai?,"The passage describes a situation where a fire broke out, potentially releasing radioactive materials. Local authorities are advising residents to:

*   Stay indoors
*   Avoid using air conditioners (to prevent circulating potentially contaminated air)
*   Avoid drinking unfiltered water

The question asks which of the listed actions is **NOT** part of the safety advice given to the public after the incident.

Let's analyze the options:

*   A: Nbung katsi jaw ai jak ni hpe lang ai lam hpe koi u (Avoid using air conditioners) - This **IS** part of the advice.
*   B: Kata kaw nga ai (Stay indoors) - This **IS** part of the advice.
*   C: Wan hkut ahpraw hpe marawp ai lam koi u (Avoid being around red/glowing embers) - While a fire is mentioned, the advice focuses on radiation safety. There is **NO** specific mention of avoiding embers.
*   D: Hka pai kaw na hka lu ai hpe koi u (Avoid drinking tap water) - This is related to the advice to avoid drinking unsafe water. So this **IS** part of the advice (i.e., avoid unfiltered water)

Therefore, the correct answer is **C**. The passage doesn't explicitly mention avoiding red/glowing embers.
"
"Dr. Moll tsun ai hte maren, XDR-TB hte seng na hpa hpe myit tsang dik rai?","The correct answer is **C: Ana lu ai masha langai kaw na ana bai shabra luai masha jahpan**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Shaning la a aten hta, ana nga ai masha langai gaw shi hte ni ai masha 10 kaw na 15 daram ana kap chye ai."" (During the rainy season, one infected person can infect about 10 to 15 people who are close to them.) This indicates that Dr. Moll is concerned about how easily the disease can spread from one person to another.
*   The other options are not the main concern that Dr. Moll expressed in the passage:
    *   **A:** While the passage mentions that some patients may have contracted the disease in the hospital, it doesn't say that this is his biggest concern.
    *   **B:** The passage doesn't focus on the ability of XDR-TB to resist treatment but focuses on its spread
    *   **D:** The passage doesn't explicitly say that Dr. Moll is primarily concerned with the mortality rate (although it is undoubtedly a serious aspect)."
Shai ai amyu nnan hte matut ai kaw na machyi masha kade gaw hkam kaja lam hte seng ai bungli galaw masha ngu masat la ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**

The passage states: ""yawm htum marai lahkawng gaw tsirung kaw bungli galaw ai ni re,"" which translates to ""at least two were workers at the hospital."" Since the question asks how many healthcare workers were infected due to the new strain, the answer is 2.
"
Nexgen ladat gaw gara zawn re ai hpungtang hpaji hpe lang da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Jak shagan hpe npawt da ai hpungtang hpaji** (Star-based technology).

The text states that NextGen uses ""jak shagan hte seng ai lai ladat hpe lang nna"" (star-based technology) to control air traffic and provide more accurate information to pilots.
"
Nexgen gaw nbung lamu ntsa nbungli htinglet ai lam hta gara hku akyu nga ai rai?,"Based on the passage provided (P), the correct answers are:

*   **C: Carbon shapraw ai hpe shayawm ya na (Reduce carbon emissions)** - The passage explicitly states that NextGen aims to ""jahkring ai hte ka-bun shapraw ai hpe jahkring ai hte shaning shagu jak sau ga-lan wan hku shayawm lu na re ai lam ndau ai."" (stop and reduce carbon emissions and save millions of gallons of fuel annually).

*   **D: Wansau yawm wa na (Reduce fuel consumption)** - This is directly linked to reducing carbon emissions, as the passage mentions ""jak sau ga-lan wan hku shayawm lu na re ai lam ndau ai"" (save millions of gallons of fuel).

While the passage mentions ""grau nna jaw hkrak ai hku nbungli gau ai ni hpe shiga jaw lu na matu rai nga ai"" (more accurate information for pilots), this doesn't directly translate to ""grau jaw ai pyenli ni a shara ni"" (more accurate locations of planes) as a primary benefit of NextGen in the context of the question about congestion.

""Grau kadun ai pyen lam ni"" (Shorter flight paths) is not directly stated.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, FBI maju jung da ai lam hpe labau gawn ai ni kadai mung n dinglun ai gaw hpa baw rai?","The correct answer is **C: Masha kaba masai marai re ai hte seng ai mabyin ni hpe grau maju jung ai** (Focusing more on serious major case incidents).

Here's why:

* **Paragraph P** states that the FBI was criticized for focusing on less serious crimes (like car theft) and emphasizing agents' success rates.  It then mentions that the law required them to focus on financial crimes and the FBI created a special team to investigate the 10 largest most serious cases.

* **Question Q** asks what everyone (presumably including historians) would agree the FBI focused on.

* **Option C** directly aligns with the shift in focus described in Paragraph P: the FBI was now specially focused on the *largest, most serious cases*, implying a previous lack of such focus.
"
Masha kaba masai marai re ai hte seng ai lam ni byin wa ai gaw FBI hpe hpa ni shadut nna galaw hkun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Aloi sha hparan lu ai amu ni hta maju jung ya ai**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that law enforcement officials criticize the FBI for focusing on less important cases like car theft and aiming for higher success rates for agents. This suggests that they are focusing on easily solvable crimes.
*   The passage indicates that the FBI was ordered to look into larger scale cases of corruption, specifically about a 2005 law that dealt with misused funds.
*   This means, before this directive to find the most corrupt of the corrupt, the FBI was involved in focusing on easily solvable cases."
JAS 39C Gripen di hkrat ai hta htang jaw ai wan mawdaw gaw hpa baw byin mat ai rai? ,"The correct answer is **C: Dai gaw kapaw mat ai**.

The passage states the plane crashed and ""kapaw ga mat ai"" which translates to ""exploded"".
"
"JAS 39C Gripen di hkrat ai hta hkan nna, pyenli pa gaw hpa ni hte matut manoi ngalaw na matupat kau ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Hpaga pyenli ni (Commercial planes)**.

The passage states the plane crashed near a commercial plane runway. This implies potential interaction and thus a reason for investigation and closure. The other options are less directly linked to the immediate crash site.
"
Iran amyu sha ni a rawt malan hkrun lam hta Brzezinski gaw kadai hpe makawp maga kam jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter**.

The passage states that Brzezinski was Carter's foreign policy advisor during the 1976 election and later served as the National Security Advisor (NSA) under Carter from 1977 to 1981. The passage also mentions that Brzezinski assisted Carter with issues like the 1979 Iranian Revolution.
"
1977 du hkra Amyu sha Shim lam hte seng ai Hpaji jaw ai Hpung hpe kadai jum da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Kissinger**.

The passage states: ""NSA zawn shi gaw Carter hpe Mungkan bungli magam ni hpe sumtsan kasa lam hku na jum lang ai lam..."". This means that he fulfilled the role of NSA just like Kissinger had done before him. And we know that Brzezinski served in the NSA from 1977, so before that, it was Kissinger.
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw Partizan Belgrade hte Bobek a kanbau bungli hte seng na teng ai ginhtang lam n nga ai rai?,"The answer is **A: Shi gaw shi a hpung a matu ginsup ya ai shaloi goal 468 jan hkra lu ai**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states Bobek scored **403 goals in 468 appearances** for Partizan Belgrade.
*   Option A says he scored *more than* 468 goals, which is false.
*   The other options are all true based on the information provided:
    *   B: Shi gaw kaga ginsup ninghkrin hta grau na goal lu ai (He scored more goals than other players for the club)
    *   C: Shi gaw shi a hpung hta byin dik ai ginsup ninghkrin ngu na labau hta kalang mi nga ga ai (He was once named the greatest player in the club's history)
    *   D: Shi gaw kaga ginsup ninghkrin ni hta na grau ginsup wa ai (He played more games than other players)"
Gara lam gaw Partizan Belgrade hte Bobek a labau hte seng nna jaw ai lam re ai kun?,"The correct answer is **A: 1945 hta shi gaw Partizan ni a matu ginsup hpang wa ai** (He started playing for Partizan in 1945).

The passage states: ""Shi gaw shanhte hte 1945 hta ta gin dun nna 1958 du hkra rau nga lai wa sai."" which directly translates to ""He joined them in 1945 and stayed with them until 1958.""  Therefore, he began playing for Partizan in 1945.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Velociraptor hte Hesperonychus a nbung ai kumla ni gaw hpa rai?","The passage states:

*   Hesperonychus is related to Velociraptor (""Velociraptor amyu ni hte gaw hpu nau ni rai ma ai"").
*   Hesperonychus walked on two legs (""Velociraptor zawn lamyin tu ai lagaw lahkawng hte lam chye hkawm ai dut sat..."").

Therefore, the shared characteristic explicitly mentioned is having two legs (lamyin tu ai lagaw lahkawng).

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Shi kaw lagaw lahkawng nga ai (Shi kaw lamyin tu ai lagaw lahkawng nga ai)** - This is directly supported by the text.
*   **B: Shi kaw grai gaba ai nambat lahkawng lamyin nga ai (Shi kaw grai kaba ai nambat lahkawng lamyin nga ai)** - While Hesperonychus is mentioned to have a large toe claw, it is not said that the velociraptor has a large toe claw.
*   **C: Hkum ting amun tu ai** - While the passage states that Hesperonychus is assumed to be a feathered dinosaur, the passage does not provide information on whether Velociraptors have feathers.
*   **D: Shi gaw sai lum ai amyu re** - While likely given that they are related to birds, the passage does not state the Hesperonychus and Velociraptor are warm blooded.

Therefore, the answer is **A: Shi kaw lagaw lahkawng nga ai.**"
Hesperonychus a lachyum gaw amyu baw hpan akumhkrang hte seng ai gara kumla kaw na yu hkrat wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Lagaw ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shi a laga lamin gaw grai kaba ai, sinna lamin ngu lachyum rawng ai Hesperonychus hte galu gaba wa ai."" This translates to ""Its claw was very large, and Hesperonychus, meaning western claw, was named after it.""  Therefore, the name *Hesperonychus* is derived from a characteristic of its *lagaw ni* (feet/claws).
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw sanat gap ai hte seng nna jaw ai rai?,"Let's analyze the text to determine which statement is true based on the provided information:

*   **A: Madu wa hte madu jan lahkawng yen gaw Texas na re:** The passage states they got married in Texas last year but came to Buffalo to celebrate with friends and family. This doesn't mean *both* are from Texas. The husband is from Buffalo.

*   **B: Dai hta hkalem hkrum ai marai manga nga ai:** The passage mentions the husband being a victim in an incident involving gun violence. The number of victims is not explicitly stated.

*   **C: Buffalo hta shawng shaning shaloi shan hkungran ma ai:** They got married in Texas last year and came to Buffalo to celebrate their one-year anniversary.

*   **D: Gap gasat ai lam gaw Buffalo hta byin ai:** The husband, a Buffalo native, was a victim of gun violence.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Gap gasat ai lam gaw Buffalo hta byin ai**.
"
Gara ndau ai lam gaw gap gasat byin ai lamang hte seng nna jaw ai rai?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Buffalo hta galaw ai laning mi ladu hkrum poi hta byin ai**.

The passage states that the couple traveled to Buffalo to celebrate their one-year anniversary with friends and family. It is reasonable to infer that the reported incident happened at this celebration. The text does not indicate that the incident happened at their Texas wedding."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Luno hte seng na lit nga ai ni hta shawng nnan nga ai myit tsang lam gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **C: Wansau kayun ai**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""shawng shaloi e masha kaba ni gaw sanghpaw na wansau manu mana hkaw wa na hpe hkrit tsang ma ai"" which translates to ""initially, the adults were afraid of the theft of valuable fuel from the ship."" This clearly indicates a primary concern about fuel being stolen.
"
"Matsing masta ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Luno jak hten ai hte seng nna lawu kaw na gara gaw n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Rai ni hpe tau hkrau n hta shi yang jak hten ai lam byin ai (The crash happened before the materials were even loaded.)**

Here's why:

*   The original passage states that the ship was on its way *to* pick up cargo when the incident happened. This means the materials were not on board *before* the event.

The other options are supported by the text:

*   **B: Sanghpaw jak hten ai ten hta wansau meter 100 ram lawm ai (There was about 100 meters of oil on the ship when it crashed):** The passage says the ship contained 120-160 cubic meters of oil.
*   **C: Bungli galaw ai malawm shi lahkawng hta na, marai langai sha machyi hkrum ai (Out of the twelve crew members, only one was injured):** The passage mentions ""Ji grawng pyenli ni hte magam gun jahku hpe hkyen lu ai, hkala hkrum ai gaw ladi daw ai langai sha re,"" meaning all but one crew member escaped.
*   **D: Sanghpaw gaw hkaleng shinggang de kanawng hkrum ai (The ship collided with an underwater object):** The passage states ""dai hpe hka leng shinggang ganawng wa yang."""
Gara shaning hta Algeria gaw shang lawt lu ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: 1960 hta**.

The passage states: ""Shaning 1960 hta shi gaw shanglawt sai Algeria hpe sumla hkrung gayet ai lam hpe sharin na matu bai galaw wa ai."" (In 1960, he returned to teach filmmaking in independent Algeria.)
"
Makoi mayang hpawng a matu gara shara hkan e televisio pat ni hpe n madun ya ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: St. Peter a ginwang**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the event is happening in St. Peter's Square.
*   The passage also says that in Rome, **away** from the square, there are screens set up.
*   The passage states that in Italy towns, Poland towns are using screens.
*   Since there are too many people in St. Peter's Square, screens would not be needed here."
Makoi mayang hpawng hpe gara shara hta galaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: St. Peter Square**

The passage states that Masha went to Rome to attend the funeral of the Pope and that the funeral was held in St. Peter's Square.
"
"Kapaw ai lam ngut ai hpang, kadai gaw grai sawng ai ana a matu tsi tsi ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Yawm htum masha manga**.

The passage states that ""yawm htum dai kapaw ai aten hta dai shara kaw nga ai masha manga ni gaw kajawng ai ana kumla a majaw tsi tsi lajang hkrum ma ai,"" which translates to ""at least five people who were in the area at the time of the explosion received medical treatment for symptoms of shock.""
"
Gas gayun ai lam hpe kadai shiga jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Gas hpaga company a tara shang masha** (Gas hpaga company a arawng aya lu ai wa).

The passage states that ""Dat nsa hpaga hpung na arawng aya lu ai wa gaw makau grupyin na masha langai dat nsa mawng hkrat ai lam hpe tsun shana ai hpang ndai mabyin hpe sumtang madun wa ai.""  This translates to ""An official from the gas company reported the incident after a neighbor reported a gas leak.""
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, gasat ai lam hta masha kade tsi hkrum ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: 4**

Here's why:

The passage mentions:

*   **Kristoffer Schneider** - received facial treatment.
*   **Edgar Veguilla** - received arm and shoulder injuries.
*   **Nicholas Alden** - Age 25
*   **Zachary Cuddeback** - Age 21

So, the passage discusses injuries sustained by 2 people - Edgar Veguilla and Kristoffer Schneider - and 2 other people, Nicholas Alden and Zachary Cuddeback who were involved. That makes a total of 4 people."
Gasat ai ten hta kadai na laknak gaw gap na matu n awngdang ai rai?,"The passage states: ""Uka a laknak gaw manga masha a baw hpe madi da ai shaloi nkaja mat ai re."" This translates to ""Uka's weapon did not fail when it supported the head of the five people."" Therefore, Uka's weapon did *not* fail.

The question asks whose weapon was *not* successful at firing. The passage does not mention anything about Cuddeback, Schneider, or Alden having weapons.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Uka** because his weapon *did* work.
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na Olympic lamang n re ai gara ginsup hpan gaw me jaw hkrum ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Squash**.

The passage states that rugby and golf have been added to the Olympic program. It also mentions that baseball, softball, karate, and another fighting sport were competing to be included in the Olympics. Squash is not mentioned as being part of the Olympic program or competing for inclusion.
"
Npu e jaw tawn da ai kaw na gara ginsup hpan ni hpe ginsup poi hta bang na matu Olympic hpung ni me jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Rugbi munghpawn**

The passage states ""Rapbi, grau nna gaw Rapbi munghpawm hte goft ni hpe laga n-gun ginsup hpan manga hta grau nna Olympic kaw lu lawm hkra myit ya na matu lata tawn da sai re."" This translates to ""Rugby, especially the Rugby union, and golf have been selected to be considered for inclusion in the Olympics among the five other sports.""

While the passage mentions the other sports, it specifically states that Rugby Union (and Golf) are the ones chosen to be considered for inclusion.
"
Arthur Guinness gaw St James' Gate Brewery hta shaning kade shap nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: 9000**.

The passage states that Arthur Guinness signed a 9,000-year lease for St James' Gate Brewery.
"
Guinness gaw laning mi hta dollar wan kade ram la shang wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is not directly available in the options, but it is closer to option C.

Here's the breakdown:

The passage states Guinness makes over €10 billion (US$14.7 billion) annually. Option C is the closest match to this amount, written as 14. 

Although none of the options are written using the word ""billion,"" we must assume that the 14 is in reference to 14 billion. The same can be implied for the ""10"" in option D. In this case, 14 (billion) is the closest and therefore the correct answer.
"
Eropa Munghpawm kata na mungdan kade hta H5N1 ana hpe mu tam ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Seven**.

The passage states: ""France gaw Eropa Munghpawm na mungdan sanit ai shara hta ndai ana kap bra hkrum ai mungdan re; ngam ai ni gaw Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece hte Italy ni re."" This directly says France is the seventh EU country, and lists six others, for a total of seven.
"
H5N1 ana hpe hpang jahtum gara shara hta mu tam ai rai?,"The passage states that H5N1 was recently found in a marshland near Lyon, in eastern France.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: France**.
"
Simsa lam hpe mazing ai masha ni a majaw byin ai ana nchyam bra shi yang Haiti a ana hte hpang jahtum hkrum ai gaw galoi rai?,"The correct answer is **A: 1800 ning hkan**.

The passage states: ""Hpyen uhpung ni madung du wa ai shaloi, Haiti gaw ana ahkya hte seng ai mayak manghkang ni nhkrum hkra ai gaw 1800 ning kaw na rai sai."" This directly answers the question of when Haiti last experienced a cholera outbreak before the peacekeepers arrived.
"
Gara shara kaw na maza a majaw ana zinli chyam bra wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: UN hpyen dap**.

The passage states that the UN peacekeeping forces who arrived after the 2010 earthquake are accused of causing the cholera outbreak because of a disease spread from near their camp. While the Artibonite River was contaminated (A), it was the UN forces who are implicated in the contamination. The other options are not directly linked to the source of the cholera outbreak in the provided text.
"
Irish mung up hkang ai ni gaw hpa galaw na masing nga ai rai?,"Based on the provided text, the Irish government is considering amending the law to address the situation regarding substance abuse. The government spokesperson stated that it is important to enact legislation as soon as possible to address both public health and legal aspects of the issue. The Minister of Health is concerned about following through on harm reduction regarding narcotics without legal changes, and is anxious about a pilot scheme to include short-term decriminalization for drug users to help them participate in rehabilitation.

Considering these points, the best answer is:

**C: Nanghpam jai lang mai ai hte seng ai tara upadi ni hpe shayawm kau ai** (loosely translates to: Relaxing laws regarding drug use).

The text suggests a move towards decriminalization for drug users in specific, controlled circumstances (short-term, part of rehabilitation), implying a relaxation of current laws. While the other options might be elements of a broader strategy, they are not the primary focus indicated in the text.
"
Ireland hta hpa gaw tara shang galaw mai ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Nanghpam lusha ai**.

The passage mentions that the Health Minister is worried about following the current regulations regarding narcotics and is concerned about how to help those who take narcotics in a short-term legal way through programs that support their inclusion in society. This implies that **nanghpam lusha ai** could potentially become legal or be treated differently under the law.
"
Tara tawt lai ai masha ngu nsen ai wa hpe hpa na matu san jep ai lam galaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Mara galaw ai**.

The passage states that Christopher Garcia is investigating the man for ""mara kaba galaw ai"" (committing a serious crime). ""Mara galaw ai"" directly translates to ""committing a crime.""
"
"Kumla galai ai ten, mara galaw ai ngu shadu ai masha gaw hpa n galaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Dai kaw na laika langai hpe galai kau ai** (Replaced a letter from it).

The passage states that the symbol was altered by replacing the ""O"" with a lowercase ""e"" to spell something different. This is essentially changing a letter.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw English tutor Karno hpe mara n shagun ai rai?","The passage states that Karno was accused of copyright infringement but NOT charged. The other options were explicitly mentioned as reasons for criticism:

*   **A: Madu ahkang hpe tawt lai ai (Copyright infringement):** The passage states he was accused of this but not charged.
*   **C: Ahkaw ahkang n nga aindau laika ni hpe dip shapraw ai (Distributing advertisements without permission):** The passage explicitly mentions he was fined for this.
*   **D: Jawng gawk kata hta n kaja ai ga tsun ai (Speaking rudely in the classroom):** A former student mentioned that they used harsh language in the classroom.

While option B might be indirectly implied due to the mention of inappropriate interactions with students, it is not explicitly stated as a formal accusation in the text. Also, the question asks which charge was NOT levied against Karno.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Madu ahkang hpe tawt lai ai** because he was accused of copyright infringement, but not charged."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Rolando Mendoza a bawng malai hku na n shaga la hkrum ai gaw kadai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Sumla gayet ai ni**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Hpang daw de sumla gayet sara ni gaw shi namdum ra ai majaw asak kaba sai num ni a shara hpe la kau nu ai."" This means that the photographers were replaced to accommodate Mendoza's needs. They were not held hostage.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara bawng malai ni hpe jau nna dat ya ra ai nga ai hpe n shagrin shi ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Ma kaji ni** (Ma kaji ni hte sakkung ni lawm ai bawng malai marai kru, jau dat kau hkrum ai ni gaw Fillipine amyu masha sumla dem ai ni re. which means ""Six hostages including children and priests were released, who were Filippino taking photos.)

The passage states that children and priests were among the hostages released, who were all Filipinos taking photos. While the passage mentions the elderly women were moved aside, it doesn't say that they were released initially. The passage doesn't mention that the tourists were initially released. And the passage doesn't mention that the people taking photos were released first.
"
"Masting masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Brazil hta la shada da hkrungran ai lam hpe tara shang byin hkra madi shadaw ai ta masat hkan hta ai wa gaw kadai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Shawa n-gun madun ai ni (Masha N-gun madun ninghkap hpung ni)**.

The passage states that ""Masha N-gun madun ninghkap hpung ni gaw masha wan 1.2 laimak htu tawn ai shawk shawn laika ni hpe kahkyin la nna shata man shi langai kaw myu sha upadi ka rapdaw de tang shawn lu na matu myit mada nga ai,"" which means public advocacy groups are collecting signatures to present a bill to the national congress in support of same-sex marriage.
"
Shawa n-gun madun ai ni gaw kadai hpe mai hpyi shawn na rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Brazil a Myu sha Rapdaw** (Brazil's National Congress).

The passage states that the public demonstration groups are collecting signatures to present to the national legislative congress in one and a half months. This indicates that they are petitioning the National Congress.
"
"Armand Versace a jahpan hte maren, masha uhpung ni duhkra lagaw hte ginhtang ai lam nhpang shi ai shaloi hpa baw gaw adik tawk hku nna byin nga ai rai?","Based on the provided text, the closest answer is:

*   **C: Dai kaw nbung laru kaba ni nga ai (There were strong winds there)**

The text mentions: ""Hkrang madun taw ai minit manga na ai shaloi na yi hkum mi 70km shachyang shadang hte nbung bung hpang wa ai"" which translates to ""Five minutes into the show, wind started blowing at a speed of 70km per hour."" This indicates strong winds were present before other events unfolded.
"
"Versace tsun ai hte maren, laru kaba gaw galoi hpang wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Madun poi hpang ai kade nna ai ten hta**.

The text states: ""Hkrang madun taw ai minit manga na ai shaloi na yi hkum mi 70km shachyang shadang hte nbung bung hpang wa ai. Dai hpang marang htu hpang wa ai..."" This translates to ""About five minutes into the performance, the wind started blowing at 70km per hour. Then the rain started..."" So the storm began relatively shortly after the performance began.
"
"Fred na ten n rai shi yang, 35°W sinpraw maga hta nbung laru kaba kade nga wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Lahkawng**.

The passage states that Fred is the *third* strongest storm on record east of 35°W. This implies that there have been two other storms stronger than it in that region.
"
"Cape Verde zunlawng kaw Fred nga ai shaloi, dai gaw gara matsun madun ai lam de sa taw ai rai?","Based on the provided text, ""Fred gaw hkying hkum mi hta ya yang deng 105 (165 km/h) nbung nga ai, dai gaw sinna dingdung maga shamu taw ai.""  This translates to ""Fred is moving at 105 miles per hour (165 km/h), and it is moving towards the **northwest**.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Dingdung sinna (Northwest)**.
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw myi shawng na chyang shadang hta grau lawan ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The passage states that ""802.11n a chyang shadang gaw shi hta shawng pru ai... grau lawan ai hpe mu lu ai,"" meaning that 802.11n is faster than its predecessors.
"
802.11n gaw 802.11b hte mahkri shawn lu na matu hpa baw ra ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Radio marun**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states that 802.11n's compatibility with older standards (like 802.11b) is due to it operating on both 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz frequencies.** This ensures it can communicate with devices using older 2.4 GHz technology (like 802.11b).

*   **Radio marun** refers to the use of multiple radio frequencies, and 802.11n uses two, 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz, as well.

Therefore, radio marun is the characteristic of 802.11n that allows it to be compatible with 802.11b."
Commonwealth Games hta Olympic ja dazik lu ninghkrin ni hku nna poi lamang kade a matu hka hpung yawt ra ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Masum** (Three).

The passage states the athlete intended to participate in ""ginlen shingjawng poi masum"" (three individual events).
"
Hpa majaw Olympic ja dazik ninghkrin gaw shi a machyi ai ana hpe tsi mawan lajang ai lam n galaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Dai hpe Commonwealth Games hta ahkang n jaw da ai**.

The passage states that he couldn't take medicine to recover from his illness because it was banned from use at the Commonwealth Games. This directly answers why he didn't treat his illness.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, n-nangnawn nawn ai lam hte seng nna hpa gaw myit shuk ai lam byin hkun ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Sum mwi chyang ni**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Alak mi re ai nnang nawn shamu ai byin yan shai wa ai mahtai gaw wan bum pungding matu na sinpraw dingdung maga hta shata man matsum 10 ya kaw byin hpang wa sai. Sum moi chyang ni gaw wan bum a majaw byin wa ai nre ngu hpe bum lagaw hpe yu nna masha ni tsun shana ma ai. Sum mwi ni gaw kaja wa wan bum kapaw wa na n kapaw na lam byin wa mai masa hpe tang madun ai re.""
*   This directly links the ""sum mwi chyang ni"" (steam vents or gas emissions) to the potential for a volcanic eruption, which is the source of the concern about seismic activity."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta hkan nna, byin yan madang ni galai shai ai lam galoi byin wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: March 10 ya hta**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Alak mi re ai nnang nawn shamu ai byin yan shai wa ai mahtai gaw wan bum pungding matu na sinpraw dingdung maga hta shata man matsum 10 ya kaw byin hpang wa sai.""

This translates to: ""The unusual seismic activity and deformation difference started to occur on March 10th at the northeast side of the volcano's peak.""

Here's why:

*   The passage states the Moon Impact Probe (MIP) ""successfully crash-landed"" on the moon. This means the impact and ""landing"" (although a crash landing) was successful.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **A: Dai gaw shata a dingdung maga de hkring ai:** While the passage mentions the probe landed near the lunar north pole, this is a detail of *where* it landed, not a description of a successful scientific study and/or the key finding.
*   **C: Dai gaw masha hkang ai mungkan shinggrup hpungtang li kaw na gumlawt pru wa sai:** The passage explicitly states that the orbiter (Chandrayaan-1) released the MIP. While related to the launch, this point doesn't focus on a concrete finding/result.
*   **D: Dai gaw ahkyak ai arai lahkawng hpe htaw tawn da ai:** The passage says that the probe used ""three on-board instruments.""

Therefore, option B, which highlights the successful completion of the MIP's mission, is the best answer because it is talking about something completed."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, gara ana makawp maga ai masing hpe hpang jahtum galaw na rai?","The correct answer is **C: Bawnu hte seng ai makawp maga tsi ni** (Encephalitis vaccine).

The passage explicitly states: ""Encephalitis (Bawnu hta byin ai ana ahkya) hpe makawp maga ai tsi bu kaji hpe asuya hku nna bu wan law law lu na matu ga sadi jaw da sai..."" which translates to ""The government has promised to provide many doses of encephalitis vaccine."" This clearly indicates that encephalitis vaccines are the focus of the upcoming program.
"
Ana zinli gaw masha ni kaw gara hku kap wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Wa ni**.

The passage states: ""Dai ana ahkya gaw wa ni gun wa ai rai nna jigrawng ni kaw na masha ni kaw kalang bai kap wa ai re."" (The disease is carried by bats and then spreads from pigs to people.)
"
Lahkawng lang na ari dam jahkrat masat ai lam hkrat sum ai majawkaning re ai mahtai hpe pru hkun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Gindai bung ai hpung hpe shawng lam hta gawde lu na ahkang (Opening the door for future civil rights)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the failure of the second law prohibiting same-sex marriage ""could open the door for future civil rights advances.""  This directly corresponds to the idea of ""opening the door for future civil rights"" or ""Gindai bung ai hpung hpe shawng lam hta gawde lu na ahkang"".

Let's look at the other options:

* **A: HJR-3 hpe kalang ta san jep ai (Quick questioning of HJR-3)**: While HJR-3 is mentioned, the passage says it will be *revisited* in the future, not immediately questioned after the first two laws failed.
* **C: Hkyak hkyak upadi zup hpawng (Emergency legislative assembly)**: The passage doesn't imply an emergency situation or special assembly.
* **D: Gindai bung ai hpung ni hpe hkum shadang ai lam (Blocking the equal groups)**: The entire passage suggests the opposite, that a legal barrier has been removed, potentially leading to more equality."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun dai ai hte maren, lahkawng lang na ari dam jahkrat masat ai lamhpe galoi shaprai kau ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: 2011 ning hta**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Rapdaw nta lahkawng yan gaw yaw shada ai garam lajang ai lam ni hpe **shaning 2011 kaw shagrin da lai wa sai re**."" This translates to ""Both houses of the legislature had already established their differences in 2011."" Therefore, the differing or amending process was established in 2011.
"
"""""""Panama Laika pa ni gaw"""" kadai ni kaw chyam bra mat ai rai?""","The correct answer is **C: Deutsche Gumhpraw Dum**.

The passage states: ""British shi laika The Guardian gaw Deutsche Gumhpraw dum gaw ndai hpe awngdang da ga ai kawp sha nga ai kompani 1200 a htam masum na htam mi hpe jum tek da ai nga na shiga shapru da sai."" This indicates that Deutsche Gumhpraw Dum was heavily involved with the companies exposed in the Panama Papers.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, British shiga dap hku nna aja tsun ai lusu ai hpe makoi magap lai wa sai hpaga hpung law malawng hpe hparan taw ai wa gaw kadai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Deutsche Gumhpraw Dum**.

The text says ""British shi laika The Guardian gaw Deutsche Gumhpraw dum gaw ndai hpe awngdang da ga ai kawp sha nga ai kompani 1200 a htam masum na htam mi hpe jum tek da ai nga na shiga shapru da sai.""  This means The Guardian reported that Deutsche Bank handled a significant portion of the offshore companies mentioned in the Panama Papers.
"
Npu e jaw tawn da ai nbungli di hkrat ai lam ni hta gara wa gaw si sum ai lam grau law ai rai?,"The passage states that the plane crash going to Armenia killed 168 people. The crash in Mashhad killed 17 people. The passage doesn't specify the number of deaths in other crashes. Therefore, the answer is **A: Iran kaw na Armenia lam kaw nbungli di hkrat ai**.
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara gaw Iran hta byin ai nbungli di hkrat ai shoihpa law malawng a madi madun ai lam nre ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Nbungli nnan mari na matu gumhpraw n nga ai** (There is no money to buy new airplanes).

Here's why:

*   **A: Shawa hte hpyen dap na nbungli dingsa ni** (Old public and military aircraft): The passage explicitly states that the planes are old.

*   **C: Nbungli nnan mari ai lam hpe pat shingdang ai lam ni** (Restrictions on buying new airplanes): The passage mentions sanctions preventing the purchase of new planes.

*   **D: Hkangreng ai lam nhkrak ai nbungli ni** (Poorly maintained airplanes): The passage implies this by saying the old planes lack sufficient maintenance.

*   **B: Nbungli nnan mari na matu gumhpraw n nga ai** (There is no money to buy new airplanes): The passage mentions restrictions on buying new planes due to sanctions, not necessarily a lack of money.

Therefore, the passage highlights old planes, sanctions, and lack of maintenance as contributing factors, but it doesn't specifically state that the core problem is a lack of funds to purchase new planes. The problem is access to new planes, not necessarily the money to buy them."
Npu e jaw da ai hta na Iraq Sawk Tam Hpung a sumtang laika hta nlawm ai rai?,"The answer is **D: US hte myit hkrum lam la ai hpyi shawn ai lam**.

The passage states the Iraq Study Group's report *opposes* competition with the United States' policy in the Middle East. This means they *don't* call for agreements with the US; they are against competing with US policies.

The other options are clearly mentioned in the passage:

*   **A: Ya na policy hpe dinglun ai** - The report challenges current policies.
*   **B: Galai shai ai lam nkau mi lawm ai ndau shana laika hte, Iraq kata na dawsa ai lam ni hpe koi gam lu ai** - The report is important for changes needed in Iraq.
*   **C: Iraq lamu ga jarit hpe makawp maga na matu hpaji jaw ai lam ni** - The report prioritizes protecting Iraq's borders.
"
Iraq Sawk tam hpung a sumtang laika hta npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara hpe hpaji n jaw da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Hkrang hkrang re nna dangrang hkat ai lam hpe jai lang na**.

The passage does not mention using force or aggression to resolve conflicts. It focuses on diplomatic solutions, border security, and rebuilding relationships. The other options are mentioned in the text as concerns or proposed actions.
"
"Hpyen la ni tsun ai hte maren, Provenzano a hkra lata masha gaw kadai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

The passage states: ""Pya da ni tsun ai gaw Lo Piccolo kaw ntsa lata nga ai hpamajaw nga yang shi kaw Palermo kaw Provenzano's right-hand man nga ai..."" which translates to ""Police say that Lo Piccolo, being on top, he was Provenzano's right-hand man in Palermo..."".
"
"Matsing masa gayan hta jaw da ai lam ni hta mahta nna, Falcone a si hkrum ai lam gaw hpa majaw rai?","The correct answer is **A: Shi gaw Riina-driven majan laman hta sat hkrum ai**

The text states: ""1992 ning hta Mafia a nhkru ai Falkone hte Paolo Borsellino ni a asak hkrat sum shangun ai Riina majan ngut mat ai hpang..."" which translates to ""After the Riina war that caused the death of Falkone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992...""

Therefore, Falcone's death was a result of the Riina war.
"

*   **D: Judo ninghkrin** (Judo expert)
*   **B: Japan Judo ginjaw yawng a tingyang up** (Chairman of Japan Judo Federation training committee)

A isn't valid because Hitoshi Saito only wins the world championship one time.
"
Iwasaki gaw gara shara kaw ga sadi ni hpe tawt lai lu mat ai rai?,"Based on the passage, Iwasaki was captured in Kala after escaping from a festival in Nepal.  Therefore, the answer is **C: Kala mung**.
"
Iwasaki hpe kadai gasat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Gwi langai**.

The passage mentions that ""gwi mana langai gaw Tibet kaw wa htim gawa wa ai"" which translates to ""a wild bear attacked him in Tibet"". Therefore, a bear (gwi) attacked Iwasaki.
"
Alonson gaw shi a mawdaw shing jawng lam hpe galoi jahkring kau ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Shawng de woi awn ai shara hpe nlu la shi yang**.

The passage states that Alonso had to retire after a pit stop due to damage, but it doesn't mention when specifically he retired in relation to Schumacher. It does, however, explicitly state that Alonso was leading for most of the race until his pit stop forced him to retire.
"
Schumacher gaw shi a shingjawng poi hpe jau shangut kau ra ai hpa majaw rai?,"The text doesn't explicitly state why Schumacher had to finish the race early. However, it mentions that there were ""many retirements"" in the race, implying mechanical issues or crashes were common. It also states that Schumacher took the lead *after* Alonso retired due to damage to his car.

None of the options are explicitly stated in the text. However, let's analyze:

*   **A: Shi gaw shi a mawdaw hpe n dang hkang mat ai (He lost control of his car)**: This could be a possible reason for retirement, fitting the context of a race with many retirements.

*   **B: Alonso hte adawt hkrup ai (He collided with Alonso)**: The text implies Alonso retired *before* Schumacher took the lead, making a collision unlikely as the reason for Schumacher's retirement.

*   **C: Fisichella a majaw dingsen hten mat ai (Damage caused by Fisichella)**: The text only says Fisichella retired due to losing control of his car. There's no mention of him causing damage that led to Schumacher's retirement.

*   **D: Mawdaw jahkring ai ladat hten mat ai (Brake failure)**: This is also a possibility, fitting the context of a race with many retirements.

Considering that we have to choose an answer and that many retirements happened in the race, the best possible answer given the information available is:

**A: Shi gaw shi a mawdaw hpe n dang hkang mat ai (He lost control of his car)**

While it could also be a brake failure, losing control is a more general explanation that aligns with the high number of retirements during the race.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, rim hkrum ai ni a matu kadai ni gaw pahkam hkam ya ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Ginjaw kaw na madi shadaw ai wa (Central booking madi shadaw hpung kaw na shalawt ya ai lam hkrum lai wa sai re)**.

The passage states that over 80 people detained in the last 3 months were released *without* paying bail by the Central booking support group. This implies they provided assistance or facilitated the release, making them the ones who provided help (pahkam hkam ya ai) in this context.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai jahkring rim rawng da ai lam hta hkan nna, rim hkrum na ni hpe aten 24 hta jan na rim rawng na matu hpa ahkang ni jaw da rai ai rai?","Based on the passage, the answer is **C: Glynn tara agyi ni hku nna tara shang jahkrat ai tara** (Glynn judge's legally mandated rule).

Here's why:

The passage states that after being arrested, individuals are typically released from Central Booking without paying bail if it's their first offense. However, *if* the Judge Glynn's court identifies repeat offenders (those who ignored court dates), a 24-hour hold is initiated. This hold is authorized by Judge Glynn's legally mandated rule.
"
"Laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, galaw taw nga lam ni hpe matut n galaw sai lam sanglang dan na matu gara madi madun ai lam hpe n jai lang ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Shim lam hte seng nna hkra machyi na lam nga ai.**

Here's why:

*   **The question asks why certain actions are being continued despite causing harm.**
*   The passage indicates that despite issues (lack of transparency, potentially violating the constitution), some actions are still ongoing. The reason for continuing these actions is that stopping them could impact security.
*   The other options are mentioned as problems caused by the actions, not reasons for continuing them."
Hpang jahtum hta sumtsan kasa ni gaw gawlaw taw nga ai ni hpe hpa majaw n ra sai ngu sawn ai rai?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: Npawt nhpang gawda tara upadi hta luchyum ndan leng ai lam nga ai**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that observers believe ""Afghan a gawda tara hpe ra mung nra ai hte maren, matut shagrin daw dan sa wa ai lam hta dan leng lam law law mung nnga ai hpe mu mada ma ai nga tsun ma ai."" This translates to observers seeing a lack of clarity in how Afghan laws are being applied. This directly supports the idea that there is a lack of clarity within the constitutional framework itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dai gaw npawt nhpang upadi hte n hten shai ai (That is not in violation of the constitution)**: The passage implies that the actions *might* be against the constitution.
*   **B: Dai hta shim lam hte seng nna hkra machyi na lam nga ai (There is a chance it will hurt the peace process)**: The passage mentions the importance of peace (""simlum ai lam hta nhkra hkra""), but this is not the main reason for the observer's concerns. The primary concern is the lack of clarity in the application of the law.
*   **D: Ningbaw ra lata poi gaw jarik grai tsaw ai (The election of a leader is very expensive)**: The passage mentions money being spent improperly, but not the cost of the election itself being the primary reason observers disapprove."
FATA na matu kadai gaw tara magam hte seng na karum madi shadaw ya ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Mung masa hte seng ai dat kasa**.

The passage states that after Pakistan gained independence, the Pakistani President appointed ""Mung masa dat kasa ni"" (Political Agents) to govern FATA and that these agents were responsible for governing and judging under Article 247 of the Pakistani constitution. Therefore, the Political Agents provided legal support for FATA.
"
"Lawu kaw e tsun da ai ni hta, gara gaw FATA na mung masa hte seng nna n teng ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Shanhte gaw tara magam hte seng ai lam hpe karum madi shadaw ya ai**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** Political Agents were appointed by the President of Pakistan to administer the FATA region after Pakistan gained independence. It also states they were responsible for governance and laws under Article 247 of the Constitution.

Based on this information:

*   **B is true:** They were appointed by the President.
*   **C is true:** They were responsible for upholding Pakistan's Constitution (specifically Article 247).
*   **D is true:** They had administrative power in the FATA region.
*   **A is incorrect:** The passage does not mention anything about helping advocate the legal system.

Therefore, **A is not true.**"
Emma Stone gaw gara shagrau kumhpa na matu tang shawn da ma ai kun?,"The correct answer is **C: Hkrak dik ai sumla hkrung shayi**.

The first sentence of the passage states that Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were nominated for Best Actor and Best Actress respectively: ""Gosling hte Stone gaw Ningtawn dik Sumla hkrung shadang hte shayi hku na yaw shada lata da ai kaw lawm ma ai"".
"
"Sumla hkrung gaw, gara shagrau kumhpa na matu mying tang shawn da n hkrum ai kun?","The passage mentions the following categories where the movie was nominated:

*   Best Picture
*   Best Actor
*   Best Actress
*   Best Director
*   Costume Design
*   Film Editing
*   Original Screenplay
*   Production Design
*   Score
*   Sound Mixing
*   Cinematography
*   Original Song

It explicitly mentions ""Sound Mixing"" and ""Original Song"" as being nominated. It doesn't mention anything about ""Best visual effects"" or ""Best Makeup."" so the answer is:
**B: Hkrak dik ai hkrangmu ladat**"
Lawu kaw na gara ni gaw n-nang nawn byin ngut ai hpang matut ngam taw ai kun?,"Based on the provided text, the following remains affected after the earthquake:

*   **B: Ishikawa kaw na nbungli daru (Ishikawa kaw na nbungli daru)** - The text states ""Ishikawa uphkang ginwang na Noto Nbungli daru gaw naw pat tawn ai re."" (Ishikawa Prefecture's Noto Airport is still closed.)

The other options are incorrect because:

*   A: Hokuriku's Shika jak rung na shingja dat kabaw bunghkraw ni yawng - The text mentions that the Hokuriku Electric Power Company shut down the Shika Nuclear Power Plant's reactors and that there were no further consequences.
*   C: Wanleng hkawm ai magam bungli yawng - The text says that some train services were suspended, not all.
*   D: Niigata kaw na n-gun jak rung langai - The text says that the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant in Niigata is operating, not experiencing continuing problems.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B**."
"Laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw n-nang nawn a majaw hten za ai lam hpe hkam jan lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Shika jak rung kaw na shingja dat kabaw bunghkraw lahkawng**.

The passage states that ""Hokuriku myi hprap wan n-gun hpung gaw Shika shingra dat n-gun lang ai jak rung a shingja dat kabaw bunghkrawng nambat 1 hte 2 hpe sat tawn lai wa ai lam hte n-nang nawn a majaw kaga akyu hkam sha ai lam n-nga lai wa ai hpe shiga shana lai wa sai re.""

This translates to: ""Hokuriku Electric Power Company reported that the shutdown of reactors 1 and 2 at the Shika Nuclear Power Plant due to the earthquake did not cause any further damage."" Therefore, the two reactors at the Shika plant were able to withstand the earthquake without further damage.
"
"Laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara manghkang ni gaw matsing ningting laika hta n lawm ai kun?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: 1967 majan a byin ninghpang** (the causes of the 1967 war).

Here's why:

*   **A: Yerusalem a htawm hpang shawng lam (The future of Jerusalem)** - The passage *explicitly* mentions Jerusalem's future and its inclusion in negotiations, ""Yerusalem mare kaba ngu ka shalawm da ma ai"" (Jerusalem city is included).

*   **C: Hka masawn hta hpyen magam dap shara jahkrat da ai lam (Establishment of military bases in the riverbank)** - The text talks about PA staying for 5 years and Israel asking for full military presence for 10 years in that area which includes the Jordan River.

*   **D: Ga jarit hte seng nna htai lai hkat ai lam (Disagreements over borders)** - The first sentence directly states there are ""ga jarit htai lai hkat ai"" (border disagreements), referencing the 1967 borders.

*   **B: 1967 majan a byin ninghpang (the causes of the 1967 war)** - While the *outcome* (pre-1967 borders) of the 1967 war is mentioned, the text *doesn't discuss* the *causes* or *origins* of that war. The text simply uses the war as a historical reference point for the desired borders.

Therefore, the text doesn't provide information or discuss the **origins of 1967 war**."
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Palestine a hpyi shawn ai lam kaw na langai mi n re ai kun?,"The correct answer is **B: Yawdan hka masawn kaw na galaw nga ding ngam hpyen magam dap shara jahkrat da ai lam**

Here's why:

*   **A: Majan garai n byin shi ten hta na ga jarit (Borders from before the war):** The passage explicitly states that the Palestinians desire borders based on those existing before the 1967 Middle East war.
*   **C: Yerusalem a htawm hpang shawng lam hte seng nna mahtai ni (Solutions regarding the future of Jerusalem):** The passage mentions Jerusalem as a key point in future discussions, confirming it's part of their concerns.
*   **D: Yawdan hka masawn hta manga ning hpyen magam dap shara jahkrat da ai lam (Deployment of military camps in the Jordan River area for five years):** The passage mentions that the PA agreed to stay in the area for 5 years, indicating a request related to this presence.

*   **B: Yawdan hka masawn kaw na galaw nga ding ngam hpyen magam dap shara jahkrat da ai lam (Permanent establishment of military camps in the Jordan River area):** Israel wanted to keep troops in place for an extended period of time, and that is the opposite of what the PA wanted. Therefore, the request to establish a permanent military camp in the Jordan River area is not related to what the Palestinians desired."
Ma gaw gara mung hta tara upadi hpe sharin hka ja la wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: America mung**.

The text states that Ma studied at New York University and Harvard Law School, both of which are in America.
"
"Laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, mungdan gara hpe madi shadaw ai lam gaw MA na ra lata poi awng padang hpe karum ya ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Miwa mung**.

The passage states that despite the criticisms, Ma was able to overcome them by ""consistently supporting his mother country, China."" This indicates that his support for China helped him win the election.
"
"Lahta kaw na laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, Caolyn Wilson gaw mare kaw na n pru shi ai shaloi, kade a matu bungli galaw lai wa sai rai?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**

The passage states ""...lawm ai htinggaw law malawng gaw OHA a Carolyn Wilson gaw shanhte a tau jaw da ai jaram gumphraw ni hpe lagu la nna mare kaw na hprawng mat sai..."" ( ""...most families remembered that Carolyn Wilson of OHA had stolen their down payment money and fled the city..."")

This clearly indicates that Carolyn Wilson worked for the OHA.
"
"Ndai numdaw hta mali lang shingjawng na lam naw ngam ai hte, kadai wa gaw Mawdaw gau shingjawng poi hta nambat mali rai taw ai kun?","The correct answer is **D: Bowyer**

The paragraph states that Hamlin is in third place, and he is more than five points ahead of Bowyer. This means Bowyer is in fourth place.
"
"Laika daw hta matut manoi tsun da shing jawng poi hta, mawdaw shingjawng ai lam hta Kahne gaw a mat kade lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The passage states: ""Kahne and Truex, Jr. ni gaw manga hte kru shara kaw 2,220 hte 2,207 amat ni lu da ma ai."" This directly tells us Kahne has 2,220 points.
"
"Lahta kaw na laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpang de martian madung re ngu sawk sagaw lu ai wanhkut lung ni hpe, masha ni kade lang myi mu ga sai rai?","The correct answer is **C: shi manga lang**.

The passage states: ""Ndai lung rawk shi manga hpe July hpang jahtum hta shagan wanhkut lung madun ai ngu sawn la ma ai."" This translates to ""These fifteen rocks are believed to be Martian meteorites."" This indicates that fifteen rocks are believed to be Martian in origin.
"
"Lahta kaw na laika daw hta tsun da ai zawn, madung hta martian ngu sawk sagawn lu ai nlung ni hte seng nna gara wa jaw ai kun?","The correct answer is **D: Nlung 34 re**.

The passage states: ""...dai kaw na 34 hpe gaw martian hku na madung shateng da ai."" ( ""...of which 34 are fundamentally identified as Martian."") This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dai nlung ni yawng hpe, July wanhkut madun ai** (All the stones were displayed in July) The passage states that *shi manga hpe* (these five) were identified as meteorites in late July, not all 34.
*   **B: Nlung 24,000 re** (There are 24,000 stones). The passage mentions 24,000 wanhkut lung ngu chye da ai a ngam ai hte gaw mungkan ga de hkrat wa na re (Wanhkut lung that are known to be 24,000 remain and will fall to Earth), but this is not the number of Martian rocks.
*   **C: Nlung dai ni gaw ja hta grau nna US dollar gumhpraw 11,000 ging dan ai** (These stones are worth more than gold, at US$11,000). The passage mentions that *some* Earth rocks that are rare are worth ten times the price of gold, from US$11,000 to US$22,500 per ounce. It doesn't say this about the Martian rocks."
Schumacher gaw galoi hkring sa mat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Felipe Massa hpe galai ngut ai hpang** (After replacing Felipe Massa).

The passage states that Schumacher retired in 2006 after winning his seventh Formula 1 championship, due to Felipe Massa taking his place.
"
Massa galoi hkumhkrang machyi hkra la ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Grand Pix laman hta**.

The passage states that Massa was injured during the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix. Grand Prix means ""Grand Prix"".
"
"Lahta kaw na laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, hkyen lajang ai lam gaw AOL hpe gara hku akyu jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: AOL gaw IM gat lawk bungli hpe galaw ai, langai sha nga ai hpaga hpung byin wa na**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""...AOL gaw United States kata grai chyam bra hkra jai lang nga ai majaw de shara hta nan gaw IM gat lawk bungli naw galaw taw ai."" This directly implies that AOL is currently doing IM platform business.
*   The passage also says that because of the regulations, the advantage AOL currently has will disappear. Because Yahoo and Microsoft users combined will exceed AOL users. So AOL will no longer be the unique company doing IM platform business.

Let's analyze the other options:

*   **A: AOL hpe jai lang ai masha ni law wa na lam nga ai** (There is a possibility that more people will use AOL) - The passage suggests the opposite; AOL's user base might decline relative to Yahoo! and Microsoft.
*   **C: AOL hpe jai lang ai masha ni gaw Yahoo hte Microsoft hpe jai lang ai masha ni hte shingjawng manang rai wa na** (AOL users will become competitors with Yahoo and Microsoft users) - Users of different platforms aren't necessarily competitors.
*   **D: United States hta AOL hpe n jai lang wa na re** (AOL will no longer be used in the United States) - The passage suggests a decrease in dominance, but not a complete disappearance."
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, hkyen lajang ai lam ningnan hpe jahtum kau mai na rai?","The correct answer is **C: AOL gaw shi a shara hta gat lawk hpe madu ra ai hku galaw lu ai ahkang** (AOL's exclusive right to operate an IM gateway at its location).

Here's why:

The passage states that the proposed arrangement threatens AOL's exclusive right to operate an IM gateway at its location. If this right is *not* threatened, then the arrangement would not be able to stop it. Therefore, any reason that AOL's access is not limited/threatened will jahtum it.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: United States hta chyam bra wa ai internet bawng ring lam** (Growth of Internet infrastructure in the United States): While related, this is a broader factor and doesn't directly address the specific threat to AOL's exclusive right.
*   **B: IM gat lawk hpe jai lang ai lam** (Usage of IM gateways): The usage of IM gateways could continue to exist, but it does not necessarily mean that AOL's exclusive right is continued.
*   **D: Yahoo hte Microsoft a rau galaw lam** (Collaboration between Yahoo and Microsoft): Whether or not Yahoo and Microsoft work together is not necessarily related to AOL's exclusive right."
"Htim gasat ai hta asak si hkrum ai kaw na, pyada du n rai ai marai kade rai?","The correct answer is **A: 19**.

Here's the breakdown:

*   The passage states that two police officers were killed.
*   The passage also states that over a hundred people were injured.
*   The question asks about the number of non-police personnel who died, and the passage states ""pyada du lahkawng si hkrum ai hte kaga masha hkun jan hkala nba hkrum lai wa sai"".

The best interpretation of this information is that the ""kaga masha"" represents the people who are not police officers, and that the number of these people who have died from the incident is 19."
Htim gasat ai kaw na nrup ntsen ai wa hpe kadai shiga jaw dat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Pyada (Police)**.

The passage states: ""Pyada la wa tsun lai wa ai gaw, shanhte gaw htim gasat ai na matu lit nga ai ngu shadu da ai gasat myit rawt ai Daesh (ISIL) hpe nrup nsen ai re.""  This translates to ""Police officers said that they are challenging Daesh (ISIL), the militant group believed to be responsible for the attack.""  Therefore, the police are the ones challenging the group responsible.
"
"Florida na dang ai wa mungdaw yawng la madang a majaw, Mitt Romney hpe hpa kumhpa shagrau ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Republican Pati na matu mying tang shaw da ai lam** (Republican Party nomination race).

Here's why:

The passage states ""Florida gaw Republikan Pati mying tang shawng lam a matu Romney hpe yawng a shawng hta woi awn na hku na..."" which translates to ""Florida, with its winner-take-all system, puts Romney in the lead for the Republican Party nomination race...""

Therefore, the win in Florida gives Romney a significant advantage in the Republican Party nomination race.
"
"Lahta kaw na laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, ra lata poi hta Gingrich kaw tsa lam kaw na me kade ram nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: tsa lam shadang 32**

The passage states, ""Galoi mung na U.S Rapdaw Tingnyang up Newt Gingrich gaw tsa lam shadang 32 hte nambat lahkawng kaw hkan ai."" This directly translates to Newt Gingrich receiving 32 percent of the votes.
"
"Lahta kaw na laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, mung masa pati dat kasa lata zuphpawng na mahtai chye ngut ai hpang, kadai gaw matut nna hpang n hkan mat ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Bachmann**.

The passage states: ""August shata hta Ames Straw Poll hpe dang da ai Bachmann gaw shi a me lu hkra hkaw tsun ai lam (campaign) hpe jahkring kau na matu daw dan sai."" This translates to: ""Bachmann, who won the Ames Straw Poll in August, decided to stop her campaign."" This directly indicates that she discontinued her campaign after the results mentioned in the passage.
"
"Lahta kaw na laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, mung masa pati dat kasa lata zuphpawng na mahtai chye ngut ai hpang, kadai gaw kaga shang shingjawng ai wa a lam hpe tak kaba tsun ai rai?","The correct answer is B: Gingrich.

The passage states that after the results, ""Ginrich gaw Santorum hpe shakawn lai wa sai rai timung Gingrich gawng malai galaw ai Iowa kaw gaw shi hpe ninghkap nna me lu hkra galaw ai lam ndau shabra laika ni hpe shabra lai wa sai majaw Romney a matu gaw mazut ai ga si ni hte lang lai wa sai re."" This translates to: ""Gingrich praised Santorum, but in Iowa, where Gingrich campaigned, he distributed leaflets opposing him, and for Romney, he used harsh words."" Thus, Gingrich spoke negatively about another candidate (Romney).
"
"2015 ning a shawng shaning e, dai lamang madun ai shara gaw gara kaw rai?","The correct answer is **A: TogiNet Radio**.

The passage states: ""Moi shaloi hkan gaw, ndai lamang hpe """"""""TogiNet Radio"""""""" ngu ai ga shaga ai rediyu lamang hpe law malawng galaw ai kumpyuta tsip ntsa na rediyu site kaw sha shalat ai re."" This translates to ""In the past, this program was only broadcast on TogiNet Radio, a voice-over radio program on a computer chip-based radio site.""  Since the question asks about the broadcast location *before* 2015, TogiNet Radio is the correct answer.
"
Radio shapoi dap gaw dai lamang hpe ganing re kamung ngu htawng madun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Jawng dingsa**.

The passage states: ""Radio shapoi dap ai web site hta lamang hpe """"""""ningnan shachyai dik hkra shachyai mai ai jawng dingsa na radio kamung naura!"""""""" ngu htawng madun ai.""  This translates to ""The radio station's website advertises the program as a """"""""newly expanded alumni radio network!""""""""

Therefore, the radio station advertises the program as an **alumni** network.
"
Gasat gala myit rawt taw ai uhpung na htim gasat ai lam hpe dik shale karum ya ai hpa baw hpe David Headley mahkawng wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shiga**.

The text states, ""David Headley a shiga lahkawn da ai lam gaw...majan awngdang na matu lu karum da ai."" This translates to ""David Headley's information gathering helped...in the success of the attack.""

Therefore, the information collected by David Headley was crucial in aiding the attackers.
"
Gasat gala myit rawt taw ai hpyen uhpung ni gaw Mumbai de bu hkram na matu kaning rai htaw wa htaw sa lam hpe jai lang wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Hkali**

The first sentence of the passage states that the attackers arrived in Mumbai by boat (""hkali"").
"
Laika daw hta tsun da ai Nadal hte Raonic yan a Brisbane Hpaw poi shing jawng ai lam mahtai hpe tup hkrak dawng pru ya ai gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Raonic gaw Nadal hpe dang kau ai** (Raonic defeated Nadal).

The text states that Nadal lost to Raonic only at the Brisbane Open during this period: ""Shi gaw ndai laman sha Raonic hpe Brisbane hpaw poi hta sha sum da ai rai nga ai."" This directly translates to ""He (Nadal) only lost to Raonic at the Brisbane Open during this period.""
"
"Laika daw hta tsun da hte maren, ningshawng shingjawng poi ngut ai hpang Nadal hte Raonic a poi masa gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **B: Nadal gaw amat 76 dang la sai**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Nadal gaw ginsup lamang 88% hta amat 76 hte shawng lu nna dang ai"" (Nadal won 76 points first in 88% of the tennis games and won).

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Raonic hta 88% net amat nga ai** - The passage states Nadal won 76 points first in 88% of the games, not Raonic.
*   **C: lu amat gaw 7-2 re** - While Nadal won 7-2 against a Canadian, this doesn't directly describe the points immediately *after* this specific match.
*   **D: Raonic gaw Nadal hpe dang kau ai** - The passage says Nadal only lost to Raonic at the Brisbane open, but it does not mean the most recent match resulted in a Raonic victory."
Naked Shiga dap nnan masum kaw gara aga lamang n lawm ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Japan ga**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""English hte Japan hku gaw mi kaw na shiga shapoi taw sai re nna..."" which means news in English and Japanese is already being broadcast.
*   The passage later mentions ""Spain ga, Italy ga, Korea ga lamang ni hpe hkrangmu shiga, internet laika man ni hte gun hkawm mai ai jak ni a matu shabra hpang taw sai re"" which means that Spanish, Italian and Korean languages are planned to be added.
*   Therefore, Japan ga (Japanese) is not a new language being added."
"Laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, Naked Shiga dap kaw na shi shana dap nnan hpe gara kaw n lu mai na rai?","The correct answer is **C: Poi yu ginra ni**.

The paragraph states that Naked Shiga disseminates news through:

*   Their existing news outlets in English and Japanese.
*   New outlets in Spanish, Italian, and Korean, specifically through ""hkrangmu shiga, internet laika man ni hte gun hkawm mai ai jak ni a matu"" (audio news, internet websites, and portable devices).

While the paragraph lists audio programs, internet websites and portable devices to carry information, it does not specifically mention that they will have new programs at poi yu ginra ni (movie theaters).
"
Giant Slalom hpe pandung de n lu shangut mat ai shingjawng masha kade rai?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

The passage states: ""Hkyen jawn masha yawng 117 kaw na 45 gaw Giant Slalom kaw shingjawng poi madang tsang masat ai lam kaw hkrat sum lai wa sai re."" This translates to ""Out of all 117 skiers, 45 failed to complete the Giant Slalom due to disqualification.""
"
"Lawu kaw na tsun da ai lam ni hta, gara gaw ninghkrin shingjawng poi a awng jahpan hpe tup hkrak dawng pru ya ai rai?","Let's analyze each option based on the provided text:

*   **A: Lahkawng lang na shingjawng poi hta, Carpenado gaw Hungary kaw na hkyen jawn ai wa hta na shawng pandung shawng du lu sai**

    The text says Carpenado finished the Giant Slalom with a time 1:09.02 ahead of the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani. This means Carpenado was ahead, therefore this is likely a correct statement.

*   **B: Hkyen jawn marai 45 gaw Giant Slalom hta shanhte a gat shingjawng ai lam pandung hpe n lu shangut la ai**

    The text states that 45 out of 117 participants in the Giant Slalom ""failed to meet the standard."" This doesn't necessarily mean they didn't finish, but rather that their performance was below a certain threshold. So, this isn't definitively true.

*   **C: Hkyen jawn shingjawng ai ni law malawng gaw Slalom hta grau na Giant Slalom hpe pandung de du lu sai**

    The text says 36 out of 116 in Slalom didn't finish. For Giant Slalom, 4 out of all women did not finish. We don't know the total number of participants in women's division, so we can't compare the exact proportion between the two events.

*   **D: Carpendo gaw Slalom hta nambat shi lu sai**

    The text states Carpanedo did not reach the end in the first race, Slalom. Therefore, this is false.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the most accurate statement is **A**."
Lawu kaw na gara wa hpe NBA jahkring kau na matu daw dan kau ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Utah Jazz kaw na ginsup ninghkrin**.

The passage states that the NBA suspended the season because a player from the Utah Jazz tested positive for COVID-19.
"
"Laika daw da tsun da ai zawn, lawu kaw na gara gaw virus hte seng nna NBA a myit tsang ai lam hpe byin shangun ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Utah Jazz lamang na matu ginsup ninghkrin langai ana kap ai lam**.

The passage clearly states that the NBA suspended the season because a player on the Utah Jazz tested positive for COVID-19.
"
Atlanta Thrashers hte shingjawng ai lamang hta Washington muklum na matu kadai wa gaw ginsup ai lam hta dang wa na matu goal hpe lu la sai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Nicklas Backstrom**.

The passage states: ""Nicklas Backstrom hpe Ovechkin na dai shana shawng nna madi sadaw ai gaw dai jinsup ai lama hta dang wa na matu goal re."" This translates to ""Ovechkin was assisted by Nicklas Backstrom in his first goal that night which was the game-winning goal."" Thus, Backstrom assisted on the game-winning goal."
Washington muklum hte Thrashers shingjawng poi lamang laman hta kadai wa gaw shi a numdaw 60 lang na goal hpe lu la mat sai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

The passage states that Ovechkin scored his 60th goal of the season during the game, joining Jagr and Lemieux as the only rookies to achieve that milestone since 1995-96.
"
Northern Rock gumhpraw dum gaw galoi aten hta asuya kaw karum ningtum ai hpe ra wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Hka hte hkoi shap sha ra ai chyat ladaw hta**.

The passage states: ""2007 ning na hka hte hkoi shap sha ra ai ginchyum chyat ladaw hta dai hku byin pru ai majaw Dingda Rock gaw karum kahtau ra mat ai.""  This translates to: ""During the credit crunch of 2007, due to the situation, Northern Rock needed support.""
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw Virgin Uhpung a Northern Rock Gumhpraw Dum hte myit hkrum ai lam hpe tup hkrak tsun dan ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Virgin Uhpung ma Northern Rock a manu dan rai hparan ai company hpe mari wa sai**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Virgin gaw Dingdung Lung rawk a ""kaja ai gumhpraw dum"" hpe sha mari da ai, company a reng hkang lam gaw n madu ai.""  This directly translates to Virgin buying the ""good bank"" portion of Northern Rock's assets.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Virgin Uhpung gaw shi a mung shawa rai shatai la ngut ai hpang Gumhpraw Dum hpe mari wa sai** - The passage indicates that the split of ""good bank"" from ""bad bank"" occurred *during* the nationalization, not after.
* **C: hka hte hkoi shap sha ra ai ginchyum chyat ladaw hta Virgin Uhpung gaw Gumhpraw Dum hpe ra ahkyak madi shadaw wa sai** - The passage states that the *UK government* supported Northern Rock during the financial crisis, not Virgin. Virgin made a later attempt to acquire the bank.
* **D: Virgin Group a gumhpraw dum na matu ningshawng bid gaw bank natioanl ngut ai hpang galaw lai wa sai** - The order is incorrect. It was after the nationalization and the creation of the ""good bank"" and ""bad bank"" that the purchase occurred.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate reflection of the text.
"
"Laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, Kyoto lamu marang myit hkrum hta lata masat htu ai a majaw gara mung gaw akyu lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Australia**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the decision for Mr. Rudd to sign the Kyoto Protocol ""divided the United States"".
*   The passage also states that Australia refused to ratify Kyoto in the past ""fearing that they would sacrifice their coal industry"".
*   India and China were mentioned in context with their development.

Therefore, the correct answer is Australia."
Australia na shawng asuya gaw Kyoto na shagrin ai lam wa kadai hpe sum machyi na lam byin hkun na ngu shadu sai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Nlung chyang sa ai bungli ni** (Mining Industry).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Moi na Australia mungdan aup ni gaw Koyto hpe ahkang jaw na matu ndang ma ai, shanhte gaw nlung chyang sa ai bungli hpe chyhten na ni re ngu tsun ai"" which translates to ""The former Australian governments opposed Kyoto approval because they said it would harm the mining industry.""

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: United States** - While the first sentence mentions the US being divided, the reason Australia opposed Kyoto was due to concerns about its own mining industry.
*   **B: mungdan a hpaga lam** (National Economy) - While the mining industry's decline could impact the national economy, the passage specifically refers to the mining industry.
*   **D: Mungdan a shapraw gunrai yaw shada lam** (National Manufacturing output) - The passage doesn't mention or imply any loss for manufacturing outputs.
"
Yi sun kaw na shan gap ginsup ai ni hpe hpa lamang a matu lata la sai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Shan Gap Ginsup Uhpung a shan hkwi ai lamang**.

The passage states: ""NPWS a rau bungli galaw ai hte Australia a Shan gap Ginsup Hpung (NSW) Inc gaw Shan gap Ginsup Hpung a **shan gap lamang kata** na atsam ningja hpring ai daw jau masha ni hpe lata san da ma ai.""

This clearly indicates that the selected individuals are part of the *Shan Gap Ginsup Hpung's shan gap lamang* (Hunting and Conservation Society's hunting program). Therefore option D is correct.
"
"Lawu kaw na tsun da ai hta, yi sun ni hpe chyahten chye ai akawng ni hpe sat ai tsi hte seng nna gara gaw tup hkrak n lu tsun dan ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Lamang a ningshawng jep chyam yu ai lam re majaw, atsawm sha n lu daw dan sawn la lu ai** (Because it is a preliminary test of the program, it cannot be accurately determined)

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on how people are learning about controlling feral pigs (akawng ni) using poison and the selection of qualified shooters.** It highlights collaboration, training, and safety protocols.
* **The provided statement ""yi sun ni hpe chyahten chye ai akawng ni hpe sat ai tsi hte seng nna gara gaw tup hkrak n lu tsun dan ai rai?"" asks what *cannot* be determined accurately about the use of poison to kill pigs.**
* **Options B, C, and D** are directly supported by the passage: shooters receive instruction, are selected, and follow guidelines.  We know these things are happening.
* **Option A** aligns with the limited scope described. The passage describes the *beginning* of a program, so making definitive statements about the program's success regarding the poison's efficacy would be premature. Therefore, we can't definitively say how well the poison aspect of the program is working.

In summary, because the passage describes the initial stages of the program, accurately assessing the long-term effectiveness of using poison on the pigs is uncertain. Thus, A is the correct answer.
"
"Laika kaw tsun da hte maren, ga garan ai hpe gara kaw mu wa sai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Namhkan lung hta**.

The passage states ""Ndai namhkan lung hta mahta nna, dai ga garan mat ai..."" which translates to ""Based on this fossil skull, the division of the species..."" This directly connects the discovery of the species division to the fossil skull.
"
"Laika daw hta tsun da hte maren, myit mada da ai lam hta jau na byin wa ai gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **B: Ga garan mat ai lam** (the splitting of the earth).

Here's why:

The passage directly states: ""Ndai namhkan lung hta mahta nna, dai **ga garan mat ai** gaw molecular ni a sakse ni nlawm ai tim jau tak da ai hta grau loi ai hpe ngu mayu ai re."" This translates to: ""Based on this fossil, the **splitting of the earth** is more likely to have happened earlier than previously assumed, even without molecular evidence.""

Therefore, the passage clearly indicates that the ""ga garan mat ai lam"" (splitting of the earth) is what is believed to have happened earlier than expected.
"
"Sumla hkrung ginsup ai laman hta shamu shamawt ai lam hpe jum lang na matu, ginsup ai wa gaw hpa baw galaw ra na rai?","The correct answer is **D: Nbung ntsa kaw up hkang ai hpe shamawt na** (To wave the controller in the air).

The passage states: ""Ndai gaw sumla hkrung ginsup hpan hta jak ni hpe nbung ntsa kaw shamawt nna ginsup masha ni hpe galaw ai lam hte shamu shamawt ai lam hpe uphkang lu na matu ahkang jaw nga ai re."" This translates to ""This allows the player to control the character's actions and movements in the game by waving the controller in the air.""
"
TV sumtsan hkang hkinghku hte bung hkra hpa hpe shalat sai rai?,"The answer is **A: Up hkang ai a maju hkam hkinghku lahkawng**.

The passage states that the controller for the Nintendo Revolution resembled a TV remote. It also says this controller had two sensors that detected movement. Therefore, the two sensors of the controller were designed to resemble a TV remote.
"
Xinhua Shiga dat kasa dap na hpang jahtum laika hta hpa hpe n tsun shapraw da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Urumqi kaw pyenli yu wa sai lam**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Urumqi kaw hkyak sha nbungli yu na matu galaw ai hta ahkang njaw ai majaw Afghanistan de bai yawng mat ai."" This means the plane tried to land in Urumqi but was not allowed to, and therefore returned to Afghanistan. It did *not* land in Urumqi.

The other options are all mentioned in the passage.
"
Xinhua shiga dat kasa na jau dik ai laika hta hpa hpe n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Pyenli hpe zing na hpung ai**

Here's why:

*   **P** explicitly states: ""Miwa shiga dap re nga ai Xinhua gaw pyenli langai hpe zing na hpung nga ai lam shiga jau shana da ai."" This translates to ""Xinhua, a Chinese news agency, initially reported that there was a threat to hijack a plane.""
*   Therefore, the initial report from Xinhua *did* mention the threat of hijacking.

The other options were all mentioned in the latter part of the news:

*   **B: Pyenli gaw kyak sha nbungli yu na matu nyet kau hkrum ai** is mentioned: ""Urumqi kaw hkyak sha nbungli yu na matu galaw ai hta ahkang njaw ai majaw Afghanistan de bai yawng mat ai.""
*   **C: Pyenli hpe Afghanistan de lam nhtang shangun ai** is mentioned: ""Afghanistan de nhtang gayin shangun nna Kandahar kaw wa jahkring shangun da hkrum ai.""
*   **D: pyenli hpe bawm jahkrit shama ai lam** is mentioned: ""nbungli hpe bawm hte jahkrit la nna Afghanistan de nhtang gayin shangun nna Kandahar kaw wa jahkring shangun da hkrum ai.""

So, the only option not specifically mentioned in the initial report is **A**.
"
Radio shana lamang laman hta Sara Danius hpa hpe ndau shabra wa rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Bob Dylan hte matut mahkai na matu kompti hku nna atsam sim mat na**.

The passage states that Sara Danius announced that the committee had stopped trying to reach Bob Dylan and trying to get him to accept the Nobel Prize. This is equivalent to saying the committee was giving up on contacting him.
"
Kadai wa hpe n lu matut mahkai lu mat ai rai?,"The passage states that Sara Danius tried contacting people by phone and email, but doesn't say who she couldn't reach. However, it implies that she was trying to contact someone to ensure Bob Dylan could accept the award. The most logical answer is:

*   **D: Bob Dylan**

Therefore, the answer is D.
"
"""Dai ga sadi gaw """"ahkrak ai numdaw"""" re ai lam hpe kadai myit ningmu shapraw wa ai rai?""","The correct answer is **C: Gordon Johndroe**.

The passage states that Gordon Johndroe, who is identified as Bush's spokesman, said the agreement was an ""important step.""
"
Slania gaw mungdan amyu law malawng a matu dazik kade ram galaw shapru wa sai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: 1,000 jan** (which means ""more than 1,000"").
"
"Laika hta tsun da hte maren, tank vent kaw na kayun ai lam byin wa hkun ai gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **C: Kahtet dat hte seng ai law mat ai** (Too much pressure related to thermal expansion).

The passage states: ""Dam shani ka'ang kaw, tank vent kaw na matut lwi taw ai gaw tank kata kaw na kahtet dat law mat ai majaw re sam ai."" This translates to ""During the sunny afternoon, the continuous leakage from the tank vent was probably due to too much pressure inside the tank.""
"
Hpa majaw matsut hpaw mat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Tank kata hta kahtet ai dat law mat ai (Loss of containment within the tank)**.

The passage states: ""Dam shani ka'ang kaw, tank vent kaw na matut lwi taw ai gaw tank kata kaw na kahtet dat law mat ai majaw re sam ai."" This directly translates to the leaking from the tank vent during the day being attributed to the loss of containment within the tank.
"
"Ndai laman, jahku ngu na mare lawk hta hka kade tsaw taw ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Ginshang-ram**.

The passage states ""hka gaw ginshang du hkra tsaw taw nga ai,"" which means the water is as high as the ground.
"
"Hurricane Katrina laman, jahku ngu na mare lawk hta hpa byin wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Hka kaba ai gaw 20 pe tsaw ai** (The flooding was 20 feet high).

The passage states: ""Katrina laru laman pe 20 daram tsaw hkra hka kaba ai hpe mu da ai jahku ngu na mare lawk..."" which translates to ""In the ninth ward, the flooding was seen to be about 20 feet high during Hurricane Katrina...""
"
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, Hamilton a shagrin da ai lam n rai ai kun?","The correct answer is **D: Machyi masha a ndai laman mabyin masa** (Patient's current condition).

Here's why:

*   **A: Machyi masha wa bu hkawm ai shara ni** (The places the patient traveled to) - The passage explicitly mentions the patient traveled to Nigeria, where there was an Ebola outbreak. This is confirmed by Hamilton.
*   **B: Kaga machyi masha na ana zingli hte hkra ai lam byin na masa** (The risk of other patients being infected) - The passage states the hospital is taking precautions to prevent the spread of the disease. This concern is confirmed by Hamilton's actions.
*   **C: Hkrang madung hpe hkan nang hkan sa ai lam nga n nga** (Whether or not standard protocols are being followed) - The passage mentions the hospital following established protocols to prevent the spread of infection. This is confirmed by Hamilton.

*   **D: Machyi masha a ndai laman mabyin masa** (Patient's current condition) - While the passage says the patient is stabilizing, it doesn't emphasize the current condition of the patient as a point that Hamilton has particularly affirmed; the emphasis is more on the travel history and the hospital's preventative measures. Thus, this is less emphasized as part of Hamilton's confirmation.

Therefore, option D is the least emphasized aspect of Hamilton's confirmation."
Hpungtang hpaji ninghkrin ni sawk sagawn mayu ai lam gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Mungkan ga gara hku byin wa ai** (How the Earth was formed).

The passage explicitly states that scientists hope to understand ""gara hku byin wa ai"" (how it was formed) in regards to the Earth, particularly how it was shaped (""gara hku shachyaw da ai"").
"
"Laika hta tsun da hte maren, ni htep ai kaw buga pyada dap hku nna gara hku galaw lai wa sai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Shanhte gaw mawdaw jawn ai ni hpe kaga lam de woi matsun dat sai**.

The passage states: ""balik 80 daram gaw kaga lam hku sa lu na matu garum ya nga ai,"" which translates to ""around 80 officers are helping people get through alternate routes"". This directly supports answer C.
"
Ni htep ai ten hta shangna tingrat hpa byin wa sai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Kaga lam hku sa lu na matu garum ya na matu jai lang wa sai** (Used to help people go another way).

The passage states that the vehicles (maw daw jahten ni - referring to the vehicles used as roadblocks) were used to block thieves and to help around 80 police officers go in a different direction.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, sumla gayet sara hpe mawdaw hte n'adawt shi yang hpa byin wa sai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Sumla gayet ai wa gaw shi a mawdaw hpe Sepulveda Boulevard ding yang hta jahkring da sai**.

The text states: ""TMZ yu ngwi shiga dap kaw na ni gaw sumla gayet masha wa gaw Sepulveda Boulevard a aw ra hkran maga de balik ni hpe sumla gayet na matu mawdaw hpe chyahkring da ai hpe chye ma ai..."" which translates to ""TMZ news reporters knew that the paparazzi had stopped their car on the Sepulveda Boulevard to take pictures of the police..."" Therefore, option B is a direct paraphrase of this information.
"
sumla gayet ai wa mawdaw hte n'adawt shi yang shi hpa galaw na maw taw rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Sepulveda Boulevard hta mawdaw jahkring na**.

The passage states: ""TMZ yu ngwi shiga dap kaw na ni gaw sumla gayet masha wa gaw Sepulveda Boulevard a aw ra hkran maga de balik ni hpe sumla gayet na matu mawdaw hpe chyahkring da ai hpe chye ma ai..."" which translates to: ""TMZ news reported that the paparazzi stopped his car on the Sepulveda Boulevard side to photograph the police...""

This indicates the paparazzi intended to stop their car on Sepulveda Boulevard.
"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw gumsan magam a ana kanu kap ai hpang mabyin masa hpe tup hkrak n lu htai dan ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Shi kaw yuhkraw machyi ningma nga ai**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Machyi ai hte du machyi ai hta lai nna, ngai nga pyaw ai re"" which translates to ""Besides feeling sick and having a cough, I am fine."" This indicates he has a cough.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shi gaw n nga pyaw ai (He is not well)** - The passage says ""ngai nga pyaw ai re"", indicating he is fine besides the symptoms (coughing and feeling ill).
*   **C: Shi gaw ting shaling re sai (He is isolated)** - The passage indicates he will be isolated at home for a period.
*   **D: Shi gaw hkum kahtet taw ai (He has a fever)** - The passage does not mention anything about having a fever."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw gumsan magam wa hte seng nna n teng man ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Shi hta ana kanu grai sawng ai machyi nga ai (He has a very severe case of the coronavirus)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states Rodrigo Arias said he tested positive *but* he doesn't have a severe case.
*   The other options are supported by the text: the passage mentions that he doesn't have a fever (A), will be isolated at home for a few days (B), and is well enough to work from home (C)."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, Cyclone nbung laru gaw galoi n-gun shakya wa na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Maldives de galai n du shi yang**

The passage states that the cyclone winds were 240 kilometers (149 miles per hour) at one point and then decreased to 83 km/h that morning. The expectation is that the winds will regain strength **before reaching Maldives**. So A is the right answer.
"
Cyclone nbung laru tsaw dik lahta kaw nbung kade ja ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Hkying hkum mi hta 149 kilometers**

The passage states: ""Cyclone nbung laru, Maldives ga kaw maun lap hte galaw da ai nhpye ngu ai, aten langai kaw 240 kilometers (149 miles per hour) daram nbung bung ai re."" This indicates the strongest wind speed was equivalent to 240 kilometers, which converts to 149 miles per hour. The question asks for the strongest speed in kilometers, and the passage gives this as 149 miles which comes out to 240 kilometers an hour. Therefore, the correct answer should be A. 
"
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, Karenia brevis na nsam ngu n sawn lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: dai gaw cell langai hta grau nga ai**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Karenia brevis ""kaja wa panglai hte seng ai oganism cell langai kaw sha byin ai re."" (It is only in a single marine organism cell). Therefore, it is NOT more than one cell. The other options are all mentioned in the text as characteristics of Karenia brevis.
"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Karena brevis n lu galaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: hka hpe akyu lu jaw ai (benefit the water)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Karenia brevis creates toxins that harm fish and humans.** It doesn't mention any beneficial effects on the water.
* **A, B, and D** are all directly mentioned in the passage as things Karenia brevis *does* do: destroys fish nerve function, develops in many ways.

Therefore, the only thing Karenia brevis *doesn't* do, according to the passage, is benefit the water.
"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Hurricane Felicia a majaw byin ai mabyin n rai ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: lam ni hka lim ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""De a angaw angam ni gaw zinlawng law malawng hta shang mat ai re tim, htenza ai lam hka lim ai lam hpe shiga kaw npru wa shi ai."" This translates to ""Although its remnants entered the ocean, there were no reports of damage or flooding of roads."" Therefore, road flooding (lam ni hka lim ai) was *not* an event caused by Hurricane Felicia, according to the passage. The other options (A, B, and C) are all implied or directly stated in the passage to have occurred.
"
Gara gaw Hurricane Felicia hte seng nna shut ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: laru a majaw byin ai marang gaw Oahu hpe akyu jaw ai**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the increase in sea level in Oahu was considered an ""impact"". This implies a negative consequence, not a benefit.

The other options are supported by the text:

*   **B:** The passage states the hurricane weakened *before* reaching landfall, implying it was previously stronger.
*   **C:** The passage says the remnants entered the island chain.
*   **D:** The passage mentions some rainfall included intermittent hail."
2009 Hungarian mungdan ga daga mawdaw sengke shingjawng poi a mahtai hpe tup hkrak shingna n lu jung ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Piquet Jr. gaw poi ngut ai hpang shapraw kau hkrum sai** (Piquet Jr. was fired after the race).

The passage states directly: ""Shaning 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix ngut ai hpang Piquet Jr. hpe bungli shapraw kau ai."" (Piquet Jr. was fired after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix). The other options are either interpretations or details about the *cause* of the firing, not the direct result mentioned in the question.
"
Mawdaw adawt ai lam galoi byin wa sai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: shimlam mawdaw n pru wa shi shaloi**.

The passage states that Piquet Jr. crashed *while* he was deliberately crashing to create a safety car situation for Alonso. The goal was for Alonso's car to benefit from the safety car deployment. Therefore, the crash happened *before* the safety car appeared.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw sawk sagawn ai ni madung de kam wa ai hta aten kaji kajaw sha la ai rai?","The passage states: ""United State na Princeton Dakkasu hte Sweden na Uppsala Dakkasu kaw na sawk lik ninghkring ni ndau ai gaw hpan nnan ni gaw ban prat lahkawng kaw sha tsang hte tsang galai shai ma ai. Shara mi kaw sha nga ai Darwin u hpan, Geospiza fortes hte bu htawt cactus uhpan, Geospiza conirostris uhpan lapran chyu jaw ai majaw ndai lam yan hpe aten grau na mai ai ngu kam ma ai.""

This means the researchers believe that because the new species evolved in just two generations, and because it only occurred in a specific location between the *Geospiza fortes* and *Geospiza conirostris* species, this process could happen much faster than previously thought.

Looking at the options:

*   A: amyu baw hpan ni a byin pru ai lam (The origin of species) - This is too broad.

*   B: amyu baw hpan ni a lam hpe sumtang shiga jaw ai lam (Providing information about the species) - This is not the main focus.

*   C: amyu n bung ai lapran ni lawt ai lam (Differences between species) - This is a result of the evolution, not the core belief about time scale.

*   D: amyu baw hpan ni gaw tsang hte tsang galai shai ai lam (Species change generation by generation) - This accurately reflects the researchers' belief that species can evolve and differentiate at a rapid, generational pace.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D**.
"
Sawk sagawn ninghkrin ni hku nna lawu kaw gara hpe sumtang shiga n jaw wa ai rai?,"The answer is **C: Amyu baw hpan nnan a mying** (The name of the new species).

The passage mentions the discovery of a new species of finch, where it was discovered, the institutions involved, how quickly it evolved, and the species it is related to. However, it **does not** explicitly state the name given to the new species.
"
CowParade gara kaw galaw na rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Bucharest muklum hta**.

The passage states that the CowParade is being held ""Bucharest Muklum Gawknu hta"".
"
CowParade hpe lawu kaw gaw gara kaw tup hkrak hpaw tsun dan lu ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: mungkan hta kaba dik ai shawa shingni poi re**

Here's why:

* **P** states ""galaw na mungkan na kaba dik CowParade lamang hpe galaw ai"" which translates to ""organizing the world's largest CowParade event.""

The other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While ""nice cities"" might be associated with CowParade, the passage doesn't explicitly state that's the *only* place it's held.
* **B:** The passage mentions Bucharest City Hall *using* CowParade as part of a campaign, but not originating it.
* **C:** It says it's the first time in Southeast Europe, not that it's held *throughout* the region.
"
Gara gaw Russia hpe II-76 ni jai lang ai kaw na jahkring na matu bying hkun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: kadaw kadan shoihpa lam langai** (a recent accident).

The passage states that Russia temporarily suspended the use of II-76s *after* a recent fatal accident involving the aircraft.
"
II-76 gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Nbungli langai**.

The passage states ""II-76 gaw shaning 1970 hkan na Russian hte Soviet hpyen dap lahkawng yan a madung dawshan langai re nna..."".  This clearly identifies the II-76 as an nbungli (aircraft/airplane).
"
Simpsons a matu laika ka hpung hpe kadai shap wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Simon**.

The passage states that Simon helped produce The Simpsons with Brooks and Groening, and was also responsible for finding the show's initial writing team.
"
"Fluke tsun ai hku rai yang, kadai gaw kaja ai myit ningmu ni hte myit n-gun jaw ai lam ni sa ya ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: num hte la hkum ding dek ni**

The passage states that ""num ni hte la ni lahkawng yan e sa dat ai kaja ai hku mu ai dinglun ai lam ni hte myit n-gun jaw ai lam ni..."" are responsible. This translates to ""men and women, both of whom send good opinions and encouragement...""
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, nkau masha ni gaw num ni hkun na tsun shapraw ai lam hpe nsharawng ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: la hkum ding dek ni**.

Here's why:

*   **P** states that Fluke's conclusion about the lack of success in addressing women's health issues stems from the oppression of women by ""nkau ni"" which directly translates to ""some people"".
*   **Q** asks if some people don't support women expressing their opinions.
*   Based on the context in **P**, the ""nkau ni"" are being further described as ""la ni"", men. Therefore the men are the ones who do not support women expressing their opinions."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara gintawng hkum gaw n-gun atsam nga ai masa nga dik rai?","The correct answer is **A: Mungkan ga** (Earth).

The passage states: ""Anhte chye ai daram gaw, Titan hta grau n-gun atsam nga ai masa hku madun lu ai shara gaw langai sha nga ai, dai gaw Mungkan ga re"" which translates to ""As far as we know, there is only one place that shows more powerful strength than Titan, and that is Earth.""
"
Hkanu hte nawng ni dinghkren mu lu ai ntsin lawm ai hpe gara gintawng hkum hta tam mu ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

The passage mentions that if you stand near the sea, you can see fishes or something else underneath. The passage then says, ""As far as we know, there's only one place that demonstrates more power than Titan, and that is Earth."" This implies that Titan also has a sea where you can see things underneath.
"
ndai sawk sagawn lu ai kaw na gara gaw mun ni hpe masam maram sawk tam ai lam a mahtai n re ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: dusat a u mun nsam**.

Here's why:

*   The passage focuses on the structure, function, and evolutionary origins of dinosaur feathers. It doesn't delve into the specific colors of the feathers. While it mentions carotenoids being present, it doesn't explore the variety of colors that might have existed.

The other options are discussed in the passage:

*   **B:** The passage mentions that the colors in feathers may have served for display and thermoregulation, suggesting that feathers were not solely used for flying, but for balancing body temperature.

*   **C:** The passage mentions scientists discovering the molecular mechanism of feather development in dinosaurs and comparing it to that of modern birds.

*   **D:** The passage confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, and it also discusses the debate about whether these were proto-feathers or fully developed feathers."
Dinosaur mun hta hpa n nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: barbules**.

The passage states: ""dinosaur amun gaw atsawm nkaba wa ai majaw, rachis ngu shaga ai re, raitim shanhte kaw magaw magaw re ngut nna barbules zawn - amun ni nga ai kun - hpaji rawng ni shadu ai gaw rachis zawn amun ni gaw hpang de amun ni zawn kaba wa ai re.""  This indicates the scientists are questioning the presence of barbules in the dinosaur feathers."
ZMapp hte seng nna lawu kaw na gara gaw n jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: byin taw nga ai ana kap ai hpe lu tsi lajang ai lam galaw lu tim si mai kaw na n lu pat shingdang ai**

Here's why:

*   **The passage says:** ZMapp showed promise in the lab, but rigorous studies showed it was less effective at reducing mortality than initially hoped. This means it *doesn't* effectively treat the infection enough to prevent death.

*   **The other options are supported by the passage:**

    *   **A: Antibodies ni hte galaw da ai** - The passage explicitly calls ZMapp an ""antibody cocktail"".
    *   **C: PALM jep chyam yu ai hkrun lam hta renghkang hku nna karum ya sai** - The passage directly mentions its use as a control in the PALM trial.
    *   **D: sharin hka ja ai lam ni madun ai gaw ZMapp a akyu byin ai lam madung de sawn da ai hta grau yawm taw ai** - This reflects the statement that studies showed it was less effective than initially hoped.

Therefore, option B is the only one that contradicts the information given in the passage."
Lawu kaw na gara gaw PALM jep chyam yu ai hpe tup hkrak tsun dan lu ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: ZMapp hpe jep chyam yu ai hkrun lam na npawt ru di hku jai lang wa sai.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""PALM hkrun lam hta, hkang zing na matu Zmapp hpe bang da ai, tsun mayu ai gaw hpung tang hpaji ninghkring ni gaw dai hpe npawt nhpang hku jai lang nna dai hte kaga gawn lajang na lam masum hte shingdaw na matu jai lang ai.""  This directly translates to ZMapp being used as a base or foundation in the PALM trial to compare it with three other treatments.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sharin hka ja ai lam ni madun ai gaw shi hta shawng de sawn lai wa ai hta grau na akyu nga na**: The passage only mentions that ZMapp has not produced good results.
* **B: Kaga tsi lajang ai lam masum hte renghkang tsi hpe shingdaw ngut sai, dai kaw na langai gaw ZMapp re**:  While the passage mentions comparing ZMapp to three other treatments, it doesn't say the comparison is *finished*. Rather, ZMapp is used as the basis for comparison. Also, ZMapp is NOT one of the three treatments being compared.
* **D: byin taw nga ai masa ni hpe tsi lajang ai shaloi masan sa ai lam madun sai**: The passage doesn't state that there was a good outcome.

Therefore, **C** is the most accurate reflection of what the passage says about the PALM trial.
"
Sawk sagawn hpaji masha ni hku nna hkamja lam jep ai jak nnan gaw gara kaw ahkyak dik rai?,"The correct answer is **A: shang gumhpraw yawm ai mungdan ni kaw** (countries with low income).

The passage states the device is important because it can help diagnose diseases like tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria early in *poor countries* that can't afford the expensive treatments available in wealthier nations.  ""Shinda mawng ana hpe sut su ai mungdan ni daram n lu tsi la lu ai matsan ai mungdan hkan na machyi masha ni byin chye ai mawng ana, sinwawp ana, HIV hte hkali ana ni hpe jau jau tam mu mai wa na re"".
"
Tam sagawn hkingrai hpe gaw gap na matu gara lam hpe jai lang na rai?,"The correct answer is **C: dip shapraw mai ai hkamja lam jep ai jak**.

The passage states that Stanford University researchers have developed a ""kamja lam jep ai jak"" (health testing device) that can be produced and sold cheaply. This directly answers the question of what will be used to build the research tool.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw lobate hkraw hte seng nna n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: shata jan na ntsa lam hta shanhte law malawng hpe n mu lu ai**.

Here's why:

* **P** states that the lobate scarps are found *around* the moon and are *small*. This implies they *are* found on the moon's surface, just not necessarily everywhere or in large sizes.  Therefore, the statement that you don't find them on the surface at all is false.

* **A** is correct: P states the scars' existence indicates recent tectonic activity.
* **B** is correct: P says the discovery challenges the idea that the moon is geologically dead (like Earth).
* **C** is correct: P mentions these scarps are due to the moon shrinking.

Therefore, option D is the only one that contradicts the information provided in passage P.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na ga shara hte seng ai gara ningmu gaw shata jan ntsa ginding ga bungli byin taw ai lam hpe madun ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Ga shara ni gaw ndai laman sha ram ram hpan wa sai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ginding a-ga hte seng ai ndai laman sha galaw shapraw dat ai zawn re ai mabyin ni hpe madi madun taw ai re."" This directly translates to the ga shara being recently formed geological activity.
The other options are not the best answer because they are either not the core explanation that highlights geological activity on the moon, or they are too vague and not central to the main point of the statement."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, hka jun ai lam n rai shi yang dai hta grau n nga na gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **C: myi mu sakse hte seng nna bawng ban ai lam**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Adekoya's image has been widely circulated, making eyewitness testimony less valuable. Therefore, *before* any questioning or investigation takes place, the circulation of the photo is likely going to affect further discussions around eyewitness accounts.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, hka sanghpaw ni na matu hpa gaw ndai laman manghkang n re ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: byawng taw ai hkyen** (dazik shakap sha ai sha re).

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions ""Hka ge ni ayai wa ai"" (flooding), ""lamu marang masa nhkrak ai"" (bad weather), ""Hka ge htuk a shadang, htat ai lam gaw sawng dik ai"" (high flood levels and strong currents).
*   The passage also directly translates to ""the last 15 years, **dazik shakap sha ai sha re**,"" which means **""mostly frozen over.""**
*   This implied that the problem is too much water, but 15 years before that, it was not always the case. Therefore, the opposite of it, the lack of frozen ground (or ""mostly frozen over"") is not a problem.
*   Option D most closely captures this idea, meaning **""mostly frozen over.""**

Therefore, the other options are directly mentioned as problems, while this option is not a problem."
"Hka ge ai lam sha n’ga, sa hkye la ni hpa mayak byin taw ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: lamu marang masa ni** (bad weather conditions).

The passage states ""Hka ge ni ayai wa ai hta n ga lamu marang masa nhkrak ai a majaw sa hkye la ai ni a matu mung yak hkak nga ai."" which translates to ""In addition to the flood victims, the rescuers are also having difficulty due to the bad weather conditions.""
"
Gara kam sham ai lam gaw Robert hku nna ngang kang ai kaw na koi gam sai rai?,"The passage states that Robert Flatley refused to give opinions on ""ethical and philosophical issues concerning the beginning of life."" Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: nsoi nsa asak a hpang ai lam (the beginning of life)**
"
Roberts hku nna gara ga baw gaw bawngban na matu shinggyim arawn alai hte grai shai ai hku na hkam sha ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Galai shai lam n nga ai Mungdan Tara rung ginjaw jahkrat masat da ai hkrang tara ni**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states Roberts declined to comment on ""Roberts Flatley gaw ma shabrai ai lam hte seng ai arawn alai hpaji hte nsoi nsa gara kaw na hpang ai ngu ai lam ni hpe myit ningmu jaw na matu nhtap htuk ai nga nna, htai na matu ningdang kau ai."" This translates to Roberts declining to comment, finding it inappropriate to give opinions on ""ethical differences related to Roberts Flatley's child support case.""

Option A is the best fit as it talks about laws and decisions that are already established. Ethical differences are very different from established laws."
Wan shadaw lahkawng gara kaw htoi taw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: lamu maga de**.

The passage states, ""Lamu de madun na matu wan shadaw lahkawng hpe shana tup sharawt tawn da ai,"" which translates to ""Two pillars of fire were raised all day long to point to the sky.""
"
"Laika hta tsun da hte maren, lamu dep wahpang nnan ni htingbut htingra hta galoi gaw gap na rai?","The correct answer is **D: gaw gap ai lam gaw ding ngam re**

Here's why:

* The passage states ""Myit dum shingran nam pan sun hte sa chyai ai ka-ang lapran hta lamu mada wahpang manga hpe gaw gap ding yang re nga ai"" which translates to ""Five sky-scraping pillars are under construction in the middle of the Memorial Glade."" This confirms the construction is ongoing.
"
Kanu marai Sanit gaw lung pu re ai lam hpe gara shiga gaw madi madun taw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: kahtet masat galai shai ai lam**.

The passage states that the sunlight reflectance indicates the soil is similar to lunar soil, showing temperature differences.  The passage explicitly mentions ""Dai ni gaw ntsa man hta shani gaw grau katsi nna shana hta gaw grau lum lum re ai"" (They are cooler during the day and warmer at night). This difference in temperature behavior is a key indicator supporting the claim that the soil is lunar soil.
"
Kana marai Sanit na kahtet ai lai nsam hpe gara hku masam maram ai rai?,"The passage states: ""Nhtoi ahkyeng pru ai shingna gaw shina hte shani a kahtet ai shai ai lam hpe madun ai hku na lung pu ni zawn san ai."" This translates to: ""Sunlight reflecting images are used to examine the temperature differences between night and day in craters.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: nhtoi ahkyeng pru sumla ni (sunlight reflecting images)**
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara nrup ntsen ai gaw n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: shi gaw hkumhkang machyi hkra ai lam n nga ai**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the bomber received medical treatment for injuries sustained from the bombing (""Bawm kapaw ai kaw na lu na ningma hpe tsi tsi lajang ngut ai hpang...""). This indicates that he *was* injured. Therefore, the statement that he had no physical injuries is false.

The other options are supported by the text:

*   A: The passage clearly says he drove a car laden with bombs into a crowd (""bawm kapaw na shajin tawn ai dingsen masum mawdaw hte masha hpawng de gawt shang wa ai"").
*   B: driving car into the crowd and detonating the bombs is definitely public detonating.
*   C: The authorities know he is Uighur (""raitim shi gaw Uighur myu re hpe shanhte chye ai"")."
Htim gasat ai hte seng nna gara shiga hta ahkaw ahkang nga ai ni a shagrin masat da ai lam nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: nrup nsen wa a ningshawng hte hpang jahtum mying**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that authorities don't know the suspect's name (""Ahkang nga ai ni shi mying hpe nchye shi ai re"").
*   Option D, ""the suspect's first and last name,"" directly addresses this piece of information.
*   The other options are not relevant to the information requested in question Q.

"
Ellis Nampan Sun hta galaw na shingjawng poi hta gara ginsup hpung ni ginsup na rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Dingda Africa hte Australia**

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that the Springboks (Dingda Africa) will play the final match of the series against Australia at Ellis Park in Johannesburg."
Springboks gaw shanhte a hpang na shingjawng ai lam hpe gara kaw ginsup na rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Johannesburg**.

The passage states that ""Springboks gaw Australia kaw yungngoi shapyaw ai ten, matut manoi lamang hpang jahtum shingjawng lamang hpe gaw du na bat hta Johannesburg na Ellis Ginsup pa hta galaw mat na re."" This translates to ""The Springboks, while touring Australia, will play their next and final match of the series next week at Ellis Park in Johannesburg.""
"
Ganghkau dabang gaw lit lamang magam gun hpai ai shaloi lawu kaw na gara mayak nga wa sai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: jet jak kanawng n-gun kaw na teng ai shadang hpe hkang zing ra ai lam** (controlling the correct force from the jet engine).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Chiao hte Sharipov gaw jet jak kanawng n-gun shapraw jak garam lajang ai kaw na shim lum nna tsan ai share kaw nga nga ai lam hpe shiga shana lai wa sai re.""  This translates to something like ""Chiao and Sharipov reported that they were in a safe and distant place while adjusting/distributing the force output of the jet engine.""  This implies the main difficulty/responsibility revolved around the jet engine's power.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pyenli n leng lau hkra makawp ya ai hkringrai hpe zing ra ai** (managing the apparatus that protects against the airplane not becoming lightweight): The passage states this apparatus was *removed* (shamat kau ai). Therefore, it was *no longer* a responsibility or difficulty.
* **C: jet pyenli hpe gau mai hkra galaw ai lam** (making it possible to control the jet airplane): The passage states the Russians achieved this (""Russia masha ni gaw jet pyenli hpe ga kaw na gau mai hkra galaw sai""). It's a *success*, not a difficulty they were facing *during* the operation.
* **D: Ayen na myit jasat bai lu ai lam** (Recovering previous mental attitude): The passage states ""pyenli daru a myit masa lam hpe mi na hku bai lu la sai"" (recovered the mental state of the pilot as before), which describes an accomplishment, not a problem.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate reflection of the passage's content regarding the difficulties faced during the operation.
"
"Lawu hta tsun da hte maren, ganghkau dabang na lit lamang magam a pandung shadaw gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **C: ganghkau lam hkawm ai lam shangut na**.

Here's why:

* **P** clearly states ""...lamu hpungtang hkawm sa ai lam ngut du hkra shi a sat lawat hpe hkang zing lai wa sai re."" This translates to ""...he controlled his trajectory until the space walk ended."" This means the primary goal is to complete the spacewalk.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: pyenli n leng lau hkra makawp ya ai hkringrai hpe tam na** (To find the device that protects against uncontrolled rotation of the plane) While mentioned in the passage, it states this *device was removed*. Therefore, finding it is not the current focus.
* **B: jet jak kanawng n-gun gram lajang ai de nyi kahtep na** (To focus on repairing the jet engine) This is a task being performed, but not the *primary goal* of the overall mission.
* **D: jet pyenli hpe gau mai hkra galaw ai lam** (To make the jet airplane controllable) This is also a task completed, but not the main objective of the spacewalk itself.
"
lawu kaw na gara gaw dai mabyin hte seng nna n jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Mungkan kumpyuta hkridun galaw lajang ya ai na dap daju ai mungdaw hta dai hpe tara jun wa sai** (Translation: It was prosecuted in the state where the world computer hub is headquartered).

Here's why:

* The passage states Virginia was the location of the prosecution because it was the ""home of the world's first computer anti-spam company"" (roughly translated). It DOES NOT say Virginia is where the *headquarters* of the entire ""world computer hub"" is. This is a subtle but important distinction.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: mara dam hpe galaw lai wa sai** (Translation: A fine/penalty was levied) - The passage explicitly states a ""fine"" (mara dam) was received.
* **C: spam email hte seng nna upadi ka lajang ai lam hpe dai mabyin hta jai lang wa sai** (Translation: Legislation regarding spam email was used in this incident) - The passage mentions the 2003 law passed to combat spam emails was used.
* **D: Mungkan kumpyuta hkridun galaw lajang ya ai hpe tara jun ai lam galaw sai** (Translation: The world computer hub was prosecuted) - The passage states the ""company"" (roughly translated) pioneering in the anti-spam field was prosecuted, which is related to the ""world computer hub.""

Therefore, only option A misrepresents the information provided in the passage.
"
mabyin hpe lawu na gara gaw tup hkrak lu tsun dan ai rai?,"The best answer is **A: AOL hpe n ra sharawng ai dut shabra ai hte seng nna tara jun sai** (AOL was prosecuted for unsolicited distribution).

Here's why:

* **The passage is specifically about Virginia prosecuting someone (AOL) for sending unwanted emails (spam).**  The passage focuses on the legal action taken against AOL for distributing unsolicited materials.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: mabyin hta mungkan kumpyuta hkridun galaw lajang ya ai lam ningshawng shapraw ya ai lahkawng lawm ai** (The event involved two pioneers in the development of the World Wide Web).  While the passage mentions AOL is a pioneer in technology, the focus is on the spam case, not necessarily *two* pioneers and the *development of the web* specifically.
* **C: 2003 hta mabyin dai hpe tara jun sai** (The event was prosecuted in 2003).  The passage mentions the 2003 law, but it's about *using* that law for the first time, not necessarily the date of the prosecution itself. The prosecution likely happened *after* the law was passed.
* **D: AOL gaw mabyin hpe tara jun ai lam galaw hpang wa ai** (AOL initiated the prosecution of the event). This is the *opposite* of what happened. AOL was the *target* of the prosecution, not the initiator.

Therefore, option A most accurately reflects the core information conveyed in the passage.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Vidal gaw gara hpung a matu lai wa sai ladaw masum hta ginsup hpang wa sai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Barça**.

The passage states: ""Asak 28 ning kaba ai Vidal gaw lai wa sai shata masum hta Sevilla kaw na **Barca** de shang lai wa sai re."" This translates to ""28-year-old Vidal joined **Barca** from Sevilla three months ago."" Therefore, he started playing for Barça in the last three months.
"
Vidal gaw Barça a matu game kade ram ginsup ya sai rai?,"The correct answer is A: 49

The passage states: ""Catalan mare ninghpum de htawt sit wa ai kaw na Vidal gaw ginsup hpung a matu ginsup poi 49 hpe ginsup lai wa sai re.""  This translates to: ""Since moving to the Catalan club, Vidal has played 49 games for the team.""

Therefore, the answer is A.
"
shingjawng lamang hta kadai gaw ninghkap ginsup uhpung rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**.

The passage states that Jarque's team will compete against Bolonia on Sunday. Therefore, Bolonia is the opposing team.
"
Jarque gaw hpa majaw manam dap kaw nga taw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: shi hta Laban shani shingjawng poi nga majaw**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Shi gaw laban shana Bolonia hte shingjawng na lamang galaw na shara a shawng kaw na manam jarik kaw nga taw ai re."" This directly translates to: ""He was at the training camp ahead of Saturday's game against Bologna.""

The other options are not directly supported by the text:

* **A: shi hta shaman shakyang ai nga majaw (because he has training):**  While training is mentioned, the reason he's at *this particular* training camp (manam jarik) *now* is the upcoming game.
* **B: shi hta ladaw-shawng hkrum zup hpawng nga majaw (because he has a pre-season meeting):** Not mentioned in the text.
* **D: shi gaw Bolonia hte shaman shakyang taw majaw (because he is training with Bologna):**  The passage states he is playing *against* Bologna, not training with them.
"
Jakarta gingding hkrang jasat hpaji kasa dap gaw hpa majaw sadi jaw ai lam nshapru ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: n-nang nawn byin na ra ai magnitude de n du ai**.

The passage states: ""Jakarta a ginding hkrang hpaji hpung ni tsun ai gaw, tsunami nbung laru sadi lam hpe nshapraw da ai hpa majaw nga yang nnang nawn shangun na magnitude 6.5 ndu ai majaw re."" This directly translates to the Jakarta geophysical agency not issuing a tsunami warning because the magnitude did not reach 6.5.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, n-nang nawn a majaw hpa baw byin ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: hkrit tsang taw ai buga masha ni**.

The passage says the lack of a tsunami warning was because the earthquake's magnitude didn't reach 6.5. The passage then states, ""Tsunami a jahkrit ai lam nnga timung, masha ni gaw grai hkrit nna bungli ni hte nta ni hpe kabai da kau ma ai."" This translates to ""Even though there was no tsunami threat, people were very scared and abandoned their jobs and homes."" This clearly shows that the result of the lack of warning (due to the magnitude) was scared local people.
"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Jan hte kaga shagan ni yawng a bungli galaw ai lam hpe sharawt ya ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: gayin ai lam hte htoi tu ai lam**

Here's why:

*   **P states**: ""Gawda hkrang kata na shagan yawng a bungli galaw ai lam gaw shanhte a htoi tu ai lam, shanhte a gayin ai lam ni a gau hkang hkrum ai lu matu re ai hte laga hpa nre ai lam hpe mu lai wa sai re.""
*   **Translation:** ""They have seen that all the processes of the stars in the galaxy are to obtain the control of their brightness and their rotation and nothing else.""

This sentence explicitly says that the processes of stars (including the Sun and other stars) are driven by their brightness (htoi tu ai lam) and rotation (gayin ai lam)."
shagan na Rossby nambat hpe gara hku daw dan ai rai?,"The passage states: ""Htoi tu ai lam hte gayin ai lam ni hpe gaw dat yi,la n-gun bung dat nsa masa hte seng nga ai shata langai a Rossby nambat hpe myit sawn jep jen ai lam hta arau sha jai lang ai re.""

This directly translates to: ""The brightness and the rotation are used together in calculating the Rossby number of a star that depends on gravity, magnetic field, and mass composition.""

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **B: dat yi, la n-gun bung dat nsa lwi ai madang** (gravity, magnetic field, and mass composition). Though brightness and rotation are *used* in the calculation, the Rossby number *depends* on these other factors. B captures the essence of what the Rossby number is related to.
"

The passage states that ""tsa lam shadang 29 gaw Australia gaw mai byin ai daram lawan nna gumsan magam mungdan byin grin ai ngu kam nga ma ai"" which translates to ""29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible.""
"
"Julie Gillard tsun ai hku, Australia gaw galoi gumsan magam mungdan byin gying ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Elizabeth II Hkaw Hkam Num na hkaw dung ngut ai hpang**.

The passage states: ""Chyahkring mi na Hkringmang Daju Julia Gillard gaw shaning 2010 na federal ra lata poi a campaign laman hta shi kam ai gaw Elizabeth II Hkaw Hkam Num a up hkang ai ten jahtum hta Australia gaw gumsan magam mungdan byin ai nga nna ndau shana ga ai."" This translates to ""The then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.""
"
Gara hpung kaba gaw tara hte seng ai san jep sagawn ai lam kaw rai taw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Masing nga Kanu Kawa prat**.

The passage states that the Komen Foundation's policy is not ""targetted to Planned Parenthood"" and that Planned Parenthood's funds were being investigated, indicating they were the subject of scrutiny.
"
Cliff Stearns gaw gara komti na ningbaw rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Dat n-gun rung hte hpaga yumga Komti**.

The passage states: ""Stearns gaw dat n-gun rung hte hpaga yumga komti hpung a npu kaw na re"" which translates to ""Stearns is from the Energy and Commerce Committee"".
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, Swiss num hta hpa n byin mat ai rai?","The passage states: ""Anhte ni Swimm num wa hpe roi kau ai masha manga hpe rim tawn da sai re nna shi a phone hte lang hkawm mai ai kompyuta hpe bai lu la sai re."" This translates to: ""We have arrested the five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her phone and laptop.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Shi na lagu la da hkrum ai gunrai ni bai lu la ai** (She got her stolen items back)
"
2007 Taiwan Sustainable kumhpa hpe gara hpaga hpung lu mat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The first sentence of the prompt states that ASUS received the 2007 Taiwan Sustainable Award from the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China.
"
ASUS Eee PC ngu ai hpa rai?,"The passage states that the ASUS Eee PC was a popular device at the Taipei IT month in 2007 and was comparable to laptops, although it received the Taiwan Sustainable Award from the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China.

Given that the context mentions the Eee PC in relation to laptops and its appearance at an IT event, the most logical answer is:

**B: laptop**

While option C, ""hpawngtin hte madi lang ai kompyuta kaji"" (small computer used for meeting or communication), could be a possible interpretation, the passage is specifically mentioning it in the context of laptop computers. Therefore, laptop is a more fitting answer.
"
Laika pa mat ai hte seng nna kadai kaw lit nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Laika sa ai bungli masha ni (Mail delivery workers)**

The passage states that the problem arose because 429 out of 600 undelivered letters from the postal office were New Year's cards. This indicates a failure on the part of the mail delivery workers to deliver the mail properly.
"
"Laika pa mat ai hte seng nna, kadai hpyi nem ga tsun dat sai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Obanazawa laika rung**.

The passage states that the Obanazawa Post Office (Obanazawa Laika Shagun Rung) investigated the lost mail and issued an apology. Therefore, they are the ones who apologized for the missing New Year's cards.
"
Del Potro gaw shi na lata lahpa ana hte seng nna galoi tsi wa sai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Shawng ningnan lang n'jahkring shi shaloi**.

The passage says, ""Del Potro gaw daw lahkawng ginsup hpang ai shaloi loi grau hkrak taw ai raitim, 6-6 masat du ai shaloi gan jahkring kau ra ai. Potro gaw ndai kalang lata hta ana tsi wa sai re..."". This means Potro's hand injury acted up when he had to take a break at 6-6 in the second set. Therefore, it was before he had to take the break, that is ""Shawng ningnan lang n'jahkring shi shaloi"", that he realized his hand was getting injured.
"
Shawng ningnan pang na mahtai gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **A: shawng ningnan pang kaw Murray sum mat ai**.

The passage clearly states that Murray lost the first set after being broken in each set. The other options are either incorrect or not directly supported by the provided text.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, machyi masha hte kahtep ai wa gaw kadai rai?","The answer is **B: ma ni**.

The text states, ""dai ni gaw jawng lung nga ai ma ni hku nna ndai machyi masha hte hkrum hkra ai lam nga ma ai hpe chye lu ai"", which translates to ""today we know that there are students going to school who have encountered this sick person.""
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, Texas buga masha ni hpe ginwang du gaw kaning re ga sadi n jaw wa sai rai?","The correct answer is **A: ladat gaw atsawm sha bungli galaw taw ai lam**.

The passage states that the governor said, ""Ngam ai hte gaw byin ging ai hte maren anhte lai ladat gaw bungli byin taw ai re,"" which translates to ""The remaining process is working as it should."" This is a promise or affirmation that the system/process is functioning effectively.

While B and C are touched on in the passage, they are not presented as direct promises made by the governor. D is incorrect because the governor actually said that it isn't a bad incident.
"
UW jawng ma dingsa lahkawng gaw kaning re shatu shakra ai laika hpe hpan wa sai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Onion**.

The passage states that Heck and Johnson, while students at UW in 1988, envisioned creating a satirical publication that became The Onion.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw Onion chyhpyak shiga hkawseng hta n lawm ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: sumla hkrung**.

The passage mentions:

*   Shapraw ai laika (Printed paper)
*   Website
*   Our Dumb World (which implies a world atlas type of content, although not explicitly stated)

It does *not* mention sumla hkrung (cartoons/animations).
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, hpa hpe pyada makawp maga da sai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Downing lam chyinghka lam**.

The passage states the protesters were ""heading towards Downing Street, the official residence of the Prime Minister, on Whitehall, to meet the police cordon."" This indicates that the police cordon was protecting Downing Street.
"
Galoi ten hta pyada ni gaw ninghkap ni hpe mawdaw hting let ai lam n nga na matu htawt na hku tsun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: hking 11:20 hta**.

The text states ""Aten 11:20 hta dai masha ni hpe lam makau de sit na matu tsun wa ai... "", which translates to ""At 11:20 they were told to move to the side of the road...""
"
Dr. Ehud Ur galaw wa sai sawk sagawn magam hte seng nna gara gaw jaw ai rai?,"Let's analyze the provided text (P) and the question (Q) to determine the correct answer.

The text states:

*   Dr. Ehud Ur is a medical professional at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
*   He is involved with the Canadian Diabetes Association.
*   His research is still in its early stages.
*   Like others, he's skeptical about claims of curing diabetes and believes these findings are not relevant to people with Type 1 diabetes (hkang 1 sai dwi ann lu ai masha ni).

The question asks what is true about Dr. Ehud Ur's research.

Let's examine the answer choices:

*   **A: Dai mahtai gaw amyu langai Type 1 jit dwi ana machyi masha ni a matu akyu jaw na lam (The answer will benefit Type 1 diabetes patients.)** This contradicts the text, which says Dr. Ur believes the findings are *not* relevant to people with Type 1 diabetes.
*   **B: Nkau jit dwi ana kap ai yu ni gaw ya jit dwi ana n kap mat sai lam (Some diabetic mice are no longer diabetic.)** This is mentioned in the first sentence of the text (Shi kahtap tsun ai gaw, ""anhte hta lai sai ten hta sai dwi ana nga ai shata 4 re ai yu ni gaw ya ten sai dwi ana nnga taw sai."").
*   **C: Shi gaw dai mu chye ai ni gaw tsi lajang ai lam de rai wa na re ngu kaja ai myit ningmu masa nga ai (He has a positive outlook that the findings will lead to a cure.)** This is the opposite of what the text says. He is skeptical.
*   **D: Nkau jit dwi ana n kap ai yu ni gaw ya jit dwi ana kap wa ai (Some non-diabetic mice have now become diabetic.)** This is not mentioned or implied in the provided text.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B**."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, Dr. Ur n kam sham ai hpa rai?","Based on the provided text, Dr. Ur does not believe:

* **B: tsi lajang na lam mai byin ai** (that a cure is possible)

The text states: ""Laga ninghkring ni zawn, shi mung sai dwi ann hpe mai tsi ai hpe nkam ai"" which translates to ""Like other colleagues, he does not believe a cure for diabetes is possible.""
"
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, nblungli CG4684 hten hkrat ai lam hte seng nna tup hkrak n lu tsun dan ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: N hten za shi shaloi nblungli gaw ga de yu na matu masum lang shakut yu sai** (Before crashing, the plane tried to land three times).

Here's why:

*   The passage states the plane attempted to land *twice*: ""Shi yu ra aten hta minit shi jau nna *lahkawng* lang ngu na yu wa na matu shakut nga ai shaloi mat mat ai re.""

Let's examine why the other options are not accurate:

*   **A: lamu marang masa a majaw nblungli gaw madung kaw na n lu yu ai** (Because of the weather the plane couldn't land at the primary place): The passage states weather conditions are unfavorable and impacted search efforts.
*   **B: grai tsan ai shara gaw nblungli gaw hten za mat ai** (The plane crashed in a very far place): The passage mentions the remote location but does not explicitly connect that to the cause of the crash.
*   **D: nblungli hten za lam sawk sagaw dap gaw lamu marang a majaw hkra machyi sai** (The plane crash investigation team was impacted because of the weather): The passage mentions that the weather is hindering search and rescue efforts.

Therefore, option C is the only one that contradicts the provided information."
Nblungli CG4684 yu na matu dawm kau ai gaw hpa majaw rai?,"The correct answer is **D: lamu marang masa gaw n hkrak taw ai (the weather was not good)**.

The passage mentions, ""Lamu marang nkaja ai hte hpawn yu wa yak ai lam byin hkrum hkra ai majaw sawk tam ai lam hpe hkum shingdang kau ra ai."" This translates to ""Because of the bad weather and the difficulty in landing, the search was suspended."" This directly indicates the weather was a factor in the landing being aborted and subsequent issues.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw Franciszek Kowal na mahkrum madup hte seng nna n jaw ai rai?","Let's analyze the given passage (P) and the options:

*   **P: Translation:** ""Even though nothing happened to me, I clearly saw people digging tunnels to let the dead people come out of the gates. Even though people were destroying the tunnel barriers with shovels, the tunnel doors did not break. 'Finally, one barrier fell and they started coming out of the tunnels,' said survivor Franciszek Kowal.""

Now let's evaluate the options:

*   **A: Shi gaw hku wawt hpe tawt lai jahten kau lu sai (He was able to break through the tunnels):** The passage says that people were trying to destroy the barriers with shovels, but the tunnel doors did not break at first. It later mentions one barrier fell. This *could* be interpreted as he was part of the effort but it doesn't explicitly state he was the person who made it happen.

*   **B: Shi gaw dik shale hkala nba n hkrum ai (He did not suffer any serious injuries):** The passage says ""nothing happened to me,"" so this statement is true based on the passage.

*   **C: Shi pru na matu shakut ai shaloi lahkum daw kau ai (The shovel broke when he tried to get out):** The passage mentions shovels being used to destroy the barriers, not necessarily to get out. This could be a misinterpretation.

*   **D: Shi hku wawt hpe jahten na matu shakut ai shaloi hkala la ai (He was injured while trying to destroy the tunnels):** The passage says ""nothing happened to me,"" which means he wasn't injured.

The question asks which statement is **not true** based on the passage. Options B and D are stated directly in the passage. Options A and C require more interpretation, but after considering the passage and all options, only option D is explicitly contradictory to the passage.

**Therefore, the correct answer is D.**
"
Kahtet mungkan daw hte seng ai nbung laru a byin wa na akyu kaba hpe shadawn na matu yak ai rai?,"The passage states: ""Dai nbung laru gaw ga galapran taw ai hte tsan taw ai majaw shi gaw United State dai nrai Caribbean de shang na amtu yak taw ai re.""  This translates to ""The storm is far and scattered, making it difficult for it to enter the United States or the Caribbean.""

The question ""Kahtet mungkan daw hte seng ai nbung laru a byin wa na akyu kaba hpe shadawn na matu yak ai rai?"" asks why it's hard to predict the storm's ultimate impact. The passage answers this by saying it's scattered and far away.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: laru gaw ga galapran taw ai hte tsan ai** (The storm is far and scattered).
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw kahtet mungkan daw hte seng nna n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Caribbean kaw byin na dai laru a akyu kaba hpe n chye ai** (The importance of the storm occurring in the Caribbean is unknown).

Here's why:

*   **B: dai laru gaw Atlantic Pang lai kaw na byin pru wa ai** (The storm originated in the Atlantic Ocean): The text explicitly states the storm originated east of the Atlantic.

*   **C: dai laru gaw laru kaba de gale mai ai** (The storm could turn into a hurricane): The text says experts predict it could strengthen into a hurricane.

*   **D: Ga galapran taw ai hte tsan ai** (Dispersed and distant): The text states the storm is far from land, making landfall unlikely.

*   **A: Caribbean kaw byin na dai laru a akyu kaba hpe n chye ai** (The importance of the storm occurring in the Caribbean is unknown): The text does not say that is it not known how much the storm will effect the Caribbean, just that the storm will likely not go to the Caribbean.

Therefore, only option A is not supported by the information in the text."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, mungkan zinli n byin shi yang ana ahkya hte gara tang madun da ai gaw byin na rai?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: si shangun ai lam yawm wa na** and **B: ana kumla ni nau n'madun na**.

The passage states that before a global pandemic, the virus would likely become less deadly (""ana zinli gaw si shangun lu ai lam yawm mat ra ai re"") and that people might not show obvious symptoms (""Mak hkalawng ana kumla nau n madun shi yang"").  This corresponds directly to options A and B.

Therefore, both **A** and **B** are accurate and supported by the text. There is no single best option here.

**Important Note:** It's unusual for a multiple-choice question to have two correct answers. It's possible the question is poorly worded or there is additional context missing. If you are being graded on this, clarify with the instructor which answer they consider the *most* correct, if any.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, bungga laru gaw Fujian hte kade ram tsan ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: 70 kilometer**.

The text states ""...Morakot jak a myi gaw Miwa a Fujian ginwang kaw kilometer sanit shi tsan ai share du lai wa ai re"" which translates to ""...the eye of Typhoon Morakot passed 70 kilometers away from Fujian province, China.""
"
Asia de George W.Bush sa du ai shaloi kadai hkap tau ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Ningtau Hkringmang Daju**.

The passage states that George W. Bush was greeted by ""Singapore mungdan a ningtau hkringmang daju Wong Kan Seng,"" which translates to ""Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng."" While he also met with the Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong, the question specifically asks who greeted him upon arrival.
"
Asia hpaga yumnga dam lada lam a matu gumsan galoi shaga wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Shi na midterm ra lata poi machyi sum ngut ai hpang**.

The passage states: ""Midterm ra lata poi hta sum ai bat myi na mat ai hpang, Bush gaw lamang washa masha ni hpe Asia dan a hpaga yumga kaba jat wa ai lam hte seng nna tsun dan lai sai."" This translates to: ""After losing the Midterm elections, Bush spoke to the program participants about the increasing economic importance of Asian countries.""

Therefore, the timeframe during which the president spoke to people about Asia's economic growth was *after* the midterm elections.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw asuya a pandung shadaw rai?","The correct answer is **D: masha htaw leng chyat ai lam hpe shanem na** (reduce the number of passenger vehicles).

The passage states the government announced they would be **reducing** the number of passenger vehicles by March of this year.  This directly supports the idea of reducing the vehicle fleet. Options A, B, and C are incorrect as the passage does not state the government's goal is to increase or maintain the number of passenger vehicles.
"
Asuya gaw hpa hpe ndau shabra wa sai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: bungjat 300 masha htaw leng na matu jahpan lajang da sai lam**.

The passage states: ""Dai ni na asuya a ndai shaning march shata hta jahpan grau jahkrat na matu lagaw sa wa na ngu tsun ai lam hpe mung ndau shana lai wa sai re. Dai hta nna masha htaw ai 1,300 kaw na 300 hpe bai lu la wa sai re.""

This translates to: ""Today, the government announced that they will be taking steps to further reduce costs by March of this year. Because of this, 300 of the 1,300 passenger vehicles have been recovered.""

This implies that the government announced a plan to acquire/arrange for 300 passenger vehicles (bungjat 300 masha htaw leng na matu jahpan lajang da sai lam).
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, gara shiga gaw chye ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Jahkrit shama ai lam shayawm kau sai**

The passage states that although the threat may have decreased, it doesn't mean it has disappeared. This implies that there is still a threat, but it's less than it was before. Therefore, A is the most accurate reflection of the passage's meaning.
"
ninghkap ai ni hte seng nna lawu kaw na gara n jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Aten lai mat ai rea lata poi gaw ninhkap ai lam hpe byin shangun ai** (A delayed or unfair election process caused the protests).

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that the protests stemmed from problems in the election process (""Kalang lang dawsa ai hku ninghkap ai lam gaw ra lata lamang hpe jum tek ai hta hkrat sum shangun ai a npawt re shangun ai"").
*   The phrase ""ra lata lamang hpe jum tek ai hta hkrat sum shangun ai"" indicates issues with the conduct or fairness of the elections, which likely fueled the anti-regime protests.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: gumsan magam hte seng ai lit lamang gaw ninghkap ai ni na matu mahtai re (The President's policies were the answer for the protesters):** The passage implies the opposite – the protesters were against the regime.
*   **C: shawng na CEP pru mat na matu ninghkap ai ni ra sharawng ai (The protesters wanted the previous CEP to leave):** The passage states that the presidential commission dismissed the previous CEP ""to allow the country to move forward,"" but doesn't say that the protesters specifically demanded this. The protesters were against the regime because of election issues.
*   **D: ninghkap ai ni gaw kalang marang gumshem ai (The protesters were repeatedly bribed):** There is nothing in the given text that indicates the protesters were paid, bribed or involved in corruption."
Hpang jahtum CEP pru na lam kadai tang shawn ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: gumsan magam hte seng ai uhpung**.

The passage states: ""Lai wa sai shata shaloi e, **gumsan magam komishin** gaw shawng na CEP hkring sa na lam hpe mungdan hpe shawng de rawt jat hkawm sa lu na matu shalawm da ai."" This translates to ""Last month, the **presidential commission** announced the dissolution of the previous CEP to allow the country to move forward.""

The presidential commission is the one who initiated the dissolution of the previous CEP, leading to the need for a new one.
"
Ginsup ninghkrin ni hpe Nassar shoi maroi roi rip ai hpang USA Gymnastic hku na madi shadaw n'galaw ya ai gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **B: galaw ahkang jaw ai grup yin masa hpe hpan da ya na** (creating an environment that enables abuse).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that USA Gymnastics supports reforms to expose the abuse perpetrated by Larry Nassar. This implies that the existing environment within the organization was conducive to abuse, or at least did not prevent it.
*   The passage criticizes the USOC and implies that merely removing ceremonial markings (like medals) is insufficient. It suggests a deeper, more meaningful change is needed within the organization.
*   The passage stresses on galai shai ra ai lam ni which includes that making the environment safe and positive for athletes is USA Hkum mun ginsup lam's goal. This will address the environment or 'galaw ahkang jaw ai grup yin masa' that had enabled abusive acts.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

*   **A: masat shagrau ai hpe la kau ya na** (taking away recognition): While removing medals is mentioned, the passage implies this is a superficial action and not a solution to the underlying problem.
*   **C: hpung kaba kata hta galai shai ra ai lam ni** (changes needed within the large group): Though related, this option is too general. It focuses on the fact that changes are needed, but not on exactly what kind of changes will prevent future abuse.
*   **D: Wanglu wanglang sawk sagawn lu na** (ability to investigate freely): While investigation is related, it is not the direct reason that gymnasts did not receive support after being sexually assaulted by Nassar.

"
"Laika hta tsun ai hku, USA Gymnastic hte United State Olympic Komiti a matut nna galaw wa na madung pandung gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **D: ginsup ninghkring ni a matu shim lam nga ai grup yin masa hpe sharawt na** (create a safe environment for athletes).

The passage states: ""USA Hkum mun ginsup lam hte USOC hta bung ai pandung nga ai - dai gaw hkum mun ginsup lam hte kaga gunsup lam ni hpe ginsup ninghkring ni matu mai byin ai daram shimlum hkra, kaja ai hte makau grup yin myit n-gun shajat ya na matu galaw hkyen da ma ai re.""  This directly translates to: ""USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal - that is to work to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible for athletes, creating a positive and supportive environment."" This aligns perfectly with option D.
"
Dai mabyin byin ai shaloi sanghpaw gaw gara de sa taw ai rai? ,"Based on the passage, the Avenger class mine countermeasures ship were going to Palawan, specifically Puerto Princesa.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: Palawan**
"
Laika hta tsun da ai dai sanghpaw hte seng nna gara gaw n jaw ai rai?,"The incorrect statement about the ship in the text is **B: Sanghpaw gaw Palawan kaw dap jung ai**.

Here's why:

*   The text states the ships are *heading to* Puerto Princesa in Palawan, not that they are based there.
*   The other options are supported by the text:
    *   A: Sanghpaw gaw Puerto Princesa de sa taw ai - (The ship is heading to Puerto Princesa) - True based on the text.
    *   C: Sanghpaw gaw bawm ninghkap masing ai baw re - (The ship is a mine countermeasures vessel) - True because it's an ""Avenger class mine countermeasures"" ship.
    *   D: Sanghpaw gaw U.S Hka hpyen dap ai sanit lang na Fleet na matu lit jaw da ai - (The ship is assigned to the U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet) - True because the ship is going to be assigned to the Seventh Fleet.

Therefore, the only false statement is that the ship is based in Palawan."
US hpung hte seng nna kadai gaw shana ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**.

The passage explicitly states that US President Donald Trump announced the news.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, bawng masha ning hkap ai ni hpe sin na matu lit nga ai lam gara mung gaw myit la ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: U Magwi**.

Here's why:

The passage doesn't mention ""U Magwi"" directly. The question is designed to test if you're paying close attention to the details of the passage.
"
Pyenli hkrat ai lam gaw hpa majaw rai?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: hpyen wa gap hpang ai majaw**.

The passage states that the fighting intensified in the mountains, and it is believed that **""dai gaw hpyen wa gap hpang dat ai kaw na byin hpang ai ngu kam ma ai""** which translates to **""that started from the enemy initiating the shooting.""**
"
Kaning re lamu ga kaw pyenli hkrat mat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: bumring bumrang law ai shara kaw**.

The passage states: ""Majan gaw bum mayan hkan grau laja laja re wa ai..."" which translates to ""The fighting is intensifying in the mountainous regions..."" This indicates the area is mountainous. Also, ""...nkaja ai lamu marang hte laja lana re ai lamu ga rau hkrum katut lai wa sai"" which means the troops are encountering terrible weather and difficult terrain.

Therefore, the soldiers are likely traversing mountainous terrain.
"
Hka lim ai lam a mahtai hte seng nna tara shang ai ni gaw hpa myit mada da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Zaibru sawng yan ni bai gram lajang na**.

The passage states: ""Hka lim ai hpang hka lung shadang gaw pe loi mi sha lung ai raitim, du ni gaw agre sha kau ai zaibru jang ni ga de shang mat ai hpe bai gram lajang na matu mai galaw na re ngu myit mada nga ai."" This directly translates to: ""Even though the water level only rose a few feet after the dam, officials hope to be able to repair the beaver dams that were swept away.""

Therefore, option A is the best answer, as it directly reflects what the officials hope to do in response to the dam's effects.
"
namhpai gaw gap ai gaw gara ni hpe tut nawng hkra machyi ai rai?,"All the options are impacted by the dam construction. However, the question asks who is **directly and permanently** affected.  Let's break it down:

*   **A: Zaibru sawng yan ni:** The passage explicitly mentions the reeds being pushed onto land and the hope that they can be restored. This is a direct impact.
*   **B: Humpback chub nga myu ni:** The passage mentions this fish species has disappeared. This is a direct impact.
*   **C: Dusat ni nga na shara:** The passage mentions the ponds being animal habitats. The loss of ponds would impact animals. This is a direct impact.
*   **D: Hkumpup ni hpyan mat wa ai lam:** The passage mentions the importance of the ponds which relates to this answer. This is a direct impact.

Based on the passage, the most accurate answer is **Zaibru sawng yan ni and Humpback chub nga myu ni and Dusat ni nga na shara and Hkumpup ni hpyan mat wa ai lam**, since all the options are stated as being affected.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, United State hpe byin wa na htim gasat na lam hpe kadai ni tsun ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Somali ladu lai myit jasat rawng ai ni**.

The passage states: ""United States sumtsan salang rung gaw Kenya, Nairobi hta shara shahkrat da ai re nna, Kenya hte Ethiopia kaw sat si bawm kabaw na mahkyen hkyen nga ma ai nga """"""""Somalia na sa dik ai ni"""""""" ngu ai sadi jaw ai lam hpe tsun shapraw da sai."" This translates to: ""The United States embassy stationed in Nairobi, Kenya, issued a warning that """"""""Somalia's extremists"""""""" were planning attacks in Kenya and Ethiopia.""
"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw ladu lai myit jasat rawng ai uhpung ni a htim gasat na masing hpe tup hkrak tsun lu ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: mung lahkawng na hkik hkam ai lamu ga shara ni hta bawm kapaw na**.

The passage states: ""Ethiopia hte Kenya kaw nga ai """"""""gumhkawng hkik hkam ai lamu ga shara ni"""""""" hpe kapaw na lam..."" which translates to ""to attack """"""""prosperous/significant locations"""""""" in Ethiopia and Kenya...""

Therefore, the plan is to attack significant locations in **two countries** (Ethiopia and Kenya).
"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw tara kasa n rai ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Makis Triantafylopoulos**.

The passage states that Makis Triantafylopoulos is a journalist (""shiga laika sara""). The other three names are explicitly identified as lawyers (""tara kasa"") or connected to legal work.
"
Lawu kaw na gara uhpung gaw Greek tara hte seng ai masha hpung kata hta shatan nhkan n hkrum ai rai?,"Based on the provided text, the following groups have faced allegations of corruption and misconduct within the Greek legal system:

*   **Tara agyi ni (Judges):** Evangelos Kalousis, a chief justice, was imprisoned for corruption and bribery.
*   **Tara kasa ni (Lawyers):** Sakis Kechagioglou and George Nikolakopoulos were arrested for political blackmail. Petros Mantouvalos, a member of parliament and lawyer, was accused of illegal activities and blackmail.
*   **Tara rung kasa ni (Court officials):**The passage mentions generally the rise in allegations against the officials.

The passage focuses on problems within the Greek legal system including allegations against tara agyi ni (Judges), tara rung kasa ni (Court officials), and tara kasa ni (Lawyers), but does not mention the shiga jaw ai ni (News reporters/Journalists) being implicated. Therefore, the answer must be C.

**Therefore, the correct answer is C: Shiga jaw ai ni**
"
Kala mung gaw wicket shadung kade shamat kau ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

The passage states: ""Kaning rai tim, ningbaw wa a wicket shadung sum mat ai shaloi Kala gaw 36 lang sha lu nna **wicket 7 sum mat ai**."" This directly tells us Kala lost 7 wickets.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, madang tsaw dik ai masat gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **A: lagat 70**.

The passage states: ""Robin Uthappa gaw bawlung 41 hpe 11 lang hte 2 lang gayet nna 70 lu lagat nna madang tsaw htum ai masat hpe lu galaw lai wa sai."" This translates to ""Robin Uthappa scored 70 runs off 41 balls with 11 fours and 2 sixes, setting the highest score.""
"
"Lawu kaw na gara wa gaw, Adam Cuerden a pawt sindawng byin ningpawt n re ai rai?","The passage states that Adam Cuerden was angry because the ""Wale person"" lied about the deletion of their Wiki account. The passage also mentions frustration with them not listening and pretending to be ignorant. Finally, it mentions the anger about the legal ramifications regarding ""gang"" material.

Let's look at the options:

*   **A: Ngang hte seng nna dai ginra a ningnan hkrang tara (New legal framework regarding ""gang"" material):** The passage mentions this as a *result* of the anger in the community, not a cause of Adam Cuerden's anger.
*   **B: Wale shingni hpaji hpe shaprai kau ya ai (Deletion of the Wale account):** The passage mentions this was the initial incident. The lying about it made Adam angry.
*   **C: Wale masha ni n'madat ya ai lam (The Wale person not listening):** The passage states Adam was mad about this
*   **D: Shingni hpaji hpe shaprai kau ya ai ningpawt hte seng nna masu ai lam (Lying about the reason for the account deletion):** The passage clearly states the lying made him angry.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Ngang hte seng nna dai ginra a ningnan hkrang tara** because the new legal framework was a consequence of the widespread anger, not a cause of Adam Cuerden's initial anger."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, dai shara kaw na hpa hpe shaprai kau ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Dinghkrai-madu shiga dap**.

The passage states ""Uphkang du Adam Cuerden gaw lai wa sai shata hta shi **Wiki shiga dap** hte shaga ai lam hpe shaprai kau ya ai lam a ntsa...""  ""Wiki shiga dap"" translates to ""Wiki news outlet"" or ""Wiki news service,"" which aligns with the concept of an independent or ""dinghkrai-madu"" (independent) news outlet.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara hpe Amir Khan madi shadaw ai lam n'nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Olampik hta htawng hkat ai lamang hta num ni lawm wa ai lam**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Amir Khan said he doesn't think women should be boxing.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   B: The passage explicitly states he supports British competitors in the Olympics.
*   C: The passage explicitly states he does not support the idea of women being boxers.
*   D: The passage mentions he would go to London for the Olympics.

"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, Amir Khan gaw shi ningmu hpe nyet kau nna lawu kaw na gara hpe madi shadaw na rai?","The correct answer is **C: 2012 Olampik**.

The passage states: ""shi tsun ai gaw shi gaw London kaw hkyen sa wa na shaning 2012 a Olympics hta British hpe ninghkap shing jawng na ni hpe karum madi shadaw sa na ngu tsun ai.""  This directly indicates his support for the 2012 Olympics.
"
Peter Lenz galoi si mat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: tsirung hta** (at the hospital).

The text states that Lenz was taken to the local hospital, *where he died*.
"
Xavier Zayat gaw kadai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: kaga shingjawng ai wa** (another competitor).

The passage states that Peter Lenz ""adawt hkrum ai kaw lawm nna si mat ai...shi hte arau shingjawng ai wa Xavier Zayat hte adawt hkrup ai,"" which translates to Peter Lenz ""died in an accident...he collided with his competitor Xavier Zayat."" This clearly identifies Zayat as another racer.
"
Myit tsang chye ai pyen ai wa gaw kaning re mabyin masa hta pyenli na kata bungli galaw ai lam chye na ai majaw akyu lu na rai?,"The correct answer is **B: lama na shanhte a pyen hkawm ai n ra ai hpe tau hkrau n chye lu ai hkrit myit a n'tsa myit maju jung yang**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Understanding how airplanes work and what to expect during flight can help overcome the fear of the unknown.
* **Option B aligns with this:** If a person is focusing on the fear of the *unknown* elements of flying, then knowing how the plane works (as suggested in the passage) would be beneficial. The knowledge combats the unknown.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A:** This is wrong because understanding the plane's operations will help an anxious flyer regardless of whether they find the fear embarrassing.

*   **C:** Being aware of all the logistics is unlikely to significantly reduce fear.

*   **D:** If the traveler's concerns originate from something unrelated to flight, the workings of the plane won't alleviate their anxiety.
"
"Laika daw hta ninpawt nna, lawu kaw na gara wa gaw manu-hprang maja ai bu hkawm ai wa hku nna hpang jahtum galaw na rai?","The correct answer is **C: bu hkawm hpaga hpung law law na manu hpe shingdaw yu na**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the author compares flight prices from multiple sources (likely travel companies) to find the best deal.

Let's break down why the other options are less ideal:

*   **A: bu hkawm hpaga hpung ni law malawng na jaw na ngu tsun ai kumhpa ni hpe tam na:** While rewards are a bonus, the core of the passage is about comparing prices, not specifically looking for rewards.
*   **B: Pyenli htaw sa magam hte tau hkrau lakmat mari la na:** Booking early might sometimes get a better price, but the passage emphasizes comparing prices across companies.
*   **D: Pyenli htaw sa magam a website hpe jep yu na:** Checking the airline's website is a good step, but it's part of the *comparison* process, not the entire cost-effective travel strategy.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, bu hkawm ai ni hku nna pyenli manu kaja dik ai hpe lu la na matu shawng galaw ra ai gaw hpa rai?","The best answer is **B: internet hpaga hpung law law na manu ni hpe shingdaw yu na**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes comparing prices from different online travel agencies.** The passage states that because there are so many online travel companies, flight prices can vary widely. It recommends comparing search results and then double-checking directly with the airline's website. This directly supports answer B.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Pyenli htaw sa magam a website hpe jep yu na (Checking the airline's website):** While the passage does mention checking the airline's website *after* comparing prices from multiple sources, the *first* step is to compare prices from different internet travel agencies. So it's not the initial action.
* **C: Pyenli htaw sa magam hte tau hkrau lakmat mari la na (Book tickets directly from the airline):** Booking directly is also a step, but not the initial one according to the passage.
* **D: bu hkawm dat kasa hte tau hkrau lakmat mari la na (Book tickets through a travel agent):** The passage doesn't discuss using travel agents.  It focuses on online comparisons.

Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage.
"
Lawan sa ya ai hpe hkan nang na matu manang galoi ra na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Gunrai htaw pyenli hte arung arai ni hpe sa dat yang (Sending the goods via cargo planes)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on speeding up the delivery of goods.** It mentions that companies pay a lot for expedited shipping and that time is valuable.  It then discusses the problem of using company planes versus smaller options, and how customs and unloading can take time when using regular flights (even company ones).
* **The passage suggests bypassing passenger flights altogether.** It mentions the idea of sending goods ""like luggage"" but that passenger flight regulations don't allow shipping cargo without passengers. This highlights the problem, not the solution.
* **The logical solution, based on the passage's intent, is to use cargo flights.** Cargo flights are specifically designed for shipping goods quickly, avoiding the restrictions and delays associated with passenger flights.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Hpaga hpung hku na tinang a pyenli ni hpe akyu nga hkra jai lang yang (Effectively using own flights of companies)** - The passage explains why using company planes *isn't* always the fastest option, due to customs and unloading delays.
* **C: Arung arai ni hpe bu hkawm sawnghpai zaw sa dat yang (Sending the goods like luggage)** - The passage states that existing regulations doesn't allow it.
* **D: Lawan sa ya ai magam hpe hpaga hpung kaba ni jum lang yang (Great company takes care of the expeditious shipping job)** - The passage doesn't state great company has the sole control of the expeditious shipping job.

Therefore, using cargo planes is the most relevant and logical answer based on the provided text."
"Laika daw hta mahta nna, tinang ayan jawn na nbungli hpe lata ai shaloi, lawu kaw na gara hpe ningshawng jaw ra na rai?","Based on the passage (P), the most important factor when choosing a frequent flyer program is:

* **C: Tinang ayan na jawn ai pyen li htaw sa magam** (The airline you frequently fly with).

The passage states that even if you know *which* airlines you frequent, you should understand that the programs differ, and it is more important to join the program of the airline you actually fly most often.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, kadai wa gaw chyahkring hkring bu hkawm amat law law hpe jaw na zawn re rai?","Based on the passage, the answer is **C: alliance n bung ai kaw na tinang ayan jawn ai pyenli**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Nang ayang jawn ai nbungli hpe nang chye la ta tim, shanhte gaw ai lam ni gaw shai ai hpe chye ra ai ngut nna lam langai sha sa ai nbungli nbung ai hta jawn ai ni gaw grau ahkyak ai re.""

This roughly translates to: ""Even if you know your preferred airline, you should know that their routes might be different and those who fly airlines within the same alliance are more important."" Since frequent fliers are those that fly most, they'll tend to be prioritized when booking flights.

Since frequent fliers are more important when booking flights and alliances dictate routes, frequent fliers who fly airlines that are not aligned with alliances are bound to have more problems.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, chyaru tsa ladu shalia lusha ai majaw lawu kaw na gara maju jahten mat ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Na maju** (Sin maju).

The passage states: ""Grau lai nna tsa lu ai lam kaw na aten galu hkamja lam hta byin mai ai mabyin ni kaw gaw **sin hten za ai lam** hte myi nmu mat ai mung lawm nna si hkrum si htan du wa hkra lawm nga ai."" This translates to: ""Potential long-term health effects from excessive drinking include **liver damage**, blindness, and even death.""

Therefore, ""sin hten za ai lam"" directly refers to liver damage, making ""Na maju"" (Sin maju - liver) the correct answer.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw gara gaw chyaru tsa a akyu hpe shayawm kau ya na byin mai rai?","The passage states that drinking illegally produced alcohol increases the risk of negative consequences. This is because illegally produced alcohol can contain dangerous impurities like methanol.

Therefore, the best answer is:

*   **B: Tara nshang ai hku shapru da ai wenyi ni hpe lu ai** (Drinking illegally produced spirits)

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: methanol lawm ai tsa hpe lu ai** (Drinking alcohol containing methanol) - While technically correct as methanol *causes* the harm, option B is broader and encompasses the *source* of the methanol (illegally produced alcohol).
*   **C: tsa hpe ram daw lu na** (Drinking alcohol in moderation) - The passage encourages moderation, not the opposite.
*   **D: masha kaga hte lu na** (Drinking with others) - The passage doesn't address the effect of drinking with other people."
Amsterdam na tsaw dik htum sutgan arung arai ni gaw gara kaw rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Canal Ginwang**.

The passage states that the Canal Ginwang (Dutch: Grachtengordel) is part of Amsterdam's Binnenstad and that its cultural-historical value makes it one of the country's highest-ranked assets.  The question asks where Amsterdam's highest-ranked assets are, and the passage directly identifies the Canal Ginwang.
"
Canal Ginwang hpe hpa majaw UNESCO Mungkan Sali Wunli Shara zawn shalat da ai rai?,"The best answer is **A: shi na labau hte htunghking manu a majaw**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the Canal Ginwang was nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage site because of its ""laklai ai htunghking labau a manu ni"" (unique cultural and historical values). Option A directly reflects this reason.

Let's look at why the other options are not as good:

*   **B: Shi a laklai ai sutgan arung arai ni (Its unique assets):** While the passage mentions assets, it's in the context of those assets representing high cultural and historical value.
*   **C: shi na Binnenstad hpe shinggrup taw ai shara a majaw (Because of the area surrounding the Binnenstad):** The passage focuses on the Canal Ginwang itself, not just the surrounding area.
*   **D: shi na tsaw ai sutgan arung arai manu a majaw (Because of its high asset value):** The passage mentions tsaw dik htum ai sutgan arung arai ni rai nga ai, but this is in the context of laklai ai htunghking labau a manu ni. The reason for becoming a UNESCO Heritage Site is not simply because of its high asset value alone, but the historical and cultural value these assets represent.

Therefore, **A** is the most accurate and direct answer based on the information provided in the passage.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw Phnom Krom de sa du ging ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Tonle Sap ningmu ginra**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that the Phnom Krom temple offers a magnificent view of the Tonle Sap Lake.
*   The passage directly links visiting the area to enjoying the views from Tonle Sap lake.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   B: Angkor Pass hte bu hkawm lu na - the passage mentions that Angkor pass is required for Angkor but not Phnom Krom.

*   C: Siem Reap hpe mu yu na - Siem Reap is the location of Phnom Krom, but it's not a specific reason *to* visit Phnom Krom.

*   D: nawng de li hte hkrun lam kadun sa na - this is possible but not the specific reason to visit.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, Phnom Krom de lu shang na matu bu hkawm ai ni hpa baw ra na rai?","The correct answer is **C: Angkor Pass hpe lu la na (To get Angkor Pass)**.

The passage states: ""Angkor Pass nawku jawng de shang ra ai dai majaw Tonle Sap de sa yang passport la wa na hkum ma lap u."" This translates to ""You need an Angkor Pass to enter the Phnom Krom temple, so don't forget to bring your passport when going to Tonle Sap."" The requirement of having an Angkor Pass is directly stated for accessing the temple.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw mungkan bu hkawm masha ni hku nna Antarctica de sa du yu na matu pat shadang mai ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: masat da ai hkrang shamu shamawt ai lam** (established physical endurance).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that travelers to Antarctica ""hkum hkrang hkam kaja ra ai"" which translates to ""need to be physically healthy."" This implies a level of physical endurance is required and therefore a limiting factor.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: bu hkawm ai hta jailang jahpan jat ai lam** (increasing costs of travel): The passage mentions travelers need ""ja gumhpraw ma ai"" (a lot of money) suggesting it's already expensive, but doesn't explicitly say increasing costs are a barrier.
*   **B: Ross Sea de marai langai sha sa du masam maram na matu myit lawm ai lam** (interest in traveling to the Ross Sea alone): The passage suggests the Ross Sea is a destination, not a reason to be prevented from going.
*   **C: December hte January shata kaw bu hkawm ahkang jaw ai bungli lamang** (travel permission operations in December and January): The passage states Nov-Feb is when travel is permitted, so this is a time window of opportunity, not a restriction."
Bum lung ai kaw myit lawm ai mungkan bu hkawm masha langai hku nna Antartica gara shara de sa du yu na rai?,"The passage states that tourists can visit Zundawn, Zunlawng, and Ross panglai. It also mentions the Antarctika kawng lam (ice sheet) as a place for adventurous air travel or reaching the world's end, especially for climbers.

The question asks where a mountain climbing-interested traveler should visit. Therefore, the best answer is **B: Kawng lam shara**.
"
Prat nau ndep shi ai lamu shagan maram dap de tawn ai byin na masa yawm dik ai shara hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **C: tsan gang ai shara kaw**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that current issues are different than those of the past, where telescopes were in remote locations.
* The passage implies that telescopes in the present are more likely to be found in urban areas or on campuses.
* Therefore, places that are tsan gang ai shara kaw, or remote, would be the *least* likely location for a modern telescope.
"
Prat dep sawk sagawn myihtawn gara kaw tawn da na rai?,"The answer that best aligns with the given passage is **B: Dakkasu wang kaw**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions that current problems are different from those of the past because ""they live in cities and college campuses.""
*   The passage doesn't specifically say that universities *store* the technology. It says the technology is useful in dealing with problems that are now found in cities and college campuses."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw simsa ai panglai hkinggau shani na matu kaja dik rai?","The passage states that Tamaki Drive beaches, located in Waitemata Harbour such as Mission Bay and St Heliers are popular. It also says that swimming there is generally calm.

While all the options are related to beaches mentioned in the passage, only Mission Bay and St Heliers are explicitly described as having calm swimming conditions. Because the question asks for the ""best"" location, and we don't have information to differentiate between Mission Bay and St Heliers in terms of calmness, we need to choose the more specific answer. In this case both St Heliers and Mission Bay are similar in that it is calm.

Therefore, both option A and B can be correct. However, if I am to choose just one, the most reasonable answer to choose is B.

**Final Answer: B**
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, hka hpungyawt masa shim dik ai zawn san ai gara kaw rai?","The passage states: ""...Dai hka hpum yawt mai ai shara ni kaw law malawng zaibru hkrai re, ngut nna pohutukawa hpun hte shanip ni galaw da ya ma ai."" (The places where you can kayak are mostly calm waters, and there are pohutukawa trees and shade provided.) This indicates calm waters are where kayaking is possible.

While the passage mentions Devonport and Long Bay as boundaries, it doesn't explicitly say kayaking is *most* calm there. It only says it's within the Dingdung Sanghpaw daru Ginwang (Northern Ship Region) area. However, the passage mentions that kayaking in the northern ship region is mostly on calm waters.

Therefore, the best answer is:

**B: Dingdung Sanghpaw daru Ginwang** (Northern Ship Region)
"
"Laika hta matsun da ai shara ni hpe sa du yu yang, lawu kaw na gara gaw n’htuk ai ngu sawn la lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: dai shara makau hkan ashit aka da ai**.

Here's why:

*   **P** clearly states that disrespecting the location with graffiti or markings is inappropriate. Leaving trash (like feces) around the site is an even more egregious form of disrespect.
*   The other options align with respecting the site and its history.
"
Lawu kaw na gara wa gaw ga apai ai hpe gawn da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: shachyaw da ai laika**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Auxiliary laika gaw galaw dai ai dai nrai **shachyaw da ai laika** gaw ga chye na hkat na yak taw ai masha lapran hta chye na hkat na matu galaw da ai re.""  This translates to ""Auxiliary language, that is, **a constructed language**, is created to facilitate understanding between people who have difficulty understanding each other.""  Therefore, the passage directly links ""ga apai ai"" (auxiliary language) to ""shachyaw da ai laika"" (constructed language).
"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw auxiliary ga hpe tup hkrak n lu tsun dan ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shanhte gaw shingra tara hku byin pru wa nna shinggyim masha shada da n chye na hkat ai shaloi karum ya na matu jai lang ai ga ni re.**

Here's why:

*   The initial statement explicitly says auxiliary languages are *artificial* (shachyaw da ai dai nrai shachyaw da ai laika gaw).
*   Option A describes them as *natural* (shingra tara hku byin pru wa nna). This directly contradicts the information in the provided text.

The other options are more consistent with the idea of an auxiliary language:

*   B: They can be artificial or natural (while not fully accurate as the text focuses on artificial languages, it's not a direct contradiction).
*   C: Built to improve communication.
*   D: A bridge between speakers of different languages."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, nshung ta hta sanghpaw hte bu hkawm ai rai yang bu hkawm ai ni hku na hpa hpe jep yu ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: sanghpaw yup gawk shara** and **B: mungdan shang lakmat hte seng ai ra rawng ai**

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states to check the ""sanghpaw yup gawk nga shara"" (ship cabin space).
*   It also mentions that passengers need to process ""mungdan shang ahkang lakmat nlang"" (national immigration documents), indicating a need to check the related paperwork.

The other options are not directly mentioned in the text as something passengers *need to check*. ""Ga si ga ngau ni"" (words and phrases) are instructions for you, not something passengers need to check. ""Mare kaba hta aten jahtum na shadang"" (time to spend in the city) is merely information about the tour, not a requirement for passengers.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, ginhtawng ta hta sanghpaw hte bu hkawm ai rai yang, bu hkawm ai ni hpa hpe koi yen lu na rai?","The correct answer is **C: mungdan shang lakmat hte seng ai ra rawng ai**.

The passage states: ""Sanghpaw kaw jawn ai bu hkawm masha ni gaw mungdan shang ahkang lakmat nlang hkawm ra na re."" (Ship passengers will need to navigate all immigration requirements). This directly implies that dealing with immigration requirements is something they *will* have to face, not avoid. However, the question asks what they can avoid *if* they do a cruise tour. Because they have to go through immigration either way, the option that they can *avoid* is the potential hardship/complication/extra work related to it, which makes option C the most accurate answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: mare kaba hta ahkying aten (time in the city)**: The passage says the Saint Petersburg tour *includes* time to explore the city.

*   **B: hkyen hpe lai di na lam (crossing the equator)**: The passage doesn't mention crossing the equator; it mentions the Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean Sea.

*   **D: Saint Petersburg**: The passage explicitly mentions visiting Saint Petersburg.

Therefore, only needing to navigate immigration requirements is implied as something they can avoid by going on a cruise tour as per the passage.
"
Hpa majaw Catalan gaw Barcelona kaw masat kumla hte ndau shabra laika ni hpe jahring hkring jai lai ai rai?,"The best answer is **B: Dai gaw mare kaba a shawng ningnan tsun shaga ai ga re**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Catalan is the official language of Barcelona and is used in most public signage and announcements. This points to it being the primary language of the city.
*   Option A is incorrect because the passage states the majority understand both Catalan and Spanish.
*   Option C is subjective and not directly supported by the passage. The passage focuses on its status as the official language.
*   Option D has no direct support from the passage and would not justify why Catalan is used in the first place.

Therefore, the fact that Catalan is the city's native or primary language is the most logical reason for its prominence in signage and announcements."
Barcelona Metro gaw ayan shiga shana na matu gara tsun shaga ai lam hpe jai lang ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Catalan**.

The passage states: ""Metro kaw ayang shana ai hpe Catalan kaw sha galaw wa sai"" which translates to ""The metro always announces in Catalan only.""
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na mai kaja htap htuk ai lam gara gaw manap lusha hte zinghkam yupra na ningshawng jaw masa n re ai rai?","The passage mentions these aspects of B&B breakfasts:

*   Locally sourced ingredients
*   Homemade dishes/special recipes of the host

It mentions these aspects of location/ambiance:

*   Historic buildings
*   Antiques
*   Landscaped grounds
*   Swimming pools

Let's review the provided options:

*   **A: Laksan lusha jahpan (Special food menu):** This *is* mentioned in the passage as a possible aspect of the breakfast, with a focus on the host's special dishes.
*   **B: Laklai ai manu dan rai ni hte shachying tawn da ai ni (Decorated with unique antiques):** This *is* mentioned as a possible aspect of the location/ambiance of the B&B.
*   **C: Shinggan shara ni atsawm sha hkang zing da ai (Well-maintained outdoor spaces):** This *is* mentioned as landscaped grounds.
*   **D: Lawan ai WiFi (Fast WiFi):** This is **not** mentioned in the passage.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Lawan ai WiFi**."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw B&Bs zinghkam lapran shingjawng ai madung lamyi laman kaw na langai n re ai rai?","The passage states that B&Bs primarily compete on two aspects: the sleeping arrangement and the breakfast. Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Ban prat rum shatsawm tawn ai (Era-appropriate decorations)**: The passage mentions that some B&Bs are located in historical houses with antiques, which relates to the decor. However, it's not specifically stated as a primary area of competition.

*   **B: Du hkra hte htuk ai manap lusha hpan law law (A wide variety of appropriate breakfasts)**: The passage directly mentions that the breakfast is a key element, specifically highlighting ""du hkra hte htuk ai mu hpa lusha ni (sh) manam madu a laksan shat mai ni lawm mai nga ai.""

*   **C: Prat dep zinghkam yupra (Modern sleeping arrangement)**: The passage directly mentions competing based on the sleeping arrangement.

*   **D: Grupyin buga kaw na lusha ni (Local foods)**: The passage directly mentions the breakfast element in the B&B.

Based on the passage, options B and D are breakfast elements. Option C, the sleeping arrangement, is a core element of the B&B. Option A is a location element.

Therefore, the answer is **A: Ban prat rum shatsawm tawn ai (Era-appropriate decorations)**, as it is not explicitly mentioned as one of the two primary areas where B&Bs compete in the given text."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, 2022 Beijing hta lawu kaw na gara lamang hpe n'galaw na rai?","The correct answer is **B: Taizicheng hkyen jawn shara lamang**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the *hpawng hpaw* and *hpawng ginchyum* (opening and closing) ceremonies will be held in Beijing.
*   The passage also mentions *nta kata kaw hkyen jawn ai* (indoor ice skating) events will be held in Beijing.
*   The passage mentions that *laga skiing lamang ni hpe Beijing hte 220 km daram tsan ai Zhangjiakou shara kaw galaw na re*, so Taizicheng skiing events will be held away from Beijing, the question asked which event will NOT be held in Beijing.

Therefore, Taizicheng skiing events will not be in Beijing."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw 2022 Beijing hku nna lamang madu rai na rai?","The correct answer is **C: Nshung ta Olympic**.

The passage states ""Miwa mungdan a Beijing muklum gaw 2022 na Olympic Nshung ta Ginsup poi a nta madu re na re"" which translates to ""Beijing, China will host the 2022 Winter Olympic Games"". The term ""Nshung ta Ginsup poi"" directly translates to ""Winter Olympic Games."" While options A, B, and D are mentioned in the context of the Winter Olympics in Beijing, they aren't the main event Beijing is hosting. The primary event Beijing is hosting is the Winter Olympics (Nshung ta Olympic).
"
U li mak hkalawng ana kap na tsaw dik shoihpa nga ai ni gaw kadai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: U hkai byek rem ai bungli masha ni**.

The passage states: ""Law malawng gaw u hkai byek rem ai bungli galaw ai ni lawm ai..."" which translates to ""Most of them include people working in poultry farming..."" This indicates that poultry farmers are the most common group affected. Although the passage also mentions that even those who care for birds can be at risk, the most cases involve poultry farmers."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw u li byin ai hte seng nna hkrak tup lu tang madun ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: U yu bungli galaw ai ni kaw ana kap na lam shoihpa nga ai**

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""...raitim u yu ai bungli hta hkrit ra ai baw nkau mung lawm ai."" This translates to ""...but some jobs involving handling birds also have risks."" This directly supports option C, indicating there's a risk of infection for people who work with birds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: U hkai byek rem ai bungli masha ni sha u li ana kap ai:** P states that U hkai byek rem ai bungli galaw ai ni lawm ai, raitim u yu ai bungli hta hkrit ra ai baw nkau mung lawm ai, which means u hkai byek rem ai bungli masha ni hte u yu bungli galaw ai ni u li ana kap chye ai.

*   **B: Mabyin law law gaw u ni hta grau shinggyim masha ni hta ana kap ai ngu na shiga tang shawn ai:** This contradicts P. P states ""Shinggyim masha ni hta gaw ndai ana ni hkying hku pi n du ai hpe mu lu ai,"" meaning that very few people contract the disease.

*   **D: Shinggyim masha hta ana kap ai mabyin yawng gaw si wa mai ai baw re:** P states that ""nkau mi gaw si wa mai ai baw ni re,"" meaning that only some cases of people contracting the disease are fatal.
"
Panglai Hpraw-Baltic Canal gaw hpa hte matut da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Arctic Panglai hte Baltic Panglai**.

The passage states: ""Panglai Hpraw - Baltic Canal gaw hka nu hte nawng malawng kaw na lwi wa ai Onega Nawng, Ladoga Nawng hte Saint Petersburg hkan na sha re nna Arctic Nammuk dara kaw na Baltic Panglai hte matut da ai.""  This directly says the White Sea-Baltic Canal connects the Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, kaning re jak rai hpan gaw bu hkawm ai ni hpe gin jang hpa n byin na matu maigan pru hkawm lakmat hpe zing la da ya na rai?","The correct answer is **B: Shana yup wanleng ni**.

The passage states that on overnight trains, the train attendant will collect your passport to prevent disturbances while you sleep.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, nkau jarit lai wanleng ni hta galoi hkan tara shang ID hpe jep ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Hkawm taw ai wanleng hta** (While the train is moving).

The passage states: ""Mungdan lai di wanleng nkau ni hta, jep ai lam ni hpe wanleng ding yang lagat let sha galaw ai..."" which translates to: ""On some cross-border trains, inspections are done while the train is moving."" Therefore, the answer is D.
"
Sigapore na kahtet shadang tsaw ai shara kaw nga ai shaloi lawu kaw na gara gaw manghkang byin na zawn re ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Kahtet kahpau ai**.

The passage explicitly states that Singapore, being located near the equator, experiences high temperatures. Therefore, the most likely problem you'd face is overheating (kahtet kahpau ai).
"
German shadung muk ni hpe sha na matu kadai koi yen na rai?,"The passage mentions that German baked goods often contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Therefore, people with nut allergies should avoid German baked goods.

The correct answer is:

**A: Kawp ja hkum ahpun ana nga ai ni (People with nut allergies)**
"
Lawu kaw na gara gayau bang rai gaw German shadung muk a du hkra hte seng ai npawt ru di rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Haze kawp ja si** and **D: Lahkyang si**.

The passage mentions that ""German masha law law gaw lahkyang si (almond), haze si hte kaga kawp ja si ni gayau da ai rai ni hpe muk kabaw ai."" This indicates that both almonds (lahkyang si) and hazelnuts (haze si) are common ingredients in German baking.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw manu hpa bu hkawm hkrun lam na matu madi shadaw ai n re ai rai?","The passage advises against taking advantage of others to save money on travel. Therefore, asking people for money (option C) is not supported by the passage and is the correct answer.

So the answer is **C: masha ni kaw gumhpraw hpyi na**.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw jailang jahpan nlaw dik ai kaw bu hkawm ai shaloi mayak mahkak hkrum mai ai rai?","The passage suggests that budget travelers should be willing to endure hardships. Option A, ""Yak hkak ai hpe hkap tau la chye ai masha ni"" (People who are willing to embrace hardship), directly reflects this idea.

Therefore, the answer is **A**.
"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Marion shara hte Fairmont lapran mawdaw gau ai lam hpe tup hkrak n lu tsun dan ai rai?,"The passage states:

*   The drive between Marion and Fairmont is challenging due to the long drive on Route Buffalo-Pittsburgh, mountainous terrain.
*   Rural roads require careful driving due to dips, narrow paths, and sharp turns.
*   Speed limits are typically 35-40 mph, lower in some sections.
*   Following speed limits is crucial.
*   Phone service is better than in other rural Pennsylvania areas.

Analyzing the options:

*   A: ""There are long rural sections"" - This is supported by the passage's mention of ""Nam kahtawng na lam ni ntsa nau n gawt ga shi ai nga yang gaw..."" (if you drive too fast on rural roads...).
*   B: ""The paths are narrow"" - This is supported by the passage's mention of ""gyip ai lam kaji ni"" (narrow paths).
*   C: ""Obeying speed limits is difficult"" - The passage explicitly says ""Ndai masat shadang ni hpe hkan nang hkan sa na lam gaw kaga lam ni hta ahkyak dik htum re."" (Following these speed limits is extremely important compared to other paths.), meaning it is *important*, not necessarily difficult, to follow them.
*   D: ""Cell phone service is problematic"" - The passage states ""ndai phone line gaw Pennsylvania lamu ga nhprang zawn re kaga shara, kaga lam ni hta ndai kaw grau kaja nga ai"" (phone service is better here than in other rural Pennsylvania areas), implying that phone service is *not* problematic.

Therefore, the correct answer is C because the passage emphasizes the *importance* of following speed limits, not the difficulty of doing so.

Final Answer: (C)"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw Buffalo-Pittsburg mawdaw lam kaba kaw bu hkawm ai mawdaw gau ai ni na matu madung myit tsang lam rai na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Mawdaw htinglet ai lam kaw chyat nga na**. Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the following points about the Buffalo-Pittsburgh route:

*   **Difficult driving conditions:** Mentions it being one of the most difficult driving sections due to mountainous terrain.
*   **Rural roads:** Warns against excessive speed on rural roads because of bumps, narrow turns, and sharp bends.
*   **Adherence to speed limits:** Stresses the importance of following the prescribed speed limit (35-40 mph) and even slower in some sections.

Given these concerns, the greatest concern for drivers is **A: Mawdaw htinglet ai lam kaw chyat nga na** because the text mentions ""cadawng ai nemrem ni, gyip ai lam kaji ni hte masen ai dingngwi ni hkan sadi nna atsawm sha gawt u."" The mention of bumps, narrow turns, and sharp bends indicates potential dangers for vehicles and would necessitate careful driving.

The other options are less likely to be the primary concern:

*   **B: Law htam ai radio phone magam n'nga ai:** While the passage states that phone service is better than in other areas of Pennsylvania, this is not presented as the biggest driving concern.
*   **C: Lawan magaw ai hpe grai lawan hkra magaw ai:** The passage warns about excessive speed, but does not say drivers may encounter Lawan magaw ai, so this is not the biggest driving concern.
*   **D: Jahkring hkring lam gram ai hte hkrum ai:** The passage does not mention anything about encountering traffic from road maintenance."
Lawu kaw na gara gaw canyouneering galaw hpang na matu ra rawng ai lam n re ai rai?,"Based on the provided text, the answer is **B: Tsaw dik hkrang hte seng ai masa (Peak physical condition)**

Here's why:

*   The text states that ""to begin, some fitness (or training) is needed"". Options A, C, and D all are mentioned in the text as ways to fulfill the need for ""some fitness (or training)"", but B is not mentioned."
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, awngdang ai canyoning tangpyaw hkrun lam na matu ra rawng ai rai?","Based on the description, the most relevant skills for a successful canyoning trip are:

*   **D: Hka hpung yawt chye ai atsam (The ability to swim)** - The passage explicitly mentions that canyoning involves elements of swimming.

While the passage mentions a need for a certain level of physical fitness and prior experience in related activities (like rock climbing), the core skill required for navigating canyons filled with water is the ability to swim.

Therefore, the best answer is **D**."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, tinang a mawdaw hta camp galaw na yaw shada da ai wa na matu hpa baw gaw karum shingtau hpa rai na rai?","The best answer based on the provided text is **B: Yup galeng mai ai baw lahkum lawm ai mawdaw.**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that if you have a ""dung lahkum mai jahkrat ai minivan kaba, SUV, Sedan (sh) Station Wagon ni lu ai re yang mawdaw kaw yup nna bu hkawm ai lam mai galaw nga ai."" This directly relates to the idea of having a vehicle suitable for sleeping in.
*   A is too general. The passage says you should know your car's limits, but that's a prerequisite, not necessarily helpful *specifically* for car camping.
*   C and D are relevant to camping in general, but the passage is focused on camping *in* your car, not in a tent next to your car.

Therefore, B is the most direct and relevant answer based on the given information."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, mawdaw hte camp galaw ai ni gaw radar npu hta nga na matu shara tam taw ai rai yang shanhte hpa hpe koi kau mayu na rai?","The correct answer is **C: Mare hta (sh) dinghkrai shara hta janghpang nbung jawng ginsum masat shachyaw na**.

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses the advantages of car camping for people who want flexibility and to avoid the inconveniences of setting up traditional camps (""Shara laga kaw nta kasha galaw ai dai nrai myit shang sha nra ai ni hpe myu shagu hta aloi sha lu galaw ai""). Thus, car campers try to find spots that are ""under the radar"". The passage implied that one of the ""inconveniences"" is setting up traditional camps in ""conventional locations"". The opposite of this would be setting up camp in towns or designated campgrounds.
*   **A: SUV (sh) minivan zawn re ai grau kaba ai mawdaw hpe gawt ai lam:** The passage mentions that having larger vehicles like SUVs or minivans is *helpful* for car camping. So they wouldn't be trying to avoid driving larger vehicles.
*   **B: Grau galu ai mawdaw hkrun lam hpe lata la na:** The passage implied that long car journeys are a positive of car camping.
*   **D: Shanhte jai lang gawt taw ai mawdaw hte seng nna hkau chyap ai lam n nga ai:** The passage implies you are ""very familiar"" with the vehicle."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, Casablanca hpe lahkawng lang hku nna kadai gaw gap wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Portuguese**.

The text states: ""Portuguese gaw dai shara hpe shaning 1755 ning na nnang nawn ai hpang sha kabai tawn kau nna, dai hpe jahten kau ai hte Casa Branca ngu ai mying npu hta bai gaw gap ai."" This translates to ""The Portuguese abandoned the place after the 1755 earthquake, destroying it and rebuilding it under the name Casa Branca."" Therefore, they rebuilt Casablanca.
"
Shingra tsin-yam tsindam hpang Casablanca na prat dep mare hpe kadai ni kabai kau ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Portuguese**.

The passage states that the Portuguese abandoned the area after the 1755 earthquake.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Sintra gaw maigan amyu ni lapran matsing masat hkrum ai lam hpe gara hku lu wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Lord Byron na mai kaja ai maram yu ai lam**.

The passage states that Sintra is a ""myit pyaw hpa Sintra mare kaba rai nga ai, dai shara gaw maigan masha ni a matu mying kaba hkra lajang da ai re majaw dai hpe hkik hkam dik ai shara ngu Lord Byron matsing sumhting da ai."" This translates to: ""Sintra is a wonderful city, famous among foreigners, so much so that Lord Byron described it as a glorious Eden.""

This clearly indicates that Lord Byron's positive comments about Sintra contributed to its fame among foreigners.
"
Armenia ni a matsing masat da n hkrum ai hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Gumsan magam mungdan nnan**

The passage states that a new independent nation was formed, but it remains largely unrecognized by the international community.
"
Hpa gaw Azerbaijan hte Armenia lapran kanawn mazum ai lam hpe matut nna machyi shangun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Nagorno-Karabakh ginra**.

The passage directly states that the conflict stemmed from the Armenian population in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan. While the 1994 war (B) and political instability (C) are related, the core issue is the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. Option A is not mentioned as the root cause of the conflict."
"Charlotte hta mawdaw shap yang, hpa gaw bungjat jahpu manu byin wa chye rai?","Based on the passage, the reason why getting a taxi in Charlotte might be more expensive is:

*   **B: Hkrun lam masha masum nga yang (Having three people on the trip)**

The passage states that taxis are mostly not used by Charlotte residents and are more expensive for two travelers. This implies that for groups larger than two, the cost efficiency worsens, making the taxi an even less attractive option."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, Charlotte hta ma ni hte nga yang hpa gaw n kaja ai ngu myit lu ai rai?","The passage mentions that taxis are not widely used by families in Charlotte. It implies this is because they are not cost-effective compared to other options for two travelers.

Therefore, the best answer is:

**B: Taxi mawdaw shap jawn ai** (Taxi service)
"
"Spain ni n du shi yang, Chile na dingdung maga hpe kadai up hkang ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Inca ni**.

The passage states that before the arrival of the Spanish in 16th century Chile, the Inca people controlled the northern part of Chile.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw 1810 hta n byin wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Chile gaw Spain mungdan hpe awng padang lu la sai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Chile gaw 1810 hta rawt malan sai ngu ndau tim mung... gaja sha Spanish hpe shaning 1818 du hkra nlu dang manga la ma ai."" This means Chile declared independence in 1810, but didn't actually defeat Spain until 1818.

Let's look at the other options:

* **A: Dai shaloi madung asuya n'nga ai:** The passage mentions ""Napoleonic majan lapran shaning law law hta Spain ni gaw mungdan up hkang ai bungli atsawm nlu galaw wa ai"", so there wasn't a strong, centralized authority from Spain.
* **C: Napoleonic majan ni gasat gala byin taw ai:** The passage explicitly mentions ""Napoleonic majan lapran"".
* **D: Chile gaw rawt malan ndau shana sai:** The passage states ""Chile gaw 1810 hta rawt malan sai ngu ndau tim mung"".

Therefore, only option B is not true based on the information given.
"
Liguria ginra na tsan ai mare de masha ni gara hku lu du na rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Wanleng (sh) hkali hte**

The passage states: ""Lam ni, wanleng ni hte hkali ni dai mare ni hte matut tawn ai rai nna mawdaw ni chyawm gaw shinggan hku nmai du nga ai."" This translates to ""Roads, trains, and boats connect these villages, but cars cannot access them from the outside.""

Therefore, people can reach the remote villages using either trains (wanleng) or boats (hkali).

Italy ga hkum 'Cinque Terre’ gaw hpa hpe tsun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Mare manga**.

The passage states: ""Kawng Manga ngu lachyum pru ai Cinque Terre gaw Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza hte Italy ginra a Liguria kaw nga ai Monterosso ni ngu ai hkinggau mayan mare kaji manga pawng hpawm da ai mare re."" This translates to ""Cinque Terre, which means Five Lands, is a group of five small coastal villages: Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza, and Monterosso, located in Liguria, Italy."" Therefore, Cinque Terre means ""Five Lands"" which refers to the five villages. ""Mare"" translates to ""Land"" or ""Area"". Hence Mare Manga refers to five lands or areas that are the five villages.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, nshung ta hta gashawt na lam byin chye ai mabyin masa na matu lawu kaw na gara buk hkyep din gaw htap htuk ai rai?","Based on the provided text, the best answer is **B: Hkyepdin laju lawm ai buk hkyep din ni (Boot that contain traction pads)**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Nkau buk hkyep din ni gaw hkyepdin laju ni lawm nna kashawt ai ginra matu hte hkyepdin lahtin ni yawng a matu htap htuk manu ai laksan shakap la na hkyepdin laju ni mung nga nga ai."" This translates to ""Some boots have traction pads, and there are also special traction pads that can be attached to any type of boot, which are suitable for slippery ground and all types of boot soles.""

The other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Gyip ai lagaw lahtin hte re ai buk hkyep din ni (Boot with narrow leg)** The passage states that leg boots should be narrow, not that narrow leg boots are appropriate for slippery conditions.
*   **C: Lagaw lahtin tsaw ai buk hkyep din ni (Boots with high leg)** The passage explicitly states that leg boots should be short and thick: ""Lagaw lahtin ni gaw nem nnga dam dam re ging ai.""
*   **D: 1/5 letma sung maka kumla n lawm ai buk hkyep din ni (Boots with no scar more than 1/5 inch deep)** The passage describes scar marks as an indication of whether a boot is worn out and not directly related to preventing slipping."
Nshung ta na hkyen pa lam ni kaw lawu kaw na gara gaw gang dun n-gun hpe grau kaja hkra n lu galaw ya ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: lung sha** (calcium chloride).

The passage states: ""Zaibru, lung sha jum (calcium chloride) ni gaw gang dun n-gun grau nga na matu lam nmaw lam kaji hkan de jahkring hkring bra taw ai."" This clearly indicates that both Zaibru and lung sha jum (calcium chloride) are used to improve traction. Of the options given, only lung sha is present.
"
Hawaii hte Cook Island lapran lawu kaw na gara gaw tup hkrak bung ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Lahkawng yan gaw ahkying ginwang bung ai** (Both have the same time zone).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Hawaii hte aten bung nna..."" which translates to ""Same time as Hawaii...""

The other options are incorrect based on the passage:

*   **A:** The passage implies Cook Islands might *remind* people of when Hawaii *didn't* have many tourists and development.
*   **B:** The passage doesn't state the current status of Hawaii or Cook islands regarding their autonomy or independence.
*   **D:** The passage explicitly says that while Cook Islands don't have large cities, it is made up of 15 islands, implying that there are populated settlements."
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Cook zunlawng hpe tup hkrak n lu htawn dan ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Rarotonga hte Aitutaki gaw madung mare kaba ni re**.

Here's why:

*   **P:** ""The Cook Zunlawng ni hta mare kaba ngu ai hku nnga ai raitim nbung ai zunlawng 15 hte gahkyin da ai re. Madung zunlawng ni gaw Rarotonga hte Aitutaki re."" This translates to: ""The Cook Islands do not have large cities, but are made up of 15 inhabited islands. The main islands are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.""

    Option C states that they are the main *cities*, which is incorrect. They are the main *islands*, but the passage explicitly says there are no large cities.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: Hawaii hta grau kaji ai:** The passage doesn't explicitly state this, but the overall tone and comparison to Hawaii suggest the Cook Islands are smaller and less developed. So this statement is likely correct.
*   **B: Dai gaw zunlawng majaw re:** ""Dai shara gaw panglai ga 15 daram hte 2.2 million km2 daram nga ai re."" The passage directly states it consists of islands.
*   **D: Zunlawng mungdan gaw Hawaii ahkying ginwang hte maren sha re:** The passage states that Hawaii and the Cook Islands share the same time zone.

**Therefore, the only statement that is definitively incorrect based on the passage is C.**"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara namkawn du dabang gaw shana yup mai ai manam dum nta lata la ahkang lahkawng nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

The passage states: ""Sirena gaw camping hta jan na shana yup mai ai manam jarawp hte kahtet hpoi hpoi lusha ni ma jaw ai namkawn du dabang rai nga ai."" This translates to ""Sirena is a ranger station that offers sleeping in dormitories in addition to camping and offers hot meals."" Therefore, Sirena offers both camping and dormitory options for sleeping.

The passage states: ""Cafenet El Sol gaw alak myi lajang da ai lam hpe manu hpu US$30 hte galaw ya ai lam jaw nga ai re, ahkri ahkrai ni hpe gaw shanhte a Corcovado online laika man kaw re."" This translates to: ""Cafenet El Sol offers a reservation service for a fee of US$30; details are available on their Corcovado online page."" This indicates they can help with reservations if you're paying with money instead of a credit card (since the Puerto Jimenez Ranger station doesn't take credit cards).

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, kaning re hkyen jawn ai gaw n'hkap kadawng ai bum ntsa kaw galaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Hkyen pa jawn bum lung ai**.

The passage states: ""Bum lung ai lam hpe gaw n'hkap kadawng ai bum ntsa kaw galaw ra na rai..."" which translates to ""Mountaineering is done on non-skiable mountains..."" and the answer choice A, *Hkyen pa jawn bum lung ai* is referring to mountineering. Therefore, that is the answer.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, grau tsaw chyang shadang de du mayu ai backcountry hkyen pa jawn ai ni hpe hpa gaw lu karum na rai?","The correct answer is **C: Kaja ai masa lam (Good weather conditions)**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Kaja ai masa lam ni hta sha lam hkawm ai hta grau tsan ai shara ni hpe nang lu galaw na re (In good weather conditions, you can do things further than hiking)."" This directly implies that good weather helps backcountry skiers reach higher or further locations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ja ai buk hkyepdin ni (Strong boots):** While the passage mentions ""hkyep din ja ja (strong boots)"", it is in the context of climbing *un-sloped* mountains and is NOT related to backcountry skiing where the goal is to reach higher places.
*   **B: Li la ai rai (light pack):** The text emphasizes that backcountry skiing can be done with light equipment so that one can travel far, suggesting that a **light** pack helps skiers to travel to higher elevations, NOT a heavy one.
*   **D: Jasan jaseng da ai lam ni (Cleared paths):** Backcountry skiing implies off-piste, ungroomed conditions; so, cleared paths would be counter to the activity.

Bai shang wa ai kajawng hpa hpe hkrum sha ai bu hkawm ai ni hta hpa mayak nga ai rai?,"The passage directly states that returning travelers may find it difficult to readjust to their home culture. It also highlights the lack of understanding and patience they may face upon returning.

Therefore, the best answer is **D: Shanhte a daidaw buga htunghking hpe man hkra bai galaw ra ai lam (The difficulty of readjusting to their home culture)**

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Shara ningnan na htunghking ningli hpe man hkra shakut ai lam (Adjusting to a new culture)** - This is about the initial adjustment to a *new* culture, not the readjustment to the *home* culture.
*   **B: Myit galu ai hte myit hkawn ai lam (Patience and understanding)** - While the passage mentions the *lack* of patience and understanding they receive upon return, this isn't the traveler's struggle, but rather how others treat them.
*   **C: Mungdan kaga de bu hkawm ai lam (Traveling to another country)** - This is a general statement and doesn't address the specific issue of *re-entry shock*."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, bai shang wa ai kajawng hpa gaw kaning re bu hkawm ai ni na matu alak mi mayak mahkak byin na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Laksan n'kaja ai htunghking hpe mau kajawng ai lam mahkrum madup nga lai wa sai bu hkawm ai ni**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes ""re-entry shock""** which is characterized by:
    * An initial honeymoon phase (excitement about the new culture).
    * A period of feeling overwhelmed or homesick
    *  A period of adjusting and starting to be negative about the new culture.
    * Difficulty readjusting to their home culture after being away.

* Option A directly addresses this, stating that travellers who have experienced cultural adaptation are more likely to face re-entry shock.

* The other options are less relevant or inconsistent with the text:

    *   **B: Maigan kaw nga ai shaloi lawan ai hku jahtuk lai wa sai bu hkawm ai ni** - While quick acculturation might make someone miss their home culture more, the text emphasizes the *re-entry* aspect, not the speed of initial adaptation.

    *   **C: Honeymoon phase kaw du ai bu hkawm ai ni** - The honeymoon phase is the *start* of the cultural adjustment process, not the phase associated with re-entry difficulties.

    *   **D: Myit kadun ai bu hkawm ai ni** - Impatience might exacerbate re-entry shock, but the passage doesn't directly link impatience to the *specific* challenges of returning home and is a character flaw and does not have any relation to culture."
Lawu kaw na gara gaw shinggyim masha ni hku nna shan krang kaba hpe n mai galaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Grai gau ngwi hkra shani sa ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Masha ni shan krang kaba hpe hkrit hpa re ai ngu nmu mada na makau de nau shani sa yang shanhte ni hkrit hpa hkrum sha chye ai."" This translates to: ""If people get too close, believing the elephants aren't dangerous, they might encounter something dangerous.""  This clearly indicates getting too close is undesirable.

Let's analyze the other options:

* **A: Shanhte nga ai lam hpe n-gawn nsawn di ai (Ignoring their presence):** The passage does not mention that this is something that the people should avoid.
* **C: Shanhte a byin mai ai jahkrit shama ai madang hpe shayawm myit ai lam (Reducing their potential aggression):** This is desirable.
* **D: Shanhte hpe tsan ai kaw na masam mayam yu ai (Watching them from afar):** This is implied as a safer and acceptable behavior.

Therefore, getting too close (option B) is what people should *not* do.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw shan krang kaba ni hte seng nna n teng man ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Shanhte hpe kalang marang byin wa mai ai jahkrit shama ai lam hku na nchye na ai**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""...raitim shanhte hpe jahkrit shama wa yang gaw bai htim wa chye ai."" (Even though they naturally avoid conflict, if they are threatened, they will attack back.)
*   **Option B says:** Shanhte hpe kalang marang byin wa mai ai jahkrit shama ai lam hku na nchye na ai (They don't understand random threats).
*   **This is false:** The passage implies they *do* understand threats, because they react to them by attacking.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

*   **A: Shanhte gaw shingra tara hku na jahte tam chye ai dusat ni re** (They are naturally shy animals) - This is true, as the passage says they naturally avoid conflict (""shan krang kaba (zau nyi kaba ngu mung chye da ai) gaw mi kaw nna jahte ntam chye ma ai"").
*   **C: Shinggyim masha ni hku nna shanhte hpe nyi kahtep ai laman jasu alun lu ai** (Humans can be in danger if they get too close to them) - This is true. The passage says if people get too close without realizing the danger, they might be in danger.
*   **D: Ra kadawn ai ten hta shanhte gaw shanhte hkum nan ninghkap makawp maga lu ai** (They can defend themselves when needed) - This is true, as the passage says they attack back if threatened (""jahkrit shama wa yang gaw bai htim wa chye ai"").

Therefore, the only statement that is NOT true according to the passage is **B**."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw zaibru jang bu hkawm ai wa a matu hkrit shara n'nga dik gaw hpa rai?","The passage states:

*   ""Kahtet dik ai zai bru jang hkan pyi gaw shana rai yang na chying katsi chye ai."" (Even during the hottest deserts, nights can be very cold.)

Therefore, not having warm clothing (palawng lum nlawm yang) during a cold night (katsi ai shana hta) is the most dangerous situation described.

The correct answer is **A: Katsi ai shana hta lum ai bu hpun palawng n'ga ai (Not having warm clothing on a cold night)**."
Lawu kaw na gara gaw zai bru jang bu hkawm ai ni a matu byin mai ai mayak hku na n tsun da ai rai?,"Based on the passage, the option that is NOT mentioned as a potential danger for travelers in the Gobi desert is:

*   **D: Janhkru ai lam**

The passage discusses water scarcity, the dangers of extreme temperature fluctuations (including frostbite), and the risk of hypothermia. It does not mention getting lost or becoming separated from your group (i.e., ""janhkru ai lam"")."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, sa du masam maram ai ni du ngut ai hpang gara uhpung masha gaw hkrum machyi kaba byin ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Taínos ni**.

This translates to: ""After the arrival of European explorers, within a short period of time, the Tainos population was drastically reduced, mainly by the oppressive Spanish people.""

The passage also says that the Spanish killed approximately 100,000 Tainos between 1492 and 1498.

(Taiˊno and Caribe people first settled on this island. The Caribe people lived there from around 10,000 BCE and spoke the Arawakan language.)
"

Here's why: The passage states that the first organized ski club was started by Norwegians in Australia in 1861. This indicates that Norwegians played a significant role in the development and popularization of skiing as a sport.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, galoi ten hkan hta hkyen jawn ai hpe shawng ningnan n-gun ginsup ai hku na masat la sai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Tsa ban 17**.

"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw sinpraw Africa hkringau mayan na kaba dik ai zunlawng hte baw hpan ginrun taw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Dusat dumyeng**

The passage states: ""Madagascar gaw kaba dik htum rai nna dai gaw nam na du sat du myeng ni rau seng ai dan re nga ai."" This translates to ""Madagascar is the largest and is a country rich in wildlife."" Since Madagascar is described as the largest island near East Africa, and being rich in wildlife (dusat dumyeng), that is the answer.
"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw grau kaji ai sinpraw Africa zunlawng ni a shingkang shingwang n re ai rai? ,"The correct answer is **C: Dusat dumyeng a arawng sadang**.

Here's why:

*   **A: France hte matut mahkai ai lam (Connection with France):** The passage mentions that many of the smaller islands are independent countries associated with France or French territories.
*   **B: Zinghkam bansa shara law law (Many resort locations):** The passage refers to them as known resort coastlines.
*   **D: Kaga amyu sha ni kaw na shang lawt lu ai lam (Independence from other races):** The passage discusses the islands becoming independent countries.

*   **C: Dusat dumyeng a arawng sadang (Status of animals):** While Madagascar is mentioned as having unique wildlife, this is only concerning Madagascar and not small East African Islands generally.
Therefore, the answer is **C**."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, Madu Yesu hkrung rawt wa ai nhtoi hpe htunghking hte seng ai yu maya nawku htingnu nkau mi gara hku poi galaw ma ai rai?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: Jan pru ten hpe yu ai**.

The passage specifically mentions that there is a custom of staying up all night on Easter to watch the sunrise. While it also mentions other Easter traditions, only watching the sunrise is directly linked to how some celebrate the day.

The text says: ""Sa na wa na / sa na sha lengmak a matu nang gada ya nga na hpe madun ra ai."" This translates to ""For the round trip / one-way ticket, you must show how long you will stay.""  Therefore, showing a round-trip or one-way ticket to demonstrate the length of your stay is a requirement.
"
Ecuador na bu hkawm ra ladawn ai gaw gara na matu masat galaw da lam n'nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Htawt ai lam seng nna zinlum ai tsang hte tsang bungli masa hpe hkang zing da ai lam** (Managing risks and processes associated with immigration).

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses requirements for Cuban citizens to enter Ecuador, specifically addressing documentation and procedures. This suggests a focus on controlling and managing immigration processes to minimize potential risks.

Let's examine why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Bu hkawm masha hti hkum hpe grit htum galaw da ai lam** (Maximizing the number of tourists): The passage does not focus on increasing tourism.

*   **C: Bu hkawm ai wa a kade ya nga na hpe shagrin ai lam** (Verifying how long the traveler will stay): While the passage mentions demonstrating return travel arrangements, the *primary* purpose is not solely focused on verifying the length of stay.

*   **D: Passport ni a tara shang ai lam hpe hkrang hkrang tsun ai** (Ensuring the legality of passports): The passage discusses passport validity, but it's part of a broader effort to manage immigration procedures, not the sole goal."
Tinang a buga hta grau maigan mung hta hpa gaw grau manu hpu na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Myi jep ai lam**.

The passage explicitly states that eye exams are cheaper in foreign countries, especially those with lower labor costs and currency values.
"
Maigan mung hta mying kaba ai hkrang ni hpe mari yang shoihpa byin chye ai hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Nkau ni gaw masu rai byin chye ai (Some may be fake).**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ndai shara kaw nga ai mying kaba ai brand ni hpe sadi ra ai lam lahkawng nga ai. Nkau mi gaw nau njet ai arai ni mai byin nna, nkau jet ai arai ni chyawm gaw nta kaw nga ai arai hta nan grau hpu chye ma ai."" This directly translates to: ""There are two things to be careful of with famous brands in these places. Some may be fake, and some genuine items may be more expensive than what's available at home.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bungjat myi jep ai lam ra wa na (Bungjat myi jep ai lam ra wa na)**: This is too general. It does not explain the risks of purchasing popular name-brand products abroad.
*   **B: Nkau hkrang ni na matu tsi matsun ai lam n mai byin ai (Nkau hkrang ni na matu tsi matsun ai lam n mai byin ai)**: This is too specific. It is not a general risk of buying big brands.
*   **D: Jarik na matu pahkam gumhpraw nlaw ai (Jarrik na matu pahkam gumhpraw nlaw ai)**: While the passage mentions lower costs overall, this option doesn't directly address the risk associated with buying popular name-brand products.

Here's why:

*   **A: British pound gumhpraw hte hkoi shap card ni hpe sha htingjut htingnaw zunlawng hta hkap la ai** - The passage says that in settlements, coins are *not* usually accepted.

*   **B: Stanley gaw United States dollar gumhpraw hpe sha hkap la na shara re** - The passage indicates that Stanley *sometimes* accepts US dollars, but that British pounds are widely accepted.

*   **C: Zunlawng kaw na pru wa ngut ai hpang Falkland pound gumhpraw ni hpe galai la ra ai** - The passage states the opposite: that you should exchange Falkland pounds *before* leaving the islands.

*   **D: Falkland pound gumhpraw n lawm yang, British pound gumhpraw gaw hkap la dik htum jai gumhpraw masa re** - The passage says that British pounds are widely accepted everywhere on the islands."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, United States kaw na Falkland de bu hkawm yang, hkoi shap card hte n re sha, gumhpraw jaw ai lam ladat gaw gara ni hkan akyu byin na rai?","The answer is **D: Stanley shara shagu**. Here's why:

*   The passage states that British pounds are widely accepted throughout the islands, and even U.S. dollars are sometimes accepted, especially in Stanley. The only places where you can be sure you can pay are Stanley shara shagu."
Nawku htingnu poi shingra galaw ai hte seng nna lawu kaw na gara lamang gaw ginrun ai lam n'nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Magwi langai shangai ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses the celebration of church festivals.** These festivals are typically tied to:
    *  An anniversary of the church's founding.
    *  The birthdate of the church's patron saint (angel).
    *  Other events related to the church.
* **Options B, C, and D** all directly relate to a church anniversary, a patron saint, or events related to the church.
* **Option A** (Magwi langai shangai ai lam - The birth of a Magwi) doesn't fit the context provided in the passage. The passage doesn't mention ""Magwi"" or their birth being related to church celebrations. It seems irrelevant to the topic.
"
Shatsawm da ai magwi hpe gara kaw mu lu mai rai?,"Based on the provided text, the most appropriate answer is:

*   **D: Kerala lam ni hkan**

Here's why:

*   The text specifically mentions that Kerala churches are decorated with floats (magoi sumla ni). This makes option D the most direct and relevant answer to the question of where to find decorated floats. While options B and C are relevant to church events, the text only clearly links decorated floats with Kerala churches.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw hpaga madang (sh) ningshawng madang pyenli manu gumhpraw shayawm na matu byin mai dik ai lam rai?","The passage clearly states that searching for discounted fares for first-class or business-class seats is futile. It emphasizes that these classes are geared towards individuals willing to pay a premium for comfort and convenience. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: Shayawm manu tam na**

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tinang bungli galaw ai hpaga hpung ni hku na lakmat mari na:** While corporate deals might exist, the passage implies that discounts are unlikely for these higher-class tickets.
*   **B: Hpaga madang n re sha ningshawng madang hpe tau hkrau lakmat mari na:** Advance booking doesn't guarantee a discount; it's more about securing a spot in a popular class.
*   **C: Kalang ta n re ai ningshawng madang pyenli hpe tau hkrau lakmat mari na:**  Again, booking in advance doesn't translate to a lower price, especially for premium classes.

The passage suggests that demand and willingness to pay a premium drive the prices of business and first-class tickets, rendering typical discount-seeking strategies ineffective."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw nkau manu pyenli madang ni hpe tau hkrau lakmat mari ai shaloi aten jahtum byin ai rai?","The text states that business class requires a higher fare and the discount rules are:

*   **Business Class:** Requires paying 4 times the cheapest economy ticket.
*   **First Class:** Requires paying 11 times the cheapest economy ticket.

The text also mentions that searching for discounts on first-class economy seats is useless because airlines understand that there's a group of people willing to pay a lot of money for the extra benefits of those classes.

**Therefore, the answer is likely D: Ningshawng madang (First Class)**.

The reason is that the text suggests discounts are not readily available for First Class.
"
Afrika de sa hkawm ai jarit hte mungkan ting gayin hkawm ai jarit shingdaw ai shaloi gara hpe rau npawng ra ai rai?,"The passage mentions that when comparing the cost of traveling in Africa to traveling around the world, you should remember to include the following costs specifically related to Africa:

*   Visa fees
*   Exit taxes
*   Ground transportation
*   Etc.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Afrika shinggan de na shara ni de sa na mungdan shang lakmat a matu manu jarik** - This option talks about visa costs *for destinations outside of Africa*, which is related to the *worldwide* travel portion of the comparison, not the *African* portion that the passage highlights. It's therefore not the *most* relevant for comparing the African and world travel budgets, specifically regarding costs one might overlook *in Africa*.
*   **B: Afrika hta pru wa na ahkun hkanse** - This corresponds directly to ""pru wa hkang se"" (exit taxes) mentioned in the passage. This is a cost specific to Africa that should be considered when comparing costs.
*   **C: Afrika mungdan shang lakmat manu** - This corresponds directly to ""mungdan shang lakmat"" (visa fees) mentioned in the passage. This is a cost specific to Africa that should be considered when comparing costs.
*   **D: Afrika shinggan shara na matu ga htaw wa htaw sa jarik** - Similar to option A, this talks about ground transportation *outside of Africa*. This is related to the *worldwide* travel portion of the comparison, not costs in Africa.

Options B and C are both correct based on the original passage. Since the question asks for a single correct answer, there may be missing context. If I were to choose the *most* correct answer, it would be **C: Afrika mungdan shang lakmat manu** because the visa costs are often a significant part of travel expenses and frequently overlooked.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, gat seng kaba ni jaw hpang ai grau na lata la hpa gaw hpa rai?","The answer is **C: Seng kaba kata hkan na lusha seng ni**

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the advantages of shopping at larger grocery stores (gat seng kaba ni).** It states they offer more affordable options and specifically mentions the availability of ""lusha seng"" (food packages/deals) at competitive prices in some countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ready-made lusha ni:** The passage mentions ready-made food as a *consequence* of not having cooking facilities, not as something desirable offered by large stores.
* **B: Lawan shadu myihprap wanhtung ni:** While the passage mentions some stores offer quick meal solutions, it's not the primary benefit highlighted.
* **D: Dang di lu ai manu:** Affordable prices are mentioned in the passage, but ""lusha seng"" offer the best value for money.
"
Gat seng kaba ni kaw na jaw ai kaning re htap htuk ai gaw ready-made lusha tut mari ai ni hpe shalen mai rai?,"Based on the passage (P), the correct answer is **A: Seng kaba kata hkan na lusha seng ni**.

Here's why:

* **P emphasizes that large supermarkets offer a wider variety of affordable food options.** It directly states: ""Gat seng kaba ni gaw alu tsu re lusha hpang law law grau nna law lu wa ma ai."" (Large supermarkets offer a wider variety of affordable food choices.)
* **The question (Q) asks about the advantage of large supermarkets for those who often buy ready-made food.**
* **A, ""Seng kaba kata hkan na lusha seng ni"" (Food counters/sections in large supermarkets), directly addresses the availability of diverse and potentially cheaper alternatives to pre-packaged meals.** These sections often offer prepared foods, fresh ingredients for cooking, and other options that could be more appealing and cost-effective than exclusively relying on ready-made meals.

The other options are less relevant:

* **B: Lata na lam nau n nga ai (Not much choice):** This contradicts the idea of the large variety that large supermarkets offer.
* **C: Lusha katsing (Food ingredients):** While ingredients are available, the passage focuses on the *variety* and *affordability* that makes large supermarkets attractive.
* **D: Lawan shadu myihprap wanhtung (Quick cooking equipment):** While some supermarkets may offer quick cooking solutions, it's not the core advantage for those primarily buying ready-made food. The key point is the variety of *food options* themselves.
"
Lawu kaw na gara hpe French ga shaga ai Belgian hte Swiss ni lachyum nchye na rai?,"The passage says that French-speaking Belgians and Swiss have a slight difference in vocabulary and pronunciation compared to French speakers in France. However, they understand each other well. The passage also states that French-speaking Belgians and Swiss need to be taught standard French in school to understand the numerical systems used in France.

Therefore, the answer is:

**A: French madang jat hti hkum nambat masa** (Standard French numerical systems)

The passage explicitly mentions that they need to be taught standard French to understand the numerical systems. The other options are implied to be understandable with a little effort, but the numerical systems require formal education in standard French.
"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Belgium (sh) Switzerland hte France n bung ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Nkau French gasi ni a shachyawm masa** (Some French vowels' pronunciation).

Here's why:

* **The passage states directly:**  ""...French ga shaga ai hte kaji mi shai hkat nna gasi nkau nsen shapraw ai hta mung loi shai ma ai.""  This translates to:  ""...differ slightly in their French speaking and differ slightly in the pronunciation of some vowels.""
* **Other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Gasi ni yawng a nsen** (All vowels' pronunciation) - The passage only mentions *some* vowels.
    * **B: Hti hkum nambat masa** (Numbering system) - The passage implies the numbering system is standard French (""nang lang ai French madang nambat ni"" - ""the standard French numbering system you use""), and the Belgian and Swiss speakers need to learn it to understand it.
    * **C: Jawng ni kaw sharin ya ai French madang** (The standard of French taught in schools) - This is what the Belgian and Swiss speakers need to learn *to match* France, implying it's different by default.

Therefore, only option D directly aligns with the information provided in the passage.
"
Kaning re mabyin masa hta tinang gaw yawn hkyen shayawm manu n lu chye rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Third-party magam malai pyenli hpaga hpung hte kalang ta tau hkrau lakmat mari yang**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""masha tsi ai hkrum lam a hpang chyhtum aten a manu sha kachyi mi shayawm ya ai. U.S dai nrai Canada, ngut nna WestJet kaw na npawt wa ai Air Canada, Delta Air Line, Lufthansa ni lawm ai ni hpe jaw da ai nbungli bungli."" This means discounts are offered after medical treatment, and specifically for airlines like WestJet, Air Canada, Delta, and Lufthansa.

* **The passage implies:** The discount is *not* available if you are not booking directly through these airlines. Booking through a third party removes you from their direct system and the associated medical discount.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: WestJet hte pyen hkawm yang:** The passage states the discount IS available on WestJet.

*   **C: Lufthansa hte Paris kaw na United States du hkra pyen hkawm yang:** The passage states the discount IS available on Lufthansa.

*   **D: Delta hte pyen hkawm yang:** The passage states the discount IS available on Delta."
Yawn hkyen shayawm manu hte seng nna gara wa jaw rai?,"The passage says ""...hpang chyhtum aten a manu sha kachyi mi shayawm ya ai."" which translates to ""...reduce the cost of last minute/final tickets by a little.""

The best answer that matches this is:

*   **C: Hpang chyhtum aten na manu hpe lu makawp ai** (Which translates to: Is able to maintain the last minute price)

**Therefore, the correct answer is C.**
"
Galoi ten hta langai hkrai lang GPS gaw lam madun ai GPS app hta grau htuk manu ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Masat da ai a shinggan de sa na rai yang (If you are going outside of coverage area)**

Here's why:

* **The premise clearly states that single-use GPS devices are preferable when you are going outside of internet coverage.**  The passage says ""...Lama na nang na phone kaw internet hte matut ya ai lam nnga yang gaw, masat da ai a shinggan de rai taw yang gaw shanhte a bungli galaw ai lam ni gaw shadang masat tawn hkrum mai ai nlu lang wa chye ai re."" which translates to ""If you don't have internet connectivity on your phone, and you are outside of coverage, then their functions may not be reliable and not usable."" This is when a dedicated GPS would be better.
Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: Gumhpraw mahkawng na matu shakut taw yang (If you are trying to save money):** The passage does mention affordability, but it states that smartphone apps are generally more affordable.
*   **B: Tinang hta phone kaw internet hte matut ya ai lam nga na re ngu teng yang (If you are sure to have internet connectivity on your phone):** The passage implies that app-based GPS is good when you have internet.
*   **D: Jak rai n kam shap yang (If you don't want complications):** This is not the correct answer. Although app-based navigation is generally easy, the passage does not explicitly mention which device is easier to use.

**Therefore, C is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.**"
Langai hkrai lang GPS hpe ning hkap nna lam madun ai GPS hpe lang na matu madi madun kaja n re ai rai?,"The passage argues that using a smartphone with a GPS app is a cheap and easy way to navigate when you are out of your country. However, it also mentions a drawback: if you don't have internet access, the GPS may not work properly outside of designated areas.

The question asks if using a standalone GPS is a good alternative to a smartphone GPS app.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Phone kaw internet hte matut na lam hpe myit n'tsang ra yang (If you don't want to worry about phone internet connectivity)** This is the most relevant point from the passage. The main disadvantage of the smartphone app is the dependence on internet connectivity. If you don't want to rely on it, a standalone GPS is a good alternative.
*   **B: Gumhpraw mahkawng mayu yang (If you want to save money)** The passage suggests that smartphone GPS apps are a cheap option compared to buying standalone GPS devices or expensive maps. This is contradictory to the question.
*   **C: Shap sha ai lam hpe koi yen mayu yang (If you want to avoid sharing information)** The passage mentions that car companies might collect information from standalone GPS devices. Avoiding data collection is a reason to consider a smartphone or avoid data collection altogether, which is not the main purpose.
*   **D: Lamu ga sumla nnan mari n ra yang (If you don't want to buy new maps)** The passage mentions that a smartphone app will allow you to save money to purchase a new map.

Therefore, the best answer is **A**.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, tinang hte htap htuk ai sanghpaw hte re ngu gara hku pahkam hkam lu na rai?","The best answer is **C: Galapagos bu hkawm magam hta alak kaja ai kasa hte tau hkrau latmak mari na**.

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes that the travel agent should be a ""Galapagos specialist who knows the ships well."" This aligns directly with option C.
*   The prompt asks for a way to ensure you get a ship that is suitable for you. A Galapagos specialist would know which ships cater to different interests and preferences.
*   Options A, B, and D are good practices for booking a Galapagos cruise in general, but they don't specifically address how to find a ship that is the best fit for *you*."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, du sa manam ni hpaida matut ginsup na matu gara lai ladat hpe n jai lang ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Bungjat luhpa ni**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nkau shara ni gaw nta kaw luhpa tsa ni lajang da ai. Timung, tsa nang ai gaw daw dan lam hpe jashut ya ai, dai majaw hpai chye da ai ni gaw tsa nnang ai sha ginsup na ahkyak ai lam chye da ai.""  This translates to ""Some places prepare alcoholic drinks at home. But, drinking alcohol confuses decisions, so those who can carry (drink) know that it's important to entertain without drinking alcohol.""

This clearly indicates that alcohol is *not* the method used to effectively entertain guests, as it can impair their judgment. The other options are not mentioned in the provided text.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, ram ai hpaida ginsup ai wa gaw kaning re hpe koi yen na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Tsa grai lu ai** (Drinking too much alcohol).

The passage states that alcohol intoxication can cloud judgment, so experienced players know to avoid playing while drunk. The question asks what an experienced player avoids.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, laika yen ka'ang hta gara lik tara dawsang hpe laika si kaba hte lang ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Shingteng ni**

The passage explicitly states that proper nouns (Shingteng mying ni) always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, shingteng hpe laika si kaba hte ka ai gaw hpa hpe grau yak shangun ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Laika ka yang**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...laika ka ai lam hta gaw hkrang langai a ga shabyin ni, shingteng shadan ni gara hku lang da ai hpe chye ra ai majaw loi yak ai hpe mu lu ai."" This translates to: ""...in writing, it is seen as more difficult because one needs to know how the actions of a subject and the proper nouns are used.""

The passage explicitly says that using capital letters for proper nouns *makes writing more difficult* because you need to understand how subjects, actions, and proper nouns are being used. While it makes reading easier by distinguishing proper nouns, it complicates the writing process.
"
"""Malaysia kahtawng ningchyawng shara ni kaw, gara lagaw lata kumla gaw """"sa wa u le"""" ngu ai rai?""","The correct answer is **A: Yunglat hpe kahpam magaw ai**

The passage states: ""...Malaysia kaw, buga ginra hkan na yawm htum Malay masha ni lapran hkan gaw, yunglat hpe hkum maga magaw dan ai de lachyum gaw ""sa wa u le"" ngu nna..."" which translates to: ""...in Malaysia, especially among some Malay people in rural areas, clenching the fist with the thumb tucked inside means ""go away!""...""
"
"""Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara lagaw lata kumla gaw """"bai sa wa u"""" nga tsun ai rai?""","The correct answer is **B: Yunglat hpe kahpam magaw ai** because the passage specifically mentions that in Malaysia, among at least some Malay people, folding the hand with the thumb tucked in means ""go away.""
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, hkyen ugang ga kaprang hpa majaw byin ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Zim sha n'nga ai hkyen hka ni**.

Here's why:

This directly translates to: ""Glacier rivers are not still and can flow down the mountains. These things destroy glacier debris and can cause landslides and erosion."" This explains that moving glacier water is a cause of landslides.
The other options are related to the issue, but the core, direct cause of erosion and landslides from the provided text is the moving glacial water.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw hkyen mahkrai ni hku na magap da mai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Ga ai lam ni**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage clearly states that landslides are caused by heavy rain and can damage vegetation (hkyen mahkrai).**

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hka ge lung pu ni (Caves):** While the passage mentions caves being damaged, they are not directly related to protecting vegetation.
*   **C: Shakum ni (Peaks):** Peaks are part of the terrain, not something that protects vegetation from landslides.
*   **D: Tawng kaba ni (Large Ponds):** Large ponds are the result of landslides, not a means of preventing them or protecting vegetation."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, bu hkawn ai ni hku na gara shara de bu hkawm yang bungjat shawng sadi jaw ai lam hpe hkan nang ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Goma grupyin shara ni**

The text states, ""Goma gaw shimlum nga ai, Goma a shinggan de sa du hkawm na re yang gaw dingdung Kivu ginra kaw na matut manoi gasat ai lam ni hpe shawng chye na da rai ai lam gaw ahkyak nga ai."" This clearly advises caution when traveling outside of Goma itself, to the surrounding areas.
"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Goma kaw na mungkan bu hkawn ai wa na matu kaja ai ga machyan n re ai rai?,"The answer is **D: Nyiragongo wanbum na htumpa gaw mare kata hta nga ai** (The lava from the Nyiragongo volcano is located in the city).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the lava flow from the 2002 eruption destroyed part of the city, implying the lava is *not* currently inside the city anymore. It was a past event that caused damage.

The other options are all supported by the text:

*   **A: North Kivu na gasat gala ai ni shangwi shapyaw taw nga ai** (There is ongoing conflict in North Kivu): The passage mentions ongoing conflicts in North Kivu as something to be aware of when traveling outside Goma.
*   **B: Manu hkyam sa Gorilla Bum lung na matu kaja ai shara re** (A good place to go to see the inexpensive gorillas): The passage says Goma is near the affordable mountain gorilla trekking.
*   **C: Mawdaw sengke ni gaw hkawm sa matu kaja ai** (Motorcycles are a good way to travel): The passage recommends using ""boda-bodas"" (motorcycle taxis) for getting around."
August shata na shawng hpang shani na matu laksan ahkang jaw latmat galoi mai lu na rai?,"The passage states: ""The permits are available on the 1st of the month, four months in advance of the month you wish to go.""

You want a permit for a trip starting in August. Four months prior to August is April.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: April shata 1st ya**.
"
Canyon hpe makawp na matu hpa hkrang tara hpe jahkrat da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Shadang masat da ai ahkaw ahkang**.

Here's why:

* The passage states you need a ""laksan ahkang jaw lakmat"" (special permit) to camp in certain areas of the Grand Canyon, indicating a quota or limited permit system.
* It mentions that permits are issued months in advance and popular sites fill up quickly, further suggesting a limited, allocated permit system.
* The term ""shadang masat da ai ahkaw ahkang"" translates to ""allocated permits,"" which accurately reflects the system described in the passage.
* The passage emphasizes that the ahkaw ahkang jaw ai ni gaw shadaw sharam nga ai. Dai gaw (Allocation of permit is mandatory).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shawng du, shawng htet ahkaw ahkang masa (First come, first served)**: Dai hku nga yang gaw Bright Angel Campground ni hta law malawng karum hpyi ai ni a majaw shawng nnan nhtoi hta jahpan hpring ai nga ai. (The passage states that popular campsites like Bright Angel Campground fill up fast on the first day due to high demand). This means it's not purely first-come, first-served, there's a system in place *before* that day to allocate permits.

*   **B: January shata 1st ya kaw sha ahkaw ahkang mai lu ai (Permits are only available on January 1st)**:  The passage specifically says you can apply for permits ""shata mali jau na mai lu ai"" (four months in advance).

*   **C: Walk-in hku na hpyi lajin ai sha ahkaw ahkang mai lu ai (Permits are only available by walk-in application)**: The passage mentions ""walk-in shawng htet ai lam hta mare kade ngu galaw da ai re"" (a quota is set for walk-in applications), but it *doesn't* say that's the *only* way to get a permit. It actually seems to be the last resort or only if there are remaining permits available.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai manam dap hpan ni hta, lawu kaw na gara hpe mu na masa yawm dik rai?","The passage describes a type of elite, wealthy group (the ""manam jarik"") that enjoys luxury and travel, especially during a time before widespread technology. Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: Tsa gayau bar (Tea/cocktail bar):** The passage mentions that these people enjoy fine meals and leisurely evenings. A bar would fit into that description.

*   **B: Manam dap kaw lusha kaja mai lu ai seng (Good food at the ""manam dap""):** The passage specifically says that they have good food and a pleasant atmosphere during the day and evening.

*   **C: mying kaba ai (sh)matsing masat hkrum ai manang manam ni (Famous friends and acquaintances):** The passage mentions that they sometimes visit important figures in the country.

*   **D: Prat dep madang sharawt da ai hte gram shatsawm da ai yup gawk ni (Modernized and renovated rooms):** The passage explicitly says that they *lack* modern amenities and ostentatious displays of wealth. The essence of their style is simplicity and unique elegance, not modern luxuries.

Therefore, the least likely thing to find in these ""manam dap"" would be:

**D: Prat dep madang sharawt da ai hte gram shatsawm da ai yup gawk ni**
"
"Laika hta tang madun da ai zawn, lawu kaw na sak jaw ai ni hta manam masha ni hku na ningshawng jaw masat na yawm dik gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **B: mying gumhkawng ai shat ndup wa hte lusha seng.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""dai kaw shana shat ni kaja ai ngut nna shana mung grai pyaw ai re"" which translates to ""Their dinners were good and their nights were pleasant."" This implies a focus on fine dining and good food as a characteristic of these prominent guests. The other options are related but not as directly and strongly emphasized as the quality of their meals and evenings.
"
"Laika hta tang madun da ai zawn, Greenland de bu hkawm ai ni hku nna hpa hpe koi yen ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: ""Greenland mungchying sha ni hpe """"Eskimo"""" ngu na lakap ai""**

Here's why:

*   The text specifically states that while ""Eskimo"" might be acceptable in some US contexts, many non-US people consider it offensive and that visitors should avoid using it when speaking to Greenlandic guides.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Upadi tawt lai ai amu shadang tsaw ai shara nkau mi**: The text mentions that extreme areas or high-crime areas are rare in Greenland.
*   **B: Du hkra ladaw gaw shaning tup alum ala re majaw, htat ai hpun palawng ni gun sa wa na**: The text mentions the cold climate and suggests bringing warm clothes, especially when visiting in the winter.
*   **C: Internet matut mahkai ai lam gaw kaprip kaprap re majaw, dai shara kaw bungli galaw na myit mada ai**: The text says Greenland has excellent internet access (93% of the population) due to fiber optic cables and satellite technology."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw Greenland de sa du ai jau hkyen lajang da lam n'nga ai bu hkawm ni na matu mayak kaba byin na lam grau dik rai?","The correct answer is **C: Lamu marang masa**.

The passage states: ""Katsi ai lamu marang masa gaw hkyen lajang da ai lam n nga ai ni hkrum sha chye ai shoihpa langai rai nga ai."" This directly translates to ""The cold weather is a danger that unprepared travelers may encounter."" The other options are mentioned in the passage, but are not explicitly described as a potential danger for unprepared travelers.
"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw madung gat ginra hku nna jai lang taw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

The passage states that ""Ya gaw dai gaw madung gat kaba zawn rai taw sai"" which translates to ""Now it is acting like a central plaza.""  ""Dai"" refers to Jardin de la Union.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara hpe Jardín de la Unión kaw n mu lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Ma Ma jawng htingnu dingsa**.

The text states that the Jardin de la Unión **was** a 17th-century church (Ma Ma nawku jawng), and is now a main plaza (madung gat kaba). It no longer functions as a church. The other options are all mentioned as things you can find at the Jardin de la Unión.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, shani bum lung ai hte seng nna lawu kaw na gara gaw n jaw ai ngu sawn la na rai?","Let's analyze each option based on the provided text:

*   **A: Loi ai lam kaw shani bum lung na matu shajin ra lam kaji kajaw sha ra ai** (For easy trails, only minimal preparation is needed for a day hike) The passage states ""Lani mi lung ra ai bum de lung na matu shaman shakyang ai lam galaw ra nga ai"" (Preparation is needed to climb the mountain in one day). This directly contradicts option A, so **A is incorrect**.

*   **B: Tsan gang shadang n bung ai, raitim lani mi aten law ai** (The distance is not fixed, but there is plenty of time in one day) The passage says ""Shani hkan bum lung ai lam ni gaw deng mi hta shau nna lani mi hta lu hkam na daram hkawm sa mai ai tsan shadang rai nga ai"". This indicates a potentially variable distance doable within a day. So, this option appears to aligns with the passage, making it more likely to be correct.

*   **C: Ndai bungli hpe hkam kaja ai lam ram daw nga ai masha ni gaw galaw pyaw na re** (People who are healthy enough will enjoy this activity) The passage states ""hkam ja ai masha ni sha mai shang lawm nga ai"" (only healthy people can participate). This supports option C.

*   **D: Ma ngai hte re kun dinnghku ni na matu shani bum lung ai gaw htuk ai shinggan bungli n re** (Day hiking is not suitable outdoor activity for families with babies) The passage indicates that families with young children may find it more challenging: ""Ma kasha nga ai nta masha ni gaw grau lazang da ra ai"" (Families with children need to be more careful). This supports option D.

The question asks which statement is **incorrect**. Option A directly contradicts the passage, while options B, C, and D align with the text.

**Therefore, the answer is A.**"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, shani bum lung na matu shajin ra lam kaji kajaw galoi ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Bum lung ai wa gaw hkumhkrang hte seng nna hkam kaja yang** (If the person climbing the mountain is physically healthy).

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""...lani mi lung ra ai bum de lung na matu shaman shakyang ai lam galaw ra nga ai rai nna hkam ja ai masha ni sha mai shang lawm nga ai."" This translates to ""...to climb the mountain in a day, preparation is needed, and only healthy people can participate.""

The question asks when preparations are needed for a day climb, and the text directly states this is necessary when the climber is physically healthy. The other options aren't the *reason* for preparation, but potential contributing factors to difficulty.
"
Rogaland (sh) Agder kaw bumpa layang hte seng nna Norway hte shing daw yang hpa baw shai ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Shanhte hpe law malawng heta hpun ka'up da ai**

Here's why:

* The passage states that in Rogaland and Agder, the bumpa layang (highlands) are often called ""hei,"" which means ""open, treeless moorland covered with heather."" This directly supports that they are covered in heather.
* The other options are incorrect according to the passage.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw Norway a matu ding ngam n re ai rai?","The text describes the following features of Norway:

*   **Panglai hkai gai hte kadit hkam wam lai lai nna, grau nna gaw bumpa layang hta grau tsaw ai shara re:** Coastal regions, valleys, and mountainous plateaus.
*   **bumpa layang ni gaw... """"""""vidde"""""""" zawn re ai... dam lada ai, hpun ni n-nga na mahka taw ai ginra:** Plateaus that are vast, treeless, and barren.
*   **Rogaland hte Agder hta shanhte gaw ayan na """"""""hei"""""""" ngu shaga ai, lachyum gaw heta hpun ka'up da ai hpun ntu ai prang ga ngu ai re:** Heaths (open uncultivated land with heather and low shrubs)

Therefore:

*   **A: Dam lada ai hkarang ga ni (Vast forests):** The text explicitly states the plateaus are TREEELESS. So, this is likely incorrect.
*   **B: Maling bumpa layang ni (Mountainous plateaus):** The text mentions them
*   **C: Grau dingchyung ai panglai hkai gai ni (Coastal regions):** The text mentions them
*   **D: Prang ga ni (Heaths):** The text mentions them.

Since the description emphasizes that the plateaus lack trees, vast forests would be the least representative of the described Norwegian landscape.

So the answer is **A: Dam lada ai hkarang ga ni**
"
Hkyen jawn ai hpe myit lawm ai bu hkawm masha gaw galoi ten hta kawng dabang ni hkan du hkawm ging ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Nshung ta laman (Summer season)**.

Here's why:

* The passage describes activities suitable for pleasant weather (""kashung ta hta hkyen hkrat shadang hkrak ai bum dabang ni hte"" - mountain slopes ideal for mild temperatures). Riding horses and other outdoor activities are better suited for milder temperatures found during the summer season.
* The other seasons (Rainy, Winter, and Autumn) are less suitable for enjoying outdoor activities in the mountains due to rain, cold, or less predictability in weather.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, bu hkawm ai ni gaw bum dabang hta shawoi na zawn galoi nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: India kahtet ta laman**

The passage (P) states that the mountain resorts are for people traveling to India *during the summer*. ""India kaw na kahtet ta hta sa chyai ai ni a matu bum nta kaw na shara de sa ai"". So the time frame is *during the Indian summer*.
"
Tinang gaw karum na matu tam hkawm taw li hpe mu na matu myit mada yang hpa hpe koi yen ra na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: sanghpaw daru hta lahta lawu lam hkawm taw ai**

The passage implies you should be actively seeking to help, network, and advertise yourself to find a ship. Walking aimlessly around the docks doesn't fit this proactive approach and wouldn't be effective in finding opportunities. The other options are aligned with what the text suggests you should do.
"
Tinang gaw karum na ra taw nga ai li hpe tam hkawm yang li daru makau kaw hpa galaw ging ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: sanghpaw la ni hte matut mahkai lam galaw na**.

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""Nang laga sanghpaw hkan jawng ai masha ni hte hkrum wa na re ai hte shanhte ni shanhte a shiga ni hpe nang hpe garan gachyan ya na ra ai."" (You will meet people sailing on other ships and they will share their stories with you.) And ""seng ni hkan shanghpaw li masha ni hte matut mahkai na shakut nga ai lam zawn re ni hpe madun ai ndau laika ni hpe nang law law galaw wa ra na re."" (You should create lots of announcements that show things like trying to contact ship crew at the docks).

The other options are not explicitly supported by the passage, or even contradict it.
"

This refers to the northern waterfront, described earlier as ""Hong Kong zunlawng na mare bawng ring lam a malawng maga hpe bai hpyi la da ai dingdung de na panglai hka kau mayan ni hta masha law law shanga na matu re."" which translates to ""The northern waterfront, which reclaims much of the urban development of Hong Kong Island, is where many people gather.""

Therefore, the answer is **A: Dingdung panglai hka kau** (Northern waterfront).
"
Mauhpa ningmu ginra hpe ningshawng jaw ai mungkan bu hkawm ai wa hpe kaning re shara gaw shalen na rai?,"The passage states that many tourists consider Hong Kong Island a primary location. The passage also mentions that to see the best views, you should leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront.

The question asks which place would delight a world traveler who appreciates iconic views. While Hong Kong overall is a good answer, the passage specifically notes that **Kowloon waterfront** offers the best views of Hong Kong Island's skyline and surrounding nature.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Kowloon hka kau lam** (Kowloon waterfront).
"
Nkau gumra hking kaw jawn ai wa na lagaw gumra lagaw labye kaw dau na shoihpa yawm na matu karum ya ai baw hpa nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: shim ai bar shadawn ni** (safe stirrups).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that ""gumra hking nkau, Inglik gumra hking ni hta galeng jawn ai wa hpang hku agang yang gumra hking gabye na matu hkrak re ai shim ai bar shadaw ni lawm ai"" (some saddles, English saddles, include safety bars designed to release the stirrup if the rider falls). This directly addresses how to reduce the risk of a rider's foot getting caught.
*   The other options don't match the information provided in the passage."
Jawn buk hkyepdin na gara hkrang nsam gaw gumra lagaw labye jai lang ai shaloi jawn ai wa na shim lam hpe karum sharawt ra ai rai?,"The answer is **A: maja ai, gyip ai laga lahpan** (tight, secure stirrups).

Here's why:

* **The problem:** The passage describes the danger of a rider's foot getting caught in the stirrups when falling off a horse. This can lead to being dragged and injured.
* **The solution:** The passage suggests safety precautions to reduce this risk.
* **Tight Stirrups:** While counterintuitive at first, ""tight stirrups"" (maja ai, gyip ai laga lahpan) are actually safer. If the stirrup is too loose, the foot can slide too far in, increasing the likelihood of getting stuck. A snug fit allows the foot to release more easily in a fall.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: shan hpyi (silk)** - The material of the stirrup doesn't directly impact safety.
* **C: lagaw lahtin (short legs)** - The length of the rider's legs doesn't directly impact stirrup safety.
* **D: dam lada ai lagaw lahpan (wide stirrups)** - Wide stirrups would actually *increase* the risk of a foot sliding too far in and getting trapped.

Galai yu gawn zinghkri kaw na bu hkawm ai ni hpe hpa baw jaw ai rai?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: buga masha ni hte manam gawk**.

The passage describes Couchsurfing (Galai yu gawn ai zinghkri) as a platform that connects travelers with locals, allowing them to stay in the homes of those locals. This is reflected in option A, which translates to ""guest rooms with local people."" The other options are incorrect because the text doesn't explicitly state they're provided by Couchsurfing:
*   **B: manu hkyem sa ai nbungli ni**: The passage mentions Casey Fenton finding a cheap flight, but Couchsurfing itself doesn't guarantee or provide cheap flights.
*   **C: buga lam woi ai ni hku na woi awn ai ginwang kawan hkrun lam**: The text focuses on accommodation, not guided tours.
*   **D: shara langai sha bu hkawm ai masha ni hte matut mahkai ai lam**: While Couchsurfing facilitates connections, the primary benefit described in the text is the accommodation aspect."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, galai yu gawn zinghkri hte seng nna lawu kaw na gara gaw n jaw ai rai?","The incorrect statement according to the text is **A: bu hkawm ai ni hpe galoi ma buga manam tau ai ni hte madi madun ai lam galaw ya ai**

Here's why:

*   The text states that Couchsurfing *connects* travelers with locals who offer accommodation, but it doesn't say they *always* introduce or support travelers to local hosts. It is up to the travelers to connect themselves with the host.

The other options are supported by the text:

*   **B: Nkau zinghkri ni gaw bu hkawm ai ni a bungjat tengman ai lam madun na ra rawng ai:** The text mentions that some online platforms require validation of identity.
*   **C: Yaw shada da ai mare kaw na lu mai ai buga masha jahpan hpe bu hkawm ai ni hpe jaw ai:** The text mentions that platforms provide a list of hosts in the target city.
*   **D: bu hkawm masha ni kalang marang buga masha ni a dinglun maram yu ai lam ni mai lu ai:** The text mentions that the support or opinions from the travelers are sometimes used."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gumbum jarawp gawk kaw gara manam hpan hpe mu lu na matu mai byin ai lam yawm dik rai?","The answer is **C: ma kaji ni hte bu hkawm ai manam**.

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""Ma nga ai dinghku ni gaw yu hpa shara atsawm nmu ma ai, raitim jarawp nkau mi gaw shanhte hpe laksan gawk ni hta nga na ahkang jaw ma ai."" (Families with children usually don't find a place, but some hostels will let them stay in private rooms). This clearly indicates that families with young children are the *least* likely type of guest to be commonly found in a general hostel setting.  While they *might* be in private rooms at some hostels, it's not the norm.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely to be the *least* common:

*   **A: asak hkun ning shawng manam (younger traveler):** P explicitly states hostels are primarily for young people (ramma ni a matu lajang ya ai).
*   **B: tinang hkrai bu hkawm ai manam (solo traveler):**  Hostels are often popular with solo travelers of all ages.
*   **D: asak sumshi ning ka'ang na manam (older traveler):** P states, ""nang gaw hkrun lam hkawm ai asak kaba masha ni hpe mung dai hta jahkring hkring mu ai,"" (you also see older travelers staying there).

Therefore, families with young children are the least likely to be found in a general hostel setting."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, jarawp manam dap kaw kadai nga byin na law dik htum rai?","The passage states:

*   Hostels mainly cater to young people.
*   A common client is a solo traveler.
*   Older travelers are also sometimes seen.
*   Families with children are not a common sight, but some hostels do accommodate them in private rooms.

Based on this, the most likely group to be found in a hostel would be:

*   **B: asak 22 ning re ai arau bu hkawm ai masha masum** (Three people traveling together in their 20s)

**Reasoning:**

*   **Option A:** While some hostels might allow families, they are not a common sight, as per the passage.
*   **Option C:** Older couples do stay sometimes, but hostels are mainly for young people.
*   **Option D:** Similar to option A, families are less common.
*   **Option B:** This is the closest description to the hostel's target audience (young people traveling alone or in small groups).

Therefore, the most probable answer is **B**."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw gawngwai laknak kabai ai lam hpe tup hkrak lu tsun dan ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: jaw ai hku kabai yang dai gaw tinang lata de bai wa ai** (if you throw it correctly, it will come back to your hand).

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Australia hta mai lu ai Boomerang malawng gaw kaja nga yang bai nhtang nwa ai baw re."" This translates to ""Most Boomerangs available in Australia, if good, are the kind that return."" This directly supports option A.
*   The other options are not directly supported by the text:
    *   **B:** The passage mentions gawngwai laknak kabai ai lam gaw mungkan bu hkawm masha grai law wa hkaja la mayu ai mying gumhkawng ai kungkyang lam langai mi rai nga ai, which states that ""Gawngwai laknak gabai ai lam gaw mungkan bu hkawm masha grai law wa hkaja la mayu ai mying gumhkawng ai kungkyang lam langai mi rai nga ai."" (The art of throwing boomerangs is a skill that many tourists want to learn.) It doesn't compare its popularity between locals and tourists.
    *   **C:** The text implies boomerangs *are* available in Australia.
    *   **D:** The passage says ""Most Boomerangs available in Australia, if good, are the kind that return."" This doesn't directly align with ""only some boomerangs can return."""
Javanese shat shamai hta lawu kaw na gara hpe dan leng ai namchyim hku na jai lang ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: ma-un jumdwi**.

The passage specifically mentions ""Javanese a dan leng ai namchyim rai nga ai nawhkun, majap, jum dwi (grau nna gaw Javanese ma-un jum dwi)...""  This clearly identifies *ma-un jum dwi* as a prominent spice in Javanese cuisine.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, ana kap chye ai contagious gaw gara hku chyam bra ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: ana kap ai masha** (a person who is infected).

The passage states: ""Kap chye wa ai ana zinli langai gaw ana kap taw ai masha langai ngai a makau kaw nga nga ai shaloi aloi sha kap wa chye ai baw ana re."" (A contagious disease is one that is easily spread when you are near a person who is infected). This directly links contagiousness to proximity to an infected person.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw ana kap loi ai ana hpe n'shabyin ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: makawp maga tsi ni (vaccinations)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that infectious diseases can be caused by pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi.
*   Vaccinations are preventative measures designed to protect against infectious diseases, not to cause them."
"Kaning re mabyin hta, tingkyeng hte seng ai VPN galaw shapraw ai ni hta web proxy hpe lata yang jai lang ai wa a matu grau hkum zup na rai?","The passage states that private VPN providers are superior to web proxies in several ways:

*   They can circumvent both political censorship and commercial IP-geofiltering.
*   They handle all internet traffic, not just HTTP.
*   They often offer better services and higher bandwidth.
*   They are encrypted, making them harder to monitor.

Given this information, let's evaluate the options:

*   **A: jai lang ai wa gaw shiga htinglet ai lam yawng hpe bai byeng mayu yang** - This is a key advantage of VPNs over web proxies, as the passage explicitly states that VPNs can encrypt all internet traffic.

*   **B: jai lang ai wa gaw jep joi ai lam hte kin-yu galaw ai lam hpe dang di ai ram koi yen na matu myit tsang yang** - VPNs are better at avoiding both censorship and monitoring.

*   **C: jai lang ai wa gaw http htinglet ai lam hpe bai byeng mayu yang** - This is where a web proxy *might* be sufficient, as they *can* handle HTTP traffic. However, VPNs are better because they handle all traffic.

*   **D: jai lang ai wa gaw bandwidth tsaw ai hpe ram daw ra ahkyak yang** - VPNs are more likely to offer higher bandwidth.

From the provided information, if the user wants to encrypt ALL traffic, and is concerned about censorship and monitoring, a VPN is clearly the better option. Therefore, A and B will be a good choice.

The best answer would be **A and B**. If only one answer can be selected, then **B** would be more comprehensive, because ""avoiding censorship"" implies encrypting all traffic as well.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw VPN hte web proxies ni hte seng nna n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: VPN ni chyu sha http shiga htinglet ai hpe byeng lu ai**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that VPNs ""bai byeng la ma ai... yawng hpe Internet hting let sa taw ai lam yawng hpe,"" which means they handle all internet traffic, including HTTP. Therefore, the statement that only VPNs can intercept HTTP traffic is false.
The other options are correct statements based on the text:

*   **A: VPN ni gaw web proxies ni hta grau tsaw ai bandwidth hpe jaw ai** - This aligns with ""Ayan shanhte ni grau kaja ai galaw jaw ai hte grau tsaw ai bandwidth jaw ai.""

*   **B: Web proxies ni gaw web shiga htinglet ai lam yawng hpe bai n byeng lu ai** - This is implied by the VPNs being able to intercept all internet traffic, suggesting proxies are limited.

*   **C: Web proxies gaw VPN hte shingdaw yang madang nyam ai galaw jaw ai lam nga ai** -This is aligned with ""Ayan shanhte ni grau kaja ai galaw jaw ai hte"""
Hpa gaw marai langai ngai shanhte a ni dik shara shinggan kaw na phone company hpe jai lang na matu ahkang jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: internet hte lajang da ai shaga ni (internet-based calls)**

The passage states that internet-based calls allow you to appear to be calling from anywhere and not interact with local organizations. The other options don't directly address why someone would use a phone company outside their physical location.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, nka shaga ai ni hpe lu na matu lawu kaw na gara hpe galaw ra na rai?","The correct answer is **A: mungkan nambat hpe mari la na** (buy a global number).

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Chyhkring hkring nang hpe shaga na matu PSTN ga shaga jak ahkang jaw da ai san san garan da ai **mungkan nambat hpe nang mari ra na**."" (To have people call you regularly, you need to buy a separately allocated **global number** authorized for PSTN phone calls). This directly supports option A.

The other options are incorrect based on the passage:

*   **B: buga phone hpaga hpung langai hpe jai lang na** (Use a local phone company): While a local phone company might *offer* such a global number, the text focuses on the *purchase* of the number itself, not necessarily the company providing it. Also the passage states it is for internet calling, so there is no need for a company offering physical phone service.
*   **C: tinang buga rau nga masha hpung kaw na nambat langai hpe lu la na** (Get a number from a local community group): The passage specifically states you *don't* need to be associated with a local group or region to get this number.
*   **D: PSTN phone langai mari la na** (buy a PSTN phone): The passage mentions PSTN in relation to the *number*, not the phone itself. The text is about using internet-based calling, not necessarily needing a traditional PSTN phone.

Therefore, option A is the only one directly and accurately supported by the provided text."
Italy gasi ni a nsen hte seng nna lawu kaw na gara gaw tup hkrak n lu tsun dan ai rai?,"The best answer based on the passage is **D: ga hkum law malawng na nsen shapraw ai lam gaw hpang na vowel hta shamyet shanat taw nga ai.**

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically mentions that *c* and *g*'s pronunciation depends on the following vowel. This is precisely what option D describes - vowel determines pronunciation.

Let's look at why the other options are not as accurate:

*   **A: r langai hta r lahkawng gaw grau na ga nsen shapraw na matu yak ai:** The passage *mentions* the difference in pronunciation between single and double 'r', and gives an example that changes the entire meaning of the word. It doesn't say it's *difficult*, just different and important.
*   **B: ga hkum ni law law hpe shanhte gara hku ka lajang da ai zawn nsen shapraw ai:** While the initial sentence says Italian pronunciation is easier because words are pronounced as they are written, the *example* focuses on how vowel sounds alter the pronunciation of *c* and *g*. Thus it is not the best answer.
*   **C: laika c hte g lawm ai ga hkum ni gaw yak ai:** The passage doesn't say *c* and *g* are inherently difficult. It just says their pronunciation *changes* depending on the following vowel. This is just the issue of needing to understand pronunciation rules, not a case of difficulty.

**In Summary:** The passage directly links the pronunciation of *c* and *g* to the following vowel, making option D the most accurate reflection of the information provided."
lawu kaw na Izmir a laklai ai gara kumla gaw prat dep shani a shawng hta nnan byin wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: gat kaba ni**.

The passage mentions ""kade nde hpun kaba tu ai lam kaba ni, pat hte galaw da ai htingtsip ni hte prat dap gat ginra ni hpe tsa ban 18 ning na gat, Moslim nawku htingnu hte nawku jawng dingsa ni hte ka'up tsawm taw nga ai."" This part describes the blending of old and new, specifically mentioning *gat kaba ni* (large markets) as a feature alongside older mosques and schools.
"
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, Izmir na tup hkrak laklai kumla n re ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: U Magwi hta nambat lahkawng kaba dik ai sanghpaw daru**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states Izmir is the *second-largest* port in Turkey after Istanbul, not in ""U Magwi"" (Europe).
*   The passage clearly mentions that the city is located on the Aegean Coast.
*   The passage describes modern commerce, historical mosques, churches and synagogues.

So, D is the only factually incorrect statement based on the provided text."
gasi hanami gaw hpa baw yu chyai ai ngu madi madun ai rai?,"The passage states ""Cherry nampan ni pu wa ai hpe yu chyai ai gaw... hanami ngu mung chye da ma ai.""  This directly translates to ""Observing cherry blossoms blooming is... also known as hanami.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Cherry nampan ni pu ai**
"
Cherry nampan pu ai hpe yu chyai ai poi lamang hpe kadai ni hpang wa sai rai?,"The passage states: ""Japan kaw, alat ningshawng byin hpun pu ai lam lamang hpe hkawngseng magam nan shi hkum shi a matu hte laga hkawseng mungdan hte seng ai hkaw hkam hkaw makau na du magam uphkang masa a hpung shang masha ni a matu madu tai na galaw lai wa sai re.""

This translates to: ""In Japan, the earliest cherry blossom viewing events were mainly organized by the imperial court itself and for members of the aristocracy and officials related to other imperial countries.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Japan hkawseng magam (Japan imperial court)**
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na Yerusalem a gara mawn nsam gaw maigan bu hkawm ai ni hpe ra sharawng hkra galaw ya na yawm dik rai?","The passage states: ""Yerusalem gaw labau lam, labu htu sagawn lam hte htunghking hte seng ai shara law law nga ai, dai hta n-ga gat ka'ang seng ni, kohpi hte lusha seng ni hpring kamawg ai shara mung re. Yerusalem gaw Israela mung na bu hkawm shara ni a madung kaw lawm nga ai...mare ginwang a laksan shara ni a majaw"".
This supports options A and D. However, the question asks for the *least* persuasive aspect for attracting foreign tourists. Of the two options:

*   **A: mare na nawku htung hte seng ai ahkyak kumla** (The city's religious significance) - This IS specifically mentioned as attracting tourists.

*   **D: labau shang shara law law** (The many historical sites) - This IS also specifically mentioned as attracting tourists.

Since the question asks for the least persuasive, we need to infer which of the remaining aspects is the *least* relevant for encouraging foreign tourism.

*   **B: Israel a mare ninghpum ngu ai arawng ningsang** (Its status as Israel's capital) - While the passage notes that the status is in dispute internationally, this isn't explicitly mentioned as a draw for *tourists*.

*   **C: shi a htunghking hte seng ai sak jaw ai lam** (Its cultural sacrifice) - The passage doesn't mention this.

Option B is mentioned only to add context to the political climate surrounding Yerusalem, it is not directly mentioned in any way as something drawing in tourism.

Thus, the answer must be:

**B**"
Lawu kaw na gara hpe Yerusalem a gumhkawng ai lama hku nna n tang madun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: mung masa hte seng ai shingkang shingna** (political significance).

Here's why:

*   **A: myit shang sha hpa labau** (fascinating history) - The paragraph explicitly mentions Jerusalem's ""moi shaning sen hku kaw na labau kaja ni"" (rich history of thousands of years).
*   **C: Nawku htung hte seng ai ahkyak kumla** (religious significance) - The paragraph emphasizes that Jerusalem is holy to three religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) and a center of spirituality and faith.
*   **D: htunghking hte seng ai shara ni** (cultural sites) - The paragraph states that Jerusalem has many historical, archaeological, and cultural sites, as well as markets and culinary experiences.

While the passage mentions that other countries and the UN don't recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, it doesn't portray ""political significance"" as a positive or defining characteristic of Jerusalem's glory. It's more of a point of contention. The passage focuses on its historical, religious, and cultural importance."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara bu hkawm masha hpan gaw Wild Card mari ai majaw akyu n nga na rai?","The correct answer is **B: Kruger Amyu sha Nampan sun hpe sha sa du na bu hkawm masha**.

Here's why:

*   The passage says a Wild Card gives access to ""all South African national parks.""
*   If a traveler *only* plans to visit Kruger National Park, they won't benefit from the Wild Card's access to other parks. They would be paying for something they wouldn't use.
*   The other options (A, C, and D) all describe travelers who *would* potentially benefit from a Wild Card because they plan to visit multiple parks, are concerned about entry fees, or are considering at least one other park in addition to Kruger."
Kruger Amyu sha Nampan sun hte seng nna lawu kaw na gara gaw tup hkrak n lu tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Dingda Afrika Amyu sha ni a kaji dik ai Nampan Sun re.**

The passage does not state that Kruger National Park is the smallest national park in South Africa. The other options are supported by information in the passage:

*   **A:** The passage states it is a ""madung myit agang ya ai lam langai re"" (major attraction).
*   **B:** The passage states that the 14 environmental zones support different animal species.
*   **D:** The passage suggests the Wild Card allows access."
Lawu kaw na gara gaw bum a grau dingchyung ai shara shagu hta bum lung ai ni a matu hkrit tsang hpa bying na matu makoi nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: madi ai mabyin masa ni (madi taw ai shaloi)**.

The passage explicitly states that ""grau nna gaw madi taw ai shaloi ndai gaw a-lawan sha hkrit tsang hpa shara byin chye wa ai re (more so when leaning, this can quickly become a scary place)."" This directly links leaning to a potential source of fear for climbers. The other options are just features of the path."
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, laika hta tsun da ai Machu Picchu bum a dingchyung hte seng nan tup hkrak shingnip shingna n lu tsun ai rai?","Let's analyze each option based on the text:

*   **A: hkam kaja lam nga ai bum lung ai ni pyi nsa sa ba wa ai (Even healthy climbers become short of breath)** - The passage *does* imply this. It says that even people in good physical condition can climb it in 45 minutes. The implication is that *not* being in good condition would make it much harder and *could* lead to breathlessness.

*   **B: grau dingchyung ai shara shagu hkan hkraishum ni n nga ai (There are no ropes at every steeper place)** - The passage explicitly states that the stones are placed directly on the slope with handrails made of steel cables installed in sections. Therefore, *not* every steep place has ropes. This statement is in line with the passage.

*   **C: ndung na ginlawng hku hpe lai ra ai (One must pass through a small cave)** - The passage mentions that one must pass through a small cave near the top, implying this statement is true.

*   **D: grau dingchyung ai shara ni gaw madi ai shaloi hkrit tsang hpa byin wa ai (Steeper places become frightening when leaned on)** - The passage says ""grau nna gaw madi taw ai shaloi ndai gaw a-lawan sha hkrit tsang hpa shara byin chye wa ai re"" which means ""the steeper it gets, the more easily this place can become frightening when leaning."" So this is mentioned.

The question asks which statement **cannot** be inferred from the text. Since all the others *can* be inferred, the best answer is **B: grau dingchyung ai shara shagu hkan hkraishum ni n nga ai (There are no ropes at every steeper place)**
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw Majorcan shadu ladat a madung lusha gunrai n re ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: simai simaw**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly mentions **pawngmuk (bread)**, **namlap namlaw (vegetables)**, and **shan (meat)** as primary components of Majorcan cuisine.
*   It also mentions the abundant use of **tsanlun sau (olive oil)**, which is a type of **n-gu (oil)**.
*   **Simai simaw (noodles)** are not mentioned in the description of Majorcan cuisine."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw hangi lusha hte seng nna n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: nlung kahtet lang ai hangi Wellington hta lu mai ai (hangi using heated stones can be found in Wellington)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Kaga hangi ni hpe X'stu Naw ku jawng, Wellington hte kaga shara hkan sha mai lu ai rai tim, Rootua a shara law law kaw geothermal hangi ni hpe jaw nga ai."" This translates to: ""Other hangi can be found in locations such as Auckland and Wellington, however geothermal hangi are common in Rotorua.""

*   This means that the text doesn't explicitly state that hangi using heated stones can be found in Wellington, just that **other** kinds of hangi can be found in Wellington. Whereas, Auckland and Wellington are given as locations where one can find the **other** kinds of hangi.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: ginding kahtet dat hte seng ai hangi gaw nhkun hpe kahtet ya ai wan kaw na nlung kahtet ni hpe akyu nga hkra jai lang ai (a geothermal hangi uses heated rocks from the fire that heats the pit)** - The passage says ""Dai nhkun gaw wan hte kahtet ai nlung hte nat kahtet da ai nhkun mi rai yang, dai nrai lamu ga nan shi shi kahtet ai shara re taw ai nhkun re."" which translates to: ""The pit is either heated by heated rocks from a fire, or it is naturally heated by the earth."" This confirms that the hangi can be using fire-heated stones to heat the pit.
*   **C: kakang ai shana shat ni hpe hangi hpe jai lang nna kalang marang shadu ai (traditional meals are often cooked using hangi)** - The passage states: ""Htunghking hte seng ai kakang da ai malu masha shana shat hpe shadu kachyawng ai hta law malawng gaw hangi hpe lang ai."" which translates to: ""Hangi is often used when preparing traditional meals.""
*   **D: ginding kahtet dat hte seng ai hangi hpe Rotorua hta mai mu ai (geothermal hangi can be found in Rotorua)** - The passage states: ""Rootua a shara law law kaw geothermal hangi ni hpe jaw nga ai."" which translates to: ""Geothermal hangi are common in Rotorua.""

Therefore, option B is the only statement that is NOT explicitly supported by the information in the passage."
Lawu kaw na gara gaw hangi nhkun hpe kahtet na matu ding ngam galaw ai lam hku na n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: dat nsa**.

The passage mentions that hangi pits are heated by:

*   Hot stones heated by fire
*   Geothermal heat

It does not mention gas as a method for heating hangi pits. Therefore, the answer is A."
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, hpung gyi (sh) yahkau num kaw na laksan matsing masat da ai lam lu na rai?","The correct answer is **A: htoi ai nsam hte dumbat hpe hpun ai**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that if women bring their own head coverings (dumbat), especially brightly colored ones, they are more likely to be stopped and questioned (""mani da ya ai"") by the monks or nuns (""yahkau num ni"").

The other options are incorrect because:

*   B: tinang a lahpa hpe magap da ai: The passage states the opposite, that women MUST cover their knees and legs. This is a requirement to enter, not a way to get special attention.
*   C: hpung gyi jawng kaw na dumbat hpe shap ai: The passage says that hpung gyi jawng provide dumbat for women who are not prepared.
*   D: lahput lahta zen da ai bu tawm hpe hpun ai: While men need to wear knee-covering clothing, renting it from the entrance is not explicitly stated to gain negative attention. It just says the clothing available to rent can be uncomfortable.
"
Lawu kaw gara buhpun palawng gaw hpung gyi jawng kaw na n lu shap mai na rai? ,"The correct answer is **B: labu kadun ni** (short pants).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that men need to wear *bu hkra* (long pants/trousers) that cover the knees. Therefore, *labu kadun ni* (short pants) are not allowed and cannot be rented at the temple.
*   *Bu tawm ni* (sarongs) and *dumbat ni* (shawls) are mentioned as items available or required for women.
*   *Bu hkra ni* (long pants/trousers) are specifically mentioned as being what men need to wear and can rent, even if they are used."
Bu hkawm ai masha gaw Antarctic shara de bu hkawm ai shaloi shata ni hpe mu lu na matu kaja dik ahkaw ahkang galoi nga na rai?,"The best answer is **A: ginhtawng shata ni laman**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt states that polar nights occur when the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.** This is most common during the winter months. Therefore, going during ginhtawng shata ni laman will give you the highest probability of seeing the moon (because the sun won't be there to wash it out).
"
Galoi ten hta jak shagan phone gaw cell phone hpe galai bang na matu masa kaja n re ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: jak shagan de line gaw shingdan ai lam rai yang**.

Here's why:

The passage states that satellite phones require a clear line of sight to the satellite. If that line is obstructed (shingdan ai lam rai yang), the phone won't work reliably. The other options are either inherent characteristics of satellite phones or not a reason they would *not* be a good replacement for a cell phone.
"
jak shagan phone hta cell phone hpe galoi grau ra sharawng na rai?,"Based on the passage, a satellite phone is preferable when:

*   You need to communicate from a remote location.

Looking at the options:

*   **B: sanghpaw hte hkrun lam hkawm taw shaloi (while traveling by ship)** - This is the most appropriate answer. Traveling by ship often means being far from land-based cell towers, making satellite phones a better choice.

The other options are incorrect:

*   A: mare langai hta bansa hkawm sa taw shaloi (while walking around a town) - Cell phone service is usually available in towns.
*   C: tsan ai shara na shiga hpe n ra yang (if you don't need distant news) - This is irrelevant; it's about communication, not news.
*   D: tinang hku na alaw alam cell phone lang na mayu mahkoi rai yang (if you prefer to use a standard cell phone) - This is a matter of preference, not a situation where a satellite phone is *required*.

**Therefore, the correct answer is B.**"
Lawu kaw na gara n hkrum n ra ai lam gaw Transnistria gumsan magam mungdan byin wa ai lam de woi wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: amyu bawsang hte seng ai lam** (ethnic tensions).

The passage states: ""Moldova mungdan gaw amyu bawsang hte seng ai kahtik kahtawk ni hkrum sha lai wa nna ya ten hta amyu bawsang law law jawm nga taw ai mungdan langai re. 1994 hta, ndai manghkang gaw sinpraw Moldova hta madu hkrai Transnistria gumsan magam mungdan ngu tinang na tinang ndau la lam de byin wa shangun ai re.""

This translates to: ""Moldova has experienced ethnic tensions and is now a country with many ethnic groups. In 1994, this problem led to the self-declaration of the independent Transnistria republic in eastern Moldova.""

Therefore, ethnic tensions were the primary factor leading to the formation of the Transnistria republic.
"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Transnistria gumsan magam mungdan hte ngam ai Moldova nbung ai rai?  ,"The correct answer is **C: UN matsing masat da ai lam (UN recognition)**

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states:** ""Dai gaw shi na shi asuya hte jai gumhpraw masa lu ai rai tim gara UN hpung shang mungdan ni kaw na gaw masat masa n-galaw ya ma ai."" (It has its own government and currency, but it is not recognized by any UN member states.) This means Transnistria lacks UN recognition, unlike Moldova, which is a UN member.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: tsun shaga ai lam (Language):** The passage mentions Russian language being used significantly in Moldova. Although not explicitly stated about Transnistria, we can infer shared language influence.
*   **B: makam masham hte seng ai lam (Religion):** The passage states the primary religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity. There's no information to suggest Transnistria differs significantly in religion.
*   **D: jai gumhpraw masa (Currency):** The passage says Transnistria has its own currency. This is a difference, but the question asks for something they *share*, not where they differ.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, nbung bung ai masa hpe koi yen mayu ai bu hkawm ai masha hku na Montevideo de galoi sa du ra na rai?","The passage states that Montevideo is in the southern hemisphere. It also mentions that:

*   When the northern hemisphere is cold, Montevideo is hot.
*   Montevideo is not very cold; even in winter, the temperature is around +30°C.
*   Winter is unpleasant due to wind.
*   There isn't a specifically rainy or dry season.

Therefore, to avoid the winter winds of Montevideo, a traveler should visit when it is summer in the southern hemisphere, which is when it is winter in the northern hemisphere.

**Therefore, the correct answer is (C): Dingdung shingwang chyen maga de ginhtawng shata ni laman (Northern hemisphere winter months).**"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, grau katsi ai du hkra ladaw hpe ra sharawng ai rai yang bu hkawm ai masha hku na Montevideo de galoi sa du ra na rai?","The passage states:

*   Montevideo is in the southern hemisphere, so when the northern hemisphere is experiencing winter, Montevideo is experiencing summer.
*   Summer temperatures in Montevideo are around +30˚C.
*   Winter temperatures are below freezing.

The question asks when it would be coldest in Montevideo. Since it's coldest in winter, and winter in Montevideo corresponds to summer in the northern hemisphere, the correct answer is:

**D: Dingdung shingwang chyen maga de nshung ta rai yang** (When it is winter in the northern hemisphere)"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw shawa aurng arai dum nta jahten ya ai hpe ning hkap nna graffiti shingni gaw gap ai hte gunrun na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Graffiti mabyin masa ni**.

Here's why:

* **The passage argues that graffiti is often unfairly associated with vandalism and property damage.**
* **It then states that there is a growing appreciation for graffiti as an art form, with organized events and legal commissions.**

Therefore, the development of graffiti as a legitimate art form and the creation of legal avenues for its expression would naturally serve as a counterargument to the perception that graffiti is solely about vandalism. Options B, C, and D are elements related to graffiti but do not directly address the argument of countering the negative perception of vandalism.
"
Yungwi poi lamang ni a gara lamang gaw nkau poi lawm sa ni ai hku na mahkrum madup a ahkyak ai daw ngu sawn la na rai?,"Based on the information provided in the passage (P), the best answer is **B: dai shara kaw camp galaw ai (camping at the location)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage directly mentions that some festivals create special camping grounds for children and families. This implies that camping at the location is a significant part of the experience for some festival-goers.
*   The passage mentions that if you want to be close to the event you should plan early to find a camping spot, which implies that camping at the location is popular
*   The passage does not say anything about other options being an important part of the experience for festival goers."
"Laika hta tsun da hte maren, poi sa ai masha hku na mahkawn hte nyi ai de camp galaw mayu yang hpa hpe ningshawng jaw ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: jau jau poi de shang ai**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Dai shara hte ni mayu yang, nang mahkawn hte ni ai shara lu na matu jau jau hkyen da ra ai."" This directly translates to ""If you want to be close to the place, you should prepare early to get a place close to the festival.""

The other options are not directly supported by the passage:

*   **A: shana kaw aten lai hkawm sa ai** (Spending time walking around during the day): While exploring is likely part of the experience, it's not stated as a priority for securing a good camping spot.
*   **B: dinghku ni na matu shara kaw nga ai** (Being in a place for families): While some campsites are family-oriented, this isn't the primary advice for securing a spot.
*   **C: shara shinggan kaw camp galaw ai** (Camping outside the area): The passage advises getting *close* to the festival, not camping outside of it.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, dingdung Mexico Nnan kaw shana poi ginra tam ai shaloi bu hkawm ai ni hku nna gara shara hpe koi ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: mare kaji hta nga ai tsa seng** (small-town taverns).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly warns against tsa seng (taverns) in mare kaji (small towns) as unsuitable places for outsiders. It even provides a reason why: local drinking culture might be hostile to outsiders.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, bu hkawm manam masha langai hku nna dingdung Mexico Nnan kaw mying kaba shangwi shapyaw poi hpe gara kaw mahkoi tam mu na rai?","The correct answer is **C: Sante Fe makau kaw na hpaida wang langai kaw**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Spain ga ga ai masha law law nnga mat ai hpang, nang gaw Albuquerque (sh) Santa Fe de ndu hkawm ai sha shana poi ginra lak lai ai namchyim hpe nlu hkam sha na re."" (After the Spanish population has disappeared, you can only experience the unique nightlife by traveling to Albuquerque or Santa Fe). This suggests Albuquerque and Santa Fe areas are the places to go.
*   It further states, ""hpaida wang ni yawng ngu na daram gaw luhpa ni daw jaw ai hte nkau mi gaw mying loi gumhkawng ai shangwi shapyaw ai baw ni jashawn da ma ai (grau kaba ai ni mahtang gaw Albuquerque hte Santa Fe hpe shing grup da ai)."" (Nearly all the haciendas offer lodging and some are known for having good entertainment (the larger ones surround Albuquerque and Santa Fe). So Haciendas near Santa Fe would have the entertainment the question is asking about.
*   **The passage warns against:** Small-town stores (tsa seng) for tourists.

Therefore, a hacienda near Santa Fe is the best option for a tourist seeking entertainment in Northern New Mexico, based on the passage."
Jailang jahpan hpe myit tsang ai bu hkawm ai ni hku nna gara luhpa ntsin hpe koi yen mayu na rai?,"The correct answer is **C: buga lawk beer chyaru**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Buga paik shachyawp hka hpe lu yang teng sha shim ai, raitim nang nhkrit ai rai yang gaw bu na hka gaw tam loi ai."" This translates to something like, ""Drinking local beer is usually safe, however if you don't mind being afraid, you can find beer easily."" This indicates that drinking local beer is safer than other options for beer, suggesting that the other options are not safe.
*   The other options are addressed in the passage, however, the writer does not mention any warnings against them.
    *   Tsabyin jahku: The writer states that other countries are better.
    *   Hka ndum: The writer states that bottled water is easy to find.
    *   Namsi ntsin: The writer states that it is expensive, however it is worth it."
"Laika hta tsun da ai shara hte maren, lawu kaw na gara luhpa ntsin htet ai lam gaw daw jau galaw wa hku nna myit shanut chye rai?","The correct answer is **D: flat white langai**

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Australia masha ni a matu, flat white coffee a hpaji gaw laga mungdan re."" (For Australians, the recipe for a flat white coffee is different in other countries.) This implies there might be a misunderstanding or discrepancy in how a flat white is prepared compared to other countries.
*   The passage elaborates on the flat white, implying there are differences in its composition (espresso, cream, texture, etc.) compared to other coffee drinks.

The other options are less likely to be considered a ""daw jau galaw wa hku nna myit shanut chye rai"" (something that might be made differently):

*   **A: kadun ai a chyang langai**- While the passage contrasts an espresso with a flat white, it doesn't imply that espresso itself is made significantly differently in other places.
*   **B: Number One langai**- The passage refers to this as ""hkrak nna kaja ai"" (correct and good).
*   **C: New Zealand kaw na Sauvignon Blanc langai**- The passage says that New Zealand's wines might be better, but doesn't imply they might be different from what you expect."
"tsa ban masum galu hkra, lamu ga maden je ai aten ladaw hpe gara uhpung ni hpang wa sai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Spain jauman ni**

The passage states: ""Spain jauman ni gaw tsa ban masum dang galu lai wa sai lamu ga maden je ai aten ladaw hpe shawng hpang lai wa sai re."" which translates to ""Spanish colonizers began a three-century-long period of land expansion.""
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Paris masha kaw na warm up lu na matu, gara gaw kaja dik ai lam rai?","The correct answer is **C: sumnung shingdi ai hku nga na**.

The passage states that Parisians can be seen as proud, intelligent, and sophisticated. To fit in, one must act ""bien élevé"" (well-behaved).  Specifically, the passage mentions that if you act politely and show gentleness, the ""scary"" aspects of Parisians will quickly disappear. This directly supports the idea of acting calmly and gently (sumnung shingdi ai hku nga na).
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw Paris mare masha ni a lai chyasi madang ngu nsawn ai rai?","The text describes Parisians as having a reputation for being ""dinghkrai myit madung tawn ai lam, zai ai lam hte grai gawng ai"" (independent-minded, clever/intelligent, and very proud/arrogant).

The question asks which of the following is NOT a characteristic of Parisians according to the text.

*   A: Grai gawng ai (Very proud/arrogant) - This IS a characteristic mentioned in the text.
*   B: Zai ai (Clever/intelligent) - This IS a characteristic mentioned in the text.
*   C: Grai a kam ai (Very confident) - The text does not explicitly mention confidence.
*   D: Dawk dawk nga chye tsun ai (Being able to say things directly/frankly) - The text does not mention about directness.

Therefore, C and D are the most suitable answers, since the text mentions A and B traits of the people of Paris.

However, the most suitable answer among the options is **C: grai a kam ai**, since A and B are clearly mentioned. Option D does not exist in the text.
"
Cape Mare na MetroRail Nambat langai Dum hkum a kaja ai akyu gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **B: masha nau nlaw ai**.

The passage states that MetroPlus (also known as First Class) trains are ""zing ai re nna masha nau nhpring chyat ai re"" which translates to ""fast and not very crowded"". All other options are incorrect based on the given text.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Cape Mare kaw na aten man sumtsan kaw nna bungli sa ai wanleng shagu kaw hpa nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Nambat langai hte Nambat masum wanleng gawk ni**.

Here's why:

* **P (Premise) states:**  ""Wanleng shagu gaw MetroPlus hte wanleng gawk ni nga ai re; Metroplus gawk ni gaw galoi mung Cape Town hte ni dik htum ai wanleng a hpang jahtum de nga ai re.""  Since ""MetroPlus"" means ""Nambat langai Dum hkum"", and ""Metro"" means ""Nambat masum Dum hkum"", this translates to ""Every train has both MetroPlus *and* Metro coaches.""

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A:** The passage states that MetroPlus (Nambat langai) trains are less crowded, *not* Metro (Nambat masum) trains.
* **B:** The passage does not mention second class tickets or their cost.
* **C:** The passage does not mention different numbers.
"
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, jahten latung ni mahkoi n galaw ai gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **D: n-gun lasang hkumhkang machyi byin shangun ai**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that pests can destroy food, cause allergic reactions, spread diseases, and cause infections.
*   Option D talks about causing diseases that can weaken/kill people.

The other options are directly mentioned as things pests *do* cause:

*   A: spreading seeds
*   B: allergic reactions
*   C: spreading disease
"
prepaid phone card ni hpe gara kaw mai mari ai rai?,"The provided text (P) discusses the transition from old telephones requiring coin deposits to modern phones allowing for pre-paid money usage. It mentions that various organizations have customized calling plans for a better user experience. It also says that sometimes calling booths or public phones can be used for calling.

The question (Q) asks where pre-paid phone cards can be bought. 

Based on the context, none of the given options (A, B, C, D) are directly mentioned as places to purchase pre-paid phone cards in the provided text.  The text only mentions using *public phones* or *calling booths* to utilize the specialized calling plans, and *pre-paid phones* in general.

Therefore, *none of the answer choices are directly supported by the text.*  However, ""C: lamjut gatseng ni hta"" (street corners) is the most likely place to find a booth or store that may sell prepaid phone cards compared to the others. But without more information, it's hard to know for sure.
"
Grau kaja ai shaga manu ni hpe nkau cards ni gara hku access galaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: manu jahpu n jaw ra ai nambat ni hku na**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...Ndai galaw jaw ya ai lam ni hpe lu na matu gaw jahpu manu nla ai sha ga shaga jak law malawng kaw na mai shaga ai manu jahpu njaw ra ai ga shaga jak ni hku nna kalang marang mai re."" This directly translates to getting these benefits through free call centers and calling cards at low cost or free.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: masat da ai mungdan ni kaw sha access mai ai** (Only accessible in designated countries) - While some calling cards might have country restrictions, the passage focuses on *how* to access better rates, not *where* you can access them.
* **C: lamjut gatseng hta** (On the street) - This is irrelevant to the passage.
* **D: shawa phone jai lang nna hte bungjat manu jaw nna** (Using public phones and paying extra) - The passage is about *cheaper* calling options, not more expensive ones.

The question asks which tree is *not* likely found there.

A, C, and D are all specifically mentioned as being present. Therefore, the answer must be B.

The correct answer is **B: wamyi hpun** (wine tree).
"
Lawu kaw na gara ginra pra dusat hpe Plitvice Nawng Myu sha Nampan sun hta mu mai ai rai?,"The passage states that Capercaillie can be found in Plitvice Lakes National Park.

Therefore, the answer is **D: Capercaillie**
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, shara code ni gaw hpa hpe karum ya ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: gat lawk renghkang ai lam**.

The passage states that the true purpose of the code is to ""give businesses more control over their platforms"" which directly translates to platform regulation or control.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, shiga dap ni gaw shara code hte seng nna masu ai hpe matut nga da hkun ai gaw hpa rai?","The passage states the news outlets are lying about the purpose of the code because ""The real purpose is to give commercial groups more power over their territories; it's about locking up money.""  Therefore, the best answer is:

*   **A: shanhte hpe gat lawk renghkang ai lam grau lu na matu ra ahkyak ai** (they need more power over territories).

While C is related (""gumhpraw kyi na matu akyu jaw ya ai"" - helps to lock money), A more accurately reflects the increased power dynamic discussed in the passage.
"
"tinang dum nta bu ga de du ai shaloi, gara bungli mahkrun gaw shawoi na zawn yu maya rai?","The correct answer is **B: tinang a rai ni hpe ndau shana ai lam** (declaring your belongings).

Here's why:

* **The prompt (P) discusses:**
    * Checking of name lists/registrations upon returning to your home country.
    * The possibility of customs inspections.
    * The need to declare things legally to avoid issues.

* **Option B directly addresses this:** Declaring belongings is the purpose of customs inspections. You are informing the authorities what you are bringing into the country and ensuring you comply with import regulations.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: masha htawt shang jep ai lam (Immigration checks):** While related to border control, the passage specifically mentions ""ahkun jep shara"" which translates to ""customs checkpoint."" Customs primarily deals with goods, not immigration status.

* **C: tinang na rai a tara shang masat masa (Legal documentation of belongings):** While related, the focus isn't just on having legal documentation *of* your items, but the act of *declaring* them at customs. The prompt emphasizes the action you need to take.

* **D: htung hking renghkang ai lam (Cultural customs/traditions):** This is generally unrelated to customs inspections or declaring belongings.

Therefore, **Option B** is the most accurate and relevant answer based on the given information.
"
tinang a dum nta buga de n du wa shi shaloi lawu kaw na gara hpe chye da ra na rai?,"The question is asking: ""What do you need to know *before* returning to your homeland?""

Let's analyze the options in relation to the original paragraph (P):

*   **A: Lama dai hta mying jahpan jep ai lam nga yang (If there are registration checks there)** - This directly relates to the phrase in P ""Na mungdan de bai du wa ai shaloi mying jahpan jep ai lam hta jep ai nga ai (sh) njep ai ma ga ai"" (When you return to your country, there are registration checks, either yes or no). Knowing this *before* you return is vital.

*   **B: Lama nang gaw tara shang ndau da ai lam ni hta lai na arai ni hpe ndau mayu ai rai yang (If you want to declare items that are not legally declared)** - While related to declarations in P, this is about *what you want to do*, not essential knowledge *before* you arrive.

*   **C: Lama dai hta htung hking renghkang ai lam nga yang (If there are cultural restrictions there)** -  While important in general, the paragraph P doesn't explicitly talk about cultural restrictions that need to be known ahead of time.

*   **D: Lama tinang la wa ai rai ni hpe ahkang n jaw da ai rai yang (If the things you are bringing are not allowed)** - While related to the customs check mentioned in P (""ahkun jep shara gaw ndang kalang mai byin wa ai"" - customs check can happen once), knowing *if* your items are allowed *before* you travel allows you to avoid problems, or make alternative arrangements.

**Therefore, both A and D are good answers.** However, option A focuses more on the direct questions mentioned in passage P and is the better answer.

The best answer is **A: Lama dai hta mying jahpan jep ai lam nga yang (If there are registration checks there)**.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Cochamó Hkaraw lapran bumlung ai ni hpe lam nnan tam mu na matu hpa gaw ahkang jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: ningmu ginra ni**.

Here's why:

* **The passage mentions that climbers are constantly marking new routes *between remaining untouched walls*. These ""untouched walls"" are essentially the climbing opportunities and challenges, which are related to geographical or geological features of an area and the terrain. Therefore, the viewpoint of each of these geographical or geological features would be a great place to start or find a new route.**

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: bum pungding ni** - While the passage mentions summits, it focuses more on the unexplored routes *between* the walls.
*   **C: bum nchyun ni** - bum nchyun ni are mentioned, the main focus is on the untouched rock walls offering new route possibilities.
*   **D: Shakum ni** - Shakum are just mentioned as a fact about the place.

Therefore, **A** best reflects the passage's emphasis on unexplored rock faces offering climbing opportunities."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Southern Hemisphere hta kadai gaw law malawng lai ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance**.

The text explicitly states that ""Star Alliance gaw Santiago de Chile to Tahiti ngu ai LATAM mungkan nbungli kaw na Dingda Pacific a sinpraw maga hta lai nna shara shagu de shara la da ai"". This indicates that Star Alliance has a presence and coverage in the Southern Hemisphere, specifically across the South Pacific. The passage also mentions that no other group (including SkyTeam) does.
"
"Southern Hemisphere hta, gara pyenli alliance gaw panglai lai hti hkum shadang yawm dik rai?","Based on the provided text, the answer is **A: Star Alliance**.

The passage states that Star Alliance, specifically via LATAM's Santiago de Chile to Tahiti route, is the only alliance that crosses the South Pacific in the eastern region. This implies that other alliances (including SkyTeam as explicitly mentioned) do not have comparable routes, leading to fewer crossings.
"
Gara bu hkawm hpung gaw Mungkan Lagat Shingjawng hpung hpe matut hkap la sai rai?,"The answer is **B: Sa Lagat Shingjawng lamang hpung**.

The passage states: ""Mungkan Lagat Shingjawng hpung a ninghkring wa, sa lagat uhpung ni gaw dan mali hta na gat shingjawng lawm masha law law hte zinghkri nga ai."" This translates to: ""The founder of the World Dodgeball Federation, **Sa dodgeball organizations**, are active with many dodgeball participants from various countries."" This clearly indicates Sa dodgeball organizations are affiliated with the World Dodgeball Federation.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Sa Lagat Shingjawng lamang hpung hku sightrunning hpung kade hpe matut mahkai na matu karum sai rai?","The passage states: ""Mungkan ga hku na gaw, mungkan hta lagat shingjawng uhpung uhpawng 200 daram nga ai."" and then later ""Mungkan Lagat Shingjawng hpung a ninghkring wa, sa lagat uhpung ni gaw dan mali hta na gat shingjawng lawm masha law law hte zinghkri nga ai.""

The question asks how many ""sightrunning"" organizations the World Sightrunning Association helps connect, and the passage indicates it's connected to running participants from **mali** countries. Since the question is about *organizations* and not countries, we need to infer. However, the text connects ""mali"" to *participants*. Since we're looking for a number of *organizations* and ""mali"" is the only option related to participants. And more to the point, the paragraph continues by discussing *events* not organizations helped, the connection of countries to participants means that the answer must be linked to the number of countries.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: mali**.
"
Mungkan bu hkawm ai hku na lapaw te hpe asan sha yu na matu hpa galaw ra na rai?,"The text mentions that animals like leopards can be seen better using binoculars. Therefore, the correct answer is **C: myi htawn hpe jai lang na**.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, mawdaw hte bu hkawm ai shaloi gara dusat hpan hte mahkoi hkrum kadup na rai?","The passage states: ""Dai zawn magoi hte lagaw galau dusat ni hpe mawdaw hte a ni sha sa yu ai..."". This translates to ""Such as monkeys and quadruped animals can only be seen by car...""

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Lagaw galau dusat ni**.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpa gaw bu hkawm sa hkrun lam a manu hpe shayawm ya na rai?","The passage states that travelling in larger groups is more cost-effective (""Bu hkawm ai magam gaw masha uhpung kaba ni a matu gaw grau manu hpa ai re""). It specifically recommends forming a group of four to six people to split costs (""masha langai hkrai a manu gau hkyemsa na matu mali kaw na kru du hkra re ai masha uhpung hkrang pru wa hkra laga masha ni hte hkrum tsup na matu shakut u"").

Therefore, the answer is **B: masha mali uhpung hpe tam na** (find a group of four people).
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, kaja dik ai bu hkawm sa hkrun lam manu hpe kadai lu la mayu na rai?","The passage states that a group of four to six people is ideal to maximize the value of a guided tour.

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states:** ""masha langai hkrai a manu gau hkyemsa na matu mali kaw na kru du hkra re ai masha uhpung hkrang pru wa hkra laga masha ni hte hkrum tsup na matu shakut u"" which translates to ""try to meet other people in order to form a group of four to six people in order to gauge the value of each person"".

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **D: masha marai manga uhpung** (a group of five people)"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, San Francisco na mungkan matsing masat ai lam hpe kadai gaw karum ningtum ai rai?","The passage says: ""Dai mahkawn, sumla hkrung, laili laika ngut nna myit kaba ai ladat ni a hkrang ni gaw myu ni hpe madi shadaw ai re ngut nna mungkan hta dai ni a majaw mying kaba ai."" This translates to: ""The creations of music, films, literature and innovative thought support the nation and are known around the world for this.""

While the passage mentions high-standard meeting centers and diverse Asian cuisine, the primary reason stated for San Francisco's global recognition is its contributions to art, literature, and innovation, which ""support the nation."" This aligns best with option C, ""amuyu hkum ai sut masa hpaji lam"".

Therefore, the best answer is **C: amuyu hkum ai sut masa hpaji lam** (diverse art/cultural contributions). It is the closest to how the passage describes San Francisco's global reputation and aligns with its support for the ""nation."""
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw San Francisco hte seng nna n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: sumla hkrung hte laika buk ni hta jahkring hkring lawm ai**

Here's why:

*   **A: sumla hkrung hte laika buk ni hta jahkring hkring lawm ai** (Appearing frequently in movies and books) - While the passage mentions ""mahkawn, sumla hkrung, laili laika ngut nna myit kaba ai ladat ni a hkrang ni gaw myu ni hpe madi shadaw ai re ngut nna mungkan hta dai ni a majaw mying kaba ai,"" which could be interpreted as movies and books contributing to San Francisco's fame, it doesn't directly state that San Francisco ""frequently appears"" in them. The emphasis is on the city supporting creative expressions that contribute to its global reputation.

*   **B: Asha lusha gaw chyam bra nga ai** (Asian food is widespread) - The passage states: ""San Francisco gaw mungdan kaw nga ai Asha dan: Korea, Thai, Kala hte Japan masha ni a lusha mai lu ai hkrak dik htum ai shara ni kaw na langai rai nga ai"" which translates to ""San Francisco is one of the best places in the country to find food from Asian countries: Korea, Thailand, India and Japan.""

*   **C: manam dap hte zuphpawng ginra shara law law nga ai** (Has many hotels and conference venues) - The passage states: ""San Francisco gaw mungkan buhkawm ai lam hte seng nna ningpawt ninghpang ra madung re nga ai manam jarawp kaba law law, lu sha seng kaba ni hte tsaw dik madang zuphpawng ginra nta kaba ni hpe gaw sharawt la ngut sai re"" which translates to ""San Francisco has developed many hotels, excellent restaurants, and high-quality conference venues that are essential for world tourism.""

*   **D: sut masa hpaji lam gaw mungkan bu hkawm bungli magam ntsa yawng nawng shamyet nga ai** (The economy depends heavily on world tourism) - The passage states that San Francisco is a popular destination for tourists (""San Francisco na bungli gaw mungkan kaw na sa chyai ai masha ni hte seng taw ai shaloi, dai hpe garan wa ai""). This means the economy depends on world tourism.

Therefore, option A is the only statement not directly supported by the provided text."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, bu hkawm kasa magam gun ya ai hpe jai lang ai kaw nna gara bu hkawm masha gaw mahkoi ahkyu n lu na rai?","The correct answer is **B: madu myit hte sha galaw chye ai bu hkawm masha** (a self-sufficient traveler).

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes that travel agents are beneficial because they:
    *   Help travelers find accommodations.
    *   Have connections to specialized services.
    *   Can arrange pre-packaged tours including transportation, meals and lodging.
    *   Can help obtain needed travel documents.

*   A self-sufficient traveler is someone who prefers to handle all these arrangements themselves. They wouldn't need or want the assistance of a travel agent. All the other options are something that the agent can help with or a prepackaged travel arrangement which agents arrange. Therefore, this traveler would get little benefit."

Here's why:

*   **B: manam dap hte seng ai myit hkrum ai lam** - The passage mentions that travel agents have connections with hotel chains (manam jarawp ni), implying agreements are in place.
*   **C: yawng lawm ai gumhpawn masat tawn ai hkrun lam lajang da ai lam ni** - The passage explicitly states that travel agents arrange all-inclusive packages with meals, transportation, and hotels.
*   **D: alak mi lajang da ai lam galaw da ai** - The passage mentions that travel agents can arrange special accommodations and help you customize your trip.
*   **A: lawan ladan re bu hkawm ai hte seng ai laika ni** - the prompt does not mention any information about how quickly travel documents are received when using a travel agent."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, real-time ga gale ai application ni n lu galaw ai gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **D: tsalam shadang hta tsa 100% aten tup hkrak jaw hkra gale ya ai** (translate to always translate at 100% accuracy).

The passage explicitly states that while real-time translation apps are getting better, they are not yet 100% accurate. It mentions occasional inaccuracies and the need for some level of wariness. The other options are things the apps *can* do, according to the passage.
"

This translates to: ""One of the most prominent apps in this category is Google Translate, which allows you to translate without the internet after downloading the required language packs from the internet.""

Therefore, the answer is **C: ga hte seng ai shiga ni hpe kaga de htawt la da ai** (downloading language packs).
"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw hkyen hte nlung tawng sharut ai lam a npawt nhpang n re ai rai?,"The passage describes conditions on a mountain with an ice cave. It mentions:

*   **Heavy snowfall:** ""Numri grai hkrat ai lam rai nga ai"" - A lot of snow falls.
*   **Trails being made:** ""hkawm sa na matu lam ni hpe galaw la ra nga ai"" - Trails need to be made for travel.
*   **Frequent snowfall:** ""kalang marang nuri hkrat ai lam ni gaw lam byin taw chye ai"" - Frequent snowfall can block trails.
*   **Measures taken:** Some measures involve exposing ice to the sun, others cause more snowfall, and sometimes people make trails.

The question asks which of the provided options is *not* a contributing factor to the formation of an ice cave:

*   **A: numri htat ai (Snow melting):** Snow melting is a crucial factor in the creation of ice caves. Meltwater carves out the cave system.
*   **B: shinggyim masha (Humans):** The passage mentions humans building trails, but this is not a natural event of how ice cave is formed
*   **C: jan shingkang (Sunlight):** The passage mentions sunlight being used to melt ice, suggesting it can influence cave formation/size.
*   **D: bungjat numri hkrat ai lam (Increased snowfall):** While heavy snowfall blocks trails, it also contributes to the overall ice/snow mass, which is then subject to melting and cave formation.

Therefore, the best answer is **B: shinggyim masha (Humans)**.

The passage mentions humans creating trails, but their actions are not the direct, primary cause of ice cave formation compared to the other natural factors. While their presence might slightly influence the melting process (e.g., by packing down snow), their impact is less significant than the natural elements.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw hkyen hte nlung tawng sharut ai hku nna byin ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: dingchyung bum nhkren ntsa na law htam ai numri** (more snow on mountain tops).

Here's why:

*   The passage explains that heavy snowfall on mountain tops can cause avalanches. Therefore, excessive snow is directly related to rock and snow slides. The other options aren't a direct result of the snow or ice causing a slide."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, shat mai gaw gara gayau bang ai rai hta npawt da ai rai?","Based on the provided text (P), the correct answer is:

**B: tsi pawt ni hte namji nam-ya ni**

The text states: ""Shat mai ngu ai gaw namlaw namlap hte nanam pyaw hpa tsi ru ni hte shan namlaw namlap ni yawng hpe madung da shat mai hka wan re."" This translates to ""Shat mai is a kind of food based on all the herbs and fragrant roots, and fragrant leaves.""
"
"Nkau shara ni hta, ma-un chyu hpe shat mai hta kalang marang gara gayau ai rai a malai jai lang ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: chyu chyana**.

Here's why:

* **P** states that some regions use ma-un chyu as a primary ingredient in shat mai.
* **Q** asks what is *sometimes* used in place of ma-un chyu in shat mai.
* **P** also mentions that in some areas, nga chyu chyahkri is the main ingredient.
* Therefore, **chyu chyana** (which refers to nga chyu chyahkri, the fish sauce) is used in place of ma-un chyu in some locations.
"
Transantarctic Bum makau maja magaw gaw kawngtsaw bumpa de du na matu ra ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: laksan galaw shapraw da ai mawdaw jak ni gaw lawan ladan n re ai**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ndai ni gaw nau n lawan ai majaw hkrun lam gaw kawng tsaw bumpa de du na matu Transantarctic bum ni makau kaw grai galu hkra magaw kau ra ai.""
* **Translation:** ""These [specially designed vehicles] are not very fast, so the journey has to be detoured a long way near the Transantarctic mountains to reach the polar plateau.""

This clearly implies that the reason for detouring near the Transantarctic Mountains is because the specially designed vehicles are slow.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: McMurdo Dap gaw jahkring hkring pat ai** (McMurdo Station is constantly closed): The passage doesn't mention anything about McMurdo Station being closed.
* **B: adak bang da ai numri gaw hkrit tsang ra ai** (Ice shelves are dangerous): While ice shelves can be dangerous, the passage focuses on vehicle speed as the reason for the detour.
* **D: Ross Painglai hku na bu hkawm ai hta grau loi ai** (Easier to travel through Ross Sea): The passage doesn't mention that it is easier to travel through Ross Sea.

"Dingda Pole Traverse ding yang, hpa hpe dawnghkawn hte masat da ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: hkyen hte hpring taw ai hkyen ugang ga hkang (hkyen ni hte hkyen hka lwi hkang ni hte chyu hpring chyat nga)**.

The passage states that the area is ""hpring chyat nga nna dawnghkawn hte masat tawn da ai"" (filled and marked with flags) and that it is ""hkyen ni hte hkyen hka lwi hkang ni hte chyu hpring chyat nga"" (only filled with snow and ice crevasses). Therefore, the flags mark the snow and ice crevasses.
"
Dingda Afrika de sa du masam maram ai shaloi maigan bu hkawn ai ni hku nna sadi da ra ai lama mi hpe lawu na laika kaw n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Dingda Africa na htingbu mungdan ni yawng ngu na ram gaw simsa ai** (Not all neighboring countries of South Africa are safe).

Here's why:

*   **The passage specifically states:** ""Dingdung Africa gaw kaja tim laga makau mungdan ni gaw nkaja shaloi myit hta sha bang da u."" (South Africa is good, but the surrounding countries are not always good, keep that in mind.) This directly contradicts option C, which claims all neighboring countries are safe.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best answer:

*   **A: mungdan n bung hkat ai hta mungdan shang lakmat hte seng ai ra rawng lam n bung ai** (Different countries have different requirements for entry permits): This is mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: mawdaw hte bu hkawm ai gaw beaten path shara ni de sa du na matu kaja ai lam re** (Traveling by car is a good way to reach places off the beaten path): This is implied in the passage as it discusses the advantages of having a car for traveling in the area.
*   **D: mawdaw hte bu hkawm yang 4x4 hpe madi shadaw da ai** (4x4 is recommended when traveling by car): This is mentioned in the passage.

Therefore, option C is the statement that is NOT supported by the passage."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Dingda Africa hpe mawdaw hte bu hkawm mayu ai masha ni a matu nkaja ai hpaji jaw ai lam hku na sawn lu na rai?","The correct answer is **D: Dingda Africa na htingbu mungdan ni yawng gaw sa du bu hkawm na matu kaja htum n re**

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states: ""Dingdung Africa gaw kaja tim laga makau mungdan ni gaw nkaja shaloi myit hta sha bang da u."" This translates to ""While Southern Africa is good, keep in mind that neighboring countries are not always good."" This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tara upadai hku nna in-car ahkyak ahkya rai nkau hpe ra na re** (Legal requirements for some in-car essentials will be needed): This is mentioned in the text, ""Mungdan shagu gaw mawdaw kata kaw ra wa mai ai ahkyak ahkya arung arai ni hpe bang tawn da na matu laklai ai tara upadi ni nga ai re"" (Each country has special laws about putting in the car important essentials that will be needed), but it's not the central point related to the quality of the neighboring countries of South Africa for travel.
*   **B: 4x4 hpe madi shadaw da tim, shara law law hpe ayan mawdaw hte sa du mai ai** (Even though 4x4 is supported, many places can be reached by ordinary car): The passage supports 4x4 but doesn't say a regular car can reach a lot of places.
*   **C: mawdaw hte bu hkawm ai gaw ayan lam ni kaw na n re sha kaga lam hku sa mayu ai ni a matu kaja ai** (Traveling by car is good for those who want to go on different routes, not just the usual routes): This is a possible interpretation of the passage but is not a main point.
* The passage suggests that traveling through South Africa by car can be an excellent way to experience the region's natural beauty and visit the locations.

"
Tinang na rai ni hpe n'gawn nsawn di ngam da ai a majaw byin wa mai ai hkrit tsang na lam ngu lawu na gara hpe laika hta n tsun da rai?,"The passage discusses the dangers of leaving your belongings unattended. Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: rai ni lagu la hkrum mai ai (Possessions may be stolen)** - This is directly mentioned in the passage: ""Madu nnga ai nhpye ni gaw lagut ni a masat rai nga ai"" (Unattended items are a target for thieves).

*   **B: tinang gaw nanghpam gun hpai ai wa hku byin wa chye ai (You may become someone who carries drugs)** - This is also explicitly stated: ""Nang pi n chye dat ai sha nang hpe nanghpam tsi shabra ai wa hku jamjau jamhkau byin hkra jai lang katut ai lam ni byin chye ai"" (Without your knowledge, you may become involved in drug trafficking).

*   **C: kaga masha na rai hte shut mat chye ai (You may get confused with someone else's belongings)** - The passage **doesn't** explicitly mention confusion of items. It focuses on theft and drug issues.

*   **D: byin wa na bawm jahkrit shama ai lam hku nna daru magam ni mai mu chye ai (Authorities may perceive potential bomb threats)** - This is mentioned at the end, ""Dai hta sha n-ga seng ang ai magam ni hpe bawm hte jahkrit shama na hpe hkrit tsang ai lam byin pru na matu myit gang ya nga ai"" (Furthermore, it makes authorities worry about potential bomb threats).

Therefore, the answer is **C: kaga masha na rai hte shut mat chye ai** because the passage doesn't mention the possibility of getting belongings mixed up with someone else's."
Namhpam gun hpai ai lam hte seng nna hpa hpe laika hta n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: tinang gaw nanghpam ngun ai raitim, mungdan daru magam ni hku nna tinang a rai ni hpe zing la mai ai**.

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses the risks of unknowingly carrying drugs, the illegality of drug possession, and the potential for severe penalties. It also mentions that unattended luggage is a sign for thieves and can cause fear of bomb threats.
*   Option A is mentioned when it states, ""Nkau mungdan hkan gaw alat shingshawng hku nna ninghkap gasat ai raitimung ari kaba jaw ma ai, dai mara kaw 10 ning hta jan nna htawng jahkrat ai lam (sh) si ari ni du hkra lawm nga ai.""
*   Option B is mentioned when it states, ""Kaga ni a rai hpai karum yang, grau nna gaw mungkan ga daga hte seng ai lamu ga jarik ni hpe lai ai shaloi tinang a rai ni hpe tinang myi npu na galoi hkum shamat kau u.""
*   Option C is mentioned when it states, ""Namhpan chye manam ai gwi hpe shana ai lam nnga ai gara ten kaw tim mai lang ai zawn ndai gaw kata ta taw ai kaw lawm ai.""
*   Option D is not directly mentioned in the passage. While the passage implies that authorities can take action if you are found with drugs, it does not explicitly state that they can seize your possessions even if you are unaware that you are carrying drugs.

"
Lawu kaw na gara luhpa gaw nta makau hkan ban sa ai laman nta hta galaw yu mai ai ngu n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: beer chyaru**.

Here's why:

*   **Kahpi (Coffee):** The passage mentions enjoying affordable coffee in the morning.
*   **Hpalap (Tea):** The passage mentions drinking chamomile tea in the afternoon and having time to experiment with tea blends.
*   **Namsi ntsin (Lemonade):** The passage suggests making lemonade if you want something more exciting.
*   **Beer chyaru (Beer):** The passage talks about trying to find simple ingredients for snacks and if your area had a brewery, it may be close by to you. It does not mention that you can make beer while you are relaxing at home."
tinang a buga mare gaw tsa lu ai htunghking hte mying gumhkawng ai rai yang nta makau hkan ban sa ai laman gara de sa du mai ai rai?,"Based on the prompt, the person is looking for places to visit on their walks where they can enjoy tea, given that their town is known for its tea culture.

*   **A: tinang na htingbu shinggan na kahpi seng ni** (Coffee shops near your neighborhood): While the person mentions coffee at the beginning, the question specifically asks about tea culture.

*   **B: namsi ntsin (sh) namsi hte chyu chyana ni kayau ai ntsin seng ni** (Juice or kombucha shops): This is about juice, not tea.

*   **C: tinang nau nsa ga ai tsa seng ni** (Tea shops that are not too far away): This directly addresses the question about tea shops in a town known for tea.

*   **D: chamomile hpalap shadu ai lusha seng ni** (Restaurants serving chamomile tea): While the person mentions enjoying chamomile tea, the question is about the general tea culture of the town, not just chamomile tea.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is **C: tinang nau nsa ga ai tsa seng ni** (Tea shops that are not too far away).
"
Uhkru jangnai ni gara shara kaw nga rai?,"The correct answer is **B: nawku jawng wang kaw**.

The passage states: ""Nawku jawng wang kaw, nkau lupwa ntsa kaw myit shang sha na zawn re ai lunghpraw hte jang-nai tawn ai uhkru sumla ni nga ai."" This translates to ""In the churchyard, there are crucifixion images sculpted with stones that look reflective, on some tombstones."" This clearly indicates that the crucifixion images are located in the churchyard.
"
gara mungdan shang lakmat hpan gaw marai langai ngai hku nna gumhpraw n-gun law law nga ai lam sakse ra na rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Jawng ma visa**.

The passage specifically states: ""Jawng ma visa ni gaw laga hpaga dai nrai sa chyai ai visa galaw ai lam ngut nna ra ai madi shadaw laika ni nbung ma ai. Mungdan law malawng kaw gaw, nang gaw nang hka ja na matu yaw shada ai hpung kaba kaw na shaga laika hpe lu ra na re nna shau htum alat ningshawng shaning hpe madi shadaw na ja gumhpraw sakse mung ra na re.""

This translates to: ""Student visas have different requirements and supporting documents than business or tourist visas. In most countries, you will need a letter of acceptance from the educational institution you plan to attend and proof of sufficient funds to cover at least the first year of study.""

Therefore, a **Jawng ma visa** (Student visa) requires proof of sufficient funds.
"
Kadai gaw jat la da ai mungdan shang lakmat ra na byin mai dik rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Maigan jawng ma langai** (Foreign student).

The passage explicitly states that while short-term travel for tourism or business may not require a visa in some countries, studying abroad generally requires a visa due to the longer duration of stay. The passage then details the specific requirements for student visas, further reinforcing that foreign students are the most likely to need a visa.
"
Galoi hta jigrawng hpe atsawm sadi ra na rai?,"The best answer is **C: marang maling hta** (in the rainforest).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly discusses the need to be careful of ticks when walking in the rainforest *during the autumn months*. Therefore, simply ""autumn months"" is not a complete answer. The focus is on *where* you are, which is the rainforest.

*   The passage mentions ticks entering cars in the rainforest, so while driving *can* be a factor, it's specifically in the context of the rainforest.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, marang maling hta mawdaw gau shaloi jigrawng ni hpe koi na matu hpa galaw ai kaw na shayawm ra na rai?","The correct answer is **A: mawdaw chying hka ni hpe grai na hkra hpaw da ai lam.**

The passage states that even opening the car door for a few seconds in a rainforest is enough for leeches to get inside. Therefore, minimizing the amount of time the car doors are open helps prevent leeches from entering. The other options aren't directly related to minimizing leeches entering the car.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw Sundarban ni hte seng nna n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: dai na shara ka'ang hkup gaw hka hpung-ya ni re** (that area is entirely mangrove swamps).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""shi a htam masum na htam mi gaw hka shing nrai, hka hpung-ya ni chyu rai nga ai"" (one-third of it is water or swamps). So not the entire area is swamps.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: dai gaw naw ngam nga ai kaba dik ai maling nkau mi lawm ai** (that it contains some of the largest remaining forests) - The passage says, ""Sundarban ni gaw panglai makau kaw na kaba dai hpun ni re"" (Sundarban are the largest mangrove forests).
*   **C: dai gaw mungkan kaba dik panglai makau kaw na hpun ni re** (that it is the largest mangrove forest in the world) - The passage directly states this.
*   **D: Dai gaw Bengal sharaw ni hta apang kap ai zau nyi law law ni a nta buga re** (That it is home to a large number of tigers dependent on Bengal) - The passage mentions ""Royal Bengal sharaw 400"" (400 Royal Bengal tigers)

"
nam maling a gara daw gaw Kala mung lamu ga lapran nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Gangetic pa layang**.

The passage states: ""Dai nam gaw hka makau kaw tu ai hpun ni sha nre - shanhte kaw Gangeti plain ngu hpun ni hte hpring taw ai nam ni ma naw nga taw ai re."" This translates to: ""These forests are not just mangrove forests - they also include forests filled with Gangetic plain vegetation.""

Therefore, the Gangetic plain is the part of the forest located inland."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Inglik ga hpe yawm dik chye na ai lam hpe kadai gaw mahkoi lu mayu na rai?","Based on the passage, young people are more likely to understand English well. Therefore, the people who are least likely to understand English would be older individuals. So, the best answer is:

**D: asak kaba ai ni**
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpa hpe nsen lu shapraw na matu yak na rai?","The answer is **A: n bung ai nsen hte re ai gasi ni**

The passage states: ""Grau nna gaw ndai gaw grai jaw ai ga re, chye na hkra nsen shapraw na yak nga ai.""

Which translates to: ""Generally, this is a very accurate statement, it is difficult to pronounce and understand the different forms of sound.""

This indicates that the difficulty lies in the different forms of sound, so option A is correct.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, ginwang kata hkawm ai mawdaw dap kaw na bus mawdaw jawn na matu masing nga ai bu hkawm ai wa na matu gara masing gaw kaja dik rai na rai?","The correct answer is **D: bu hkawm ai wa gaw sinpraw maga de matut sa na hte hking 6:20 shawng de dap dabang kaw du ai rai yang**.

Here's why:

*   **P: Law malawng shawa jawn mawdaw kaba ni gaw shani tup ginwang kata hkawm shawa jawn mawdaw daru (hka hpe lai di ai) kaw na pru taw ai rai timung, grau nna gaw, sinpraw maga hte Jakar Bumthang de sa ai mawdaw ni gaw 06:30 hte 7:30 aten lapran kaw pru ai re.**

This part of the passage states that buses going eastward depart between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM. Therefore, arriving at the station before 6:20 AM to go eastward is the most suitable plan. The other options are incorrect.

*   **Option A:** It only mentions going to Jarkar and pre-purchasing the ticket. This option does not provide other detailed information or the time schedule.

*   **Option B:** This option states Bumthang and 7 am, but does not say anything else.

*   **Option C:** The paragraph says that buses to Paro have passengers share the car with a lower price. Therefore, it is not a passenger bus. Also, the time schedule is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is D."
Ginwang kata hkawm ai mawdaw dap kaw na sinpraw maga de bu hkawm na matu masing nga ai bu hkawm ai wa matu hpa gaw kaja ai ga machyan rai na rai?,"Let's analyze the passage and the question.

The question asks what is good advice for a traveler planning to travel *east* from the main bus station.

*   The passage states that vehicles going East and to Jakar Bumthang depart mainly between 6:30 and 7:30. This information contradicts option A (""8:30 hpang sha mawdaw ni pru ai"").

*   The passage doesn't mention anything about the level of the tickets, so option B is not correct.

*   The passage says most buses going East leave between 6:30 and 7:30. This implies fewer buses leave later in the day. The number of buses leaving throughout the day is not relevant, so option C is incorrect.

*   The passage states that sharing a cab with other passengers to places like Paro and Punakha (both are *not* on the way to the East) is a faster and more comfortable way to travel. This suggestion does not answer the question, as it is about traveling east.

Although none of the choices are exactly correct, we can still pick the best one, so let us analyze our text.

The first line says, ""Law malawng shawa jawn mawdaw kaba ni gaw shani tup ginwang kata hkawm shawa jawn mawdaw daru (hka hpe lai di ai) kaw na pru taw ai rai timung, grau nna gaw, sinpraw maga hte Jakar Bumthang de sa ai mawdaw ni gaw 06:30 hte 7:30 aten lapran kaw pru ai re."" That translates to, ""Most public buses depart from the main bus station throughout the day, but the buses going East and to Jakar Bumthang depart mainly between 6:30 and 7:30.""

From that we can infer that buses run all day, option (C) shani tup mawdaw law law pru ai. This might be the best response.

**Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: shani tup mawdaw law law pru ai.**

"
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, Timbuktu na tup hkrak gawn dan ai lam n re ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Nbungli hte n mai du lu ai lam (It is not accessible by airplane)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""...dai hta nbungli pa nga ai re"" which means ""it has an airport."" This directly contradicts option C.
*   The passage states, ""Timbuktu gaw matsan mat ai mare kaba re mat sai"" which means, ""Timbuktu is a poor city."" This supports option B.
*   The passage states, ""Dai ni gaw, Timkuktu gaw matsan mat ai mare kaba re mat sai, raitim de a mying gumhkawng ai lam gaw bu hkawm masha ni hpe myit agang shangun ai"" which means, ""Nowadays, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its fame attracts tourists."" This supports option D.
*   The passage states, ""hpamajaw nga yang African masha hta Arbic masha grau law ai majaw re"" which means, ""because there are more Arabic people than African people"". This supports option A.

Therefore, option C is the only statement that is NOT an accurate description of Timbuktu based on the provided text."
Lawu kaw na gara teng man ai lam gaw Timbuktu hte seng nna jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: mare gaw pyenli hte mai lu du ai** (the city is accessible by airplane).

The passage states ""...dai hta nbungli pa nga ai re"" which translates to ""it has an airport"". The other options are incorrect based on the text provided.
"
Madung hta ginhtawng Olympic hpe galoi lamang galaw masat da ai rai? ,"Let's analyze the provided text to determine the original planned date for the Olympics.

The text states: ""Gaw Ningja gumsup lamang hpe shata man matsat 24 kaw na shata man chyhku 5 du hkra hkyen lajang mat na re.""  This translates to something like: ""The opening ceremony was originally planned from July 24th to August 5th.""

The text also mentions that the event was postponed to 2021 due to coronavirus. The sentence, ""shata matsum hta coronavirus htee seng nna shaning 2020 shata tsanit du hkra njaw sai"" implies that the Games were originally scheduled for sometime in 2020.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the original date must have been in the month of **shata man matsat**, which translates to **July**.

From the options given:
A: 2021 shata man matsat (July) - Incorrect, as this is the postponed date, not the original.
B: 2020 shata man masum (March) - Incorrect, the passage implies the original date was July
C: 2021 shata man jahku (September) - Incorrect, as this is outside the originally planned July/August
D: 2020 shata man sanit (April) - Incorrect, the passage implies the original date was July

However, none of the given options precisely match the July date mentioned in the text. The closest and most reasonable answer, given the information and options provided, is July 2020.
Considering the imperfect translation and the options given, the best answer is the one referring to 2020 and July:

While not a perfect match, the implied original date being in July 2020 would make **D: 2020 shata man sanit** the closest answer. So the most appropriate answer given available information, is **D**.

FINAL ANSWER: D

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara masat hta hti gaw bunghpoi laru byin wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: ga hpe hkra ngut ai hpang**.

The passage states: ""Shanhte gaw nbung laru kaw na summwi ni hti zawn yu wa ai hku hpang wa nna shanhte ni ga de hkra ai hte gaw bunghpoi laru byin wa ai re.""  This translates to: ""They begin as drops from the cloud of a tornado and become a tornado once they hit the ground.""
"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw bunghpoi laru a tup hkrak kumla n re ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: dai gaw ga hpe hkra ngut ai hpang funnel laru byin wa ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Bunghpoi laru kaw na summwi ni hti zawn yu wa ai hku hpang wa nna shanhte ni ga de hkra ai hte gaw bunghpoi laru byin wa ai re.  (They start as cloud funnels that come down and become tornadoes *when* they touch the ground.)

Therefore, they are ALREADY tornadoes when they hit the ground, not *becoming* tornadoes after.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: dai gaw galoi tim hkying hkum langai hta 100-200 deng ram nbung shapraw ai**  The passage explicitly states: ""Shanhte gaw nbungl grai gawut ai (ayang 100-200 miles/hking)"" (They have very strong winds (averaging 100-200 miles/hour))
* **B: shanhte gaw li ai rai ni law malawng hpe nawt ai** The passage says: ""rai kaba hpe pi hpai mat ai"" (they carry even big things) This implies the are able to carry light thing.
* **D: dai gaw nbung hpe shinggan de shapru ai gayin shadawn re** The passage says: ""nbung na kata de ntsa de na grup yin ma hkra hpe chyup la nna dip n-gun grai nem ai nbung gayin shadawn langai re"" (a rotating column of air with very low pressure that sucks air from the ground up).  This is a description of the swirling air drawing from the surroundings.

Therefore, option C is the *only* statement that contradicts the provided passage.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, bu hkawm wa gaw shanhte a sa mayu ai mare a mung masa lam hte seng nna gara kaw na hpaji la ra na rai?","Based on the passage, the best answer is **D: shanhte a madu asuya kaw na**.

Here's why:

* The passage directly states that governments provide travel advisories to their citizens. The passage highlights that these advisories are specifically tailored for the citizens of that country.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: shanhte sa du na mung a asuya kaw na:** While the host country may have information, the passage emphasizes the importance of *your own* government's advisories, as they are tailored to your specific nationality's experiences and perspectives.
* **B: bu hkawm ai hte seng ai hpaji jaw laika hta tang madun da ai ningmu ni:** The passage is *critical* of generic travel advice. It argues that such advice is often superficial and doesn't take into account the specific challenges faced by people of different nationalities.
* **C: shanhte sa du na mung masha ni kaw na:** While local perspectives are valuable, the passage primarily cautions against relying solely on information that doesn't consider the traveler's nationality and how they might be perceived or treated differently.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the text is **D**.
"
"bu hkawm ai hte seng ai hpaji jaw laika mabyin hta, maigan mung masha hku nna gara hpe mahkrum madup byin na matu n nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: mungdan a mung masa lam hte seng nna hkrum tsup ai shiga**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage argues that travel advisories are often oversimplified and don't provide a complete picture.** They focus on potential risks and differences without fully explaining the nuances of a country's situation.
*   The passage explicitly states that travel advisories are tailored for a specific country's citizens, and therefore, might not offer a comprehensive understanding of the political landscape.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: dawm kau hkrum ai hkra machyi mat ai pahkam** - While health concerns might be mentioned in travel advisories, the main point of the passage is about the oversimplification of political and cultural contexts.
*   **B: mungdan a mung masa lam hte seng nna atang shalang di kau ai ga shagyin ni** - The passage does not talk about intentionally ignoring political issues, but rather, oversimplifying them.
*   **C: hkra machyi mat ai hkam kaja lam hte seng ai pahkam** - Similar to option A, health is a potential element of travel advisories, but not the central point the passage critiques."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara bu hkawm hpan gaw bu hkawm kasa kaw na karum shingtau lam ra na yawm dik rai?","The passage emphasizes the need for travel agents (bu hkawm bungli dat kasa) when dealing with unfamiliar environments, cultures, languages, or financially struggling countries.  Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: bu hkawm ai wa shawng de n du ga ai mare kaw na bungli zung-ya de bu hkawm ai lam** (A business trip to an unfamiliar city) - This *could* benefit from a travel agent, especially if the business traveler is unfamiliar with the city, its customs, or logistics.

*   **B: laksan jai jarik hte bat lahkawng na ai bu hkawm hkrun lam** (Two-week vacation with special requirements) - Special requirements (laksan jai jarik) strongly suggest needing a travel agent's help to coordinate and ensure these needs are met.

*   **C: tsun shaga ga madin malai byin mai ai bu hkawm hkrun lam** (A package tour) - The passage is not directly related to package tours, but package tours typically have language assistance built in (because they provide a guide), therefore, this option is less relevant.

*   **D: bu hkawm ai wa na maigan de shawng sa du ai hkrun lam** (A first-time trip for the traveler to a foreign country) - This **directly aligns** with the passage's focus on travel agents being useful for trips to unfamiliar countries.

The question asks which type of trip requires the *least* assistance from a travel agent. Considering options A, B and D all would likely need more assistance than C, and the passage not giving any relation to package tours directly, option C is not the best option.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: bu hkawm ai wa shawng de n du ga ai mare kaw na bungli zung-ya de bu hkawm ai lam**
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara masing gaw bu hkawm ai wa a matu bu hkawm kasa ni kaw na karum ya ai akyu law dik lu na rai?","The passage suggests that travel agents are most helpful when someone wants to travel to a country with unfamiliar customs, language, or a poorer nation. Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: bu hkawm ni hku nna shanthe a buga de sa du na matu wa sa pyenli lakmat tau hkrau mari shaloi** (Travelers buying plane tickets in advance to visit their home country): This doesn't align with the passage's focus on unfamiliar destinations.
*   **B: bu hkawm ai hku nna shawng nnan laksan tangpyaw hkun lam a matu lakmat tau hkrau mari na myit lawm yang** (Travelers interested in buying tickets in advance for a unique, special trip): This is more focused on the type of trip, not the difficulties of an unknown country.
*   **C: bu hkawm ai hku nna tinang sa du mayu ai buga a ga hpe atsawm chye shaga yang** (Travelers who speak the language of the place they want to visit well): This contradicts the passage's implication that travel agents are useful when you *don't* know the language.
*   **D: bu hkawm ai ni hku nna shanhte sa du mayu ai shara a htunghking shai ai lam hpe hkau chyap ai rai yang** (Travelers who are familiar with the cultural differences of the place they want to visit): Similar to option C, this contradicts the passage that says travel agents are useful when you *aren't* familiar with the cultures.

None of the options are the best answer. However, options C and D are the closest to answering this question because the passage clearly states a traveler will need a travel agent's help in a place with unknown culture and language. The closer answer between C and D would be D because not knowing the cultural differences can be harder to overcome for the traveler than not speaking the language.

**Therefore, there is no perfect answer, but D is the closest to the most logical response.**"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, shara nnan de bu hkawm ai shaloi bu hkawm ai ni hku nna myit htum ai lam hpe koi yen na matu hpa gaw karum lu na rai?","The correct answer is **C: shanhte sa wa ai mungdan shara kaw na tara upadi bung ni hpe madat mara na** (Obeying the local laws of the place they are traveling to).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of being aware of differences between your home environment and the place you're visiting.**  It explicitly mentions laws, customs, food, transportation, and standards as things that might vary. The whole point is to avoid offending locals or having an unpleasant experience.
* **Obeying the local laws is the most direct way to avoid offending locals and having a bad experience.**
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: shanhte sa wa ai mungdan kaw na madang ni hpe sha myit mada da na** (Only expecting standards from the country they came from) - This is the *opposite* of what the passage advises. The passage warns against expecting things to be the same.
    * **B: nhkau chyap ai malu masha ni hpe chyam mayu ai myit** (Wanting to try new kinds of food) - While trying new food is part of travel, the passage is focused on *avoiding* things that could lead to negative experiences, not just enjoying new things.
    * **D: jarawp nga shara hte seng nna tau hkrau sawk sagawn ai lam hpe koi yen na** (Avoiding preliminary research about the place they are going) -  The passage recommends learning about the place you are visiting, not avoiding it.

Therefore, **C** is the answer that best aligns with the advice given in the passage.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara masha hpan gaw mungdan shara mi de bu hkawm ai shaloi myit htum ai lam hkrum mai ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: myit gyip ai masha (inflexible people)**

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""Sat lawat, jahkrat da ai tara ni, malu masha, mawdaw htinglet, nga jarawp, madang, ga hte kaga lam ni gaw tinang nga ai shara hte shai na re.""  This means that customs, laws, food, transportation, living standards, and language will be different.
* **P also states:** ""Dai gaw jauman masha ni nra ai hpe n galaw hkrup na matu (sh) myit npyaw na lam koi gam na matu na myit hta galoi mung matsing da ra ai lam re."" You should always be aware in your mind in order to avoid doing things that locals don't like or that might make you unhappy.

These differences are a challenge for people who are ""myit gyip ai"" (inflexible) meaning people who have rigid expectations and find it hard to adapt to new things. They are more likely to be unhappy when things aren't the way they expect them to be. Therefore the answer is **C**.

This translates to: ""You shouldn't sleep on the ground on a thin mat in unknown areas. If you are camping, carry a small sleeping bag to protect yourself from insects etc.""

Therefore, the passage advises using a sleeping bag when camping.

The correct answer is **C: Camp galaw yang yup ku kaji (sh) singgoi hpe lang na matu hpaji jaw da ai** (Advised to use a sleeping bag when camping).
"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw rawt maja wa ai mungdan hta nga shamawn ai shaloi gumhpraw majoi joi jai ra ai ngu n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: camp na matu si htun (sh) rai magap (camp na matu si htun (sh) rai magap)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses the need to spend money on Western-style comforts, accommodation, food, and services. It also mentions the importance of carrying a sleeping bag or something to protect from the ground if camping.
*   Options A, B, and D are explicitly mentioned as things that require spending money in the text.
*   Option C is mentioned as something to *bring* with you if camping, rather than something you need to *buy* or spend money on *while* traveling. While it's true that you initially spend money when buying your camping gear, the question is specifically asking about spending money while in the developing nation. The passage implies you *should* already *own* your sleeping bag/mat."
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw virtual hkrang tara hpe ra sharawng ai, raitim mungkan kumpyuta hkridun n lu mai ai hkrang tara jum lang ai wa na matu kaja dik htum rai?","The best answer is **C: shanhte a lang hkawm mai ai komputa matsing hta hkrang bung hpe jahting da ai**.

Here's why:

*   **The question asks about offline accessibility:** The prompt specifically asks for the ""best"" option when the person *can't* access the internet.

*   **Option A (bu hkawm manang hpe hkrang bung langai jaw ai):** Relying on someone else is not the most reliable method for having consistent access, especially offline.

*   **Option B (hkrang bung langai hpe tinang de bai email galaw ai):** A copy of the document in email is only available if there is the option to access internet, which is specified in the question to not be possible.

*   **Option C (shanhte a lang hkawm mai ai komputa matsing hta hkrang bung hpe jahting da ai):** This directly addresses the offline requirement by storing the file directly on their device, allowing access without an internet connection.

*   **Option D (""cloud"" kaw hkrang bung langai hpe zing da ai):** Cloud storage requires internet access to retrieve the file, making it useless in the scenario described in the question."

This means foreign phone numbers and the victim's email address *are* needed. The passage does *not* explicitly mention needing the enforcement agent's email address.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: hkrang tara jum lang ai wa na email hkring dat**
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara negative size gaw jai lang ai film format sumla dawng pru dik rai?","The correct answer is **B: 56 by 56 mm negative**.

The passage states that some smaller cameras use the 6 by 6 cm format, which is equivalent to a 56 by 56 mm negative. It also mentions that this format is significantly larger (about four times the size) than a 35 mm negative. Therefore, a 56 by 56 mm negative would provide a finer image detail than a 35 mm negative.
"
Lawu kaw na gara sumla hkrung gayet ai hkrang ni gaw DSLR hte bung ai dan leng ai lam resolution hpe jaw ai rai?,"The passage states that 35 mm film (specifically the 24mm x 36mm format) ""mat ai rai tim aloi sha bai mai chyahpring nga ai rai nna DSLR hte shingdaw nna mahtai lu jaw nga ai."" This translates to something like: ""though it might be inferior, it can easily be used and provides results comparable to DSLR.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: 35 mm sumla hkrung**
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw bu hkawm laika ka hpaga yumga hpang na matu hpang jahtum tsang rai?","The correct answer is **C: tinang a website hpe gaw gap na** (building your own website).

Here's why:

The passage outlines the steps to starting a travel blog business:

1. **Research:** Study successful travel blogs.
2. **Learn Skills:** Understand web formatting and editing (proofreading).
3. **Create Website:**  After learning the basics, *then* you build your own website.

Therefore, building your own website (tinang a website hpe gaw gap na) is the *last* step mentioned in the given instructions.  The other options are earlier steps in the process.

The passage states that the easiest way to start a travel blogging business is to **begin** by sharing your experiences on existing travel blogs. This implies focusing on **writing skills** for online platforms first. The other options are important later, but writing is the foundational skill.
"
gara du hkra ladaw hpan gaw pu hte seng ai ana manghkang law malawng mu ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Kahtet ai du hkra ladaw**.

The passage specifically states: ""Kahtet ai du hkra ladaw hta bacteria ni gaw grau gaba lawan ai ngut nna masha hkum kaw nrai yang grau na hkra hkrung ma ai... kahtet ta hta mung pu hte seng ai ana ni law law byin chye nga ai."" (In hot seasons, bacteria grow faster and thrive better outside of human bodies... in hot weather, there are many stomach-related illnesses.)
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, ayan hkra ai gaw hpa na dang hkam jan ai de woi gindun wa mai ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: buga ginra ana kanu ni**

The passage states that ""Ginra shara hkan na ana ni hpe matut manoi tam shapraw wa ai a majaw, nta hkan nang dang hkam jan ngut sai re nga ana zingli ni hpe n-gun jaw ai lam gaw grau tsaw wa nga ai."" This translates to: ""Because of constantly exposing oneself to local diseases, the encouragement for building immunity after returning home is increasing.""

Therefore, frequent exposure leads to increased immunity against **local diseases (buga ginra ana kanu ni)**.
"
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, Schengen ginwang lapran bu hkawm ai na akyu rai?","The correct answer is **C: maigan pru hkawm lakmat hkang jep ai shara law law hpe koi yen mai ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Dai shara kaw nang naw nga yang, dai passport jep ai shara hpe passport nlam ai sha mai lai na re."" (If you are within that area, you can pass passport control without showing your passport.) This directly implies avoiding passport control checkpoints.
* **Option A:** ""mungdan shang lakmat application law law hpe koi yen mai ai"" is incorrect. A Schengen Visa *is* an application, and this passage discusses avoiding needing *multiple* visas for different countries within Schengen.
* **Option B:** ""Gumhpraw mahkawng mayu yang"" (If you want to save money) is indirectly true, as you save money by not needing multiple visas, but it's not the *primary* benefit described.
* **Option D:** ""maigan pru hkawm lakmat ra rawng ai lam n nga ai"" (There is no need for a passport) is incorrect. You still need a passport to enter the Schengen area initially. You just don't need to show it at every border crossing *within* the Schengen area.
"
Tutankhamun na lupwa kata hta hpa hpe n mu lu mai sai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: sut rai ni**.

The passage states that the ""grai kaba hkik hkam ai lup ni gaw dai kaw nnga sai, raitim dai ni hpe Cairo na Egyptian Madun Htingnu de htawt dat ai."" This means the treasures (sut rai ni) are no longer in the tomb. The passage also mentions you can see the head and limbs of the mummy. While the tomb is described as less elaborately decorated (shatsawm da ai lam nkau), the question asks what you *can't* see, and the passage implies that some decorations are still present.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara Vancouver shara gaw bu hkawm manu-myit tsang taw ai bu hkawm masha ni a matu ra sharawng na lam yawm dik rai? ","The answer is **A: Granville Zunlawng**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Bowen Island is a popular destination.
*   It mentions the importance of coastal trails and hiking to mountain peaks near the ocean, suggesting those are desirable activities.
*   It highlights Whistler's popularity, despite being more expensive, due to the Olympics and its skiing/mountain biking opportunities.
*   Granville Island is only mentioned as a place to catch the ferry to Bowen Island; it doesn't offer any specific attractions for nature lovers or hikers, therefore the option with the lowest appeal."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara shara gaw mai byin na lam tsaw dik rai?","The correct answer is **B: Whistler**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states that Whistler is famous due to the 2010 Winter Olympics and offers good skiing in the winter and mountain biking in the summer. This makes it a high-probability destination based on the text.
*   The passage does mention Bowen Island, Howe Sound, Vancouver, and Granville Island, but it only uses them to describe where the unnamed organization is located and how to get there.
*   There is no indication of any specific activities done in Vancouver, other than being a place to start your journey to Howe Sound and Bowen Island.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, bu hkawm ai ni hku nna dingbai dingna n jaw ai ningmu ni hpe tam taw yang Hka Rum ni de galoi sa du ra na rai?","The text states: ""Yanam ta hta (shata man shi langai kaw na shata man matsum), hka shadang grau jaw wa na ra ai hte Mangai ta hta gaw grau hkamsha pyaw na ra ai."" This implies that during Yanam ta (November to March), the water levels are higher. The passage warns that high water levels might obstruct the view of the falls and the railway is ""soaked"".

Therefore, to avoid difficult conditions, it is best to visit outside of ""Yanam ta,"" making **D: lanam ta shinggan de** the correct answer.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Victoria Hka rum ni de Shata man shi langai hte shata man masum lapran sa du bu hkawm na matu kaja ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: lanam ta hpe koi yen lu ai** (avoiding the rainy season).

The passage explicitly states that during *lanam ta* (November to March), the water level is higher, which can obstruct good views of the falls. Therefore, avoiding that time would be ideal.

The passage states: ""Drone (lamu ntsa pyen hkawm ai jak) ni hpe nang nga taw ai shara kaw tara nshang yang pi, nbungli daru makau hkan shing nrai, shawa hpawng ntsa hkan pyen hkawm ai gaw n galaw ging ai lam re."" This translates to: ""Even if drone laws are not in effect where you are, it's not appropriate to fly near airports or over public gatherings."" This directly contradicts the idea that you should only film in crowded or hard-to-see areas. The passage advises *against* flying in those locations.
The other options are supported by the text:
*   **A**: ""Lama na jak pyen kem ra lang na re yang, nang hpa sumla ni hpe gayet na ahkang nga ai hte hpa ahkang jaw lakmat (sh) kahtap nna hpa ahkang jaw lakmat ni lu ra ngu ai lam hpe shawng atsawm jep maram yu u."" translates to: ""If you need to use an aircraft, carefully check in advance what you are allowed to film and what permits (or further permits) you need.""
*   **B** relates to obtaining permits which are mentioned in the passage.
*   **C** relates to the need to investigate."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, drone (lamu ntsa pyan hkawm ai jak) jai lang nna sumla gayet na matu gara shara gaw kaja dik rai?","The best answer is **D: tinang tau hkrau nna ahkang lu da ai shara ni kaw (in places where you have obtained permission in advance).**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes checking permissions:** The passage explicitly states, ""...lama na jak pyen kem ra lang na re yang, nang hpa sumla ni hpe gayet na ahkang nga ai hte hpa ahkang jaw lakmat (sh) kahtap nna hpa ahkang jaw lakmat ni lu ra ngu ai lam hpe shawng atsawm jep maram yu u."" This translates to ""if you need to use an aircraft [drone], carefully check in advance what pictures you are allowed to take and what permissions (or additional permissions) you need."" Therefore getting permissions ahead of time is vital.
* **The passage prohibits taking images over crowds:** ""Drone (lamu ntsa pyen hkawm ai jak) ni hpe nang nga taw ai shara kaw tara nshang yang pi, nbungli daru makau hkan shing nrai, shawa hpawng ntsa hkan pyen hkawm ai gaw n galaw ging ai lam re"" Translating to, even if there is no law where you are at, it's not good to fly drones over crowds or near the airport.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Drone (lamu ntsa pyan hkawm ai jak) nga ai majaw myit sharu ai lam n nga ai shawa hpung ni makau hta (near crowds where there is no concern about drones)**- This goes against the advice of the text.
* **B: ayan sumla gayet na matu ahkang n lu ai shara ni kaw (in places where it is not permitted to take pictures)** - The text implies that you should get permission before you can gayet. If you can't get permission, then you shouldn't gayet.
* **C: drone (lamu ntsa pyan hkawm ai jak) hpe nau n mu lu ai shamu shamawt masha law ai shara ni kaw (in crowded places where drones are not easily seen)** - While it may be difficult to see the drone, the text specifically advises that you should not fly the drone over crowds.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, mungdan shang lakmat galaw na matu mying chyahpan bang ai hte seng nna gara gaw n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Mungdan yawng gaw tinang nga ai shara kaw na ginra ahkaw ahkang lu hpung ni hte mying chyahpan bang ra ai.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Nkau mungdan hkan gaw..."" (Some countries...), which means not all countries require registration with local authorities. Option B makes the incorrect claim that *all* countries require it.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: Tinang gaw sa chyai ai ni nga ai shara kaw nga na rai yang, mying chyahpan n bang ra na re** - The passage states ""Laga lam hta, sa chyai ai ni nga ai shara a shin gan kaw nga ai ni sha mying chyhpang ra ai"". This supports option A.
*   **C: Masha jahpan hta ai rung ni de sa du ai lam ra rawng wa mai ai** - The passage mentions ""Dai kaw na pya da dai nrai masha jahpan hta ai rung kaw na laika form hpe htai na ra ai"". This supports option C.
*   **D: Shara nkau ni hta, buga ginra na manam jarawp ni galaw ya na re** - The passage states ""Dai tara nga ai mungdan law malawng hta gaw, mying matsing masat ai lam ni hpe buga ginra na manam jarawp ni galaw ya na re"". This supports option D."
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, mungdan bu hkawm masha ni hku nna shanhte a mying jahpan bang ai lam a matu sa du ra ai shara n re ai rai?","The answer is **C: buga laika sa rung** (local post office).

*   The passage mentions the following places as being involved in the registration process:
    *   Local authorities (which could include a local police station)
    *   Immigration offices/departments of state
    *   Census offices
    *   Local groups that assist newcomers
*   It specifically states that the registration might be done through local authorities.
*   It also states that you might need to fill out a form from the census office.
*   It states that community groups may assist with registration.
*   A local post office (buga laika sa rung) is not mentioned."
Kadai gaw bu hkawm ai shaloi dawjau galaw ai kaw na akyu n lu na rai?,"The passage states that volunteering abroad can help you:

*   Meet new people.
*   Learn about yourself.
*   Gain new perspectives.
*   Acquire new skills.
*   Potentially get free room and board, and sometimes even a small stipend.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: manang nnan tam na matu yaw shada da ai marai langai ngai (Someone looking to make new friends):** The passage mentions meeting new people as a benefit, so this person would likely benefit.
*   **B: manu law ai shata shabrai hpe tam taw ai marai langai ngai (Someone looking for a high salary):** The passage specifically says that you might get a small stipend, but it's not a high salary. This person might not benefit.
*   **C: hpaji nnan hkaja na hpe tam taw ai marai langai ngai (Someone looking to learn new skills):** The passage mentions acquiring new skills as a benefit, so this person would likely benefit.
*   **D: gawk hte shat sha shabrai hta myit lawm ai marai langai ngai (Someone interested in free room and board):** The passage mentions free room and board as a possibility, so this person would likely benefit.

Therefore, the answer is **B: manu law ai shata shabrai hpe tam taw ai marai langai ngai (Someone looking for a high salary)**. Volunteering abroad, as described in the passage, is not a good option for someone seeking a high salary.

*   **Q asks:** How does volunteering abroad benefit a budget traveller?
*   **A, B, and C** talk about money, work, and accommodation.
*   **D** is the best answer because it directly relates to the point about gaining new perspectives, which is a significant benefit for travelers on a budget, enhancing their travel experience.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D**."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Walt Disney Mungkan de bu hkawm lam a alak mi re ai ngu gara hpe sawn lu na rai?","The correct answer is **C: bu hkawm hkrun lam yawng hpe Disney wang kaw aten htum ai** (Spending the entire vacation within the Disney World grounds).

The passage describes a typical Disney World trip as:

*   Flying to Orlando
*   Driving to Disney World
*   Spending about a week *there*
*   Returning home

This implies that the whole vacation is centered around and spent *within* Disney World. The other options are either incorrect or not the central defining aspect of the trip described in the passage.
"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Walt Disney Mungkan hte seng nna n jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: mawdaw jahkring lakmat ni hpe kaga bu hkawm masha ni hpe shalai ya mai ai**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Disney *prohibits* the sharing of tickets. While it doesn't specifically mention parking passes, it's reasonable to infer that similar restrictions apply.
*   B: The passage states that people travel from the Orlando airport to a Disney resort and then travel within the resort for about a week. This means that there are site-kata manam dap.
*   C: The passage states that people go to Orlando airport and then drive to Disney resorts. This means that they can take buses from the airport.
*   D: The passage says that ""a lot of tickets are sold each day"" on auction websites."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara manghkang gaw hpaji ninghkrin shaman shakyang tsang (sh) laika shabra ai ni kaw sharin ya na matu n mai byin dik rai?","Based on the passage, the Hostile Environment Course focuses on things relevant to conflict zones, like survival, first aid, and possibly weapons training. It also warns that the local media may be unreliable or biased.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Nam mali hkrit hpa kaw na lawt lu wa ai lam (Escaping jungle dangers):** This might be a survival skill taught in the course, depending on the environment.

*   **B: ningshawng tsi lajang lajin ai lam (First aid):** The passage explicitly mentions ""ningshawng garum ningtum"" (first aid).

*   **C: majan shara a matu alu tsu re ai lam (Being immune to disease for the war zone):** This is likely a medical topic and not part of the skills that would be taught in a Hostile Environment Course.

*   **D: nan shang lawm hkrang shala ai lam (Participating in self-defense):** This could include weapons training, which the passage mentions as a possibility.

Therefore, the least likely topic to be taught in a hostile environment course is **C: majan shara a matu alu tsu re ai lam (Being immune to disease for the war zone)**.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara hpaji gin hpan gaw hpaji ninghkrin shaman shakyang tsang hta sharin ya na matu byin mai dik rai?","The best answer is **B: majan shara** (war zone).

Here's why:

*   The passage focuses on preparing for dangerous environments, specifically mentioning ""majan shara hku masat da ai mungdan"" (countries designated as war zones).
*   The hostile environment course prepares individuals to handle various situations in war zones.
*   The mention of ""laknak wunkat ni ma lawm wa na re"" (weapons handling) further supports that the course covers war-related scenarios.

Therefore, **B** is the most relevant and logical answer."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw mahkoi nsan nseng byin mai ai hka hpe koi yen na matu kaja dik ai lata hpa rai?","The best answer based on the passage is **B: hka ndum mari lu na**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically advises buying ""dazik dawk da ai hka ndum ni"" (sealed water bottles from reputable companies) if you are concerned about safety. This is the most direct recommendation for ensuring water quality.
The best translation is:
P: There are many ways to purify water, some methods are better at removing scary things. Some places only take a minute to purify water, and others take many minutes. Water filters also vary in effectiveness. If you are concerned, buy sealed water bottles from famous brands.
Q: According to the text, what is the best option for avoiding drinking unsafe water?
A: boil water for many minutes
B: buy water bottles
C: boil water for a minute
D: Decide where the water will be for scary things

So the best answer is B"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara gaw kungkyang hka hpung yawt ai ni na matu pyi n mai byin na ram re rai?","The correct answer is **C: hka lam hpe ninghtan nna hpung yawt ai** (swimming against the current).

The passage states that many deaths occur because people try to swim against the current of the water surges, which is too strong and leaves them no escape, resulting in death. Therefore, swimming against the current is something that even experienced swimmers cannot do.
"
tinang gaw hka lam hta chyat mat yang hpa galaw ra na rai?,"Based on the passage provided, the best answer is **A: kaga lam de yaw shada nna hka lam kaw na pru lu na matu shakut u, ngut ai hpang panglai hka kau maga de ayan na zawn hpung yawt wa u**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Hka hpungla kaw na nang le wa ai hte bai nhtang hpung yawt na matu gaw yu maya hta grau yak na gaw nre nga ai. Nang dai de kalang bai n shang na shara de shading na sa u."" This emphasizes the importance of avoiding the rip current (hka hpungla) and moving in a different direction. After exiting the rip current, one needs to swim back to the shore.
*   The passage states ""Law malawng si ai lam gaw hka hpung yawt na nmai byin ai hka leng hpe ninghkap hpung yawt ai majaw aba shara nga nna si ai re."" This means that many people die by swimming against the rip current.

Options B, C, and D are not as aligned with the advice given in the passage and not effective."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, numhkap langchyi na gara shara de sa du ai gaw rung pat bu hkawm ai na akyu rawng ai hkrun lam rai?","The correct answer is **C: Rhine hka Masawn hta**

Here's why:

*   The text states, ""Ga shadawn Loire Hka masawn, Rhine hka masawn hkan na langchyi ni de sa du hkawm ai ai lam."" (For example, visiting the vineyards along the Loire Valley, Rhine Valley).
*   The question asks which of the places will benefit from vacation.
*   Therefore, Rhine hka Masawn (Rhine Valley) is listed as an example and a correct answer."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw dai shara hta bu hkawm ai num ni na matu hpaji jaw shiga n rai na rai?","Based on the provided text, here's the breakdown of why the answer is likely **C: kaprip kashoi re ja lung seng sumraw ai kaw na koi yen u (avoid conspicuous displays of wealth)**.

Here's the reasoning:

*   The text emphasizes:
    *   Being truthful about marital status (even if pressured otherwise).
    *   Being aware of differing cultural understandings of femininity and avoiding conforming to just one.
    *   Standing your ground against male harassment and asserting yourself.

Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: tinang a dinghku masat kumla hpe bawngban ai lam kaw na koi gam u (avoid discussing your marital status)** - This directly contradicts the text's advice to be honest about marital status, even if pressure exists to say otherwise.
*   **B: htunghking n bung ai lam gaw buga masha ni kaw na n-gun lawm lai nsam byin pru wa chye hpe sadi u (be aware that differing cultural understanding can be a source of power from the local people)** - The passage encourages awareness of cultural differences and not conforming to a single, potentially restrictive, view of femininity.
*   **C: kaprip kashoi re ja lung seng sumraw ai kaw na koi yen u (avoid conspicuous displays of wealth)** - While the text mentions valuable beads, it does not suggest avoiding wealth displays. The beads are presented as useful. This option is the *least* supported by the text and therefore the most likely to *not* be helpful advice.
*   **D: ra rawng wa yang maja majan re hpe jai lang u (use self defense if needed)** - the passage encourages standing against male harassment and asserting yourself and being strong on your own path, so this could imply self defense.

Therefore, the best answer is **C: kaprip kashoi re ja lung seng sumraw ai kaw na koi yen u (avoid conspicuous displays of wealth)** because this piece of advice is not implied in the context of the passage."
"Laika hta tsun da ai shara ni hta npawt nna, num bu hkawm ai ni a matu hpa gaw karum shingtau ya ai shiga rai?","Based on the provided text, the best answer is **C: tinang a ningmu ntsa kaw sha tsap ai lam koi yen lu na matu htunghking nbung ai lam hpaji jaw ai hpe chye na u**

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes that women should be aware of differing cultural interpretations of womanhood (""Num ni gaw kaning re ai hpe ginjang ai lam re ngu myit la ai hta nbung ai htunghking ni gaw mahtai jaw ya ai hpe dum nga..."").
*   It also advises against adhering to a single perspective (""...bung ai langai hpe sha hkan myit na matu mung nrai nga ai"").
*   Therefore, understanding diverse cultural perspectives is crucial for navigating their journeys.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A:** While the passage does encourage independence, the primary focus isn't simply about disregarding all rules. It's about understanding and navigating cultural norms, not just rejecting them outright.
*   **B:** The passage mentions ta chyawp (jewelry) but does not suggest wearing a large one to advertise marital status. The focus is on the utility of ta chyawp.
*   **D:** While the passage encourages standing firm against mistreatment by men (""La ni hpe galau jahkrat kau ai lam hta ngang ngang tsap nga...""), this is a general statement and not the most specific piece of advice for female travelers.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara masing gaw dusat dumyen sumla gayet ai wa hku nna laksan pat nhpai lang na matu mahkoi ra na rai?","The correct answer is **A: grai kaji ai dusat ni hpe sumla gayet yang**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Dusat dumyen sumla gayet ai hpaji hta u hpung mi dusat kaji ai hku hpan da ai baw zawn re ni hpe kaga pat nhpai baw hte mai gayet tim, ayan na galu ai baw sin-yu sumla pat nhpai gaw ra nga ai.""

This translates to: ""In wildlife photography skills, for things like creating a flock of small animals, you can photograph with other lenses, but a long telephoto lens is always needed."" This means that when photographing very small animals in a wildlife setting, it is often necessary to use a long telephoto lens as opposed to other lenses.

Let's analyze why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: sumla ni hpe hpaga yamga yaw shada ai lam na matu jai lang ai rai yang** (If the pictures are used for commercial purposes): The passage mentions that parks may have specific rules when photography is being done commercially, but it doesn't necessitate a specific type of lens.
*   **C: sumla gayet hkam ai dusat gaw hkrit gaya taw yang** (If the animal being photographed is shy): While shyness might necessitate a longer lens to maintain distance, the passage doesn't specifically link shyness to the *need* for a special lens in all cases.
*   **D: Dusat dumyen sumla gayet ai hte seng nna nampan sun hta laksan rit kawp tara ni nga yang** (If there are specific regulations in the park about wildlife photography): Again, park regulations are mentioned, but they don't directly dictate the use of a particular type of lens."
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, dusat dumyen sumla gayet ai ni a matu byin wa mai ai mayak ngu laika hta n tsun da ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: ra rawng ai pat nhpai hpan hpe garan ginhka galaw ra yang**.

Here's why:

*   **A: laklai ai dusat hpe tam ai (Finding rare animals):** The passage explicitly states that finding rare animals is difficult (""Laklai nna tsam ai dusat ni hpe mu tam na matu yak la nga ai re"").

*   **B: jahte tam chye ai dusat hte sumla gayet ang wa yang (Dealing with animals that are aggressive):** The passage mentions that animals in the wild can be dangerous (""Nam kaw na dusat dumyeng ni gaw gaya chye ai (sh) jahte tam chye ma ai"").

*   **D: hpyen law ai shara kaw bungli galaw ra yang (Working in a hostile environment):** The passage mentions hostile environments (""Makau grup yin masa ni gaw katsi ai, kahtet ai (sh) kaga hku nga yang hpyen tai chye nga ai"").

*   **C: ra rawng ai pat nhpai hpan hpe garan ginhka galaw ra yang (Having to separate different types of necessary equipment):** While the passage mentions the need for different types of equipment (especially long-lens cameras), it doesn't explicitly discuss the *difficulty* of separating or organizing these items.

Therefore, option C is the only one that is not specifically mentioned as a potential challenge for wildlife photographers in the provided text."
Lawu kaw na gara gaw bum hkyet lam ni hpe dinghkren mawdaw gau ai wa na matu manghkang byin shangun ai lam yawm dik rai?,"Based on the passage, the most problematic issue for driving on snowy/icy mountain roads is:

* **B: arut hkat ai n-gun yawm ai lam (reduced traction)**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that ""Hkyen hte numri lim taw ai lam ni kaw gaw arut n-gun n-nga nna kanoi ni sha nep tawn da lam ntsa kaw zawn gaw nang nmai gawt hkang na re."" This translates to ""On snowy/icy roads, there is no traction, it's like driving on thin soap, you can't control it."" Reduced traction is the central issue.
*   Let's examine the other options:
    *   **A: law htam dik ai mawdaw htinglet ai lam (most frequent car accidents):** While frequent accidents might be a result of driving on difficult terrain, the passage doesn't emphasize it as the root problem itself.

    *   **C: salu salat grai law ai lam (very slippery slopes):** Slippery slopes are similar to low traction. Since reduced traction is mentioned directly in the passage, the answer is **B**.

    *   **D: ningmu atsam yawm ai lam (low visibility):** The passage mentions visibility issues due to snow and ice, but it highlights traction as the more fundamental control problem.
"
Mungdan law law hta shang ahkum hkanse hte seng nna hpa gaw ding yang re mahkoi ngam na rai?,"The correct answer is **C: tinang gara kaw jawbang ai** (where you pay).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that income tax systems and rates vary significantly from country to country. Even within countries like the US and Canada, different regions (states/provinces) can have their own income tax rates and rules. This means *where* you are paying your taxes is a crucial factor in determining the *amount* (which affects A), the *structure* (which affects B), and the *method* (which affects D).  The main consistent difference hinges on where you are paying because systems and rates are so different.
"
"Laika hta tsun da hte maren, tinang gaw sumtsan kaw bungli galaw taw ai, raitim kaga shara kaw dap daju ai rai yang, tinang a shang gumhpraw ahkum hkanse hpe gara kaw jawbang ra na rai?","The correct answer is **C: tinang bungli galaw taw nga ai mungdan hta** (in the country where you are working remotely).

The passage clearly states that income tax needs to be paid according to the country you are working from when working remotely. While there are complexities in countries like the US and Canada, the fundamental principle is tied to where you are *earning* the income (working).
"
"Mungkan Lamang hte seng nna, lawu kaw na gara gaw tup hkrak n lu gaw dan ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: mungdan hku nna shanglawm nra ai (It is not necessary to participate as a country).**

Here's why:

* **A, B, and C** are directly supported by the passage. The passage mentions countries showcasing their culture and history (A), botanical displays (B), and the event lasting three to six months (C).
* **D** is contradicted by the passage. The very definition of a ""mungkan lamang"" (World's Fair/Expo) in the passage states it involves participating countries: ""Shingni hte seng ai hta shang lawm ai mungdan ni..."" (Countries participating in the event...). This indicates country participation *is* required.
"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Mungkan Lamang na hkrang tara (sh) Mungdan ga daga hte seng ai tsun dan ai lam rai?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: Mungdan langai kaw na shaning shagu lamang ni hpe lamang madu n mai galaw ai**.

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Myit masat hta gaw shanhte ni shaning shagu lu galaw ai re tim mung (shanhte ni nbung ai mungdan ni kaw nga taw ai majaw grai na ai) tatut hta gaw shanhte ni nlu galaw ai."" This clearly indicates that while they aim to do it annually, the logistical challenges of different locations make it impossible to host the event every year within the same country.

Let's analyze the other options:

*   **A: madun ai rai ni gaw mungdan a labau hte mungkan manghkang lahkawng yan hpe hpaw madun ra ai** While the text mentions countries showcasing their culture and history, it doesn't specifically state they *must* address global issues.
*   **C: Lamang ni gaw shata kru ram na ra ai** The text mentions that past events lasted ""shata masum hte kru lapran"" (three to six months), so six months is just the maximum duration, not a requirement.
*   **D: Lamang galaw na matu, mungdan yawng shang lawm ra ai** The text indicates that several countries participate, but it does not suggest that *every* country has to participate."
Lawu kaw gara hpe galaw ai gaw dusat a htim kasat ai lam kaw na shayawm ya na rai?,"The best answer to reduce the risk of animal attacks based on the passage is **B: Campsite kaw na maza mala ni hpe yeng seng kau ai** (Keeping the campsite clean of trash).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions that odors attract animals like bears. Trash is a strong source of odors that will draw them in.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Manam pyaw ai tsi pawt hpe gun hkawm ai** (Carrying fragrant medicines) - the passage does not mention anyhting about medicines, but it would attract them even more
*   **C: Chyahkyawn ni kaw na sinda 25 ram tsan nga na** (Staying 25 yards away from squirrels) - This is about general safety, not specifically about preventing attacks by attracting animals in the first place.
*   **D: Dusat ni hpe lusha (jinghpa) hte pat shingdang ai** (Feeding animals) - The passage says to not feed animals.

"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw nam dusat htim kasat ai lam byin shangun ai hpe laika hta n tsun ai rai?,"The passage discusses several factors that can contribute to encounters with wild animals:

*   Wild animals are attracted to human food.
*   Humans getting too close to the animals (especially bears, who need a 100-yard distance).
*   Animals being aggressive when provoked.
*   Animals being large, wild, and dangerous in general.
*   Odors attracting animals.

The passage **does NOT** mention **A: N-gun ja ai sama (Strong wind/climate)** as a reason for wild animal attacks. Therefore, that is the correct answer.

**Final Answer: A**
