根据这段文字，以下哪项不会被认为是成功演奏手风琴的准确技巧？,"根据这段文字，用力敲击琴键来提升音量是**不**准确的技巧。文章明确指出，不用像钢琴那样用力敲击琴键来提升音量。

所以答案是 A。
"
在演奏手风琴时，以下哪些做法可以提高音量？,"The correct answers are **A: 更快的速度** and **B: 更用力**.

The passage states: ""为了提高手风琴的音量，可以更用力或以更快的速度拉风箱。"" This translates to ""To increase the volume of the accordion, you can pull the bellows more forcefully or at a faster speed.""
"
为什么电视画面的边框被裁剪了？,"The correct answer is **B: 为了让图像能覆盖住整个屏幕**.

The passage explicitly states: ""这样做是为了保证图像能覆盖住整个屏幕.这叫做“过度扫描”.""
"
根据这段文字，将电影转换成 DVD 格式时，可能会遇到以下哪个问题？,"The correct answer is **B: 字幕被部分裁剪掉**.

The text states: ""遗憾的是，当你制作 DVD 时，它的边框很可能也会被裁剪掉，而且如果视频中的字幕太靠近底部，那么字幕也会显示不完整。"" This directly indicates that subtitles can be partially cut off during the DVD conversion process due to overscan.
"
哪里有一支英国守军驻扎？,"The correct answer is C: 波登镇.

"
在以下地点中，“邓拉普宽边”最后抵达的地点是哪个？,"The correct answer is **C: 伦敦**

Here's why:

*   **伦敦:** 8月10日
*   **纽约:** 7月9日
*   **邓拉普的印刷厂:** 7月4日一夜之间
*   **独立大厅:** 7月8日

Therefore, 伦敦是“邓拉普宽边”最后抵达的地点。"
斯塔克上校的部队位于哪里？,"The best answer is **A: 在北端，沿着围栏**.

Here's why:

* The passage states ""斯塔克(Stark) 的士兵沿着殖民者阵地北端的防御围栏站位."" This directly indicates their position. While they also extended the wall to the beach (B), and the Mysterious River was nearby (C), their *primary* location as stated in the passage was along the fence at the north end. Option D is incorrect because the picket was placed in front of the fence, not Stark's soldiers.
"
根据这段文字，斯塔克的士兵在什么时候延伸他们的围栏？,"The correct answer is **C: 在退潮时**

The passage states: ""退潮时，沿半岛东北部流淌的神秘河打开了一道缺口，他们迅速建起一堵短石墙，把围墙延伸到岸边北端的小海滩上。"" (When the tide went out, the Mystic River, which flowed along the northeast of the peninsula, opened a gap, and they quickly built a short stone wall, extending the fence to the small beach on the north end of the shore.) This clearly indicates the fence extension happened when the tide went out.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪个是中国最暴力的时代之一？,"The correct answer is **D: 三国时期 (Three Kingdoms Period)**.

The text explicitly states: ""三国是中国古代历史上最血腥的时代之一 (The Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history).""
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项陈述关于行军蚁群进入迁徙阶段是正确的？,"The correct answer is **B: 它们食物供应匮乏 (They have a scarce food supply)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""当可利用的食物减少时，这个蚁群就会迎来迁徙期 (When the available food decreases, the ant colony will enter a migration period)."" This directly links the scarcity of food to the start of the migration phase.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 它们在夜间筑巢 (They build nests at night)**: The passage states they travel at night and build nests during the day.
* **C: 它们建造的巢穴每 17 天更换一次 (They build nests that are changed every 17 days)**: The passage mentions that during migration, they build temporary nests that are changed *daily*, and the entire migratory period lasts around 17 days.
* **D: 它们在白天出行 (They travel during the day)**: The passage explicitly states that they travel at night.
"
根据这段文字，哪项陈述准确反映了军蚁群体在游牧阶段的筑巢习惯？,"The correct answer is **C: 它们每天更换巢穴**.

The passage states: ""在这一阶段，蚁群会建造每天更换的临时巢穴。"" (In this phase, the ant colony builds temporary nests that are changed daily.) This directly supports option C.
"
以下哪项尽管存在外界提示也会持续发生？,"The correct answer is **C: 生物钟 (Biological clocks)**.

Here's why:

*   **P states:** ""生物钟是能够自我维持的摆动装置，即使在没有外界提示的情况下，也会持续一段时间自由运转的周期。"" (Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to cycle for a period of time in the absence of external cues).
*   **Q asks:** which continues to occur despite the presence of external cues?
*   The passage explicitly states that biological clocks *continue* to run even without external cues. Therefore, the presence of external cues wouldn't stop them.

Let's examine the other options:

*   **A: 内生周期 (Endogenous cycles):** While endogenous cycles are produced by biological clocks, the question asks what *continues* despite external cues. Biological clocks are the *mechanism* that makes endogenous cycles possible. Thus, biological clocks are the better answer.
*   **B: 周期性的节奏 (Periodic rhythms):** The passage states that periodic rhythms are *not* simply reactions to external cues but are influenced by biological clocks. However, the degree of that influence relative to external cues is unclear.
*   **D: 观察到的节律 (Observed rhythms):** The observed rhythms could be partly influenced or even changed or disrupted by external cues.

Because the passage directly describes the capacity of biological clocks to function in the absence of external cues, it is the best answer."
哪个术语描述了展示某一表型性状变体的个体？,"The correct answer is **D: 多态**.

The passage states: ""当个体表现出某一性状的几个变体时，它们就是多态的。"" (When individuals exhibit several variants of a particular trait, they are polymorphic.)
"
以下哪项是指占据特定区域的生物体？,"The correct answer is **B: 种群**.

The passage states: ""种群是指在特定地理区域内特定种类生物体的集合。"" (A population is a collection of organisms of a particular kind in a specific geographic area.)

Therefore, the definition of a population is a group of organisms occupying a particular area.
"
以下哪项不是以自然风光旅游活动的例子？,"The passage defines nature-based tourism as activities related to natural areas, wildlife, and ecosystems.

*   A: Hiking to a waterfall is a nature-based activity.
*   B: Photographing wildflowers is a nature-based activity.
*   C: Visiting a science museum is generally not considered a nature-based activity, as it focuses on exhibits and education rather than direct interaction with nature.
*   D: Fly fishing is a nature-based activity.

Therefore, the answer is **C**.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项是交通系统的基础？,"The passage states that ""In this dynamic traffic shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supporting a private car-based transport system."" This directly points to private cars being the foundation of the traffic system described.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: 私家车 (Private cars)**.
"
绕原子核运动的粒子具有哪种类型的电荷？,"The text states: ""电子带有负电 (electrons have a negative charge).""

Therefore, the answer is:

C: 负电 (negative charge)
"
原子核由哪种粒子组成？,"正确的答案是 **A: 质子和中子**

原文明确说明了 ""原子核由中子和质子这两种粒子组成。""
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项是五位二进制数的例子？,"根据原文：

*   **二进制数只能占两个值里的其中一个，即0或者1。**
*   **二进制数字被称为“位”。**

选项分析：

*   A: 1010 包含的都是0和1，但是只有4位。
*   B: 12001 包含2，不符合二进制数的定义。
*   C: 10010 包含的都是0和1，并且有5位。
*   D: 110101 包含的都是0和1，但是有6位。

所以答案是 **C: 10010**
"
二进制数字也被称为什么？,"正确答案是 **A: 位**

原文中明确指出，“二进制数只能占两个值里的其中一个，即0或者1，而这样的数被称为二进制数字，即计算机术语中的“位”。”
"
以下哪项没有被提及作为学生博客的主要好处？,"The correct answer is **B: 来自同伴的批判减少**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 语法和写作水平的提高:** The passage explicitly states that students improve their grammar and spelling as they blog.
*   **C: 扩大对周遭环境的认识:** The passage mentions that blogging ""迫使学生对周遭世界更具洞察力“.
*   **D: 增加对继续学习的渴望:** The passage says writing motivates students to extend learning beyond traditional schoolwork.

The passage explicitly mentions that students try to avoid criticisms, so the fact that the students' criticism decreases is not one of the blog's benefits.
"
以下哪个博客方面被引用作为激励学生提高写作能力的因素？,"The correct answer is **B: 渴望避免批判 (Keenness to avoid criticism)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""学生往往是最挑剔的读者，所以博客作者开始努力提高写作水平，避免受到批判 (Students are often the most critical readers, so bloggers begin to improve their writing to avoid criticism).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 频繁回应网络材料 (Frequent responses to online material)**: While the passage mentions responding to online materials, this is presented as a way to develop analytical and critical thinking skills, not directly as a motivator for improving writing ability.
*   **C: 保持观众的兴趣 (Maintaining audience interest)**: This is mentioned as a motivator for students to become insightful and engaging, but not directly as a motivator for *writing ability*.
*   **D: 对合作的需要 (The need for collaboration)**: Collaboration is mentioned as a benefit of blogging, but not as a direct motivator for improving writing skills."
以下哪项不是异步通讯对学生的好处？ ,"The correct answer is **B: 可以在任何时间与老师面对面沟通 (Can communicate face-to-face with the teacher at any time)**.

Here's why:

*   **Asynchronous communication** means there's a delay between sending and receiving messages. Face-to-face communication is, by definition, synchronous (real-time). The passage specifically discusses the advantages of *not* having to wait for face-to-face meetings.
*   **A: 使用互联网作为资源 (Using the internet as a resource)**: The passage explicitly mentions students using the internet and World Wide Web for information.
*   **C: 弹性工作时间 (Flexible work hours)**: The passage mentions flexible work hours as a benefit related to asynchronous communication.
*   **D: 控制节奏 (Control the pace)**: The passage states that asynchronous communication allows students to learn at their own pace."
根据这段文字，以下哪个异步通讯方面对学生来说不是灵活的？,"The correct answer is **B: 工作时间 (Working hours)**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 学习节奏 (Learning pace):** The passage explicitly states asynchronous communication allows students to learn at their own pace.
*   **C: 教学材料 (Instructional materials):** The passage says learners can access information anytime using the internet and the World Wide Web, indicating flexibility in accessing teaching materials.
*   **D: 互联网使用 (Internet usage):** The passage mentions that learners can use the Internet and World Wide Web anytime to obtain information.
*   **B: 工作时间 (Working hours):** The passage mentions that flexible working hours are an advantage due to asynchronous communication, **not** for students, but more in a general sense. The focus is on flexible working hours in a general sense related to asynchronous communication. So, the absence of mention regarding the flexibility of working hours **for students** regarding this kind of communication makes this the best answer.

**Therefore, the aspect of asynchronous communication that is NOT presented as flexible for students in the passage is ""工作时间 (Working hours).""**"
以下哪个在文中没有被提到作为中世纪城堡可能相关的事物？,"The passage mentions the following:

*   **A: 地牢坑 (Dungeon pits):** ""闻到从地牢坑里冒出来的恐惧气息 (smell the fear emanating from the dungeon pits)""
*   **B: 马背长矛比武 (Jousting):** ""让人联想到马背长矛比武的画面 (conjures images of mounted jousting)""
*   **C: 骑士精神 (Chivalry):** ""亚瑟王骑士精神 (Arthurian chivalry)""

The passage mentions ""亚瑟王骑士精神"" (Arthurian chivalry), but does not explicitly mention **""骑士"" (Knights)** as a distinct related item. While it's implied that knights were involved in chivalry and jousting, the passage itself doesn't specifically name them as a separate element associated with the castles.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: 骑士 (Knights)**
"
以下哪个在文中没有被提到作为在城堡废墟中可能闻到的味道或听到的声音？,"The correct answer is **C: 宴会 (Yànhuì - Banquet)**.

The passage mentions:

*   Sounds of war (战争 - Zhànzhēng)
*   Smell of fear from the dungeon pit (恐惧 - Kǒngjù)
*   Sound of horses' hooves on cobblestones (马蹄声 - Mǎtí shēng)

It does **not** say you can smell or hear banquets in the ruins, only that the castle evokes images of banquets."
以下哪项是克尔比墨斯鲁城堡的准确描述？,"The correct answer is **B: 由于当时国家的和平性质，它需要最少的防御工事**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""这个国家还相对和平，只需要防御一小群四处游荡的抢掠者."" This directly implies that minimal defenses were needed due to the peaceful nature of the time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 这座城堡的厚墙是由黑斯廷斯勋爵要求建造的:** The passage explicitly states the *opposite*: the walls were thin, not thick.
* **C: 这座城堡的建造不符合当时的典型风格:** The passage says it was *typical* for that period: ""作为那段时期的典型建筑...""
* **D: 它被建造来经受长时间坚决的攻击:** The passage states it *couldn't* withstand a determined attack due to its large windows and thin walls.
"
在描述的时期内，以下哪项建造特征被认为是克尔比墨斯鲁城堡不寻常的？,"The passage states that ""Its large glass windows and thin walls could not have withstood a determined attack for long."" This implies that large windows and thin walls were unusual for a structure meant to be fortified. Since the passage also states it's more like a fortified house than a true castle, having fewer defenses is also implied, but the window and thin wall details are more directly linked to the idea of ""unusual"" for a building of that type.

Let's examine each option:

*   **A: 巨大的窗户 (Large windows):** The passage explicitly mentions large windows as a weakness in resisting attack, implying they were not typical of truly fortified structures. This is a strong contender.
*   **B: 为抵挡攻击而建的基础 (Foundation built to withstand attack):** The passage doesn't discuss the foundation. We can assume a castle or fortified structure has some kind of base for defending but there is no indication of this being unusual.
*   **C: 比一些城堡更少的防御工事 (Fewer fortifications than some castles):** While true (the passage says it's more like a fortified house), this is a more general statement. The question asks about *specific* building features.
*   **D: 薄墙 (Thin walls):** The passage explicitly mentions thin walls as a weakness in resisting attack, implying they were not typical of truly fortified structures. This is a strong contender.

Both A and D are possibilities. However, based on the prompt's specific use of ""unusual"", I think we should consider these words to be similar to ""atypical"". Thus, although thin walls are a feature of the castle, large windows are a more unusual and atypical feature to have in a castle/fortified home.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: 巨大的窗户 (Large windows)**."
根据这段文字，以下哪项对于一名准备参加即将到来的赛季的跑步选手来说最有益？,"The best answer is **D: 利用健身房锻炼上半身**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of winter cross-country running and upper body workouts to prepare for the running season.** Since the question asks what is *most* beneficial for a runner preparing for an upcoming season, this directly relates to the provided information.

Let's eliminate the other options:

* **A: 在夏天练习越野跑:** The passage specifically mentions cross-country running in the *winter* as preparation.
* **B: 专注于培养速度而进行训练:** The passage states that endurance becomes paramount in the half-mile run, making speed less crucial.
* **C: 在三分钟内跑完:** The passage mentions that a top half-mile runner needs to finish in under two minutes, not three.

Therefore, **D** is the only option supported by the text.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项对于一名一流的半英里跑步选手来说最为重要？,"The correct answer is **B: 培养耐力而非速度**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""从四分之一英里转变为半英里的赛跑，速度变得不那么重要了，耐力成为绝对重要的因素."" (Switching from a quarter-mile to a half-mile run, speed becomes less important, and endurance becomes absolutely important.) While speed is still needed, the emphasis is on endurance.
* **A is not as important:** While helpful, winter cross-country running is just one component of preparation. It doesn't represent the *most* important factor for a successful half-mile runner.
* **C is a goal, not a method:** Running under two minutes is the benchmark of a top-tier runner, but it doesn't tell us *how* to become one. It's a consequence of training, particularly endurance.
* **D is incorrect:** The passage directly contradicts this by saying speed is *less* important than endurance.
"
对于一名运动员，以下哪项不可能仅靠营养实践来实现？,"The correct answer is **C: 出色表现 (Outstanding performance)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""仅靠适当的营养实践并不足以造就出色表现 (Appropriate nutritional practices alone are not enough to create outstanding performance).""

The other options are mentioned as things that nutrition *can* significantly impact:

*   A: 改善表现 (Improve performance) - The passage says good nutrition can *help* improve performance.
*   B: 增加乐趣 (Increase enjoyment) - The passage explicitly mentions this.
*   D: 整体健康状况 (Overall health) - The passage says it can significantly impact this.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不是年轻运动员在运动中寻找更多乐趣的建议？,"The correct answer is **B: 一直保持出色表现**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that proper nutrition, hydration, and supplement knowledge can help athletes improve performance and *increase enjoyment* of sports.
*   Options A (实践适当的营养), C (有效补充水分), and D (保持健康的能量平衡) are all directly mentioned as ways to improve performance and, by extension, increase enjoyment.
*   Option B (一直保持出色表现) is not mentioned in the passage and is not necessarily something that nutrition can directly control. The passage implies that nutrition aids in improved performance *and* enjoyment, but doesn't guarantee constant stellar performance. Also, focusing only on being ""出色表现"" may lead to frustration and less enjoyment."
根据这段文字，为什么一名中长跑参与者可能会购买更昂贵的装备？,"The correct answer is **D: 围绕相对低廉的装备存在误解**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that while middle- and long-distance running is a relatively inexpensive sport, participants often have misconceptions about the gear they need.
*   The passage also mentions that athletes might *believe* a product is beneficial, even if it isn't.

**Why the other options are incorrect:**

*   **A: 这是他们个人的偏好** While personal preference *could* play a role, the passage focuses on the **misconceptions** that drive the purchases. It's not just about liking something; it's about believing it helps performance.
*   **B: 这已经被证明有益** The passage explicitly contradicts this, stating that most products have little to no actual impact on performance.
*   **C: 这会极大地影响他们的表现** Again, the passage says most products don't significantly affect performance.

Therefore, option D aligns most accurately with the information provided in the text."
根据这段文字，中长跑需要什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 很少的装备**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that middle and long-distance running is a relatively inexpensive sport and that ""most products have little practical effect on performance.""
*   This suggests that you don't need a lot of equipment to participate effectively.
*   The passage explicitly states that athletes may wrongly believe they need certain products, implying that many of these products are unnecessary.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 大量的装备:** The passage contradicts this directly.
*   **B: 成熟的运动背景:** The passage doesn't mention prior sports experience.
*   **D: 大量的金钱:** The passage states the sport is relatively inexpensive."
是谁发现了核磁共振？ ,"The correct answer is **C: 布洛赫和珀塞耳**.

The passage clearly states: ""核磁共振成像依据的是一种叫核磁共振 (NMR) 的物理现象，它是费利克斯·布洛赫（在斯坦福大学工作）和爱德华·珀塞耳（来自哈佛大学）于 20 世纪 30 年代发现的.""
"
第一个医学成像共振专利是在哪一年获得的？ ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

The passage states: ""Four years later, a patent was approved, representing the world's first patent awarded in the field of MRI."" Since Damadian discovered the principle in 1970, the patent was approved in 1974.
"
根据这段文字，为了解释他人的身体行为，人类应该对什么有很强的理解？,"The correct answer is **B: 意图 (Intentions)**.

The passage explicitly states that ""理解他人意图至关重要 (understanding others' intentions is essential)"" and provides an example of how understanding intentions helps us interpret ambiguous physical actions. The example illustrates how the *intention* behind breaking a car window dramatically changes the interpretation of the action.
"
根据这段文字，理解意图有助于人类做什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 消除身体行为背后的不确定性**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that understanding intention is crucial because it allows us to understand ambiguous bodily actions. The example of the broken car window illustrates this perfectly: the action is ambiguous (could be theft or legitimate entry), and understanding the *intention* behind the action helps us resolve the uncertainty.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: 预测欲望:** While understanding intention might *inform* predictions about desires, the text doesn't explicitly state it directly leads to predicting desires.
*   **C: 不带偏见地看待其他人:** The passage doesn't discuss bias.
*   **D: 读懂他人的心理:** While intention is part of understanding someone's psychology, the passage focuses on how understanding intention clarifies specific *actions*, not a general comprehension of another person's mind.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项是 AI 主要目的的准确概括？,"The correct answer is **D: 任务自动化**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""人工智能 (AI) 的研究涉及制造机器让需要智能行为的任务自动化。"" This directly identifies task automation as a primary focus of AI research.

The other options are examples of tasks that AI can be applied to, but they are not the overarching purpose of AI.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项常常与 AI 相关联？,"The passage mentions the following as examples of AI:

*   Control, planning, and scheduling
*   Responding to customer diagnoses and customer problems
*   Handwriting recognition
*   Voice and facial functions

It also mentions that AI has a strong science fiction feel.

Let's look at the options:

*   A: Customer service - This is related to ""responding to customer diagnoses and customer problems"".
*   B: Planning and scheduling - This is explicitly mentioned.
*   C: Science fiction - This is mentioned as a common association.
*   D: Handwriting recognition - This is explicitly mentioned.

The question asks what is *often* associated with AI. While customer service, planning/scheduling, and handwriting recognition are all examples of AI applications, the passage states that AI has a strong science fiction feel. Thus, the best answer is science fiction.

Therefore, the best answer is **C: 科幻小说** (Science fiction)."
根据这段文字，以下哪项是具有收敛思维模式的人的优点？,"The correct answer is **D: 记忆模式**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that people with a convergent thinking style are able to ""remember patterns"".
*   The passage states收敛思维模式看重的是速度，与C选项“花时间解决问题”相反
*   The passage states收敛思维模式寻找的是唯一正确答案，与A选项“甄别问题的多个正确答案”矛盾
*   The passage states收敛思维模式看重的是对现有技术的重新应用，与B选项“新技术应用到问题上”相反"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不被认为是收敛思维模式的关注点？,"根据这段文字，收敛思维模式看重的是速度、逻辑和准确性。选项B“慢慢来”与“速度”相悖，因此不被认为是收敛思维模式的关注点。

所以答案是：B
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不被认为是微表情？,"The passage states that microexpressions are ""facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds."" Of the options provided:

*   **A: Looking away while speaking:** This could indicate discomfort or dishonesty, but is not a facial movement.
*   **B: Frowning:** This is a facial movement.
*   **C: Rapid blinking:** This is a facial movement.
*   **D: Thumbs up:** Thumbs up is a gesture, not a facial movement.

The question asks which is *not* considered a microexpression. The passage defines microexpressions as facial movements. Option A and D are not facial movements.
However, the passage is specifically discussing facial movements, so the best answer from the given choices is:

**A: Looking away while speaking**
**D: Thumbs up**
Looking at the options given, A is the best answer, because it is not a facial movement, or a micro facial movement.

Therefore, the answer is **A**."
以下哪个有关微表情解读的陈述不正确？,"The answer is **C: 语言和面部表情都被解读**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 录像带来了重大进展 (Recording has brought about great progress)** - The passage explicitly states that the use of recordings has led to significant discoveries in interpreting microexpressions. This is true according to the passage.
*   **B: 正确解读可判断是否撒谎 (Correct interpretation can determine whether someone is lying)** - The passage says that it is ""said"" that microexpressions can be used to detect lies. This is presented as something believed to be true.
*   **D: 它可以帮助判断诚意 (It can help determine sincerity)** - Oliver Sacks' observation about brain-damaged individuals and animals supports the idea that microexpressions contribute to judging sincerity.
*   **C: 语言和面部表情都被解读 (Language and facial expressions are both interpreted)** - While the passage mentions language, it contrasts language understanding with the ability to perceive sincerity through (primarily facial) cues. It doesn't suggest that both language *and* facial expressions are *both* being interpreted in the context of microexpression reading. The point is that even when language comprehension is impaired, sincerity can still be judged.

Therefore, the statement that is NOT supported by the passage is **C**."
文艺复兴后，以下哪项变得更加重要？ ,"The passage states: ""压力不再存在于个人回忆中，但回忆文本的能力变得更加重要。"" which translates to ""The pressure is no longer on individual recall, but the ability to recall texts becomes more important.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 文本回忆 (Text recall)**.
"
作为文艺复兴的结果，以下哪个得到的重视减少了？,"The passage states: ""压力不再存在于个人回忆中，但回忆文本的能力变得更加重要。"" This translates to: ""The emphasis is no longer on personal recall, but the ability to recall texts becomes more important.""

Therefore, the answer is **A: 个人回忆 (Personal recall)**, as the passage explicitly states that the emphasis on personal recall decreased.
"
以下哪个不反映使用互联网维持人际关系的动机？,"The passage mentions ""learning"" and ""socializing"" as motivations for using the internet, and ""personal involvement"" and ""ongoing relationships"" as factors in website audience response. All of these relate to human connection.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Commercial socializing** - While it might involve some professional interactions, it doesn't inherently focus on building or maintaining *personal* relationships.
*   **B: Keeping in touch with family** - This is directly related to maintaining personal relationships.
*   **C: Researching travel** - This is a form of learning and does not necessarily involve interacting with other people or maintaining relationships.
*   **D: Meeting new people** - This is directly related to establishing personal relationships.

Therefore, the option that does *not* reflect using the internet to maintain personal relationships is **C: Researching travel**.

**Final Answer: C**"
以下哪项不反映出使用互联网进行个人参与的动机？,"The passage discusses ""personal involvement"" and ""ongoing relationship"" as motivations for using the internet.

*   **A: 查找食谱 (Finding a recipe)** - This is primarily about information gathering and does not necessarily involve personal involvement or building relationships.
*   **B: 在线上讨论板上发帖 (Posting on online discussion boards)** - This directly involves participating in a community and interacting with others, thus reflecting personal involvement.
*   **C: 研究医疗保健产品 (Researching health care products)** - This relates to personal well-being and making informed decisions. This act of research does not inherently involve interacting with others or personal involvement beyond oneself.
*   **D: 管理财务 (Managing finances)** - This involves personal management and control over one's resources, but doesn't inherently require interaction with others or establishing relationships.

Therefore, the option that LEAST reflects personal involvement in the sense described in the passage is **A: 查找食谱 (Finding a recipe)**. Although one could share recipes, the initial act of finding it is a solitary activity.

The other options (B, C and D) all involve some element of ""personal involvement,"" but they also entail varying degrees of personal relevance. C and D entail involvement regarding personal matters, but A focuses on one task without further personal relevance.
Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{A}$"
西欧何时停止严重依赖影响并开始发展自己的风格？,"The correct answer is **A: 大约在中世纪末期**.

The passage states: ""随着中世纪走向末期，西欧人民逐渐发展出自己的风格."" This directly translates to ""As the Middle Ages drew to a close, the people of Western Europe gradually developed their own style.""
"
使用纽扣系衣服是什么的结果？ ,"The correct answer is **C: 十字军东征**.

The passage states: ""当时最大的进步之一就是十字军东征后，人们开始用纽扣来系衣服 (One of the biggest advancements at the time was that after the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten clothes)."" This clearly links the use of buttons to the Crusades.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项被认为是解决环境问题的可行长期方案？,"The correct answer is **C: 找到问题的根源 (Find the root of the problem)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that while actions like joining environmental movements are helpful in the short term (""symptom relief""), a lasting solution requires addressing the *root cause* of the problem.  The passage goes on to identify overpopulation and luxurious lifestyles as contributing factors. Option C directly reflects this idea.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: 抵制奢侈的生活方式选择 (Resisting luxurious lifestyle choices):** While this is a mentioned in the passage, it is only one part of the root of the problem, not the root itself.
* **B: 成为积极分子 (Becoming an activist):** The passage explicitly labels this as similar to symptom treatment, a temporary fix, not a long-term solution.
* **D: 加入环保运动 (Joining the environmental movement):** Same as B, the passage considers this a symptom treatment.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪种解决方案不会被认为是环境问题的症状疗法？,"The passage states that becoming more environmentally friendly, joining the environmental movement, and even becoming an activist are similar to symptom treatment. It also states that to find a lasting solution, one should find and eradicate the root of the problem.

*   **A: 成为积极分子 (Becoming an activist):** The passage explicitly mentions this as being similar to symptom treatment.
*   **B: 消除问题的根源 (Eliminating the root cause of the problem):** The passage explicitly states that this is the kind of solution that's *not* just a temporary fix, i.e., not a symptom treatment.
*   **C: 发表关于奢侈的生活方式的意见 (Expressing opinions on luxurious lifestyles):** This isn't explicitly mentioned, but it could be seen as advocacy or a starting point to address the cause but on its own, it doesn't address the root cause directly.
*   **D: 更环保地生活 (Living more environmentally friendly):** The passage explicitly mentions this as being similar to symptom treatment.

Therefore, the solution that would *not* be considered a symptom treatment is **B: 消除问题的根源 (Eliminating the root cause of the problem)**.

**Final Answer: B**"
在哪个国家发生了欧洲第一场核心问题与宗教背景无关，而是与权力的平衡有关的战争？,"The passage states: ""The War of Spanish Succession marked the first war with the balance of power as the central issue.""

Therefore, the answer is **D: 西班牙 (Spain)**, as the War of **Spanish** Succession is the key event.
"
哪场战争有时被描述为最后一场“宗教战争”？,"The correct answer is **A: 三十年战争**.

The passage explicitly states that ""三十年战争将是最后一场被贴上宗教战争标签的战争.""
"
以下天主教会的哪个方面没有受到密切监督？,"The passage states that the church was under scrutiny due to its wealth and power concentration and whether it was adhering to its tenet of using wealth to alleviate suffering. This directly relates to options A, C, and D. The passage doesn't mention any scrutiny regarding modifying religious beliefs.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: 宗教的主要信条是否应该修改**.
"
根据这段文字，在凡尔赛宫谁被杀害了？,"The correct answer is **D: 一名卫士**.

The passage states: ""有一名暴徒一度挥动一颗皇家卫士的头颅，这名卫士是在凡尔赛宫被杀害的."" This clearly indicates that a royal guard was killed at Versailles.
"
以下哪项不是由暴民强加于国王和王后的？,"The answer is C: 观看警卫的斩首

Here's why:

*   **A: 打开他们的马车窗户** - The passage explicitly states that the mob *forced* the King and Queen to open the carriage windows fully.
*   **B: 立即离开凡尔赛宫** - The passage says they were ""driven from Versailles"" by the crowd.
*   **D: 返回巴黎的行程** - The passage clearly indicates they were forced to return to Paris.
*   **C: 观看警卫的斩首** - While the Queen was horrified by the sight of a guard's head being waved around, the passage doesn't indicate that they were ordered to watch it. It was simply something that happened in their presence.

Therefore, the one action that wasn't *imposed* on them by the mob is C.
"
以下哪项不是英国非传统海战的结果？,"The correct answer is **C: 对国际法进行了修改**. Here's why:

*   **A: 德国希望采用类似的战术:** The passage explicitly states this: ""Because of the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to their unrestricted submarine warfare.""
*   **B: 无关的船只置身危险之中:** The passage says ""preventing any ships from entering entire areas, even posing a threat to neutral ships."" This means irrelevant (neutral) ships were put in danger.
*   **D: 关键供应物资无法获得:** The passage says the British ""cut off vital military and civilian supplies.""

*   **C: 对国际法进行了修改:** The passage states the British tactics *violated* international law. It *doesn't* say the law was changed. In fact, the lack of significant response despite the violation is what emboldened Germany."
以下哪项陈述没有准确描述英国对德国的海上封锁？,"The passage states that the British blockade ""prevented any ship from entering entire areas, even posing a threat to neutral ships."" This directly contradicts option D, which states that the blockade ensured neutral ships would not be threatened.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: 确保中立船只不会受到威胁**.
"
根据这段文字，谁最可能被诊断出患有多发性硬化症？,"The answer is **A: 一个 32 岁的女性**. Here's why:

*   **Age:** The passage states MS is a major neurological disease in young to middle-aged adults. A 32-year-old fits this demographic better than a 15-year-old, 43-year-old or 10-year-old.
*   **Gender:** The passage explicitly states that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.

Therefore, a 32-year-old woman is the most likely among the choices to be diagnosed with MS."
根据这段文字，参与定期训练的人在哪方面需要更多的支持？,"The answer is **A: 对疼痛的被动感知**.

The text explicitly states: ""参与定期训练的人在对疼痛的被动感知方面需要更多支持，以帮助他们区分慢性疼痛和不适感与正常身体运动的区别.""
"
根据这段文字，击剑通常是以什么方式进行的？,"The correct answer is **D: 以对决形式**.

The passage explicitly states: ""这项运动主要以对决的形式进行，也就是一个击剑手与另一个击剑手进行对决"" (This sport is mainly conducted in the form of duels, that is, one fencer duels against another fencer).
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项是体内中毒的最有力指示物？,"The passage states: ""摄入毒物的最有力指示物可能是现场被打开的容器，里面装有药物或家用有毒化学品。"" This translates to ""The strongest indicator of poison ingestion may be an open container containing drugs or household toxic chemicals at the scene.""

Therefore, the correct answer is closest to **D: 处方药瓶 (Prescription drug bottle)**, since it is a type of container that could contain poison.
"
根据这段文字，检查受害者时应该采取的适当的第一步是什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 勘察现场** (Scout the scene).

The text explicitly states: ""要检查受害者，你必须先勘察现场，确保自身的安全 (To check on a victim, you must first scout the scene and ensure your own safety)."" This clearly identifies scouting the scene as the first step.
"
以下哪种陈述没有准确反映检查受害者的过程？,"The statement that does not accurately reflect the process of checking on a victim is:

*   **A: 不用担心自己受伤 (Don't worry about getting injured)**

The passage explicitly states that you need to ensure your own safety first. Option A contradicts that.
"
在法国大革命中，哪项变革对工人阶级公民产生了重大影响？,"The best answer is **B: 重点从阶级转移到能力 (Emphasis shifted from class to ability)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""官职面向全体男性开放申请，这使得最有抱负、最成功之人有机会飞黄腾达 (Official positions were open to all men, giving the most ambitious and successful the opportunity to rise)."" This reflects a shift from positions being determined by birth and class to being based on ability and merit.
*   The passage also states: ""军队亦然，因为军衔的高低不再基于等级，而是基于才干 (The army was the same, as ranks were no longer based on rank, but on talent)."" This further emphasizes the meritocratic shift.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: 对国家的支持增加了 (Support for the nation increased):** While nationalism was a result, the passage's *direct* impact on the worker class is more about opportunity.
*   **C: 采用了共和制思想 (Adopted republican ideas):** This is a political outcome, but the core benefit to the worker class discussed is about social mobility.
*   **D: 新的度量单位 (New units of measurement):** This is a significant change, but not a *major* impact on the worker class in terms of individual opportunities.

Therefore, option B most accurately reflects the described changes and their impact on the worker class."
随着法国大革命的发生，军事和其他职业的成功更不太可能基于哪些因素？,"The passage explicitly states that ""the high ranks in the army were no longer based on rank but on merit."" This means that **B: Class** is the correct answer. Before the revolution, social class would have been a major factor in determining advancement. The revolution shifted the focus to talent instead.
"
据说在发达国家中哪种公共服务引起的怨言最为严重？,"The passage directly states that complaints about transportation systems are more common and severe than those about water quality or bridge collapses. Therefore, public transportation is the correct answer.

The correct answer is **C: 公共交通**.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪种关于公共交通系统的说法是正确的？,"The correct answer is **C: 使用的人有很多怨言 (Using people have many complaints)**.

The passage explicitly states that ""几乎每个人都对交通系统有怨言 (almost everyone has complaints about the transportation system).""  The other options are contradicted by or not mentioned in the passage.
"
根据这段文字，由于驾驶员的不可预测性，以下哪个因素可能会很难衡量？,"The passage states:

*   Traffic flow studies the movement and interaction of drivers and vehicles.
*   It's difficult to study traffic flow because driver behavior is not perfectly predictable.
*   However, driver behavior is reasonably consistent, so traffic flow also has some consistency that can be mathematically represented.
*   Relationships between flow, density, and speed are used to represent traffic flow.

While the passage implies driver unpredictability makes *studying* traffic flow difficult in general, it doesn't explicitly state that it makes measuring any of the individual factors (flow, density, or speed) particularly difficult. The passage does state that relationships are made between these factors to represent traffic flow. Out of these three factors, speed is explicitly mentioned, and the question is asking which one is hard to measure. Therefore, the closest answer is:

*   **A: Traffic speed**

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Road planning:** The passage states these relationships are *helpful* for road planning, not that they are difficult to measure.
*   **C: Road operation:** Same as road planning, the passage mentions that the relationships are *helpful* for road operation.
*   **D: Traffic flow:** The passage states that traffic flow is ""difficult to study"" so it is very close to the correct answer, but the passage is talking about relationships between flow, density, and **speed**.

"
在用数学方式表示交通流量时，使用以下哪个因素？,"The passage explicitly states that the following three main features are related to better represent traffic flow: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed. Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Traffic density**.
"
赫希及崔斯用什么来植入他们的 DNA？ ,"The correct answer is **D: 病毒**

Here's why:

The passage states that Hershey and Chase used **噬菌体或病毒** (bacteriophages or viruses) to insert their DNA into bacteria. The question asks what they used to implant their DNA, and the passage answers directly with viruses/bacteriophages. The other options are substances they used to mark the virus, or a general concept.
"
一个突变能否遗传给后代取决于什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 细胞是否为生殖系**

The passage explicitly states: ""只有生殖细胞的突变才会遗传给孩子"" which directly translates to ""Only mutations in germ cells will be inherited by children."" This means whether the affected cell is a germ cell determines if the mutation is heritable.
"
根据文中提供的信息，突变的各种影响不依赖于以下哪些因素？,"The correct answer is **A: 受影响遗传物质的数量**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the diverse impacts of mutations *depend* on:

*   The type of mutation
*   The importance of the affected genetic material
*   Whether the affected cell is a germ cell (reproductive cell)

The passage does *not* mention the quantity or amount of affected genetic material as a factor that influences the impact of mutations. Thus, that's the one factor that the impact of mutations *does not* depend on, according to the passage.
"
以下哪项不是古代文明驯养山羊的原因？,"The passage states that ancient civilizations domesticated goats for their milk, meat, hair, and skin. It does not mention companionship or eating grass as a reason.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: They provided companionship**.
"
高尔夫的目标是获得最少的什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 击球次数** because the passage states that the player with the fewest number of strokes or swings to complete the course wins.
"
高尔夫球场上，哪里的草被修剪得更短？,"The correct answer is **B: 在果岭**

The passage states: ""比赛是在草地上进行的，洞周围的草被修剪得更短，被称为果岭。"" (The game is played on grass, and the grass around the hole is trimmed shorter and called the green.)
"
实验的典型目的是什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 消除一个或多个可能性假设**.

The passage states, ""实验是一种用来消除一个或多个可能性假设的试验..."" which directly defines the purpose of experiments.
"
根据这段文字，哪个选项不能帮助指导科学研究？,"The passage states that ""提出问题及进行观察也可以指导科学研究"" (asking questions and making observations can also guide scientific research), and that ""实验是一种用来消除一个或多个可能性假设的试验"" (experiments are a way to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses).

The passage also says the scientific method ""可为大多数科学研究提供指导"" (can guide most scientific research), but it doesn't say it's the *only* way. It implies other methods exist.

Option A says ""只用科学方法"" (only using the scientific method). The passage implies this might be too restrictive, as other methods besides strict adherence to ""the"" scientific method can also guide research. The other options are explicitly mentioned as helpful, while using *only* the scientific method is not encouraged. Therefore, that is the answer.

The answer is **A: 只用科学方法**.
"
根据这段文字，下列关于龙卷风的哪项描述不正确？,"The correct answer is **C: 大多数龙卷风持续时间超过三小时**.

The passage states that only **two percent** of tornadoes are the most violent and can last for three hours or more. This implies that the vast majority of tornadoes last for a much shorter duration.  The other options are directly supported by the text.
"
根据这段文字，下列哪项陈述准确描述了大多数龙卷风？,"Let's analyze each option based on the provided text:

*   **A: 它们通常持续三小时以上** - The text states that only 2% of tornadoes last for three hours or more. This means *most* do not.
*   **B: 它们创造出大约每小时 480 英里的风速** - The text states that *the most violent* tornadoes have winds up to 480 km/h (300 mph). This doesn't mean *most* tornadoes reach this speed.
*   **C: 它们影响的区域比其他风暴更大** - The text says the opposite: tornadoes affect a *smaller* area than other violent storms.
*   **D: 它们能将树木连根拔起** - The text states that tornadoes can uproot trees, tear boards from buildings and hurl cars into the air. This makes this statement a true attribute of most tornadoes.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: 它们能将树木连根拔起**."
在 16 世纪，人类开始进行以下哪项？,"The correct answer is **D: 制造望远镜**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the first ""true"" telescopes were made in the late 16th century.
*   While humans had been using lenses to magnify objects for thousands of years, the *telescope*, a specific combination of lenses, is what was new in the 16th century.
* The other options are incorrect:
    * A: Using lenses - Humans were using lenses long before the 16th century.
    * B: Magnifying objects - Similar to using lenses, humans have been magnifying objects for a very long time using magnifying glasses.
    * C: Making lenses - Lensmaking also predates the 16th century."
人类使用透镜放大物体有多长时间？,"The correct answer is **C: 几千年**.

The passage states: ""几千年来，人类一直在制作和使用放大镜."" (For thousands of years, humans have been making and using magnifying glasses.) This directly answers the question of how long humans have used lenses to magnify objects.
"
根据这段文字，穆罕默德的洞穴对他的精神修行或价值观有何启示？,"The correct answer is **A: He珍视平和与隔绝 (He valued peace and isolation)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes the cave as being ""completely isolated from the outside world,"" and that once inside, one is ""completely cut off."" It also states that inside you can only see the clear and beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, and that you can barely see or hear external sights and sounds. This strongly implies that the peace and isolation of the cave were conducive to Muhammad's spiritual pursuits.
*   **B:** contradicts the passage because the text emphasizes the *absence* of outside noise.
*   **C:** is incorrect, as the passage implies that Muhammad often went to the cave for contemplation, suggesting he valued spending time alone.
*   **D:** is not supported by the text. The passage only talks about the cave's physical isolation, not Muhammad's fear of being seen or heard."
根据这段文字，铁最初被用于什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 轨道**.

The passage states: ""人们逐渐意识到，如果在铁轨上放上铁片，铁轨会更稳固有效。"" This directly indicates that iron was first used on the rails themselves to reinforce them.
"
根据这段文字，为什么木伦被铁轮取代？,"The correct answer is **D: 它们被轨道上的铁片磨损**

The passage explicitly states: ""这成了普遍做法，但铁片会使木制的马车轮子磨损更严重。 最终，木轮被铁轮所取代。"" This means the iron plates on the rails caused wooden wheels to wear out, leading to their replacement with iron wheels.
"
根据这段文字，在浪漫主义时期是什么塑造了个体？,"The correct answer is **B: 地理**.

The passage states: ""在浪漫主义的背景下，地理塑造了个体..."" (In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped the individual...). While customs and culture are mentioned as being related to geography, the primary shaper of the individual, according to the text, is geography.
"
以下哪项陈述不反映技术决定论的一般观点？ ,"The passage states that technical determinism generally includes the ideas that:

1.  Technology develops largely *beyond* cultural or political influence.
2.  Technology has intrinsic ""impacts"" on society *unconstrained* by social conditions.

Option A, ""技术对社会的影响是社会条件制约的 (The impact of technology on society is constrained by social conditions)"", directly contradicts the second point. Options B, C, and D all align with the definition of technological determinism outlined in the text.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A**.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪个与拉弓无关？,"The correct answer is **A: 声音更柔和**.

Here's why:

*   The text states ""上弓通常会发出更加柔和的声音，而下弓则会发出更强烈、更为坚定的声响。"" Therefore, ""声音更柔和"" is associated with up-bow, not down-bow.

The other options are directly related to down-bow:

*   **B: 看起来像钉书钉的符号:** The text says ""下弓符号像是钉书钉...""
*   **C: 声音更强烈:** The text says ""下弓则会发出更强烈、更为坚定的声响.""
*   **D: 从弓根处开始:** The text says ""...向下指的是从弓根处（也就是手握弓的地方）开始拉弓."""
根据这段文字，以下哪项与柔和的声音有关？,"The passage states that the ""上弓"" symbol, which looks like the letter V, usually produces a softer sound. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: 像“V”形的符号**
"
化石表明，手的适应性主要用于以下哪一项？,"The passage states that ""2 million to 3 million-year-old hand fossils show changes in hand characteristics from locomotion to manipulation."" This directly supports the answer that the hand adaptations were primarily for manipulation.

Therefore, the correct answer is A: Operation (Manipulation).
"
以下哪项准确描述了黑猩猩的指（趾）骨？ ,"The correct answer is **C: 它们用于托起重物 (They are used for bearing weight)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""黑猩猩手脚的大小和长度相似，这反映出手在指背行走中用来承重的事实 (Chimpanzees have similar hand and foot size and length, reflecting the fact that the hands are used for weight-bearing during knuckle-walking)."" This directly supports that their hands are used for bearing weight.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   A: 它们比人类的更直 (They are straighter than humans) - The passage states the opposite: human finger bones are straighter.
*   B: 它们的手脚大小不同 (Their hands and feet are different sizes) - The passage states that their hands and feet are similar in size.
*   D: 它们主要用于操作 (They are mainly used for manipulation) - While chimpanzees use their hands for manipulation, the passage emphasizes their weight-bearing function. Human hands are more specialized for manipulation."
选择从哪个池中移除新的基因变异？,"The correct answer is **D: 显性**

The passage states that selection removes variations from the ""expressed gene variation pool."" Expressed gene variations are those that are phenotypically visible, which corresponds to **显性 (dominant)** traits.
"
哪个过程会添加新的基因变异？,"The passage states that ""Mutations add new gene variants"". Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Mutation**.
"
根据文中信息，哪种食物是灵长类动物为解决“蛋白质问题”而应该吃的？,"The correct answer is **C: 蚂蚱**. Here's why:

*   The passage states that animal foods like ""蚂蚁、白蚁、蛋"" are easily digestible and provide all essential amino acids. While ""蚂蚱"" isn't explicitly mentioned, it falls under the category of ""animal foods"" and therefore is a likely solution for the protein problem.
*   The passage explicitly states that leaves and raw legumes are difficult for primates to digest.

Therefore, C is the most logical answer based on the information provided."
根据这段文字，以下哪个问题不是由于缺乏必需的氨基酸引起的？,"The passage states that lack of essential amino acids leads to:

*   Growth inhibition
*   Malnutrition
*   Death

The passage also states that leaves and legumes are hard to digest. Therefore, digestive problems are not directly caused by a lack of essential amino acids, but rather by the type of food consumed.

So the answer is A.
"
一个特定亚文化的成员通常如何表示他们与该团体的关联？,"The correct answer is **D: 象征性地利用独特的行事风格**.

The passage explicitly states: ""亚文化群体的成员，常常会象征性地利用独特的行事风格来表明他们的成员身份，包括时尚服装、举止和黑话。"" (Subculture members often symbolically use distinctive styles to signify their membership, including fashion, demeanor, and slang.)

The other options are incorrect because they contradict the passage:

*   **A: 试图融入** (Trying to fit in) - While亚文化 members might *feel* like they're fitting in *within the group*, the passage emphasizes that they feel *disregarded by societal norms*.
*   **B: 接受周围每个人的信仰** (Accepting everyone's beliefs around them) - This is too broad and doesn't connect to the specific methods mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: 接受社会规范** (Accepting social norms) - The passage states that亚文化s form because individuals feel *disregarded* by social norms.

Therefore, the answer is D."
根据文中提出的理论，一个被模式化观念认为会从事威胁行为的少数族裔的孩子可能会发生什么？,"The text suggests that when children become aware of stereotypes about their own race, they tend to behave in ways that conform to those stereotypes. If a minority child is stereotyped as engaging in threatening behavior, then according to the passage, the child would be **more likely** to engage in threatening behavior.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: 孩子更有可能参与威胁行为 (The child is more likely to engage in threatening behavior).**
"
根据这段文字，一个孩子对种族刻板印象的了解可能会对以下哪个方面产生影响？,"The passage explicitly states that ""these racial stereotypes can influence their behavior."" Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: 他们的行为 (Their behavior)**
"
根据这段文字，以下哪一项不太可能符合野孩子的成长背景？,"根据这段文字，以下不太可能符合野孩子成长背景的是：

*   **B: 较强的对话能力**

**原因：**

*   这段文字描述了野孩子由于缺乏社会化，通常是被忽视、虐待或遗弃，与社会隔绝。
*   他们可能被幽禁、独自生活在野外，甚至被动物养大。
*   在这种情况下，他们缺乏与人类互动的机会，因此不太可能发展出较强的对话能力。
*   其他选项，如独立生活、隐居倾向和社交焦虑，都更符合野孩子由于缺乏社会化而可能表现出的特征。

因此，答案是 **B**。"
根据这段文字，以下哪一项准确描述了野孩子的行为？,"The passage explicitly states:

*   ""To illustrate the importance of socialization, one of the most frequently employed methods is to utilize the cases of the small number of unfortunate children...who have not been socialized in the company of adults as they grew up."" This suggests a link between the lack of socialization and their resulting behavior.
*   ""Wolf children...behave (to the extent that their physical condition allows) very much like that animal, exhibiting, for instance, fear or indifference to humans.""

Based on this, the best answer is:

**B: 野性行为可能源于缺乏社会化** (Wild behavior can stem from a lack of socialization)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 大部分野性行为是由身体缺陷引起的** (Most wild behavior is caused by physical defects) - The passage mentions physical defects as a reason for abandonment, but doesn't state it as the primary cause of wild behavior itself.
*   **C: 野性行为仅在被父母幽禁的孩子中普遍存在** (Wild behavior is only prevalent in children confined by their parents) - The passage describes multiple scenarios beyond just confinement.
*   **D: 所有野性行为都是由严重的智力缺陷引起的** (All wild behavior is caused by severe intellectual disabilities) - The passage mentions intellectual disabilities as a reason for abandonment, but doesn't state it as the primary cause of wild behavior itself."
基于这段文字，以下哪项做法与自给农业不一致？,"The correct answer is **B: 生产食品以出售给他人**.

Here's why:

* **Self-sufficient agriculture**, as defined in the passage, is about producing *only* what the farmer and their family need. Selling the food to others contradicts this core principle.
* The other options align with the description of self-sufficient agriculture:
    * **A:** Directly supports the core definition.
    * **C:** Emphasizes maximizing yield with simpler methods, which is consistent with the description.
    * **D:** Using local seeds is a feature of self-sufficient agriculture.
"
以下哪项准确描述了自给农业的做法？,"The correct answer is **D: 在一些国家，仍有农民在使用这种方式 (In some countries, farmers are still using this method)**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 这是一个完全有机的系统 (This is a completely organic system)**: The passage states it is ""usually"" organic, not completely organic.
*   **B: 它使用独特的技术来最大限度地提高产量 (It uses unique technologies to maximize yield)**: The passage states it uses relatively simple techniques, not unique ones.
*   **C: 它允许农业者在整个地区分享他们的农作物 (It allows farmers to share their crops throughout the region)**: Self-sufficient agriculture is designed to meet the needs of the farmer and their family, not for sharing crops.
*   **D: 在一些国家，仍有农民在使用这种方式 (In some countries, farmers are still using this method)**: The passage mentions that this is still the case in many developing countries."
参观博物馆属于以下哪种旅游类别？,"The passage states that ""If a person visits a specific place with the purpose of learning about its history and culture, then this type of tourism activity is referred to as cultural tourism."" Museums are places where people go to learn about history and culture.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 文化旅游** (Cultural tourism).
"
根据这段文字，以下哪个可能是休闲游客的优先事项？,"The correct answer is **B: 从他们的日常生活中抽身出来 (Escape from their daily lives)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that leisure travel is about ""relaxing and recreation"" in a place ""distinctly different from their everyday lives.""
*   Options A, C, and D are all related to cultural tourism, which is a different type of travel described in the passage."
文中提到了什么有助于减轻当地教会对变化的恐惧感？,"The passage explicitly states: ""回顾之前的创业行为和取得的成功可以帮助人们对当地教会的新变化和新方向保持开放的态度。 这样的成功故事让人们对变化的恐惧感减轻了..."". This directly corresponds to option A.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: 回顾成功的创业行为**.
"
根据这段文字，了解自己的历史有什么帮助？,"The correct answer is **A: 减轻对变化的恐惧感**.

Here's why:

* **A: 减轻对变化的恐惧感:** The passage directly states: ""这样的成功故事让人们对变化的恐惧感减轻了，同时为未来的变革营造出正面的倾向。"" This is a direct consequence of understanding history.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate or incomplete:

* **B: 强化价值观:** While the passage mentions a deeper understanding of values, it frames it as a *result* of summarizing successes and failures *after* understanding history, not a direct benefit of understanding history itself.

* **C: 在组织中找到自己的位置:** The passage states that understanding history ""can at least help people understand their place in the organization's history."" However, that is just a starting point, as it also mentions how history can affect good and bad things.

* **D: 改善创业行为:** The passage mentions that reviewing previous successful entrepreneurial behaviors can help, but the overarching idea is that it helps people be more open to change, not necessarily directly improve entrepreneurship skills.

Therefore, **A** is the most direct and accurate answer based on the information provided in the text.
"
以下哪项陈述准确描述了后现代主义学习方法？,"The correct answer is **D: 在学习中没有绝对 (There is no absolute in learning)**.

Here's why:

* **P explicitly states:** ""并没有一种学习方法是好的学习方法 (There is no one good way to learn)."" This directly supports the idea that there are no absolutes in learning.
* **The passage generally:** Advocates for a learning style with which any learning style is not better than the other, thereby stating that there is not any absolute best in learning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 某些学习经验比其他经验更有益 (Some learning experiences are more beneficial than others)** - This contradicts the core idea of the passage, which argues *against* the idea that any learning method is superior.
* **B: 学习应集中于我们认为自己会经历的事情 (Learning should focus on things we think we will experience)** - The passage discusses passive learning from TV, not active learning based on anticipated experiences.
* **C: 某些学习方式比其他方式更好 (Some ways of learning are better than others)** - This again directly contradicts the statement ""并没有一种学习方法是好的学习方法 (There is no one good way to learn).""

Therefore, option D is the only one that accurately reflects the post-modern learning approach described in the passage.
"
以下哪项陈述没有准确反映后现代主义学习方法？,"The passage argues against prioritizing certain learning experiences and suggests that learning happens simply through exposure, even without application. Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: 有很多学习信息的方式 (There are many ways to learn information)** - This aligns with the postmodernist idea that there isn't *one* correct way to learn, implying multiple avenues are valid. The passage implies this by showcasing that many people gain knowledge by just watching TV shows.

*   **B: 应优先考虑某些学习经验 (Certain learning experiences should be prioritized)** - This directly contradicts the passage's assertion that no learning method is better than another and that nothing needs to be specifically learned. The passage suggests all experience, even vicarious experience by watching TV, brings learning.

*   **C: 学习经验依赖于学习者和所呈现的知识 (Learning experiences depend on the learner and the knowledge presented)** - The passage implies this by suggesting that learning happens when the learner experiences the knowledge presented.

*   **D: 我们可能永远不会应用的知识仍然值得学习 (Knowledge we may never apply is still worth learning)** - The passage suggests this by indicating that learning occurs even when we watch TV shows, but never participate or apply such knowledge.

Therefore, the statement that *doesn't* accurately reflect the postmodernist learning approach as described in the passage is **B**.
"
在正常睡眠期间有意地醒来后，哪些会干扰睡眠中断过程？,"The correct answer is **A: 在重新入睡前阅读一个半小时**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage defines sleep interruption as waking up intentionally during normal sleep and falling back asleep after a short period (10-60 minutes).**

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: 在重新入睡前阅读一个半小时 (Reading for an hour and a half before falling back asleep):** This exceeds the 10-60 minute window specified for sleep interruption. It is therefore, an interference with the Sleep Interruption process.
*   **B: 上厕所并立即回到床上 (Going to the bathroom and immediately returning to bed):** This aligns with the method suggested in the passage to use the need to urinate as a means of waking up during sleep.
*   **C: 关闭床头柜上的闹钟，二十分钟后重新入睡 (Turning off the alarm on the nightstand and falling back asleep after twenty minutes):** This is within the recommended timeframe.
*   **D: 起床从床头柜上的瓶子里喝水 (Getting up and drinking water from a bottle on the nightstand):** This is a short activity and does not interfere with the sleep interruption.

Therefore, **A** clearly violates the time constraint for a sleep interruption and would interfere with the process."
以下哪项不是关于睡眠中断的准确描述？,"The passage states that after waking up during sleep interruption, the goal is to fall back asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes). Option D states the goal is to fall back asleep within two hours. This contradicts the passage.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: 醒来后，目标是在两个小时内重新入睡**.
"
当大脑更频繁地做清醒梦时，会增加哪个方面？,"The correct answer is **D: 快速眼动状态之间的时间间隔**.

The passage states: ""造成这种现象的主要原因是清晰的梦境延长了快速眼动状态之间的时间间隔.""  This directly links frequent lucid dreaming to increased time intervals between REM cycles.
"
频繁做清醒梦可能对身体产生以下哪种负面影响？,"根据P的描述，清晰的梦境延长了快速眼动状态之间的时间间隔，并且每晚快速眼动的次数减少，因此正确答案是 B: 每晚快速眼动的次数减少。
"
根据这段文字，传统团队和虚拟团队有什么相似之处？,"The correct answer is **A: 两种团队预计有同等水平的工作表现 (Both teams are expected to have the same level of work performance)**.

The passage states: ""虚拟团队需要坚持与传统团队同样的质量标准 (Virtual teams need to adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams)."" This directly implies that both types of teams are held to the same standard of work performance/quality.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 两种团队在日常工作中都有不同程度的自主权 (Both teams have varying degrees of autonomy in their daily work):** The passage states virtual teams *often* have *more* autonomy. This doesn't mean traditional teams also have autonomy or that both teams have varying degrees.
*   **C: 两种团队都向隐形的管理团队汇报 (Both teams report to an invisible management team):** The passage mentions ""invisible team"" (management team) only in the context of virtual teams.
*   **D: 两种团队都在同一时区运作 (Both teams operate in the same time zone):** The passage suggests the opposite, stating that virtual teams *may* have team members in different time zones.

"
根据这段文字，关于实体团队和虚拟团队的陈述中哪个不正确？,"The correct answer is **A: 传统团队通常被要求达到更高的标准**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Virtual teams need to adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, *but with nuances*.  This means the standards are generally the same, not that traditional teams have *higher* standards.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: 虚拟团队经常充当传统团队的接洽点:** This is directly stated in the text: ""Virtual team members often serve as points of contact for their corresponding offline teams.""
* **C: 传统团队比虚拟团队拥有的自主权更少:**  The text mentions that virtual teams often have *more* autonomy: ""They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams may schedule meeting times around different time zones, which local management may not understand.""
* **D: 不同的时区可以使虚拟团队受益:** The passage implies this. The reason virtual teams have more autonomy is *because* of the different time zones they operate in. This implies a benefit in scheduling flexibility.
"
以下哪项不是内容理论的核心？,"The correct answer is **A: 在成年后显现的新欲望 (New desires that emerge in adulthood)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** Content theories focus on needs and desires that are *internalized* by the time people reach adulthood. This implies that the focus is on pre-existing, developed needs, not new ones that suddenly appear.

The other options are directly supported by the passage:

*   **B: 环境如何影响人们的行为 (How the environment affects people's behavior)**: The passage mentions ""what things in their environment make them do or not do certain things.""
*   **C: 被内化的需求 (Internalized needs)**: The passage explicitly states that ""certain needs and/or desires become internalized"" as people mature.
*   **D: 理解人们的喜好 (Understanding people's preferences)**: The passage speaks of identifying factors that people identify with or find interesting. It focuses on preferences.

Therefore, option A goes against the information provided in the passage about content theories."
以下哪项不是三分法的对象？,"The passage describes the rule of thirds as a guideline that helps:

*   Determine effective placement of the subject (matching option A and C)
*   Create dynamism (matching option B)
*   Maintain order in the image (matching option D)

All of the options provided are part of the Rule of Thirds. So, the answer is **none of the above**. I believe there is an error in the question as it does not provide an option that would not be true."
以下哪个选项没有描述 35mm 摄影格式？,"The answer is **C: 它具有与许多常见格式不同的宽高比**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""许多常见格式（例如 APS 格式系列）都与这个长宽比相同或相当接近""，meaning it is not different.

The other options are directly mentioned as characteristics of 35mm format:

*   A: ""时至今日仍有生产"" (It is still in production)
*   B: ""它的长宽比应用到了数码相机图像传感器的格式上"" (It is adopted by digital camera formats)
*   D: ""世界上最常见的静态图像摄影格式是 35mm 格式"" (It is the most common format)"
根据这段文字，随着制造商提高镜头生产质量，变焦镜头如何得到改进？,"The correct answer is **C: 它们的照片质量与固定焦距镜头相似**.

The passage states: ""随着镜头制造商在镜头生产方面达到更高的标准，这已经不算什么问题了。 这使得变焦镜头可以拍出与固定焦距镜头质量相媲美的照片。"" This directly addresses how improved manufacturing leads to zoom lenses producing image quality comparable to prime (fixed focal length) lenses.
"
根据文中提供的信息，什么情况下变焦镜头比定焦镜头更可取？,"The correct answer is **D: 如果你想要更高的焦距复杂度**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that zoom lenses require higher focal complexity to achieve a certain focal range. Therefore, someone who wants high focal complexity would prefer a zoom lens.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 如果最大光圈很高是优先考虑因素:** The passage states that zoom lenses usually have *smaller* maximum apertures than prime lenses, making this incorrect.
*   **B: 如果你想使用更少的透镜元件:** The passage says zoom lenses need *more* lens elements, so this is incorrect.
*   **C: 如果你不想在较暗的环境中使用闪光灯:** The passage implies that zoom lenses with smaller maximum apertures struggle in low light without a flash, making this incorrect."
下列哪项不是对神秘主义的准确描述？,"The correct answer is **D: 强调寻求个人直接体验，与许多其他形式的宗教信仰和崇拜相当**.

Here's why:

* The passage *explicitly* states that mysticism can be distinguished from other forms of religious belief and worship because it emphasizes personal direct experience. Option D says the opposite - that it's comparable to other forms of religion.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不是神秘主义的关注重点？,"The correct answer is **B: 通过共享的共有体验来追求洞见**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 追求对神圣的现实的直觉** - The passage explicitly states that mystics seek ""a direct experience, intuition or insight of sacred reality/divinity or God(s).""
*   **C: 强调幸福的意识状态** - The passage states that mysticism emphasizes ""personal direct experiences of altered states of consciousness, especially those of a peaceful, insightful, blissful or even ecstatic nature.""
*   **D: 追求对上帝的知觉意识** - The passage states that mysticism seeks ""to communicate with, identify with, or attain awareness of ultimate reality, divinity, spiritual truth, or God.""
*   **B: 通过共享的共有体验来追求洞见** - The passage emphasizes *个人*的直接体验，而不是共享的体验。

Therefore, option B is the only option that is not mentioned in the passage as a focus of mysticism."
根据这段文章，谁可能开创了一个农业社会？,"The passage states that the theory established the idea that ""Māori migrated from Polynesia in 'Great Fleet' and seized New Zealand from the Moriori, *establishing an agricultural society*.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **C: 来自波利尼西亚的毛利人** (Māori from Polynesia)"
根据这段文字，猎取恐鸟的群体是哪个地方的最早居民？,"The passage states that for a long time it was thought that the first inhabitants of **New Zealand** were the Maori, who hunted the moa.

Therefore, the answer is **B: New Zealand**.
"
在哪种情况下，使用净土折纸方法会使折纸人受益？,"根据原文，净土折纸的目的是帮助缺乏经验的折纸人或动手能力差的人。

*   **A: 折纸人喜欢一次性进行多次折叠** - 这与净土折纸一次只能折叠一次的规则相悖。
*   **B: 折纸人具有高超的动手能力** - 净土折纸适合动手能力差的人。
*   **C: 折纸人正在创作需要反向折叠的折纸作品** - 净土折纸不允许反向折叠。
*   **D: 折纸人之前只尝试过一两次** - 这与净土折纸帮助缺乏经验的折纸人的目的相符。

因此，正确答案是 **D**。
"
以下哪项不准确地描述了净土折纸？,"The correct answer is **A: It is suitable for experienced origami artists.**

The passage states that Pureland origami was developed to help *inexperienced* origami artists or those with poor dexterity. Therefore, saying it is suitable for *experienced* artists is inaccurate and contradicts the text. The other options accurately reflect information in the passage.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪个地点与印度河流域文明无关？,"正确答案是 **C: 阿富汗东北部所有地区**

这段文字明确指出印度河流域文明覆盖了“阿富汗东北部的一些地区”，而 C 选项表述的是“阿富汗东北部所有地区”，这意味着它可能包含了文明未曾触及的区域，所以与印度河流域文明无关。其他选项都直接出现在原文中，是印度河流域文明的一部分。
"
以下哪个不是在文章中提到的青铜时代文明的可能名称？,"The question asks which of the options is *not* a possible name for the Bronze Age civilization mentioned in the passage.

*   **A: 哈拉帕文明 (Harappan Civilization)** - The passage mentions that some people call it the ""Harappan civilization"" after the first excavated site.
*   **B: 印度河-萨拉斯瓦蒂河文明 (Indus-Saraswati Civilization)** - The passage mentions that some scholars propose the name ""Indus-Saraswati Civilization"".
*   **C: 印度河文明 (Indus Civilization)** - The passage refers to the ""Indus River basin"" and how the civilization got its name. Although the exact term ""Indus Civilization"" isn't explicitly used, it's a very reasonable inference based on ""Indus River basin"".
*   **D: 印度河流域文明 (Indus Valley Civilization)** - The passage explicitly states that the civilization is the ""Indus Valley Civilization"".

Therefore, all the provided options are indeed the civilization's potential names. There must be something wrong with the question or choices provided. I assumed the question asks which name is most closely associated with the civilization described in the paragraph, the answer should be **C: 印度河文明** since it only refers to Indus river and not the valley.

However, without changes, I cannot determine the correct answer since all options are likely names.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪个能够获得长远利益？,"The correct answer is **A: 与他人合作 (Cooperating with others)**.

The passage explicitly states that ""从长远来看，与他人合作才是最佳选择 (in the long run, cooperating with others is the best choice)."" The other options contradict the passage's main point.
"
根据这段文字，如果某人关注于即时利益，他们可能会优先考虑以下哪个？,"The correct answer is **D: 自私**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""short-term selfish behavior always yields more benefits when the majority benefits.""
*   The question asks what someone focused on immediate gains would prioritize.
*   Therefore, someone looking for immediate benefit would choose 自私 (selfishness), since that's the path to short-term gains."
根据这段文字，谁支付了战争开支的重要部分？,"The correct answer is **D: 菲律宾人民**.

The passage states: ""他们被迫向美国殖民政权纳税，用于支付大部分开支，以及通过华尔街银行以菲律宾政府名义发行的债券的利息."" This clearly indicates that the Filipino people were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime, which were used to cover a significant portion of the war expenses.
"
哪个时期在圣殿骑士时代之前？,"The correct answer is **C: 中世纪早期** (Early Middle Ages).

The passage states that the High Middle Ages (the time of the Knights Templar) was preceded by the Early Middle Ages.
"
哪个时期在圣殿骑士时代之后？,"The correct answer is A: 中世纪晚期.

The passage states ""中世纪盛期之后是中世纪晚期"". Since the Knights Templar existed during the High Middle Ages, the Late Middle Ages followed the era of the Knights Templar.
"
文中未提及罗马帝国时期被医生和外科医生使用的哪种医疗治疗或手术？,"The correct answer is **A: 用各种镇静剂治疗创伤后应激障碍**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions鎮靜劑s like morphine and scopolamine being used, but it doesn't specifically say they were used to treat *创伤后应激障碍*. It only mentions them in the context of general surgical procedures and pain management.
*   Options B, C, and D are all explicitly mentioned in the passage."
根据这段文字，以下哪个不是归功于罗马帝国医学领域的进步？,"正确答案是 **C: 学习型医院的创建**

解释：

*   **A: 医疗队的组建** 文中明确提到奥古斯都皇帝组建了第一支罗马医疗队。
*   **B: 帝国的侵略性军事政策** 文中指出罗马帝国的军国主义性质促进了医学的进步，这表明侵略性军事政策对医学发展有贡献。
*   **D: 皇帝对医生的招募** 文中明确提到奥古斯都皇帝开始招募医生。
*   **C: 学习型医院的创建** 文中没有提到罗马帝国创建学习型医院。

因此，选项C是不符合原文内容的。"
视觉依赖于什么？,"The best answer is **A: 视觉系统感觉器官**.

The passage explicitly states that ""视觉或看的能力依赖于视觉系统的感觉器官，即眼睛."" While the other options are mentioned as factors related to vision, they are not the *primary* dependency.
"
生物体之间眼睛结构的变化取决于什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 生物体的需要**.

The passage explicitly states: ""眼睛的构造有许多种，其复杂程度取决于生物体的需要."" (The construction of eyes comes in many forms, and their complexity depends on the needs of the organism.)

While the other options are related to eye structure and function, the passage directly links eye structure variations to the needs of the organism. Therefore, B is the most direct and accurate answer.
"
根据这段文字，哪个关于锡克教的描述没有准确描绘这个宗教？,"The correct answer is **B: 古鲁是锡克教特有的基本组成部分**

Here's why:

*   **A: 锡克教是印度教传统内部分裂的结果** - The passage states ""...来自印度教传统的内部宗派分裂."" This accurately describes the origins of Sikhism.

*   **B: 古鲁是锡克教特有的基本组成部分** - The passage says, ""古鲁是所有印度宗教的基本组成部分，但在锡克教中地位特别高，成为了锡克教信仰的核心"". This statement indicates that the concept of Guru is not unique to Sikhism.

*   **C: 在这个宗教的创始人古鲁·纳纳克之后，有九位古鲁** - The passage explicitly states ""该宗教于 15 世纪由古鲁·纳纳克 (1469-1539) 创立。随后又有九位古鲁.""

*   **D: 锡克教的某些传统根植于印度教** - The passage states ""...他们承认锡克教源自印度教，也包含印度教的传统."" This accurately reflects the relationship between the two religions."
根据这段文字，以下哪个是被认为是锡克教信仰体系的核心方面？,"The correct answer is **A: 古鲁的概念**.

The passage states: ""古鲁是所有印度宗教的基本组成部分，但在锡克教中地位特别高，成为了锡克教信仰的核心。"" (Gurus are a fundamental part of all Indian religions, but their status is particularly high in Sikhism, becoming the core of Sikh belief.)

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: 印度教传统:** While Sikhism originated from Hindu traditions, the passage emphasizes Sikhism's distinctness.
*   **C: 拒绝承认其他印度宗教:** The passage does not mention refusing to acknowledge other Indian religions. It states that Sikhism considers itself distinct from Hinduism, but not necessarily rejecting it.
*   **D: 说旁遮普语:** While Sikhism originated in Punjab and uses Punjabi, speaking Punjabi is not identified as a core aspect of the belief system itself.
"
根据这段文章，患有注意力缺失症的孩子可能很难专心做什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 学校作业**.

The passage states: ""患有多动症的孩子很难专心做事，例如做作业..."" (Children with ADHD have difficulty concentrating on things, such as doing homework...).
"
根据这段文章，为什么患有注意力缺失症的孩子往往会从事冒险行为？,"The correct answer is **D: 为了刺激他们的大脑**.

The passage states: ""因为正常的方法无法刺激他们的大脑，为了刺激大脑，他们“做出危险行为、打架、挑战权威”."" This directly links risky behavior to the need for stimulation.
"
根据这段文字中的信息，哪个不是支架式教学的例子？,"The passage describes scaffolding as a form of assistance for someone learning something new. It can be online or in person, and its purpose is to guide the learner through challenges they might not be able to handle alone.

Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: 一个电脑游戏开始时的教程** This fits the description of scaffolding. It's built into the software to guide a new user.
*   **B: SAT辅导员** A tutor provides personalized guidance and support to help a student improve their SAT score. This is clearly an example of scaffolding.
*   **C: 一个独立学习计划** This does **not** fit the description of scaffolding. An independent study plan implies learning alone, without direct assistance.
*   **D: 一个小型联盟教练** A little league coach provides guidance, instruction, and support to young players. This is an example of scaffolding.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 一个独立学习计划**."
以下哪个没有准确描述支架式教学的概念？,"The correct answer is **C: It is also known as project-based learning**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly contrasts scaffolding with project-based learning.
*   The passage indicates scaffolding is not a learning method itself, but a tool to support learning.
*   The other options are all mentioned in the passage as characteristics of scaffolding."
根据这段文字，MySpace 的哪项功能可以让阅读有困难的学生受益？,"The correct answer is **A: 个性化设置**.

The passage states ""It can be personalized to make it easier to read, using more or less color as needed."" This directly addresses the needs of students who have difficulty reading.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不是赫鲁晓夫对工人暴动的回应的一部分？,"The passage states:

*   赫鲁晓夫派出坦克恢复了秩序 (B)
*   他对一些经济要求做出了让步 (D)
*   同意任命受民众欢迎的瓦迪斯瓦夫·哥穆尔卡 (Wladyslaw Gomulka) 为新总理 (A)

The passage doesn't mention anything about increasing wage cuts; it says the workers were protesting wage cuts. Therefore, the correct answer is C.
"
以下哪项不是波兰骚乱的原因之一？,"The correct answer is **D: Appointing Wladyslaw Gomulka**.

The passage states that Gomulka was appointed *after* the riots, as a concession. The riots were triggered by food shortages and pay cuts, and fueled by opposition to the communist system. Therefore, Gomulka's appointment could not have been a *cause* of the riots.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项没有影响到苏联和美国之间的关系？,"The correct answer is **B: 对德国的看法 (Opinions about Germany)**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 文化差异 (Cultural differences):** The passage explicitly states that ""制度、程序和文化上的冲突又使得两国分道扬镳 (conflicts in systems, procedures, and culture separated the two countries).""
*   **C: 相反的进程 (Opposite processes):** This alludes to the divergent systems and ideologies (e.g., communism vs. capitalism) that drove the two nations apart.
*   **D: 关于制度的争议 (Disputes about systems):** As noted above, the passage explicitly mentions disagreements over systems contributed to their split.

The passage says that *shared* views of Germany (as a common enemy) *brought* the US and USSR together. Thus, varying views of Germany would be part of that process, rather than an element that didn't influence the relationship. With the *end* of Germany as a *shared* enemy, the relationship was impacted and became hostile.
"
以下哪项不能准确描述神经脉冲在全身传送的目的？,"The passage states the nervous system maintains homeostasis by keeping blood flowing smoothly through nerve impulses. It also says these impulses protect the body from threats.

*   **A: 减缓血液流动 (Slow down blood flow)** - The passage says nerve impulses keep blood flowing *smoothly*, implying regulation, not necessarily slowing it down. In fact, in some situations (like a fight-or-flight response), nerve impulses would *increase* blood flow to muscles.
*   **B: 管理血液流动 (Manage blood flow)** - This aligns with keeping blood flowing smoothly.
*   **C: 维持体内平衡 (Maintain homeostasis)** - This is directly stated in the passage.
*   **D: 让身体免受潜在威胁 (Protect the body from potential threats)** - This is also directly stated in the passage.

Therefore, the answer that is NOT an accurate description of the purpose of nerve impulses is **A: 减缓血液流动 (Slow down blood flow)**.
"
在吉萨高原上可以发现什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 坟墓**, **B: 庙宇**, and **D: 大金字塔**.

The passage states that the Giza plateau includes ""多个金字塔（其中大金字塔是最大的）, 几个小坟墓，几个寺庙和大狮身人面像"".

Option C is incorrect because only one of the Seven Wonders (the Great Pyramid) is located on the Giza Plateau.
"
大金字塔的目的是什么？,"The passage states: ""大金字塔是埃及人在公元前三世纪的杰作，它是众多向已故法老表示敬意的大型金字塔的其中之一。"" and ""大金字塔是为纪念胡夫法老而建造的，并为纪念胡夫的妻子和家庭成员建造了多座较小的金字塔、坟墓和庙宇.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: 为了向法老表示敬意**.
"
我们对于摧毁神庙的纵火犯的认知来源于谁？,"The correct answer is **C: 斯特拉博 (Strabo)**.

The passage states that ""希腊历史学家斯特拉博 (Strabo) 后来提到了这个名字，也就是我们今天所熟知的名字."" This directly implies that our knowledge of Herostratus's name (and therefore, our knowledge of the arsonist) comes from Strabo.
"
关于阿尔忒弥斯神庙的重建，哪项陈述是准确的？,"The correct answer is **B: It was rebuilt after Alexander the Great's reign.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Alexander offered to rebuild the temple but was refused.
*   It further states that the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC after Alexander's death.

Therefore, option B is the only accurate statement according to the text."
根据这段文字，一个物种可能最早用双腿行走是在什么时候？,"The correct answer is **A: 700 万年前**.

The text states that ""乍得沙赫人（Sahelanthropus）可能早在 700 万年前就已经用双腿行走了"".
"
以下哪个物种经常用两只脚行走？,"The correct answer is **B: 直立人**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""2 million years ago, with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man), humans began to walk upright."" This directly links Homo Erectus (直立人) to upright walking.
*   While the passage mentions other hominids also walked on two legs, only 直立人 began to walk upright.
*   选项 A和D提到了其他的 hominids 也在使用两只脚走路，但是只有选项 B 提到了直立行走。
*   选项C是说明双足的特征，而不是一个物种。
"
二战期间德国海军想要实现什么目标？,"The correct answer is **B: 防止英国接收人员和货物**.

The passage states that ""以 U 型潜艇为主力的德国海军试图拦截这场运输 [美国人尝试横跨大西洋运送人员和物资来帮助英国]."" This means the German navy was trying to stop the UK from receiving people and supplies.
"
根据文中的信息，在北大西洋战役期间，谁在海战中取得了最大的成功？,"The passage states that the Germans were trying to intercept the Allied shipments. It also implies that if the Allies had failed, Germany would have likely conquered Britain. This suggests the Allies (Americans and British) were ultimately successful in their efforts, even if it was a difficult struggle.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: 英国人和美国人**.
"
当亚述人开始使用骑兵时，以下哪个是不存在的？,"The passage states:

*   亚述人使用了第一批骑兵。当时尚未发明马鞍，因此亚述骑兵只能骑在光秃秃的马背上作战 (The Assyrians used the first cavalry. Saddles had not yet been invented at the time, so the Assyrian cavalry could only fight on bareback horses).

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: 马鞍 (Saddles)**.
"
使用骑兵的战斗通常是如何进行的？,"The correct answer is **C: 骑马 (Riding)**.

The passage explicitly states that ""骑兵是指在马背上作战的军队 (Cavalry refers to armies that fight on horseback)."" Therefore, fighting on horseback is the defining characteristic of cavalry.
"
根据这段文字，普通的巴比伦人不可能出现在哪里？,"The correct answer is **D: 在内殿里献祭** (In the inner temple to sacrifice).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the **inner temple** was accessible **only to priests**. This means ordinary Babylonians would not be allowed inside.
*   The passage states that the **outer courtyard** was open to the public.
*   Therefore, ordinary people could attend **ceremonies and festivals** held in the temple courtyards and offer sacrifices there.

Therefore, options A, B, and C are incorrect."
以下哪项是专门为祭司准备的？,"The correct answer is **B: 内殿**.

The passage states: ""每所神殿都有一处对外开放的庭院，以及一处只有祭司才能进入的内殿 (Each temple had an outer court open to the public, and an inner shrine accessible only to priests).""  The other options are not specifically restricted to priests in the passage.
"
图坦卡蒙国王何时引起了轰动？,"The correct answer is **C: 在他的坟墓被发现之后 (After his tomb was discovered)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""然而，1922 年发现了他的墓穴，让他成了名人 (However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a celebrity).""
"
是什么使图坦卡蒙国王成为著名的埃及国王之一？,"The correct answer is **A: 他的未遭破坏的坟墓被发现**.

The passage explicitly states that Tutankhamun's fame is due to the discovery of his nearly intact tomb in 1922. The passage also contradicts the other options:

*   **B** The passage states that he was not listed on most ancient king lists, indicating he didn't have a high standing.
*   **C** The passage states that his tomb was mostly intact, meaning it *wasn't* robbed of thousands of artifacts.
*   **D** The passage says he wasn't considered important in ancient times."
希腊诗人荷马无法做什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 看 (See)**.

The passage states that Homer was a ""传奇色彩的盲人诗人"" (legendary blind poet), meaning he was blind.
"
以下哪个著名的希腊人以其他方面而不是文学而闻名？,"The passage states:

*   **荷马 (Homer):** Poet, author of *Iliad* and *Odyssey* (Literature)
*   **索福克勒斯 (Sophocles):** Playwright (Literature)
*   **阿里斯托芬 (Aristophanes):** Playwright (Literature)
*   **毕达哥拉斯 (Pythagoras):** Mathematician (Mathematics)

The question asks for the famous Greek person known for something *other* than literature.

*   **索福克勒斯 (Sophocles)**, **荷马 (Homer)** and **阿里斯托芬 (Aristophanes)** are all associated with literature.
*   **毕达哥拉斯 (Pythagoras)** is associated with mathematics.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 毕达哥拉斯 (Pythagoras)**."
希伯来家庭经常在哪里度过大部分时间？,"The passage states ""希伯来家庭的生活大多是在户外度过的。女人们在院子里做饭..."", which translates to ""Hebrew families spent most of their lives outdoors. The women cooked in the courtyard..."". This indicates that both outdoors and courtyard are correct in some sense, but the courtyard is a *specific* outdoor location mentioned. Since the question asks where they spend **most** of their time, and the passage emphasizes outdoor living, the best answer is A, but C is also acceptable.

However, since **C: 在院子里** (In the courtyard) is a *specific* place mentioned in the passage (women cooking in the courtyard), it is a **more direct and accurate answer** than A.

Therefore, the best answer is **C**.
"
希伯来家庭认为什么不是很重要的？,"The correct answer is **C: 他们的房子 (Their houses)**.

*   **A: 它们的行为类似于狗群:** 原文说狮群的行为与狼群或狗群非常类似，所以A是准确描述。
*   **B: 雄性与雌性的比例不均:** 原文说狮群由一到三只雄性和多达三十只雌性组成，所以B是准确描述。
*   **C: 雄性和雌性都有密切关系:** 原文只提到雌性之间关系密切，没有说雄性和雌性之间有密切关系，只说了雄性之间有亲属关系，所以C是不准确描述。
*   **D: 它们既致命又具有群居属性:** 原文说它们的行为对猎物来说非常致命，且是群居动物，所以D是准确描述。

因此，答案是 **C**。
"
以下哪项陈述没有准确地描述狮子的行为？,"The passage states:

*   Lions are the most social of all cats. (A is accurate)
*   Lion behavior is very similar to wolves. (B is accurate)
*   This behavior is deadly to prey. (Implying both males and females, who hunt together, are deadly, so C is likely accurate, although a slight interpretation is needed)

"
以下哪项不是豹猫的捕食方法之一？,"The correct answer is **D: 只捕食体型较小的动物**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 融入到周围环境中** is directly stated in the passage: ""豹猫的捕食方式是先融入周围环境"".
*   **B: 追踪猎物的气味** is directly stated in the passage: ""美洲豹猫是通过气味和嗅探猎物在地面上的踪迹来跟踪和寻找要捕食的动物的"".
*   **C: 在夜间追踪猎物** is implied. The passage states ""它们的夜视能力很强，能在黑暗中看得很清楚"", indicating that they hunt at night.
*   **D: 只捕食体型较小的动物** is true of their prey, but it is not necessarily a *method* or *technique* of hunting. The other options are active hunting behaviors.

"
以下哪项没有准确地描述豹猫？ ,"The correct answer is **C: 它们嗅觉较弱 (They have a weak sense of smell)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""科学家认为，美洲豹猫是通过气味和嗅探猎物在地面上的踪迹来跟踪和寻找要捕食的动物的 (Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to prey on by smelling and sniffing prey tracks on the ground)."" This clearly indicates they have a *strong* sense of smell, not a weak one.

*   The passage also supports the other options:

    *   A: ""它们的夜视能力很强，能在黑暗中看得很清楚 (They have strong night vision and can see clearly in the dark)"" implies they are good at night hunting.
    *   B: ""而且行动也很隐秘 (And they are very secretive in their actions)"" means they are stealthy.
    *   D: ""豹猫喜欢吃小动物 (Leopard cats like to eat small animals)"" and ""豹猫的猎物几乎都比自身要小得多 (Almost all of the leopard cat's prey is much smaller than itself)"" confirms they prey on small animals."
以下哪项不被认为是老虎的最大优势？,"The correct answer is **A: 咆哮**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that tigers are good at climbing, jumping, and have incredible strength (拉力).
*   The passage mentions that the tiger's roar is not as deep as a lion's. This suggests that roaring is not a primary strength, but rather a characteristic they share with other big cats.
"
根据这段文字，老虎和狮子之间有什么区别？,"The correct answer is **B: 它们咆哮的声音**.

The passage states: ""老虎的咆哮不像狮子的咆哮那样深沉，而更像一句生气嘶吼的话语."" This directly highlights a difference in the sound of their roars. The other options are incorrect because the passage does not directly compare their swimming ability, jumping distance, or pulling strength.
"
根据这段文字，罗伯特·胡克在其他生物学家之前做了什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 观察死亡细胞**.

The passage explicitly states: ""他是第一个观察死亡细胞的人 (He was the first to observe dead cells)."" While he also observed ""small squares"" (C), the question asks what he did *before* other biologists, and the passage only highlights the dead cells.

The passage states: ""Cell（细胞）一词源自拉丁语cella（意思是小房间）.""
"
根据这段文字，大多数动物都具有什么能力？,"The correct answer is **B: 移动**.

The passage states: ""大部分动物都能移动."" This directly supports the answer. While the passage mentions animals doing things like swimming, flying, and digging, it doesn't say that *most* animals do these things, only that some do.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项是某些动物所没有的？,"The passage states: ""只有动物有脑（但也不是所有动物都有，比如水母就没有脑）"". This means some animals do not have a brain.

The passage also states:
*   ""动物由许多细胞组成"" - all animals have cells.
*   ""动物吃了食物后会在体内将其消化"" - all animals have the ability to digest food.
*   The ability to eat food is implied by the digestion statement.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 脑**.

"
根据这段文字，以下哪个例子会阻碍进化过程？,"The correct answer is **A: 一个小种群在新环境中无法生存 (A small population cannot survive in a new environment).**

Here's why:

*   The passage describes speciation as a process where a small, isolated population adapts to a new environment over time, eventually becoming a distinct species.
*   **A: 一个小种群在新环境中无法生存 (A small population cannot survive in a new environment)**: If the small population dies out, there's no opportunity for adaptation, divergence, and ultimately, speciation to occur. This directly hinders the evolutionary process described.

Let's examine the other options:

*   **B: 部分种群移居到新环境 (Part of the population migrates to a new environment)**: This is the *start* of the speciation process, as described in the passage.
*   **C: 种群在新环境中调整其适应能力 (The population adjusts its adaptability in a new environment)**: This is the *mechanism* of evolution and speciation.
*   **D: 一个种群最终分裂成两个 (A population eventually splits into two)**: This is the *result* of the speciation process.

Therefore, only option A prevents the initial conditions needed for the described evolutionary process (物种形成) to start."
以下哪项陈述没有准确描述物种形成的过程？ ,"The correct answer is **A: 当一个新的种群无法适应时，就会发生这种情况 (When a new population is unable to adapt, this is what happens)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes speciation as occurring when a new population *does* adapt to a new environment. It's the *adaptation* that drives the divergence and eventual formation of a new species. If a population fails to adapt, it will likely go extinct, not speciate.

The other options are all accurate descriptions of speciation based on the passage:

*   **B: 它是进化过程中的重要方面 (It is an important aspect of the evolutionary process)** - The passage explicitly states this.
*   **C: 它指的是新物种的形成 (It refers to the formation of new species)** - This is the definition of speciation.
*   **D: 它的发生是不可避免的 (Its occurrence is inevitable)** - The passage states that speciation is a necessary result of evolution."
循环系统的哪一部分将血液带回心脏？,"The correct answer is **D: 静脉**

The passage clearly states: ""血液通过被称为动脉的管道从心脏流出，然后通过称为静脉的管道回流到心脏.""

The passage states that folding wings allows insects to fit into smaller spaces to avoid predators, which directly translates to increased hiding space.
"
文章中没有提到以下哪一项会受到昆虫飞行能力的影响？,"The correct answer is **B: 寿命 (lifespan)**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 繁殖 (reproduction):** The passage explicitly states that flight allows insects to more effectively find mates, which directly relates to reproduction.
*   **C: 采集食物 (gathering food):** The passage explicitly states that flight allows insects to more effectively find food.
*   **D: 效率 (efficiency):** Although not explicitly stated, finding food and mates more effectively implies greater efficiency in those tasks.
*   **B: 寿命 (lifespan):** The passage mentions that flight allows insects to avoid predators, which would logically increase their lifespan. However, the question asks about something *not* mentioned in the text. The text does not mention how lifespan, in itself, is directly affected by the ability to fly. While it's a reasonable inference, the question asks what is *not* explicitly stated.

Therefore, the answer is B."
以下哪个特征通常不与恐龙相关联？,"The passage explicitly states that dinosaurs walked on two hind legs, laid eggs, and had claws on their feet. The passage also mentions that people think birds are not dinosaurs *because* they have feathers. Therefore, feathers are the characteristic not usually associated with dinosaurs.

The correct answer is **B: 羽毛 (Feathers)**
"
以下哪项不常被认为是鸟类和恐龙的共同特征？,"根据文章，鸟类和恐龙的共同特征包括：

*   脚上有鳞片和爪子
*   产卵
*   用两条后腿走路

文章特别指出“很多人认为它们并非恐龙，因为它们有羽毛，会飞”，所以飞行能力是鸟类的一个特征，但不是普遍认为的恐龙的特征。

因此，答案是 C: 飞行能力
"
根据这段文字，三角龙可能会吃苏铁植物的哪一部分？,"The passage states: ""在吃树干之前，三角龙会用它强有力的喙嘴剥去树叶."" This means the leaves were removed before the trunk was eaten. The passage also mentions scientists believe Triceratops ate cycads and then describes the cycad's ""crown of nail-like sharp leaves."" This all points to the trunk being consumed. However, the question asks which part Triceratops *might* eat, acknowledging uncertainty due to the toxicity debate. While the primary focus is on the trunk after removing the leaves, it's possible they ate the leaves too, even if scientists debate the likelihood.

Considering the debate about toxicity, the safer answer, based directly on the text describing the plant, is the **树干 (tree trunk)**. The passage explicitly mentions they would strip the leaves and *then* eat the trunk. While the debate is ongoing, the act of stripping the leaves suggests that the trunk might be their target. The passage doesn't mention the other parts of the plant as part of their diet.

Therefore, the best answer is **B: 树干**
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项是三角龙最有可能吃的？ ,"The passage discusses two possibilities:

*   **Option 1:** Triceratops ate cycads, which are plants with tough leaves and trunks.
*   **Option 2:** Even if cycads were poisonous, Triceratops might have been able to eat them.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Sloths:** The passage mentions sloths as an example of animals that can eat poisonous plants, but doesn't suggest Triceratops ate sloths.
*   **B: Plants with hard branches:** This aligns with the description of cycads having tough leaves and the ability of Triceratops to eat tough roots and branches.
*   **C: Parrots:** The passage mentions parrots as an example of animals that can eat poisonous plants, but doesn't suggest Triceratops ate parrots.
*   **D: Plants with poisonous fruits:** The passage mentions the possibility of cycads being poisonous and Triceratops still eating them, but the main focus is on the tough leaves and trunks, not specifically fruits.

**Therefore, the best answer is B: Plants with hard branches.**
"

The passage states: ""哈拉帕 (Harappa) 和摩亨佐-达罗 (Mohenjo-daro) 这两个城市几乎每家每户都有抽水马桶..."" (Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house). Since the question asks about the place where *most* houses had flush toilets, and the passage explicitly mentions this for Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, and only Mohenjo-daro is listed as an answer choice, A is the only correct answer.
"
以下哪个地点发现了先进的污水处理系统？,"The passage states that Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had ""sophisticated sewage systems."" Santorini (part of the Minoan civilization) had ""remnants of sewage systems."" Egypt and China are only mentioned as having toilets.

根据这段文字，什么过程允许原子从光中消除多余的能量？,"The best answer is **D: 受激辐射**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states: ""科学家把这一过程称为“受激辐射”，因为原子受到强光的刺激，引起光子的发射"". This directly links the process of removing excess energy to ""受激辐射"".

Let's look at why the other options aren't as good:

*   **A: 辐射** - While受激辐射 is a type of 辐射, the question asks for the *specific* process by which atoms eliminate excess energy.
*   **B: 光子的受激发射**- Is very close but ""受激辐射"" refers to the overall process, where the stimulated emission of photons is a key component.
*   **C: 光子** - 光子 are the particles emitted, but they are not the *process* itself."
什么导致原子发射光子？,"The correct answer is **B: 强光的刺激**.

The passage states: ""科学家把这一过程称为“受激辐射”，因为原子受到强光的刺激，引起光子的发射...""  While releasing excess energy is the *reason* for the photon emission, the *trigger* is the stimulation by strong light.

爱沙尼亚语受到什么影响？,"The best answer is **B: 德语字母表**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Estonian written language was created using the German alphabet, with the addition of one letter. This makes the German alphabet a direct influence.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as accurate:

*   **A: 字母 Õ /õ**: While the letter ""Õ/õ"" *is* part of the Estonian alphabet, the question asks about *influences* on the language. This letter is a *result* of the German influence, not the influence itself.
*   **C: 德国修道士**: The German monks were the *agents* of the influence, not the influence itself. They were the ones who *used* the German alphabet to create the written language.
*   **D: 上帝**: God was a motivation for the monks but not a direct influence on the language itself.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer."
根据这段文字，印地语母语人口数的波动取决于哪个因素？,"The correct answer is **A: 是否计算了与印地语非常相似的方言 (Whether closely related dialects are counted)**.

*   **The passage states:** 地壳近侧厚约 70 公里，远侧厚约 100 公里. (The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km thick on the far side.)
    阴暗面下面的地壳薄一些，高地下的地壳厚一些 (The crust is thinner under the dark spots and thicker under the highlands.)
    因为地壳更薄，所以近的一面可能会有更多的阴暗部 (Because the crust is thinner, the near side likely has more dark spots)

Let's analyze the other options:

*   **A: 近侧有较厚的地壳** (The near side has a thicker crust) - The passage states the opposite; the near side has a thinner crust (70km) than the far side (100km).
*   **B: 高地下的地壳更薄** (The crust is thinner under the highlands) - The passage explicitly states the opposite; the crust is thicker under the highlands.
*   **D: 高地下的阴暗面可能更少** (The highlands likely have fewer dark spots) - The passage says because the crust is thinner on the near side, the near side probably has more dark spots. It does not compare the highlands to dark spots.

"
根据这段文字，月球哪个部分的地壳最厚？,"The text states: ""阴暗面下面的地壳薄一些，高地下的地壳厚一些 (The crust is thinner under the dark side, and thicker under the highlands).""

Therefore, the answer is **C: 在高地下 (In the highlands)**.
"

The passage states: ""有些人相信其他行星上可能有外星人或其他生命"". This directly supports option C.
"
根据这段文字，离太阳中心越远，什么会变得越薄？,"The correct answer is **C: 气体**.

The passage states: ""当你距离太阳中心越远，气体就越稀薄。"" (When you are further away from the sun's center, the gas becomes thinner.)
"
根据这段文字，太阳的哪个部分从地球可见？,"The passage states: ""我们看到的太阳外部称作光球层，意即“光之球”.""  This translates to ""The outer part of the sun that we see is called the photosphere, which means 'sphere of light'.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 光球层 (Photosphere)**.
"
以下哪项观测有助于证实哥白尼的理论？,"The passage states that ""Venus's phases supported the Copernican theory, which states that planets revolve around the Sun.""

**A: 金星的相变** (Venus's phases)
"
以下哪项是伽利略·伽利莱在 1610 年观测到的？,"The correct answer is **B: 金星的相变**.

The passage states: ""Galileo Galilei...discovered that Venus has phases like the moon. The phases occur because only the side of Venus (or the Moon) facing the Sun is lit. The phases of Venus supported the Copernican theory that the planets revolve around the Sun.""

Therefore, Galileo observed the phases of Venus.

文章中提到的哪个行业雇用的委内瑞拉人最少？,"The correct answer is **C: 石油 (Oil)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that only **1%** of Venezuelans work in the oil industry.
*   The passage states that **20%** of Venezuelans work in the agricultural industry.
*   The passage states that **25%** of Venezuelans work in the industrial industry.
*   The passage states that **66%** of Venezuelans work in the service industry.
*   Comparing these percentages, oil has the lowest employment rate."
根据这段文字，以下哪个行业雇用的委内瑞拉人最多？,"The passage states that ""三分之二的委内瑞拉人就是这样从事服务行业 (Two-thirds of Venezuelans are employed in the service sector)"". It also states that ""接近四分之一的人从事工业 (Nearly a quarter are employed in industry)"" and ""五分之一的人在农业行业里工作 (One-fifth work in agriculture)"". One percent work in the oil industry.

Since two-thirds is a larger proportion than nearly a quarter or one-fifth or one percent, the service industry employs the most Venezuelans.

So the answer is A: 服务业 (Service Industry)
"
根据这段文字，聚变使恒星能够做什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 散发光和热** (Emit light and heat).

The passage states: ""恒星会散发光和热，这是因为氢原子结合（或聚变）在一起形成更重的元素时产生了能量。"" (Stars emit light and heat because energy is produced when hydrogen atoms combine (or fuse) together to form heavier elements.)

Therefore, fusion allows stars to emit light and heat.
"

"
根据这段文字，十三个州试图实施某些法律时没有哪个问题？,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: 州政府的严格监督**.

Here's why:

*   The passage focuses on the **lack** of central government power and the states' *lack* of cooperation. It highlights the problems caused by the central government being too **weak** and dependent on the states.
*   The text explains that the states were treating the central government with ""轻慢"" which means the central government was not being tightly supervised.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **B: 国会内部的权力不足** The passage explicitly discusses the lack of power within Congress.
*   **C: 条款需要得到一致同意才能修改** The passage states that all states had to agree to any changes in the Articles of Confederation.
*   **D: 一个不存在的国家行政机构** The passage directly mentions the absence of a national executive branch.

Therefore, the ten states were **not** faced with strict supervision from state governments as they attempted to implement laws.
"
根据这段文字，哪项陈述准确反映了独立战争期间中央政府的状态？,"The correct answer is **C: 州代表缺乏存在感 (State representatives lacked presence)**.

Here's why:

*   **P states:** ""...各州对待中央政府的态度十分轻慢，以至于其州立代表经常缺席 (The states treated the central government so lightly that their state representatives were often absent).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 由国会和州政府强制征税 (Tax collection was enforced by Congress and state governments)** - P states that the Congress **did not** have the power to tax.
*   **B: 对条款的修改依赖于国会的权威 (Amendments to the Articles depended on the authority of Congress)** - P states that amendments required unanimous consent from **all states**.
*   **D: 中央政府由两个主要组成部分组成 (The central government consisted of two main parts)** - P states that Congress was its *only* part."
《独立宣言》背面的字是怎么写的？,"The correct answer is **C: 倒着写的 (倒着写的)**.

"
新加坡因以下哪项而闻名？,"The passage states that the Singapore Botanic Gardens helped the island become a ""garden city."" This directly relates to **A: 城市绿化 (City Greening)**.

"
卓锦万代兰是什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 一种花 (A type of flower)**.

"
根据这段文字，新王国时期的埃及人不太可能对吉萨金字塔的哪个特征感到惊叹？,"The correct answer is **A: Their age**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states that the New Kingdom Egyptians were ""amazed by the monuments of their predecessors that were already over a thousand years old."" This means they were aware of and impressed by the age of the Giza pyramids. The passage directly indicates they were already aware of the pyramids' age and impressed by it, not surprised by it. The other options are directly stated in the text as impressive aspects of the pyramids (size, construction) or are implicit to the fact they were pyramids (using stone).
"
根据这段文字，食草动物从哪里出发追寻雨季？,"The correct answer is **B: 北部山区 (Northern Highlands)**.

The passage states: ""每年 10 月前后，大约有 150 万只食草动物从**北部山区**出发，穿过马拉河，前往雨水充足的南部平原.""
"
根据这段文字，大约在四月份，食草动物从哪个地区出发？,"The passage states ""Then, in April around the rainy season, *they return from the west* to the north, crossing the Mara River again."" It doesn't explicitly state a region, but the best answer is one that aligns with the west. Since the passage describes a migration cycle between the northern mountains and the southern plains, with a return from the west, and no mention of Serengeti, Mara River, or Maasai Mara being where the animals *begin* their April migration, the answer that aligns with the description is:

*   **B: 南部平原**

Because the animals migrate TO the southern plains after the northern migration and then after the rainy season (around April) they head west and THEN north. This strongly suggests that the animals start from the southern plains."
海狮行动是入侵哪个国家？,"The correct answer is **B: 英国**.

The passage states that ""德国又开始为入侵不列颠岛做准备。 德国将此次袭击的代号定为“海狮行动”."" 不列颠岛 is the island of Great Britain, which is the main island of the United Kingdom.

"
在意大利夺取非洲国家的计划中，哪一项没有被提到是必要的步骤？,"The correct answer is **B: 建造额外的船舰**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 摆脱埃及的船舰:** The passage states that Italy needed to remove British ships and bases from Egypt to control the Mediterranean.
*   **C: 建立一个军队基地:** The passage explicitly states the need for a military base.
*   **D: 摧毁英国基地:** The passage refers to the need to dislodge the British from their base in Egypt.

The passage mentions that Italy had recently built ships, but it doesn't say that building more ships was a *necessary step* in their plan to take African countries. Therefore, building additional ships is not mentioned as a necessary step in their plan.
"
根据这段文字，什么被认为是意大利的主要战争目标？,"The correct answer is **A: 夺取非洲国家**.

The passage explicitly states: ""意大利的主要目标是非洲国家 (Italy's main objective was African countries)."" The other options are either steps towards this goal or incorrect.
"
谁与侵略者建立了友好关系？,"The correct answer is **B: 维希法国人**.

"
参与“龙骑兵行动”的盟军有哪些？,"The correct answer is **A: 美国人和自由法国人** because the passage states that ""American and Free French troops liberated southern France"" during Operation Dragoon.
"
是什么技术的发展使潜艇能够开始在水下航行？,"The correct answer is **D: 雷达** (Radar).

The passage states that ""随着雷达的发展和精确度的提高，潜艇被迫潜入水下以免被发现"" (With the development and increased accuracy of radar, submarines were forced to submerge to avoid being detected). This directly links the advancement of radar technology to the need for submarines to operate underwater.
"
在最初使用期间，潜艇在哪些领域的范围非常有限？,"The passage states: ""那时它们的速度很慢，射击范围也非常有限."" This directly addresses the question of limited range during early use.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 射击 (Shooting)**.

以下哪项不是红军执行的任务？,"The correct answer is **C: 在桥头堡区域进行改编**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states the _Polish_ planned to retreat and regroup at the Romanian bridgehead.** The Soviets *prevented* this by invading.
*   **A: 筑起乌克兰阵地:** The passage explicitly mentions the Red Army establishing positions in Ukraine.
*   **B: 入侵东部地区:** The passage directly states the Red Army invaded the eastern regions of Poland.
*   **D: 违反条约:** The passage mentions the Soviet Union violated multiple treaties by invading.

Therefore, the only action *not* performed by the Red Army, but rather an action intended by the Polish, is regrouping in the bridgehead area.
"

Options A, B, and D are mentioned in the context of Kundalini yoga, not specifically as core components of Tibetan meditation (Taming Yoga). Therefore, C is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
根据这段文字，在藏传佛教冥想的“核心”阶段如何激活轮穴？,"The correct answer is **B: 通过将神形象化 (By visualizing different deities)**.

The passage states: ""西藏冥想的核心活动是天瑜伽。通过把不同的神形象化，净化能量通道，激活轮穴，从而达到顿悟的境界 (The core activity of Tibetan meditation is sky yoga. By visualizing different deities, purifying energy channels, and activating chakras, the state of enlightenment is achieved).""

The text explicitly connects visualizing deities to activating chakras within the context of Tibetan meditation's core activity (sky yoga). The other options (yoga postures, mantras, and breathing exercises) are mentioned in relation to Kundalini yoga, not specifically the ""core"" of Tibetan meditation which is sky yoga.
"

The passage states: ""当晚由歌手桑朱·沙玛（Sanju Sharma）开场演出，随后是贾伊·尚卡尔·乔杜里 （Jai Shankar Choudhary）出场."" This indicates that Jai Shankar Choudhary performed after Sanju Sharma, making him the second singer.

"
根据这段文字，谁对令人不舒服的高温发表了评论？,"The correct answer is **B: 消防队长**.

The passage quotes Fire Chief Scott Kouns saying the day was ""very hot in Santa Clara, probably in the 90s."" This is a direct comment on the uncomfortable heat. The passage also indirectly mentions the discomfort of the passengers, but the only one who directly mentions the heat is the fire chief.

Therefore, the correct answer is A: 当他以 160 千米每小时的速度行驶时.
"
根据这段文字，为什么新西兰警察很难测量约翰·里德的速度？,"The correct answer is **B: 汽车底盘过低**.

The passage states: ""由于“黑美人”的底盘过低，新西兰警方没法用测速雷达枪来检测里德先生的车速.""  This directly indicates that the car's low chassis prevented the police from using radar to measure his speed. The other options are not directly supported by the text.
"

根据动物解放组织和皇家防止虐待动物协会 (RSPCA) 的总督察，以下哪种情况应该进行检查？,"The best answer is **D: 屠宰场**.

Here's why:

* The passage is about calls for mandatory CCTV in *slaughterhouses*. The goal is to improve welfare in *slaughterhouses*. Therefore, the *slaughterhouses* themselves are what the animal welfare groups want to see inspected/monitored.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: 闭路电视摄像头:** While CCTV cameras are being called for, they themselves aren't the subject of the inspection. They are a tool *for* inspection.
*   **B: 任何照看动物的人:** The passage mentions that the CCTV serves as a reminder to those caring for the animals, but the focus is not on the people themselves being inspected.
*   **C: 监控装置:** The CCTV is only the tool to do the monitoring.

Therefore, **D** is the correct answer."
根据这段文字，什么措施可以帮助巩固澳大利亚屠宰场工人对动物福利的重视程度？,"The correct answer is **A: 安装闭路电视摄像头**.

The passage states that the Animal Liberation Organisation and the RSPCA are calling for mandatory CCTV cameras in all Australian abattoirs.

Therefore, CCTV cameras would help reinforce the importance of animal welfare to abattoir workers.

"
克里斯蒂娜·费尔南德斯·德·柯克纳在哪里宣布了她的竞选意向？,"The correct answer is **C: 在距离布宜诺斯艾利斯 31 英里的阿根廷大剧院**.

The passage states: ""基什内尔女士在阿根廷大剧院宣布她有意参加总统竞选..."". And ""阿根廷大剧院"" is said to be in ""拉普拉塔市 (La Plata)"", which is ""距离布宜诺斯艾利斯 50 公里（31英里）"".

"
根据这段文字，有关布雷克的哪项陈述不准确？,"The correct answer is **B: He admitted to the assault**.

Here's why:

*   **A: He was arrested at the scene:** The passage states he was ""arrested at the scene"".
*   **B: He admitted to the assault:** The passage states he ""denied the assault"". This contradicts the statement.
*   **C: He used a stick in the assault:** The passage states he claimed he used a stick ""to prevent himself from being hurt"".
*   **D: He claimed people threw bottles at him:** The passage states he claimed ""up to thirty people were throwing bottles at him"".

Therefore, B is the inaccurate statement."
根据这段文字，以下哪项没有发生在布雷克身上？,"The correct answer is **C: He was attacked with a stick**.

Here's why:

*   **A: He was found guilty of obstructing justice:** The text states ""Blake was also convicted of attempting to obstruct justice.""
*   **B: He was arrested:** The text states ""The presenter, who was arrested at the scene..."" implying Blake was the presenter and was arrested.
*   **D: He was told that imprisonment was likely:** The text states ""The judge told Blake that his imprisonment was 'almost certain'.""

The text states that Blake used a stick to defend himself from people throwing bottles at him. It does **not** state that he was attacked with a stick. Therefore, option C is the event that did *not* happen to Blake, according to the provided text."
联合国的全球变暖基金将不用于哪方面？,"The correct answer is **B: 将技术带给发展中国家**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the UN wants to share technology with developing countries to help them develop in a less polluting way. This is a separate point from the global warming fund.

*   The passage mentions the fund is intended to help countries deal with the **impacts** of global warming, and lists防洪房屋(flood-proof housing), 改善水资源管理 (improving water management), and 促进农作物多样化 (promoting crop diversification) as examples of how the fund could be used.

Therefore, options A, C, and D are all mentioned as potential uses of the fund, while B is a separate initiative."
根据这段文字，联合国希望拯救什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 现存的雨林 (现存的森林)**.

The passage explicitly states ""巴厘岛会议议程中的其他议题还包括拯救世界上现存的森林 (The Bali conference agenda also includes saving the world's remaining forests).""

*   The passage states: “我们尚未就原产地规则和关税协定达成一致...” This indicates that原产地规则 (C) and 关税协定 (D) are outstanding issues.
*   The passage also states: ""...艾伯特·穆坎加宣布贝宁将加入联盟..."" which indicates that 贝宁是否加入AfCTA (A) is not an issue.
* The passage indicates: ""...我们现有的框架足以满足 2020 年 7 月 1 日开始贸易的需要。”"" which indicates that 贸易开始的日期 (B) is not an issue.

Therefore, the only thing not listed as needing agreement is the start date for trade."
根据这段文字，为什么可以在 7 月开始贸易？,"The correct answer is **B: 已经有了足够的规则和协定框架**

Here's why:

*   The text specifically states: ""we haven’t agreed on rules of origin and tariff concessions, but we have enough framework in place for trade to begin on 1 July 2020"". This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Because starting in July is one of the terms of Nigeria joining AfCFTA** - This is incorrect. The passage does mention Nigeria joining before the summit but doesn't claim the July start date as a condition of Nigeria's joining.
*   **C: It has been approved by the African Union Commissioner for Trade and Industry** - While the commissioner *stated* the framework was sufficient, that statement alone isn't the *reason* trade can start. The reason is the existence of *enough framework*, as stated in B.
*   **D: Rules of origin and tariff agreements have already been agreed** - The text explicitly says that these have *not* been agreed upon, so this is the opposite of what the passage states.
"
文章中提到，《亚特兰大宪法报》指责教育官员的什么行为？,"The correct answer is **C: 未对发现的内部问题采取行动**.

The passage states that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution report ""indicated problems were found within the schools, but no action was taken based on this finding."" This directly corresponds to option C.
"
根据这段文字提供的信息，《亚特兰大宪法报》的报道中没有提到什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 对于创新城市教育的建议**. Here's why:

*   **A: 不寻常的考试成绩提升情况:** The passage explicitly states the newspaper reported the ""考试成绩提升速度快得令人难以置信.""
*   **B: 有证据表明试卷被篡改:** The passage mentions ""报告显示，考试成绩提升速度快得令人难以置信，并称学校内部发现了问题，但没有根据这一发现采取行动"" 和“此后的证据表明试卷被篡改过”.
*   **C: 2013 年全国年度校长称号:** The passage mentions that Hall was awarded the title of National Principal of the Year in *2009*, but the lawsuits against her and other education officials are in *2013*. Thus, it wouldn't be something the newspaper would talk about.
*   **D: 对于创新城市教育的建议:** The report was about questionable testing results. The newspapers don't need to provide suggestions for how to fix urban education, their responsibility is to write articles on news.

Therefore, D is the best answer."
根据这段文字，爆炸事件之后已知的信息是什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 官方死亡人数 (Official death toll)**.

The passage states: ""一些报道称官方宣布的死亡人数为 8 人, 而据官方报道证实, 有多达 30 人受伤; 但是最终的数字尚未确定。"" This clearly indicates that there is a reported official death toll (though potentially inaccurate), making D the correct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 最终的受伤人数 (Final number of injured):** The passage explicitly states that the final number is *not yet determined*.
*   **B: 炸弹爆炸附近的建筑物 (Buildings near the bomb explosions):** The passage mentions the Governor's office and government buildings, but it doesn't describe *which* buildings or how they were affected. We only know the general area.
*   **C: 是否有其他炸弹被引爆 (Whether other bombs were detonated):** The passage states there were three additional explosions near the government buildings. We know that these bombs *were* detonated.

Therefore, only the official death toll is known information based on the text."
自 2017 年加盟曼城以来，杰西参加了多少场比赛？,"The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The passage states: ""From then, the Brazilian has represented the club in **53** games in all competitions and has scored 24 goals.""
"
杰西从哪个俱乐部获得了 2700 万英镑的加盟费？,"The correct answer is **A: 帕尔梅拉斯**.

The passage states that Jesus joined Manchester City *from* Palmeiras for a reported fee of £27 million. This means Palmeiras *received* the fee.
"
以下有关旅馆客人的哪项陈述是不正确的？,"The incorrect statement is **D: 大多数客人来自圣城**

Here's why:

*   **A: 客人们在麦加进行朝圣** - The passage states they are in Mecca ""on the eve of the Hajj pilgrimage,"" meaning they are *about to* perform the Hajj, not currently doing it. This could be considered technically incorrect, but not as incorrect as D.

*   **B: 一些客人不是本地公民** - The passage states that most guests are from UAE, but does not state all of them are from the UAE. It could be possible that some guests are not local citizens

*   **C: 客人们来这里是为了麦加朝圣前夕** - The passage explicitly says they arrived ""on the eve of the Hajj pilgrimage."" This is correct.

*   **D: 大多数客人来自圣城** - The passage states that the guests mostly are United Arab Emirates, not the holy city. This is incorrect."
根据这段文字，以下哪项陈述是正确的？,"The correct answer is **C: 客人们来这里是为了麦加朝圣前夕 (The guests came here for the eve of the Hajj pilgrimage).**

Here's why:

*   **A: 没有人死亡 (No one died)** is incorrect because the text states ""死亡人数至少为 15 人 (The death toll is at least 15)"".

*   **B: 所有客人都来自阿联酋 (All the guests are from the UAE)** is incorrect because the text states ""旅馆的客人大多是阿联酋公民 (Most of the hotel guests were citizens of the UAE)"". ""Most"" does not mean ""all.""

*   **C: 客人们来这里是为了麦加朝圣前夕 (The guests came here for the eve of the Hajj pilgrimage)** is correct because the text states ""这栋楼里住着一些朝圣者，他们是在麦加朝圣前夕来到这座圣城的 (The building housed some pilgrims who had come to the holy city on the eve of the Hajj pilgrimage)"".

*   **D: 大多数客人是麦加当地居民 (Most of the guests are local residents of Mecca)** is incorrect because the text identifies the guests as pilgrims and mostly UAE citizens, implying they are not local residents."
根据这段文字，以下有关撞击的哪项信息是确定的？,"The correct answer is **B: 撞击的位置**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states the satellites were flying at a specific speed and altitude when they collided.** This definitively indicates the location of the impact in terms of altitude above the Earth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 撞击的规模**: The passage states scientists are *still trying to determine* the size of the impact.
*   **C: 撞击对地球的影响**: Similar to the scale, scientists are *still trying to determine* the impact on Earth.
*   **D: 残骸的位置**: The passage says the US Strategic Command is *tracking* the debris, implying they don't have a completely fixed location for all of it yet.

Therefore, only the location of the initial collision is stated as a known fact.
"
根据这段文字，关于撞击还需要确定什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 撞击的确切规模**.

The text explicitly states: ""They are still working to determine the magnitude of the impact..."" (他们仍在努力确定这次撞击的规模...).  The other options are either already known (satellite speed) or not directly asked for in the text (A and C).
"
根据这段文字，巴滕曾经在全美最富有榜单上排名第几？,"The correct answer is **C: 第 190 名**

The passage states that Batten is a ""重要捐赠者"" to the University of Virginia.
"
哪一项不是由州长阿诺德·施瓦辛格签署的法案的一部分？,"The correct answer is **C: 在加州以外禁止向未成年人出售或出租暴力电子游戏**.

The passage states the law applies to sales *in California*. It doesn't extend to other states.
"
根据这段文字，谁错过了所说的话？,"The correct answer is **C: 米勒**.

The text explicitly states: ""我当时正在做准备，所以没听清他在说什么.""  ""我"" refers to Miller (米勒), and ""他在说什么"" refers to what Mike was saying at the hearing. Therefore, Miller missed what was said.
"
根据这段文字，关于米勒在听证会上的经历，以下哪项是真的？,"The correct answer is **B: 他在准备的时候没有注意到 (He didn't notice because he was preparing)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Miller was preparing for the hearing and didn't listen to what Duval (referred to as Mike in Miller's statement) was saying. This directly supports option B.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 杜瓦尔在听证会上给米勒留下了印象 (Duval impressed Miller at the hearing):** The passage explicitly says that Duval didn't leave a big impression on Miller.
*   **C: 杜瓦尔的两个孩子在听证会上说了很多 (Duval's two children said a lot at the hearing):** The passage mentions Duval's children, but not that they were at the hearing or that they spoke.
*   **D: 他在听取杜瓦尔的故事时非常专注 (He was very focused while listening to Duval's story):** The passage states the opposite; he wasn't listening carefully because he was preparing.
"
谁建议对《清洁空气法》进行修改？,"The correct answer is C: 杰克·林顿 (Jack Layton)

The passage states that ""莱顿 (Layton) 在与首相会面期间要求修改保守党的环境法案, 他要求‘彻底重写’保守党的环境法案。"" which translates to ""Layton, during his meeting with the Prime Minister, requested amendments to the Conservative's environmental bill, demanding a 'complete rewrite' of the Conservative's environmental bill.""
"
谁否认《清洁空气法》被用作大选前的噱头？,"The passage states: ""自从联邦政府介入接管塔斯马尼亚州德文波特的默西医院的资金后，州政府和一些联邦议员批评此举是 11 月联邦大选前的噱头。 但澳大利亚总理约翰•霍华德 (John Howard) 表示，该法案只是为了通过额外拨付 4500 万澳元来防止医院设施被塔斯马尼亚政府降级。""

The question asks who denied the *Clean Air Act* was a pre-election gimmick. The passage refers to the intervention with the Mersey hospital as the potential gimmick, and John Howard denies that *intervention* was a gimmick. However, the Clean Air Act is related to Stephen Harper agreeing to have the bill reviewed.

Of the given options, none of them directly deny that the *Clean Air Act* was used as a gimmick. However, the Australian Prime Minister John Howard denies that the hospital funding was a gimmick. Since Stephen Harper is also a Prime Minister, the best answer is:

**B: 一位总理**
"
当氰尿酸和三聚氰胺在猫的尿液中相互作用时，会形成什么物质？,"The correct answer is **C: 结晶 (Crystals)**.

The passage states: ""研究人员观察到，在添加三聚氰胺和三聚氰尿酸后，猫的尿液中形成了**结晶**"" (The researchers observed that **crystals** formed in the urine of cats after adding melamine and cyanuric acid).
"
研究人员使用红外光谱来观察什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 宠物尿液中的结晶组成**.

The passage states that FTIR (红外光谱) was used to compare the composition of crystals formed in cat urine after adding melamine and cyanuric acid to the crystals found in the urine of affected pets. This means FTIR was used to analyze the **composition** of the crystals.

"
谁称露娜为“难以捉摸”？,"The correct answer is **B: 达斯汀·鲁内尔斯**.

The text states ""达斯汀·鲁内尔斯（Dustin Runnels，外号“金沙”）评论说：“卢娜和我一样难以捉摸……她可能要更难摸透……我爱她，也会想她……希望她去到了更好的地方。”"" This directly attributes the description of Luna as ""难以捉摸"" to Dustin Runnels.
"
事故中的司机没有发生什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 他的头部受到伤害 (His head was injured)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""司机的头部受到了重创 (The driver's head was severely injured)"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 他没有伤害房子里面的任何人 (He did not injure anyone inside the house):** This is true based on the passage but it's not what *happened* to the driver, it's what *didn't* happen to other people. The question asks what happened to the driver.
*   **C: 他从剑桥的一家医院转移到大雅茅斯的一家医院 (He was transferred from a hospital in Cambridge to a hospital in Great Yarmouth):** The passage states the opposite - he was transferred *from* Great Yarmouth *to* Cambridge.
*   **D: 紧急救援人员帮助他离开车辆 (Emergency personnel helped him out of the vehicle):** While true, this is an action that was performed on him and not something that happened to him, like an injury. Also, while accurate, option A is more to the point of what the driver suffered in the accident."
什么在南非的橄榄球比赛中并没有脱颖而出？,"The correct answer is **C: 在比赛开始时的出色表现**.

The passage states that ""In their match against their southern sisters, South Africa looked distinctly rusty."" This means their performance at the *beginning* of that particular match was not outstanding. The passage explicitly praises their teamwork, ball handling, and defensive skills.
"
根据这段文字，南非队的表现何时开始改进？,"The correct answer is **D: 随着比赛的进行**.

The passage states: ""在与南方姐妹队的比赛中，南非队看起来明显有点生疏，但随着比赛的进行，南非队的表现稳步改进。"" This directly indicates their performance improved as the game progressed.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项陈述并没有准确地反映中国的经济情况？,"The correct answer is **D: 中国的汽车出口量从未超过德国**.

The passage states that ""去年，中国的汽车出口量首次超过德国..."" which directly contradicts option D.  The other options are all supported by the text:

*   **A: 中国的经济自改革以来呈指数级增长:** ""中国的经济规模增长了 90 倍"" implies rapid, exponential growth.
*   **B: 中国拥有比美国更大的汽车出口市场:** ""并超越美国成为汽车出口最大的市场"" means China's export market is bigger than the U.S.
*   **C: 中国可能最终拥有比美国更大的GDP:** ""中国的 GDP 有可能在 20 年内反超美国"" means the possibility exists.

Therefore, only option D is demonstrably false based on the provided text."
根据这段文字，中国的GDP何时可能超过美国？,"The correct answer is **B: 在二十年内**

The text explicitly states: ""中国的 GDP 有可能在 20 年内反超美国."" (China's GDP might surpass the US within 20 years).
"
胡指出发展中国家应该做什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 避免走污染的老路 (Avoid following the old path of polluting first and then cleaning up).**

The passage states, ""胡锦涛鼓励发展中国家“不要重走先污染后治理的老路” (Hu Jintao encouraged developing countries ""not to repeat the old road of polluting first and then cleaning up"")."" This directly corresponds to option D.
"
胡没有提到什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 二氧化碳排放削减数额**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 减排的基础 (The basis of emissions reduction):**胡 said the reduction would be based on China's economic output.
*   **B: 针对发展中国家的污染建议 (Pollution advice for developing countries):**胡 encouraged developing countries to avoid the ""pollute first, clean up later"" path.
*   **C: 二氧化碳排放有望削减的日期 (The date by which CO2 emissions are expected to be reduced):**胡 said the goal was to reduce emissions by 2020.
*   **D: 二氧化碳排放削减数额 (The amount of CO2 emissions reduction):** The passage explicitly states that ""He did not set an amount for the cuts...""

Therefore, 胡 did not mention the specific amount of CO2 emissions reduction."
维尔曼表示以下哪个的情况并不好？,"The correct answer is **B: 安哥拉**.

Richard Veerman specifically states that ""安哥拉正面临有史以来最严重的疫情，当地的局势仍然非常糟糕."" This directly indicates that the situation in Angola is not good.

演员在卡米尔·圣桑的歌剧中鼓励观众做什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 参与使用大麻**

谁主要在歌剧期间吸食大麻？,"The answer is **C: 演员**.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: 阿波罗-联盟号**.
"
谁在事故中受伤了？,"The correct answer is **A: 吉布森**.

The passage states that Gibson was taken to the hospital and died soon after. While the passage also mentions children being upset, it doesn't say they were *injured*.
"
事故中涉及的人发生了什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 他们在尖叫和哭泣**

Here's why:

*   **P** states that Mr. Gibson died.
*   **P** also states that a worker in a garage said, ""孩子们正等着过马路，并且都在大声尖叫，哭个不停。”

So, the children who were waiting to cross the street were screaming and crying.

"
根据这段文字，哪些方面不会受到保守派的批评？,"The correct answer is **B: 重建工作的不足**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage says:**
    *   Conservatives criticize the *amount* of spending on relief and reconstruction (calling it ""Bush's New (Orleans) Deal"").
    *   Liberals criticize *who* got the reconstruction contracts (insiders).

*   **Therefore:**
    *   Conservatives *do* criticize relief spending (A).
    *   Conservatives *do* criticize reconstruction spending (D).
    *   Liberals criticize who got the contracts (C), so conservatives are not the source of that criticism according to the text

*   **Option B, ""reconstruction's shortcomings,""** is about the *quality* or *effectiveness* of the rebuilding, not the *amount* of money spent. The passage doesn't mention that conservatives are criticizing the failings of reconstruction. They are focused on the expenditure involved. Therefore, shortcomings would *not* be something that conservatives criticize based on this text."
谁在批评卡特里娜飓风救济工作的重建合同？,"The correct answer is **B: 自由派**.

The passage states that ""自由派人士对重建工作的批判主要集中在把重建合同授予了视为华盛顿内部人士的这一做法.""

*   **警察 (C):** The passage states that police with riot gear entered the yard and used tear gas on the prisoners.
*   **医院工作人员 (D):** The passage mentions that the injured were sent to the hospital, but there is no indication that any hospital staff were dealing with the remaining prisoners who stayed in the yard refusing to return to their cells."
以下哪项最终导致囚犯从暴动中退缩？,"The passage states that ""配备了防暴装备的警察进入了院子，并用催泪瓦斯把囚犯逼得走投无路."" This indicates that the催泪瓦斯 caused the prisoners to back down.

The passage states that ""volunteers in strict supervision count the votes according to a specific procedure."" It does not state that the volunteers *are* the candidate's representatives, only that the procedure is ""closely supervised"".

"
是什么促使艾伦开始了为期八年的寻找武藏号的行动？,"The correct answer is **D: He had a lifelong interest in war**.

The passage explicitly states that Allen started searching for the Musashi ""because of a lifelong interest in war."" The other options are related to the search but not the primary motivation:

*   **A: His wealth** - While his wealth enabled the search, it wasn't the reason *why* he started it.
*   **B: He had an interest in mapping the sea bed** - The mapping was a method used in the search, not the motivation for starting it.
*   **C: His investment in marine exploration** - This is also a consequence of his interest in the warship, not the cause of his interest in the warship.
"
根据这段文字，艾伦在什么方面花了大量金钱？,"The correct answer is **B: 海洋勘探**.

The text states that ""he invested a significant portion of his wealth in ocean exploration."" While the other options might be related to ocean exploration, the text directly states his investment in the broader category.

根据这段文字，下列哪项可能导致工厂内及其附近的危险情况？,"The passage clearly states that the Japanese Atomic Energy Agency detected radioactive materials cesium and iodine, and authorities suspect a container storing uranium fuel has broken and is leaking. This directly links the dangerous situation to the radioactive materials emanating from the uranium fuel.

While cesium and iodine are explicitly mentioned as detected radioactive substances, they are a result of the issue with the uranium fuel. The uranium fuel itself is the primary source of the danger.

White smoke, while concerning, isn't inherently dangerous in itself according to the passage.

Therefore, the best answer is:

**A: 铀燃料 (Uranium fuel)**
"
以下哪项不是发生事故后建议当地居民遵循的安全提示之一？,"The passage states the following safety tips:

*   Stay indoors

The passage states that NextGen allows air traffic controllers to ""more precisely locate aircraft."" While the other options are benefits of NextGen, the question asks about the *direct* benefit to air traffic controllers. The controllers themselves don't directly experience shorter routes, reduced emissions, or fuel savings. Their direct benefit is improved location information.
"
根据这段文字，历史学家没有批判FBI专注于以下哪项内容？,"The correct answer is **C: 重点关注色情案件**.

Here's why:

*   **P** explicitly states that historians criticized the FBI for focusing on easy cases like car theft to boost their success rate.
*   **Q** states that Congress mandated the FBI to focus on pornography in 2005.

Therefore, the historians' criticism was about focusing on easy cases (A, B, and D) to improve their success rate, not focusing on pornography cases, which was mandated by Congress at a later date."
扫黄倡议迫使FBI做什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 指派探员处理色情案件**

The passage states that Congress mandated the FBI assign 10 agents to fight adult pornography as part of the anti-pornography initiative. This directly answers the question of what the initiative forced the FBI to do.

The passage states: ""身为国家安全顾问，他曾协助卡特处理诸多国际事务，例如...1979 年导致伊朗人质危机的伊朗革命"". This indicates that he advised Carter during the Iranian Revolution.
"
谁担任了国家安全顾问的职务直到 1977 年？,"The passage states: ""he subsequently succeeded Henry Kissinger as National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981."" This means Kissinger held the position *before* 1977.

以下哪项陈述没有准确反映出博贝克在贝尔格莱德的职业生涯？,"The correct answer is **A: 他在为球队效力期间打攻入超过 468 球 (He scored more than 468 goals while playing for the team)**.

The passage states that Bobek scored 403 goals in 468 appearances. Option A says he scored more than 468 goals, which is false. The other options are all supported by the passage:

*   **B:** ""没有人比博贝克 (Bobek) 的出场次数更多、为俱乐部进球得分更多的了"" (""No one has more appearances or scored more goals for the club than Bobek."")
*   **C:** ""1995 年，他当选为游击队史上最佳球员"" (""In 1995, he was chosen as the best player in Partizan's history."")
*   **D:** ""没有人比博贝克 (Bobek) 的出场次数更多、为俱乐部进球得分更多的了"" (""No one has more appearances or scored more goals for the club than Bobek."")"
哪项关于博贝克在贝尔格莱德游击队历史的陈述是正确的？,"The correct answer is **A: 他在 1945 年开始为游击队效力 (He started playing for Partizan in 1945)**.

Here's why:

*   **A** is directly stated in the passage.
*   **B** is incorrect. The passage states he was born in Zagreb and became famous while playing for Partizan. It doesn't say he played for a Zagreb team *before* Partizan.
*   **C** is incorrect. The passage says he played for Partizan until 1958.
*   **D** is incorrect. The passage states he became famous while playing for Partizan and was later named best player in 1995.

Therefore, A is the only statement supported by the passage."
根据这段文字，哪一个特征区分了伊氏西爪龙和迅猛龙？,"The correct answer is **B: It has a larger second claw**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that both *伊氏西爪龙 (Hesperonychus elizabethae)* and *迅猛龙 (Velociraptor)* are believed to have had feathers (C), were warm-blooded (D), and walked upright on two legs (A).
*   The passage explicitly mentions that *伊氏西爪龙 (Hesperonychus elizabethae)* got its name (""western claw"") from its larger second claw. This is presented as a distinguishing feature."
“赫斯佩罗龙”的意义来自于该物种的哪个身体特征？,"The correct answer is **A: 爪子**.

The passage explicitly states that the name ""Hesperonychus"" (meaning ""western claw"") comes from the fact that the dinosaur had a larger second claw.
"
关于枪击案的哪项陈述是正确的？,"The correct answer is **D: 枪击事件发生在布法罗 (The shooting happened in Buffalo)**.

Here's why:

*   The text mentions the couple came to Buffalo to celebrate with friends and family, and that the husband, originally from Buffalo, was one of the victims of the shooting. This directly implies the shooting occurred in Buffalo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 丈夫和妻子都来自德克萨斯州 (Both the husband and wife are from Texas)**: The text states they were married in Texas, but only the husband is mentioned as being born in Buffalo. We don't know where the wife is from.
*   **B: 有五名受害者 (There were five victims)**: The text specifically says there were four fatalities in the shooting.
*   **C: 这对夫妇一年前在布法罗结婚 (The couple got married in Buffalo a year ago)**: The text says they got married in Texas a year ago."
哪一项关于枪击案的陈述是准确的？,"The correct answer is **A: 发生在布法罗的一个周年纪念活动上**

The passage explicitly states the shooting occurred at a party in Buffalo celebrating the couple's one-year anniversary.
"
根据这段文字，官员们最初对“Luno”号的担心是什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 燃料泄漏 (Fuel Leakage)**.

The text states: ""...起初官员们担心这艘船上装的货物可能会泄漏 (Initially, officials were worried that the cargo on board might leak)."" While the text mentions fuel and fertilizer, the specific concern expressed by officials was about potential **cargo leakage**, which, in this context, refers to the fertilizer.

Therefore, while fuel leakage is a *plausible* concern given the context, the *explicit* concern mentioned in the passage is about the ship's cargo. To best answer the question, you must choose what the original text emphasizes.
"
根据这段文字，关于“Luno”号的故障，以下哪项陈述是不正确的？,"Let's analyze each statement based on the provided text:

*   **A: 故障发生在装载货物之前:** The text says the ship was ""去装载常见的化肥货物的,"" meaning it was *going* to load cargo. This implies the fault happened before loading. This statement is likely true.
*   **B: 发生故障时船上有 100 米的燃料:** The text mentions the ship is 100 meters long, but it says it was carrying 120-160 cubic meters of fuel, not 100 meters. This statement is incorrect.
*   **C: 12 名船员中有一人受伤:** The text explicitly states that ""直升机救出了 12 名船员，其中只有一人受伤，鼻骨骨折."" This statement is true.
*   **D: 船被推到了防波堤:** The text states, ""大风和海浪把它推到了防波堤上."" This statement is true.

Therefore, the incorrect statement is B.

**Final Answer: B**"
阿尔及利亚在哪个年代获得独立？,"The correct answer is **C: 20 世纪 60 年代**.

The passage states: ""20 世纪 60 年代，他回到刚刚独立的阿尔及利亚，教授电影导演知识。"" (In the 1960s, he returned to newly independent Algeria to teach film directing.) This clearly indicates Algeria gained independence in the 1960s.

While the passage mentions screens were set up in Rome, Italy, and other places like Poland, the actual funeral service took place at St. Peter's Square.
"
爆炸发生后，谁因为严重的伤势接受了治疗？,"The correct answer is **B: 没有人**.

以下哪项运动被从奥运会项目中投票淘汰了？,"The correct answer is **C: 棒球**.

"
国际奥委会投票决定将以下哪项运动纳入奥运会？,"The correct answer is **C: 橄榄球联盟 (Rugby Union)**.

The passage states: ""橄榄球（更确切地说，联合会式橄榄球）以及高尔夫击败了其他五项运动，被选定为奥运会的参赛项目 (Rugby (more precisely, Rugby Union) as well as golf beat out five other sports to be selected as Olympic sports).""

"

在联合国维和人员引起疫情之前，海地上一次与这种疾病的接触是什么时候？,"The correct answer is **A: 19 世纪** (19th century).

The passage states: ""在军队到来之前，海地自 19 世纪初以来从未遇到过与该疾病有关的问题。"" (Before the arrival of the troops, Haiti had not encountered problems related to the disease since the beginning of the 19th century.)
"
哪个地点的废弃物导致了疾病的扩散？,"The correct answer is **B: 联合国营地**.

The passage states: ""诉讼材料显示，联合国营地未能对废弃物进行适当的消毒处理，因而导致细菌进入阿蒂博尼特河的支流..."" This directly links the waste from the UN camp to the contamination and spread of the disease.
"
爱尔兰政府计划做什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 出台更严格的毒品许可法律**

Here's why:

* **""为整顿这一局面，爱尔兰政府迫切希望议会推出立法 (To rectify this situation, the Irish government urgently wants parliament to introduce legislation).""** This indicates the government wants to change the current laws regarding the substance in question.
* **""不管是从公共卫生的角度还是刑事司法的角度来看，现在都应当尽快立法 (Whether from a public health perspective or a criminal justice perspective, legislation should be enacted as soon as possible).""** This reinforces the need for legislative action.
* **""卫生部长对以下两方面表示了关切：利用所涉物质暂时合法性谋取个人利益的人员保障，以及自（现在看来）违宪的修改条例生效以来所作出的与毒品有关的定罪 (The Minister for Health expressed concern about the protection of individuals who exploit the temporary legality of the substance for personal gain, and the drug-related convictions made since the (now apparently) unconstitutional amendment came into effect).""**  The minister is concerned about people exploiting loopholes and convictions that are now potentially invalid. This suggests the government wants to close those loopholes and clarify the law.

Considering these points, the government is likely aiming to introduce *stricter* laws related to drug *control* (licensing) to address the issues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 对毒品犯罪者进行定罪 (Convict drug offenders):** The passage states that the government is concerned about possibly unconstitutional drug convictions so this is unlikely.
*   **C: 放宽有关毒品许可的法律 (Relax drug licensing laws):** This goes against the overall tone of wanting to ""rectify"" the situation and the Minister's concerns.
*   **D: 将毒品非罪化 (Decriminalize drugs):** The passage does not suggest decriminalization. The focus is on fixing legal loopholes and addressing convictions.
"
在爱尔兰什么是暂时合法的？,"根据文章内容，卫生部长对“利用所涉物质暂时合法性谋取个人利益的人员保障”表示关切，并且提到“自（现在看来）违宪的修改条例生效以来所作出的与**毒品**有关的定罪”。由此可知，暂时合法的是**毒品**。

因此，答案是：

**D: 毒品**
"
嫌疑人因何罪被调查？,"The correct answer is **A: 非法侵入**.

The passage explicitly states the suspect is being investigated for illegal trespassing.
"
在改变标志时，嫌疑人没有做什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 对它造成实际损坏**

The passage states: ""该标志没有受到实际损坏"" (The sign did not sustain actual damage). The question asks what the suspect *didn't* do. Therefore, C is the correct answer.
"
根据这段文字，英语教师卡诺没有被指控什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 与学生约会**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 侵犯版权 (Copyright infringement):** The text states he *was* accused of copyright infringement.
*   **C: 印刷未经授权的广告 (Printing unauthorized ads):** The text mentions Modern Education Group accused him of putting up unauthorized ads on buses.
*   **D: 在课堂上讲脏话 (Using profanity in class):** The text mentions he allegedly used profanity in class.
*   **B: 与学生约会 (Dating students):** The text only mentions he taught dating tips in his notes. There's no accusation of him actually dating students.
"
根据这段文字，谁没有被罗兰多·门多萨劫持为人质？,"The correct answer is **B: 警察**.

The text states that tourists were taken hostage, children and photographers were among those released (implying they were hostages), and the former policeman Mendoza was the hostage-taker, not a hostage himself.
"
根据这段文字，哪些人质没有确认提前被释放？,"根据这段文字：

*   **老人、儿童、摄影师** 被确认提前释放。
*   **游客** 中，只有一部分（包括儿童和老人在内）被提前释放，其余人质的释放情况没有明确说明，可以理解为**没有确认提前被释放**。

因此，答案是 **A: 游客**。
"
根据这段文字，谁正在收集签名支持巴西同性婚姻合法化？,"The correct answer is **A: 抗议者 (Protesters)**.

The passage states: ""抗议者希望在请愿书上收集 120 万个签名，并在十一月提交给国民议会."" This clearly indicates that protesters are collecting signatures.
"

"
根据范思哲的说法，最强烈的风是什么时候开始的？,"The correct answer is **A: 表演开始几分钟后**

The passage states: ""表演开始五分钟后，刮起了风，约一分钟后，风速达到了 70 公里/小时..."" (The performance started five minutes ago, and about a minute later, the wind speed reached 70 km/h...)  This means the strongest winds (70 km/h) started shortly after the performance began.
"
在“弗雷德”之前，在西经 35°以东记录过多少次大风暴？,"The answer is **C: 两次**

The passage states that ""弗雷德”是有记录以来西经 35° 以东地区的**第三大**飓风.

This means there were two hurricanes before ""弗雷德"" that were stronger in that area.
"

The passage states: ""Fred"" is currently moving toward the northwest..."

The passage states that ""802.11n's speeds are considerably faster than previous technologies"". The question asks which of the options is faster than its predecessors. Since the passage explicitly states that 802.11n is faster than previous technologies, it is the correct answer.
"
要使 802.11n 向后兼容 802.11b，需要什么条件？,"The correct answer is **D: 双无线电**.

The passage states, ""It [802.11n] is backward compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g, *provided the base station has dual radios*.""

The text explicitly states: ""据报道，山底出现了与火山活动无关的乌云。 这些云可能会让人们怀疑火山到底有没有真正喷发过。"" This directly links the presence of the clouds to the potential for doubt about volcanic activity.
"

"
关于月船一号的月球探测器，以下哪项陈述是不正确的？,"The correct answer is **A: 发射探测器的轨道飞行器有一个乘员**

Here's why:

*   **P states:** Chandrayaan-1 (月船一号) is an *unmanned* lunar orbiter. Unmanned means it doesn't have a crew (乘员).
*   **P states:** The probe carried three important scientific instruments, so option B is correct.
*   **P states:** The probe successfully hard-landed, so option C is correct.
*   **P states:** The probe was imprinted with the Indian flag, so option D is correct.

Therefore, only option A is incorrect based on the information provided in statement P.
"
以下哪项陈述准确描述了月球探测器？,"The correct answer is **B: 它的迫降是成功的**

Here's why:

*   **B: 它的迫降是成功的** - The text states that the Moon Impact Probe ""successfully hard-landed."" Hard-landing implies a crash landing, but the text specifies it was successful.
*   **A: 它降落在月球北极附近** - The text says it landed near the *South* Pole.
*   **C: 它是从有人轨道飞行器中发射的** - The text says it was launched from an *unmanned* lunar orbiter.
*   **D: 它携带了两台关键仪器** - The text says it carried *three* important scientific instruments."

Due to lack of funding and lower priority compared to other diseases, plans to provide vaccines to historically epidemic-prone areas this year have been postponed.)"" This clearly indicates the vaccine distribution is planned for the future, later than the other measures mentioned.
"
这种疾病是如何传染给人类的？,"The correct answer is **A: 蚊子**.

The passage states: ""猪携带该疾病，然后通过蚊子传染给人类."" This means mosquitoes are the direct vector for transmission to humans.
"
第二个语句未能通过可能导致什么结果？,"正确答案是 **B: 未来有权进行同性民事结合**

解释：

* 文章明确指出 ""禁止同性民事结合的第二个语句未能通过，这可能会为未来的同性婚姻打开大门。"" 这直接对应了选项 B。

其他选项解释如下：

* **A: 对 HJR-3 的立即审查:** 文章提到的是下一届立法机构在 2015 年或 2016 年进行审查，并非立即审查。
* **C: 紧急立法会议:** 文章没有提到任何紧急立法会议。
* **D: 禁止同性民事结合:** 第二个语句原本是禁止同性民事结合的，现在它未能通过，意味着禁止被取消了，因此与选项 D 相反。
"
根据这段文字，第二个语句是在什么时候被删除的？,"The correct answer is **C: 周一 (Monday)**.

The text states that the Senate removed the second statement ""on Monday"".
"
“巴拿马文件”是被爆料给谁的？,"The correct answer is **B: 媒体**.

"
以下哪次空难造成的死亡人数最多？,"The passage states that ""伊朗一架飞往亚美尼亚的客机坠毁，机上 168 人遇难"". The other crashes listed had fewer deaths: the police helicopter crash killed 3, and the crash in Mashhad killed 17. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: 从伊朗前往亚美尼亚的飞机坠毁**
"
以下哪项不是伊朗空难频发的原因？,"The correct answer is **B: 缺乏购买新飞机的预算**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 民用和军用飞机老化 (Aging civilian and military aircraft):** The passage explicitly states that the country's civilian and military aircraft are old, indicating this is a contributing factor to the air crashes.
*   **C: 制裁阻止了新飞机的购买 (Sanctions preventing the purchase of new aircraft):** The passage directly mentions that Iran is unable to purchase new aircraft due to international sanctions, which makes it a reason for plane crash.
*   **D: 机队维护不善 (Poor fleet maintenance):** The passage states that aircraft lack maintenance.
*   **B: 缺乏购买新飞机的预算 (Lack of budget for purchasing new aircraft):** The passage mentions Iran cannot buy new planes because of sanctions, not because of the budget issue.

Therefore, the reason that is NOT directly stated or implied in the passage as the cause of the plane crash is a lack of budget. Sanctions prevent purchasing, which implies Iran could have the budget."
伊拉克研究小组的报告中没有包含以下哪项？,"The correct answer is **B: 声明通过某些变革可以避免日益严重的暴力**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 对目前政策的批评:** The passage explicitly states that the report ""severely criticizes nearly every aspect of the administration's current Iraq policy.""
*   **C: 对于保护伊拉克边界的建议:** The passage mentions the report's first recommendation: ""new diplomatic offensive this year aimed at safeguarding Iraq's borders...and to reinvigorate diplomatic relations with its neighbors.""
*   **D: 呼吁美国形成共识:** The passage states that the report ""opens with a call for a broad public debate and a consensus on U.S. policy in the Middle East.""
*   **B: 声明通过某些变革可以避免日益严重的暴力:** The report warns that ""no course of action currently available in Iraq can guarantee an end to sectarian warfare, increasing violence, or a slide towards chaos."" It does not state that changes can definitely prevent increased violence.

Therefore, the report *doesn't* contain a guarantee that certain changes will avoid increased violence."
伊拉克研究小组在报告中没有敦促以下哪项？,"The correct answer is **A: 宣布保证阻止暴力增长**.

Here's why:

*   **B: 立即改变方向** - The passage explicitly states the report ""urges an immediate change of course.""
*   **C: 展开公开辩论** - The passage states the report ""opens with a call for a new public debate and consensus.""
*   **D: 采取新的外交行动** - The passage mentions the first recommendation is ""new diplomatic offensive before the end of this year.""
*   **A: 宣布保证阻止暴力增长** - The passage states the report warns against the belief that violence can be stopped by current actions. This is the opposite of guaranteeing to stop violence growth, so the report does NOT urge this."
根据警方的说法，谁被认为是普罗文扎诺的得力助手？,"The correct answer is **B: 洛皮科洛**.

The passage states: ""警方表示，洛皮科洛之所以能占上风，是因为他曾是普罗文扎诺在巴勒莫的得力助手。"" (Police said that Lo Piccolo was able to gain the upper hand because he was Provenzano's right-hand man in Palermo.)
"
根据这段文字提供的信息，法尔科内之死的原因是什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 他在里亚纳发动的战争中被杀害**.

The passage states: ""1992 年，普罗文扎诺（Provenzano）结束了由里亚纳发动的反政府的战争，这场战争夺去了黑手党十字军乔瓦尼·法尔科内（Giovanni Falcone）和保罗·博尔塞利诺（Paolo Borsellino）的生命..."" This directly links Falcone's death to the war started by Riina.
"
以下哪项不是齐藤仁的荣誉之一？,"The correct answer is **A: 两次世界冠军**.

The passage states he was a former world champion (singular), not a two-time world champion. The other options are all explicitly mentioned in the passage as his honors or roles.
"
岩崎避免在哪里立誓？,"The correct answer is **B: 尼泊尔 (Nepal)**.

The passage states that Iwasaki ""escaped a wedding"" in Nepal. This implies he avoided getting married, which could be interpreted as avoiding taking vows.
"
谁袭击了岩崎？,"The correct answers are B, C, and D. The passage states that Iwazaki was robbed by pirates, attacked by a mad dog, and arrested by the police. While the passage does mention escaping a marriage in Nepal, it does not mention an attack by a fiance.

Therefore the answer is **B: 海盗 (Pirates), C: 一只狗 (A dog), and D: 警察 (Police)**.
"
阿隆索在什么时候退出了比赛？,"The correct answer is **C: 在舒马赫退出比赛之后**

The passage states ""迈克尔·舒马赫在阿隆索退赛后不久也退出了比赛"", meaning Schumacher retired *after* Alonso retired.
"
是什么导致舒马赫提前退出比赛？,"The correct answer is **D: 汽车悬架损伤**

"
根据这段文字，谁负责为被捕者设定保释金？,"The correct answer is **D: 法庭专员 (Court Commissioners)**.

The passage states that ""If approved, the court commissioner can set bail...""
"
根据这段文字提到的临时禁令，被捕者必须具备什么条件才能被关押超过 24 小时？,"The correct answer is **D: 听证会**

Here's why:

The passage states the temporary injunction mandates the release of those held for more than 24 hours **without a hearing before a court commissioner**. This hearing is where bail is set and charges are formalized. Therefore, to be held *longer* than 24 hours, a detainee *must* have had that hearing.
"
根据这段文字，哪个原因没有被用来解释为什么取消第二轮选举？,"The correct answer is **B: 违反宪法 (Violating the constitution)**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 安全风险 (Security risks)**: The passage explicitly states that cancelling the election would avoid security risks.
*   **C: 开支高昂 (High costs)**: The passage states that cancelling the election was to save money on another election.
*   **D: 宪法有歧义 (Ambiguity in the constitution)**: The passage says diplomats found enough ambiguity in the constitution to justify not holding the election.
*   **B: 违反宪法 (Violating the constitution)**: The passage states that prior reports had said cancelling the election *would* violate the constitution, contradicting the justification given in the passage. The passage itself doesn't present violating the constitution as a *reason* for canceling the election, but as something that might occur if the election is cancelled."
为什么外交官们最终认为不需要进行第二轮选举？,"The correct answer is **C: 宪法存在歧义 (宪法存在歧义)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""外交官们表示在阿富汗宪法中发现了足够多的歧义，因此没有必要举办决胜选举。 (Diplomats said they found enough ambiguity in the Afghan constitution that it was not necessary to hold a runoff election.)""
"
谁为 FATA 提供司法服务？,"The answer is **B: 政治代理**.

The passage states: ""These agents were responsible for providing governmental and judicial services according to Article 247 of the Constitution of Pakistan."" Since ""these agents"" refers to the ""political agents,"" they are the ones providing judicial services.
"
关于 FATA 的“政治代理”，以下哪项陈述不正确？,"The passage states:

*   Political agents are appointed by the President of Pakistan.
*   They provide governmental and judicial services.
*   They administer FATA with near complete autonomy.
*   They provide services according to Article 247 of the Pakistan Constitution.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: They provide judicial services** - The passage states that they provide judicial services, so this statement *is* correct.
*   **B: They are selected by the Pakistani President** - The passage states that they are appointed by the President, so this statement *is* correct.
*   **C: They abide by the Pakistani constitution** - The passage states they provide services according to Article 247 of the constitution, so this statement *is* correct.
*   **D: They have complete control over some areas** - The passage says FATA had *almost* complete autonomy, not that the agents *had* complete control, so this statement is incorrect.

Therefore, the answer is **D**.
"
艾玛·斯通被提名哪个奖项？,"The correct answer is **C: 最佳女主角**. The passage explicitly states ""高斯林和斯通分别获得了最佳男主角和最佳女主角的提名 (Gosling and Stone were nominated for Best Actor and Best Actress respectively).""
"

*   The passage states: ""日本广播协会 (NHK) 还报道说，位于新泻县的柏崎刈羽 (Kashiwazaki Kariwa) 核电站运行正常 (NHK also reported that the Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear power plant in Niigata Prefecture is operating normally).""

The other options are incorrect based on the text:

*   A: The passage says the reactors at Shika Nuclear Power Plant were already shut down.
*   B: The passage says the airport is closed.
*   C: The passage says rail services are disrupted."
根据这段文字，以下哪里因地震而受到损坏？,"The correct answer is **C: 一些道路**.

The text explicitly states: ""一些道路受到了损坏"" (Some roads were damaged). While the other options are mentioned, they are not described as damaged:

*   **A: 一些房屋 (Some houses)** - The text mentions 9400 houses without water and 100 without electricity, but doesn't say they are damaged.
*   **B: 志贺核能发电厂的两个反应堆 (The two reactors at the Shika Nuclear Power Plant)** - The text says they were shut down and not affected by the earthquake.
*   **D: 能登机场 (Noto Airport)** - The text says it remains closed, but does not say it is damaged."
根据这段文字，以下哪个问题不包含在该文件中？,"The correct answer is **B: 1967 年战争的原因**

Here's why:

*   **A: 耶路撒冷的未来** - The text explicitly states the future status of Jerusalem is one of the topics for discussion.
*   **C: 山谷中的军事力量** - The text mentions Israel wants military presence in the valley for ten years and the PA only agrees to five years, which means the military presence in the valley is a question the document addresses.
*   **D: 边界争端** - The text directly states that the document mentions the border dispute.

Therefore, the 1967 war is not mentioned in the agreement."
以下哪项不是巴勒斯坦的要求之一？,"The correct answer is **B: 约旦河谷的持续军事力量存在**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states Israel, not Palestine, wants a ten-year military presence in the Jordan Valley. Palestine only agrees to five years.
*   A is mentioned as a point in the document.
*   C is mentioned as a point in the document.
*   D is something that Palestine wants."
马曾在哪个国家/地区学习法律？,"The passage states that Ma attended Harvard Law School, which is in the United States. Therefore, the correct answer is A: 美国 (United States).
"
根据这段文字，对哪个国家/地区的主张有助于马当选？,"The correct answer is **D: 中国**

The passage states: ""马英九在一次演讲中主张与中国大陆建立更加紧密的联系，并轻松获胜。"" This directly indicates that his stance on closer ties with China contributed to his victory. The other options are incorrect because the passage mentions his birth in Hong Kong and education/residency in the US, but it doesn't explicitly state that these factors helped him get elected.
"
根据这段文字，卡罗琳·威尔逊在溜出城之前曾为谁工作？,"The correct answer is **C: OHA** (奥克兰住房管理局).

"
在赛季剩余四场比赛中，谁在车手积分榜上排名第四？,"The passage states: ""Hamlin is in third place, twenty points back, but five points ahead of Bowyer."" This means Bowyer is in fourth place.

"
在文中提到的比赛之后，卡纳在车手积分榜中获得多少分？,"The correct answer is **A: 2220**

The passage states ""卡纳 (Kahne) ... 以 2,220 分位列第五"".
"
根据这段文字，人们目击到落下的陨石后被证实为来自火星的有多少次？,"正确答案是 **B: 五次**

原文第一句话明确说明这是“人类历史上第五次观测到经过化学方式证实的火星物质坠落到地球上”。
"
在文章中提到的来自火星的岩石，哪个说法是正确的？,"The correct answer is **D: 有 34 块** (There are 34 pieces).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""在已知的大约 24,000 块坠落至地球的陨石中，经核实只有 34 块是来自火星"" which translates to: ""Of the roughly 24,000 meteorites known to have fallen to Earth, only 34 have been verified as originating from Mars.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 所有这些岩石都是在七月份的流星雨期间发现的** (All of these rocks were found during the July meteor shower): The passage says 15 of the rocks are from the July meteor shower, not all 34.
*   **B: 有 24,000 块** (There are 24,000 pieces): This refers to the total number of meteorites found on Earth, not just those from Mars.
*   **C: 它们的价值比黄金高 11,000 美元** (They are worth $11,000 more than gold): While some are valued between $11,000 and $22,500 *per ounce*, this doesn't mean they are simply $11,000 more valuable than gold. The passage states they can be ten times the price of gold.
"
舒马赫是什么时候退役的？,"The correct answer is **B: 在第七次夺得冠军后**

Here's why:

马萨是什么时候受伤的？,"The correct answer is **A: 在一次大奖赛期间 (zai yi ci da jiang sai qi jian) - During a Grand Prix**.

The passage states Massa was injured ""during the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.""
"
根据这段文字，这项安排将如何影响 AOL？,"The correct answer is **C: AOL 的用户数量将与雅虎和微软的用户数量不相上下**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Yahoo and Microsoft's combined user base is about the same size as AOL's. The implication is that AOL's dominant position in the instant messaging market is being challenged. Therefore, we can infer that its share of the market may shrink.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: AOL 的用户数量可能会增加:** The passage suggests the opposite - AOL's user growth is unlikely because other companies are becoming more competitive.
*   **B: AOL 将成为唯一开发即时通讯市场的公司:** This is incorrect. The passage implies that other companies like Yahoo and Microsoft are challenging AOL in the market.
*   **D: AOL 将不再在美国使用:** This is not supported by the passage. The passage only mentions that AOL's dominance will be challenged."
以下哪一项可能因新的安排而结束？,"The correct answer is **C: AOL 按照自己的节奏开发市场的自由**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that AOL has been able to dictate the pace of the instant messaging market *because* of its dominance.
*   However, Yahoo and Microsoft together now have a comparable user base.
*   This increased competition means AOL will likely no longer be able to act independently, as it will need to consider the actions and strategies of its larger competitors.
*   Therefore, AOL's ""freedom"" to develop the market at its own pace is coming to an end.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The internet is already widely developed, and the passage doesn't suggest this will end.
*   **B:** Instant messaging will likely continue, not end. The *market* may change, but not its existence.
*   **D:** The passage suggests Yahoo and Microsoft already cooperate, which is why their userbases should be added together, so there's no indication that the cooperation is ending."
在袭击中有多少死者不是警察？,"The correct answer is **C: 0**.

The passage states that two police officers died in the attack. Therefore, there were no deaths of non-police officers.

"
根据这段文字，谁在党团会议的结果公布后对另一位候选人连连称赞？,"The passage states that ""金里奇连连称赞桑托勒姆"". Therefore, the correct answer is **B: 金里奇**.
"

The passage states that ""Early on, the show aired exclusively on TogiNet Radio..."". The other options are incorrect.
"
该电台描述这档节目有什么样的风格？,"The correct answer is **B: 极客的** and **C: 老派的**.

The passage states the show is described as ""带有全新震撼极客风格的老式广播剧！"" This directly translates to both ""geeky"" and ""old-fashioned"".

While the show started with amateur voice actors and local/Texan participants, this refers to the *participants*, not the style of the show itself.
"
戴维·黑德利收集了什么信息，最终帮助了激进组织的袭击？,"The correct answer is **A: 信息 (Information)**.

The passage states that David Headley's ""reconnaissance and intelligence gathering"" (which is information) helped the attackers. The other options are weapons or people involved in the attack, not what Headley specifically provided.

"
根据这段文字，纳达尔和拉奥尼奇在第一个发球局后的排名是什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 纳达尔赢得 76 分** and **D: 拉奥尼奇击败了纳达尔**.

Let's break down why:

*   **B: 纳达尔赢得 76 分** - This statement is directly supported by the text: ""纳达尔（Nadal ）在比赛中把 88% 的净胜分收入囊中，**在第一个发球局赢得 76 分**"" (Nadal won 76 points in the first service game).

*   **D: 拉奥尼奇击败了纳达尔** - The text states ""不久前，他在布里斯班公开赛上败于拉奥尼奇"" (Not long ago, he lost to Raonic in the Brisbane Open). This means Raonic defeated Nadal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 拉奥尼奇有 88% 的净胜分** - The text says Nadal had 88% of the net points (""纳达尔（Nadal ）在比赛中把 88% 的净胜分收入囊中""), not Raonic.

*   **C: 比分是 7-2** - The text states ""纳达尔（Nadal）与加拿大人的交手记录是 7-2"" (Nadal's head-to-head record against the Canadian is 7-2). This is their overall record, not the score of this particular match.
"
以下哪种语言节目不包括在裸体新闻三档新的广播节目中？,"The correct answer is **C: 日语**.

The passage states that Naked News already reports in English and Japanese, and the three new programs will be in Spanish, Italian, and Korean. Therefore, Japanese is not included in the new programs.
"
根据这段文字，新的裸体新闻广播将不会在哪里播出？,"The correct answer is **C: 剧院 (Theaters)**.

The text states the new programs are launching for television, web, and mobile devices. It does not mention theaters.
"
有多少名选手没有完成大回转比赛？,"正确答案是 **D: 45**

根据文本，大回转项目（Giant Slalom）的 117 名选手中，有 **45 人** 未能挤进榜单。"
以下哪项陈述准确反映了锦标赛的比赛结果？,"让我们分析一下每个选项：

*   **A: 在第二场比赛中，卡帕内多在匈牙利滑雪选手之前完成比赛** - 文本说卡帕内多在大回转比赛中排名第十，而匈牙利选手排名第九。所以卡帕内多在匈牙利选手之后完成比赛。**不正确。**

*   **B: 有 45 名滑雪选手在大回转比赛中未能完赛** - 文本说大回转项目（Giant Slalom）的 117 名选手中，有 45 人未能挤进榜单，这意味着他们未能完成比赛。**正确。**

*   **C: 完成大回转的滑雪选手多于障碍滑雪的选手** - 障碍滑雪比赛有36名滑雪者未能完成比赛，116名参赛者参加了该比赛，这意味着（116-36 = 80）名滑雪者完成了该比赛。大回转比赛有45名滑雪者未能完成比赛，117名参赛者参加了该比赛，这意味着（117-45 = 72）名滑雪者完成了该比赛。因此，完成障碍滑雪的滑雪选手比完成大回转的滑雪选手多。**不正确。**

*   **D: 卡帕内多在障碍滑雪比赛中名列第十** - 文本说卡帕内多在障碍滑雪比赛中以“未完成”的成绩结束比赛。**不正确。**

因此，正确的答案是 **B**。"

"
根据这段文字，以下哪项陈述准确地描述了维珍集团与北岩银行的交易？,"The correct answer is **B: 维珍集团在银行国有化后收购了该银行**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""2010 年，当时的高街银行北岩银行（Northern Rock plc）在国有化的同时，从 “坏银行” 北岩资产管理公司 （Northern Rock Asset Management）中剥离出来. 维珍集团只收购了北岩银行“好的部分”..."". This indicates that Virgin Group's acquisition happened after the bank's nationalization.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 维珍集团也收购了北岩银行的资产管理公司**: The passage explicitly says Virgin Group *did not* acquire Northern Rock Asset Management.
*   **C: 维珍集团在次贷危机期间为该银行提供了紧急援助**: The passage mentions Northern Rock requested government assistance, not Virgin Group.
*   **D: 维珍集团对该银行的第一次出价是在该银行被国有化后**: The passage states Virgin Group made an offer *before* nationalization, which was rejected. The actual acquisition happened after the nationalization.
"
根据这段文字，哪个国家受到了《京都气候议定书》签署的影响？,"The correct answer is **C: 澳大利亚**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the former conservative government of **Australia** refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol, fearing economic consequences.
*   The passage also mentions that **the USA** is the only country that didn't sign the agreement.
*   **India** and **China** are mentioned as countries that were not subject to emissions targets.
*   Only **Australia** felt the need to reject the treaty for climate control and economic reasons.

Therefore, the impact on **Australia** is most directly discussed in the context of their decision not to sign and the reasons behind it."
根据这段文字所述，澳大利亚前政府认为批准《京都气候议定书》会对什么造成伤害？,"The correct answer is **B: 该国经济**.

The passage states that the former Australian government refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol because they claimed it would ""weaken Australia's economy.""

*   **监督:** 护林员会密切监督参加虫害防治补充试验的射手。（排除 C）
*   **人数:** 选中参与第一次射击行动的四名枪手。（排除 D）

选项A说“由于这是该计划的第一次试验，因此没有进行评估”，与原文“试验会受到监测，并会评估其效果”相矛盾。

因此，答案是 **A**。"
根据这段文字，分裂在哪里被发现？,"The correct answer is **B: 在一块化石上**.

The passage states that ""According to this fossil, this means that the split occurred much earlier than expected by molecular evidence."" This indicates that the finding (the split occurring earlier) is based on the fossil. While the research was conducted by a researcher at the Ethiopian Rift Valley Institute (D), and the term ""rift valley"" is mentioned (A), the direct source of the information about the split is the fossil. Molecular evidence (C) is mentioned as a point of comparison, but is not where the split was found.
"
根据这段文字，什么比预计更早地发生了？,"The correct answer is **B: 分裂**.

The passage states that ""this fossil...means the split was much earlier than molecular evidence suggested.""  Therefore, the split occurred earlier than expected.

*   The updated Xinhua news report mentioned the plane received a bomb threat, was forced to return to Afghanistan, and landed in Kandahar.
"
新华社最早的报道中没有陈述什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 飞机收到了炸弹威胁**

Here's why:

* **P (Premise) states:** ""早些时候，中国通讯社新华社报道了一架飞机已被劫持的新闻。 随后的报道称，这架飞机受到炸弹威胁，被迫返回阿富汗，降落在坎大哈。 早些时候的报道称，这架飞机被拒绝在乌鲁木齐紧急降落后，已返回阿富汗。"" (Earlier, Xinhua News Agency of China reported news that a plane had been hijacked. Subsequent reports stated that the plane received a bomb threat and was forced to return to Afghanistan, landing in Kandahar. Earlier reports stated that the plane had returned to Afghanistan after being refused an emergency landing in Urumqi.)

The premise indicates that the *initial* report by Xinhua mentioned the hijacking and the refusal for emergency landing but *did not* mention the bomb threat.

Therefore, the answer is **D**.
"
萨拉·丹尼尔斯在广播节目中宣布了什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 委员会将停止与鲍勃·迪伦取得联系的努力** (The committee will stop its efforts to contact Bob Dylan).

The passage explicitly states: ""由于附近的防洪堤已经被淹没，目前水位已达齐腰深度。"" (Because the nearby levees have been submerged, the water level is currently waist-deep.) While the passage mentions a past flood level of 20 feet during Hurricane Katrina, and the potential for 6 inches of rain to breach damaged levees, the current water level is specified as waist-deep.
"
“卡特里娜”飓风期间，第九区发生了什么？,"The best answer is **C: 洪水水位高达 20 英尺**.

The passage states that the floodwaters in the Ninth Ward reached 20 feet during Hurricane Katrina. The other options are related but not as directly answering the question of what happened *during* the hurricane specifically in the Ninth Ward.
"
以下哪项不是汉密尔顿确认的？,"The correct answer is **B: 其他患者感染病毒的可能性 (The possibility of other patients being infected with the virus)**

Here's why:

*   **A: 患者去过哪里 (Where the patient had been):** The passage states ""这名患者曾去过尼日利亚 (The patient had been to Nigeria)"".
*   **B: 其他患者感染病毒的可能性 (The possibility of other patients being infected with the virus):** While the passage *implies* a low risk by mentioning isolation procedures, it doesn't directly quantify or confirm the specific probability of other patients being infected. It is confirmed the isolation protocols were followed to prevent infection, but the *possibility* of infection is not zero.
*   **C: 是否遵循了适当的协议 (Whether appropriate protocols were followed):** The passage explicitly says ""医院遵循了感染控制规定 (The hospital followed infection control regulations)"".
*   **D: 患者目前的情况 (The patient's current condition):** The passage states ""霍华德大学医院收治的病人情况稳定 (The patient admitted to Howard University Hospital is in stable condition)"".

Therefore, only option B is something NOT explicitly confirmed by Hamilton in the passage."
科学家想要弄清楚什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 地球是如何形成的**.

"
根据这段文字，在摄影师被车辆撞倒之前没有发生什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 摄影师成功拍到了比伯的照片**

Here's why:

*   **A: 公路巡警命令摄影师回到马路对面:** The text states that the CHP twice ordered the photographer to return to the other side of the road before he was hit. So this did happen.
*   **B: 摄影师把他的车停在了 Sepulveda 大道上:** The text says the photographer parked his car on the other side of Sepulveda Boulevard. So this did happen.
*   **C: 摄影师拍摄了一张警察拦截的照片:** The text explicitly mentions the photographer taking pictures of a traffic stop. So this did happen.
*   **D: 摄影师成功拍到了比伯的照片:** The text only mentions Bieber issuing a statement regarding the photographer's death. It does not mention that the photographer successfully took any pictures of Bieber. In fact, the text says Bieber wasn't even present.

Therefore, the only option that *didn't* happen before the photographer was hit is that he successfully took a photo of Bieber."
在被车撞前，这位摄影师试图做什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 拍摄警察的拦截** and **C: 穿过繁忙的公路**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the photographer ""在Sepulveda大道的另一侧停车，开始拍摄警察的拦截，并在横穿马路后继续拍照."" This clearly indicates he was photographing a police stop and crossed the street to do so.
"
下面哪项陈述没有准确描述总统检测结果呈阳性后的状况？,"The correct answer is **A: He feels uncomfortable**.

While the passage states he has a fever and sore throat, these are symptoms, not a general statement that he ""feels uncomfortable"". The passage explicitly states he ""feels good and is in good spirits"" despite the symptoms. The other options (B, C, and D) are directly stated in the passage.
"
根据这段文字，关于总统下面哪项陈述是正确的？,"The correct answer is **C: 他身体状况良好，可以远程办公**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""除了发烧和喉咙痛外，我感觉不错，身体状况良好，并以远程办公形式继续着我的工作."" This directly supports option C.
*   **A: 他没有发烧** - The passage explicitly says he has a fever.
*   **B: 他将在家中待上几周** - The passage says he expects to resume all his duties by Monday, which implies a few days, not weeks.
*   **D: 他有重度病毒感染** - The passage states he has a ""轻度病毒感染 (mild viral infection)""."
根据这段文字，热带气旋风暴古努预计何时会不断减弱？,"The correct answer is **B: 当风速下降到每小时 83 公里左右**

The text states ""...到今天早些时候，风速为每小时 83 公里左右，预计会不断减弱"" which directly indicates that the weakening is expected when the wind speed is around 83 km/h.
"
热带气旋风暴古努的最高峰时风速有多快？,"The correct answer is **C: 每小时 149 英里**

The passage states ""热带气旋风暴古努（以马尔代夫语中一种以棕榈叶编织的袋子命名），在最高峰时风速可达每小时 240 千米（每小时 149 英里）"".

Option A: 每小时 149 公里 is incorrect because the peak speed was 240 千米.
Option B: 每小时 240 英里 is incorrect because the peak speed was 149 英里.
Option D: 每小时 83 公里 is incorrect because this was the speed today, not at its peak.
"
下面哪个不被认为是腰鞭毛藻的特征？,"The correct answer is **C: 它是多细胞的**.

The passage states that dinoflagellates are ""a naturally occurring single-celled marine organism"" (单细胞).  ""多细胞的"" means multicellular. All the other options are supported by the text.
"
腰鞭毛藻无法做到以下哪件事？,"The correct answer is **B: 在任何情况下数量急剧增加 (In any case, the number increases sharply)**.

Here's why:

*   **P states:** ""自然因素可以互相配合产生理想的条件，让这种藻类的数量急剧增加。"" (Natural factors can work together to create ideal conditions that allow the number of these algae to increase sharply.) This means that the sharp increase in the number of algae depends on specific conditions, not occurring in *any* case.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: 破坏鱼类的神经 (Damage the nerves of fish):** P states that the algae produce a neurotoxin that damages the nerves of humans and fish.
*   **C: 影响水质 (Affect water quality):** The entire passage is about how these algae affect water quality, leading to toxic conditions.
*   **D: 产生神经毒素 (Produce neurotoxins):** The passage explicitly states that the algae produce a neurotoxin."
根据这段文字，以下哪项不是飓风费利西亚的结果？,"The correct answer is **D: 街道洪水**

"
关于飓风费利西亚的哪项陈述是错误的？,"The correct answer is **B: 它最初被归类为热带低气压，然后变成了 4 级风暴**.

The passage explicitly mentions:

*   **A: 新物种的形成地点** (The formation location of the new species): ""厄瓜多尔加拉帕戈斯群岛"" (Galapagos Islands, Ecuador)
*   **B: 进化过程的长度** (The length of the evolutionary process): ""只进化了两代"" (only evolved in two generations)
*   **D: 参与繁殖的鸟类** (The birds involved in breeding): ""当地特有的达尔文雀中的勇地雀和外来的仙人掌大嘴地雀"" (local *Geospiza fortis* and introduced *Geospiza conirostris*)

The passage *does not* mention the name of the new species.
"
奔牛节将在哪里举行？,"The passage clearly states: ""今年 6 月至 8 月，这座城市将成为东南欧第一个举办全球最大公共艺术活动奔牛节的城市.""  ""这座城市"" refers to the Romanian capital, Bucharest.

"
以下哪项发现不是由于羽毛发现而得出的？,"The correct answer is **D: 确认大多数恐龙有羽毛**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 动物的羽毛颜色:** The passage explicitly states the researchers determined the color of the feathers: ""这种动物的羽毛顶部为栗棕色，底部为浅色或胡萝卜色"".
*   **B: 了解到羽毛不用于飞行:** The passage says, ""羽毛的结构表明它们不是用来飞行的，而是用来调节温度或炫耀的.""
*   **C: 对羽毛进化的深入了解:** The passage says, ""这一发现也有助于深入了解鸟类羽毛的进化."" Specifically, it provides insight into the timing of rachis evolution relative to barbs and barbules.
*   **D: 确认大多数恐龙有羽毛:** The passage states, ""这不仅证实了至少有些恐龙有羽毛——这一理论已经广为流传."" It confirms the *existence* of feathered dinosaurs, which was already suspected, but doesn't confirm whether *most* dinosaurs had feathers. The discovery supports the theory that *some* dinosaurs had feathers, but it doesn't provide enough evidence to confirm that *most* did."
恐龙的羽毛缺少什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 羽轴**.

The passage states: ""恐龙的羽毛并没有发育良好的主干——这称为“羽轴”"".
"
以下哪项关于 ZMapp 的陈述是错误的？,"The correct answer is **B: 它能够治疗现有的感染，但无法预防死亡**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""迄今为止，还没明确证明任何药物适合治疗现有的感染."" This means there is no proven drug to treat existing infections. Although the passage mentions that ZMapp was ""initially promising,"" formal studies showed it was not as effective in preventing death. So, if it isn't effective at preventing death, it is less likely to be effective in treating the actual infection.

Let's look at why the other options are correct statements based on the passage:

*   **A: 它由抗体制成:** The passage refers to ZMapp as an ""抗体鸡尾酒"" (antibody cocktail).
*   **C: 它在 PALM 实验中用作参照:** The passage explicitly states that ZMapp was used as a reference in the PALM experiment.
*   **D: 研究表明，它的好处比最初预想的要少:** The passage mentions that ZMapp was ""initially promising"" but formal studies showed it was not as effective, meaning its benefits were less than initially thought."
以下哪项陈述准确描述了 PALM 实验？,"The correct answer is **C: ZMapp 被用作实验的基线**

The passage explicitly states: ""In the PALM experiment, ZMapp was used as a reference. That is, scientists used it as a baseline, comparing three other treatments against it.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 这些研究显示它可能比先前预想的更有益:** The passage states the opposite, that formal studies showed it was less effective than initially hoped.
*   **B: 参照药物与其他三种治疗方法进行比较，其中之一是 ZMapp:** This is backwards. ZMapp *is* the reference drug, not one of the other treatments being compared *to* the reference.
*   **D: 它已被证明对治疗现有病症有效:** The passage states that nothing has been clearly proven to treat existing infections, and that ZMapp's effectiveness was ""somewhat disappointing."""
研究人员认为新型芯片对于哪里最重要？,"The correct answer is **A: 低收入国家**.

The passage explicitly states the researchers believe the chip will be most beneficial in low-income countries, where early detection of diseases like cancer, tuberculosis, AIDS, and malaria can significantly improve survival rates.
"

"
根据这段文字，以下哪个关于瓣状裂谷的说法是不正确的？,"The correct answer is **D: 在月球表面上并没有发现太多这样的地貌**.

Here's why:

* **A: 形成它们的事件可能是近期发生的** - The passage states ""...these scarps are ubiquitous across the Moon and are little weathered. This suggests the geologic events that formed them occurred relatively recently."" This aligns with the passage.
* **B: 它们的存在意味着月球不缺少地质活动** - The passage states ""This theory refutes the claim that there is no geological activity on the Moon."" This aligns with the passage.
* **C: 它们可能是月球收缩的结果** - The passage states ""Scientists have discovered a landform all over the Moon's surface called lobate scarps, apparently caused by the Moon shrinking very slowly."" This aligns with the passage.
* **D: 在月球表面上并没有发现太多这样的地貌** - The passage says ""...scarps are *ubiquitous across the Moon*..."". Ubiquitous means they are found everywhere. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.

So, the statement that is NOT true based on the passage is D.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪种关于地貌的理论表明月球上正在发生地质活动？,"The correct answer is **D: 这些地貌是近期形成的**.

Here's why:

* **The argument in the passage hinges on the recent formation of the lobate scarps.**  The passage explicitly states that the scarps are widespread, relatively unweathered, and therefore formed recently. This recent formation is used as evidence *against* the idea that the moon is geologically dead.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 月球正在缓慢收缩:** While the passage mentions the shrinking as the *cause* of the scarps, it's the *scarps themselves* that are direct evidence of recent (and therefore ongoing) geological activity.
* **B: 这些地貌是很久以前形成的:** This directly contradicts the passage's argument. If the scarps were old, they wouldn't be evidence of *current* geological activity.
* **C: 月球表面只有极少量这样的地貌:** This would weaken the argument. If the scarps were rare, they'd be less significant as evidence of overall lunar geological activity.
"
根据这段文字，在起诉之前，以下哪些内容不会再出现？,"The passage explicitly states that ""起诉的主要负责部门皇家检控署向记者表示，至少在提起公诉之前将不会再发表进一步言论。"" (The main responsible department for the prosecution, the Crown Office, told reporters that they would not make any further statements until at least the public prosecution was filed.)

"
根据这段文字，对于猎海豹船来说，以下哪个不是当前的问题？,"The correct answer is **D: 冰的融化 (Ice melting)**.

Here's why:

* **A: 极端的天气状况 (Extreme weather conditions)** is directly mentioned as hindering rescue efforts.
* **B: 积冰数量 (Amount of ice)** is mentioned as being the worst in 15 years.
* **C: 积冰的厚度 (Thickness of ice)** is also mentioned as being the worst in 15 years.
* **D: 冰的融化 (Ice melting)** is NOT mentioned in the text as a problem. The issue is the *abundance* and *thickness* of the ice, not its melting.
"
除了冰之外，还有什么因素影响了救援工作？,"The correct answer is **B: 天气条件**.

The passage states: ""不只是碎冰，极端的天气状况也让救援工作困难重重。"" (Not just broken ice, but extreme weather conditions also made rescue work difficult.) This directly answers the question.
"
罗伯茨没有证实哪种信念？,"The correct answer is **C: 生命的开始**

The passage explicitly states that Roberts ""断然拒绝谈论生命从何时开始的问题 (refused to discuss when life begins)."" All the other options are mentioned as something he affirmed or believed in.
"
罗伯茨觉得哪个话题过于不道德而不予评论？,"The correct answer is **D: 具体案例的细节** (Details of potential cases).

The passage states: ""...commenting on details of potential cases would be unethical.""
"
两束光照向哪里？,"The correct answer is **A: 照向天空**.

The passage states ""两束光被临时造出，彻夜指向天空"" which directly translates to ""Two beams of light were temporarily created, pointing towards the sky all night.""
"
根据这段文字，什么时候该地点正在建造新摩天大楼？,"The text says ""The site is being built with five new skyscrapers..."" This indicates the construction is happening in the present. While we know about 8:46 AM and the lights at night, the text directly states the construction *is being* done.

Therefore, the best answer is **D: Construction is underway**. While construction likely occurs during the day and potentially at night (implied by the lights), option D best captures the ongoing nature of the building process described in the text.
"
哪些信息表明“七姊妹”是洞穴？,"The correct answer is **A: 温度变化**.

The passage explicitly states that the temperature fluctuations observed through infrared imaging suggest the ""Seven Sisters"" are likely caves. It mentions they are cooler during the day and warmer at night compared to the surrounding surface, and that this thermal behavior is consistent with underground caverns.
"
如何观察“七姊妹”的热行为？,"The correct answer is **A: 红外图像**

The passage explicitly states that ""红外图像显示，昼夜温度的变化表示这些地方很可能是洞穴。"" This directly links the observation of thermal behavior to infrared images.
"
根据这段文字，关于嫌疑人的哪项陈述不正确？,"The correct answer is **D: He did not get injured.**

The passage states: ""涉嫌引爆炸弹的男子在爆炸中受伤，随后被拘留。"" (The man suspected of detonating the bomb was injured in the explosion and subsequently detained.) This directly contradicts option D. The other options are all supported by the text.
"
当局确认了哪些关于袭击的信息？,"The correct answer is **B: 嫌疑人的族裔**.

The passage states: ""当局仍然不知道他的名字，只知道他是维吾尔族人."" This means the authorities have identified his ethnicity as Uyghur. The passage also states that they don't know his name, so D is incorrect. The passage doesn't mention anything about co-conspirators or the motive, so A and C are incorrect.
"
哪些队伍将参加埃利斯公园的比赛？,"The correct answer is **C: 南非队和澳大利亚队**.

The passage states: ""该系列赛的最后一场比赛将于下周在约翰内斯堡 (Johannesburg) 的埃利斯公园举行，届时斯普林博克斯 (Springboks) 将迎战澳大利亚队.""

斯普林博克斯将在哪里进行下一场比赛？,"The correct answer is C: 约翰内斯堡
"
在任务中，空间站遇到了哪些困难？,"The correct answer is **A: 和推进器保持适当距离** (Maintain a safe distance from the thrusters).

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""焦立中（Chiao）和沙里波夫（Sharipov）与调姿推进器的距离是安全的."" This directly indicates a concern or difficulty related to maintaining a safe distance from the attitude control thrusters.
*   Option B is incorrect, as it states the space station was able to maintain a gyro. However the passage mentions that there was a lost gyro.
*   Option C is incorrect, as it was actually the Russian ground control center who started the plane.
*   Option D is incorrect, as while the space station did recover a normal pose, this was not a difficulty it encountered."
根据这段文字，空间站的任务目标是什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 完成太空行走**

Here's why:

*   The passage states the space station maintained its attitude until the spacewalk mission was completed.
*   Option A is incorrect as they did not go to space to look for the gyroscope.
*   Option B is incorrect as the passage states they maintained a safe distance.
*   Option D is incorrect because the mission was to complete the spacewalk and not to launch the plane.

Therefore, the primary mission mentioned in the context is completing the spacewalk."
关于此案件的哪项陈述不正确？,"The correct answer is **D: 美国在线被起诉**.

The passage states that AOL is the company **bringing** the charges, not the one being prosecuted. They are the victim of the spamming, not the defendant. The other options are all accurate based on the provided text:

*   **A:** The case was prosecuted in Virginia, where AOL's headquarters are.
*   **B:** A conviction was made in the case.
*   **C:** A spam-related law was used.
"

"
贾克为什么住在酒店里？,"The correct answer is **C: 他周日有比赛**.

The passage states: ""He was staying at the team's hotel, preparing to face Bologna on Sunday."" This directly indicates he was staying at the hotel in preparation for the match against Bologna.
"
为什么雅加达地质局不会发布预警？,"The best answer is **D: 它没有达到地震的震级要求**.

The passage states: ""由于此次地震没有达到 6.5 级，因此不会发布海啸预警."" This directly explains why the warning was not issued based on the earthquake's magnitude.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: 没有海啸威胁** While true, it's a consequence of the earthquake's magnitude. The earthquake's magnitude is the direct reason.
*   **B: 为了避免居民恐慌** The passage indicates that residents are *already* uneasy, so this isn't the reason for *not* issuing a warning.
*   **C: 为了避免对当地生意产生影响** The passage mentions businesses closing, but this is a consequence of the earthquake and the residents' fear, not the reason for the lack of a warning."
根据这段文字，地震造成了什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 当地居民坐立不安**

The passage states: ""尽管那里没有海啸的威胁，当地居民却感到坐立不安，纷纷结束生意及离开家园."" This directly translates to ""Although there is no tsunami threat, local residents feel restless, ending their businesses and leaving their homes.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 海啸威胁 (Tsunami threat):** The passage explicitly states there is *no* tsunami threat.
*   **C: 预警发布 (Warning issued):** The passage explicitly states no tsunami warning was issued.
*   **D: 6.5 级地震 (6.5 magnitude earthquake):** The passage says the earthquake *didn't* reach 6.5 magnitude, which is why no tsunami warning was issued."
以下哪个因素驱动太阳和其他所有恒星的活动？,"Let's analyze the given text:

* **""太阳和其他恒星的运行原理是一样的：星系中所有恒星的活跃度都完全决定于它们的光度和自转。""**  This directly states that activity depends on luminosity and rotation.
* **""一颗恒星的罗斯贝数由其光度和旋度共同决定，与等离子体流有关。""** This links Rossby number to luminosity, vorticity (which is related to rotation), and plasma flow.
* **""罗斯贝数越小，恒星在磁场倒转方面就越不活跃。""** This links Rossby number to magnetic field reversals and activity.

Now let's look at the answer options:

* **A: 光度和等离子体流 (Luminosity and plasma flow):** Plasma flow is indirectly related, but the primary drivers mentioned are luminosity and rotation.
* **B: 罗斯贝数、自转和磁场倒转 (Rossby number, rotation, and magnetic field reversal):** Rossby number is an *indicator* of activity, not the *driver* of activity. Magnetic field reversal is also an *effect* of the activity.
* **C: 自转和光度 (Rotation and luminosity):** This is the most direct answer based on the first sentence of the passage.
* **D: 光度、罗斯贝数和自转 (Luminosity, Rossby number, and rotation):** Similar to option B, Rossby number is a consequence of luminosity and rotation, not a direct driver itself.

Therefore, the best answer is **C**.
"
恒星的罗斯贝数是如何确定的？,"The correct answer is **A: 光度和自转 (Luminosity and rotation)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""一颗恒星的罗斯贝数由其光度和旋度共同决定 (A star's Rossby number is determined by its luminosity and vorticity).""  旋度 in this context translates to rotation.
"

*   **D: 这个病例不严重 (The case is not serious):** The governor actually says, ""这个病例很严重 (This case is very serious)."" Therefore, he did *not* make the guarantee that the case was not serious."
哪个戏说新闻来源是由两位前华盛顿大学学生创立的？,"The correct answer is **D: 《洋葱报》**.

The passage explicitly states that Heck and Johnson, while students at the University of Washington in 1988, conceived of a publication that spoofed news, and that this publication became *《洋葱报》*.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不包括在《洋葱报》讽刺戏仿类新闻帝国中？,"The correct answer is **B: 一部电影**.

The passage mentions:

*   A world atlas (""世界地图集"")
*   A website (""网站"")
*   A print publication (""印刷刊物"")

It does *not* mention a movie. Therefore, a movie is the item NOT included in The Onion's satirical empire, according to the passage."
根据这段文字，警察当时在看守什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 唐宁街入口处**.

The passage states: ""抗议活动于当地时间 11:00 (UTC+1) 左右在白厅 (Whitehall) 开始，白厅对面是首相官邸唐宁街的入口处，**由警察看守**。"" (The protest began around 11:00 local time (UTC+1) in Whitehall, opposite the entrance to Downing Street, the Prime Minister's residence, **which is guarded by police**.)

"
关于埃胡德·乌尔博士的研究，哪项陈述是正确的？,"The correct answer is **B: 一些先前患有糖尿病的老鼠不再患病** (Some previously diabetic mice are no longer diabetic).

Let's break down why:

*   The passage states: ""we now have 4-month-old non-diabetic mice that used to have the disease."" This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 结果可能对已患有 1 型糖尿病的人有益** (The results may benefit people who already have type 1 diabetes): The passage explicitly states ""he noted that the findings are not relevant to people who already have Type 1 diabetes.""
*   **C: 他对这些发现能带来治愈持乐观态度** (He is optimistic that these findings will lead to a cure): The passage says he, along with other experts, is skeptical that diabetes can be cured.
*   **D: 一些未患糖尿病的老鼠现在患有糖尿病** (Some non-diabetic mice now have diabetes): The passage states the opposite; mice that *had* diabetes no longer do.

Therefore, the only correct statement based on the text is **B**."
根据这段文字，埃胡德·乌尔博士对什么持怀疑态度？,"The correct answer is **B: 治愈是否可能 (Whether a cure is possible)**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states: ""和其他一些专家一样，他对糖尿病能否治愈持怀疑态度。(Like some other experts, he is skeptical about whether diabetes can be cured.)""
*   A is incorrect because while he points out the findings are not *relevant* to people with type 1 diabetes, the core of his skepticism is about the concept of a diabetes *cure* in general.
*   C is incorrect because the question focuses on Dr. Ur's skepticism, not his opinion on other experts' opinions.
*   D is incorrect because the article doesn't focus on whether the mice will stay non-diabetic. Dr. Ur is more concerned about whether the findings related to these mice can lead to a general *cure* for diabetes in humans."
以下哪项陈述未能准确地描述 CG4684 次航班的坠毁？,"The correct answer is **C: 飞机在坠毁前尝试着陆三次 (The plane attempted to land three times before crashing)**.

The passage states the plane attempted to land *once* before crashing. Option C incorrectly states it attempted three times. The other options are all supported by the provided text:

*   **A: 由于天气原因，飞机最初无法着陆 (Due to weather conditions, the plane was initially unable to land)** - ""恶劣天气 (adverse weather)"" caused the initial landing failure.
*   **B: 飞机坠毁在非常偏远的地方 (The plane crashed in a very remote location)** - The need for helicopter extraction and police rappelling into the jungle clearly indicates a remote location.
*   **D: 对飞机坠毁地点的搜索受到了天气的影响 (The search for the plane crash site was affected by the weather)** - ""恶劣天气 (adverse weather)"" hindered the search efforts."
是什么导致 CG4684 次航班放弃着陆？,"The correct answer is **D: 天气条件恶劣**.

The passage states: ""导致飞机着陆失败的恶劣天气，也使搜索工作受到了阻碍。"" This directly indicates that bad weather was the reason for the failed landing attempt.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项关于弗朗齐歇克·科瓦尔的经历是真实的？,"The correct answer is **B: 他最终没有受伤 (He ultimately was not injured)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""幸运的是我没有发生什么事"" which translates to ""Fortunately, nothing happened to me"". This directly implies he was not injured.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 他设法打破了一扇窗户 (He managed to break a window)**: The text says ""终于有一块玻璃碎了"" (finally a piece of glass broke) but doesn't say *he* was the one who broke it.
*   **C: 他试图逃离时弄坏了一把椅子 (He broke a chair trying to escape)**: The text mentions people using chairs, but not that *he* did.
*   **D: 他试图打破一扇窗户时受伤了 (He was injured trying to break a window)**: The opening sentence explicitly states that nothing happened to him, meaning he was not injured."
为什么很难评估热带风暴“丹妮尔”可能产生的影响？,"The correct answer is **C: 风暴远未登陆**

The passage explicitly states: ""鉴于风暴远未登陆，目前仍难以评估它对美国或加勒比地区的潜在影响."" This translates to: ""Given that the storm is far from making landfall, it is currently difficult to assess its potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.""
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项关于热带风暴“丹妮尔”的陈述不正确？,"The correct answer is **D: It is about to make landfall.**

Here's why:

*   **A: 对加勒比地区的影响尚不确定 (The effects on the Caribbean are uncertain)** - The passage explicitly states: ""鉴于风暴远未登陆，目前仍难以评估它对美国或加勒比地区的潜在影响 (Given the storm is far from making landfall, it is difficult to assess its potential impact on the US or Caribbean)."" So this statement is true according to the passage.

*   **B: 它是在大西洋形成的 (It formed in the Atlantic Ocean)** - The first sentence mentions ""热带风暴“丹妮尔”在大西洋东部形成 (Tropical Storm Danielle formed in the eastern Atlantic)."" This is directly stated.

*   **C: 它可能转变为飓风 (It may turn into a hurricane)** - The passage says: ""美国国家飓风中心的科学家预测，丹妮尔在星期三前将增强为一场大飓风 (Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict Danielle will strengthen into a major hurricane by Wednesday)."" So this is also true based on the passage.

*   **D: 它即将登陆 (It is about to make landfall)** - The passage specifically states that the storm is far from making landfall: ""鉴于风暴远未登陆 (Given the storm is far from making landfall...)."" Thus, this statement is incorrect."
根据这段文字，有人认为全球性疫情爆发前一定会发生什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 它一定会变得不那么致命**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""他特别提到一些研究表明，在引发全球性疫情之前，这种疾病必须先降低自身的致命性。"" (He specifically mentioned some studies indicating that the disease must first reduce its lethality before triggering a global pandemic.)

The passage says it *must* become less lethal *before* a pandemic can happen.
"
根据这段文字，台风距离福建有多远？,"The text states that the typhoon eye was approximately 70 kilometers away from Fujian Province.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 70 公里**
"
乔治·沃克·布什抵达亚洲后谁迎接了他？,"The correct answer is **D: 副总理**.

The passage states: ""He was greeted by Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng...""
"
总统何时谈到亚洲的贸易扩张？,"The passage states: ""在经过一周的中期选举失利后，布什向听众讲述了亚洲贸易扩张的形势."" This translates to ""After a week of losses in the midterm elections, Bush spoke to the audience about the situation of expanding Asian trade.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 在中期选举失利后 (After the midterm election losses)**.
"
根据这段文字，政府的总体目标是什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 缓解车厢过度拥挤的情况 (Alleviate excessive crowding in carriages)**.

Here's why:

* **P: 今天的公告也延续了政府在今年 3 月作出的承诺：为额外车厢提供资金援助。 新增 300 节车厢，使总车厢数达到 1300 节，以此缓解过度拥挤的情况。** This sentence clearly states that the reason for adding train carriages (and the funding assistance) is to alleviate overcrowding. The previous parts are the means to an end, but reducing overcrowding is the goal.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: 今年 3 月前，为额外车厢提供资金援助 (Provide financial assistance for additional carriages before March of this year):** This is incorrect because the announcement is a continuation of a promise made *in* March, not before. More importantly, it's a *means* (providing funding) not the *goal*.
* **B: 总共获得 300 节车厢 (Acquire a total of 300 carriages):** This is a specific detail of the plan, but not the overarching goal. Acquiring carriages is a *means* to reducing overcrowding.
* **C: 新增 1300 节车厢 (Add 1300 new carriages):** This is incorrect because the passage says the *total* carriages will be 1300 after adding 300, not that they are adding 1300 *new* carriages. It's also a step towards the goal, not the goal itself.
"
政府宣布了什么？,"The best answer is **A: They plan to fund an additional 300 railcars.**

Here's why:

* **A** directly reflects the first part of the provided text: ""...the government's commitment made in March to fund additional railcars. An additional 300 railcars...""
* **B** is correct, but it's a more general statement. The announcement is more specific than just a commitment to address railcar problems; it focuses on a concrete plan.
* **C** is incorrect. The text states the *total* number of railcars will be 1300 *after* adding 300. They are not funding 1300 *additional* railcars.
* **D** is incorrect. The text says the commitment was made in March, not that the problem will be solved by March. Also, the passage focuses on mitigating the issue of overcrowding, not eliminating it entirely.
"
根据这段文字，已知什么信息？,"The correct answer is **A: 威胁等级已降低**

Here's why:

*   The text states that there's ""没有情报表明近期会有袭击发生"" (no intelligence indicating an imminent attack) *and* that the threat level was lowered (把威胁等级降到严重级别). This means the threat level has been reduced.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 不再有任何威胁 (There is no threat anymore)**: The statement ""把威胁等级降到严重级别并不意味着整体威胁已经消失"" (lowering the threat level to serious doesn't mean the overall threat has disappeared) directly contradicts this.
*   **C: 预计会发生袭击 (An attack is expected to occur)**: The phrase ""没有情报表明近期会有袭击发生"" (no intelligence indicating an imminent attack) disproves this.
*   **D: 情报已确认袭击将是严重的 (Intelligence has confirmed the attack will be serious)**: The phrase ""没有情报表明近期会有袭击发生"" (no intelligence indicating an imminent attack) disproves this. Also the level ""serious"" does not indicate that an attack will be serious, only that the threat level is at this level."
以下哪项关于抗议的陈述是不正确的？,"The incorrect statement about the protests is **A: 总统委员会是对抗议的回应**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""该委员会是马尔泰利 (Martelly) 对始于 10 月份的大规模反政府抗议活动做出的回应."" This clearly says the Presidential Commission was a response *to* the protests, not the other way around.

The other options are all accurate according to the passage:

*   B: 延误的选举引发了抗议 - ""自 2011 年以来，由于一些选举未能如期举行而引发了这些抗议活动""
*   C: 抗议要求前任 CEP 辞职 - ""上个月，总统委员会建议前任 CEP 辞职，这是推动国家走向新选举措施的一部分"". While the protests didn't directly demand the CEP's resignation in this text, it was part of the move to hold new elections to quell these protests, which are intrinsically tied.
*   D: 抗议有时是暴力的 - ""...有时抗议还会升级为暴力事件."""
谁建议最后一任 CEP 辞职？,"The correct answer is **C: 总统委员会**

The text states: ""上个月，总统委员会建议前任 CEP 辞职...""
"
根据声明，美国体操协会在纳萨尔对运动员性侵之后没有支持什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 吊销执照** (Suspension of license).

The passage explicitly states that the USAG agrees with the USOC's statement that ""continuing to drive meaningful change within our organization may be more beneficial to athletes and clubs and the sport than decertification [suspension of license]."" This implies that USAG is *not* supporting decertification/suspension of license.
"
根据声明，美国体操协会和美国奥委会的主要目标是什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 为运动员营造安全的环境**

The passage states:

*   ""美国体操协会对美国奥委会的信函表示支持，并接受奥运会大家庭的严格要求，即为所有运动员营造一个安全的训练环境。""
*   ""美国体操协会和美国奥委会有一个共同的目标，那就是尽可能保证体操运动和其他运动的安全性，让运动员在安全、积极和充满支持的环境中追求他们的梦想。""

These lines clearly indicate that the primary goal of both organizations is to create a safe environment for athletes."
当事件发生时，这艘船正在前往哪个目的地？ ,"The correct answer is **C: 巴拉望** (Palawan).

The passage states: ""这是一艘复仇者级别的反水雷舰，正在前往巴拉望的普林塞萨港的途中"" (This is an Avenger-class mine countermeasures ship, en route to Puerto Princesa, Palawan).
"
关于文中提到的船只，哪项陈述中的事实不是真的？,"The correct answer is **B: 它的基地在巴拉望 (Its base is in Palawan)**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 它正在前往普林塞萨港的途中 (It is on its way to Puerto Princesa)**: The passage states ""...正在前往巴拉望的普林塞萨港的途中 (is on its way to Puerto Princesa in Palawan)."" This is true.
*   **C: 它是一艘反水雷舰 (It is a mine countermeasures ship)**: The passage states ""这是一艘复仇者级别的反水雷舰 (It is an Avenger-class mine countermeasures ship)."" This is true.
*   **D: 它属于美国海军第七舰队 (It belongs to the US Navy's Seventh Fleet)**: The passage states ""它属于美国海军第七舰队 (It belongs to the US Navy's Seventh Fleet)."" This is true.
*   **B: 它的基地在巴拉望 (Its base is in Palawan)**: The passage states ""...部署在日本长崎佐世保 (deployed in Sasebo, Nagasaki, Japan)."" This indicates its base is in Japan, not Palawan.

Therefore, option B is the false statement."
谁发表了关于美军的声明？,"The correct answer is **D: 新闻秘书**.

The passage states that ""美国总统唐纳德·特朗普通过新闻秘书发表声明... (US President Donald Trump issued a statement through the press secretary...)"". This indicates the press secretary delivered the statement on behalf of President Trump.
"
根据声明，哪个国家承担了看守被捕武装分子的责任？,"The correct answer is **D: 土耳其**

The passage states: ""The statement said that Turkey would also be taking over the responsibility for the captured ISIS fighters; European countries had refused to repatriate them.""
"
什么被认为是这次坠机的原因？,"The passage states: ""坠机发生在高海拔山区，据称是敌方火力所致."" (The crash occurred in high-altitude mountainous terrain and was reportedly due to enemy fire.)

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: 敌方火力 (Enemy fire)**. While the other options mention contributing factors (mountainous terrain and bad weather hindered the search), the *stated cause* of the crash was enemy fire.
"
坠机发生在什么类型的地形上？,"The correct answer is **D: 山区的**.

The passage states ""坠机发生在高海拔山区"" which translates to ""The crash occurred in high-altitude mountainous areas."" While ""恶劣的"" (B: Harsh) is also mentioned regarding the weather and terrain impacting the search, the question specifically asks about the *type of terrain* where the crash occurred. Therefore, ""山区"" (D: Mountainous) is the most direct and accurate answer.
"
官员们希望洪水会带来什么结果？,"The passage states: ""虽然在洪水过后，水位只会上升几英尺，但官员们希望这足以恢复下游被侵蚀的沙洲。""

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: 沙洲的恢复 (Sandbar restoration)**.
"
大坝建成对以下哪项造成了永久性影响？,"The passage states that the dam, by controlling seasonal floods, stopped sediment from being dispersed into the river. This sediment is essential for forming sandbars and beaches, which are wildlife habitats. As a result, fish species went extinct or became endangered.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: 沙洲 (Sandbars):** The passage directly states that the sediment needed to form sandbars is no longer being dispersed, leading to their erosion. This indicates a permanent impact.
*   **B: 弓背鲑 (Humpback Chub):** The passage mentions the humpback chub is endangered, but doesn't specify if the impact is *permanent*. Endangered species can sometimes recover.
*   **C: 野生动物栖息地 (Wildlife Habitat):** The loss of sandbars and beaches *is* a loss of habitat. However, the officials *hope* that controlled flooding will restore the sandbars. This suggests the impact might not be completely permanent.
*   **D: 沉积物扩散 (Sediment Dispersion):** The dam permanently altered the pattern of sediment dispersion.

Considering the question asks for a *permanent* impact, the best answer is **D: 沉积物扩散**. The dam fundamentally and permanently altered the river's natural sediment flow.
While the sandbars are being impacted, the officials are working on restoring them which suggests that they may be able to be restored over time.
Therefore, the best answer is **D**."
根据这段文字，谁向美国提供了有关可能的袭击的情报？,"The correct answer is **C: 一名不愿公开身份的人士**.

The text explicitly states that the US received information from ""一名不愿公开身份的人士 (a person who wished to remain anonymous)"".
"
以下哪项陈述准确描述了极端分子所谓的袭击计划？,"The correct answer is **C: 在两个国家的地标处引爆炸弹**

Here's why:

* The warning specifically mentions attacks in **both** Kenya and Ethiopia.
* The warning also specifies that the targets are ""**著名地标**"" in both countries.
"
以下哪位不是律师？,"根据原文，萨基斯·科查吉欧格鲁、乔治·尼可拉考普洛斯和马基斯·特里安塔菲洛普洛斯都是律师。而彼得罗斯·曼图瓦洛斯因其办公室成员涉嫌非法贪污受贿而被革职，没有明确说明他是律师。因此，答案是 A。
"
以下哪个人群没有被提到是希腊法律界丑闻的一部分？,"The correct answer is **C: 记者**

The passage mentions the involvement of judges, lawyers, court clerks (法务官), and prosecutors in the scandal. It only mentions journalists as reporting on the scandal, not being involved in the corruption itself.
"
印度输掉几个三柱门？,"The passage states: ""But after the captain lost his wicket, India only managed to score 36 runs losing 7 wickets to end the innings.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: 7**
"
根据这段文字，这一局中最高得分是多少？,"The correct answer is **A: 70 分**.

The text states: ""罗宾·乌萨帕 (Robin Uthappa) 取得了本局的最高分，投出了 11 个四分球和 2 个六分球，仅投出 41 个球便赢得 **70 分**.""
"
以下哪项不是亚当·库尔登感到不满的原因？,"The correct answer is **A: 网站有关性内容的新政策**.

Here's why:

*   **B: 威尔斯删除艺术作品:** The passage explicitly states ""then directly deleted these works of art.""
*   **C: 威尔斯不听他的话:** The passage says, ""then pretended to listen to us.""
*   **D: 有关删除艺术作品原因的谎言:** The passage mentions, ""he [Wales] lied to us from the start. First, he acted like it was for legal reasons.""

Adam Cuerden's complaints were specifically about the *process* of deleting the art (lying about the reasons, not listening). While the new policy about sexual content is *related* because it stems from the same issue (content on the site), it wasn't one of Cuerden's explicit grievances in the interview.
"
根据这段文字，网站上删除了什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 艺术作品**.

The passage states that Adam Cuerden said that Jimmy Wales ""directly deleted the art."" While the passage also mentions sex content, the specific action Cuerden is complaining about is the deletion of art.
"
根据这段文字，阿米尔·可汗不支持以下哪项？,"The correct answer is **A: 让女性选手参加奥运会**.

The passage clearly states that Amir Khan believes ""women should not be competing."" While he supports the British team (and therefore, indirectly, any British female athletes who are part of the team), his core belief is against women's participation in sports.
"
根据这段文字，尽管阿米尔·可汗有个人观点，但他会支持以下哪项？,"The correct answer is **A: 女性选手**.

The passage states that despite his personal belief that women shouldn't compete, he will support British female athletes in the 2012 Olympics.
"
彼得·伦茨是在什么时候去世的？,"The correct answer is **C: 在医院里 (In the hospital)**.

The passage states that Peter Lenz was taken to a local hospital and later died from his injuries there.
"
谁是泽维尔·扎亚特？,"The correct answer is **B: 另一名赛车手** (Another racer).

The passage states that Xavier Zayat was a racer following Lenz who struck Lenz after he fell.
"
在哪种情况下，焦虑的乘客可能会受益于了解飞机的内部工作原理？,"The passage states: ""如果要克服因未知事物或不可控制的状况而产生的恐惧，了解飞机的工作原理和飞行的程序可能会有帮助。""

This directly relates to option B: ""如果他们对飞行的厌恶集中在对未知的恐惧上.""  Understanding the workings of a plane can directly combat the fear of the unknown.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 如果乘客为其恐惧感到丢人** Shame doesn't directly relate to whether knowing about the plane's workings would help. The passage suggests it's *normal* to be afraid, not that shame is the root cause or the solution.
*   **C: 如果乘客厌恶所有类型的交通方式** This is too broad. The passage is specifically about fear of *flying*.
*   **D: 如果他们的焦虑源于与飞行无关的痛苦经历** Knowing about the plane wouldn't necessarily alleviate a fear rooted in a past traumatic event unrelated to flying itself.

Therefore, the best answer is **B**."
根据这段文字，一个注重价格的旅客应该最后做以下哪一项？,"The correct answer is **D: 查看航空公司的网站 (Check the airline's website)**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""...在预订前先比较搜索结果，**同时看看航空公司自己的网站，是有好处的** (Before booking, it is good to compare search results and **also check the airline's own website**)."" This implies checking the airline's website should be the *final* step after comparing prices on other sites.
"
根据这段文字，为了获得最佳的航班价格，旅客应该首先做什么？,"The best answer is **B: 比较不同信息汇集网站上的价格**.

The passage explicitly states that the prices on different aggregation websites can vary significantly and recommends comparing search results before booking. While the passage also suggests checking the airline's website, it's mentioned as something to do *in addition to* comparing aggregation sites, not as the first step.
"
在配送时，何时需要陪同人员？,"The passage states: ""最快的方法就是把它作为托运行李承运。根据航空公司规定，禁止载运未登机旅客的行李，而这时就需要你在场.""

This directly implies that a courier needs to be present (陪同人员) when the goods are sent as checked baggage (托运行李).

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 当物品被作为托运行李发送时 (When the goods are sent as checked baggage)**.
"
根据这段文字，在选择一个联盟中的“飞行常客”航空公司时，应该优先考虑以下哪项？,"The passage suggests that you **shouldn't** just choose the airline you fly most often (C). It emphasizes that airlines within the same alliance offer different benefits and point accrual rates. The passage directly states you should find the airline that will return more points for each flight. While that is not one of the direct options, a focus on the amount of returned points would directly relate to finding an airline that offers more total points overall, suggesting that you should prioritize the airline that offers **A: 提供最多积分的航空公司 (Offering the most points)**.

Therefore, the best answer is **A**.
"
根据这段文字，谁可能会提供更多的飞行常客积分？,"The correct answer is **D: 同一联盟内的不同航空公司**

Here's why:

* **P: 你务必谨慎选择联盟中的”飞行常客“航空公司。 虽然你可能会认为，乘坐哪家航空公司航班的次数最多就加入哪家航空公司的会员是很自然的事，但你应该知道，航空公司提供的权益往往不同，同一联盟下的其他航空公司可能会回馈更多常旅客积分。**

The passage specifically warns against assuming the airline you fly most frequently offers the best rewards. It *explicitly states* that other airlines within the *same* alliance might offer better frequent flyer point accrual.
"
根据这段文字，哪种感觉会受过量饮酒的损害？,"The passage explicitly states that excessive alcohol consumption, especially from illegally produced spirits, can lead to **blindness**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **B: 视觉 (Vision)**"
根据这段文字，哪种措施可能会减轻饮酒的有害影响？,"The passage clearly states that ""excessive alcohol consumption can lead to long-term health problems... and can even lead to blindness and death"" and that ""drinking illegally produced liquor is potentially more dangerous."" It also mentions that ""moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages"" is acceptable and that ""it's important to know your limits"".

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **C: 适量饮酒 (Moderate alcohol consumption)**

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 饮用含甲醇的酒类 (Drinking alcohol containing methanol):** The passage explicitly states that methanol can cause blindness or death.
*   **B: 饮用非法生产的烈酒 (Drinking illegally produced liquor):** The passage warns against this due to the risk of dangerous impurities like methanol.
*   **D: 与不同的人一起喝酒 (Drinking alcohol with different people):** The passage does not mention anything about drinking with different people.
"
阿姆斯特丹的哪个区的房产价值最高？,"The correct answer is **A: 运河区**.

The passage explicitly states that ""该区的房产价值位居该国的最高之列,"" referring to the Grachtengordel (运河区). While the other options may have some connection to the passage, they are not the direct answer to the question of which area has the highest property values.
"
为什么运河区被联合国教科文组织列为世界遗产？,"The correct answer is **A: 它的历史和文化价值 (Its historical and cultural value)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""由于独特的文化和历史价值，整个地区被联合国教科文组织列为世界遗产..."" (Due to its unique cultural and historical value, the entire area was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site...). While the ""unique properties"" in option B are related, the passage clearly stresses the *cultural and historical value* as the direct reason for the UNESCO designation.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪一项使得格罗姆寺值得一去？,"The passage states: ""寺庙阴郁的氛围和洞里萨湖（Tonle Sap）的景色，让人感到爬到山顶是值得的"" which translates to ""The temple's gloomy atmosphere and the views of Tonle Sap make the climb worthwhile.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: 可俯瞰洞里萨湖的景色 (overlooking the views of Tonle Sap)**.
"
根据这段文字，游客进入格罗姆寺需要什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 获取吴哥门票 (Get an Angkor pass)**.

The text explicitly states ""需要购买吴哥门票才能进入圣殿 (An Angkor pass is required to enter the temple).""
"
根据这段文字，以下哪种情况可能会阻止游客前往南极洲？,"The correct answer is **D: 身体活动能力有限 (Limited physical activity ability)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that travel to Antarctica is ""demanding on physical fitness."" This directly implies that someone with limited physical activity ability would be hindered from visiting.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: 旅行预算过多 (Excessive travel budget):** The passage states that travel is ""costly,"" not that having too much money would prevent travel.
*   **B: 只对探索罗斯海感兴趣 (Only interested in exploring the Ross Sea):** The passage mentions that tourist destinations include the Ross Sea, so this wouldn't be a barrier.
*   **C: 允许在十二月至次年一月旅行的工作安排 (Work schedule that allows travel from December to January):** The passage states that travel is possible during the summer months of November to February, which includes December and January. Therefore, this would not be a barrier."
一个对登山感兴趣的旅游者可能会参观南极洲的哪个地区？,"The passage states: ""偶尔会有专门的航空旅行团前往内陆旅行，参加登山活动，或前往南北极的大型基地.""

Therefore, the correct answer is B: 内陆地区.
"
哪里最不可能设有前现代的天文台？,"The correct answer is **C: 偏远地区 (Remote areas)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** 前现代的天文台通常建立在城区或校园内，比现代修建的天文台更容易到达。(Pre-modern observatories were usually built in urban areas or on campuses, which were easier to reach than modern observatories.) and 大多数现代科研望远镜都是巨型设施，位于大气条件优良的偏远地区。(Most modern research telescopes are giant facilities located in remote areas with excellent atmospheric conditions.)

*   This directly implies that pre-modern observatories were *not* located in remote areas. They were built in accessible locations like cities and campuses.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: 容易到达的地方 (Easy-to-reach places):** The passage says pre-modern observatories were *more* accessible than modern ones, so they would likely be in easy-to-reach locations.
*   **B: 城市中心 (City centers):** The passage specifically mentions that pre-modern observatories were often built in urban areas.
*   **D: 大学校园 (University campuses):** The passage also mentions that pre-modern observatories were often built on campuses.

Therefore, the answer is C."
现代科研望远镜可能会被安置在哪里？,"The passage states: ""Most modern research telescopes are giant facilities located in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.""

Therefore, the best answer is **D: 大型设施**
"
根据这段文字，哪个地区最适合安静的沙滩日？,"The answer is **C: 北港区**.

Here's why:

*   **北港区 (North Shore beaches)** are described as having ""沙滩，游泳很安全，大部分地方都有新西兰圣诞树的树荫"" (sandy beaches, safe swimming, and shade from pohutukawa trees). This suggests a more natural and potentially less crowded environment.
*   **塔马基大道 (Tamaki Drive beaches)** are described as being ""有时挤满了度假的家庭，沿岸排列着各种各样的商店"" (sometimes crowded with vacationing families and lined with a variety of shops). This indicates a busier, more developed beach area, which isn't ideal for a quiet day.

Therefore, 北港区 is the better option for someone seeking a quiet beach day."
根据这段文字，哪里的游泳条件可能是最安全的？,"The passage states that the North Shore beaches, which extend from Long Bay to Devonport, are generally safe for swimming. Therefore, the best answer is **D: 长湾 (Long Bay)**, as it's specifically mentioned as part of the area with safe swimming.

While the passage mentions North Harbour (B) containing safe beaches, it's less specific than Long Bay. The passage also mentions that Tamaki Drive beaches in central Auckland (C) are safe, but they are described as potentially crowded. Devonport (A) is the southern end of the safe swimming area, and therefore is less safe than Long Bay.
"
在文中描述的位置参观时，以下哪项行为被认为是不合适的？,"The passage explicitly states:

*   ""不要用大屠杀或纳粹开玩笑"" (Don't joke about the Holocaust or Nazis)
*   ""切勿在建筑物上做标记或涂鸦"" (Do not mark or deface the buildings)
*   ""请给予此地应得的尊严、庄严和尊重。"" (Give this place the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves)

Therefore, the following actions are considered inappropriate:

*   **B: 在某个地方留下标记 (Leaving marks on a place)**
*   **C: 开玩笑 (Joking)**
*   **D: 划伤建筑物 (Scratching buildings)**

Option A (举止庄重 - Behaving with solemnity) is the opposite of inappropriate; it is exactly what the passage encourages.

So, the correct answers are B, C, and D.
"
以下哪项描述了通用语？,"The correct answer is **D: 逐步形成的**

The passage explicitly states that a lingua franca is a ""natural or **gradually formed** language.""
"
哪项陈述不能准确地描述辅助语言？,"根据给定的定义：

*   辅助语言是“为了便于语言不相通的人群交流而创造的人工语言或构造语言。”
*   通用语是一种“自然的或逐步形成的语言，由于各种原因成为其他语言使用者之间交流的主要手段。”

让我们分析每个选项：

*   A: ""它们是用于促进人们之间沟通而逐步形成的语言，否则这些人可能不理解彼此"" - 这描述了通用语，而不是辅助语言。辅助语言是被**创造**的，而不是逐步形成的。 **不准确**
*   B: ""它们既是自然语言又是构造语言"" - 辅助语言是**构造**语言，而不是自然语言。 **不准确**
*   C: ""它们是为了改善难以沟通的情况而构造的语言"" - 这准确地描述了辅助语言。 **准确**
*   D: ""它们是不同语言使用者之间创造的占主导地位的语言"" - 这更接近于通用语，辅助语言不一定成为占主导地位的语言。 **不准确**

因为问题问的是**不能**准确描述辅助语言的选项，A，B，D都是不准确的，但是A和B错误更明显。在通用语和辅助语言的对比关系中，A的错误是把辅助语言当成了通用语。B则是对辅助语言定义的直接错误。因此，B是更合适的答案。

所以，正确答案是： B
"
根据这段文字，如果乘客的航行是在冬天，应该检查什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 客舱位置**.

The passage explicitly states that ""如果在冬天穿越北波罗的海，要检查客舱的位置，因为在冰面上航行会给那些受影响最严重的人带来非常可怕的噪音."" This directly links winter travel in the Baltic Sea to checking the cabin location.
"
根据这段文字，如果乘客的航行是在夏季，他们可能能够避免什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 穿越冰面**.

Here's why:

* The passage mentions that checking cabin location is important because sailing on ice in winter causes terrible noise. This implies that in other seasons (like summer), there would be no ice.
* The passage states that passengers can get a visa exemption, so that does not vary by season.
* The passage states that St. Petersburg cruises include city sightseeing tours. This would not vary by season.
* The passage does not mention cancelling the cruises in St. Petersburg, only that during the winter sailing on ice can be dangerous.
"
为什么加泰罗尼亚语在巴塞罗那的指示牌和广播中经常使用？,"The correct answer is **B: 它是该市的第一官方语言 (It is the city's first official language)**.

The passage states that signs use primarily Catalan ""because it is the legally designated first official language."" The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 它比西班牙语更广为人知 (It is more widely known than Spanish)** - The passage explicitly states that almost everyone understands Spanish, while only about half prefer to speak Catalan.
*   **C: 它是巴塞罗那的首选语言 (It is Barcelona's preferred language)** - While about half the locals prefer Catalan, this doesn't explain the legal requirement for its prominence on signs.
*   **D: 地铁和其他公共设施的使用者多为讲加泰罗尼亚语的市民 (Users of the metro and other public facilities are mostly Catalan speakers)** - The passage doesn't provide information to support this claim."
以下哪种语言是巴塞罗那地铁系统用于定期广播的语言？,"The passage states: ""地铁里的定期广播只有加泰罗尼亚语..."". Therefore, the correct answer is B.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项服务不太可能是高端民宿的重点？,"根据这段文字，高端民宿的竞争重点在于：

*   **床铺:** 奢华的床上用品，如手工制作的被子或年代久远的床榻
*   **早餐:** 当地的时令美食或主人提供的特色菜
*   **场景:** 有历史意义的古老建筑，古色古香的家具，修剪整齐的地面和游泳池

选项 A、B 和 C 都直接对应了这段文字中提到的高端民宿的重点。

选项 D，**快速的 WiFi** 虽然重要，但文中并没有提及，也并非高端民宿在床铺和早餐之外的主要竞争点。因此，它不太可能是高端民宿的重点。

所以答案是 **D: 快速的 WiFi**

根据这段文字，以下哪项不是豪华民宿之间的主要竞争点？,"The passage explicitly states that luxury B&Bs compete on ""bed and breakfast"". The passage mentions:

*   **High-end bedding:** ""the most luxurious linens, perhaps a hand-stitched quilt, or an antique bed."" This corresponds to option C.
*   **Locally sourced, seasonal breakfast options:** ""Breakfast might include local, seasonal delicacies, or a specialty of the house."" This corresponds to options B and D.

The passage does **not** mention modern decor as a point of competition. It mentions antique furniture and historical buildings.

Therefore, the answer is **A: 现代装饰 (Modern decor)**."
根据这段文字，以下哪项不会在 2022 年的北京举行？,"The correct answer is **B: 太子城滑雪场比赛**.

The passage states that the other skiing events will be held in the Tai Zicheng ski resort in Zhangjiakou, which is about 220 kilometers away from Beijing. Thus, the answer must be B because it won't be held in Beijing.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项将在 2022 年的北京举办？,"The correct answer is **B, C, and D**.

The text states:

*   **C: 冬季奥运会 (Winter Olympics)**: ""中国北京将成为 2022 年冬季奥运会的主办城市 (Beijing, China will be the host city for the 2022 Winter Olympics).""

*   **D: 闭幕式 (Closing Ceremony)**: ""北京将举办开幕式、闭幕式 (Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies).""
*   **A: 夏季奥运会 (Summer Olympics)**: While Beijing has hosted a Summer Olympics, the text refers specifically to the 2022 *Winter* Olympics.
"
谁最容易感染禽流感？,"根据原文，""大多数病例出自与家禽打交道的人群，但观鸟者也有一定风险。"" 因此，养禽场工人最容易感染禽流感。

所以答案是 **C: 养禽场工人**
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项陈述准确描述了禽流感？,"The correct answer is **C: 观鸟者有感染的风险** (Bird watchers are at risk of infection).

Let's break down why:

*   **A: 只有养禽场工人感染了禽流感** (Only poultry farm workers are infected with avian flu) - The text says ""大多数病例出自与家禽打交道的人群"" (most cases are from people who handle poultry), implying it's not exclusively them.
*   **B: 在人类中报告的病例比在鸟类中更多** (More cases have been reported in humans than in birds) - The text states less than a thousand human cases exist. While the text doesn't provide specific numbers for birds, it is understood that avian flu primarily affects birds and therefore significantly more cases would exist in bird populations.
*   **C: 观鸟者有感染的风险** (Bird watchers are at risk of infection) - The text directly states ""...但观鸟者也有一定风险"" (...but bird watchers are also at some risk).
*   **D: 在人类中报告的所有病例都是致命的** (All reported cases in humans are fatal) - The text says ""...但其中有一些病例是致命的"" (...but some of these cases have been fatal), indicating not all cases are fatal.

Therefore, option C is the only statement that accurately reflects the information provided in the text."
白令海峡连接着什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 北冰洋和波罗的海**.

The passage states: ""白令海峡经由奥内加湖（Lake Onega）、拉多加湖（Lake Ladoga）和圣彼得堡（Saint Petersburg）连接北冰洋和波罗的海"".
"
根据这段文字，为了不打扰乘客，护照可能在哪种交通工具上收取？,"The text specifically mentions that on **nighttime sleeper trains**, the train conductor might collect passports in advance to avoid disturbing passengers' sleep.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: 夜间卧铺列车**.
"
根据这段文字，在某些跨境列车上，什么时候可能会检查你的身份证件？,"The correct answer is **D: 在行驶中的列车上 (In a moving train)**.

The passage states: ""一些跨境列车的查验在车上进行 (Some cross-border trains conduct inspections on the train)"".
"
在新加坡高热带地区居住最可能遇到的问题是什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 中暑**.

The passage mentions ""高温（终年）和强烈的阳光"", which directly relates to the risk of heatstroke (中暑). The other options are contradicted or not mentioned in the passage:

*   **A: 被抢劫** - The passage states Singapore is a ""非常安全的地方"", contradicting the idea of robbery.
*   **B: 无法购物** - The passage mentions ""到达后你几乎可以买到任何东西"", contradicting this option.
*   **D: 迷路** - The passage mentions Singapore is easy to navigate, contradicting the idea of getting lost.
"
谁可能想避免食用德国糕点？,"The correct answer is **A: 对坚果有严重过敏的人 (People with severe nut allergies)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that many German baked goods feature almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Therefore, someone with a severe nut allergy would need to avoid these.
*   The other options are incorrect because:
    *   B: The passage describes German pastries as rich and varied, especially Bavarian ones, suggesting they'd appeal to someone who likes rich desserts.
    *   C: The passage doesn't mention chocolate as a primary ingredient in most German pastries, so someone disliking chocolate could still enjoy them.
    *   D: The passage describes German pastries as sweets, so someone preferring sweet over savory foods is likely to enjoy them."
德国糕点中哪种配料被认为是季节性的？,"The correct answer is **C: 李子 (Plums)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""苹果全年都能用来做点心，夏天还能吃到樱桃和李子 (Apples can be used in desserts all year round, and in summer you can also find cherries and plums).""
*   This indicates that plums are seasonal (available in the summer).
*   The passage mentions that many German baked goods also feature almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts without stating that they are seasonal.
*   Apples can be used all year round, according to the text."
根据这段文字，以下哪项建议不适合穷游？,"The passage explicitly states that the ""minimum budget travel guide"" assumes travelers will not ""beg"" (向人们要钱). While the passage mentions working (零工) as a separate category and focusing on minimizing expenses (削减开支), it directly prohibits begging. Being flexible on comfort (对旅行的舒适度有弹性) is also aligned with the idea of minimizing expenses.

Therefore, the answer is **C: 向人们要钱**.
"
根据这段文字，谁在极其有限的预算下旅行可能会比较困难？,"The passage says that minimizing expenses to near zero requires sacrificing comfort, time, and embracing surprise. It is also assumed that the traveler will not resort to illegal activities to achieve their goals.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: 喜欢接受挑战的人 (People who like to accept challenges):** The passage mentions ""挑战自我 (challenge yourself)"" as one of the reasons to travel on a budget. This kind of people are more likely to take the challenge of travelling with minimal budget.

*   **B: 没有严格的时间限制的人 (People who don't have strict time limits):** The passage mentions ""愿意牺牲...时间 (willing to sacrifice... time)"". So those with more time available have a better chance of traveling on a budget.

*   **C: 计划在旅行期间远程工作的人 (People planning to work remotely while traveling):** This scenario would fall under the ""边旅行边工作 (work while traveling)"" category, which the passage explicitly states it *won't* focus on.

*   **D: 喜欢遵循行程的人 (People who like to follow an itinerary):** The passage says, ""喜欢充满惊喜的旅行 (like a trip full of surprises)"", implying that budget travel involves a degree of spontaneity and deviation from plans. Those who prefer a strict itinerary and avoid surprises will find budget travel difficult.

Therefore, the answer is **D**.
"
以下哪项陈述没有准确描述从波特马里恩到费尔蒙特的行驶路线？,"The correct answer is **C: 很少遵守限速要求**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states:** ""...严格遵守限速要求的重要性也甚于其他路段。"" This means adhering to the speed limit is *more* important, directly contradicting the idea that speed limits are rarely obeyed.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate:

*   **A: 有漫长的偏远乡村道路** - The passage says the route ""频繁地途径多处偏僻的边远地区.""
*   **B: 车道狭窄** - The passage mentions ""窄车道.""
*   **D: 手机信号应该不是问题** - The passage states ""手机服务比沿途的许多其他路线...要强得多."""
根据这段文字，以下哪项应该是驾驶员在布法罗-匹兹堡高速公路上行驶时的主要关注点？,"The passage emphasizes the following challenges on the Point Marion to Fairmont section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway:

*   **Steep hills, narrow lanes, and sharp turns:** This is the primary focus of the passage, highlighting the demanding driving conditions.
*   **Lower speed limits (35-40 mph):** This reinforces the need for caution and control.
*   **Importance of obeying speed limits:** Emphasizes the dangers of driving too fast.

Considering these points, the main concern for a driver should be **C: Overly fast entry into sharp turns.** The text explicitly warns drivers to be careful due to the turns and to obey the speed limit more strictly in this area.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Being stuck in congested traffic:** The passage doesn't mention traffic congestion. It focuses on the road's physical characteristics.
*   **B: Lack of adequate cell service:** The passage says the opposite - cell service is *better* than other areas along the route.
*   **D: Frequently encountering road construction:** The passage doesn't mention road construction.

Therefore, the best answer is **C**.
"
以下哪项不是开始峡谷探险的必要条件？,"The passage states that canyoneering combines swimming, climbing, and jumping and requires *relatively* little training and fitness compared to other sports.

*   **A: 有游泳能力 (Having the ability to swim)** - Canyoneering combines swimming, so this is necessary.
*   **B: 身体处于最佳状态 (Being in peak physical condition)** - The passage explicitly states that it requires relatively little fitness base to get started. This makes it the least necessary.
*   **C: 跳跃能力 (Having the ability to jump)** - Canyoneering combines jumping, so this is necessary.
*   **D: 少量训练 (Small amount of training)** - The passage states you need *relatively little* training, but it implies some is still needed.

Therefore, the answer is **B: 身体处于最佳状态 (Being in peak physical condition)**.
"
进行成功的峡谷探险可能需要哪些必要条件？,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: 游泳能力**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly mentions that canyoning involves swimming (""溪降结合了游泳、爬山和跳跃的元素"").
*   The text also states that canyoning requires relatively little training compared to other sports like scuba diving. This suggests that option B (曾有水肺潜水的经验) and C (有峡谷探险的认证) are less likely to be necessary.
*   While canyoning does involve climbing and jumping, the text states it requires ""相对较少的训练和体能基础"", so excellent athletic ability may not be completely necessary, but swimming is critical."
根据这段文字，对于计划汽车露营的人来说，什么会有帮助？,"The best answer is **B: 车辆可以让座椅放平**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""如果你有一辆较大的小型面包车、运动型休旅车、轿车或旅行车，并且座椅可以放平，那么你就可以进行汽车露营。"" This clearly indicates that having seats that can be flattened is a key enabler for car camping.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: 对你的车的局限有深刻的了解:** While knowing your car's limitations is generally a good idea for any road trip, the text specifically states this is an advantage of taking your own car for any sort of road trip, not car camping in particular.
*   **C: 一个帐篷:** The passage explicitly states that tents are not ideal when doing the sort of camping car camping is trying to accomplish.
*   **D: 可供露营的私人地产:** The passage states that setting up a tent on private property or in a small town attracts unwanted attention.

Therefore, the most relevant factor mentioned in the text that would help someone planning a car camping trip is having a vehicle with seats that can be flattened."
根据这段文字，如果露营者想保持低调，他们可能要避免什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 在城镇或私人地产上搭建帐篷**.

The passage states: ""在私人地产或任何规模的小镇上搭建帐篷，都很容易引起不必要的注意 (Setting up a tent on private property or in a small town is likely to attract unwanted attention)."" Therefore, to remain discreet, a camper should avoid pitching a tent in these locations.
"
根据这段文字，谁第二次重建了卡萨布兰卡？,"The correct answer is **D: 摩洛哥苏丹 (Moroccan Sultan)**.

The text states: ""摩洛哥苏丹将该市重建为 Daru l-Badya."" which translates to ""The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya.""
"
由于自然灾害，谁放弃了现代城市卡萨布兰卡？,"The correct answer is **B: 葡萄牙人 (Portuguese)**.

The passage states: ""葡萄牙人毁灭了这座城并进行了重建，还将其命名为卡萨布兰卡 (Casa Branca) ，直到 1755 年地震后才遗弃了它."" (The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt the city, naming it Casa Branca, until they abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.)
"
根据这段文字，辛特拉是如何在外国人中获得认可的？,"The correct answer is **C: 拜伦勋爵的好评**.

The text explicitly states ""它是拜伦勋爵笔下为人称道的乐土，并因此为外国人所熟知"" (It is the praised paradise in Lord Byron's writing, and therefore known to foreigners).
"
亚美尼亚没有承认什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 新共和国**.

The passage states that the new republic born out of the war ""没有得到任何国家（包括亚美尼亚）的正式承认"" (was not formally recognized by any country, including Armenia).
"
什么继续影响阿塞拜疆和亚美尼亚之间的关系？,"The correct answer is **C: 外交纷争**.

The passage explicitly states: ""该地区的外交纷争，继续导致亚美尼亚和阿塞拜疆之间的关系恶化"" which translates to ""The diplomatic disputes in the region continue to worsen relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan"".

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: 生活在阿塞拜疆的亚美尼亚人 (Armenians living in Azerbaijan):** While the conflict originates from the Armenian population in Nagorno-Karabakh, the text focuses on the *diplomatic disputes* as the ongoing problem.
*   **B: 1994 年的战争 (The 1994 war):** The war is the historical context, but the question asks what *continues* to affect relations. The war is in the past.
*   **D: 纳戈尔诺-卡拉巴赫地区 (Nagorno-Karabakh region):** The region itself is the *location* of the conflict, but the *diplomatic disputes* *about* the region are what are actively causing the ongoing tension.
"
在夏洛特乘出租车，什么可能会导致额外付费？,"The correct answer is **B: 有三名乘客**.

The passage states: ""乘客超过 2 人则需要额外付费"".  This directly implies that having three or more passengers will result in an extra fee.
"
根据这段文字，带孩子在夏洛特生活的缺点可能是什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 乘出租车**.

The passage states that taking taxis in Charlotte with a family can be expensive (""Passengers exceeding 2 people require additional fees, so this option can be expensive and unnecessary""). This directly points to taxis as a potential drawback of living in or visiting Charlotte with children.

The other options are incorrect because:
* **A: 房价** - The passage doesn't discuss housing prices.
* **C: 其他地区的住户** - Residents from other areas are presented positively in the passage.
* **D: 试图享受这个城市** - The passage highlights the family-friendliness and growth of children's facilities, making this an advantage, not a disadvantage.
"
在西班牙人到达之前，谁控制了智利北部？,"The correct answer is **D: 印加人**.

The passage states: ""在 16 世纪西班牙人到来之前，智利北部受印加统治"" which translates to ""Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, northern Chile was ruled by the Inca.""
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不是在 1810 年发生的？,"The correct answer is **B: 智利取得了对西班牙人的胜利**.

The passage states that Chile declared independence in 1810 but did not achieve decisive victory over Spain until 1818. The other options are all mentioned as facts that happened in 1810 according to the passage."
人们如何才能到达利古里亚地区偏远的村庄？,"The text states: ""村庄靠道路、火车和船只连接起来，开车无法从外面到达这些村庄。"" This means the villages are connected by road (within the villages, presumably), train, and boat, but you can't drive *to* them from elsewhere.

Therefore, the best answer is **C: 乘坐火车或船只** (train or boat).
"
意大利词语“Cinque Terre”指的是什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 五个村庄**

The passage states ""五渔村（Cinque Terre），原意为五块土地，由位于意大利利古里亚（Liguria）地区的五座沿海小村庄..."" which translates to ""Cinque Terre, originally meaning five lands, consists of five coastal villages...""
"
根据这段文字，在潜在的湿滑冬季条件下，哪种靴子最适合？,"The passage recommends boots with studs, low and wide heels, and deep treads (5 mm or 1/5 inch or more). Therefore, the best answer is:

*   **B: 带有鞋钉的靴子**

The passage explicitly mentions boots with studs as being suitable for slippery conditions. The other options describe characteristics that are discouraged (thin/high heels and shallow treads)."
以下哪项不能帮助增加冰雪路面的摩擦力？,"The passage mentions that sand, gravel, and salt are used to increase friction on roads. Water would not increase friction on ice or snow; it would make it more slippery.

Therefore, the answer is **D: 水 (Water)**.
"
以下哪项是夏威夷和库克群岛之间的相似之处？,"The passage states:

*   ""由于和夏威夷处于同一时区，这些岛屿有时被认为是“南方的夏威夷”"" - This indicates that they share the same time zone.
*   ""库克群岛让一些年长的游客联想到建州之前的夏威夷，当时还没有这么多大型观光酒店和其他开发项目"" - This indicates that older Hawaii did not have large hotels.
*   ""库克群岛没有城市，而是由 15 个不同的岛屿组成"" - This indicates that the Cook Islands does not have cities.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: 它们共享相同的时区 (They share the same time zone)."
以下哪项对库克群岛的描述是不准确的？,"The correct answer is **C: 主要城市是拉罗汤加岛和艾图塔基岛**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""库克群岛没有城市，而是由 15 个不同的岛屿组成 (The Cook Islands has no cities, but consists of 15 different islands)."" While Rarotonga and Aitutaki are the main islands, they are not considered cities."
以下哪个护林站提供两种住宿选择？,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

The passage states: ""Sirena is the only ranger station that offers both dorm accommodations and hot meals in addition to camping.""
"
根据这段文字，如果你想使用现金而不是信用卡，你可以在哪里预订公园许可证？,"The correct answer is **B: 希门尼斯港**.

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""可以直接从希门尼斯港 (Puerto Jiménez) 的公园管理处获得入园许可，但不能使用信用卡"" (Permits can be obtained directly from the park headquarters in Puerto Jiménez, but credit cards are not accepted.)

Therefore, Puerto Jiménez is the only location mentioned where you can obtain a permit using cash (since credit cards are not accepted).
"
根据这段文字，哪种滑雪是在较陡峭的地形中进行的？,"The correct answer is **C: 阿尔卑斯式滑雪**.

The passage states that ""阿尔卑斯式滑雪旅行或登山运动 ... 要在陡峭的地形上进行..."".
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项可能有助于想要提高速度的越野滑雪者？,"The answer is **D: 平整的轨道 (Flat trails)**.

The passage states: ""但只有在极少数情况下，你才能获得与不背着沉重背包、**在平整的轨道上**越野滑雪相同的速度。"" This directly implies that flat trails contribute to higher speeds in cross-country skiing.
"
遭遇重返家园冲击的旅行者很难做什么？,"The passage states that travelers experiencing re-entry shock find it hard to ""re-adapt to their native culture.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: 重新适应家乡文化 (Re-adapt to their native culture)**.
"
根据这段文字，哪种旅行者可能更难适应重返家园的冲击？,"The correct answer is **B: 在国外生活时能迅速适应的旅行者 (Travelers who adapt quickly while living abroad)**.

The passage states that it can be *difficult* for travelers who easily adapt to new cultures to readapt to their home culture. The passage directly supports this answer. The other options are not supported by the text.
"
人们应该避免对驼鹿做以下哪种事情？,"The correct answer is **B: 慢慢地接近它们**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Some people don't regard moose as potential dangers and may approach too closely, putting themselves in harm's way.""
* **This directly implies:** People should NOT approach moose too closely. Option B describes approaching moose.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

* **A: 忽略它们的存在:** While ignoring them might be dangerous if you're close, the passage focuses on the danger of getting too close.
* **C: 减少它们的潜在威胁程度:** This is vague and doesn't directly relate to the passage's warning about proximity.
* **D: 在远处观察它们:** This is the *safest* option and aligns with avoiding danger. The passage implies people should keep a safe distance.
"
根据这段文字，关于驼鹿的哪种说法是不正确的？,"The correct answer is **A: 它们是天生具有攻击性的动物 (They are inherently aggressive animals)**.

The passage explicitly states that moose are *not* inherently aggressive (""驼鹿（也被称为麋鹿）天生不具攻击性""). The other options are all supported by the text:

*   **B: 有时它们不被视为潜在的威胁 (Sometimes they are not seen as a potential threat)** - The passage states that ""有些人不把驼鹿当成潜在的危险"".
*   **C: 它们可能会被靠近的人所激怒 (They can be provoked by people who get too close)** - The passage implies this by saying people who get too close put themselves in danger. The danger comes from the moose's reaction.
*   **D: 必要时它们会自卫 (They will defend themselves if necessary)** - The passage states that ""如果感觉到威胁它们也会自卫""."
根据这段文字，以下哪种情况对沙漠旅行者来说最不危险？,"The passage states that chasing mirages is dangerous because it wastes energy and water, and being unprepared for the cold nights leads to hypothermia. Therefore, the least dangerous option is the one that doesn't directly cause either of these problems.

*   **A: 在寒冷的夜晚缺乏保暖衣物 (In the cold nights lacking warm clothing):** This is directly stated as a risk leading to hypothermia.
*   **B: 看到海市蜃楼，产生水的错觉 (Seeing a mirage and developing the illusion of water):** While potentially disheartening, simply seeing the mirage itself isn't inherently dangerous according to the passage. The danger arises from the *pursuit* of the mirage.
*   **C: 在追逐海市蜃楼时浪费精力 (Wasting energy while chasing a mirage):** This is directly stated as a danger in the passage.
*   **D: 在追逐海市蜃楼时浪费水 (Wasting water while chasing a mirage):** This is also directly stated as a danger in the passage.

Since simply seeing the mirage without acting on it is less dangerous than the other options, the answer is B.

**Final Answer: B**
"
文章中未提到以下哪种情况可能对沙漠旅行者构成潜在威胁？,"The correct answer is **D: 晒伤**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 缺水 (Dehydration)**: The passage mentions the importance of not wasting water chasing mirages, implying dehydration is a threat.
*   **B: 海市蜃楼 (Mirages)**: The passage explicitly states that chasing mirages is dangerous.
*   **C: 低体温症 (Hypothermia)**: The passage directly mentions the risk of hypothermia at night.
*   **D: 晒伤 (Sunburn)**: While daytime heat is implied, the passage *doesn't directly mention* sunburn as a potential threat.

Therefore, sunburn is the only option *not explicitly mentioned* as a potential threat in the provided text."
根据这段文字，哪个群体的人口在探险者到来后受到了很大的影响？,"The correct answer is **C: 泰诺人**.

The passage states: ""在欧洲探险者到来后的短短几年里，西班牙征服者就大大削减了泰诺斯的人口"" which translates to ""In the few years after the arrival of European explorers, the Spanish conquerors greatly reduced the population of the Tainos.""
"
根据这段文字，加勒比人说哪种语言？,"The passage states: ""加勒比人 (Caribes) 是讲阿拉瓦克语 (Arawakan) 的民族..."" (The Caribs are Arawakan-speaking people...).

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: 阿拉瓦克语 (Arawakan)**.
"
谁可以被认为是使滑雪成为一项休闲活动的推广者？,"The correct answer is **B: 挪威人**.

The text states that ""in 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia."" This directly implies that Norwegians were involved in promoting skiing as a recreational activity.
"
根据这段文字，滑雪何时首次被认为是一项运动？,"The passage states, ""As a sport, alpine skiing can be traced back to at least the 17th century...""

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: 17 世纪**
"
以下哪项通常与东非海岸最大的岛屿有关？,"The correct answer is **C: 野生动物**.

The passage states: ""马达加斯加是目前为止最大的岛屿，对野生动物来说还是一片独立的大陆."" (Madagascar is by far the largest island and a separate continent for wildlife.) This directly links the largest island (Madagascar) to wildlife.
"
以下哪项不是较小东非岛屿的特点？ ,"The passage states:

*   Smaller islands are mostly independent nations or belong to France.
*   They are known for luxury beach resorts.

It also implies that Madagascar is known for its unique wildlife, setting it apart from the smaller islands.

Therefore, the characteristic that does **not** apply to the smaller East African islands is:

*   **C: 以野生动物著称 (Known for wildlife)**

So the answer is **C**.
"
根据这段文字，某些特别传统的教会如何庆祝复活节？,"The correct answer is **B: 举办周六晚上的守夜**.

The passage states: ""更传统的教堂常常在复活节周末的周六晚上举行复活节守夜活动...""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 举行祈求丰收的仪式:** While the passage mentions the *possibility* that the tradition of watching the sunrise had roots in pre-Christian harvest rituals, it does not state that traditional churches *currently* incorporate this into their Easter celebrations.
*   **C: 为会众举办春季聚会:** The passage doesn't specifically describe the Easter Vigil as a spring gathering in general.
*   **D: 观看日出:** While the passage mentions watching the sunrise, it doesn't explicitly connect this tradition to the practices of traditional churches. It's presented as a separate, potentially older, custom."
为了避免进入厄瓜多尔时的某些要求，古巴公民必须首先拥有什么？,"The best answer is **D: 美国绿卡**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that a Cuban citizen holding a US Green Card should visit an Ecuadorian consulate to obtain a *waiver* to the requirements. This implies that having a US Green Card is the primary way to avoid the normal entry requirements.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: 有护照离出发日期有 6 个月 (A passport valid for 6 months from the departure date)** While this is a general requirement for entry, it doesn't *avoid* the specific requirements for Cuban citizens. It's something everyone needs, regardless.
*   **B: 合法的邀请函 (A valid invitation letter)** The passage states that a valid invitation letter is necessary to enter Ecuador, not to avoid certain requirements.
*   **C: 往返机票以证明停留时间 (A round-trip ticket to prove length of stay)** Similar to passport validity, this is a general requirement mentioned in addition to the specific Cuban citizen rules, not a way to avoid them."
厄瓜多尔的旅行要求不是为了什么而设计的？,"The correct answer is **A: 尽量减少旅客数量 (Minimize the number of travelers)**.

The passage explicitly states the requirements are ""designed to achieve an orderly migration between the two countries."" It also mentions proving the length of stay with a return ticket and the passport validity requirement. Minimizing the number of travelers is not mentioned as a goal.
"
在国外购买以下哪种东西可能比在国内更贵？,"The passage states:

*   ""正品进口镜架可能比在国内购买要贵"" (Genuine imported frames might be more expensive than buying them domestically).

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: 高端镜架 (High-end frames)**.

The passage also explicitly mention ""眼部检查（尤其是医保可以报销的情况下）"", and ""视力保险"" is not mentioned in this passage. The cheaper glasses usually indicate non-brand glasses.
"
在国外购买高端镜架的潜在风险是什么？,"The best answer is **C: 它们可能是假的**

The passage directly states: ""在这些地区买到的高端品牌镜架可能存在两个问题：有些可能是山寨货..."".

While the other options aren't entirely irrelevant (different prescriptions, insurance coverage), they aren't directly highlighted as a potential risk *specifically* of buying *高端镜架* in foreign countries as the passage does with counterfeit products.
"
关于福克兰群岛的货币使用，以下哪项陈述是正确的？,"Let's analyze each option based on the provided text:

*   **A: 在外围岛屿上只有信用卡和英镑被接受** - The text says credit cards *may* not be accepted on outer islands. Both British and US currency *can* be accepted. This statement is incorrect.

*   **B: 斯坦利是唯一接受美元的地方** - The text states that USD *tends* to be accepted in Stanley, *not* that it is the *only* place it is accepted. Also, the text explicitly says British currency is accepted everywhere. This statement is incorrect.

*   **C: 离开福克兰群岛后应该兑换福克兰英镑** - The text states the opposite: it is ""almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency *outside* the islands."" You should exchange it *before* leaving. This statement is incorrect.

*   **D: 除了福克兰英镑外，英镑通常是最被接受的货币** - The text says ""Pound sterling is generally accepted everywhere on the Islands..."" This is the most accurate statement.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D**."
根据这段文字，在从美国前往福克兰群岛时，以下哪个地方使用除信用卡外的支付方式可能特别有用？,"The passage states that credit cards ""may not be accepted"" on the outer islands, but that British and American currency ""can"" be used. This makes C the best answer.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 在 FIC West 商店 (At the FIC West store)** - The passage only mentions that the bank is *opposite* the store. There's no information about payment methods accepted *at* the store.
*   **B: 在所有岛屿上 (On all islands)** - While British/American currency is generally accepted, the passage specifically highlights potential issues with credit card use *only* on the outer islands.
*   **D: 在斯坦利全境 (Throughout Stanley)** - The passage says credit cards and US dollars ""often"" work in Stanley, implying they're generally accepted there.
**Therefore, the correct answer is C.**"
以下哪个事件与寺庙节庆的庆祝活动无关？,"The passage states that temple festivals are held to celebrate ""temple anniversaries, the birthdays of the presiding deities, and other important temple events.""

Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: Elephant's birth:** The passage doesn't mention anything about celebrating the birth of elephants in the context of temple festivals.
*   **B: Temple's anniversary:** The passage explicitly mentions that festivals celebrate temple anniversaries.
*   **C: God's birthday:** The passage mentions that festivals celebrate the birthdays of the presiding deities (gods).
*   **D: Important event related to the temple:** The passage mentions ""other important temple events"" as a reason for celebration.

Therefore, the event unrelated to temple festival celebrations is the birth of an elephant.

**Correct Answer: A**
"
在哪里可以看到装饰华丽的大象？,"The best answer is **C: 在寺庙节庆的游行中**. Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that temple festivals in Kerala often feature processions of decorated elephants.**  Option C directly reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: 从十一月底到五月中旬的各个地方** This is too broad. While festivals happen during this time, it doesn't mean decorated elephants are *everywhere*.
* **B: 在寺庙里** While the festivals occur at temples, the elephants are specifically mentioned as being in *processions* (游行).
* **D: 在喀拉拉邦的街头** While the processions may spill onto the streets, the primary context is the temple festival. The passage emphasizes the temple setting, not just randomly seeing decorated elephants in the streets of Kerala.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项是最有可能在商务舱或头等舱机票上省钱的方法？,"The passage explicitly states: ""一般来说，从 A 地直飞 B 地，压根没必要去找商务舱或头等舱的打折机票。"" (Generally speaking, there's no point in looking for discounted business or first-class tickets for direct flights from A to B.) This implies that finding discounts might be possible in other situations, likely for non-direct flights.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: 通过公司报销 (Through company reimbursement):** While true, the passage presents this as a way to *afford* the expensive tickets, not save money.
*   **B: 预订头等舱而不是商务舱 (Booking first class instead of business class):** The passage indicates that first class is *more* expensive.
*   **D: 寻找折扣 (Looking for discounts):** The passage suggests that looking for discounts on **direct** flights is pointless, implying that you could possibly look for discounts on non-direct flights, which is essentially the idea behind Option C.

Therefore, C is the best answer.
**Final Answer: C**"
根据这段文字，预订某些票价舱位时，搜索什么是浪费时间？,"The correct answer is **C: 折扣 (Discounts)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""一般来说，从 A 地直飞 B 地，压根没必要去找商务舱或头等舱的打折机票。(Generally speaking, for direct flights from A to B, there's really no need to look for discounted business class or first class tickets.)""

This directly implies that searching for discounts on business and first-class tickets for direct flights is a waste of time. While the passage mentions business and first class specifically, the thing you're searching for (discounts) is the wasteful activity. Therefore, discounts is the best answer."
在将非洲总票价与环球旅行票价进行比较时，哪项不需要添加？,"The correct answer is **B: 非洲离境税的费用**.

The passage states to add *extra* visa fees, departure taxes, and ground transportation costs for *regions outside of Africa*. Therefore, you *wouldn't* add the departure tax from Africa when comparing the total cost to a round-the-world ticket.
"
根据这段文字，超市开始提供更多种类的什么选择？,"The correct answer is **A: 成品食品 (Pre-made food)**.

The passage states: ""超市里成品食品的种类越来越多 (Supermarkets are offering more and more varieties of pre-made food)."" While the passage mentions microwaves and affordable restaurants, the *increasing variety* directly relates to pre-made food.
"
超市提供的哪项便利设施可能会吸引购买成品食品的顾客？,"The correct answer is **D: 微波炉**

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically mentions that supermarkets are offering microwaves (or other methods) to heat food. This is a direct convenience related to pre-made food.
*   现场餐厅 is mentioned, but as a feature of some stores *besides* supermarkets.
*   较少种类的选择 is the opposite of the passage point.
*   生食 isn't directly mentioned as a convenience.
Therefore, 微波炉 is the most relevant convenience offered by the supermarket to attract customers purchasing finished food."
哪项可能不为说法语的比利时人和瑞士人所理解？,"The passage states:

*   ""所有说法语的比利时人和瑞士人都会在学校里学习标准法语，所以即使您使用标准的法国度量系统，他们也能听得懂。""

This directly contradicts option A. The other options are described as differences they have, so the answer is **A**.
"
以下哪项在法国与在比利时或瑞士不同？,"The correct answer is **A: 所有单词的发音**.

Here's why:

*   **P** states that only some words have slightly different pronunciations in Belgium and Switzerland, while option **A** claims that all words are pronounced differently.

*   **P** states that standard French metric system is understandable in Belgium and Switzerland, which contradicts the claim that the metric system is different in France than in Belgium or Switzerland.

*   **P** states that standard French is taught in schools in Belgium and Switzerland, indicating it is the same as what is taught in France, which contradicts option **C**.

*   The passage only mentions slight differences in the number system and pronunciation. Spelling is not mentioned, which contradicts option **D**.

Therefore, **A** is the only option that is explicitly supported by the passage."
在哪种情况下你不太可能被提供丧亲票价？,"The correct answer is **C: 如果你从巴黎搭乘汉莎航空公司前往美国** (If you're flying Lufthansa from Paris to the United States).

Here's why:

*   The passage states Lufthansa only offers bereavement fares for flights *from* the US or Canada. Flying *to* the US from Paris would not qualify.
*   The passage explicitly mentions WestJet, Delta, and requiring you to book directly through the airline."
关于丧亲票价，哪项是正确的？,"The correct answer is **D: 它们必须通过电话直接向航空公司预订**

The passage states: ""无论情况如何，你都必须直接打电话向航空公司订票。"" which translates to ""Regardless of the situation, you must call the airline directly to book.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 它们涵盖葬礼出行的费用:** This is incorrect. The passage says they are ""slightly cheaper"" than last-minute flights.
*   **B: 它们必须直接在航空公司网站上预订:** This is the opposite of what the passage states.
*   **C: 它们涵盖临时出行的费用:** This is wrong since they can be used for burial purposes."
什么情况下使用独立的 GPS 设备比 GPS 导航应用更方便？,"The correct answer is **C: 当你将超出服务范围时**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""如果你的手机没有数据连接，或者不在服务范围，手机的性能可能会受限，或者无法使用手机."" This implies that a GPS navigation app is not the best solution when you are out of service range. A dedicated GPS device doesn't rely on cellular data, so it will continue to function in areas without service.
*   The passage notes that using a GPS Navigation App is an alternative to buying a GPS device if you want to save money, but the question is about when the dedicated GPS device would be preferable.
*   Options A, B, and D are reasons why you might choose a GPS Navigation App, according to the prompt, and not when using a dedicated GPS would be easier."
相对于独立设备，使用 GPS 导航应用的一个不好的理由是什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 不需要担心数据连接**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that a drawback of using a smartphone GPS app is that its performance can be limited or unusable if you don't have a data connection or are out of service range.
*   Option A directly addresses this drawback by saying you *don't* have to worry about a data connection, which is the *opposite* of what the passage indicates.
*   Options B, C, and D are all advantages of using a smartphone GPS app, not disadvantages compared to independent devices."
根据这段文字，如何才能确保你匹配到合适的船只？,"The correct answer is **C: 通过专门从事加拉帕戈斯旅游的代理预订**.

The text explicitly states: ""一定要确保你预订行程的代理是一位对各种船只拥有丰富知识的加拉帕戈斯群岛（Galapagos）专家。 这能确保你的某项兴趣和/或约束条件能与最适合他们的船只相互匹配.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 与兴趣相似的 8 名或以上乘客一起预订:** The text does mention boats that hold 8+ passengers, but doesn't suggest booking with people of similar interests is the key to finding the right boat.
*   **B: 在淡季预订:** The text mentions booking early because boats fill up during peak season, but doesn't say booking in the off-season guarantees the *right* boat, just availability.
*   **D: 提前很久预订:** Again, booking early ensures you get a spot, but not necessarily the boat that best fits your needs.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不是用来保持赌客继续赌博的策略？,"The answer is **A: 充足的自然光**.

The passage states that casinos *avoid* windows to disorient patrons. The other options are mentioned as strategies to keep people gambling.
"
根据这段文字，聪明的赌徒应该避免什么？,"根据这段文字，聪明的赌徒应该避免喝太多酒精饮料 (A)。文章中提到醉酒会削弱判断力，而优秀的赌徒需要保持清醒。 因此，A 是最直接的答案。
"
根据这段文字，句子中间的哪个词性要大写？,"The correct answer is **B: 名词**

The passage explicitly states that ""all nouns should be capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence"".
"
根据这段文字，名词的大写可能会使什么更加困难？,"The correct answer is **C: 书写**

The text says ""...although this complicates writing to some extent because you have to judge whether a verb or adjective is being used in a nominalized form."" This directly states that capitalizing nouns (as described) makes writing more complicated.
"
在马来西亚的农村地区，哪个手势表示“过来”？,"The passage states that in rural Malaysia, waving resembles the gesture of beckoning someone with a finger in some Western cultures. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B: 挥手
"
根据这段文字，哪个手势可能意味着“回来”？,"The passage mentions that in Spain, waving goodbye with the palm facing the waver (inward) can be misinterpreted as a gesture for ""come here.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: 手掌向内挥手 (Hand waving with the palm facing inward)**.
"
根据这段文字，什么导致冰裂隙的出现？,"The correct answer is **B: 不稳定的冰川**.

The passage states ""冰川并不是稳定的，而会从山上流下来。这会导致出现裂缝和冰裂隙..."". This directly links the instability and movement of the glacier (从山上流下来) to the formation of crevasses and ice fissures (裂缝和冰裂隙).
"
根据这段文字，以下哪个可能被雪桥掩盖？,"The passage states: ""This leads to cracks and crevasses, which may be covered by snow bridges."" The answer is **A: 裂缝 (Cracks)**.
"
根据这段文字，在参观哪个地方之前，旅行者应该采取额外的预防措施？,"The correct answer is **B: 戈马周边地区 (Goma's surrounding areas)**.

The passage states: ""尽管戈马还算安全，但前往戈马以外的任何地方都应该事先调查，以便了解北基伍省持续的战斗有没有缓和。(Although Goma is relatively safe, travel to anywhere outside of Goma should be investigated beforehand to see if the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province has subsided.)"" This directly indicates that extra precautions should be taken when traveling *outside* of Goma, hence ""Goma's surrounding areas.""
"
以下哪项不是给戈马游客的好建议？,"The correct answer is **A: 北基伍的战斗很有趣**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly warns travelers to investigate the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province before traveling outside of Goma. It implies the fighting is a safety concern, not a source of entertainment.
*   The other options are all supported by the passage.
"
如果计划在八月份的某一天开始野营，什么时候能够获得野地露营许可证？,"The correct answer is **B: 4 月 1 日**.

Here's why:

* The text states permits are issued four months prior to the start month of the trip.
* The trip starts in August.
* Four months prior to August is April.
* Permits are issued on the first day of that month.

Therefore, the permits become available on April 1st.
"
为保护峡谷实施了哪项政策？,"The correct answer is **D: 许可证数量有限**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""为了保护大峡谷，许可证限量发放。"" (To protect the Grand Canyon, permits are issued in limited quantities.) This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 先到先得的许可证系统 (First-come, first-served permit system):** While a portion of permits are available on a first-come, first-served basis for walk-ins, this isn't the overall policy protecting the canyon. The limited number is the main policy.
*   **B: 许可证仅在 1 月 1 日提供 (Permits are only available on January 1st):** This is incorrect. Permits are released four months in advance of the trip month, starting on the first day of that month. So, while January 1st is a key date for May trips, it's not the *only* date.
*   **C: 只有通过未经预约的到访才能获得许可证 (Permits can only be obtained through walk-ins):** This is incorrect. The passage states that there are a limited number of permits reserved for walk-ins, implying that most permits are obtained *before* arriving.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **D**."
以下哪项最不可能出现在文中描述的那种酒店？,"The passage emphasizes the old-world charm, lack of modern amenities, and historical significance of these hotels. Therefore, option D, ""Recently renovated rooms with modern upgrades,"" is the least likely to be found in such a hotel.

So the answer is D.
"
根据这段文字提供的信息，酒店客人最不可能优先考虑以下哪项服务？,"The passage describes hotels catering to the wealthy and famous, emphasizing luxury, historical significance, and high-end dining and entertainment. It mentions ""rich travelers"" and ""high-end restaurants and nightlife."" Therefore, affordability is unlikely to be a priority for guests staying in such hotels.

The other options are supported by the text:

*   **A: 整个酒店都配有古董家具 (Entire hotel furnished with antique furniture):** This aligns with ""traditional equipment"" and ""vintage elegance"".
*   **B: 拥有杰出厨师的餐厅 (Restaurant with an outstanding chef):** This is directly mentioned as ""high-end restaurants"".
*   **C: 提供夜间娱乐活动的休息室 (Lounge offering nighttime entertainment):** This is directly mentioned as ""nightlife venues"".

Therefore, the answer is **D: 房间价格实惠 (Affordable room rates)**.
"
根据这段文字，去格陵兰岛旅游时应该避免什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 称格陵兰的土著居民为“爱斯基摩人” (称格陵兰的土著居民为“爱斯基摩人”)**

The text explicitly states that while the term ""Eskimo"" might be acceptable in the US, it is considered derogatory by many non-Americans in the Arctic, especially Canadians, and should be avoided even if you hear locals using it.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text states ""In Greenland, crime and malicious behavior targeted at foreigners is, overall, virtually unheard of. There are no 'high crime' areas, even in towns.""
*   **B:** The text recommends bringing warm clothing, especially during the colder seasons.
*   **C:** The text emphasizes the good internet connectivity of Greenland."
根据这段文字，以下哪项对于未做好准备的格陵兰游客来说可能成为问题？,"The text mentions:

*   **Weather:** ""严寒也许是没有准备的人将面临的唯一真正的危险。 如果你在寒冷的季节到访格陵兰岛（记住越往北走越冷），一定要带够保暖衣物。"" This clearly indicates that the weather (specifically the cold) is a potential problem for unprepared visitors.
*   **North European mosquitos:** ""在夏季，也要注意北欧的蚊子。虽然这些蚊子不会传播任何疾病，但它们可能会让人感到不适。"" Mosquitoes are a nuisance but not a major danger.
*   **Crime:** ""在格陵兰岛，针对外国人的犯罪和恶意行为总体来说几乎闻所未闻。"" Crime is practically non-existent.
*   **Locals:** There is a risk of offending locals by using the term ""Eskimo""

Therefore, the best answer is **C: Weather**.
"
以下哪项现在被用作中心广场？,"The correct answer is **A: 联盟花园 (Jardín de la Unión)**. The passage states that the Jardín de la Unión ""现在这里成为了中心广场"" (Now it has become the central plaza).
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不会在联盟花园中出现？,"The correct answer is **D: 一个古老的修道院建筑 (An old monastery building)**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 一个有音乐会的中央凉亭 (A central kiosk with concerts)** - The text mentions a central kiosk with free concerts in the afternoons and evenings.
*   **B: 一个古老的爱情传说发生的地方 (A place where an old love legend took place)** - The text explicitly describes Callejon del Beso (Kissing Alley) and its associated love legend.
*   **C: 面向花园的餐馆 (Restaurants facing the garden)** - The text mentions that the garden is surrounded by restaurants.
*   **D: 一个古老的修道院建筑 (An old monastery building)** - The text says the Union Garden used to be the atrium of a 17th-century monastery, and the Temple of Santiago is the only remaining building from it. Thus, a whole old monastery building is not at the Union Garden now.

Therefore, the only thing that *won't* be found in the Union Garden, according to the text, is a whole old monastery building."
根据这段文字，以下哪项关于单日徒步旅行的陈述是不准确的？,"The answer is **D: 有婴儿的家庭不适合进行单日徒步旅行这项户外活动 (Families with babies are not suited to do day hiking as an outdoor activity)**.

The passage states: ""有小孩的家庭可能需要做更多的准备，但即使带着婴儿和学龄前儿童，在户外待一天也不难 (Families with children may need to do more preparations, but it is not difficult to spend a day outdoors even with babies and preschoolers)."" This directly contradicts option D. The other options (A, B, and C) are all supported by the information in the passage.
"
根据这段文字，什么情况下单日徒步旅行需要很少的准备？,"The correct answer is **B: 当涉及较平缓的小径时 (When it involves a relatively flat trail)**.

The passage states: ""沿着一条平缓的小径远足一天几乎不需要什么准备 (Hiking a day on a relatively flat trail requires little preparation)."" This directly links the need for little preparation to a flat trail.
"
罗加兰或阿格德的高原与挪威其他地方的高原有何不同？,"The passage states that the highlands in Rogaland and Agder are colloquially known as ""hei,"" meaning treeless wilderness, usually covered with heather. Thus, the answer is **D: Usually long满石南**.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不是挪威的典型地貌？,"The correct answer is **B: 森林高原**.

Here's why:

*   **P mentions:**
    *   Steep fjords and valleys
    *   High plateaus (vidde), which are vast, open, and treeless
    *   ""Hei"", treeless wastelands often covered in heather.

Therefore, A, C, and D are all mentioned as typical Norwegian landforms. B (森林高原/forest plateaus) is not mentioned and contradicts the description of the plateaus (vidde) as being treeless.
"
对滑雪感兴趣的游客什么时候应该去山中避暑之地？,"The correct answer is **A: 在冬季**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that many hill stations have ""just the right amount of snow"" in winter and offer activities like skiing and snowboarding. Therefore, winter is the ideal time for skiing enthusiasts.
"
根据这段文字，通常什么时候山中避暑之地有最多的游客？,"The correct answer is **C: 在印度的夏季 (In the Indian summer)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""山中避暑之地的旅游旺季通常是在印度的夏季 (The peak tourist season for hill stations is usually during the Indian summer).""
"
如果你想找到一艘寻求帮助的船，你应该避免做什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 无视其他搭船者 (Ignore other hitchhikers)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that you should meet other hitchhikers because they will share information. Ignoring them goes directly against the advice.
*   The passage recommends that you should walk around on the dock. So A is wrong.
*   The passage recommends that you should talk to as many people as possible. If you are talking to them, you are likely to befriend the captain of a ship. So B is wrong.
*   The passage recommends that you can let others know that you can offer your help. So C is wrong.

Therefore, the passage recommends that you should do A, B and C, but not D."
如果你想在港口周围寻找需要帮助的船，应该做什么？,"The best answer based on the prompt is **A: 与水手接触 (Get in touch with sailors)**.

Here's why:

*   The prompt explicitly advises talking to as many people as possible, including those at the bar, which implies sailors. It also suggests approaching those cleaning yachts.
*   The passage clearly wants you to get around and meet people.
*   The passage suggests you will meet them

Therefore, **A** is the most accurate reflection of the prompt's advice."
哪个地点会吸引对该岛殖民历史感兴趣的旅客？,"The correct answer is **A: 北岸**.

The passage states: ""香港岛大部分的城市发展都集中在北岸的填海土地上。 这里是英国殖民者占领的地方，所以如果你想寻找这片领土殖民历史的证据，这里是一个很好的起点."" This directly links the north shore to the island's colonial history.
"
哪个地点会吸引优先考虑迷人景色的游客？,"The passage states: ""若想从最佳角度欣赏香港的美景，可以离开该岛，前往对面的九龙海滨."" This translates to ""If you want to enjoy the best view of Hong Kong, you can leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront opposite.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: 九龙海滨**.
"
一些马鞍的什么特点有助于减少骑手的脚被马镫卡住的风险？,"The correct answer is **B: 安全扣**.

The passage states: ""其次，一些马鞍——尤其是英式马鞍——配有安全扣，如果落马的骑手向后拉，马镫皮带就会从马鞍上掉下来。"" This directly describes how safety stirrups reduce the risk of a rider's foot getting caught.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: 窄鞋底:** While the passage mentions narrow soles, it's in reference to the boots that riders wear, not a feature of the saddle itself.
*   **C: 皮革马镫:** The passage doesn't mention leather stirrups as a safety feature.
*   **D: 更高的稳定性:** This is a benefit provided *by* the stirrups in general, but not a feature that *reduces the risk of getting stuck*."
马靴的哪个特征有助于在使用马镫时提高骑手的安全性？,"The passage states that most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, narrow sole. The question asks which feature of riding boots helps improve rider safety when using stirrups.

Option A mentions a narrow sole, but contradicts the passage by saying it's rough.
Option B is too general, as the passage doesn't mention any specific type of leather of boots.
Option C matches a detail given in the passage.
Option D contradicts the passage by saying it's wide.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 鞋跟 (Heel)**.
"
通过食宿交换网络向旅客提供什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 与当地房东一起的住宿** (With local hosts accommodations).

The passage describes Couchsurfing and accommodation exchange networks as organizations that connect travelers with locals who offer accommodation. The other options are not directly mentioned or are tangential to the core function of these networks.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项关于食宿交换网络的陈述不正确？,"The correct answer is **A: 旅客总是会得到关于当地房东的推荐信息**

Here's why:

*   **B: 一些网络可能需要对旅客进行额外的验证** - The text states ""...尽管有些组织提供或要求额外的验证."" This makes B correct.
*   **C: 旅客将会得到目的地城市中尚有空房的房东的列表** - The text states ""随后会提供一份纸质版和/或在线版名单，将尚有空房的房东一一列出..."". This makes C correct.
*   **D: 旅客有时可以看到对当地房东的评价** - The text states ""...有时会标明其他旅客的推荐和评价信息"". This makes D correct.
*   **A: 旅客总是会得到关于当地房东的推荐信息** - The text states ""...有时会标明其他旅客的推荐和评价信息"". The word ""有时"" (sometimes) indicates that it's not guaranteed, making this statement incorrect.

Therefore, A is the only statement that is not supported by the text."
根据这段文字，哪种类型的客人最不可能出现在共享宿舍房间里？,"The passage states that families with children are rare in hostels, and that some hostels allow them to stay in private rooms. This strongly implies that they are *not* usually in the shared dorms.

The other options are all likely to be in shared dorms:

*   **A: Twenty-something guests:** The passage explicitly states this is the typical client.
*   **B: Solo travelers:** Hostels are often frequented by solo travelers.
*   **D: Thirty-five-year-old guests:** The passage mentions older guests are not uncommon.

Therefore, the answer is **C: 带着小孩旅行的客人 (Guests traveling with children)**.
"
根据这段文字，谁最有可能住在旅舍里？,"The best answer is **B: 三个 22 岁的人一起旅行**

Here's why:

*   **P: 旅舍主要为年轻人提供服务，二十岁左右的年轻人便是其典型客户** This statement makes it clear that the primary target demographic is young adults in their twenties.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: 一对带着新生儿旅行的夫妇:** The text mentions families with children are rare.
*   **C: 一对 70 多岁的夫妇:** The text mentions ""你也可以经常在那里遇到相对年长的人"", meaning they could be there. But they are not the ""typical client"" that the text is describing.
*   **D: 两个带着孩子旅行的家庭:** The text mentions families with children are rare.

Therefore, option B aligns best with the description of a typical hostel guest.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项陈述准确描述了回旋镖投掷？,"The correct answer is **D: 只有一些回旋镖能够返回 (Only some boomerangs are able to return)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""实际上，澳大利亚市面上的大多数回旋镖都飞不回来 (In reality, most boomerangs on the market in Australia do not fly back)."" This directly implies that only *some* boomerangs are designed to return.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 如果正确扔出，它会始终回到你的手中 (If thrown correctly, it will always return to your hand)** The passage doesn't say that *all* returning boomerangs will *always* return if thrown correctly, only that you need the right *type* of boomerang to return.
*   **B: 它在本地人中比在游客中更受欢迎 (It is more popular among locals than tourists)** The passage does not discuss the popularity of boomerang throwing among locals vs. tourists. It only mentions that tourists *want* to learn it.
*   **C: 澳大利亚没有多少回旋镖可供使用 (There are not many boomerangs available in Australia)** The passage implies the opposite. It says that *most* boomerangs in Australia *don't* return, suggesting a high availability of boomerangs in general."
以下哪项主要用于爪哇菜？,"The passage states: ""the Javanese favorites are peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various spices.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 椰子糖 (Coconut sugar)**.
"
根据这段文字，传染病是如何传播的？,"The correct answer is **B: 病原体 (Pathogens)**.

The passage states: ""传染病是由包括病毒、细菌、真菌和其他寄生物在内的**病原体**引起的疾病 (Infectious diseases are diseases caused by **pathogens** including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and other parasites).""

While the passage mentions infected individuals (A) and bacteria (C), it explicitly defines infectious diseases as being caused by pathogens. Vaccines (D) are a preventative measure, not a cause of transmission.
"
根据这段文字，什么不是导致传染病的原因？,"The correct answer is **A: 疫苗**.

The passage states that infectious diseases are caused by pathogens including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and other parasites. Vaccines are used to *prevent* infectious diseases, not cause them.
"
在哪种情况下，选择网页代理而不是个人 VPN 提供商对用户来说是足够的？,"The correct answer is **C: 用户主要是在重新路由 http 流量**.

Here's why:

* **P's argument focuses on VPNs being better than web proxies because they handle *all* traffic, offer better bandwidth/service, and provide encryption.**

* **A: 用户想要重新路由所有流量:** This aligns with VPNs being superior.
* **B: 用户关心的是尽可能规避审查和监视:** VPNs are the better choice due to encryption.
* **D: 用户的活动需要中到高水平的带宽:** VPNs typically offer better bandwidth than web proxies.

* **C: 用户主要是在重新路由 http 流量:** Web proxies are specifically designed for HTTP traffic. If that's all the user needs, a web proxy would be sufficient and a VPN's added features would be unnecessary.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪种关于 VPN 和网页代理的说法是不正确的？,"The correct answer is **D: VPN 只能重新路由 http 流量**.

The passage states that VPNs re-route *all* internet traffic, *not just* HTTP traffic. This directly contradicts option D, making it the incorrect statement. The other options are all supported by the passage.
"
是什么让一个人可以使用其本地区以外的电话公司？,"正确答案是 **A: 通过互联网路由的呼叫**

P 段落的第一句话直接说明了这一点：""因为呼叫是通过互联网路由的，因此你不必使用位于你居住地或旅行地点的通话公司。"" 其他选项虽然可能与情况相关，但并非直接原因。
"
根据这段文字，为了接听某些电话可能需要做什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 购买全球号码**

The passage states: ""很多时候，你必须单独购买一个可以在全球使用的号码，这样才能接听来自公共交换电话网 (PSTN) 电话的呼叫."" This directly supports option A.
"
以下哪项对意大利语单词发音的描述是不准确的？,"正确答案是 **D: 大多数单词的发音是根据以下元音变化的**

原因：

* P 指出 c 和 g 的发音会根据 *后面的* 元音变化，而不是单词本身的发音都根据元音变化。 选项 D 歪曲了原文的含义。

其他选项都可以在原文中找到直接或间接的支持：

* A: “需要确保对 r 和 rr 采取不同的发音” - 直接支持
* B: “大多数单词的发音与拼写完全相同” - 直接支持
* C: “需要注意的主要字母是 c 和 g，因为它们的发音是根据以下元音变化的” - 间接支持，表明 c 和 g 可能造成发音上的困难。
"
伊兹密尔的以下哪些特征起源于现代之前？,"正确答案是 **D: 红瓦屋顶**

段落中指出，红瓦屋顶是与 18 世纪市场、古老清真寺和教堂一同存在的传统元素，因此它们起源于现代之前。 其他选项（宽阔的林荫大道、玻璃外墙的建筑和购物中心）是现代特征的例子。
"
以下哪项不是伊兹密尔的准确特征？,"The correct answer is **B: Its atmosphere reflects traditional Turkey**.

The passage states: ""不过这座城市比传统的土耳其更有地中海欧洲的氛围。"" (However, the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than traditional Turkey.) This directly contradicts option B. The other options are all explicitly stated or implied in the passage.
"
“花见”一词指的是观赏什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 樱花**.

The passage states that ""赏樱，亦称“花见”（hanami）"", which directly translates to ""Cherry blossom viewing, also known as Hanami"". Thus, ""花见"" (hanami) refers to the activity of viewing cherry blossoms.
"
谁主持了第一次观赏樱花派对？,"The passage states: ""在日本，最早的樱花派对是由天皇为他自己和皇室其他贵族成员在皇家御所举办的。"" This translates to ""In Japan, the earliest cherry blossom viewing parties were held by the Emperor for himself and other noble members of the royal family at the Imperial Palace.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 日本的天皇 (Japanese Emperor)**.
"
根据这段文字，哪一项是最不可能吸引游客前往耶路撒冷的原因？,"正确的答案是 **B: 它是以色列的首都**

理由：

*   **A: 该市的宗教意义:** 短文中明确指出耶路撒冷是三大一神教的圣地，这使其成为主要的旅游目的地。
*   **C: 它的文化景点:** 短文中提到耶路撒冷是文化中心。
*   **D: 许多历史遗址:** 短文中提到耶路撒冷有许多历史和考古遗址。
*   **B: 它是以色列的首都:** 短文虽然提到耶路撒冷是以色列的首都，但同时也指出大多数国家和联合国不承认这一点。因此，与宗教意义、文化景点和历史遗址相比，作为首都这一身份不太可能成为吸引游客的主要原因。"
这段文字中没有提到以下哪项是耶路撒冷的著名之处？,"The correct answer is **B: 政治影响**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 引人入胜的历史 (Fascinating History):** The text explicitly mentions ""引人入胜的历史长达几千年之久"" (a fascinating history stretching back thousands of years).
*   **C: 宗教意义 (Religious Significance):** The text states that Jerusalem is a holy city for three major religions and ""是一个真正的精神、宗教和文化中心"" (a true spiritual, religious, and cultural center).
*   **D: 文化景点 (Cultural Attractions):** The text refers to historical, archaeological, and cultural sites, implicitly indicating cultural attractions.

While the text mentions the political controversy surrounding Jerusalem's status as Israel's capital, it doesn't describe Jerusalem itself as being *renowned* for its political influence. The focus is on its historical, religious, and cultural importance."
根据这段文字，哪一类旅行者不会从购买万能卡中受益？,"The correct answer is **B: 只参观克鲁格国家公园的旅行者**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the Wild Card allows access to *some* or *all* South African National Parks.
*   If a traveler only intends to visit Kruger National Park, they would not need a pass that covers multiple parks. They would only need to pay the daily conservation fees and entrance fees for Kruger.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A:** Travelers planning to visit many parks would definitely benefit from the Wild Card.
*   **C:** The passage states that all parks have an entrance fee. Since this traveler is planning to visit the parks anyway, they might as well consider whether the Wildcard would be cheaper than paying individual entrances fees.
*   **D:** Travelers visiting Kruger and at least one other park could benefit from the Wild Card, as it covers multiple parks."
哪项陈述没有准确描述克鲁格国家公园？,"The correct answer is **C: 它是南非国家公园中最小的**.

The passage describes Kruger National Park as a major attraction and the ""flagship"" of SANParks, implying it's a significant park, not the smallest. The other options (A, B, and D) are all directly supported by information in the passage.
"
在山的更陡峭部分，哪一项最有可能对攀登者构成危险？,"The passage explicitly states that ""陡峭的地方要小心谨慎，特别是天气潮湿时，情况有可能很快变得很危险"" (be careful in steep places, especially when the weather is wet, the situation can quickly become dangerous). This directly links ""潮湿的条件"" (wet conditions) to a potential hazard.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   石阶 (stone steps) are part of the path and helpful.
*   小洞 (small hole) is mentioned as a challenge, but not a primary danger.
*   钢缆 (steel cables) are there to provide support and are therefore beneficial.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: 潮湿的条件 (Wet conditions)**."
以下哪一项陈述没有准确地反映文章中描述的马丘比丘山的上坡路？,"The correct answer is **B: 在较陡的部分没有扶手**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 即使是身体状况良好的攀登者也可能喘不过气来** - The passage states ""据说会让人喘不过气来"".
*   **B: 在较陡的部分没有扶手** - The passage states ""在较陡的部分还有钢缆作为支撑的扶手."", which directly contradicts this statement.
*   **C: 你必须通过山顶的一个洞** - The passage states ""必须穿过靠近顶部的一个很低、很狭窄的小洞.""
*   **D: 潮湿时较陡的部分会变得危险** - The passage states ""特别是天气潮湿时，情况有可能很快变得很危险.""

Therefore, only option B is inaccurate according to the text."
根据这段文字，以下哪项不是马略卡岛美食的主要特色？,"The correct answer is **C: 谷物 (Grains)**.

The passage explicitly mentions that Mallorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork). While bread is derived from grains, the passage doesn't state that grains in general are a major component, it specifically mentions bread. The other options (meat, bread, and vegetables) are all directly mentioned as key components.
"
根据这段文字提供的信息，哪项关于 hangi 餐的描述是不正确的？,"正确答案是 **A: 地热窑烤利用用火烧过的石头加热坑洞**

文章明确说明了：

*   Hangi 指的是烧窑美食，坑洞通过用火烧过的石头加热，**在某些地方则是利用地热使地面自然变热。**

选项 A 描述的是用火烧过的石头加热坑洞，而非地热窑烤。地热窑烤是利用地热自然加热。

其他选项都可以在原文中找到对应的信息：

*   B: 使用热石的 hangi 可在惠灵顿找到 - ""在克赖斯特彻奇、惠灵顿和其他地方也可以品尝到其他做法的毛利窑烤。""
*   C: 烤肉大餐经常使用 hangi 烹制 - ""石头火锅经常用于烹饪传统的烤肉大餐。""
*   D: 在罗托鲁瓦可以找到地热窑烤 - ""罗托鲁瓦有几个地方提供地热窑烤 (hangi)"""
以下哪项未被提及作为加热 hangi 坑洞的典型方式？,"正确答案是 **A: 煤气**。

解释：

*   原文提到了使用 **热石 (B & D)** 和 **地热 (C)** 来加热hangi坑洞。
*   原文中没有提到使用 **煤气 (A)**。"
什么可能导致来自一位修道士或修女的特别认可？,"The correct answer is **A: 穿着色彩鲜艳的裹身衣**

The passage states that ""most monasteries will offer wraps for women who are unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in a bright color, the monks at the door might give you a knowing smirk."" This implies a special acknowledgment or reaction (the ""knowing smirk"") based on wearing a brightly colored wrap.
"
以下哪种服装不太可能从修道院借用？ ,"The correct answer is **B: 短裤 (Shorts)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that monasteries lend skirts and trousers to people.
*   The passage states that monasteries lend wraps to women who are not wearing dresses that cover the knees.
*   The passage states that men should wear pants that cover the knees.

Therefore, short pants are the only clothing article that the monastery is unlikely to lend."
游客在访问南极地区时什么时候最有机会看到星星？,"The correct answer is **C: 冬季月份**.

The passage states that polar night, when the sun doesn't rise, occurs in winter. This is when you have the extended darkness needed to view the stars.
"
卫星电话何时不能替代移动电话？,"The correct answer is **A: 如果卫星信号可能不通畅 (If satellite signal may not be clear/available)**.

The passage states: ""一般来说，卫星电话不能取代移动电话，因为只有在卫星信号畅通的室外，才能进行通话."" This directly translates to satellite phones not being a replacement when the satellite signal isn't clear. The other options are related but not the primary reason provided in the text.
"
卫星电话何时比移动电话更可取？,"The passage states: ""In remote areas where cell phone signals do not reach, satellite phones may be your only option. ... This service is often used in shipping, including yachts, as well as expeditions with remote data and voice needs.""

The correct answer is **B: 进行游船旅行期间 (During a cruise trip)**.

*   **A: 在城市度假期间 (During a city vacation)** - This is incorrect because cell phone coverage is generally good in cities.
*   **C: 不需要远程数据时 (When remote data is not needed)** - The passage mentions that satellite phones are useful when remote data is needed, making this the opposite of what is implied.
*   **D: 预计有足够的手机信号覆盖时 (When sufficient cell phone coverage is expected)** - If there's good cell phone coverage, a mobile phone is preferred.
"
以下哪种冲突导致了德涅斯特河沿岸共和国的创立？,"The correct answer is **B: 民族 (Ethnic)**.

The passage explicitly states that Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts, and that this conflict led to the formation of the Transnistria republic.
"
德涅斯特河沿岸共和国与摩尔多瓦其他地区的哪个方面不同？  ,"The correct answer is **C: 联合国认可 (United Nations recognition)**.

Here's why:

*   **C: 联合国认可:** The passage explicitly states that the ""德涅斯特河沿岸共和国"" (Transnistria) ""has its own government and currency, but has not been recognised by any UN member state.""

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: 语言:** The passage says Romanian is the local language and Russian is also widely spoken in Moldova. It doesn't specify whether the same situation is true in the Transnistrian region.
*   **B: 宗教:** The passage indicates that the main religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox, but it doesn't imply that Transnistria is of a different religion.
*   **D: 货币:** Although Transnistria has its own currency, the passage says that despite political negotiation failures, economic links, including using the Moldovan currency, have been rebuilt. Therefore, it is not entirely different."
根据这段文字，如果旅行者希望避免多风天气，他们应该何时访问蒙得维的亚？,"The passage states that in Montevideo, ""winter may feel colder than it looks: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity may make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates."" This implies that winter in Montevideo is characterized by windy conditions.

The question asks when travelers should visit Montevideo to *avoid* windy weather. Since the passage describes wind as being associated with winter, the opposite of winter (summer) would be the time to avoid wind.

Therefore, the best answer is:

*   **C: 北半球的夏季月份 (Northern Hemisphere summer months)** because this corresponds to summer in Montevideo.
"
根据这段文字，如果旅行者偏爱凉爽的气候，他们应该何时访问蒙得维的亚？,"The correct answer is **D: 北半球冬季时**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""蒙得维的亚位于赤道以南，因此北半球冬天的时候，那里是夏天，反之亦然."" (Montevideo is south of the equator, so when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it's summer there, and vice versa.) and ""冬天可能会比看上去显得更冷：温度很少低于零度，但当风和湿度结合在一起，会让人感觉比温度计显示的温度要冷。"" (Winter can feel colder than it looks: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but when wind and humidity combine, it can feel colder than the thermometer reads.)
* **Therefore:** When the Northern Hemisphere is in winter, Montevideo is in summer.  While the passage mentions summers can reach over 30°C, winters are described as cool, though potentially feeling colder than the temperature suggests. The question asks when travelers who like cool climate should visit, not hot climate, so you wouldn't want to visit during the summer.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: 蒙得维的亚夏季时 (Montevideo's summer):** The passage explicitly states temperatures often exceed 30°C during the summer, which wouldn't be ideal for someone who prefers cooler weather.
* **B: 北半球夏季时 (Northern Hemisphere's summer):** This is when it would be winter in Montevideo.
* **C: 蒙得维的亚雨季时 (Montevideo's rainy season):** The passage states there isn't a distinct rainy season, so this isn't a factor to consider.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项与知名涂鸦艺术家有关，而非故意破坏？,"The correct answer is **A: 涂鸦活动**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""涂鸦活动"" exists alongside mature graffiti artists and ""legal"" graffiti walls. This context implies that ""涂鸦活动"" are organized and accepted events, more akin to art than vandalism.
*   The other options (乱写乱涂, 公共财产上不受欢迎的壁画, 难以辨认的标签) are directly associated with the destructive and undesirable aspects of graffiti that the passage contrasts with the more artistic forms."
音乐节的哪个方面被一些参与者认为是体验的重要部分？,"The correct answer is **B: 在现场露营**.

The passage states: ""在一些音乐节，绝大多数参加者选择在现场露营，而且大部分参加者认为这是音乐节体验极为重要的一部分."" This directly supports option B. The other options are mentioned in the text, but not explicitly stated as a vital part of the festival experience for many participants.
"
根据这段文字，如果一个音乐节的参与者想要在靠近音乐的地方露营，他们应该优先考虑什么？,"The text says ""If you want to watch performances up close, you'll need to arrive early and stake out a campsite close to the stage."" This directly supports option D.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: 早点到 (Arrive early)**.
"
根据这段文字，在寻找新墨西哥州北部夜生活时，游客应该避开哪里？,"The correct answer is **B: 小镇酒吧**.

The passage explicitly warns visitors to be cautious of small-town bars in Northern New Mexico due to drunk driving issues. While casinos are mentioned, the passage highlights some of them offer entertainment and drinks, implying they could be a viable (though possibly not ideal, given the context) option for nightlife. Pueblo people are mentioned as living remotely, not as a place to avoid. Malls aren't mentioned at all.
"
根据这段文字，在新墨西哥州北部，游客在哪里最有可能找到知名的娱乐活动？,"The correct answer is **C: 在圣达菲附近的赌场**. Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""almost all casinos listed above serve drinks, and some provide well-known entertainment (mostly the large casinos in close proximity to Albuquerque and Santa Fe)."" This directly connects casinos near Albuquerque and Santa Fe with known entertainment.
*   The passage mentions remote pueblos as being far from nightlife, eliminating B.
*   Casinos 2 hours from Albuquerque are not mentioned, eliminating A.
*   The passage advises against going to small town bars, eliminating D."
预算有限的旅行者可能要避开哪种饮料？,"The passage states that ""果汁价格昂贵，但品质很好."" This indicates that juice is likely to be a budget concern.

Let's analyze the other options:

*   **A: 澳大利亚葡萄酒:** While the passage mentions Australian wine, it doesn't say it's expensive, only that it *might* be more resilient to travel than French wine.
*   **B: 瓶装水:** The passage implies bottled water is readily available, suggesting it's not particularly expensive, especially since the tap water is already safe.
*   **C: 本地啤酒:** The passage describes the local beer as simple and refreshing, with no implication of high cost.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: 果汁**."
根据这段文字所述的地区，以下哪种饮料订单可能会让服务员感到困惑？,"The passage states that ""for Australians, the concept of a 'flat white' coffee is still relatively new."" This means that ordering a flat white would likely confuse the waiter.

Therefore, the answer is **D: 一份“馥芮白”咖啡 (A 'flat white' coffee)**.
"
持续三个世纪的殖民时期是由哪个群体开启的？,"The passage states that the Spanish started a three-century-long colonial period. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D: 西班牙人 (Spanish)
"
根据这段文字，让巴黎人对你产生好感的最佳方式是什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 表现得有礼貌**.

The passage explicitly states that if you show basic politeness, the perceived rudeness of Parisians quickly disappears.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不被认为是巴黎人的刻板印象特质？,"The passage mentions the following stereotypes of Parisians:

*   Self-centered
*   Rude
*   Arrogant

Out of the answer choices, arrogant and rude are explicitly mentioned in the passage. Impolite behavior can be synonymous with being curt or abrupt. Lively or vivacious does not appear to be a stereotype associated with Parisians, according to this passage.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 活泼 (Lively)**."
开普敦 MetroRail 头等舱的好处是什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 没有那么多人**.

Here's why:

*   **B: 没有那么多人:** The passage states ""MetroPlus 更舒适，也没那么拥挤"".
*   **A: 车厢在火车的前面:** The passage states ""前者总是在火车靠近开普敦的那一端"", so this is technically true, but it's about the *location* of the car, not a direct benefit.
*   **C: 比三等舱便宜:** The passage states ""但稍微贵了一点"".
*   **D: 与地铁车票价格相同:** The passage states ""即便如此还是比欧洲的普通地铁票便宜"", which implies it's *not* the same price as a normal metro ticket."
根据这段文字，开普敦的每辆通勤火车都有什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 头等和三等车厢** (Head-end and third-class compartments).

The passage explicitly states: ""每列火车都有 MetroPlus 和 Metro 车厢；前者总是在火车靠近开普敦的那一端."" (Every train has MetroPlus and Metro cars; the former is always on the end of the train near Cape Town.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 一个不那么拥挤的 Metro 车厢** (A less crowded Metro car): The passage says MetroPlus is less crowded, not the Metro car itself.
*   **B: 两个等级的票价相同** (Two levels of the same fare): The passage states that MetroPlus is ""稍微贵了一点"" (a little more expensive).
*   **C: 三个不同等级** (Three different levels): The passage only mentions two levels: MetroPlus and Metro. While Metro is referred to as ""三等舱"" (third-class), there are only two classes."
以下哪项是害虫不太可能做的事情？,"The passage states that pests ""can cause irritating reactions, in more severe cases allergic reactions, spread venom, or infectious diseases."" It also says that dangerous animals that can kill humans are ""usually not included among pests.""

Therefore, the answer is **D: 造成强烈的伤害** because the passage implies pests are less likely to cause deadly harm.
"
预付费电话卡可以在哪里购买？,"The correct answer is **C: 街头小店**

The passage explicitly states that ""每个街头小店都摆满了一排令人眼花缭乱的预付费电话卡"".
"
一些电话卡提供的更好的通话费率是如何使用的？,"The correct answer is **B: 通过免费电话号码**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""通常拨打一个电话号码即可获取这些服务，而大多数的电话都可免费拨打该串号码.""  This directly implies that the special rates are accessed by dialing a free phone number.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 它们只能在特定的国家使用:** While some cards *have* specific country discounts, the question asks *how* the better rates are used. The location of the call doesn't dictate *how* you access the rate.
* **C: 在街头小店购买:** Buying the card is how you *obtain* the service, not *how you use* the better rates.
* **D: 使用付费电话机并支付额外费用:** The passage mentions prepaid phone cards can be used in pay phones, but it doesn't say that using a pay phone is *how* you get the better rates or that it requires extra fees.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪种树在普利特维茨湖国家公园中不太常见？,"The text mentions beech, spruce, and fir as the main tree species in Plitvice Lakes National Park. Oak is not mentioned. Therefore, the answer is B.
"
下列哪种稀有动物可以在普利特维茨湖国家公园中发现？,"The passage states: ""In there can be found rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and *grouse*, as well as many more common species.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: 松鸡 (Grouse)**.
"
根据这段文字，区域码实际上有助于什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 市场控制**.

The passage explicitly states: ""实际上的目的是为了让这些公司更好地控制他们的市场"".
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项是媒体公司编造的有关区域码的谎言？,"The correct answer is **B: 它们有助于避免非法复制**.

The passage explicitly states: ""媒体公司照例撒谎以掩盖其目的，声称这是为了“防止盗版”"" (Media companies routinely lie to conceal their purpose, claiming it's to ""prevent piracy""). This directly contradicts the claim that region codes help avoid illegal copying.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 它们对于获得更多市场控制是必要的** The passage states this is the *actual* reason, not a lie.
*   **C: 它们对于圈钱很有用** The passage states this is the *actual* reason, not a lie.
*   **D: 它们很少有助于防止盗版** While true based on the passage, it's not the specific lie that the passage highlights. The lie is that they *do* help prevent piracy."
回到本国时，哪个程序通常是非正式的？,"The correct answer is **A: 入境检查**

The passage states that ""入境检查...只是走走形式,"" meaning it's usually informal. The other options are related to customs, which the passage says can be difficult.
"
在到达你的本国之前，以下哪些是你应该了解的？,"The correct answers are **B, C, and D**. Here's why:

*   **B: 是否需要申报超过法定限额的物件 (Whether you need to declare items exceeding the legal limit)**: The passage specifically advises to ""declare any objects beyond what the law allows."" This is directly related.
*   **C: 是否会进行海关管制 (Whether there will be customs control)**: The passage states that going through customs ""can be annoying,"" implying customs control will happen.
*   **D: 你携带的任何物件是否不允许入境 (Whether any of the items you are carrying are prohibited from entering)**: The passage advises to ""make sure you know what you can and cannot bring,"" directly addressing prohibited items.

*   **A: 是否会有入境检查站 (Whether there will be entry checkpoints)**: The passage states that entry checkpoints are usually perfunctory or not required, so it's not something you *need* to find out beforehand to prepare for.

Therefore, the most accurate and complete answer, based on the provided passage, is **B, C, and D**.
"
根据这段文字，科茶莫山谷内丰富的什么使得登山者能够不断地发现新路线？,"The correct answer is **D: 峭壁**.

The passage explicitly states: ""来自世界各地的登山者在其绵延不断可作为攀援墙的**峭壁**上不断开拓新路线."" This directly links the discovery of new routes to the abundance of cliffs.
"
根据这段文字提供的信息，谁涵盖了南半球最多的航线？,"The correct answer is **B: 星空联盟**.

The passage states: ""然而，星空联盟涵盖了全球各条航线"". Even though it mentions an exception, it explicitly says Star Alliance covers all global routes, implying it has the most comprehensive coverage, including within the Southern Hemisphere.
"
哪个航空联盟在南半球涵盖的跨洋航线最少？,"The passage states: ""南半球没有一家航空联盟的航线能横跨全部三个大洋（天合联盟甚至没有跨洋航线）."" This clearly indicates that Tianhe Alliance has the least number of transoceanic routes in the Southern Hemisphere.

So the correct answer is D: 天合联盟 (Tianhe Alliance).
"
哪个旅游组织接替了全球跑步之旅？,"The correct answer is **B: Go Running Tours**.

The passage explicitly states: ""全球跑步之旅 (Global Running Tours) 的接替者 Go Running Tours..."" which translates to ""Go Running Tours is the successor of Global Running Tours"".
"
根据这段文字，Go Running Tours 帮助连接多少个不同的跑步旅游组织？,"The correct answer is **C: 几十个** (dozens).

The passage states that Go Running Tours connects ""数十个观光跑运营商"" which translates to ""dozens of sightseeing running operators"".
"
如果游客希望尽可能清晰地看到猎豹，应该怎么做？,"The passage states: ""狮子、猎豹和花豹有时很怕人，用双筒望远镜你能看得更清楚."" This means using binoculars is the best way to see them clearly.

Therefore, the answer is C.
"
根据这段文字，在汽车游猎活动中，游客可能会遇到哪种动物？,"The passage mentions that elephants and giraffes often like to approach cars. Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy. Therefore, the most likely animal from the list to be encountered during a car safari is the giraffe.

So the correct answer is **B: 长颈鹿 (Giraffe)**.
"
根据这段文字，哪种方式可以降低旅游成本？,"The passage suggests forming a group of 4 to 6 people to get a better per-person price. Therefore, the best answer is:

*   **B: 找到一个四人组**
"
根据这段文字，谁可能会获得最优的旅游价格？,"The passage states that a group of 4 to 6 people can get better deals. Of the options provided, only option D, ""five-person group"" falls within this range.

Therefore, the answer is (D).
"
根据这段文字，是什么促成了旧金山的世界知名度？,"The correct answer is **A: 在各种艺术和媒体形式中频繁出现 (Frequent appearance in various art and media forms)**.

The passage states: ""It frequently appears in music, film, literature, and popular culture, making the city and its landmarks world-renowned."" This directly supports option A.

The other options are mentioned in the passage but don't directly explain the city's world-renowned status:

*   **B: 一流的会议场所 (World-class conference venues):** While part of the tourism infrastructure, it's not the primary reason for global fame.
*   **C: 经济多样性 (Economic diversity):** A positive aspect of the city but not the main driver of fame.
*   **D: 新兴的亚洲美食 (Emerging Asian cuisine):** An attraction, but not the core reason for world recognition.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪种关于旧金山的说法不正确？,"The correct answer is **D: 经济完全依赖于旅游业 (The economy is completely dependent on tourism)**.

The passage states that while tourism is important to San Francisco's economy, the economy is also *diverse* and lists other significant sectors like professional services, government, finance, and trade. Therefore, the claim that the economy *completely* depends on tourism is incorrect.
"
根据这段文字提供的信息，哪种类型的旅行者不太可能从旅行社的服务中受益？,"The correct answer is **B: 一个爱突发奇想的旅行者 (A spontaneous traveler)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage highlights the benefits of pre-booking and package deals:** This appeals to travelers who like to plan ahead.
*   **The passage mentions travelers needing visas:** This indicates that travel agencies can assist travelers with the time-sensitive aspects of planning.
*   **The passage discusses reserving bookings for travelers who want to compare prices:** This suggests that agencies are useful for those who need time to think over their choices.

A spontaneous traveler is less likely to value these benefits because they prefer to make decisions on the fly and do not like to pre-book accommodations."
这段文字中没有提到以下哪项是通过旅行社预订的好处？,"The correct answer is **A: 快速获得旅行证件**.

The passage mentions:

*   **C: 一揽子套餐 (一揽子套餐)**: ""旅行社通常会提供包括早餐、机场往返接送的套餐，有的甚至会提供航班和酒店住宿套餐。""
*   **D: 保留预订 (保留预订)**: ""如果需要时间考虑价格是否合适，或者去往目的地需要获取其他证件（如签证），他们可以为你保留预订。""

While the passage does not explicitly mention ""**B: 酒店优惠**"", it does mention that travel agencies work with specific hotels, implying the possibility of negotiated rates or deals.

The passage does not mention anything about travel agencies expediting the process of obtaining travel documents. It only mentions that agencies may be able to *hold* a reservation while you get documents, but not that they help you get them faster.

Therefore, the answer is A.
"
根据这段文字，实时文本翻译应用不能做到什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 100% 准确地翻译**.

The text states that translation engines ""still may get things completely wrong."" This means they cannot guarantee 100% accuracy.  The other options are explicitly mentioned as capabilities of these apps.
"
是什么让翻译可以在离线状态下进行？,"The correct answer is **C: 下载语言数据 (Download language data)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""在下载所需语言数据后，它可以进行离线翻译 (After downloading the required language data, it can perform offline translation)."" This directly links the ability to translate offline to having downloaded the language data.
"
以下哪项不是雪崩的触发因素？,"根据原文：

*   **阳光 (C)**：原文提到“有时起初的触发原因是太阳让雪变暖”
*   **额外的降雪 (D)**：原文提到“有时是因为降雪多了些”
*   **人类 (B)**：原文提到“更常见的原因往往是人为因素”

原文提到雪的粘性是一个条件，使得雪崩需要触发因素才能发生，而不是一个触发因素本身。所以：

正确答案是 **A: 粘雪**
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项是以雪崩的形式下降的？,"The correct answer is **C: 陡峭山坡上的过多积雪 (Steep mountain slopes with excessive snow)**.

The passage states: ""陡坡上所能容纳的雪量有限，多余的雪就会以雪崩的形式坠落 (The amount of snow that a steep slope can hold is limited, and excess snow will fall in the form of an avalanche)."" This directly supports option C.
"
根据这段文字，咖喱的基本成分是什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 香草和香料**

The passage states: ""咖喱饭菜是一道以香草和香料为主的菜肴，并配以肉类或蔬菜.""  (Curry is a dish primarily made with herbs and spices, and served with meat or vegetables.)
"
在某些地区，椰奶有时会代替咖喱中的哪种成分？,"The correct answer is **C: 酸奶**.

The passage states that coconut milk is often used in southern India and other coastal regions, while yogurt is often used in northern India and inland Pakistan. This implies that coconut milk is used as a substitute for yogurt in some regions.
"
为什么绕过横贯南极山脉才能进入高原？,"The correct answer is **C: 专业的拖拉机不够灵活**.

The passage states: ""车子并不是很灵活，所以必须绕着横贯南极山脉，拐一个长长的的大弯才能来到高原."" This directly explains why the tractors must go around the Transantarctic Mountains to reach the plateau - they aren't maneuverable enough to go over them.
"
沿着南极横贯线，有什么用旗帜标了出来？,"The correct answer is **A: 麦克默多站的道路 (McMurdo Station's road)**.

The passage states that the South Pole Traverse is marked with flags: ""雪被压实，缝隙也被填满，并用旗帜做了标记。 (The snow is compacted, crevices filled, and marked with flags.)""

Therefore, the flags mark the road itself, which originates at McMurdo Station.
"
在探索南部非洲时，文章中没有提到游客应该注意什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 几乎所有与南部非洲接壤的国家都是稳定的**

Here's why:

*   **A: 不同的国家对签证的要求不同** - The passage states: ""签证要求和费用因国家/地区而异，并会受到你的国籍的影响。""

*   **B: 开车探索是访问偏远地区的好方法** - The passage states: ""南部非洲非常适合开车旅行，游客既可以欣赏该地区的所有美景，又可以到达常规旅游路线之外的地方。""

*   **D: 如果开车旅行，建议使用四驱汽车** - The passage states: ""强烈建议使用四驱汽车，而且许多地方只有大轴距四驱汽车才能通过。""

*   **C: 几乎所有与南部非洲接壤的国家都是稳定的** - The passage states: ""虽然南部非洲处于稳定状态，但并非所有邻国亦然."" This directly contradicts option C.

Therefore, option C is the correct answer because the passage says the *opposite* of what option C claims."
根据这段文字，对于想要开车探索南部非洲的游客来说，下列哪项会被认为是错误的建议？,"The answer is **B: 尽管建议使用四驱汽车，但大多数地点可以使用普通汽车到达**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""只要细心规划，普通汽车就能做到，但强烈建议使用四驱汽车，而且许多地方只有大轴距四驱汽车才能通过。"" This means a normal car *can* be used with careful planning, but it is *not* true that ""most locations"" are accessible by a normal car. Many places require a 4x4.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: 根据法律可能需要某些车内紧急物品**- The passage directly states: ""每个国家/地区都立有专门法律，对务必放在车内的紧急物品进行了规定。
*   **C: 通过汽车旅行非常适合那些想偏离常规路线的人** - The passage says: ""游客既可以欣赏该地区的所有美景，又可以到达常规旅游路线之外的地方。""
*   **D: 并非所有与南部非洲接壤的国家都适合参观**- The passage says: ""虽然南部非洲处于稳定状态，但并非所有邻国亦然。"" This implies that some neighboring countries might *not* be safe or suitable for visiting.
"
这段文字中没有提到以下哪项是无人看管行李的潜在危险？,"The correct answer is **C: 它们可能会被误认为是别人的**.

The passage explicitly mentions:

*   **A: 它们可能被偷走** (""无人看管的袋子不仅是窃贼的目标"")
*   **B: 你可能会无意中成为运毒者** (""你可能会发现自己被人利用，在不知情的情况下成了一个运毒者"")
*   **D: 当局可能会认为它们是潜在的炸弹威胁** (""还会被当成炸弹威胁"")

The passage doesn't mention that unattended bags might be mistaken for someone else's.
"
关于携带毒品，文中没有提到哪一点？,"The correct answer is **B: 在国际旅行时需要采取额外的预防措施**

Here's why:

*   **A: 在某些国家，初犯可能会被判死刑** - The passage explicitly mentions that some countries have extremely harsh penalties, including the death penalty, even for first-time offenders.
*   **C: 可能会在没有通知的情况下使用缉毒犬** - The passage specifically states that drug-sniffing dogs may be used without prior notice.
*   **D: 当局可能会没收你的行李，即使你没有携带毒品** - The passage mentions that unattended bags can be seen as bomb threats, which will arouse the attention of authorities. Therefore, authorities might search your luggage even if you don't carry drugs.
*   **B: 在国际旅行时需要采取额外的预防措施** - While the passage implies that caution is needed, it doesn't explicitly state that *extra* precautions are needed specifically for international travel. The advice applies broadly to carrying items for others, especially at borders (which would include international borders, but isn't limited to them).

"
哪种饮品没有被提到是在居家度假期间可以尝试在家里制作的？,"The correct answer is **C: 啤酒**.

The passage mentions making coffee, tea, fruit juice, and smoothies. It does not mention making beer at home.
"
如果你所在的城市以饮酒文化闻名，那么在家度假期间你应该参观以下哪里？,"The correct answer is **C: 你不常去的酒吧**.

The passage suggests exploring the drinking culture of your city by visiting bars and pubs you don't usually go to. This aligns directly with the idea of experiencing something new and different during your staycation. The other options are based on the other activities, not the drinking culture of the city.
"
鸽子雕塑位于哪里？,"The correct answer is **B: 在教堂墓地里** (In the church graveyard).

The passage explicitly states: ""教堂墓地里，一些坟墓上方摆着有趣的大理石鸽子雕塑."" (In the church graveyard, some graves are decorated with interesting marble pigeon sculptures.)
"
哪种类型的签证可能需要提供足够的资金支持证明？,"The correct answer is **D: 学生签证**.

The passage states: ""In most countries, you need a letter of acceptance from the school you plan to attend, as well as documentation showing you have funds to cover at least your first year of studies"" when discussing student visas. This directly implies that a student visa application requires proof of sufficient funds.
"
谁最有可能需要延长签证？,"The passage states that students studying abroad usually need to stay longer than tourists or business travelers, and longer stays often require visas. Therefore, the most likely person to need an extended visa is an international student.

The correct answer is **C: 一位国际学生 (An international student)**.
"
你应该在什么时候特别注意蚊子？,"The passage mentions mosquitoes being a problem in the following scenarios:

*   **Summer:** ""尤其在夏天...""
*   **Hiking through a rainforest:** ""如果你决定徒步穿越雨林...""
*   **Driving through a subtropical rainforest:** ""如果你正在开车穿越亚热带雨林...""

Therefore, the best answer is **C: 在雨林中**. It is the most comprehensive as it encompasses both hiking and driving scenarios. Option A is also good but it is a component of C. Option B and D are also components of C.
"
根据这段文字，为了避免在开车穿越雨林时被蚊子叮咬，你应该避免做什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 让车门敞开时间过长 (Let the car door open for too long)**.

The passage specifically states that even a few seconds of having the car door open while driving through a subtropical rainforest is enough time for mosquitoes to enter the car. Therefore, avoiding letting the door stay open for too long is the direct action you should take to avoid mosquito bites.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项有关孙德本尔斯的陈述是不正确的？,"The correct answer is **B: 其总面积的一半被沼泽所覆盖**

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""孙德本尔斯的面积为 3850 平方公里，其中约三分之一为水域/沼泽区。"" This means that approximately one-third (not one-half) of the area is water/swamp.

The other options are supported by the text:

*   A:  ""...里面还有一些巨大丛林的遗迹...""
*   C: ""孙德本尔斯 (Sundarbans) 是世界上最大的滨海红树林带...""
*   D: ""据估计，目前该区生活着 400 只皇家孟加拉虎和大约 3 万只梅花鹿。"""
森林的哪一部分位于印度领土之内？,"The correct answer is **A: 孙德本尔斯国家公园 (Sundarbans National Park)**.

The passage states ""印度境内的这部分森林被称为孙德尔本斯国家公园 (The part of the forest that lies within India is called Sundarbans National Park).""
"
根据这段文字，哪一类人最可能至少具有有限的英语语言理解能力？,"The correct answer is **B: 年龄较小的人 (Younger people)**.

The passage states: ""在更多的国家/地区，人们对英语也略知一二，尤其是年轻人。(In more countries, people know a little English, especially younger people.)"" This directly supports option B.
"
根据这段文字，哪种内容会很难发音？,"The correct answer is **B: 地址**.

The passage specifically states: ""In describing addresses this is particularly true because it is often difficult to pronounce them clearly."" While unique accents and local slang (A and D) can also be difficult to understand, the passage directly mentions the difficulty in pronouncing addresses. Option C is incorrect because the passage states that written text is easier to understand than spoken text.
"
根据这段文字，哪种情况是一个计划从城区间公交站乘坐公交车的旅客的理想选择？,"Let's analyze each option based on the given text:

*   **A: 旅客前往贾卡尔，并已事先购买了车票**

    *   The text states that buses to Jakar/Bumthang depart mainly between 06:30 and 07:30.
    *   The text also recommends buying tickets in advance because buses often fill up.
    *   Therefore, this is a good strategy for a traveller to Jakar.

*   **B: 旅客前往布姆唐，并需要在 7 点前离开**

    *   The text states that buses to Jakar/Bumthang depart mainly between 06:30 and 07:30.
    *   Therefore, this contradicts the text, as you wouldn't be able to leave before 7 am to Bumthang.

*   **C: 旅客前往帕罗，并需要在 11 点后离开**

    *   The text mentions that for places like Paro, shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel.
    *   However, it does not specify time restrictions on shared taxi availability.
    *   Thus, this option does not follow the ""ideal"" advice of booking in advance due to full buses and offers an alternative travel option, shared taxis.

*   **D: 旅客前往东部，并在 6:20 之前到达车站**

    *   The text states that buses to the east depart mainly between 06:30 and 07:30.
    *   Arriving at 6:20 am would mean arriving *before* the typical departure window, but might still leave the traveller with a potential wait.
    *   Furthermore, the option does not indicate if the traveller bought the tickets in advance which, according to the text, is advisable.

Based on the analysis, **A** is the best option because it follows the advice of booking in advance for the bus route to Jakar/Bumthang.

**Final Answer: A**"
对于一名想要从城区间公交站前往东部的游客来说，有什么好的建议吗？,"Based on the information provided in the passage, the best answer is **B: 提前购买车票**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""鉴于区间巴士经常客满，建议提前几天购票 (Given that the inter-district buses are often full, it is recommended to purchase tickets a few days in advance).""

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **A: 公交车仅在 8:30 之后发车 (Buses only depart after 8:30 AM)** - The passage indicates that most buses to eastern locations depart between 06:30 and 07:30, which contradicts the statement that buses only depart after 8:30.
*   **C: 许多公交车在全天发车 (Many buses depart throughout the day)** - While the passage says buses run all day, it also notes that the *majority* of buses to eastern locations depart in the early morning. For someone specifically wanting to go east, this is less helpful than the advice to buy tickets early.
*   **D: 共享出租车可能是最明智的旅行方式 (Shared taxis might be the wisest way to travel)** - Shared taxis are recommended for *nearby* locations like Paro and Punakha. The question is about traveling to the *east*, which is a longer distance, making a bus the more appropriate method.

Therefore, the most relevant and helpful advice for a tourist traveling east from the inter-district bus station is to buy tickets in advance."
以下哪个不是对廷巴克图的准确描述？,"The correct answer is **C: 它无法通过飞机到达 (It is not reachable by plane)**.

The passage states: ""今天，虽然廷巴克图的名声使之成为旅游胜地，而且有一个机场... (Today, although Timbuktu's reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport...)"" This directly contradicts option C.

The other options are supported by the passage:

*   **A: 它比该国其他地方更受阿拉伯文化的影响 (It is more influenced by Arab culture than the rest of the country)** is supported by the statement: ""这座城市与该国其他城市形成了鲜明对比，因为它更多的是阿拉伯风格，而不是非洲风格 (The city contrasts sharply with the rest of the country because it is more Arab in style than African).""
*   **B: 它非常贫穷 (It is very poor)** is supported by the statement: ""但这是一个贫穷的城镇 (but it is a poor town).""
*   **D: 它仍然吸引着好奇的游客 (It still attracts curious tourists)** is supported by the statement: ""廷巴克图的名声使之成为旅游胜地 (Timbuktu's reputation makes it a tourist destination)."""
以下有关廷巴克图的哪个事实是正确的？,"The correct answer is **A: 该城市可通过飞机到达 (The city can be reached by plane)**.

The passage explicitly states ""今天，虽然廷巴克图的名声使之成为旅游胜地，而且有一个机场..."" (Today, although Timbuktu's fame makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport...).
"
原定于什么时候举办夏季奥运会？ ,"The correct answer is **D: 2020 年 7 月**

The passage states: ""截至三月末，大多数由于新冠病毒而出台的取消政策并没有延长到 2020 年 7 月——原定奥运会举办时间.""
"
根据这段文字，漏斗状云何时会变成龙卷风？,"The correct answer is **D: 接触地面后 (Contacting the ground)**.

The passage states: ""刚开始时，漏斗状云从雷暴云中向下伸展，当它们接触地面时就变成了“龙卷风” (Initially, funnel clouds extend downwards from thunderstorm clouds, and they become ""tornadoes"" when they touch the ground).""
"
下列哪一项是龙卷风的准确特征？,"The correct answer is **B: 它们常常移动重物** (They often move heavy objects).

Here's why:

*   **A: 它们总是产生大约每小时 100-200 英里的风** (They always produce winds of about 100-200 miles per hour): The passage says the wind is ""often"" in this range, not always.
*   **B: 它们常常移动重物** (They often move heavy objects): This is directly supported by the text, which states that they can throw heavy objects into the air.
*   **C: 它们在接触地面后变成漏斗状云** (They become funnel clouds after touching the ground): The passage states the opposite - funnel clouds extending from the thunderstorm cloud become tornadoes when they touch the ground.
*   **D: 它们是向外推动空气的旋转气流柱** (They are rotating columns of air that push air outward): The passage says they suck air inward, not push it outward.

Therefore, option B is the only one that accurately reflects the information given in the passage."
根据这段文字，旅行者应该从哪里获得有关其目的地城市政治局势的建议？,"The passage states that travel advisories provide a ""brief summary"" that is ""rough, general, and simplistic."" It also mentions that other governments' advice is tailored to their own citizens. While your own government's advice is likely a starting point, the passage doesn't strongly suggest it as the best source for *detailed* political situation advice.

However, the passage doesn't explicitly offer an alternative source. It mainly warns against relying solely on travel advisories or other countries' advisories.  Since none of the answers are explicitly mentioned as being good sources, we must infer from the text which one is the best.

Given the context, the *least bad* option is **D: 从自己的政府 (From your own government)**.  While the passage warns about relying *only* on your government's advice, it's still a logical place to start. It doesn't recommend any of the other options.
"
如果出现旅游警告，外国公民不太可能会遇到什么情况？,"The passage states that travel warnings provide a ""brief overview"" and are ""overly simple"" summaries of the local situation. It explicitly contrasts this with ""more detailed information available elsewhere."" Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: 关于该国政治局势的详细信息 (Detailed information about the political situation in that country)**

The passage implies A and C are possible consequences of a travel warning and B is a description of travel warnings.
"
根据这段文字，哪种旅行最不可能需要旅行社提供预订帮助？,"The passage suggests travel agencies are helpful when:

*   The traveler is unfamiliar with the destination's nature, culture, and language.
*   The traveler is traveling to a low-income country.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Going to a work conference in a city the traveler has been to before.** This option implies familiarity with the destination, making a travel agency less necessary.
*   **B: A budget-specific two-week trip.** The passage mentions travel agencies specializing in specific budget ranges.
*   **C: A trip where language barriers will be encountered.** The passage states that agencies can be helpful when travelers are unfamiliar with the language.
*   **D: A traveler's first trip abroad.** This implies a lack of familiarity with international travel in general, making a travel agency potentially helpful.

Therefore, the trip least likely to need a travel agency is the one where the traveler is already familiar with the destination.

**The answer is A.**"
根据这段文字，在哪种情况下旅行者最能从旅行社的帮助中受益？,"基于这段文字，正确答案是 **B: 当旅行者有兴趣第一次预订特色旅游时**。

以下是原因：

* **文章指出，当旅行者不熟悉目的地或前往低收入国家时，旅行社是很好的选择。** 特色旅游（例如探险旅游、文化旅游等）往往涉及不熟悉的目的地或需要专业知识的活动，因此在这种情况下，旅行社的帮助尤其有价值。
* **选项 A、C 和 D 都与文章中提到的旅行社优势相悖。** 如果旅行者去他们熟悉的家乡、会说当地语言或者熟悉当地文化，他们就不太需要旅行社的帮助。

因此，选项 B 最符合文章中的信息。
"
根据这段文字，什么可以帮助旅行者避免在新地方失望？,"The correct answer is **B: 愿意尝试不熟悉的食物**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states that things like ""礼节、法律、饮食、交通、住宿、标准和语言等等都会与你居住的地方有所不同。""** Therefore, the passage suggests that travelers must be open-minded to differences in culture and customs and it specifically names ""饮食"" as something that might be different. So trying new foods would mean being open to that cultural difference.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 期望与自己来自的地方相似的标准** - The passage explicitly warns AGAINST this, saying things *won't* be like home.
*   **C: 遵守与自己来自的地方相同的法律** - You must abide by the laws of the place you are visiting. Expecting to follow laws you are familiar with isn't safe or respectful.
*   **D: 避免在住宿方面提前进行研究** - Researching is likely beneficial for avoiding disappointment, not avoiding it.

"
根据这段文字的信息，哪种人在去外国旅行时可能会感到失望？,"The correct answer is **C: 心态封闭的人 (People with a closed mindset)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes that many things will be different when traveling abroad (customs, laws, food, etc.).
*   It warns against expecting things to be ""just like home.""
*   It says remembering this helps avoid disappointment or even aversion to local practices.

Someone with a ""心态封闭的人"" (closed mindset) would be unwilling to accept or adapt to these differences. They would likely expect things to be the same as at home and, therefore, be easily disappointed or even offended by foreign ways.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: 喜欢异国美食的人 (People who like foreign food):** These people are *open* to new experiences and would likely enjoy the differences.
*   **B: 追求变化的人 (People who seek change):** Similar to A, these people actively look for new and different experiences, making them less prone to disappointment.
*   **D: 喜欢学习的人 (People who like to learn):** They will probably be eager to understand the different cultures and customs.

Therefore, a ""closed mindset"" aligns perfectly with the passage's warning about those who cannot accept foreign differences."
以下哪项不是给首次访问发展中国家的旅客的建议？,"The correct answer is **B: 在最初几天里，避免在食物上挥霍**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly recommends spending *more* money on Western-style and high-quality food in the initial days to ease the transition. So, avoiding spending on food contradicts the advice given.
*   The other options align with the passage's advice:
    *   A: The passage warns to avoid sleeping on the ground in areas with unknown fauna, implying you should know what animals live there.
    *   C: The passage recommends bringing a camping bed or hammock to avoid snakes and scorpions.
    *   D: The passage suggests spending more on Western-style hotels when you first arrive.
"
在适应发展中国家时，以下哪项没有被提到是值得多花钱的东西？,"The passage explicitly mentions spending extra on Western-style food, high-quality service, and high-quality hotels to help adjust. It advises *against* sleeping on mattresses or pads on the ground, especially while camping, but it does *not* recommend spending extra money on them.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 露营用的床垫或垫子 (Camping mattresses or pads)**.
"
以下哪个选项对于想要保险单虚拟副本但可能没有互联网连接的保险单持有人来说最好？,"The best option for accessing a virtual copy of an insurance policy without internet access is **C: 将一份副本保存在笔记本电脑的内存中 (Save a copy on your laptop's memory)**.

Here's why:

*   **C: 将一份副本保存在笔记本电脑的内存中 (Save a copy on your laptop's memory)**: Saving the document directly on the hard drive/memory of the laptop means you can access it even when you don't have an internet connection.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: 将一份复印件交给旅伴 (Give a copy to a travel companion)**: This relies on your travel companion having the copy available and accessible when you need it, which isn't as reliable as having it yourself. Also, this is a physical copy, not a virtual one.
*   **B: 将一份副本发送到自己的电子邮箱 (Send a copy to your own email)**: You need an internet connection to access your email.
*   **D: 将一份副本存储在“云端” (Store a copy in ""the cloud"")**: You need an internet connection to access cloud storage.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不需要在保险单上显示？,"The passage states the need for:

*   Insurance company's email address (for consultation, authorization, and claims)
*   Insurance company's international phone number (for consultation, authorization, and claims)

The passage *does not* mention needing the policyholder's (insured person's) email address on the insurance policy. Therefore, the answer is D.
"
根据这段文字，哪种底片尺寸反映了最常用的胶片格式？,"The correct answer is **C: 35 mm 底片**.

The passage states: ""标准 35mm 胶片（36x24mm 底片）是最常见的.""  While option D is the exact measurement, option C refers to the standard film that the measurements define. The other options refer to medium format film, which the passage indicates is *not* the most common.
"
以下哪种胶片格式的分辨率与数码单反相机相似？,"The correct answer is **A: 35 mm 胶片**.

The passage states: ""...标准 35mm 胶片（36x24mm 底片）是最常见的...所呈现的分辨率大致与当前的数码单反相机无差."" This directly indicates that 35mm film has a resolution similar to current DSLR cameras.
"
根据这段文字，在开展旅行写作业务时，以下哪项是最后一步？,"The correct answer is **C: 建立自己的网站**.

The passage explicitly states that after gaining experience on a senior travel blog and becoming familiar with online layout and editing, *then* you create your own website. This makes it the final step mentioned.
"
在开始旅行写作业务时，哪种能力有可能首先被完善？,"Based on the text provided, the passage states that the easiest way to start travel writing is to hone your skills on an established travel blog. This implies that **blog writing** is the skill that would be perfected first. After that, familiarity with online formatting and editing would follow, with website creation coming last.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: 博客写作**.
"
在哪种气候下，肠道问题通常很普遍？,"The passage states: ""正如寒冷气候易发呼吸道问题，炎热气候也极易引发肠道问题。""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 炎热气候** (Hot climate).
"
根据这段文字，经常暴露可能导致哪方面免疫力的增强？,"The correct answer is **B: 当地病菌**.

The passage states that being at home and frequently exposed to local germs makes you likely to develop immunity to them.
"
在申根区内旅行的好处是什么？,"The correct answers are **A, B, and C**.

*   **A: 避免多次签证申请 (Avoid multiple visa applications)**: The passage explicitly states: ""有了申根签证，你就不必分别向每个申根成员国申请签证，从而节省了时间、金钱和手续 (With a Schengen visa, you don't have to apply for visas separately to each Schengen member country, saving time, money and paperwork).""

*   **B: 省钱 (Save money)**: The passage explicitly states: ""从而节省了时间、金钱和手续 (saving time, money and paperwork).""

*   **C: 避免多个护照检查站 (Avoid multiple passport checkpoints)**: The passage explicitly states: ""只要你在此区域居留，通常可以直接通过边境，无需再次接受护照检查点的检查 (As long as you reside in this area, you can usually pass directly through the border without being subjected to passport checks again).""

*   **D: 不需要护照 (Don't need a passport)**: This is incorrect. You still need a passport to enter the Schengen area and for identification purposes, even though you don't necessarily need to show it at every border crossing within the zone.

Therefore, the answer is **A, B, and C**."
图坦卡蒙墓里不再能找到什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 财富**

The passage states: ""古墓里的巨额财富已不在墓中，而是转移到了开罗的埃及博物馆。"" (The massive wealth of the tomb is no longer in the tomb, but has been moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.)
"
根据这段文字，哪个温哥华景点对注重价格的旅行者最没有吸引力？ ,"The correct answer is **D: 惠斯勒 (Whistler)**.

The passage states that Whistler is ""expensive"" due to hosting the 2010 Winter Olympics. This directly indicates that it's less attractive to budget-conscious travelers compared to the other options. The other locations are not explicitly described as expensive, or are described as being easily accessible from Vancouver.
"
根据这段文字，哪个景点最有可能为旅行者提供地道的温哥华体验？,"The answer is **A: 宝云岛**. Here's why:

*   The passage describes Bowen Island as a ""true community"" easily accessible from Vancouver, offering activities like kayaking, hiking, and local shops/restaurants. This suggests a more authentic, local experience.
*   Whistler is described as expensive and known for winter sports and mountain biking, but it's also acknowledged that it’s changed due to the 2010 Olympics and now is less of an authentic local experience
*   The other two are mentioned as ways to get to Bowen Island"
根据这段文字，如果旅行者希望寻求无遮挡的景观，他们应该什么时候参观瀑布？,"The passage states: ""In the rainy season (November to March), the water volume is higher and the falls are more torrential...On the other hand, precisely because the water volume is so high, visibility can be blocked by the water, obscuring a full view of the falls!""

This means that during the rainy season (November to March), the view is obscured. Therefore, to get an unobstructed view, travelers should visit outside of the rainy season.

So the correct answer is **D: 雨季外 (Outside of the rainy season)**.
"
根据这段文字，在 11 月至 3 月期间参观维多利亚瀑布有什么好处？,"The correct answer is **C: 壮观的瀑布景观**.

The passage states that during the rainy season (November to March), the water volume is higher, making the falls more powerful (""瀑布也更加湍急""). This implies a more spectacular display. While it also mentions obstructed views due to the water, the primary benefit is the increased power and intensity of the falls.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不建议使用无人机进行拍摄？,"The correct answer is **D: 仅在无人机不容易被察觉的人群拥挤地区拍摄**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""在机场附近或人群拥挤的地方操控无人机升空，是个馊主意"" (Flying a drone near airports or crowded places is a bad idea). Option D describes exactly this scenario.
* **Options A, B, and C:** The passage encourages careful checking of what you can film, getting permits, and researching licenses. These are all recommended precautions.
"
根据这段文字，使用无人机进行拍摄的最佳地点在哪里？,"The correct answer is **D: 在你事先获得许可的区域**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""如果使用无人机，请提前仔细确认可以拍摄的内容，以及需要哪些许可或额外的牌照。"" (If using a drone, carefully confirm what you can film in advance, and what permits or additional licenses are required). This directly supports the idea of obtaining permission beforehand.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: 靠近人群，无人会介意无人机的存在** - The passage specifically mentions that flying a drone near crowds is a bad idea.
*   **B: 在不允许常规摄影的区域** - The passage explicitly says if regular photography isn't allowed, then filming is even less likely to be allowed.
*   **C: 在无人机不易被察觉的繁忙区域** - This option is dangerous and contradicts the passage's emphasis on responsible drone operation."
根据这段文字，关于签证流程的注册要求，以下哪项说法不正确？,"The correct answer is **B: 所有国家都要求向当地政府登记 (All countries require registration with the local government)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""在一些国家..."" (In some countries...), directly contradicting the claim that *all* countries require registration.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

*   **A: 如果你住在旅游住宿设施，可能不需要注册 (If you stay in tourist accommodation, you may not need to register):** The passage states ""在其他情况下，只有住在旅游住宿设施以外的人需要登记"" (...only those staying outside of tourist accommodation need to register).
*   **C: 可能需要去移民办公室 (It may be necessary to go to the immigration office):** The passage states ""这可能需要...去一趟移民办公室"" (This may require...a trip to the immigration office).
*   **D: 在某些地方，当地的旅馆可以处理登记注册手续 (In some places, local hotels can handle registration):** The passage states ""在很多有这样法律的国家，当地的旅馆可以办理登记注册手续"" (In many countries with such laws, local hotels can handle registration)."
以下哪个不是游客可能去办理注册手续的地方？,"The passage mentions the following places for registration:

*   Local police station
*   Hotel (in some cases)
*   Immigration office

The passage does not mention a post office.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 当地邮局 (Local post office)**.
"
哪些人不会从旅行中的志愿服务受益？,"The passage says that volunteering abroad is a good way to save money and stay longer because many placements offer room and board, and some offer a small stipend. It also says that it is not only about giving back.

The passage also says that it is not for people who:

*   are looking for a significant income.

Therefore, the answer is **B: 寻求可观的薪资的人**
"
根据这段文字，海外志愿服务对预算有限的旅行者有什么好处？,"The correct answer is **C: 有时提供食宿**.

The passage states: ""This is also a great way to travel on a budget and stay somewhere longer, as many volunteer jobs provide food and accommodation, and some even a small stipend.""  This directly supports option C.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 几乎总是能拿到工资:** The passage says ""some jobs even a small stipend,"" implying that getting paid is not guaranteed and not ""almost always"" the case.
*   **B: 通常会带来就业机会:** The passage doesn't mention that it leads to job opportunities.
*   **D: 可以帮助你锻炼正确判断的能力:** While the passage does mention developing better judgement, it is not a benefit that relates to a limited budget."
根据这段文字，什么可能不被认为是前往迪斯尼乐园的普通旅行中的“典型”做法？,"The passage describes a ""typical"" Disney trip as:

*   Flying into Orlando International Airport
*   Traveling to a Disney resort hotel
*   Spending about a week at Disney
*   Then returning home

The passage doesn't mention staying outside the Disney property, the other answers, A, C, and D, are all a normal, or ""typical"" part of a Disney vacation, according to the passage.

Therefore, the answer is **B: 在园外的酒店住宿 (Staying in a hotel off Disney property)**.
"
以下哪项关于迪斯尼乐园的陈述不正确？,"The correct answer is **A: 通票可以转让给其他旅客**

Here's why:

*   **P** explicitly states: ""迪士尼却禁止这样做：门票是不可转让的"" (Disney prohibits this: tickets are non-transferable).

The other options are true based on the passage:

*   **B: 有园区住宿** - ""...乘车前往迪士尼园区酒店"" (...taking a vehicle to a Disney resort hotel)
*   **C: 有巴士可用于将旅客从机场运送到园区** - ""...乘车前往迪士尼园区酒店"" (...taking a vehicle to a Disney resort hotel) This implies there's transportation from the airport.
*   **D: 多日通票通常可以在拍卖网站上找到** - ""许多在 eBay 或 Craigslist 等拍卖网站上出售的门票都是部分使用过的多日通票。"" (Many tickets for sale on auction sites like eBay or Craigslist are multi-day passes that have been partially used.)"
根据这段文字，以下哪个问题最可能没有涵盖在专业培训课程或出版物中？,"The passage states:

*   ""应对敌对环境课程"" cover all the issues discussed (which include war zone survival).
*   The courses often involve role-playing and first aid training.
*   War zone survival publications are rare, but wilderness survival books are common.

Based on these points:

*   A, B, and D are all explicitly mentioned as part of the professional training or related to war zone preparation.
*   Wilderness survival is explicitly mentioned as the one NOT being a publication about war zone survival.

Therefore, the answer is **A: 野外生存** (Wilderness survival) because the passage suggests it's more commonly found in general survival publications, not specifically those about war zones."
根据这段文字，以下哪个主题最可能涵盖在专业培训课程中？,"The passage explicitly states that the course will ""cover all the problems discussed here"" and that the training will involve ""role playing, first aid training, and sometimes armed training.""

*   **A: First aid** is directly mentioned as part of the training.
*   **B: War zones** are the context of the training, but not the primary subject.
*   **C: Wild-land Survival** is specifically contrasted with the training: *“Wild-land survival books and magazines are common, but publications on war zone survival are scarce.”*
*   **D: Hostile environments** is a general description of the location and context of the course.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **A: First aid** because it is explicitly listed as a component of the training.
"
根据这段文字，避免潜在受污染水的最佳选择是什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 购买瓶装水**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that filter's effect vary, and boiling water is only effective in some regions.
*   The passage suggests buying sealed bottled water from reputable companies if you have concerns about water contamination. This is presented as a more reliable option than boiling or filtering, especially when you're unsure about the specific contaminants.

Therefore, buying bottled water is the best option presented to *avoid* potentially contaminated water."
根据这段文字，即使对于熟练的游泳者，以下哪项也许几乎是不可能的？,"The passage states, ""Most fatalities are caused by swimming against the current and becoming exhausted, and swimming against the current is unlikely to succeed."" This directly supports the idea that swimming against the current (rip current) is nearly impossible, even for skilled swimmers.

Therefore, the answer is C.
"
如果你被困在水流中，你应该怎么做？,"The correct answer is **A: 尝试通过改变方向来摆脱水流，然后正常游回岸边**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""摆脱湍急水流之后，游回来就没有那么困难了。"" This implies the first step is to escape the rip current. Since swimming against it is difficult, changing direction is the logical way to escape.
*   The passage also states: 逆着水流游泳不太可能成功, so option B is not a possible answer.
* Option C is not an answer because the passage states that ""摆脱湍急水流之后，游回来就没有那么困难了。""
*   D makes no sense because you need to be on the surface to breathe.

Therefore, A is the best answer."
根据这段文字，在哪个地方参观城堡可能是一个值得去的假日游览？,"The correct answer is **C: 在莱茵河谷**.

The passage explicitly mentions ""参观卢瓦尔河谷和莱茵河谷的城堡 (visiting castles in the Loire Valley and Rhine Valley)"". Option C is directly stated.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不会是推荐给在该地区旅行的女性的提示？,"The passage provides the following recommendations for female travelers:

*   Say they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
*   Wear a ring (but not an expensive one).
*   Be aware that cultural differences may lead to actions they consider harassment (being followed, grabbed, etc.).
*   Be firm when rejecting men and stand their ground.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: 避免讨论婚姻状况 (Avoid discussing marital status):** The passage *recommends* a specific statement about marital status (saying they are married), so avoiding the topic altogether is the opposite of the recommendation.
*   **B: 意识到文化差异可能导致当地人强制性的行为 (Be aware that cultural differences may lead to coercive behavior by locals):** The passage says to be aware of actions that might be considered harassment.
*   **C: 避免佩戴华丽的珠宝 (Avoid wearing ostentatious jewelry):** This is directly advised in the text.
*   **D: 必要时坚定果断 (Be firm and decisive when necessary):** This is also directly advised in the text, regarding rejecting unwanted attention.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: 避免讨论婚姻状况 (Avoid discussing marital status)**, because it contradicts the recommendation to claim to be married."
根据这段文字描述的区域，对于女性游客来说有什么有用的提示？,"The correct answer is **D: 在遇到不受欢迎的求爱时，要坚决拒绝男人**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly advises women to be firm in rejecting men, regardless of cultural differences.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 认识到被尾随是不寻常的:** The passage says being followed *is* common, not unusual.
*   **B: 戴一个大戒指表明婚姻状况:** The passage advises wearing a ring, but specifically says not one that looks too expensive.
*   **C: 理解文化差异意味着你应该避免坚持自己的立场:** The passage explicitly states to insist on your boundaries even if there are cultural differences."
根据这段文字，哪种情况可能需要野生动物摄影师使用专业镜头？,"The correct answer is **A: 如果拍摄特别小的生物 (If photographing very small creatures)**.

The passage states: ""...拍摄野生动物通常会用到长焦镜头，不过拍鸟群或微小生物之类的对象则需要其他镜头 (Wildlife photography typically uses telephoto lenses, but other lenses are needed for subjects like flocks of birds or tiny creatures).""

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: 如果照片用于商业目的 (If the photos are for commercial purposes)**: The passage mentions that parks sometimes have regulations for commercial photography, but it doesn't say that commercial use necessitates a specific type of lens.
*   **C: 如果被摄动物怕人 (If the subject animal is afraid of people)**: An animal being afraid of people is a challenge but doesn't specifically dictate a need for a specialized lens. While a long lens can help maintain distance, it's not the only or explicitly stated solution.
*   **D: 如果公园有关于野生动物摄影的特殊规定 (If the park has special regulations regarding wildlife photography)**: Park regulations are a factor to consider but don't directly imply the need for a specific lens type.
"
以下哪种情况在文中没有被提到是野生动物摄影师的潜在挑战？,"The correct answer is **C: 获取所需类型的镜头**.

Here's why:

*   **A: 寻找某些珍稀动物:** The passage states: ""许多珍稀动物很难找到"" (Many rare animals are difficult to find).
*   **B: 应对攻击性动物:** The passage states: ""野生动物有的...具有攻击性"" (Some wild animals...are aggressive).
*   **D: 在潜在的敌对环境中工作:** The passage states: ""环境可能寒冷、炎热或恶劣"" (The environment may be cold, hot, or harsh).

The passage mentions that different lenses are needed for different subjects (e.g., long telephoto for general wildlife, other lenses for birds or small creatures), but it *doesn't* explicitly state that *acquiring* the necessary lenses is a challenge. The challenge mentioned is knowing which lens to use for which subject.
"
以下哪种情况可能最不会给翻越山口的驾车者带来问题？,"The passage discusses problems related to snow, ice, and freezing temperatures that drivers crossing mountain passes in high latitude regions might encounter.

*   **Friction:** The passage explicitly states that low friction is a problem on icy/snowy roads.
*   **Water droplets & Reduced visibility:** The passage mentions snow, blowing snow, water droplets, and ice obscuring visibility.

Traffic congestion, while inconvenient, is not directly caused by or related to ice and snow conditions, unlike the other options. While bad weather *can* lead to traffic jams, the passage focuses on the direct dangers of ice and snow.

Therefore, the answer is **A: Traffic congestion**.
"
关于各个国家的所得税，以下哪个方面可能是保持一致的？,"The passage states that tax rates, structure, and tiers vary greatly between countries. Therefore, none of A, B, or D are consistent. The passage doesn't mention *where* to pay taxes. However, all the examples are that **income tax** is collected by the countries where the work is being done.

Because A, B, and D are wrong, the best answer is one not explicitly mentioned but implicitly contained in the passage:

*   **C: 申报地点 (Reporting location)** - This is implied, as it's suggested the tax is paid to the country where the work occurs.

Therefore, the answer is C."
根据这段文字，如果你在海外工作，但所在地在其他地方，你可能会在哪里申报所得税？,"The correct answer is **C: 在你目前工作的国家** (In the country you are currently working in).

The passage explicitly states that working overseas generally requires paying income tax to the country you are working in. The other options are not supported by the text:

*   **A: 在你通常所在的地方** (In the place you are usually located): The passage mentions working overseas specifically, implying a location different from your usual residence.
*   **B: 美国** (United States): The passage uses the US as an example of a federal country with varying taxes but doesn't imply you'd automatically pay US taxes while working overseas.
*   **D: 在费用最低的地方** (In the place with the lowest fees): Tax obligations are determined by legal requirements, not personal preference for the lowest cost."
以下哪项不是对世界博览会的准确描述？,"The correct answer is **B: 植物展览与艺术和教育展览同时进行**

Here's why:

*   **A: 展品可能展示一个国家的历史或文化** - This is directly stated in the text.
*   **C: 活动可能持续长达六个月** - The text says the events ""usually last between three and six months"".
*   **D: 各国不是必须参与的** - The text implies this because it states countries ""participate,"" which isn't mandatory.
*   **B: 植物展览与艺术和教育展览同时进行** - The text distinguishes between World EXPOs (art and science) and World HORTICULTURAL EXPOs (plants). The text doesn't suggest that both types of exhibits occur at the same EXPO, rather the information states that there are 2 different versions of the World Expo.

"
以下哪项是世界博览会或国际博览会的规则？,"The correct answer is **B: 同一个国家不能每年主办展览**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""虽然理论上世博会可以每年举行一次（只要在不同的国家举办就行），但实际上并非如此"" which implies that the same country cannot hold it every year.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 展品必须展示一个国家的历史和世界问题:** The passage mentions that countries can exhibit both arts and education, demonstrating either world issues or their own country's culture and history, so it's not necessarily both.
*   **C: 活动必须持续六个月:** The passage states the duration is ""通常从三到六个月不等"", so six months is not a requirement.
*   **D: 对于即将举行的博览会，所有国家都必须参与:** The passage does not state participation is mandatory for all countries."
以下哪种做法可能会降低动物攻击的可能性？,"The correct answer is **B: 清理营地的垃圾 (Cleaning up trash in the campsite)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes avoiding attracting animals with smells.** Cleaning up trash removes a source of attractive smells.
* **A: 携带芳香草药 (Carrying aromatic herbs)** - The passage warns about attracting animals with smells, so this would likely *increase* the risk.
* **C: 与狼保持 25 码的距离 (Maintaining a 25-yard distance from wolves)** - The passage says to maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from wolves. This is too close.
* **D: 用食物残渣来阻止动物 (Using food scraps to stop animals)** - The passage explicitly warns against feeding animals.
"
以下哪种情况在文中没有被提及是动物攻击的可能原因？,"The correct answer is **D: 不熟悉人类的动物**.

The passage mentions:

*   **A: 强烈气味:** ""要注意气味会引来熊和其他野生动物"" - This is mentioned.
*   **B: 未能保持距离:** ""每年，数十名游客都会因未能保持适当距离而受伤"" - This is mentioned.
*   **C: 喂食野生动物:** Although not directly stating it causes attacks, the passage advises against feeding wildlife (""我们不应该去喂养或打扰它们""), implying it can lead to problems, including potential attacks.
*   **D: 不熟悉人类的动物:** The passage states ""虽然公园里许多动物都见惯了人类..."", implying that the animals are used to humans. The passage doesn't say that unfamiliarity with humans causes attacks, but rather the opposite.

Therefore, D is the only option not mentioned as a possible reason for animal attacks in the passage.
