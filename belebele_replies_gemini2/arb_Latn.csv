"bena'an 3la alema3elewmat fi alfqrh, ayun men hedh leys methalaan 3la at3alam aletfa'eley?","Based on the information in the paragraph, the correct answer is **B: medres akhetbarat alekfa'h aledraseyh (School achievement tests)**.

Here's why:

*   **The paragraph focuses on scaffolding as a support mechanism for *new* learning experiences.** The examples given (new software, new project) involve active learning and problem-solving where temporary support is helpful.
*   **School achievement tests assess *existing* knowledge and skills.** They are not designed to provide support during a learning process. They are evaluative, not scaffolding.
*   **The other options align with the concept of interactive learning and scaffolding:**
    *   A: bernamej t'eleymey fi bedayh l'ebh alekmebyewter (Educational program in the early stages of computer use) - This could involve built-in tutorials and help, acting as virtual scaffolding.
    *   C: bernamej derash mesteql (Independent study program) - This could incorporate scaffolding elements like assigned mentors or structured resources.
    *   D: medreb dewrey alesghar (Small-group coach) - This involves a person that can provide support and guidane.

Thus, achievement tests don't fit the description of scaffolding provided in the passage."
ay mema yely la yesf bedqh mefhewm at3alam aletfa'eley?,"The correct answer is **C: yu'eref ayedaan basem at3alam aleqa'em 3la alemsherw' (C: It is also known as project-based learning)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage clearly distinguishes scaffolding from project-based learning.** It states that while project-based learning makes learning easier and more engaging, scaffolding *goes beyond* that.  Scaffolding is presented as a *support mechanism*, not a type of learning *itself*.

* **A, B, and D are all accurate descriptions of scaffolding according to the passage:**
    * **A: yemken an yewjed at3alam aletfa'eley afetradeyaan (A: Scaffolding can exist virtually):** The passage explicitly mentions ""Virtual Scaffolds"" within software.
    * **B: hew wesyelh mesa'edh akether men kewnh teryeqh t'elem (B: It is more of a support mechanism than a learning method):** This is the core argument of the passage.
    * **D: yusetkhedm at3alam aletfa'eley letqedyem aled'em fi bedayh tejrebh at3alam (D: Scaffolding is used to provide support at the beginning of a learning experience):** The passage mentions providing support for individuals going through a new learning experience.

Therefore, option C is the only one that misrepresents the definition of scaffolding as described in the text."
"wefqaan llfqrh, ma hey meyzh may sebyes alety yemken an tefyed aletlab aledyen yewajhewn mesheklh fi aleqra'h?","Based on the paragraph, the answer is **C: 3anewan weyb wahed (A single web address)**.

The paragraph states that a key benefit is the ease of access to the page through ""tawfir 3unwan web wa7id faqat, mimma yaj3al min assahl tadhakuriha wa kitabatiha lil tullab alladhina qad yuwajihuna mushkilatan fi istikhdam law7at almafati7 aw fi attahji2a"" (providing a single web address makes it easier to remember and write for students who may have difficulty using the keyboard or spelling). This directly relates to students who struggle with writing, including those who might have difficulty reading.
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ay mema yely lm yekn jez2aan men rad Krushchev 3la a3mal shaghab al 3ummal?","The correct answer is **C: zeyadh khafd al 2ujur (Increased wage cuts)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the workers were protesting against *decreased* wages (khafd al 2ujur). Krushchev wouldn't respond by *increasing* wage cuts; that would only worsen the situation.
*   The passage mentions that Krushchev sent tanks to restore order (B) and allowed some economic demands to be met (D) and allowed for the appointment of a new Prime Minister (A)."
ayun men ataly lm yekn sebbaan a3mal shaghab fi Bolanda?,"The correct answer is **D: ta3yin Wladyslaw Gomulka (appointment of Wladyslaw Gomulka)**.

The passage states that the riots were caused by:

*   **Naqs al ghidha2 (shortage of food)**
*   **Khafd al 2ujur (reduction in wages)**
*   **I7tijaj 3am didda ashhuyu3iyya (general protest against communism)**

The appointment of Gomulka was a consequence *of* the riots, not a cause. Therefore, D is the correct answer."
"wefqaan llfqrh, ay men ataly lm yu2ther 3la al3laqat beyn alSovieti wa al Wilayat al Mutta7ida al amrikiya?","Based on the provided paragraph, the correct answer is:

**B: alara2 7wl Almanya (Opinions about Germany)**

Here's why:

The paragraph explicitly states that Germany was a *common enemy* of both the Soviet Union and the United States during World War II. This common enemy *led* to cooperation between them.  Therefore, differing opinions about Germany were *not* a factor that negatively impacted their relationship *during* the war and immediately after.

The other options are mentioned as contributing factors to the deterioration of their relationship and the start of the Cold War:

*   **A: alakhetlafat aletheqafeyh (Cultural Differences)** - The paragraph mentions that clashes between cultures led to the breakup of countries.
*   **C: al 3amaliat al mutanaqida (Conflicting Operations)** - The paragraph mentions that clashes between operations led to the breakup of countries.
*   **D: almnaz3at almut3aliqh bi alanzimh (Disputes related to systems)** - The paragraph mentions that clashes between systems led to the breakup of countries.

ay mema yely la yesf bedqh alegherd men eresal alenbedat al'esebyh fi jami3 anha' alejsem?,"The passage states that the nervous system maintains balance and helps keep the body safe from potential threats by sending nerve impulses throughout the body.

The question asks which of the options is NOT an accurate description of the purpose of sending nerve impulses throughout the body.

*   **A: ebta2 tadfq aldam (Slowing blood flow):** The passage mentions maintaining blood flow, not slowing it. This contradicts the purpose described in the passage.
*   **B: edarh tadfq aldam (Managing blood flow):** The passage mentions maintaining blood flow, which implies managing it.
*   **C: al7efaz 3la altawazn (Maintaining balance):** The passage explicitly states this as a function.
*   **D: tejneb al thdidat aljsedyh almuhtmaleh (Avoiding potential physical threats):** The passage says it helps keep the body safe from potential threats.

Therefore, the answer is **A: ebta2 tadfq aldam (Slowing blood flow)**.
"
mada yemken al3thwr 3aleh fi hedbh alejyezh?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is:

**A: Meqaber (ma8abir)** and **B: Ma3abed (ma3abid)** and **D: Alharm Alakbar (al-haram al-akbar)**

The text explicitly mentions the presence of:

*   **Maqaber (ma8abir):** ""...walkathyr min al-ma8abir al-9aghyra..."" ( ...and many small tombs...)
*   **Ma3abid (ma3abid):** ""...wamajmw3a min al-ma3abid..."" ( ...and a collection of temples...)
*   **Alharm Alakbar (al-haram al-akbar):** ""...akbaruha al-haram al-akbar..."" ( ...the largest of which is the Great Pyramid...)

Option C is incorrect because only one of the Seven Wonders (the Great Pyramid) is located in Giza."
ma kan alegherd men alharm alakbar?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **B: لتكريم فرعون (Letakrim fer'eren) - To honor the Pharaoh.**

The text explicitly states that the Great Pyramid was built ""to honor the dead Pharaoh Khufu"" (لتكريم الفرعون خوفو).
"
men alems'ewel 3an ma3ereftena balheryeq aledy demr alema3ebed?,"The correct answer is **C: Strabo**.

The text states: ""Dawwan al mu2arre5 2al Yunani Strabo la7eqan 2al 2esem bel shakel al ladhi na3refuhu 7aleyyan"" which translates to ""The Greek historian Strabo later recorded the name in the form that we know it today.""
"
ayun hew jemlh deqyeqh feyma yekhes e'eadh bena' ma3ebed Artemis?,"The correct answer is **B: a'eyed bena'eh b3d 'ehed Alexander alakebr** (It was rebuilt after the era of Alexander the Great).

Here's why:

*   The passage states Alexander offered to pay for the reconstruction but was refused. It also states the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC *after* Alexander's death.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: duf'eِt tekaleyf e'eadh alebna' men qebl Alexander alakebr** (The costs of reconstruction were paid by Alexander the Great) - This is incorrect because the passage explicitly says his offer was refused.
*   **C: aumer Herostratus betghetyh tekaleyf e'eadh alebna'** (Herostratus was ordered to cover the costs of reconstruction) - This is incorrect. Herostratus only destroyed the temple.
*   **D: a'eyed bena'eh fi 3am 320 qebl alemyelad** (It was rebuilt in 320 BC) - This is incorrect. The passage says it was rebuilt in 323 BC."
"wefqaan llfqrh, meta kan abekr weqt yemken an yesyer feyh new' ma 3la qedmeyn?","The correct answer is **A: mundhu sab3 malayn sana**

The passage states: ""3ala arraghm min anna al-Sahelanthropus rubbama yakunu qad sara 3ala qadamayn mundhu sab3at malayin sana."" (Despite that, the Sahelanthropus may have walked on two feet seven million years ago.) This indicates the earliest *possible* time mentioned for a species walking on two feet.
"
ay men hedh alanewa' kan yesyer banetzam 3la qedmeyn?,"Based on the provided text:

*   **P** states: ""Tamma al3uthur 3ala asnaf dhat qadamayn fi 7ifriyat Australopithecus mundhu 4.2-3.9 milyun sana, 3ala arraghm min anna al-Sahelanthropus rubbama yakunu qad sara 3ala qadamayn mundhu sab3at malayin sana."" (Species with two feet have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two feet 7 million years ago.)

*   **B: Homo Erectus** is also mentioned as ""al-insan muntasib alqa2im (ay al-insan mustaqim al-qama)"" which translates to ""upright man"".

*   The question asks, **""ay men hedh alanewa' kan yesyer banetzam 3ala qedmeyn?""** (Which of these types walked regularly on two feet?)

Based on the information, the best answer is:

**B: Homo Erectus**

**Explanation:**

The text indicates that *Homo Erectus* (""upright man"") walked upright. While *Australopithecus* fossils show evidence of bipedalism, the passage implies it was perhaps not as regular or efficient as in *Homo Erectus*. *Sahelanthropus* *may* have walked on two feet, but the text uses ""rubbama"" meaning ""maybe"", implying less certainty.

Even if ""fesa'el dat qedmeyn"" directly translates to ""species with two feet"" since Homo Erectus is a species with two feet that walked regularly on two feet, that would still be the most correct answer.

"
ma aledy hawelt alebheryh alalemaneyh theqyeqh khelal alherb al'ealemyh alethaneyh?,"The correct answer is **D: men' ameryeka men telqey alashekhas walebda'e'** (Preventing America from receiving people and goods).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Fi alwaqti nafsih, kanat alba7riya al almaniya tu7awilu 2iqaf hadhihi al7araka, bi istikhdam ghawwasat U bi shaklin asasy."" This translates to ""At the same time, the German Navy was trying to stop this movement, primarily using U-boats.""
* ""hadhihi al7araka"" (this movement) refers to the American effort to transport men and equipment across the Atlantic to aid Britain.

The German Navy's goal was to prevent the US from delivering supplies and personnel to Britain.
"
"bena'an 3la alema3elewmat alewaredh fi alfqrh, men heqq akebr nejah fi alherb alebheryh khelal hemlh shemal alatelsey?","Based on the provided paragraph, the Allies (Americans and British) were trying to transport goods and personnel across the Atlantic to support Britain. The Germans were trying to stop them. The paragraph states that if the Allies had failed, Germany might have been able to invade Britain. This implies that the Allies, specifically the Americans and British, were the ones who ultimately succeeded in their objective during the Battle of the Atlantic.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: alebreytaneywen walameryekyewn (The British and the Americans)**.
"
ma aledy lm yekn mewjewdaan 3anedma tebq alashewreywen asetkhedam selah alefresan?,"The correct answer is **A: Alesrewj (السرج - Saddles)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""lam yakon al-sarj 8ad okhtori3a ba3d, lithalika 7araba al-fursan al-ashurioun 3ala '6uhur khyolihim al-3aria (The saddle had not yet been invented, therefore the Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare backs of their horses).""

The passage mentions bows, chariots, and armor, indicating they existed during the time the Assyrians used cavalry.
"
keyf kanet tukhad alema3earek alety testekhedm alefresan?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: 3la zher alekheyl** (على ظهر الخيل) which translates to ""on horseback.""

The text explicitly states: ""lithalika 7araba al-fursan al-ashurioun 3ala '6uhur khyolihim al-3aria."" This translates to ""Therefore, the Assyrian cavalry fought on the backs of their bare horses.""
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ayen len tejd mewatenaan babelyaan 'eadeyaan?","Based on the passage, only priests were allowed inside the inner sanctuary (the ""maladh dakhili""). Therefore, you would NOT find an average Babylonian citizen:

*   **D: yejleb qerabeyn ela khelwh amenh (Bringing sacrifices to a secure retreat/inner sanctuary)**

The other options (A, B, C) all describe activities that would have taken place in the open courtyard or at festivals, where regular citizens would have been present."
ay mema yely kan mekhessaan lelkhenh thedyedaan?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: alekhelwh alamenh** (the safe sanctuary).

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Kana li kulli ma3bad fina2 maftu7 thumma maladh dakhili la yasta6i3 dukhulahu illa al kahana"" (Each temple had an open courtyard, then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter).
*   This ""maladh dakhili"" (inner sanctuary) represents a safe, private, and exclusive space for the priests.

Let's look at the other options:

*   A: alahetfalat (Celebrations): While priests were involved in celebrations, the text doesn't specifically say celebrations were *exclusively* for priests.
*   C: ala'eyad (Holidays/Festivals): Similar to celebrations, the text doesn't state holidays were exclusively for priests.
*   D: alezqewrh (Ziggurats): The text mentions that the upper part of Ziggurat was a sacred place for gods and not exclusively for priests.
"
meta aketseb alemlek tewt 3anekh amewn sema3eh sey'eh?,"The correct answer is **C: b3d aketshaf qebrh (after the discovery of his tomb)**.

The passage explicitly states that Tutankhamun gained fame in modern times after the discovery of his tomb in 1922.
"
ma aledy j'el alemlek tewt 3anekh amewn melkaan mesreyaan ma3erewfaan?,"The correct answer is **A: aketshaf qebrh aledy lm yu'ebeth bh** (The discovery of his tomb which was not tampered with).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Wa ma3a dhalika, fa inna ektishafa qabrihi fi 3am 1922 ja3aluhu min al mashahir. Fi 7in tamma naheb al 3adid min al qubur al qadima, illa annahu lam yattem al 3abath bi hadha al qabr.""  This translates to ""However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous. While many ancient tombs were looted, this tomb was not tampered with.""

The other options are incorrect based on the passage:

*   **B: wed'eh fi lewa'eh alemlek aleqdeymh** (His placement in the ancient king lists): The passage states he *wasn't* prominent in ancient times and *wasn't* recorded in most ancient king lists.
*   **C: serqh alaf aleqt' alatheryh men qebrh** (The theft of thousands of artifacts from his tomb): The passage states his tomb was *not* looted.
*   **D: ahemyeth khelal al'esewr alemseryh aleqdeymh** (His importance during the ancient Egyptian eras): The passage specifically mentions he lacked importance in the ancient periods."
ma aledy kan alesha'er aleywenaney Homer gheyr qader 3la aleqyam bh?,"The text states that Homer was a ""blind"" poet. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: aler'eyh (seeing)**
"
ay yewnaney meshhewr ma3erewf beshey' akher gheyr aladeb?,"The correct answer is **C: Pythagorus**.

Here's why:

*   The text mentions Pythagorus as a mathematician known for his theorem, not primarily for literature.
*   Sophocles, Homer, and Aristophanes are all explicitly mentioned as literary figures (playwrights and poet)."
ayen kanet al'ea'elh al'eberyh teqdey ma3ezem weqtha?,"The correct answer is **A: fi alhewa' aletleq** (في الهواء الطلق), which translates to ""in the open air.""

The passage states: ""Qadhat mu3dham al 2usar al Yahudiyya 7ayataha fi al hawa2 attaleq."" This translates to: ""Most Jewish families spent their lives in the open air.""
"
ma aledy lm yekn mhemaan jedaan lel'ea'elh al'eberyh?,"Based on the passage provided, the correct answer is:

**C: menazelhem (Their houses)**

The passage states that in the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not of great importance. Jewish families spent most of their lives outdoors.
"
ayun mema yely la yewsef banh ferq beyn alebledan alaseknednafeyh?,"The answer is **B: alared** (the land/terrain/geography).

Here's why:

*   The paragraph mentions differences in **history (aletareykh)**, **customs (al'eadat)**, and **peoples (alesh'eb)** between the Scandinavian countries.
*   It does *not* explicitly mention differences in the land itself (alared), although it implicitly exists. The focus is on the cultural and historical differences despite the shared ""Scandinavian"" label.

Therefore, ""alared"" is the only option that isn't directly mentioned as a difference between the Scandinavian countries."
men sekn Greenland awelaan?,"The correct answer is **A: qeba'el alesekyemw** (Eskimo tribes).

The passage states that ""qaba2el al Eskimo ta3ish hunak bil fi3l fi dhalika al waqet"" which translates to ""Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.""
"
ay mejmew'eh tefdel tenawel al'esha' bedwen karasi?,"The correct answer is **C: al rijal al Ruman al aghniya2** (The rich Roman men).

The passage states: ""...baynama kana al fuqara2 wal nisa2 ya2kulun ta3amahum athna2a julusihem 3ala al karasi, fadhdhala al rijal al aghniya2 iqamat al wala2im ma3an 7aythu yastari7un 3ala janibihim athan2 tanawulihim wajibatihim.""

This translates to: ""...while the poor and women ate their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men preferred to hold banquets together where they reclined on their sides while eating their meals.""
"
ay mema yely len yekwen jez'aan men welyemh rewmaneyh qedyemh?,"The correct answer is **D: tebq men aledyek alerwemy alemshewy (Dish of grilled turkey)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""wa lam yatathawa8 Al-ruman al-8udama al-dik al-rumi (and the ancient Romans did not taste turkey).""
*   The other options are mentioned or implied in the passage.
    *   A: deywef feqra' yetnawelwen alet3am 3la alekrasey (Poor guests eating on chairs) is mentioned as a contrast to wealthy men reclining.
    *   B: meqbelat men aleqwaq' (Appetizers from pumpkins/squash) is a plausible side dish, and that ancient romans didn't eat food from america or asia that came into europe later.

Therefore, a dish of grilled turkey could not have been part of an ancient Roman feast."
"bena'an 3la alfqrh, ay mema yely men gheyr alemrejh an yekwen lh tatheyr da'em?","The correct answer is **D: Theqafh 7adaria (Civilization)**.

Here's why:

*   The paragraph states that civilization (thaqafa 7adaria) involves the transmission of knowledge across generations and a lasting cultural imprint (basma thaqafiyya baqiya). This explicitly implies a lasting impact.
*   The paragraph also mentions that minority cultures (thaqafat al-a8lliyat) often disappear without leaving historical evidence.
*   Option A, ""mejtema3,"" is too broad. Not every society necessarily leaves a lasting impact.
*   Option B, ""thaqafa seghera,"" is specifically described as being likely to disappear.
*   Option C, ""medyenh mesteqlh dateyaan,"" while historically important, the paragraph doesn't explicitly state that all independent city-states will have a lasting impact, unlike civilizations which are defined, in part, by their enduring cultural legacy."
"wefqaan llfqrh, ma aledy yesbeq alamh?","Based on the provided paragraph (P), the correct answer is **C: medyenh mesteqlh dateyaan (independent city-states)**.

Here's why:

* The paragraph states: ""Al mudun ad-duwal hiya aslaf al 2umam"" which translates to ""City-states are the ancestors of nations."" This clearly indicates that city-states predate nations.
"
ay jemlh 7wl Drukgyal Dzong leyset sheyhh?,"The incorrect statement is **C: demr heryeq al3adid men athar aleql'eh (A fire destroyed many of the castle's remains)**

The passage states that the fire left behind some remains, such as the portrait of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel. It did not destroy *many* of the remains, but rather left some intact.  The other options are all supported by the text.
"
ay jemlh tesf bedqh neta'ej alheryeq fi Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **A: alebqaya alewheydh alemtebqeyh kanet sewrh Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal** (The only remaining remains were a picture of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Fi 3am 1951, tasabbaba 7ariq fi baqa2 ba3d athar Drukgyal Dzong, mithl surat Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal."" This translates to ""In 1951, a fire caused some traces of Drukgyal Dzong to remain, such as a picture of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal."" This clearly indicates that the picture was among the remains.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: anetsert aleqwat aletbetyh alemg7wleyh:** (The Mongol-Tibetan forces were victorious) This is the opposite of what the passage describes the fort commemorating.
*   **C: lem tetather sh'ebeyh mekan alejdeb:** (The popularity of the tourist attraction was not affected) The passage says that after the fire it was preserved and became a major attraction.
*   **D: hafez 3aleha Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal:** (Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal preserved it) Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal is credited for creating the original fortress, not preserving it after the fire.

Therefore, the best answer is **A**."
ayun men alejmel atalyh 3an kembewdeya sheyh?,"The correct answer is **D: Aletayelanedyewn demrewa Phnom Phen (The Thais destroyed Phnom Penh)**.

The passage states: ""Eqta7ama al Taylandiyyun Kambodya marrat 3adidah khilala al qarn al thamen 3ashar w fi 3am 1772 dammaru Phnim Phen (The Thais invaded Cambodia multiple times during the 18th century and in 1772 they destroyed Phnom Penh).""
"
ayun men al'ebarat atalyh yesf bedqh ghezw kembewdeya?,"The correct answer is **D: gheza aletayelanedyewn kembewdeya 'edh merat (The Thais invaded Cambodia several times)**.

Here's why:

*   **P (The Passage):** States that the Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century.

Let's analyze why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: gheza alefyetnameywen kembewdeya 'edh merat (The Vietnamese invaded Cambodia several times):** The passage states that the Vietnamese invaded Cambodia *in the last years of the 18th century*, not several times throughout the century like the Thais.
*   **B: gheza aletayelanedyewn walefyetnameywen kembewdeya 3am 1772 (The Thais and Vietnamese invaded Cambodia in 1772):** Only the Thais are mentioned invading and destroying Phnom Penh in 1772.
*   **C: demr alefyetnameywen Phnom Phen (The Vietnamese destroyed Phnom Penh):** The passage explicitly says the *Thais* destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772."
ay mema yely lm tef'elh s7erkh alhend alesherqeyh al7wlendeyh khelal fetrh wejwedha fi Taiwan?,"The correct answer is **D: tenazelt ta'e'eh 3an alesyetrh 3la Taiwan leslalh tesheynegh** (relinquished control of Taiwan to the Qing Dynasty).

Here's why:

*   **A: ametlekt qa'edh fi alejz' alejnewbey alegherbey men alejzeyrh** (possessed a base in the southwestern part of the island): This is stated in the text: ""Fi 3am 1624, ansha2at sharikat al Hind al sharqiyya al Hulandiyya qa3ida fi janub gharb Taywan"" (In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan).
*   **B: memaresh enetaj alhebweb alaselyh** (practiced original grain production): This is accurate in the sense that they changed the agricultural practices as mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: wezfet 'emalaan seyneyyen fi mezar'eha** (employed Chinese workers in its farms): This is stated in the text: ""...wa tawdhif al 3ummal al Siniyin lil 3amal fi mazare3 al aruz wal sukar"" (...and employing Chinese workers to work in rice and sugar farms).
*   **D: tenazelt ta'e'eh 3an alesyetrh 3la Taiwan leslalh tesheynegh** (relinquished control of Taiwan to the Qing Dynasty): The Dutch East India Company DID NOT relinquish control to the Qing dynasty. The Qing dynasty took control by force (""sytarat quwat usraty Qing""). It was the Qing Dynasty that ceded Taiwan to Japan later on. Therefore, this is something the Dutch East India Company did not do."
mada aneshat ma3eahedh Shimonoseki?,"The correct answer is **D: selth aleyaban 3la Taiwan (Japanese control over Taiwan)**.

The passage states that after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan.  Therefore, the Treaty of Shimonoseki resulted in Japanese control over Taiwan.
"
keyf yuqas mestewa alas alheyderwejyeny lemadh keymeya'eyh?,"The correct answer is **C: kemyh ayewnat alheyderwejyen fi alemadh alekyemya'eyh (quantity of hydrogen ions in the chemical substance)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the amount of hydrogen ions (ayunat al-haydrojyn) indicates the pH level of a chemical substance.
*   The passage emphasizes that the concentration of hydrogen ions is directly related to the pH level."
ma aledy auzeyl men Ayunat al-haydrojyn?,"The text states: ""Ayunat al-haydrojyn 3ibara 3an brotonat jurridat min elektronatiha"" which translates to ""Hydrogen ions are protons stripped of their electrons"".

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: al brotonat (the protons)**
"
ay men alejmel atalyh la tesf bedqh qety' asewd?,"Let's break down the passage and the question:

*   **Passage Summary:** Lions are very social, living in large groups called prides. Prides consist of 1-3 adult males, up to 30 females, and cubs. Females are closely related, forming extended family groups. Lions act like wolf or dog packs.

*   **Question:** Which statement *does not* accurately describe a lion pride?

Now let's analyze the answer options:

*   **A: yetserfewn beshekl meshabh leqtey' aleklab (They behave similarly to dog packs)** This is mentioned in the passage as true.

*   **B: nesbh aledkewr ela alenath leyset metsaweyh (The ratio of males to females is not equal)** This is also true, as the passage states there are far more females than males.

*   **C: aledkewr walenath jami3ehem mertebtewn aretbataan wetheyqaan (Males and females are all closely related)** The passage states only the **females** are closely related. Males are not necessarily related to the females or each other.

*   **D: hem memyetwen wajetma'eyewn (They are deadly and social)** This aligns with the passage: they are described as lethal to their prey, and the whole passage focuses on their social structure.

**Therefore, the correct answer is C: aledkewr walenath jami3ehem mertebtewn aretbataan wetheyqaan (Males and females are all closely related)**."

*   The text explicitly states that lion behavior is similar to wolves/dogs, *not* other big cats: ""wal 7ayawanat al 2u5ra tushbeh al 2usud bi shaklin kabir fi sulukiha (wa laken la yashmul al qe6a6 al kabira al 2u5ra)"" which translates to ""and other animals greatly resemble lions in their behavior (but this does *not* include other big cats)"".

The other options are supported by the text:

*   **A: hem ajetma'eyewn lelghayh** (They are very social) - The text describes the lion's pride structure, emphasizing the close relationships and cooperative nature of the females.
*   **B: selwekhem meshabh leslewk aled'eab** (Their behavior is similar to that of wolves) - This is directly stated in the text.
*   **C: kel men aledkewr walenath memyetwen lelghayh balensebh lelferyesh** (Both males and females are deadly to prey) - The final sentence of the original text translates to the group is immensely lethal towards its prey."
alaraneb feryesh sha'e'eh lay new' men alheywanat alemfetresh?,"Let's break down the Arabic text and the question to determine the answer.

* **P (Arabic Text Translation):** ""There are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, starting from rabbits and reaching wolves and gazelles. Finally, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat the most numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, and birds. The secret of their success is the concept of specialization, which means defining a specific job for each cat that prevents it from competing with others.""

* **Q (Arabic Question Translation):** ""Rabbits are prey that are preyed upon by what type of predator?"" (More literally: ""Rabbits, as prey, are preyed upon by what kind of predatory animal?"")

Now, let's look at the answer options and connect them to the translated text:

* **A: aleqtet alesgheyrh (Small cats):** The text states that small cats eat *small* prey like insects, rodents, and birds.  Rabbits are not considered small prey.
* **B: aleqtet alekbeyrh (Large cats):** The text doesn't mention specifically what large cats eat, so we can't say for sure.
* **C: aleqtet metwesth alhejm (Medium-sized cats):** The text *explicitly* states that medium-sized cats eat prey including rabbits.
* **D: alziba2 (Wolves):**  Wolves are predators; they are mentioned in the text as prey (medium sized cats eating them).

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: aleqtet metwesth alhejm (Medium-sized cats)**.
"

The passage states: ""al lati ta2kul al fara2es al saghira al akthar 3adadan mithla al 7asharat wal qawaredh wal 6uyur."" This translates to ""that eat the most numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, and birds.""

Here's why:

*   **A: aletmahey ma3 m7ythem (Blending in with their environment)** - The passage mentions: ""ta96ad al-a9lwt fara2saha min khilal al-indimaj fy tafa9yl al-by2a al-mu7y6a biha"" (The Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into the details of the surrounding environment...) So, this is part of their hunting technique.

*   **B: eteba' ra'ehh feryesthem (Following the scent of their prey)** - The passage mentions: ""Ya3taqed al 3ulama2 anna 7ayawan al Ocelot yula7eq 3an tariq 7assat al sham al 7ayawanat li ya3thor 3alayha wa ya2kuloha"" (Scientists believe that the Ocelot tracks animals by scent to find and eat them). So, this is also part of their hunting technique.

*   **C: eteba' feryesthem athena' alelyel (Following their prey at night)** - The passage mentions: ""Yumkinuha al-ru2ya jayyida fy al-'6alam bilru2yati al-layliya walatta7aruk bikhilsa shadyda kathalik."" (They can see well in the dark with night vision and move very stealthily as well.) This implies they hunt at night.

*   **D: yeftersewn feqt alheywanat dat alhejm alasegher (They only prey on animals of smaller size)** - While the passage states: ""tu3ad jamy3 al-7ayawanat allaty ya96adunaha al-a9lwt a9ghar bikathyr mima hiya 3alayh fy al-7ajm ta8ryban"" (All the animals that the Ocelots hunt are much smaller in size compared to them), it doesn't definitively say that they *only* prey on smaller animals. It just states that their prey are significantly smaller than them. ""Much smaller"" doesn't necessarily mean they *never* hunt animals of similar size.

Therefore, the statement that is *not* necessarily a part of the ocelot's hunting technique is that they *only* hunt smaller animals. They primarily hunt smaller animals but are not limited to *only* hunting smaller animals."
ay mema yely la yesf bedqh alenmer aleqzem? ,"The correct answer is **C: hash aleshem ledyhem d'eyefh (Their sense of smell is weak)**

This explicitly says their sense of smell is *strong*, not weak.
*   The other options are accurate descriptions based on the text:
    *   A: ""hem qaderwen 3la alesyed alejyed fi alelyel (They are good at hunting at night)"" is supported by the passage stating, ""Yumkinuha al-ru2ya jayyida fy al-'6alam bilru2yati al-layliya (They can see well in the dark with night vision).""

*   Climbing (though not well)
*   Swimming
*   Long Jumping
*   Pulling (5 times the strength of a human)
*   Roaring

The question (Q) asks which of the following is *not* considered a strength of the tiger.

Comparing the options to the text:

*   **A: Roaring** - The text mentions that the four members of the genus Panthera are the only ones that can roar and describes the tiger's roar. So, this *is* a strength.
*   **B: Climbing** - The text states that the tiger can climb, *though not well*. So, climbing *is* something the tiger does.
*   **C: Jumping** - The text says that the tiger can do a long jump. So, jumping *is* a strength.
*   **D: Pulling** - The text says that the tiger is able to pull (or drag) with 5x the strength of a human. So, pulling *is* a strength.

But the text also states: The tiger can climb *though not well*.

The best answer is climbing, because the text specifically says the tiger does it, but doesn't do it *well*. The others, it does well.

**Therefore, the correct answer is B: Climbing.**"

The text explicitly states that ""Za2ir al nemer la yushbihu za2ir al asad bl dhabet"" (The tiger's roar is not exactly like the lion's roar). The passage describes that they have different types of roar sounds (tiger's roar is like combination of growls and screams), however, it doesn't explicitly state if the other abilities, such as swimming, jumping distance and strength of pull, are different between tigers and lions.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes a small group of organisms separating from a larger population and adapting to a new environment.
*   Over time, this new population evolves differently from the original population.
*   This divergence leads to the formation of new species.
*   The definition of speciation aligns perfectly with a single population eventually splitting into two distinct populations.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: mejmew'eh segheyrh tefshel fi alazedhar fi mewq' jedyed (مجموعة صغيرة تفشل في الازدهار في موقع جديد)** - While a small group may struggle in a new location, this is not the defining feature of speciation. The key is the subsequent adaptation and divergence.
*   **B: jez' men aleskan yenteqlewn ela bey'eh jedyedh (جزء من السكان ينتقلون إلى بيئة جديدة)** - This is a necessary initial step for allopatric speciation, but it's not the whole process.
*   **C: sekan y'edelwen tekyefhem fi bey'eh jedyedh (سكان يعدلون تكيفهم في بيئة جديدة)** - Adaptation is also a critical part of speciation, but speciation involves the divergence of the two populations until they can no longer interbreed.

Therefore, only **D** encapsulates the end result and the core concept of speciation as described in the passage."

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that speciation occurs because the new population *does* adapt to its new environment. The need to adapt to a new environment, leading to differences and eventually speciation, is the *reason* for the process.

The other options are supported by the text:

*   **B: hey janeb hasem fi 3malyh alettewr ( هي جانب حاسم في عملية التطور - It is a crucial aspect of the evolutionary process)**: The passage states that speciation is a ""highly important part of the process of evolution.""

The smallest tubes are capillaries (al shu3ayrat al damawiyya).
*   **Q (Question):** Which part of the circulatory system brings blood *towards* the heart?

From the information in P, we know:

*   Arteries take blood *away* from the heart.
*   Veins bring blood *to* the heart.
*   Capillaries are the smallest vessels.

Therefore, the answer is **D: al awrida** (veins)."

*  The other option walking on rear legs is also mentioned in the text, so the answer is also **A: المشي على الساق الخلفية (Alemshey 3la alesaq alekhelfeyh) - Walking on rear legs**

Option B, ""الريش (Aleryesh) - Feathers"" is a defining feature of birds that distinguishes them from many people's traditional idea of dinosaurs, and it is mentioned in the passage as a reason why some don't consider them dinosaurs.

Therefore the correct answers are **A, C, and D**."

"wefqaan llfqrh, ay men ataly men alemrejh an yakelh aletrayesratewbes? ","The correct answer is **B: nebt dat ferw' selbh (plant with tough branches)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Triceratops' teeth were strong enough to crush not just leaves, but also tough branches and roots. It also mentions the possibility that they ate cycads, a plant with tough, palm-like foliage. While it's debated whether they ate the cycads due to toxicity concerns, the passage definitively says their teeth were capable of handling tough plant matter. The other options are not mentioned as being something the Triceratops *could* eat, but rather animals that *can* eat certain tough or poisonous plants.

The passage states that Latin is often used in religious ceremonies (""ghaliban ma tastakhdimu allatiniya fil i7tifalat addiniya""). The other options are incorrect because the passage states that Italian is used for legislation and official statements, and it is the language spoken by most workers in the Vatican. The passage does not mention its use for daily communications.

"wefqaan llfqrh, ma hew janeb alhedth aledy yusetkhedm lemqarenh alewqet?","The correct answer is **B: altkerar (التكرار)**, which translates to **repetition**.

The passage states: ""Yumkinuka ta7did murur alwaqt bi nafsika min khilal muraqabat tikrar a7ad ala7dath addawriya."" This translates to: ""You can determine the passage of time yourself by observing the repetition of a periodic event.""

Therefore, the passage indicates that the *repetition* of an event is used for comparing time.

"wefqaan llfqrh, ay mema yely y'etebr nemwedjeyaan lewreyth al'eresh?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: aledhab ela alejama3eh qebl alalethaq balejyesh (going to university before joining the army)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage contrasts ""my al-ta8alyd al-muttaba3a (the typical traditions)"" of the heir to the throne joining the army directly after school with Charles' actual path. Charles went to university *before* doing anything else. This implies the atypical nature of his choice to go to university first.
*   A, B, and C describe specific details of Charles' *unique* experience (getting a 2:2, not joining the army directly, and studying history). The question asks what is *typical*."
"bena'an 3la alema3elewmat alewaredh fi alfqrh, kan Charles awel men f'el maza?","The correct answer is **C: ḥaṣala ʿalā šahāda (got a degree)**.

Here's why:

*   The paragraph states: ""Kāna Tshharles awal fard fi al-3a2ila al-malika al-britaniya ya7sul 3ala daraja 3ilmiya."" which translates to ""Charles was the first person in the British royal family to obtain a degree.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: anḍamma ila aljaysh qabla al-intihā' min al-madrasa (joined the army before finishing school)** - The paragraph states the opposite.
*   **B: darasa ʿilm al-ʾāthār (studied archeology)** - The paragraph states Charles studied archeology, but not that he was the first to do so.
*   **D: ʾaltaḥaqa bikulliyyat Trinity (joined Trinity College)** -The paragraph states Charles went to Trinity College, but not that he was the first of the royal family to do so."

The passage states: ""Kana hadha al 2ustul bi qiyadat Olaf Trygvasson, wa houwa muwaten Narwijiy... (This fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson, and he was a Norwegian citizen...)""
"

The 15th century is the 1400s (1400-1499).  The current year is roughly 2024.

2024 - 1450 (middle of 15th century) is roughly 574 years.

Therefore, the closest answer is **C: mundhu hewaley 600 3am** (approximately 600 years ago).
"

**Translation of the relevant part of the paragraph:**

""Yakhtalief 3adad al natiqin beha 7asab ma edha kana yatum 7isab al lahjat wathiqat al sila beha aw la.""

This translates to:

""The number of speakers varies depending on whether closely related dialects are counted or not.""

Therefore, the number of native Hindi speakers fluctuates depending on whether or not very similar dialects are included in the count."

Here's why:

*   The passage states the Hangul alphabet was invented in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450). This was *not* at the *beginning* of his reign.

Let's look at the other options to confirm:

*   **B: kan alasem alasely lelabejdeyh hewnan jeywenjewm** (The original name of the alphabet was Hummin Jeongeum): This is directly stated in the passage.
*   **C: akhetr'eh alemlek alerab' laserh Joseon** (It was invented by the fourth king of Joseon): The passage states King Sejong was the *third* king of Joseon, not the fourth. But option A is a more direct misstatement of a fact in the provided text.
*   **D: tem akhetra'eha 3an 3amd** (It was invented on purpose): The first sentence states that Hangul is the only alphabet invented *intentionally* for popular use.

Therefore, option A is the least accurate statement about the Hangul alphabet based on the provided text."
tem tegheyyer alabejdeyh Hunmin Jeongeum fi alenhayh ela mada?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

The passage states: ""2utliqa fil asel 3ala abjadiyat al Hangeul isim Hummin Jeongeum..."" which translates to ""Originally the Hangeul alphabet was called Hummin Jeongeum..."" This implies that Hummin Jeongeum was the original name and it was later changed to Hangeul.
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ma hey al lughat alety tathert balelghh alesneskeryetyh?","The correct answer is **D: al lughat alhendeyh** (Indian languages).

Here's why:

*   The paragraph states that Sanskrit was a source for many modern languages. Although it uses Latin as an example of a similar language for European languages, it doesn't explicitly state Sanskrit influenced Latin languages in the paragraph. The focus is on its influence as a source for new languages.
*   While Sanskrit *is* an old language, option C is too general and doesn't directly address the paragraph's point about influence on specific languages.

Therefore, the best answer based on the given information is that Sanskrit influenced Indian languages."
"wefqaan llfqrh, teqles asetkhedam alelghh alesneskeryetyh besbeb mada?","The correct answer is **D: aletselsel alhermey (al-tadaruj al-haramy)**.

The other options are incorrect:
*   **A: alet'eqeyd (the belief)**: This is not mentioned in relation to the decline of Sanskrit.
*   **B: alhejrh alareyh (the Aryan migration)**: This is related to the *origin* of Sanskrit, not its decline.
*   **C: al lughat alelateyneyh (the Latin languages)**: While Latin is mentioned as a comparison, it's not a reason for Sanskrit's decline."
"wefqaan llfqrh, ay men alejmel atalyh hey jemlh deqyeqh feyma yet'eleq balejadebyh 3la ayew?","The correct answer is **D: jadebyh alared setjedbek akether men jadebyh ayew (The gravity of Earth will attract you more than the gravity of Io).**

The passage states that you would weigh less on Io than on Earth because Io's gravity doesn't pull as strongly. This directly implies that Earth's gravity pulls more strongly than Io's.
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ay men al'ebarat atalyh tesf bedqh aletbeqh alekharejyh lelqemr?","The correct answer is **D: qed yekwn henak 7imam aqel ta7ta almurtafa3at** (There may be less lava under the highlands).

Here's why:

* **The paragraph states:** ""Qad yujad almazid mina al mintaqa al-mudhlima (maria) 3la aljanib alqarib wa dhalika li anna alqishra araq kana su3ud al7imam alburkaniya ila assat7 2amran sahlan."" This translates to: ""There may be more dark regions (maria) on the near side because the crust is thinner, so the ascent of volcanic lava to the surface was easier.""

This implies the opposite is true for the highlands (murtafa3at): If maria are formed where lava *easily* reaches the surface due to a *thinner* crust, then highlands must have a *thicker* crust, making it *harder* for lava to reach the surface.  Therefore, there would be *less* lava under the highlands.
Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: alejaneb aleqreyb lh qesherh akether semkaan (The near side has a thicker crust):** The paragraph states the opposite - that the near side has a *thinner* crust.

*   **B: aleqsherh areq ta7ta almurtafa3at (The crust is thinner under the highlands):** The paragraph explicitly states the crust is *thicker* under the highlands.

*   **C: qed yekwen henak aleqleyl men alhemm 3la alejaneb aleb'eyed (There may be less worry on the far side):** This has nothing to do with the information presented in the paragraph. It is a mistranslation of the original option.

**Therefore, option D is the only one that accurately reflects the information given in the paragraph.**"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ayen hey qishrat alqamar alakether sumkan?","The correct answer is **C: ta7ta almurtafa3at (under the highlands)**.

The passage states: ""Innahu aqalu sumkan ta7ta al mintaqa al-mudhluma (maria), wa akthara sumkan ta7ta almurtafa3at."" which translates to ""It is thinner under the dark areas (maria) and thicker under the highlands.""
"
"bena'an 3la alemfeqrh, ay mema yely y'eteqdh b3d alenas?","The correct answer is **A: Safer alebsher ela nejwem akhera** (Travel of humans to other stars).

The passage states: ""Ya7lum alkathir min annas bil yawm alladhy yumkinu fihi lil bashar assafar ila najmin akhar wa istikshaf 3awalim ukhra..."" which translates to ""Many people dream of the day when humans can travel to another star and explore other worlds..."". This directly supports the idea that some people believe humans will travel to other stars.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: alebsher gheyr qaderyen 3la asetkeshaf 'ewalem akhera** (Humans are not able to explore other worlds) - The passage actually discusses the *possibility* of humans exploring other worlds, directly contradicting this option.
*   **C: alheyah mewjewdh 3la kewakeb akhera** (Life exists on other planets) - While the passage mentions people wondering about the existence of extraterrestrial life, it doesn't explicitly state that *some people believe it exists*, just that they *wonder* if others believe it.
*   **D: henak aqel men teryelyewnat alameyal beyn alenjewm** (There are less than trillions of miles between stars) - The passage states the *opposite*: ""annujum muntashira li darajat anna hunak trilyunat al amyal bayna annujum..."" which translates to ""the stars are so scattered that there are trillions of miles between the stars...""."

*   Q asks: ""What becomes lighter/less heavy as you move away from the center of the sun?""

Based on the text, the answer is:

*   **C: aleghaz (the gas)**

The passage specifically states the gas becomes less weighty as you move away from the sun's core."

*   **B: enh alenher alakebr (It is the largest river)** - This is a true statement about the Amazon.
*   **C: enh alenher alatewl (It is the longest river)** - This is a FALSE statement. The passage says it's the *second* longest.
*   **D: enh alenher al'ered (It is the wide river)** - The passage mentions that it is the widest river, and ""al'ered"" could be a misinterpretation.

The correct answer is **C: enh alenher alatewl**."
ma hew mejal al3mal alemdekwer fi alfqrh waledy yewzef aqel 3dd men alefnezweyleyyen?,"The answer is **C: al naf6** (oil).

Here's why:

*   The paragraph states: ""wa7id bil mi2a faqat ya3malun fi sina3at al naft"" which translates to ""only one percent work in the oil industry."" This is a smaller percentage than any of the other sectors mentioned.

Therefore, the oil industry employs the least number of Venezuelans compared to the other options provided."

*   **Industry:** One-quarter of working Venezuelans work in the industrial sector.
*   **Agriculture:** One-fifth of working Venezuelans work in agriculture.
*   **Oil:** Only one percent of Venezuelans work in the oil industry.

Since one-third is the largest fraction among those listed, the service sector employs the most Venezuelans.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: al khadamat (Services)**."

This translates to: ""Stars emit light and heat due to the energy resulting from the bonding or fusion of hydrogen atoms together to form heavier elements.""
*   The passage then mentions scientists are trying to create reactors that can produce energy in the same way.
*   Therefore, a useful fusion reactor would need hydrogen as its fuel source to initiate the fusion reaction.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: alenjewm (stars):** Stars are where the fusion process occurs naturally, but they are not what scientists are trying to create.
*   **C: aledrat (atoms):** While atoms are involved, hydrogen atoms are specifically needed for the fusion process described.

"3anedma yetgheyr shekl alema', ma aledy seybeqa kema hew?","The correct answer is **A: alebneyh alejzey'eyh (the molecular structure)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explains that when elements or compounds change state (solid, liquid, gas), their *molecular structure* remains the same. Water (H2O) is given as an example: it's always two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom bonded together, regardless of whether it's ice, liquid water, or steam.

*   The other options are incorrect because:

    *   B: alekthafh (Density): Density changes when water changes state.
    *   C: alhalh alefyezya'eyh (Physical state): The physical state is *what* changes (solid, liquid, gas).
    *   D: alenterwejyen alesa'el (Liquid nitrogen): The text uses liquid nitrogen as a similar example to water, but not as the unchanged structure when *water* changes form.

Therefore, the molecular structure (alebneyh alejzey'eyh) is what remains the same when water changes its form."

**A: esheraf kebyer men seltat aledwelh** (Extensive oversight from state authorities)

Here's why:

The paragraph explicitly states the following problems:

*   **Weak central government:** This implies lack of authority/oversight.
*   **Congress as the only component:** This points to lack of power within the congress itself.
*   **Lack of taxation power:** The ability to levy taxes and tariffs between states.
*   **Lack of Executive and Judicial branch:** The absence of national executive and judicial authorities
*   **Uncooperative states:** The states were often not cooperative with the central government.
*   **Amendments requiring unanimous consent:** Amendments needing unanimous consent from all states.

The passage says the states *were* uncooperative and lacked oversight from the central government, meaning the problem was the *opposite* of extensive state oversight."

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""...akhadhat adduwal al 7ukuma al markaziyya bi 5effa shadidah li darajat anna mumathiliha ghaliban ma kanu gha2ibin."" which directly translates to ""The states took the central government very lightly to the extent that their representatives were often absent.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: tem ferd aledra'eb men qebl alekwenghers wesletat alewlayh** (Taxes were imposed by Congress and the authority of the states): The passage explicitly states that the Congress *lacked* the power to impose taxes (""wa kan al-Kongress yaftaqer 2ela ay solta li fard 2al 9ara2eb"").
*   **B: kanet alet'edeylat 3la alemwad t'etemd 3la selth alekwenghers** (Amendments to the articles depended on the authority of Congress): The passage states that amending the Articles required unanimous consent from all the states (""Tatalabat al mawad mouwafaqa bi ejma3 min jami3 al wilayat an yujri ta3dilaha"").
*   **D: taleft alhekwemh alemrekzeyh men 3anesreyn r'eyesyeyn** (The central government consisted of two main elements): The text indicates that the central government was composed of only the Congress (""wa kana al-kongress howa al-mukawin al-wa7id laha"").

    * Although pyramid construction continued using stone until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in size or artistic distinction.
    * The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the works of their ancestors, which were already over 1000 years old.

* **The Question (Q) asks:**
    * According to the paragraph, what characteristic of the Giza pyramids would the New Kingdom Egyptians *likely not* have been amazed by?

Now let's evaluate the options:

* **A: 3mrhem (Their age):** The paragraph *explicitly* mentions that the Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the *age* of the pyramids (over 1000 years old). So, this is something they *would* have been amazed by, making it an incorrect answer.

* **B: asetkhedam alhejr (The use of stone):** The paragraph mentions that pyramids continued to be built with stone *throughout* the Old Kingdom. So the New Kingdom Egyptians would have been familiar with building pyramids with stone as well. It's unlikely they'd be particularly amazed by just the *use* of stone.

* **C: hejmhem (Their size):** The paragraph *explicitly* states that the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in size. This implies that their size was remarkable and likely to inspire awe. So, they would have been amazed by the size. Incorrect answer.

* **D: bena'ehem (Their construction):** The paragraph mentions the artistic distinction of the construction. Thus they would have been amazed by their construction. Incorrect answer

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: asetkhedam alhejr (The use of stone)**."

*   It also stresses the need to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt (**takhalus min al qawa3ed wal sufun al Britaniyya fi Mesir**, which relates to options A and D).
*   Building additional ships is mentioned as something they *did* (banaw arba3 sufun jadida), but it's not stated as a *necessary step* to conquer African countries beyond what they already had. The passage focuses on using existing ships strategically and eliminating British presence.

The passage states that submarines initially traveled mostly on the surface. However, as radar technology developed and became more accurate, submarines were forced to submerge to avoid detection. Therefore, the development of radar caused submarines to start traveling underwater.
"
"khelal asetkhedamha alawel, kan netaq aleghewasat mhedwedaan jedaan fi ay mejal?","The correct answer is **C: etelaq alenar (إطلاق النار)**, which translates to ""firing range"".

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Fi dhalika al waqet kanu yattasimun bil bu6u2 al shadid wa kana nitaq ar-rimaya ma7dudan lil ghaya."" This translates to: ""At that time, they were characterized by extreme slowness and the firing range was very limited."" Therefore, the range of fire was limited during the early use of submarines.
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, men aledy anethek alatefaqeyh? ","Based on the text, the Soviets (الاتحاد السوفيتي - al-itti7ad alsovieti) violated the agreements. Therefore, the correct answer is:

"
ay mema yely lm yenfedh alejyesh alahemr?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **C: e'eadh tenzeym 3la tewl alejser (Reorganization along the length of the bridge)**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that the only hope for the Polish defense was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridge.
*   However, the Soviet invasion made this plan obsolete, meaning the Red Army prevented this reorganization from happening.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   A: Enesha' jebhh awekraneyh (Creation of the Ukrainian Front) - The text states the Red Army *created* this front, it wasn't something prevented.
*   B: Ajetyah alemnateq alesherqeyh (Invasion of the eastern regions) - The Red Army *did* invade the eastern regions.
*   D: Anethak alema3eahedh (Violation of treaties) - The Red Army *did* violate treaties."
mada hedth lelqa'ed al3am leljeysh al'easher aleyetaley?,"The correct answer is **C: aleqa alebreytaneywen aleqbed 3aleh** (The British captured him).

The text states: ""Fi kamin sharq Bardia, 2asara albritaniyun almuhandis al3am lil jaysh al itali al3ashir, algeneral Lastucci."" This means ""In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured the general engineer of the Italian Tenth Army, General Lastucci.""
"
ayen qetl Italo Balbo?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobruk**.

The passage states that Marshal Italo Balbo was killed by friendly fire while landing in Tobruk.
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ay men aletqenyat atalyh jez' mhem men aletamel aletbety?","Based on the provided paragraph, the correct answer is **C: tekheyl alalhh (visualizing deities)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states: ""yatakha9a9u markaz al-ta2amul al-tibitiy fy mumarasati asalyb al-tantra . yatim ta6hyr 8anawat al-6a8a min khilal tajsyd al-2aliha al-mukhtalifa..."" (The focus of Tibetan meditation is achieved through the practice of tantric methods. Energy channels are purified through the embodiment of different deities...)

This clearly indicates that visualizing deities (tajsyd al-2aliha al-mukhtalifa) is a crucial part of Tibetan meditation practices described in the paragraph.
"
"""wefqaan llfqrh, keyf yetm tensheyt aleshakerat athena' """"merkez"""" aletamel aletbety?""","Based on the paragraph provided, the correct answer is **B: eber tekheyl alalhh** (through imagining the gods).

The relevant section of the text states:  ""...yatim ta6hyr 8anawat al-6a8a min khilal tajsyd al-2aliha al-mukhtalifa watanshi6 al-shakra (marakiz al-6a8a al-sab3a fy al-jysm) wa2inarati al-wa3y.""  This translates to: ""Energy channels are purified through embodying different deities and activating the chakras (the seven energy centers in the body) and illuminating consciousness.""

While yoga postures, breathing exercises, and chanting are mentioned in relation to Kundalini yoga, the activation of chakras *specifically within the Tibetan meditation center* is directly linked to embodying/imagining the deities.
"

*   **A: Sanju Sharma**
*   **D: Jai Shankar Choudhary**
*   **B: Lakkha Singh**

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly mentions:

    *   ""Bada2 al-mughany Sangu Sharma fi al-masa2 yaleihi Gay Shankar Tshudary."" (The singer Sanju Sharma started in the evening, followed by Jai Shankar Choudhary). This means both of them performed devotional songs.
    *   ""B3ad thalik tawalla Lakha Syng 8iyadata ghina2 Al-bhagan."" (After that, Lakha Singh took over the singing of Al-bhajan).

*   Raju Khandelwal accompanied other singers but was not mentioned as a main performer of devotional songs."
"wefqaan llfqrh, men qedm aghenyh deyneyh athena' teqdeym alet3am?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

The text mentions that Lakkha Singh presented the Chhappan Bhog offering and sang bhajan (devotional songs) while doing so. While other singers performed devotional songs throughout the program, Lakkha Singh is specifically mentioned as performing them *during* the food offering.
"
ma hew al'ered qebl alakheyr fi alemsa'?,"The correct answer is **A: Sezen Aksu wa Alessandro Safina wa Haris Alexiou** (Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina, and Haris Alexiou).

The passage states that before the final performance by ""nar al 2anadol"" (fire of Anatolia), ""al-mughanniya al-turkiya Syzyn Aksu 3ar'9an ghina2yan ma3 al-tynwr al-ey6aly Alysandrw Safyna walmughany al-yunany Harys Alyksw"" (the Turkish singer Syzyn Aksu presented a singing performance with the Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and the Greek singer Haris Alexiou).
"
ma hey jenseyh Alessandro Safina?,"The correct answer is **D: eyetaley** (Italian).

The passage states: ""qaddamat al-mughanniya al-turkiya Syzyn Aksu 3ar'9an ghina2yan ma3 al-tynwr al-ey6aly Alysandrw Safyna"" which translates to ""The Turkish singer Sezen Aksu presented a singing performance with the Italian tenor Alessandro Safina.""
"
"bena'an 3la alfqrh, ay men alejmel atalyh gheyr sheyhh?","Let's analyze the provided text and the answer options:

The text describes a situation where people were stuck on a ride (qitar al-malahi) in Santa Clara, in very hot weather (around 90 degrees Fahrenheit). They were given water (tazwyd arrukab bilmiyah). It took at least an hour (sa3a 3ala al-aqal) to get the first person off the ride.

Now let's look at the options:

*   **A: kan henak heryeq fi saneta kelara (There was a fire in Santa Clara)**: The text does **not** mention a fire. It only talks about people stuck on a ride in hot weather. This statement is incorrect based on the provided text.

*   **B: kan alenas 'ealeqyen 3la qetar af'ewaney (People were stuck on a ride):** The text mentions ""Al-mukuth li ay fatra tawila mu7asaran fi qitar al-malahi"", clearly stating the people were stuck. So this is correct. The word af'ewaney is not found in the original paragraph, but from context here it seems to mean rollercoaster/ride.

*   **C: au'etey alerkab meyah (The passengers were given water):** The text says ""Jara tazwyd arrukab bilmiyah"", meaning the passengers were given water. This is correct.

*   **D: asetgherq alamer 60 deqyeqh 3la alaqel lekheraj awel shekhes men aleqtar (It took at least 60 minutes to get the first person off the ride):** The text says ""istaghraqa al-amer sa3a 3ala al-aqal li ikhraj awwal shakhes minhu"", which translates to ""it took at least an hour to get the first person off."" Since an hour is 60 minutes, this is correct.

Therefore, the only statement that is NOT true based on the text is A.

**Final Answer: A**
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, men aledy adela bet'eleyq beshan mestewa alherarh gheyr alemreyh?","The correct answer is **B: qa'ed alemtaf' (The Fire Chief)**

Here's why:

*   **P** mentions the temperature in Fahrenheit (""90 daraja fihrinhayt"").
*   **Q** asks who made a comment about the non-metric temperature level.
*   The quote in **P** is from **qa'ed al-itfa2 Skot Kouns (Fire Chief Scott Kouns)**, and he mentions the temperature being ""fi attis3inat (in the nineties)"", which implies Fahrenheit.
* The paragraph doesn't mention that the other options made a comment about the temperature.

Therefore, the Fire Chief is the one who made a comment referencing the non-metric temperature level."
ayen kan henak aneqta' fi aletyar alekherba'ey besbeb neshat teswenamey?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

The text states: ""Lam yatim tasjil ay adrar aw isabat fi Tonga, lakina alkahraba2 2inqata3at mu2aqatan..."" which translates to ""No damage or injuries were recorded in Tonga, but electricity was temporarily cut off...""
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, keyf tathert tewnegha baneqta' aletyar alekherba'ey?","The correct answer is **D: لم تتمكن السلطات من تلقي التحذيرات ذات الصلة (lem tetmekn alesletat men telqey alethedyerat dat aleslh)**.

The passage states: ""Lam yatim tasjil ay adrar aw isabat fi Tonga, lakina alkahraba2 2inqata3at mu2aqatan, mimma mana3a al-sulutat fi Tonga, 7asbama tamma tadawuluhu fili3lam. min talaqqi tahdhir min tsunami sadir 3an Markaz al-ta7dhir min tsunami fi al-mu7it al-hadi2 (PTWC)"".

This translates to: ""There were no reports of damage or injuries in Tonga, but the electricity was temporarily cut off, which prevented the authorities in Tonga, according to media reports, from receiving a tsunami warning issued by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC).""

Therefore, the power outage directly affected Tonga by preventing the authorities from receiving the tsunami warning.
"

The text explicitly states that the police were only able to clock Reid's speed once, when he slowed down to 160 km/h.
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, lemaza kan men ales'eb 3la sherth neywezyelneda tesjeyl ser'eh jewney reyd?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: kanet alesyarh menkhefdh jedaan (The car was very low).**

The passage states that the New Zealand police had difficulty using speed radar guns to determine Reid's speed because of the ""inkhifad mustawa sayarat Balck Beauty"" which translates to ""low level of the Black Beauty car.""
"
ayen temrekz alezlezal balensebh le Butte?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 meyla jenwebaan**

The text states: ""Kana markaz azilzal 3ala bu3ud ... 65 km (40 mil) 3ala bu3ud janub Buttle.""  ""Janub Buttle"" means south of Butte.
"

*   The Arabic text mentions that fires were set in Abu Ghraib prison during acts of chaos (""a3mal 4a'3ab"").
*   It also indicates mistreatment of prisoners was discovered after US forces took control (""tawali al-quwwat al-amarikiyya li zimam al-2umur"").

Therefore, the most accurate answer to ""What happened during the chaos in Abu Ghraib?"" is:

*   **D: adermet alenyeran fi alesjen (Fires were set in the prison)**

While A and C are also true based on the provided text, they don't directly answer the question of what happened *during* the chaos itself.

So the final answer is **D**."
lemaza aketseb alesjen al'eraqey sema3eh sey'eh? ,"The correct answer is **D: aketshaf esa'h ma3eamelh alesjena' (discovery of mistreatment of prisoners)**.

The passage explicitly states that the prison's reputation suffered after the discovery of the mistreatment of prisoners after the American forces took over.
"
ma new' alhedth aledy kan men alemqerr 3aqdh fi esetad alherb aletdekarey fi mawey?,"The correct answer is **C: hefl mewseyqey (Musical concert)**.

The passage mentions that ""al-firqa alghat 3ardaha"" which translates to ""the band canceled its show/performance.""  ""3ard"" (show/performance) in this context strongly suggests a musical concert.
"
men qedm fi alenhayh tefseyraan beshan elegha' alhedth?,"The correct answer is **B: sharikat al'idarah** (management company).

The text states: ""Lam tuqaddim sharikat idarat al-firqat , HK Management, sababan awwaliyyan 3indama 2ulghiya al-7afel... lakinaha fil yawm al-tali tagharra3at bi asbab lujastiyya.""  This translates to: ""The management company of the band, HK Management, did not provide an initial reason when the concert was cancelled... but the next day offered logistical reasons.""

Therefore, the management company eventually provided an explanation for the cancellation.
"

**C: alemhetjewn**

The text states: ""La8ad al8a al-3adyd min sukkan Byshkyk billawm 3ala al-muta'6ahiryn min al-janub fy a3mal al-fw'9a walkhuruj 3ala al-8anon""

Which translates to: ""Many residents of Bishkek blamed the demonstrators from the south for the acts of chaos and lawlessness.""

So, the ""demonstrators from the south"" are being blamed for the looting. In Arabic, ""demonstrators"" can be referred to with the term ""alemhetjewn""."
men aleqa balelwem 3la alemtezaheryen men alejnewb fi a'emal alenheb?,"The correct answer is **A: sekan Bishkek** (residents of Bishkek).

The text states: ""La8ad al8a al-3adyd min sukkan Byshkyk billawm 3ala al-muta'6ahiryn min al-janub fy a3mal al-fw'9a walkhuruj 3ala al-8anon."" This translates to ""Many Bishkek residents blamed the protesters from the south for the acts of chaos and lawlessness.""

The passage states: ""Wa qala assayed Siminoff inna nisbat al-mabi3at qad zdadat ba3da dhuhurihi fi 7alaka li barnamej Shark Tank fi 3am 2013..."" which translates to ""Mr. Siminoff said that the sales rate increased after his appearance in an episode of the program Shark Tank in 2013...""
"
meta qerr Jamie Siminoff bed' Ring?,"The correct answer is **A: b3d an aderk an jers babh lm yekn kafeyaan** (after he realized his doorbell was not loud enough).

The passage states that Jamie Siminoff realized his doorbell couldn't be heard from his garage workshop, which led him to create Ring. The other options are incorrect because they describe events that happened *after* the initial idea for Ring was born.
"

(Some, including John Grant, believe that the funding crisis and the shift in the philosophy of educational television programs led to the end of the series.) This directly points to insufficient funding as a contributing factor.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Adam Wujud Jawa'ez Emmy (Lack of Emmy Awards):** The text mentions that the show received more than 20 Emmy Awards, so this is incorrect.
*   **C: Ray John Grant (John Grant's Opinion):** While John Grant's opinion is mentioned, the statement indicates that many others shared the belief about funding issues. His opinion reflects a wider view, not the sole reason.
*   **D: Najah Mister Rogers' Neighborhood (Success of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood):** The text compares the length of the shows but doesn't imply that the success of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood contributed to Reading Rainbow's cancellation."

* **Q (Question):** What did the Amsterdam officials and museum *NOT* claim about the tree?

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: sewf tesqet hetmaan (It will definitely fall):** The premise states they believed it was ""on the verge of falling.""
* **B: yejb al7efaz 3aleha (It must be preserved):** The officials were *planning to cut it down*. This is the opposite of preserving it.
* **C: anha melwethh balefteryat (It is contaminated with fungi):** The premise explicitly states it is infected with fungus.
* **D: hey khetr 3la aleshh al3amh (It is a danger to public health):** The premise explicitly states it poses a public health risk.

Therefore, the only option that the officials *did not* claim is that the tree should be preserved.

The question asks what should be standard practice according to the RSPCA. The passage states that ""muraqabat wa taftish al-masale5 yajeb an takuna amran sha2i3an fi Australia"" which translates to ""monitoring and inspection of slaughterhouses should be common in Australia"". Therefore, the slaughterhouses are what the RSPCA wants to be standardly inspected.

It further mentions that the government decided *not to ratify* the agreement as a result. So, Bolanda *did* initially sign, but then backed out.
*   The other countries are mentioned as locations of protests, or as having postponed joining the agreement, but not as countries who have signed.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: bolanda**."

*   **Original Text:** States that Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced her presidential candidacy at the Argentine Theater (al-masra7 al-arjentini) in La Plata, which is 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires.

Now let's look at the answer options:

*   **A:**  Incorrect. It states the theater is 31 miles from La Plata which is the opposite.
*   **B:** Incorrect.  It says the theater is in Buenos Aires, but the original text says La Plata.
*   **C:** Correct. It accurately describes where she announced: in the Argentine Theater (al-masra7 al-arjentini), 31 miles from Buenos Aires (consistent with the distance from La Plata).
*   **D:** Incorrect.  This is not stated in the text.

Therefore, the best answer is **C**."

The passage clearly states that ACMA (the Australian Communications and Media Authority) found that Big Brother did **not** violate internet content censorship laws. The reasoning is that the media wasn't stored on the Big Brother website's server, a requirement for the content to be considered ""internet content"" under the Broadcasting Services Act.

"
lemaza la temtelk asetraleya balef'el sena'eh taqh newweyh?,"Based on the provided text, the answer is not explicitly stated. The text only discusses Peter Costello's *future* support for nuclear energy *if* it becomes economically viable. It doesn't explain why Australia currently lacks a nuclear energy industry.

Therefore, none of the options (A, B, C, or D) can be directly inferred from the text. However, given the context and the future conditionality placed by Costello, **D: meklefh lelghayh (Extremely costly)** is the most likely reason based on the provided information.  The text implies that if it weren't for economic considerations, Costello wouldn't object to nuclear energy.

This translates to ""The Polish skiers **Maciej Krezel** and Anna Ogarzynska ranked thirteenth in the Super-G race.""

The question asks which skier competed with a guide. The description ""al-mutazaliju"" which translates to ""skier"" gives us the correct answer of the Polish skier Maciej Krezel.

Therefore, the answer is C: Maciej Krezel.

However, of the options provided, Finland's Katja Saarinen was mentioned as occupying the same position as Holanda's Anna."

*   **D: qeyl lh enh men alemhetmel an yuresl ela alesjen (قيل له انه من المحتمل أن يرسل إلى السجن - He was told it is likely he will be sent to prison):** The text says ""Akhbar al-qadi al-sayed Blake bi anna """"al-mas2ala shibih 7atmiyya"""" wa sayatim ersaluhu ila assijin"" (Judge Mr. Blake was told that ""the matter is almost certain"" and he will be sent to prison).
*   **C: t'ered lelhejwem b'emewd (تعرض للهجوم بعمود - He was attacked with a pole):** The text states that the broadcaster *claimed* he used the pole to *defend* himself, not that he was attacked *with* a pole. He claimed he was defending himself against bottles.

Therefore, the only thing that the text **doesn't** say happened to Blake is that he was attacked with a pole. He claims he used it for self-defense."
ma aledy len yestekhedm feyh sendewq alahetbas alherarey aletab' lel-umam al-muta7ida?,"Let's analyze the text and the options.

The text states that the UN aims to finalize funding to help countries affected by global warming cope with its effects. It then provides examples of how the funds *could* be used:

*   Building flood-resistant homes.
*   Better water management.
*   Crop diversification.

Option A, ""tanwi3 al-ma7asil"" (crop diversification) is directly mentioned as a possible use.

Option C, ""manzil muqawima lil fayadanat"" (flood-resistant homes) is also directly mentioned as a possible use.

Option D, ""aletkhefyef men athar al-27tibas al-7arary al'ealemy"" (mitigating the effects of global warming) is the overall purpose of the fund, as stated in the text.  So, this is what the fund will be used for.

Option B, ""jelb al-ta8niyat limusa3adit adduwal annamiya"" (bringing technology to help developing countries) is connected to a *different* agenda item (""Bali"") related to saving forests and helping developing countries grow in a less polluting way. It is *not* described as a use for the fund to help countries cope with the effects of global warming.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B**.

"wefqaan llfqrh, ma aledy tamel alamem alemthedh fi eneqadh?","Based on the paragraph:

*   The paragraph mentions ""en8ath al-'3abat al-mutaba8iya fy al-3alm"" which translates to ""saving the remaining forests in the world.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: aleghabat alemteyrh alemtebqeyh** (The remaining rainforests)"

Here's why:

*   The text states: """"lam nasil ba3d ila itifaq 3ala qawa3ed al-mansha2 wa jalsat al-ta3rifa..."" This translates to ""We have not yet reached an agreement on rules of origin and tariff schedules...""

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: eda kanet benyen sewf tendem ela menteqh aletjarh alherh lelqarh aleferyeqyh** (Whether Benin will join the African Continental Free Trade Area): The text states Albert Mushanga announced that Benin *will* join. There is no doubt about it.
*   **B: aletareykh aledy yemken an tebda feyh aletjarh** (The date on which trade can begin): The text states that the work being undertaken is enough to begin trading on July 1, 2020. Although there are still items to be agreed upon, the date is set.
*   **C: qewa'ed alemnesha** (Rules of origin): The text explicitly says they have not yet reached an agreement on the rules of origin. While true, option D is better because tariff regulations are more closely related to the phrase ""jalsat al-ta3rifa,"" meaning tariff schedules. Tariff schedules would lay out the specific tariffs on goods, which is ""dewabet alet'ereyfh,"" meaning tariff regulations.

Therefore, **D** is the best answer as it is the most precise reflection of what the text says is still to be agreed upon."

Here's why:

The passage states,  ""Wa qala al-mufawwad: """"lam nasil ba3d ila itifaq 3ala qawa3ed al-mansha2 wa jalsat al-ta3rifa, laken al-3amal al-ladhi natabannah yakfi li bede2 al-tadawol fi al-awwal min Yulyo/Tammuz 2020."" This translates to: ""And the commissioner said: ""We have not yet reached an agreement on the rules of origin and the tariff schedule, but the work we are adopting is sufficient to start trading on the first of July.""

This directly supports answer B. While they haven't finalized everything, they have enough in place to begin trading. The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A:** While Nigeria joining is mentioned, the specific reason trade can begin in July is not *because* it was Nigeria's condition.
*   **C:** While the commissioner *announced* it, the reason isn't just because of his approval, but due to the existence of a sufficient framework.
*   **D:** The passage explicitly states they have *not* agreed on rules of origin and tariff schedules.

Here's why:

The paragraph states:

*   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution published a report showing problems in test results.
*   The report showed that test scores had increased rapidly.
*   The school discovered internal problems, but **did not take action** based on the findings.

Therefore, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution accused the education employees of failing to act to resolve the internal problems that were discovered."

Here's why:

*   **A: Thesn derjh alakhetbar gheyr al'eadey (Exceptional improvement in test scores):** The passage explicitly states that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported the rapid increase in test scores.
*   **C: Alefa'ez beja'ezh alemsherf alewteny 3la al3am l3am 2013 (Winner of the National Superintendent of the Year award for 2013):** The passage states that she won the award in 2009. The tampering was discovered in 2013.
*   **D: Aqetrahat beshan abetkar alta3lem alhedrey (Suggestions for innovative urban education):** The passage only states that she received a recognition for innovative urban education. It doesn't say that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution made any suggestions.

The newspaper report highlighted problems with test results but did not provide evidence of tampering. The evidence of tampering emerged later."
"wefqaan llfqrh, ma hey alema3elewmat alema3erewfh b3d aletfejyer?","The correct answer is **D: alhesyelh alersemyh lelqetla** (the official death toll).

*   The passage also notes ""illa anna al-arqam al-niha2iyya laysat wadi7a 7atta al-la7dha."" Which translates to ""but the final numbers are not clear at the moment"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: al3dd alenha'ey lelesabat** (the final number of injuries) is incorrect because the passage explicitly states that the final numbers (including injuries) are not yet clear.
*   **B: ay mebanen anefjert aleqnabel baleqreb menha** (which buildings the bombs exploded near) is mentioned (government buildings), but is not the most directly stated piece of known information.
*   **C: eda tem tefjeyr qenabel edafeyh** (if additional bombs were detonated) is not mentioned in the passage.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the given paragraph is the official death toll."

The building was hosting a large number of pilgrims arriving to visit the Grand Mosque (al-Haram al-Makki) on the eve of Hajj. Most of the hotel's guests were Emirati citizens. The death toll has reached at least 15, with expectations that this number will rise.

*   **Q (Arabic Question Translation):** Which sentence about the hotel guests is *incorrect* (i.e., not true)?

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: kan aledyewf fi mekh lada' feryedh alhej (The guests were in Mecca for the Hajj)** - This is **TRUE** according to the passage (""large number of pilgrims arriving to visit the Grand Mosque (al-Haram al-Makki) on the eve of Hajj."")

*   **B: b3d aledyewf leysewa mewatenyen mhelyeyn (Some of the guests were not local citizens)** - This is **TRUE**  The passage states, ""Most of the hotel's guests were Emirati citizens.""  ""Most"" implies that some were *not* Emirati.

*   **C: kan aledyewf henak 'esheyh alhej (The guests were there on the eve of Hajj)** - This is **TRUE**. The text says the fire happened on the ""eve of Hajj"".

*   **D: ghalebyh aledyewf kanewa men alemdeynh alemqedsh (The majority of the guests were from the holy city)** - This is **FALSE**. The passage specifically states that ""Most of the hotel's guests were Emirati citizens.""  Emirati citizens are not necessarily residents of Mecca itself.

Therefore, the answer is **D**."
"wefqaan llfqrh, ay men alejmel atalyh sheyh?","Based on the provided paragraph (P), the correct answer is **C: kan aledyewf henak 'esheyh alhej (The guests were there on the eve of Hajj)**.

*   **B: kan jami3 aledyewf men alemarat al'erebyh alemthedh (All the guests were from the United Arab Emirates)** - The paragraph states ""Kana aghlab nuzala2 hadha al-funduk muwatinin imaratiyyin"" (Most of the hotel guests were Emirati citizens), not *all* of them.
*   **D: kan ghalebyh aledyewf men sekan mekh alemhelyeyn (Most of the guests were local residents of Mecca)** - The paragraph states that most of them are Emiratis, therefore, it cannot be local residents."

*   It explicitly mentions that scientists are still trying to determine the size (A) and impact on Earth (C).
*   The U.S. Strategic Command is tracking debris (D), implying the location of the debris is known or being determined.

Now let's look at the options:

*   **A: hezr bey' aw tajeyr al'eab alefyedyew al3aneyfh lelqesr fi jami3 anha' California (Prohibition of the sale or rental of violent video games to minors throughout California)** This is directly mentioned in the text, so it *is* part of the bill.
*   **B: gheramat maleyh lelmekhalefyen (Financial penalties for violators)** The $1000 fine is a financial penalty, so this *is* part of the bill.
*   **C: hezr bey' aw tajeyr al'eab alefyedyew al3aneyfh lelqesr kharej California (Prohibition of the sale or rental of violent video games to minors outside of California)** The text only discusses California.
*   **D: ashetrat wed' melseq 3la alal'eab al3aneyfh (Requirement to place a sticker on violent games)** The requirement for an ""18"" sticker is part of the bill.

Therefore, the answer is **C: hezr bey' aw tajeyr al'eab alefyedyew al3aneyfh lelqesr kharej California** because the law pertains to California only."

*   The passage states that ""lam yatruk Duvall... intiba3an muhimman lada Miller..."" which translates to ""Duvall left an important impression on Miller"".
*   The question asks what applies to Miller's experience at the hearing.
*   Option A directly reflects the statement in the passage about Duvall's impact on Miller.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: lem yekn mentebhaan beynema kan yest'ed (She was not attentive while she was preparing):** While Miller mentions preparing, the core statement is about Duvall's impact. The lack of attention was *because* she was preparing, but the question focuses on her experience which *included* being impacted by Duvall.
*   **C: thedth tefla Duvall ketheyraan athena' jelsh alasetma' (Duvall's child spoke a lot during the hearing session):** The passage mentions Duvall is a father of two adult children, but there's nothing about a child speaking at the hearing.
*   **D: kan yewley ahetmamaan wetheyqaan leqsh Duvall (She was paying close and firm attention to Duvall's case):** The passage suggests the opposite; Miller wasn't listening closely to what Mike (presumably Duvall) was saying because she was preparing."

Even though it refers to the ""environmental protection law"" and the question asks about the ""clean air law"", the context suggests that Layton was advocating for environmental changes, making him the most likely person to propose changes in the broader environmental context.

This comparison focused on the *composition* or structure of the crystals.
*   The passage indicates that the crystals observed match the composition of crystals found in the urine of sick pets by comparing them using FTIR.
*   The other options are not directly what the FTIR analysis was used to observe:
    *   A: FTIR was not directly used to observe functions of the kidneys

*   The passage also mentions South Africa started poorly initially against its southern counterpart (""Wa badat janub afriqya hashatan amama shaqiqatihi al-janubiyyat..."").
*   The passage explicitly highlights their good teamwork (al-la3ib al-jama3i lil fariq), ball-handling skills (maharat al-ta7akkum bil kura), and strong defense (difaa3ahum al-mudham).

The first economic reforms were carried out under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping. Since then, the size of the Chinese economy has increased 90 times. For the first time last year, China exported more cars than Germany and surpassed the United States as the largest market for modern industries.

The prompt states: ""...the artists are engrossed in smoking cannabis on stage, and the theater itself encourages the audience to join them.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: anedm eleyhem 3la kheshebh alemserh lelada' (join them on stage to perform)**

While ""sharing cannabis"" might be implied, the specific action the prompt mentions the theater encourages is joining them on stage. The most accurate answer based on the text is C.
"

Therefore, ""neshat kharej alemrekbh"" (extravehicular activity) is the other name for ""As-sayr fi al-fada2"" (spacewalk).

The text states ""Ba3da 10 sanawat, qada jizi2 min al-iti7ad al-sovyeti min muhimmat Apollo-Soyuz..."". This translates to ""After 10 years, he spent part of the Soviet Union from the Apollo-Soyuz mission..."" which directly answers the question.
"

The passage states that Gibson was taken to the hospital after the accident but died shortly after. The truck driver was not injured, and while the children were scared, they ran away from the scene.
"

*   **""Ba3da wuqu3 al-7adith, tamma na8l Gibson ela al-mustashfa lakinahu tuwufiya ba3da thalika bi wa8tin 8asir""**: After the accident, Gibson was taken to the hospital, but he died shortly after.

Harabu jami3an min makan al-7adith.""**: A person who works in a garage near the accident site said, ""There were children waiting to cross the road, and they were all screaming and crying."" They all ran away from the accident scene.

The individuals involved in the accident are: Gibson, The Truck driver and Children

From the text, we know Gibson died and the truck driver had no injuries, and the children escaped without injuries, based on the text.
Therefore, the answer should be:
B: aseyb ahedhema, wetwefy alakher (One of them was injured, and the other died.)

**Important Note:** The children were witnesses and reacted emotionally by screaming and crying, but the important information is about the injured and died persons."

This translates to: ""The effect that the team was looking for resulted from the tidal force between the dark matter in the galaxy and the dark matter in the Milky Way galaxy.""

Therefore, the research program was focused on observing the effects of dark matter interaction."
kan al'elema' yelahezwen madh ayun men ataly?,"The correct answer is **D: mejrh aleqwes wemjerh derb aletbanh**

Here's why:

*   The passage clearly states that the team was looking for the tidal force between the dark matter in the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (majarrat al-qaws) and the dark matter in the Milky Way galaxy (majarrat darb at-tabbana).
*   It also mentions that the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, similar to the Moon's force on the Earth (causing tides).

Therefore, the scientists were observing the tidal effects between the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy and the Milky Way galaxy."
"bena'an 3la alfqrh, ma aledy la yenteqdh alemhafezwen?","Based on the paragraph, the answer is **B: qelh jhewd e'eadh ale'emar (lack of reconstruction efforts)**.

Here's why:

*   The paragraph states that conservatives sarcastically called the spending ""Bush's New Orleans Deal."" This implies they criticized the *amount* of spending.
*   It also mentions that a liberal critic focused on the fact that contracts were going to insiders, meaning they criticized *who* received the contracts.
*   Therefore, the paragraph implies the conservatives did not criticize the lack of reconstruction efforts."

The text states: ""Rakkaza al-naqed al-librali li juhud i3adat al-i3mar..."" which translates to ""The liberal critic focused on the reconstruction efforts..."". Therefore, the liberals are the ones criticizing the reconstruction contracts.

3la mada asethewdet eBay,"The passage P states that the company is aiming to gain popularity in regions where Skype dominates. The question Q asks what eBay acquired. The correct answer is therefore:

**C: Skype**

The passage states that the acquisition is aimed at gaining popularity in areas dominated by Skype. This implies that eBay acquired Skype (or is attempting to).
"

*   **B: aletwes' ela menateq jedyedh (Expand to new regions)** - The text explicitly states eBay wants to gain popularity in regions dominated by Skype, such as China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil.

Therefore, both A and B are correct based on the provided text. C could potentially be argued as a consequence of A and B, but A and B are the most direct answers to what eBay hopes to achieve through the acquisition. D is not mentioned or implied in the text.

"wefqaan llfqrh, men lm yetfa'el ma3 alesjena' aledyen beqwa fi alefna' b3d aleqtal?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: alemtefawedwen (the negotiators)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""La qad 7awala al-mufawidun tas7i7 al-wadi3 illa anna matilib al-sujana2 lam takun wadi7atan."" which translates to ""The negotiators tried to rectify the situation, but the prisoners' demands were not clear."" This indicates that the negotiators were attempting to engage with the prisoners. The phrase ""lam yetfa'el"" implies that they were not able to get through to the prisoners.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: tewaqem ferq aleneqad (rescue teams):** The rescue team was responsible for putting out the fire.
*   **C: debat alesherth (police officers):** Police officers entered the courtyard and used tear gas on the prisoners.
*   **D: taqem alemsetshefa (hospital staff):** The hospital staff received and treated the injured."

Here's why:

* The passage states that after the fighting stopped, inmates refused to return to their cells.  Negotiations didn't work because their demands were unclear. Then, officers equipped with riot gear entered and cornered the inmates with tear gas.  The tear gas is the direct cause for the inmates relenting.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: alemfawedat alnaje7h (Successful negotiations)** The passage says negotiations failed.
*   **C: alezmela' alesjena' alejrha (Injured inmate colleagues)** This might be a factor in the overall situation, but the passage doesn't explicitly say it caused the inmates to give up the protest.
*   **D: heryeq (Fire)** While the fire occurred, it was put out by the rescue team, not by the inmates themselves, and it wasn't the direct cause of the prisoners returning to their cells. The arrival of officers and tear gas was the reason they returned to their cells."

*   **B: alemmethelwen aledyen yerselhem alemreshhewn (representatives sent by candidates):** The passage states that candidates can send representatives to monitor the election process.
*   **C: aletweqy' 3la qa'emh aletsewyet (signing the voting list):** The passage mentions that voters sign the voting list after placing their ballot in the box.
*   **D: ferz memthelw alemreshheyn lelasewat (sorting of representatives of the candidates for votes):** The passage states that vote counting is done by volunteers, not representatives of the candidates.

Therefore, the only option that is NOT part of the voting process in France, according to the passage, is the sorting of votes by representatives of the candidates."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 3la qa'emh aletsewyet (على قائمة التصويت)** - On the voting list. The passage indicates that the voter signs the voting list, but doesn't indicate a choice on it
*   **C: 3la mezrewf (على مغلف)** - On an envelope. The voter places the pre-printed paper *inside* the envelope, but the choice is not written directly *on* the envelope.
*   **D: 3la alh dakhel keshek (على الله داخل كشك)** - On God inside a booth. There is no mention of ""God"" in the passage. The voter goes into a small room/booth to make their choice privately."

The passage states: ""Wa tu3tabaru Allen i7da athriya2 al-3alam wa qad **istathmara al-kathir min tharwatihi fi al-istikshaf al-ba7ri**..."" which means ""Allen is considered one of the richest people in the world and has **invested a lot of his wealth in marine exploration**...""

Therefore, option B is the best answer.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that authorities suspect the spent fuel rods, containing uranium fuel, may have leaked and exploded. This directly implies a dangerous situation.
*   While Cesium and Iodine were detected, their presence is an indicator of a problem, but not the root cause of the potential explosion.
*   White smoke and the presence of Cesium and Iodine might indicate a dangerous event that is happening, however, if it is uranium fuel that may have exploded, this will cause more damage.
*   Therefore, the most likely cause of a dangerous situation in the factory and its surroundings, according to the paragraph, is uranium fuel."
ay mema yely leys men nesa'eh aleslamh alemqetrhh lelsekan alemhelyeyn b3d alhadeth fi alemsen'e?,"The correct answer is **C: tejneb asetneshaq aledkhan alabeyd (Avoid inhaling the white smoke)**

Here's why:

The passage directly states:

*   ""al-sultat al-ma7aliyya al-sukkan fi mu7it al-masna3 min al-baqa2 fi manadhilihim"" - Authorities warned residents to not remain in their homes.
*   ""an yutfi2u al-mukayifat"" - to turn off air conditioners.
*   ""3adam al-shurub min as-sanbur"" - and not to drink tap water.

Therefore:

*   **A (tejneb asetkhedam whedat tekyeyf alhewa' / Avoid using air conditioning units)** is mentioned.
*   **B (alebqa' fi aledakhel / Staying indoors)** is *not* a recommendation, but the opposite. The residents were asked *not* to stay indoors.
*   **C (tejneb asetneshaq aledkhan alabeyd / Avoid inhaling the white smoke)** is a logical inference. The presence of white smoke indicates potential contaminants in the air. While it's not stated explicitly, it's implied.
*   **D (alametna' 3an sherb meyah alesnebwer / Abstaining from drinking tap water)** is mentioned.

Therefore, C is the *least likely* of the Islamic advice proposed to local residents. It is more than likely a general piece of advice that anyone might give in that situation. However, the question implies a Islamic piece of advice, which this would not be.

The other options are incorrect because:

Here's why:

*   The passage states NextGen allows air traffic controllers to ""identify aircraft with greater precision"" (bi ta7did al-ta2irat bi deqqah akbar). This directly translates to more precise aircraft locations.

The other options are benefits of the system as a whole, but the question asks about direct benefits to air traffic controllers:
*   A: Shorter flight paths (terq teyran aqesr) - benefit to airlines and passengers.
*   C: Reduced carbon emissions (khefd aneb'eathat alekrebwen) - benefit to the environment.

*   Focusing resources on cases of stolen cars to boost their success rate (mentioned directly in the first sentence).

The text states that Congress started funding anti-corruption initiatives and mandated the FBI to allocate agents to adult pornography cases. While this implies a shift in focus towards pornography, it doesn't state that historians *criticized* the FBI *specifically* for focusing on pornography cases.

Therefore, the answer is **A: t'ezeyz ma3edel nejahhem** (boosting their success rate). The historians criticized *how* they were boosting their success rate (by focusing on easy cases), not necessarily the *idea* of boosting their success rate itself."

The officials' concern that the ship might ""unload its cargo"" implies that their primary worry was the potential for a fuel spill or leak. Therefore, option C best reflects the primary concern."
"wefqaan llfqrh, ay men alejmel atalyh 7wl thekm lewnew gheyr sheyh?","Let's analyze the provided text and the options:

The text translates to something like this:

""The fuel tanker Luno was carrying 120-160 cubic meters of fuel on board and malfunctioned, and was pushed by strong winds and waves to the breakwater. Helicopters rescued the twelve crew members, and the only injury was a broken nose. The ship, which is 100 meters long, was on its way to transport its usual cargo of fertilizers, and officials initially feared that the ship might discharge its cargo.""

Now let's consider the options:

*   **A: hedth alethetm qebl aletqat alhemwelh (The incident happened before the cargo was unloaded)** - The text mentions that the ship was *on its way* to transport fertilizers (its usual cargo). Also, the officials were afraid that the ship *might* discharge its cargo, indicating that it hadn't yet.

*   **B: kan 3la metn alesfeynh 100 metr men alewqewd weqt alethetm (There were 100 meters of fuel on board the ship at the time of the incident)** - This is incorrect. The text states the ship was carrying 120-160 *cubic meters* of fuel, not 100 *meters*. Also, the 100 meters stated refers to the length of the ship, not the fuel.

*   **C: men beyn atheny 'esher men aferad aletaqem, aseyb wahed (Among the twelve crew members, one was injured)** - This is correct. The text states that the only injury was a broken nose among the twelve crew members.

*   **D: duf3at alsafynh ela 7ajez al-amwaj (The ship was pushed to the breakwater)** - This is also correct. The text states that the ship was pushed by strong winds and waves to the breakwater.

Therefore, options C and D are both correct and the closest to the content of the paragraph. Options A is probably true as well since officials fear the ship *might* discharge its cargo which means it had not discharged it yet. Only option B is definitively false, so the correct answer is to choose either C, D or A.

Since both C and D are true, the answer could be either but typically, a more **direct** statement based on the text is preferable. In this case, C is slightly more direct since it mentions the specific number of people and the exact injury. D is a bit more general.

Therefore, the answer is **C**."
fi ay 3aqd 7aslat Al-Jaza2ir 3la alastqelal?,"The correct answer is **C: alesteyneyat (the sixties)**.

The text mentions that Vautier returned to newly independent Algeria in the sixties. This implies that Algeria gained its independence in the sixties.
"
ayen lm yetm terkeyb shashat aletlefzeywen lemrasem alejnazh?,"Let's break down the Arabic text and the question:

* **P (Text):** ""More than four million people went to Rome to attend the funeral. The number of attendees was so large that it was not possible for everyone to reach the funeral in St. Peter's Square. Several large television screens were installed in different places in Rome to allow the public to watch the mourning. Similar preparations were made in many other cities in Italy and in the rest of the world, especially in Poland, which was witnessed by a large number of people.""

* **Q (Question):** ""Where were television screens NOT installed for the funeral ceremony?""

Now let's analyze the answer choices:

* **A: jami3 anha' rewma (All parts of Rome):** The text says screens were in *different places* in Rome, not necessarily ALL places. So, this is a possibility for the correct answer.
* **B: fi medn eyetaleyh mekhetlefh (Different cities in Italy):** The text explicitly states screens were set up in other Italian cities. So, this is incorrect.
* **C: fi mewaq' ma3eyenh fi bewlenda (Specific places in Poland):** The text states similar preparations (including screens) were made in Poland. So, this is incorrect.
* **D: fi sa7et alqdeys btrus (St. Peter's Square):** The text implies that the screens were NOT installed IN St. Peter's Square because not everyone could fit there. The screens were installed elsewhere in Rome to allow those who couldn't get into the square to watch.

Therefore, the best answer is **D: fi sa7et alqdeys btrus (St. Peter's Square)**.
"
ayen aqeymet merasem alejnazh?,"The correct answer is **C: fi sa7et alqdeys btrus** (في ساحة القديس بطرس), which translates to ""in Saint Peter's Square.""

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states ""...lam yakun minal mumkin lil jami3 al-wusul ila al-janaza fi sa7at al-qiddis Butros,"" meaning ""it was not possible for everyone to reach the funeral in Saint Peter's Square."" This implies the funeral itself was held there.

While the passage also mentions screens in other locations in Rome and other cities, the *actual funeral* was at Saint Peter's Square.
"
"b3d alanefjar, men aledy 'ewelj men esabat khetyerh?","The correct answer is **B: la ahed (لا أحد)**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Lam tarid anba2 3an wu8u3 e9abat kha6yratan"" which translates to ""There were no reports of serious injuries.""
* Option A, ""3la alaqel khemsh ashekhas (على الأقل خمسة أشخاص),"" translates to ""at least five people."" While five people were treated for shock, they did not sustain *serious injuries*.
* Options C and D are incorrect because the text mentions these individuals being at the location and/or reporting the gas leak, but not being injured.
"

The passage states: ""Wa qad wasala mas2ul bi-sharikat a;-ghaz ila makan al-7adith ba3da  2an itasala a7ad al-jiran bi sha2n tasarub lil ghaz.""  This translates to: ""And an official from the gas company arrived at the scene after a neighbor reported a gas leak.""

The text states: ""A5faqa sila7 Uka bynama kana musawabban 3ala ra2isi rajoulen 5amsiniy."" This translates to ""Uka's weapon failed while it was pointed at the head of a man in his fifties."" This clearly indicates that Uka's weapon failed to fire.
"

Therefore, the correct answer is C: 14
"

The passage states that France is the seventh country in the European Union to suffer from the H5N1 virus, after Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Italy. Therefore, there are seven countries identified with the virus.
"
ayen tem alet'eref 3la ahedth halh men feyrews H5N1?,"The correct answer is **A: farnsa** (France).

The text states that a case of H5N1 avian influenza was found in Lyon, eastern France. It also mentions that France is the seventh European Union country to be affected by this virus.

This translates to ""Haiti had no problems related to the disease since the 1800s, that is, before the arrival of the forces.""  The 1800s refers to the 19th century.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: aleqren aletas' 'esher (The 19th Century)**.

(The blame was placed on the peacekeepers...for the outbreak of the disease that started from *their camp*). It also states that the waste wasn't properly disinfected from the UN camp.
"
ma aledy tekhett alhekwemh alayerlendeyh lef'elh?,"Let's analyze the passage and the options:

The passage indicates that the Iranian government is emphasizing the necessity of a parliamentary law to ""correct the situation.""  The government spokesperson states it's necessary from a public health and criminal justice perspective to pass legislation as soon as possible. The Health Minister expresses concern over the well-being of individuals benefiting from the temporary legality of certain substances, and condemns drug-related convictions that have occurred since unconstitutional changes took effect.

Based on this, the government seems to want to rectify what it perceives as a problem related to current drug laws. The existing situation is described as:

*   Having a temporary legality for ""certain substances.""
*   Resulting in ""unconstitutional changes"" that have led to drug-related convictions.

Given this context, let's look at the answer choices:

*   **A: tewzey' aledanat 3la mertekbey jera'em alemkhedrat** - This translates to ""Distributing convictions to perpetrators of drug crimes."" The passage mentions existing convictions that the Health Minister is concerned about because of the ""unconstitutional changes"". This does not reflect what the government intends to do.
*   **B: sen qewaneyn akether seramh beshan sama7eyh alemkhedrat** - This translates to ""Enacting stricter laws regarding the permissibility of drugs."" This aligns with the government's stated goal to ""correct the situation"" and the Health Minister's concern about the temporary legality and existing convictions.
*   **C: tekhefyef aleqwaneyn alemt'eleqh besmaheyh alemkhedrat** - This translates to ""Easing laws related to the permissibility of drugs."" This is the opposite of what the passage suggests.
*   **D: elegha' tejreym alemkhedrat** - This translates to ""Abolishing the criminalization of drugs."" The government wants to ""correct the situation,"" which suggests they do not want to abolish the criminalization of drugs.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.
**Final Answer: B**"
ma aledy kan qanewneyaan ma3eqetaan fi ayerlenda?,"Let's break down the Arabic text and the question.

The passage discusses the Iranian government emphasizing the need for parliamentary legislation to rectify a situation. The government spokesperson said it's necessary to pass legislation quickly from a public health and criminal justice perspective. The Minister of Health expressed concern about the well-being of individuals benefiting from the *temporary* legality of certain substances and about drug-related convictions that have occurred since ""unconstitutional changes"" came into effect.

The question asks: ""What was legally and ethically acceptable in Ireland yesterday?""  However, the Arabic text makes absolutely no mention of Ireland or anything legally/ethically acceptable within Ireland. Therefore, there is no way of definitively answering the question based on the text provided.

**Therefore, none of the answers (A, B, C, or D) can be definitively determined to be correct based on the provided Arabic text.**

"3nd tegheyyer alelafeth, ma aledy lm yef'elh alemshetbh bh?","The correct answer is **C: elhaq derr madey bha (inflicted material damage on it)**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Lam tata3arrad al-3alama madiyyan"" which translates to ""The sign was not damaged materially."" This means no material damage occurred.
* The other options were mentioned:
    * Changed some of its letters: ""...li taghyir al-7arif """"O"""" li qira2at al-7arif al-saghira """"e"""" (…to change the letter ""O"" to read as the lowercase letter ""e"").""
    * Decorated it with a peace sign: ""...bi-istikhdam ak-qumash al-aswad al-muzayyan bi-3alamt al-salam (…by using black fabric decorated with a peace sign).""

*   **Printing unauthorized advertisements:** ""2etahamathu madrasat Modern Education bi tiba3at e3lanat kabirah 3ala al-7afilat min dun tasri7"" - This corresponds to option C (teba'eh ale3lanat gheyr alemsemwh bha).

*   **Teaching dating skills:** ""3alim maharat al-muwa3ada fi al-mulaha'6at"" - This corresponds to option B (mewa'edh talebh)

Therefore, all options were accusation against Karno. I cannot pick an answer as suggested."
"wefqaan llfqrh, men lm yuakhed rheynh men qebl rewlanedw meynedweza?","Based on the paragraph, the answer is **B: rejal sherth (Police officers)**.

The paragraph states that tourists (suyya7), including children (atfal) and photographers (musawiroun), were taken hostage. There is no mention of police officers being taken hostage.
"
"bena'an 3la alfqrh, ay alerha3an lm yetm aletaked men etelaq serahhem mebkeraan?","The correct answer is **A: alesa'ehewn** (the tourists).

The paragraph states that:

*   Some hostages were rescued.
*   Six hostages died.
*   Six hostages were released, including children and elderly people, and Filipino photographers.

Since the text explicitly mentions the release of children, elderly, and Filipino photographers, but *not* the tourists directly, and also states that 6 died and some were only rescued, we can infer that the tourists were the ones whose release wasn't confirmed early.
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, men aledy yejma3 aletweqy'eat led'em teqneyn zewaj alemthelyeyn fi alebrazeyl?","The correct answer is **A: al-mu7tajjun (al-mu7tajjun)**, which translates to ""the protesters"".

This translates to: ""And the proposed legislation, after its amendment, hopes that the protestors will collect a petition of 1.2 million signatures to present it to the National Congress in November.""

Therefore, the protesters are the ones collecting the signatures to support legalizing same-sex marriage in Brazil.
"

*   The text explicitly states: ""Ba3d khamsi daqa2iq min al-3ard, tabda2 al-riya7 fi al-dawaran, wa ba3da 7wali daqiqa tasilu al-riya7 ila 70 kilometer bi-sa3a..."" (After five minutes from the show, the wind starts to spin, and after about a minute the wind reaches 70 kilometers per hour). This clearly indicates strong winds preceded the chaos.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: kan al'ered metakheraan khems deqa'eq (The show was five minutes late)**: While true that the events started 5 minutes after the show began, this wasn't the direct trigger for people's panicked reaction to the weather.
*   **A: bedat alethelwej (It started snowing)**: While the text mentions hail falling, it doesn't say it started snowing.
*   **D: feqd ather ahed aferad alaserh (Lost track of a family member)**: While Armand Versace lost his sister and her friend, this happened *during* the chaos, not before. The events described are what caused him to lose track of them."
"wefqaan le Versace, meta bedat aqewa aleryah?","The correct answer is **A: b3d deqa'eq qelyelh men bed' al'ered** which translates to ""After a few minutes from the start of the show"".

The passage states: ""Ba3d khamsi daqa2iq min al-3ard, tabda2 al-riya7 fi al-dawaran..."" meaning ""After five minutes of the show, the wind starts to turn...""

Option A is the closest and correct interpretation.

This translates to: ""Fred is the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded south and east in the Atlantic Ocean since the appearance of satellite imagery, and only the **third major cyclone ever recorded east of 35 degrees west.**""

Therefore, if Fred is the third, there must have been two previous ones.
"
"3anedma kan feryed mewjewdaan baleqreb men jezr aleras alakhedr, fi ay atejah kan yetjh?","The correct answer is **D: shemal gherbey (Northwest)**.

"
ma hew derwery leky yekwen 802.11n metwafeqaan ma3 802.11b?,"The correct answer is **D: ajhezh radeyw mezdewjh (Dual radio devices)**

Here's why:

* **The text states explicitly:** ""Wa sayasma7u lahu dhalika bi-an yakuna mutwafiqan ma3a kullen min 802.11a wa 802.11b wa 802.11g bi-sharit an ta7tawi al-ma7atta al-asasiyya 3ala ajhizat radio muzdawija."" This translates to: ""And that will allow it to be compatible with all of 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g, provided that the base station contains dual radio devices.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ser'eat aser' bektheyr (Faster speed):** While 802.11n is faster, this is not a *requirement* for compatibility. It's a benefit of the new standard.
*   **B: aleqderh 3la teshegheyl 802.11b 3la 5.0 jeyghahertez (The ability to run 802.11b on 5.0 GHz):** 802.11b only operates on the 2.4 GHz band.
*   **C: natej 600 meyghabeyt fi alethaneyh (600 megabits per second output):** This is the *maximum theoretical speed* of 802.11n, not a condition for compatibility.

Therefore, the presence of dual radio devices is what enables 802.11n to be compatible with older standards like 802.11b.

He was unable to take the necessary medications to overcome his pain as they were prohibited during the games.
* **Q:** How many events did the first gold medal-winning swimmer have to swim in the Commonwealth Games?

The first sentence in P clearly states: ""He was determined to become the person who holds the gold medal in the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle swimming..."". This refers to two separate events: 100-meter freestyle and 200-meter freestyle.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Athenan (two)**.

In addition to carrying three important scientific instruments, the lunar probe also carried a rendering of the Indian national flag on all sides.""

Now let's analyze the options:

*   **A: The orbital vehicle that launched the probe had a crew.**  The original text explicitly states that the spacecraft was ""without a crew."" Thus, this statement is false.
*   **B: The probe contained biological instruments.**  The original text only mentions ""three important scientific instruments,"" but not specifically biological instruments. This statement could be false.
*   **C: The probe's launch was successful.** The original text explicitly states that the probe ""successfully landed."" Thus, this statement is true.
*   **D: The sides of the probe contained drawings.** The original text states that it carries ""a rendering of the Indian national flag on all sides."" This statement is true.

So, the incorrect statement is A.

**Therefore, the answer is A.**"
ay men al'ebarat atalyh tesf alemsebar aleqmery bedqh?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is:

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: hebt baleqreb men aleqteb aleshemaley lelqemr (هبط بالقرب من القطب الشمالي للقمر) - Landed near the North Pole of the moon:** The passage states it landed near the *South* Pole.
*   **C: tem etelaqh men merkebh medareyh ma7wlh (تم إطلاقه من مركبة مدارية مأهولة) - It was launched from a manned orbital vehicle:** The passage states it was launched from an unmanned vehicle.

While other measures like insecticide spraying ( المبيدات الحشرية - similar to option A) and culling pigs (صيد الخنازير - similar to option B) were mentioned, the vaccine deployment was explicitly stated to be delayed due to funding and prioritization issues. Therefore, it's the final action to be implemented eventually, once those issues are resolved.
"

This translates to: ""A change was made during **this legislative session** when the second sentence was deleted, first by the House of Representatives and then approved by the Senate in a similar manner on Monday.""

Therefore, the second sentence was deleted during a legislative session, and it was approved by the senate on Monday.

*   The other options describe incidents with significantly fewer fatalities:
    *   Helicopter crash: 3 deaths
    *   Plane crash in Mashhad: 17 deaths

*   **A: enteqad alesyash alhaleyh (Criticism of the current policy):** The passage states that the report strongly criticizes almost every aspect of the executive branch's current policy in dealing with Iraq. So, this *was* included.

*   **C: tewseyat letameyn hedwed al'eraq (Recommendations to secure Iraq's borders):** The passage mentions a recommendation for a new diplomatic initiative to secure Iraq's borders against hostile interventions. So, this *was* included.

The paragraph states that Provenzano curbed the excesses of these leaders by putting an end to the war led by Riina against the state, which resulted in the deaths of the anti-mafia judges Giovanni Falcone and Paola Borsellino in 1992. Therefore, Falcone's death was a consequence of the war led by Riina.

Since the question asks when Alonso stopped relative to the other driver, the best answer is **C: b3d an anha Schumacher sebaqh** (after Schumacher ended his race).

*   The passage mentions that ""afdal film"" was a nomination, so A is incorrect

The paragraph explicitly states that the combined user base of Yahoo and Microsoft will rival AOL's user base. This means they will be competing with AOL. Therefore, C is the correct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: mn almrj7 an yzdad 3dd mst5dmy AOL** (It is likely that the number of AOL users will increase) - The paragraph implies the opposite; competition will challenge AOL's dominance.
* **B: stkwn AOL alshrkh alwhydh alty twrt swq alrsa2el alfwryh** (AOL will be the only company that developed the instant messaging market) - While AOL pioneered IM, the paragraph suggests their lead is being challenged.

**Understanding the Argument**

The paragraph says:

*   AOL was successful in IM development because of its wide use in America.
*   This widespread use now necessitates regulation or restriction (the ""tadbir"" implies a control mechanism). This signals that the freedom they had will be terminated.
*   Yahoo and Microsoft combined have fewer users than AOL.

**Analyzing the Options**

*   **A: t6wer alentrnet 3la nta8 wase3 fi alwlayat almthdh (Broad internet development in the United States)** This is unlikely to end. The argument centers on *regulation* of IM services, not the internet itself.

*   **B: ast5dam sw8 alrsa2el alfwryh (The use of instant messaging)** This is also unlikely to end. The regulation is intended to control its development, not eliminate it entirely.

*   **C: huryh AOL fi t6wer alsw8 bwtyrteha al5ash (AOL's freedom to develop the market at its own pace/in its own way)** This is the **most likely** consequence. The statement explicitly says taking measures to end a prior freedom. The prompt says this termination of freedom is necessary.

*   **D: shrakhet Yahoo wa Microsoft (Yahoo and Microsoft)** This is unlikely to happen. This is a statement of fact and not connected to the decision to enact regulation.

**Conclusion**

The argument claims that AOL's freedom to develop its IM services as it wishes will likely end due to new regulations arising from its dominance. Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer.

* The question asks where the work appeared *before* 2015.
* AstroNet Radio was established in late 2015, so it's irrelevant.
* East Texas is where the actors were from, but not a platform.
* While it *was* a local radio station platform, only ""TogiNet Radiu"" is mentioned explicitly.

Here's why:

*   **B is a direct fact from the passage:** The passage states, ""Fashilat 45 min 117 mutazalija fi siba9 Jiant Slalom min ta78i8 tartib fi al-siba8"" which translates to ""45 of 117 skiers failed in the Giant Slalom race to achieve a ranking in the race."" Implying they did not finish.

Let's examine why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: fi alsbaq althany, anht Carpenado qbl mtzljh mn al-Majar:** (In the second race, Carpenado finished before a skier from Hungary.) This is incorrect. The passage states Carpenado finished *behind* the Hungarian skier (Gyöngyi Dani).
*   **C: anha 3dd akbr mn almtzljat sbaq altzlj Giant Slalom m8arnh m3 sbaq altzlj Slalom:** (A greater number of skiers completed the Giant Slalom race compared to the Slalom race.) This is incorrect. 36 out of 116 did not finish the Slalom, while 45 out of 117 did not finish the Giant Slalom. Therefore, more skiers completed the Slalom than the Giant Slalom.
*   **D: anht Carpenado fi almrtbh al3eashrh fi sbaq altzlj Slalom:** (Carpenado finished in tenth place in the Slalom race.) This is incorrect. Carpenado did not finish the Slalom race. She finished tenth in the Giant Slalom."

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the NBA suspended its basketball season. The reason behind the suspension was a player testing positive for COVID-19, but the *season* itself was the thing put on hold.
*   While the other options are related to the context, the passage says the **season** was suspended."

"wfqaan llfa8arh, ay mn aljml altalyh tsf bdqh t3eamlat mjmw3eh Virgin m3 bank Northern Rock?","The correct answer is **None of the above**

Let's break down why and what the correct answer should be based on the text:

*   **A: ashtrt mjmw3eh Virgin shrkh edarh alaswl altab3eh le Northern Rock (Virgin Group bought the asset management company affiliated with Northern Rock):** The text states that Virgin bought the *profitable* assets, not the ""asset management"" company specifically, and explicitly *didn't* buy the assets that were being managed (the ""bad"" assets). So this is incorrect.
*   **B: ashtrt mjmw3eh Virgin al-bank b3d ta2mymh (Virgin Group bought the bank after its nationalization):** The text indicates Virgin bought *assets* after the split, not the entire bank. This is wrong.
*   **C: 2rdt mjmw3eh Virgin d3m altwar2 ll bank khlal azmh alrhn al3a8ary (Virgin Group offered emergency support to the bank during the mortgage crisis):** The text states that Richard Branson made a bid *for the bank*, not that he offered emergency support. The bank ultimately accepted government support. This is incorrect.
*   **D: tm tqdym 3rd mjmw3eh Virgin alawl ll bank b3d ta2mym albank (Virgin Group's first offer to the bank was made after the bank was nationalized):** The text states that Virgin made an offer *before* nationalization. This is incorrect.

A more accurate statement based on the paragraph would be:

"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma hy aldwlh alty tta2thr btw8y3 atfaqyh Kyoto llmna5?","The correct answer is **A: alwlayat almthdh (The United States)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that after Mr. Rudd signs the Kyoto Protocol, the United States will become the **only** developed nation not to ratify the agreement. This implies that the US is negatively impacted by the signing, because it becomes isolated in its stance. The passage specifically mentions that Australia ratified the agreement.
"

While NPWS and national parks and wildlife services are partners in the wider project, the *specific program* that recruited the volunteers was under the Sports Shooters Association.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated (""jara muraqabat al-tajriba wa taqyim fa3aliyyatiha""). Therefore, option A directly contradicts the information provided in the passage.

The other options are consistent with the passage:

*   **B: tlqa almtlqwn ershadat tdrybyh** (The shooters received training guidance) - The passage mentions that the four shooters received comprehensive safety instructions and training (""talaqqaw ta3limat shamila 7awla assalama wal tadrib"").
*   **C: ashrf alhras 3la almtlqyn** (The guards supervised the shooters) - The passage states that the forest guard should have supervised the shooters (""Laqad kana yajeb an yushref 7aras al-ghabat..."").
*   **D: tm akhtyar arb3 syadyn** (Four hunters were chosen) - The passage explicitly mentions that four shooters were selected (""arrumat al-arba3a al-ladhina tamma i5tiyaruhum"")."
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ayn 3uthr 3la alanshqaq?","The correct answer is **D: fi Ethiopia**.

"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma aldy 7dth fi wqt abkr mma kan mtwq8eaan?","The correct answer is **B: alanshqaq (The Rift)**.

Here's why:

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: aktshaf alhfryh (Discovery of the fossil):** While the fossil discovery led to the conclusion, the *rift* is what happened earlier than expected, not the discovery itself.
* **C: t7lyl aldlyl aljzy2ey (Analysis of the molecular evidence):** The passage states the rift was earlier than *expected based on molecular evidence*.

*   Reports then indicated the plane received a bomb threat and was diverted to Afghanistan to land in Kandahar.
*   Initial reports indicate the plane's course was changed to Afghanistan after being prevented from an emergency landing in Urumqi.

Now let's examine the answer choices:

*   A:  tlqt al6a2erh thdydaan bwjwd qnblh (The plane received a bomb threat) - This **IS** mentioned in the text.
*   B: hb6t alta2erh fi Urumqi (The plane landed in Urumqi) - The text says it was prevented from landing in Urumqi and diverted to Afghanistan. So this did **NOT** happen.
*   C: tm t7wyl msar alta2erh ela Afghanistan (The plane's course was changed to Afghanistan) - This **IS** mentioned in the text.
*   D: hb6t alta2erh fi Kandahar (The plane landed in Kandahar) - This **IS** mentioned in the text.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: hb6t alta2erh fi Urumqi** because the report specifically indicates the plane did *not* land in Urumqi."
ma aldy lm yrd fi altqryr alawl lwkalh anba2 Xinhua?,"Based on the passage, the first report from Xinhua only mentioned the *possibility* of a hijacking. It was later reports that confirmed the plane received a bomb threat and was diverted.

Therefore, the answer is **A: tm akhttaf alta2erh (The plane was hijacked)**.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: mun3et alta2erh mn alhbwt aladtrary (The plane was prevented from landing)**: This is mentioned in the passage (""muni3at min al-hubut adtirari fi Urumqi"").

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Sara Danius announced the committee has given up trying to reach Bob Dylan after failing to contact him about his Nobel Prize win.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: alfa2ez bja2ezh Nobel ll2dab** (Winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature): While relevant, this is already known and not the specific announcement made during the radio program.
*   **B: lm ttlq alljnh ay rdwd mn almt3eawnyn** (The committee did not receive any responses from the collaborators): The passage actually says his close associates responded ""in a very friendly way.""

This translates to: ""The Ninth Ward is currently located, which witnessed floods up to 20 feet high during Hurricane Katrina, in water exceeding the height of the nearby dam.""

Therefore, the cyclone was expected to weaken *after* it had already been at 83 km/h. Since the peak of the storm was mentioned before the decreasing wind speed, the weakening would have to occur after that point.

*   A: qbl alwswl ela al-Maldives - Before reaching the Maldives: The text only mentions the origin of the name of the cyclone, not it's final path or its weakening. We don't have information about the location of the Maldives, so we cannot determine a timeline based on it.
*   B: 3ndma ankhfdt sr3eh alryah ela hwaly 83 kilometer fi alsa3a - When the wind speed decreased to about 83 kilometers per hour: The text says that at 83 km/h it was expected to continue decreasing.
*   C: qbl an ysl ela drwth - Before it reached its peak: Incorrect, since the storm would have to weaken after its peak.
*   D: qbl wswl sr3eh alryah ela 149 mylaan fi alsa3a - Before the wind speed reached 149 miles per hour: Incorrect, since the storm would have to weaken after its peak.

**Therefore, the correct answer is B: 3ndma ankhfdt sr3eh alryah ela hwaly 83 kilometer fi alsa3a (When the wind speed decreased to about 83 kilometers per hour).**"
ma hy sr3eh alryah fi drwh e3sar jwnw almdary?,"The correct answer is **C: 149 mile fi alsa3a**.

The text states ""Balagha al-i3sar al-istiwa2i Gonu fi dhurwatihi riya7an mutawasila wasalat sur3atuha ila 240 kilometran fi sa3a (149 milan fi sa3a)."" This translates to ""Tropical Cyclone Gonu reached its peak with sustained winds reaching speeds of 240 kilometers per hour (149 miles per hour)."" The question asks about the wind speed *at the peak* of the cyclone.
"
ay mma yly la y3etbr mn khasyat Karenia brevis?,"The correct answer is **C: hw mt3edd alkhlaya (It is multicellular)**.

The passage clearly states that Karenia brevis is a *ka2in ba7riy wa7id al-khaliyya* which translates to *a marine single-celled organism*. Therefore, it is NOT multicellular.
"
ay mma yly la ystty3 Karenia brevis alqyam bh?,"The correct answer is **B: alzyadh alsry3eh fi al3edd t7t ay zrf** (rapid increase in numbers under any circumstances).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that natural factors can *allow* for rapid increases in algae numbers, implying that specific conditions are needed.  It doesn't say it can happen under *any* circumstances.
*   The passage says it produces neurotoxins that affect humans and fish (A and D are correct).
*   The passage implies that the algae affect the water when it causes fish to die (C is correct)."

It caused rain across the island, but *no damage or flooding was reported*.  The rain was considered ""beneficial"" and accompanied by thunderstorms and frequent lightning.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **D: fydanat alshware3 (Flooding of streets)**

The passage explicitly states that there were no reports of any damage or floods. The other options (beneficial rain, rain with thunder, frequent lightning) are all mentioned as occurring."

Here's why:

The passage states that Hurricane Felicia *weakened* to a tropical depression. This implies it was a hurricane *first* and then became a tropical depression. Option B suggests the opposite, making it false.

The other options are true based on the passage:

*   **A: astfadt Oahu mn htwl alamtar alnatj** (Oahu benefited from the resulting rainfall) - The passage states that the rainfall was considered ""beneficial"" on Oahu.
*   **C: shhdt m3ezm aljzr htwl alamtar** (Most of the islands experienced rainfall) - The passage explicitly mentions that the remnants caused rain on most of the island.
*   **D: htwl b3d alamtar mshwbh bbrq** (Some of the rainfall was accompanied by lightning) - The passage says the rain was accompanied by thunderstorms and frequent lightning."

The passage states that Piquet Jr. was fired after the Hungarian Grand Prix of 2009. ""Disqualified"" is a suitable translation.
"
mta wq3 al7adth?,"Based on the information in the provided passage, the correct answer is **A: mbashrh b3d twqf alwnsw (Immediately after Alonso's stop)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Piquet Jr. crashed after a sudden stop by Fernando Alonso. This crash led to the safety car being deployed. Therefore, the event (Piquet's crash) happened immediately after Alonso's stop.

The passage explicitly states that researchers originally believed the *evolution* of new species (ttwr alanwa3) took much longer than the two generations they observed on the Galapagos Islands. Therefore, the evolution of species took less time than originally thought.
"

The passage does **not** mention:

*   **C: asm alnw3 aljdyd (Name of the new species):** The passage doesn't provide a specific name for the new species.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: asm alnw3 aljdyd**."

The text states that Yu3rabaru al-hadath al-fanni (the art event) is part of Bucharest City Hall's campaign and that Bucharest will be the first city in southeastern Europe to host CowParade. This directly indicates that CowParade will take place in Bucharest.
"

* **The Arabic passage describes a liquid similar to water (""Sa-yatasarraf mithla al-ma2. Fa innahu shaffaf kama al-ma2 tamaman"" which translates to ""It behaves like water. It is transparent like water completely""). It talks about seeing objects on the bottom of a body of water (""Lidhalika idha kunta taqifu bi-janeb al-shati2 fa-satatamakkan min ru2yat ay 7asa aw mawad lazija mawjouda fil qa3"" which translates to ""Therefore, if you stand by the shore, you will be able to see any pebbles or sticky substances at the bottom""). It also mentions a planetary body exhibiting more dynamics than Titan, except for Mars (""Bi-qadri ma na3lamahu, hunaka jisim kawkabi wa7id faqat ya3ridu dinimakiyya akthar min Titan, wa ismuhu Kawkab al-Ared"" which translates to ""As far as we know, there is only one planetary body that exhibits more dynamics than Titan, and that's Mars"").**

"
ayun mn hdh alnta2ej lyst ntyjh aktshaf alrysh?,"Let's analyze each option based on the provided passage:

*   **A: Lawn rysh al7ywan (The color of the animal's feathers):** The passage explicitly states that scientists determined the dinosaur's feather color based on the discovery: ""Yaqulu al-3ulama2 inna lawn rish hadha al-7ayawam bunni kastana2iy min al-a3la ma3 janib sufli sha7ib aw karutini."" So, this *is* a result of the discovery.

*   **B: Fhm an alrysh lm ystkhdm fi altyran (Understanding that feathers were not used for flight):** The passage mentions that the structure of the feathers indicates they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display: ""Yushiru haykal al-rish ila annahu lam yatim isti5damuhu athna2a at-tayaran bal li tanzim darajat al-7arara aw 3ardiha."" This *is* a result of the discovery.

*   **C: Nzrh 3la ttwr alrysh (Insight into the evolution of feathers):** The passage states that the discovery provides insight into the evolution of feathers: ""Yamna7u al-iktishaf aydan nazratan thaqibatan li-tatawur al-rish lida al-tuyur."" It then explains how the lack of a developed rachis suggests a gradual evolution of that feature. Thus, this *is* a result of the discovery.

*   **D: Takyd an m3ezm aldynaswrat ldyha rysh (Confirmation that most dinosaurs had feathers):** The passage says: ""Wa hadha la yu2akked fakat anna 3ala al-aqal ba3ed al-daynasurat ladayha rish, wa hadhihi nazariyya muntashira sabiqan"". This is the key. The discovery confirms that at least *some* dinosaurs had feathers, something already a widespread theory. It does *not* confirm that *most* dinosaurs had feathers.

Therefore, the answer is **D**."

This translates to: ""Given that the dinosaur feathers did not contain a developed vertebral column, called 'rachis', but it had other features - the root and the barbs...""

Therefore, the dinosaur feathers *did not* possess a **rachis**.

Let's examine why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: alqsybat alsghra (Small barbs):** The passage mentions ""al 2aslat wal-2asila (the root and the barbs),"" indicating that barbs *were* present.

*   **C: rysh balgh (Adult feathers):** The passage states, ""illa anna al-2ayinat tuzhir rishan balighan wa laysa rish for5 saghir (the specimen shows adult feathers and not the feathers of a small chick)."" This indicates that the feathers *were* adult feathers.

*   **D: janb sfly shahb allwn (Pale-colored underside):** The passage mentions, ""lawn rish hadha al-7ayawam bunni kastana2iy min al-a3la ma3 janib sufli sha7ib aw karutini (the color of this animal's feathers is chestnut brown from the top with a pale or carotenoid underside)."" This indicates the presence of a pale-colored underside.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: mhwr alnwrh (rachis).**"

*   The passage states ""hatta l2an, lam yatem ithbat ay 3aqarir munasiba li 3ilaj al-3adwah al-mawjoudah (until now, no suitable drugs have been proven to treat the existing infection)."" This directly contradicts option B.

Let's confirm why the other options are correct:

*   **A: hw msnw3 mn ajsam mdadh (It is made of antibodies):** The passage mentions that ZMapp is ""koktel al-ajsam al-mudhadda (cocktail of antibodies).""
*   **C: kan bmthabh m3eyar mraqbh fi tjrbh PALM (It served as a control standard in the PALM experiment):** The passage clearly states ""Fi tajribat PALM , kana ZMapp bimathabat 3unsur ta7akum (In the PALM experiment, ZMapp served as a control element).""

*   This directly translates to: ""In the PALM trial, ZMapp was a control element, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline and compared it to the other three treatments.""
*   This confirms that ZMapp was used as a control and was compared against other treatments.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   A: The passage suggests ZMapp was less effective than hoped, not more.
*   C: While ZMapp was a baseline, the word kasas ""basis"", is less correct than m3yar mraqbh ""control standard.""
*   D: The passage explicitly states that no suitable treatment for existing infections has been proven."

Let's eliminate the other options:

*   B: tab3eat nfathh llhbr qyasyh (Standard Inkjet Printers) While an inkjet printer is used, this doesn't fully describe the method. The key aspect is the printable chip.
*   D: adwat altshkhys alakhra (Other diagnostic tools): This is too vague and doesn't relate to the information given.

Here's why:

* **A: mn almhtml an tkwn alahdath alty shklthm qd 7dtht mu2ekhraan (It is possible that the events that formed them occurred recently):** The passage states that they have been exposed to minimal weathering, suggesting recent formation.
* **B: wjwdhm y3ny an alqmr la yftqr ela alnshat aljywlwjy (Their existence means that the moon does not lack geological activity):**  The passage directly contradicts the claim that the moon is geologically dead because of these scarps.

* **D: lm yu3ethr 3la alkthyr mnha 3la sth alqmr (Not much of it was found on the surface of the moon):**  The passage says the scarps have been found *all over* the moon's surface (""fi kul an7a2 sati7 al-qamar""), meaning *many* of them were found, not few. This is the statement that is incorrect according to the provided paragraph."

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the ""lobate scarps"" show minimal weathering, indicating recent geological activity. This contradicts the claim that the moon is geologically dead. Option D directly reflects this idea of recent formation.
*   Option A is correct that the moon is shrinking slowly, this helps inform the idea that the landforms were created by this process.
*   Options B and C contradict the passage.

Therefore, option D is the best answer because it directly relates to the recent geological activity implied by the lobate scarps."

The passage states that ""addat al-dhuruf al-jawwiya al-qasiya ila i3aqat juhud al-inkadh"" which translates to ""the harsh weather conditions added to hindering the rescue efforts"".

So the question ""Besides the ice, what else affects the rescue efforts?"" is answered by the harsh weather conditions.

This translates to: ""Roberts firmly refused to say when he believes life begins, a question of great importance when considering the ethics of abortion, saying that it would be unethical to comment on the *details of potential cases/hypothetical scenarios*.""

Therefore, Roberts considered it unethical to comment on the **details of potential cases/hypothetical scenarios** related to when life begins.

This translates to: ""Infrared images show that temperature variations from day to night are similar to those in caves. They are cooler than the surrounding surfaces during the day and warmer at night."" This temperature behavior, especially the fact that the ""Seven Sisters"" are cooler during the day and warmer at night *like* caves, strongly suggests they might be a cave system.
*   The other options are less direct. The diameter of the cave entrance (B) might be relevant, but it's not as strong a piece of evidence on its own. The geological survey (C) is what's *providing* the information, not the information itself. The presence of the caves on the earth (D) provides no useful information for determining if The Seven Sisters is a cave or not."

    *   ""The suspect in the bombing was arrested after sustaining injuries due to the explosion.""
    *   ""His name is still unknown to the authorities, but they know he belongs to the Uighur ethnic group.""

*   **Q (The Question):** ""According to the passage, which statement about the suspect is NOT true?""

*   **Answer Choices:**
    *   **A: astkhdm syarh athna2 alhjwm** - ""He used a car during the attack."" The passage states a three-wheeled vehicle, not specifically a car. While three-wheeled vehicles can be *considered* a type of car, it is NOT entirely accurate to say that ""a car"" was used.
    *   **B: zu3em anh fjr 2ebwh nasfh** - ""It is alleged he detonated an explosive device."" This is aligned with the claim that his car was armed with explosives and that he rammed a crowd.
    *   **C: alsltat 3la drayh b3erqh** - ""The authorities are aware of his ethnicity."" The passage says they know he belongs to the Uighur ethnic group.
    *   **D: lm ysb bi2za** - ""He was not injured."" The passage says he sustained injuries in the explosion.

Given these translations:

The false statement is **D: lm ysb bi2za** (""He was not injured"") because the passage clearly states that he *was* injured.

The answer with the next best fit would be A because the vehicle used in the attack wasn't specifically named a ""car.""
"

The passage states: ""...illa annahum ya3rifun annahu yantami ila majmu3at al-Uighur al-3irqiyya."" which translates to ""...except that they know that he belongs to the Uighur ethnic group."" This confirms the authorities know the suspect's ethnicity.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: hwyat jmy3 almsharkyn (the identities of all participants)**: The passage only mentions one suspect.
*   **C: aldaf3 wra2 alhjwm (the motive behind the attack)**: The passage does not mention the motive.
*   **D: alasm alawl wa alakhir llmshtbh bh (the first and last name of the suspect)**: The passage states: ""La yazalu ismuhu majhulan bil nisba lil sulutat"" which translates to ""His name is still unknown to the authorities""."

ay mma yly wajht alm7th alfda2eyh mshklh fyh athna2 almhmh?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: al7ifaz 3la bwslh khrbyh (Maintaining an electrical compass)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions ""fu8dan al-jyrwskwb musba8an fy muhimati al-ma7a6ati al-fa'9a2ya"" which translates to ""loss of gyroscope in the space station mission"". A gyroscope is a device used for maintaining orientation and angular velocity (essentially, a compass for space). Losing it would mean facing problems with electrical compass or direction."
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma hw alhdf mn mhmh alma7ta alfda2eyh?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: ekmal syr fi alfda2 (Complete a spacewalk)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""7afa'6at al-ma7a6atu 3ala 2uslub 3amaliha ... 7ata 2intiha2 jawlati al-sayr fy al-fa'9a2"" - which translates to ""The station maintained its mode of operation ... until the end of the spacewalk."" This implies that completing the spacewalk was a goal of the mission.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: al3uthwr 3la bwslh khrbyh mfqwdh (Finding a missing magnetic compass):** The passage does not mention searching for a missing compass. It mentions a gyroscope malfunction, but that is not the same.
*   **B: alaqtrab mn daf3eat alt3edyl (Approaching attitude control thrusters):** While Chiao and Sharipov kept a safe distance from the thrusters, the passage does not imply that approaching them was the mission's objective.
*   **D: tnshyt alnfathat (Activating the jets):** Activating the jets was a solution implemented by ground control after a problem arose, not the initial objective of the mission."

The passage states that this is the first time this law (related to spam) has been used leading to an *edana* (إدانة - conviction). It does not state that a conviction *has* occurred. It just says it's the first time the law is being used that *could* result in a conviction. The rest of the statements are supported by the text:

*   **A:** The lawsuit was filed in Virginia because AOL, a leading internet service provider, is based there.
*   **C:** The law relating to spam was used in the case.
*   **D:** Accusations were directed at AOL.

Therefore, the answer is **B**.
"
ayun mn aljml altalyh tsf alqdyh bdqh?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is:

**A: tm atham AOL baltwzy'e ghyr almrghwb fyh** (AOL was accused of unwanted distribution)

Here's why:

*   The text states that the plaintiff raised the lawsuit in Virginia because AOL, a leading internet service provider, is headquartered there, and it is considered the company that instigated the charges (i.e., unwanted distribution).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: tdmnt alqdyh athnyn mn mzwdy khdmh alentrnt alra'edyn** (The case involved two leading internet service providers) The text only mentions AOL as a leading provider, not two.
*   **C: tm rf3 d3wa alqdyh fi 3am 2003** (The lawsuit was filed in 2003) The text specifies that a law was enacted in 2003, but the case itself was filed later, utilizing this law.
*   **D: rf3et AOL d3wa alqdyh** (AOL filed the lawsuit) The text states that the plaintiff raised the lawsuit against AOL, not the other way around."

"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma aldy sbbh alzlzal?","The correct answer is **D: 6.5 drjh 3la almqyas (6.5 degrees on the scale)**.

The passage states that a tsunami warning was not issued because the earthquake ""lam yastawfi mutatalibat quwatihi al-baligha 6.5"" - meaning the earthquake did not meet the required strength of 6.5 on the scale.

Question asks: Which of these preserves the activity of the sun and all other stars?

Therefore, the answer is **C: rotation and luminosity.**

The luminosity and rotation are the driving forces. The Rossby number is a consequence of those forces, and magnetic reversals are a result of that activity.

*   The passage states her stolen items (phone and laptop) were recovered.

The passage does **NOT** mention that she was murdered. Therefore, that's the event that did *not* happen according to the paragraph.

The passage states that Dr. Ur is skeptical about the *relevance* of the results to people with type 1 diabetes (""hadhihi annata2ij laysa laha silaton bil ashkhas al-musabin bi marad as-soukari min an-naw3i al-awwal""). The passage also says he is skeptical about the possibility of a *cure* for diabetes. Therefore, B is also a valid answer because he is doubtful about the cure. However, he does not express doubts about other experts or the health status of the mice if they are not diabetic, meaning C and D can be ruled out.

However, option A is more specific to what the passage says, and is therefore a slightly better fit.

In summary: both A and B are valid answers, A being slightly more valid because it uses a phrase found directly in the passage.

The other options are accurate based on the text:

*   A: lm ttmkn alta'erh fi alasl mn alhbwt bsbb altqs (The plane was originally unable to land due to the weather) - The passage mentions poor weather conditions hindered the search and contributed to the failed landing attempt.
*   B: thtmt alta'erh fi mkan b'eyd jdaan (The plane crashed in a very remote location) - The passage states the crash site was difficult to access, requiring police to be dropped into the jungle.

*   Franciszek Kowal is identified as one of the survivors, so he would be part of the group who escaped through the window after it was broken.

"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ay mma yly hw alhdf al3am llhkwmh?","The correct answer is **D: altkhfyf mn aktzaz al3arbat (Reducing vehicle congestion)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states ""...1300 3araba yatimmu shira2uha li takhfif al-izdi7am"" (1300 vehicles will be purchased to reduce congestion). This directly identifies the goal of reducing congestion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: tmwyl almzyd mn al'erbat bhlwl mars mn hda al3am (Funding more vehicles by March of this year):** While funding is involved, the core goal isn't *just* funding, but what that funding achieves. Also, while the initial commitment was in March, the passage doesn't specify the vehicles need to be funded by a certain date.
*   **B: shira2 300 3arbeh ejmalyh (Purchasing a total of 300 vehicles):** The passage mentions 300 additional vehicles, but the total number being purchased is 1300.
*   **C: shira2 1300 3arbeh edafyh (Purchasing 1300 additional vehicles):** The passage mentions that the total number of vehicles bought will be 1300, and this number includes the 300 additional ones. 1300 is not the additional amount.
"
mada a'elnt alhkwmh?,"Let's analyze the original text and the options:

* **Original Text (with translation):**  ""P: There was an announcement today to extend the government's commitment that it pledged in March/April of this year to fund fire trucks. 300 additional vehicles so that the total number rises to 1300 vehicles being purchased to alleviate congestion.""

* **Q: mada a'elnt alhkwmh? (What did the government announce?)**

Now let's look at the options:

* **A: enha tkhtt ltmwyl 300 3arbeh edafyh (It plans to fund 300 additional vehicles):** This is a correct part of the announcement. The government is funding 300 *additional* fire trucks.
* **B: enha mltzmh btkhfyf mshklh alnql (It is committed to alleviating the transportation problem/congestion):** This is also correct. The purpose of buying the trucks is to alleviate congestion.
* **C: enha tkhtt ltmwyl 1300 3arbeh edafyh (It plans to fund 1300 additional vehicles):** This is incorrect. It is funding a *total* of 1300 vehicles, but only 300 *additional* ones.
* **D: sytm hl mshklh alaktzaz bhlwl mars (The congestion problem will be solved by March):** The text does not mention a timeline for solving the congestion problem.

Therefore, both A and B are correct. However, option B, ""*It is committed to alleviating the transportation problem/congestion*"", is a broader statement encompassing the overall goal of the funding. Option A just mentions a part of the details but it's not as general as option B.

**Conclusion**

While both A and B contain truths from the passage, **B** is the best and most comprehensive answer to the question ""What did the government announce?""
"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma hy alm3lwmat alm3rwfh?","The correct answer is **A: tm tkhfyd mstwa althdyd (The threat level has been lowered)**.

Let's break down the Arabic:

*   **Wa adafat:""""Wa ma3a dhalik, fa inna khafid mustawa al-tahdid ila khatir la ya3ni anna al-tahdid al-shamel qad zala tamaman"""".""** This translates to: ""And she added: """"However, lowering the threat level to serious does not mean that the overall threat has completely disappeared.""""

Therefore:

*   There is no imminent attack predicted.
*   The overall threat hasn't completely disappeared, but the level is lowered to ""serious"".

Option A is the only one accurately reflected in the provided text."

Here's why:

*   The text clearly states that the presidential committee was formed ""ka rad min Martelly 3ala al-e7tijajat"" which translates to ""as a response from Martelly to the protests.""
*   Therefore, the committee was a reaction or answer to the protests, not an agreement with them.

The other options are all supported by the text:

*   **B: athart alantkhabat almtakhrh alahtjajat (Late elections triggered the protests)** This is true, as the text mentions the protests erupted ""bisabab al-ekhfaq fi 3aqd entikhabat"" (""because of the failure to hold elections"").
*   **C: wtalbt alahtjajat bastqalh almjls alantkhaby alm3qt alsabq (The protests called for the resignation of the previous interim electoral council.)** This is implied. The text mentions that one of the presidential commission's recommendations was the resignation of the previous council, which suggests this was a demand arising from the protests.
*   **D: kant alahtjajat 3nyfh fi b3d alahyan (The protests were sometimes violent)** The text says, ""al-e7tijajat al-lati kanat 3anifa a7yanan"" meaning ""the protests that were sometimes violent."""

"wfqaan llbyan, ma aldy la yd'emh aljmbaz alamryky b3d esa'h nsar llryadyyn?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: shb altrakhys (withdrawing licensing)**.

This translates to: ""...we agree with the statement of the USOC that the interests of athletes, clubs, and their sport can be better supported by moving forward towards meaningful change within the organization, **instead of withdrawing certifications/licenses**.""

Therefore, the US Gymnastics Federation does *not* support withdrawing licenses/certifications. The other options (creating a strong environment, necessary changes within the organization, and an independent investigation) are all supported within the text.

This translates to ""The US Gymnastics Federation and the USOC share the same goal, which is to make gymnastics and all sports as safe as possible to enable athletes to pursue their dreams in a positive and safe environment.""

The other options are incorrect:

*   A: tslyt aldw' 3la esa'h lary nsar (تسليط الضوء على إساءة لاري نصار) - ""Shining light on Larry Nassar's abuse"" is a part of the process and a goal of the independent investigation, but not the main overarching goal they both share moving forward.
*   B: atba'e shb altrakhys (إتباع شهب التراخيص) - ""Following the meteor of licenses"" is not mentioned at all in the passage and seems like a nonsensical translation. The passage actually mentions *avoiding* withdrawing certificates (licenses).
*   C: etlaq thqyq khas (إطلاق تحقيق خاص) - ""Launching a special investigation"" is a *means* to achieve the primary goal, but not the primary goal itself.

*   **C: enha sfynh kshfen 3n alalgham (It is a mine-detecting ship)** - This is stated in the paragraph: ""safina mudada lil algham min tiraz Avenger"" (a mine countermeasures ship of the Avenger class).

The paragraph says the ship was *going to* Puerto Princesa in Palawan, but it doesn't say that Palawan is its headquarters. Instead, it says the Seventh Fleet's headquarters are in Sasebo, Nagasaki, Japan."

The text states that Donald Trump made the announcement ""fi bayan alqah 3abra al-sikritir al-sa7afi"" meaning ""in a statement delivered through the press secretary"". So, the press secretary delivered the statement, even though it was on behalf of Trump.
"
"bhsb albyan, ay dwlh tthml ms'ewlyh hrash almqatlyn alasra?","The correct answer is **D: Turkia**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the US forces will leave Syria.
* The passage states that Turkey will be responsible for guarding the ISIS fighters.

Therefore, according to the statement, Turkey will assume the responsibility.

*   The passage states: ""illa anna ya2malu al-mas2ulun an yakuna dhalika kafiyan li isti3adat al-7awajiz arramliyya al-muta2akila fi itijah majra annahir."" This translates to ""officials hope that this will be enough to restore the eroded sand barriers upstream.""
*   ""7awajiz arramliyya"" are ""sand barriers"" or ""sandbars.""
*   The question ""mada yaml alms2wlwn an yhsl ntyjh alfydan?"" translates to ""What do officials hope will happen as a result of the flood?""
* The text explicitly states they hope for the restoration of sandbars, making A the most accurate answer.

While options B, C, and D are related to the overall health of the ecosystem that is affected by the sandbars, they are not the specific and directly mentioned hope of the officials related to the flood."

This, in turn, impacted sandbars and wildlife habitats. However, the question asks for the most direct effect of the dam's construction.

*   **A: qdban alrmal (sandbars)** - Sandbars are affected by the lack of sediment deposition.
*   **B: alshwb alahdb (the humpback chub)** - The humpback chub is facing extinction due to the changes caused by the dam.
*   **C: mwa'el alhyah albryh (wildlife habitats)** - Wildlife habitats are affected by the lack of sediment and the subsequent impact on sandbars.
*   **D: antshar alrwasb (the spread of sediment)** - The passage states that the dam *stopped* the spread of sediment.

Therefore, the most direct and permanent impact of the dam's construction, as stated in the text, is the stoppage of sediment deposition.

**So the correct answer is D: antshar alrwasb (the spread of sediment)**

*   A ""Somali extremist group"" is planning suicide attacks in Kenya and Ethiopia.
*   The US received information from an unknown source that suicide bombs will be detonated in ""prominent landmarks"" in both Ethiopia and Kenya.

The question asks which statement accurately describes the *threatened* extremist attacks.

*   **A:** Bombings in landmarks in one country. - Incorrect. The text mentions both Ethiopia and Kenya.
*   **B:** Bombings in two countries. - Partially correct. It mentions two countries, but leaves out the detail of landmarks.
*   **C:** Bombings in landmarks in two countries. - Correct. This accurately describes the threat as bombings in *landmarks* in both *Ethiopia and Kenya*.
*   **D:** Bombings in one country - Incorrect.

Therefore, the answer is **C**.

*   It also mentions that Petros Mantouvalos is a member of parliament and a lawyer (mu7ami).
*   Makis Triantafylopoulos is described as a journalist hosting a famous news show (""Zoungla"").

Therefore, Makis Triantafylopoulos is the only one who is NOT a lawyer."

*   **C: alshafywn (Notaries)** - The text specifically mentions *katibu al-3adel* (writers of justice), which can be interpreted as Notaries, and they were involved in illegal procedures.
*   **D: almhamwn (Lawyers)** - SakisKecgagioglou and Jorj Nikolakopoulos, who are famous lawyers, were jailed. Furthermore, Petros Mantouvalos, a member of parliament and a lawyer, had to resign due to his office members' involvement in illegal activities.

*   **Wales' dishonesty from the beginning (""Inna [Wales] kana kadhiban ma3ana mudhu al-bidaya""):** This indicates dishonesty.
*   **Wales' initial claim of legal reasons for deletion (""Fa qad tasarafa awalan kama law kana dhalika li asbab qanuniya""):** This refers to the false claim about legal reasons.
*   **Wales' pretense of listening and then artistic deletion (""Thumma tadhahra bi-annahu yastami3 ilayna, wusulan ila 7adfhihi al-fanni""):** This covers both the pretense of listening and the artistic deletion.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: syash almwq'e aljdydh fyma yt'elq balmhtwa aljnsy (New site policy regarding sexual content):** The passage mentions that community's annoyance with the matter led to efforts to formulate such a policy. So the new policy is a result of the frustration, not a cause for it.
*   **B: 7zf fn Wales (Wales' artistic deletion):** The quote states that Wales pretended to listen and then proceeded with an ""artistic deletion"". This caused frustration.
*   **C: edm esgha' Wales lh (Wales' lack of listening):** The quote mentions that Wales pretended to listen, which means that he didn't actually listen to them. This caused frustration.
*   **D: akadyb 7wl sbb hdf alfn (Lies about the reason for the artistic deletion):** The quote states that Wales initially acted as if the deletion was for legal reasons, implying lies.

Therefore, based on the passage, *the only option that doesn't cause for Adam Cuerden's frustration* is the **new site policy regarding sexual content (A)**.

**Final Answer: A**"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma aldy tm hdfh mn almwq'e?","Let's break down the Arabic text to figure out what was deleted.

*   The text mentions ""Adam Cuerden's frustration about deletion operations.""
*   He says Wales ""had been lying to us since the beginning.""
*   He mentions Wales pretended to listen and then did a ""technical deletion"".
*   The community's displeasure led to efforts to formulate a policy regarding ""sexual content"" on the website.

Based on this, the correct answer is **B: mhtwa jnsy (sexual content)**. The passage explicitly states that the community's displeasure and subsequent policy efforts are related to sexual content.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""I believe women should not fight. This is my real opinion."" This directly contradicts supporting women fighters.
*   The passage indicates his support for the British competitors (B) and the London Olympics (D), and does not contain any information about his views on the opinions of women in general (C)."
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ay mma yly syd'emh Amir Khan 3la alrghm mn rayh alshkhsy?","The correct answer is **C: awlmbyad 2012**.

*   Option B directly addresses this fear of the unknown that the passage mentions.
*   The other options are incorrect because they are not related to the information provided in the text.

Therefore, the answer is B."

Here's why:

*   The paragraph explicitly states that after searching for prices and comparing them, it's beneficial to check the airline's website before booking. This aligns directly with option D.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: albhth fi 'erwd shrkat alsfr almt3ddh** (Searching for offers from multiple travel companies) - While this is *implied* in the search and comparison process, the specific instruction is to check the *airline's* website *after* that.
*   **B: alhjz mbashrh m3 shrkh altyran** (Booking directly with the airline) - The paragraph doesn't directly say to *always* book directly. It says to check the airline website *before* booking, suggesting a comparison step *before* deciding where to book.
*   **C: mqarnh alas'ear byn shrkat alsfr almt3ddh** (Comparing prices between multiple travel companies) - Again, this is an *implied* step, but the paragraph focuses on the *final* check: the airline's website.

Therefore, option D is the most direct and accurate answer based on the provided paragraph."

Here's why:

* The passage states that it's rare to book directly with airlines *before* searching for and comparing prices.  This implies that the price comparison is the first step.
* While checking the airline's website (A) is mentioned as *beneficial*, it's suggested *after* using search engines.

Therefore, B is the most accurate answer to what the passage suggests travelers should do *first* to secure the best possible flight prices.

*   The text states that the only way to get things faster was to send them as opened baggage (""kana assabil al wa7id lil 7usul 3alayha bishaklin asra3 huwa ersaluha ka amti3aten tamma fat7uha""). This implies that the presence of someone accompanying the shipment (effectively being a passenger with baggage) is necessary when sending things this way.
*   Option A is incorrect because the passage states that shipping takes too long.
*   Options B and D are not relevant because they don't deal with the requirement for a companion to the package."
"bna'an 3la alfa8arh, 3nd akhtyar shrkh alkhtwt aljwyh almntzmh fi thalf, ay mma yly yjb an t'etyh alawlwyh?","The correct answer is **A: shrkh altyran alty tqadam akbr 3dd mn alnqat (شركة الطيران التي تقدم أكبر عدد من النقاط - The airline that offers the largest number of points).**

Here's why:

* **The paragraph emphasizes that frequent flyer points can vary significantly within the same alliance.**  It states, ""niqat al musafir adda2im qad takunu akthar skha2an fi dhil sharikat tayaran mukhtalifa fi nafs atta7aluf (نقاط المسافر الدائم قد تكون أكثر سخاءً في ظل شركة طيران مختلفة في نفس التحالف - Frequent flyer points may be more generous under a different airline within the same alliance)."" This directly supports prioritizing the airline within the alliance that offers the best points accumulation.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: shrkh altyran fi akbr thalf (شركة الطيران في أكبر تحالف - The airline in the largest alliance):** The size of the alliance isn't the key factor; the value of the points offered *within* that alliance is what matters.
* **C: shrkh altyran alty tsafr m3ha ghalbaan (شركة الطيران التي تسافر معها غالبًا - The airline you travel with most often):** While convenience is a factor, the paragraph explicitly says you shouldn't *just* choose the airline you fly most often without considering the points system.
* **D: shrkh altyran alty qd tdyf amtyazat edafyh (شركة الطيران التي قد تضيف امتيازات إضافية - The airline that may add extra privileges):** While extra privileges are nice, the core advice of the paragraph focuses on maximizing the value of frequent flyer points.

Therefore, the primary focus, according to the paragraph, should be on maximizing the number of points earned within the alliance.

The passage explicitly states that ""Ishrab al-mashrubat al-ku7uliya bi-i3tidal"" which translates to ""Drink alcoholic beverages in moderation."" This directly implies that moderation can lessen the harmful effects of alcohol. The rest of the options talk about things which will make the harm caused by alcohol worse.

The question asks ""Where are the real estate values among the highest in Amsterdam?""

Let's analyze the other options:

*   **A: myzanyh sfr dkhmh (Large travel budget)** The text says it's ""muklifa"" (expensive), but a large budget would enable, not prevent, travel.
*   **B: alahtmam alwhyd fi astkshaf bhr Ross (Sole interest in exploring the Ross Sea)** The passage specifically mentions that visits are largely restricted to the peninsula, islands, and the Ross Sea. This would be a valid interest, not a hindrance.
*   **C: jdwl 'eml ysmh balsfr fi dysmbr wynayr (Work schedule allowing travel in December and January)** The passage states that visits are only possible in the summer months from November to February (Tishrin aththani 7atta Shubat), which aligns with December and January. This would facilitate, not prevent, travel."

*   Tamaki Drive beaches (Mission Bay and St Heliers) are described as family-oriented and sometimes crowded. This implies they might not be the ""best"" choice if you're looking for a more relaxed or less crowded beach day.

*   While Tamaki Drive beaches are also described as having safe swimming, they are characterized as ""3a2iliya muzda7ima fi ba3dh al-a7yan"" (family-friendly, crowded at times) which can be less appealing to some people.

*   **B: ghyr tby'eyh (Unnatural):** Opposite of ""tabi3iyya"".
*   **C: mbnyh (Built/Constructed):** Again, refers to artificial languages.
*   **D: mktsbh (Acquired):** This is the closest to the actual meaning, as languages of common communication are typically learned or acquired naturally by speakers.

Therefore, the best answer choice is **D: mktsbh**."
ay jmlh la tsf bdqh allghat almsa'edh?,"The correct answer is **D: tnsha klghat mhymnh byn almt7dthyn blghat mkhtlfh**. Here's why:

*   The original passage (P) specifically states that an auxiliary language (al-lughat al-musa3ida) is *distinct* from a common language (al-lugha al-mushtaraka), which becomes dominant due to historical or other reasons.
*   Option D describes a characteristic of a dominant language (al-lugha al-mushtaraka), not an auxiliary language. Therefore, it does not accurately describe an auxiliary language.
*   Options A, B, and C all contain elements of the original passage's description of auxiliary languages (artificial, built for communication facilitation in difficult situations).

So, option D is the best answer because it presents an idea that is directly contradictory to the definition of an auxiliary language provided in the passage."
"wfqaan llfa8arh, mn mada yjb 3la alrkab althqq eda kant rhlthm albhryh fi alshta'?","The correct answer is **A: mwq'e alkabynh (location of the cabin)**

The passage states: ""When crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as passage through ice causes terrible noise for the most affected people."" This clearly indicates that passengers on cruises in the winter Baltic Sea should be aware of their cabin location due to ice noise.
"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, eda kant rhlh alrkab albhryh fi alsyf, fmada ymknhm tjnbh?","The correct answer is **B: almrwr 'ebr aljlyd (The passage through ice)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that you should check the cabin's location when crossing the Baltic Sea *in winter* because passing through ice causes terrible noise. The question asks what passengers can avoid if their cruise is *in summer*. Summer in the Baltic Sea means no ice."
lmada tstkhdm alkatalwnyh bshkl mtkrr llesharat wale3lanat fi brshlwnh?,"The correct answer is **B: kant awl lghh rsmyh fi almdynh** (It was the first official language in the city).

The passage states: ""Wa tatimu al ishara ila mu3dham al 3alamat bil lugha al Kataluniyya faqat li 2annaha mu7adada bi mawjib alqanun ka lugha rasmiyya 2ula"" (Most signs are only in Catalan because it is designated by law as the first official language).
"
ayun mn allghat altalyh hy alty ystkhdmha nzam mtrw brshlwnh lle3lanat almntzmh?,"The correct answer is **B: Katalan**

The passage states: ""Yajri al e3lan 3n al e3lanat al munthadhima fi al Metro bil lugha al Kataluniyya faqat"" which translates to ""Regular announcements in the Metro are made in Catalan only.""
"
"bna'an 3la alfa8arh, ay mn wsa'el alrahh altalyh mn ghyr almhtml an ytm e'eta'eha alawlwyh fi mbyt weftar raqy?","The answer is **D: WiFi sre3**.

Here's why:

*   The paragraph focuses on luxury and unique experiences: handcrafted items, historical settings, regional foods, and antiques.
*   Options A, B, and C align with this focus. A specialized menu aligns with the focus on regional/unique cuisine. Antique furnishings and well-maintained outdoor spaces also enhance the luxurious and unique atmosphere.
*   While Wi-Fi is important for convenience, it's not typically considered a defining feature of a luxurious and unique bed and breakfast experience like the ones described. The focus is much more on the tangible and artistic aspects of the lodging and food."
"bna'an 3la alfa8arh, ay mma yly lys ahd nqat almnafsh alr'eysyh byn mnshat almbyt waleftar alfakhrh?","Let's break down the Arabic text and analyze the options.

*   **P (Passage Summary):** The passage discusses luxury lodging and breakfast establishments. Competition in this sector primarily revolves around two things: the quality of the bedding and the breakfast offerings. The best establishments feature luxurious beds (hand-made quilts, antique beds), breakfasts that include regional seasonal food or the host country's special dishes, and historic locations (antique furniture, gardens, swimming pools).

Now let's analyze the provided options:

*   **A: الديكور المعاصر (Contemporary Decor):** This translates to ""contemporary decor."" The passage mentions ""antique furniture"" and ""historic building,"" which is the opposite of contemporary.
*   **B: مجموعة من عروض الإفطار الموسمية (A selection of seasonal breakfast offerings):** This translates to ""a range of seasonal breakfast offers."" The passage discusses seasonal breakfast being a key aspect of such establishment, it is mentioned ""al-ma2kulat al-mawsimiya lil mintaqa (the regional seasonal food) in context of describing Iftar (breakfast)"".
*   **C: فراش راقي (Upscale Mattress/Luxurious bedding):** This translates to ""high-end mattress."" The passage explictly states that bedding is one of the main competition, ""afkham anwa3 al-afrisha (most luxurious types of bedding)"".
*   **D: الطعام والشراب من مصادر محلية (Locally sourced food and drink):** This translates to ""food and drink from local sources"". The passage states, that the best establishments have breakfasts that include regional seasonal food and the host country's special dishes.

**Based on the passage, option A, الديكور المعاصر (Contemporary Decor), is NOT a point of competition.** The text focuses on historic and antique elements.

**Therefore, the answer is A.**"
"wfqana llfa8arh, ay mma yly ln yhsl fi bkyn 3am 2022?","The correct answer is **B: mntqh tayzytshngh lltzlj (Taizicheng skiing area)**.

Here's why:

*   The paragraph states that the Taizicheng skiing area is in Zhangjiakou, which is about 220 kilometers from Beijing. Therefore, skiing activities in Taizicheng won't happen in Beijing.
*   The paragraph explicitly mentions that Beijing will host the opening ceremony, closing ceremony, and indoor ice events."
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ay mma yly ststdyfh bkyn fi 3am 2022?","Based on the paragraph provided, the correct answer is **D: mrasm alakhttam** (Closing ceremony).

The paragraph states: ""Satastadhif Beijing 7aflatay al-iftita7 wal khitam wa tadhahurat al-jalid addakhiliya."" This translates to ""Beijing will host both the opening and closing ceremonies and indoor ice demonstrations.""

While Beijing is hosting the Winter Olympics (C), the question asks specifically what Beijing will *host*. The paragraph directly mentions hosting the opening and closing ceremonies and indoor ice demonstrations.
"
mn hw alakthr 'erdh llesabh benflwnza altywr?,"Based on the provided text (P), the most vulnerable to avian influenza are those who work in poultry farming.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: alashkhas aldyn ya3mlwn m3 aldwajn (The people who work with poultry)**
"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ay mn al'ebarat altalyh tsf bdqh enflwnza altywr?","The correct answer is **C: muraqbw altywr m3rdwn lkhtr alesabh** (Bird watchers are at risk of infection).

Here's why:

* **P states:**  ""...hunaka aydan ba3d al-ma5atir 3ala muraqibi a66uyur."" which translates to ""...there are also some risks to bird watchers.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: fqt 'emal aldwajn asybwa balenflwnza** (Only poultry workers are infected with influenza): The passage states that *most* cases involve poultry farmers, but it doesn't say *only* poultry farmers.
* **B: tm aleblagh 3n halat fi albshr akthr mn altywr** (More cases have been reported in humans than in birds): The passage states ""Less than a thousand cases have been reported among humans..."" This implies far fewer human cases than bird cases.
* **D: jmy'e alhalat almblgh 3nha fi albshr kant qatlh** (All cases reported in humans were fatal): The passage says ""Some of them were fatal,"" implying that not all human cases were fatal.
"
mada trbt qnah albhr alabyd - bhr albltyq?,"The correct answer is **C: Almhyt almtjmd alshmaly wbhr albltyq** (The Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea).

The passage explicitly states that the White Sea-Baltic Canal connects the Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea.
"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma nw'e al3arbeh alty ymkn jm3 jwazat alsfr fyha hta la ynqt'e nwm alrakb?","The correct answer is **B: qtarat alnwm allylh (قطارات النوم الليلية)**.

"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, mta ymkn fhs btaqh hwytk fi b3d alqtarat 'ebr alhdwd?","The correct answer is **D: fi alqtar alsa'er (في القطار السائر) - in the moving train.**

The passage explicitly states: ""Fi ba3dh al-qitarat al-3abira lil-7udud, tujra 3amaliyat attaftish fil qitar al-muta7arrik... (في بعض القطارات العابرة للحدود، تجرى عمليات التفتيش في القطار المتحرك...)"" which translates to ""In some trains that cross borders, inspection operations are carried out on the moving train...""

The text explicitly mentions dealing with constant heat (""حرارة - 7arara"") and strong sun (""شمس قوية - shames qawiyya"") in Singapore, which is a direct cause of heat exhaustion. The other options are not supported by the passage:

*   **A: التعرض للسرقة (alt'erd llsrqh) - Exposure to theft:** The passage states Singapore is generally safe.
*   **B: عدم إمكانية الوصول إلى المتاجر (edm emkanyh alwswl ela almtajr) - Inability to access stores:** The passage states you can buy almost anything after arriving.
*   **D: الضياع (aldya'e) - Getting lost:** The passage states Singapore is easy to navigate."
mn qd yrghb fi tjnb tnawl alm3jnat alalmanyh?,"The text mentions that many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Therefore, someone with a severe nut allergy would want to avoid eating German pastries.

So the answer is A.
"
ma hw almkwn aldy y'etbr 3nsraan mwsmyaan fi alm3jnat alalmanyh?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is:

**C: alkhwkh**

Here's why:

The text states: ""tu3tabar mu3ajjanat al-fakiha sha2i3a, 7aythu yatimmu tahy attufa7 fi al-mu3ajanat 3ala madar assana, wa yadhhar al-karaz wal khaukh khilal fasl assayf.""

*   **Attufa7 (Apples)** are used throughout the year.
*   **Al-karaz wal khaukh (Cherries and Peaches)** appear during the summer.
*   **Albndq (Hazelnuts) and Allwz (Almonds)** are mentioned as ingredients in many baked goods, but not specifically tied to a season like peaches.

Therefore, khaukh (peaches) are a seasonal component in German pastries, making C the best answer.
"
"bna'an 3la alfa8arh, ayun mn altaly ln ykwn nsyhh mwsa bha llsfr bmyzanyh mhdwdh?","The correct answer is **C: atlb almal mn alnas** (Ask for money from people).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the advice assumes travelers do not beg or exploit others for personal gain. Asking for money from people falls directly under the category of begging.
*   The other options align with the article's suggestions:
    *   **A:** The article mentions working while traveling as a way to afford travel, which is related to finding jobs.
    *   **B:** The article states that it is necessary to sacrifice time and comfort
    *   **D:** The passage talks about trying to reduce spending."
"wfqaan llfa8arh, mn qd ywajh s'ewbh fi alsfr bmyzanyh d'eylh jdaan?","Based on the provided paragraph, the answer is **B: shkhs bdwn qywd zmnyh sarmh (A person without strict time constraints)**

Here's why:

*   The paragraph states: ""Li 2ula2ika alladhyn yarghabun fi attadh7iya bi-rra7a wal waqt wal qudra 3ala attanabu2 li-khafdh annafaqat bil qurb min assifr, raji3 al-7ad al-2adna li-mizaniyat assafar.""
*   This translates to: ""For those who are willing to sacrifice comfort, time, and predictability to reduce expenses close to zero, consult the minimum travel budget.""

Therefore, the text indicates that individuals who are flexible with their time will be better suited to travel on a very low budget, since they are more able to withstand delays, and changes in plans.
"
ay mn altsryhat altalyh la tsf bdqh alqyadh byn Point Marion wa Fairmont?,"Based on the provided text, the statement that does *not* accurately describe driving between Point Marion and Fairmont is:

**C: nadraan ma ytm alaltzam bhdwd alsr3eh**

Here's why:

*   The text emphasizes the importance of adhering to the speed limit in this area (""yumathil al-iltizam bi hadhihi assur3at ahamiyat baligha akthar min ayi shay2 akhar""). This contradicts the statement that speed limits are rarely observed.

The other options are supported by the text:

*   **A: hnak msahat twylh mn altrq alryfyh alna'eyh** - ""tadharis ghabat ma3zula"" indicates isolated rural areas.
*   **B: almmrat dyqh** - ""al-mun7anayat adhayiqa"" means narrow curves.
*   **D: la ynbghy an tkwn khdmh alhatf almhmwl mshklh** - ""Mina al-gharib 2anna khidmat al-hatif al-ma7mul aqwa bi-kathir huna"" indicates strong cell service."

**C: Akhd mn'etf had bsr3eh kbyrh (Taking a sharp turn at a high speed)**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions ""al-mun7adarat al-7adda wal mamarrat wal mun7anayat adhayiqa"" (sharp slopes, passages, and narrow curves).
*   It also emphasizes the importance of adhering to the posted speed limits (which are lower than other sections of the highway) and states that complying with these speeds is of utmost importance.
*  The passage warns that the conditions on the road between Point Marion and Fairmont are challenging, highlighting the importance of focus due to the sharp slopes, passages, and narrow curves. If drivers are going too fast, especially around the tight curves, they are likely to experience an accident.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A:** The text does not mention heavy traffic on this stretch of road.
*   **B:** The text actually mentions that cell phone service is surprisingly strong in this area, the opposite of inadequate cell service.
*   **D:** The text doesn't highlight frequent roadwork as a concern on this particular segment of the highway."
ay mma yly ghyr mtlwb lbd' altjdyf?,"Based on the text provided, the answer is **B: halh bdnyh 'ealyh (High physical condition)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that canyoneering ""tatatallab al-qalil nisbiyan min attadrib aw ashakl al-badani lil-bad2"" which translates to ""requires relatively little training or physical shape to start.""  The other options (ability to swim, ability to jump, and a small amount of training) are implied to be necessary components of canyoneering, whereas high physical condition is not.
"
ay mma yly qd ykwn drwryaan lrhlh tjdyf najhh?,"Based on the information provided in P, canyoneering in Dahab:

*   **Requires relatively little advanced training or physical fitness to begin** compared to other sports like rock climbing, diving, or alpine skiing.
*   **Combines elements of swimming, climbing, and jumping.**

Therefore, the most essential requirement for a successful canyoneering trip from the given options is:

*   **D: qdrh alsbahh (Swimming ability)** since swimming is an integral part of the activity as stated in P.

The other options are not explicitly stated as essential in the description:

*   Advanced athletic ability (A) is not required to begin.
*   Previous diving experience (B) is not mentioned.
*   A canyoneering certification (C) is not mentioned

**Therefore, the answer is D.**"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma aldy sykwn mfydaan lshkhs ykhtt lltkhyym fi syarth?","The correct answer is **B: syarh tsmh llmqa'ed balastlqa' (a car that allows the seats to recline)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Yumkinu attakhyim fi assayara idha kana ladayk minivan kabir aw sayarat daf3 ruba3y aw sedan aw Station Wagon bi-maqa3id ta2khudh wadh3 al-istilqa2."" This directly translates to: ""Camping in the car is possible if you have a large minivan or four-wheel drive vehicle or sedan or Station Wagon with seats that recline.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: fhm qwy lqywd syartk (A strong understanding of your car's limitations):** While helpful for any road trip, the passage doesn't explicitly say this is *essential* for camping in the car. it is something you are more familiar with compared to a larger car.
*   **C: khymh (Tent):** The passage contrasts car camping with using a tent.
*   **D: mlkyh khash lltkhyym fyha (Private property to camp on):** The passage states that setting up a tent on private property or in a city can easily attract unwanted attention.
"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma aldy qd yrghb mkhym fi alsyarh fi tjnbh eda kan yttl'e ela tjnb lft alantbah?","Based on the provided paragraph, the correct answer is:

**C: Nasb khayma fi almdyna aw fi mlkyh khash (Erecting a tent in the city or on private property)**

The paragraph specifically states that pitching a tent on private property or in a city is likely to attract unwanted attention.  The camper inside the car would be trying to avoid this.
"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, mn a'ead bna' aldar albyda' llmrh althanyh?","The correct answer is **D: Sultan al-Maghrib**.

The passage states: ""A3ada assultan al-maghribi bina2 al-madina bi ism Daru l-Badya"" which translates to ""The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name Daru l-Badya.""
"
mn hjr mdynh aldar albyda' alhdythh b3d karthh tby'eyh?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: albrtghalywn** (the Portuguese).

"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, kyf hslt Sintra 3la ala'etraf byn alajanb?","The correct answer is **C: mraj'eat allwrd bayrwn aleyjabyh** (Lord Byron's positive reviews).

The text states that Sintra became famous among foreigners ""ba3da tasjil 7isab 3an madhiriha alkhallaba min qibal Lord Byron"" which translates to ""after a recording of its stunning appearances by Lord Byron"". This directly indicates that Lord Byron's account led to Sintra's fame among foreigners.
"

The passage states: ""Ella annahu la yujad dawla qa2ima wa la 7atta Arminya ta3tarifu biha rasmiyyan."" This directly translates to ""But there is no existing state and not even Armenia officially recognizes it.""  The ""it"" refers to the new republic established in Nagorno-Karabakh.
"
ma aldy la yzal y'ethr 3la al3laqat byn Azerbaijan wa Armenia?,"The correct answer is **D: eqlym Nagorno-Karabakh** (The Nagorno-Karabakh region).

The text explicitly states that the diplomatic dispute over the region continues to spoil relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The conflict and creation of a new republic stemmed from the dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh.
"
"athna' rkwb syarh ajrh fi Charlotte, ma aldy ymkn an y'edy ela rswm edafyh?","The correct answer is **B: wjwd thlathh rkab (having three passengers)**.

The passage explicitly states ""Hunaka taklifa idafiyya li wujud akthar min rakibayn"" which translates to ""There is an additional cost for having more than two passengers."" Therefore, having three passengers (thlathh rkab) will result in additional fees.
"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma aldy ymkn a'etbarh janbaan slbyaan ll'eysh fi sharlwt m3 alatfal?","The correct answer is **B: rkwb syarh ajrh (Riding in a taxi)**

Here's why:

The passage mentions that families in Charlotte don't typically use taxis because they can be expensive, especially with more than two passengers. This presents a potential downside for families living in Charlotte.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: as'ear alskn (Housing prices):** The paragraph doesn't talk about housing prices.
*   **C: almqymyn mn mnatq akhra (Residents from other areas):** The paragraph states that the reason for moving to Charlotte is because of the family atmosphere.
*   **D: mhawlh alastmta'e balmdynh (Trying to enjoy the city):** The passage says that visitors find the city fun with children."

*   **A: kan hnak ghyab llhkwmh almrkzyh (There was an absence of a central government):** The passage states that the Napoleonic Wars ""left Spain without a functional central government for two years,"" which was happening around 1810. So this *did* happen.
*   **B: hqqt tshyly alnsr 3la alesban (Chile achieved victory over the Spanish):** The passage clearly states that ""decisive victory over the Spanish was not achieved until 1818."" So this did NOT happen in 1810.
*   **C: kant alhrwb alnablywnyh jaryh (The Napoleonic Wars were ongoing):** The passage mentions the Napoleonic Wars directly, indicating they were happening in 1810. So this *did* happen.
*   **D: a'elnt tshyly astqlalha (Chile declared its independence):** The passage states ""Chile declared its independence in 1810."" So this *did* happen.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: hqqt tshyly alnsr 3la alesban**."

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""...hunak mu3iddat idafiyya mujahhaza li 7alat al inzilaq... (there are additional devices equipped for slippery conditions...)"" This directly refers to traction devices.
*   The passage does mention that the pattern should be deep enough (1/5 inch or more). So option D is wrong.
*   It also mentions the heel should be low and wide, which contradicts option A and C."
ayun mn altaly ln ysa'ed fi thsyn aljr 3la altrq aljlydyh athna' zrwf alshta'?,"The text says: ""Ghaliban ma yatanathar arraml aw al 7asa aw al mil7 (chloride alcalcium) 3ala alturuq aw almasarat li ta7sin al i7tikak.""

Therefore, salt, gravel, and sand *help* improve traction. The only option left is water.

So the answer is D: alma' (water).

"
ay mma yly la ysf bdqh jzr Cook?,"The correct answer is **C: almdyntan alr'eysytan huma Rarotonga wa Aitutaki** (The two main cities are Rarotonga and Aitutaki).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the Cook Islands ""La tadhumu juzur Cook ay mudun"" (The Cook Islands do not contain any cities). Rarotonga and Aitutaki are islands, not cities.
*   The other options are accurate based on the passage:
    *   A: ""enha asghr mn Hawaii"" (It is smaller than Hawaii) - The passage implies this by saying ""3ala arraghm min kawniha asghar 7ajman"" (Despite being smaller in size).
    *   B: ""enha arkhbyl"" (It is an archipelago) - The passage states ""Innahu arkhabil yadhum 15 jazira"" (It is an archipelago that includes 15 islands).
    *   D: ""tshark aldwlh aljzyrh almntqh alzmnyh m3 Hawaii"" (The island nation shares the time zone with Hawaii) - The passage says ""Li-tamayuziha bi-nnitaq azzamany nafsahu li-Hawaii"" (Due to its characteristic of the same time zone as Hawaii)."
ay mn mhtat alhras altalyh tqadam nw'eyn mn khyarat aleqamh?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

*   The text states: ""Tu3addu Sirena m7attat al7irasa al-wa7ida allaty tuqaddimu assakan fi salat nawm mushtaraka wa wajabat sakhina bil-2idhafa ila attakhyim."" This translates to ""Sirena is the only ranger station that offers accommodation in shared dormitories and hot meals in addition to camping."" Thus, Sirena provides two types of food options: hot meals (wajabat sakhina) and food you bring while camping (implied).

*   The other ranger stations (La Leona, San Pedrillo, and Los Patos) only offer camping without food services (""la tuqaddimu... siwa attakhyim bidun khidmat ta3am"")."
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ayn ymknk hjz tsryh hdyqh eda knt tryd astkhdam alnqwd bdlaan mn ala'etman?","The correct answer is **B: Puerto Jiménez**.

This indicates you can get the park permit and pay with cash in Puerto Jiménez.

"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma nw'e altzlj aldy ytm fi altdarys alakthr anhdaraan?","Based on the passage, the type of skiing that takes place in the steepest terrain and requires stiffer skis and boots is the one that is like mountaineering in the Alps. This corresponds to option C. So the answer is:

**C: altzlj 3la jbal alalb** (Skiing in the Alps Mountains)"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma aldy qd ysa'ed almtzljyn fi almnatq alryfyh aldyn yrghbwn fi alwswl ela sr'eat a3la?","Let's analyze the provided text to determine the correct answer.

The text states: ""Fi dhil adhuruf al-jayida, satakunu qadiran 3ala qat3 masafat kabira ila 7addin ma mina almashy - wa lakin nadharan ma satatamatta3 bi-sur3at attazalluj arrify bidun 7aqibat dhahr thaqila fi masarat mu3adda.""

This translates to: ""Under good conditions, you will be able to cover a large distance to some extent from walking - but also you will enjoy the speed of rural skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared tracks.""

The text mentions that you can enjoy higher speeds in rural skiing by *not* having a heavy backpack and on prepared tracks under good conditions.

Let's evaluate the options:

*   **A: a7dhiya akthar salaba (stiffer shoes)** - The text mentions stiffer shoes in the context of more challenging terrain, not for increasing speed in rural skiing.
*   **B: 7aqibat dhahr thaqila (heavy backpack)** - The text explicitly says to *avoid* a heavy backpack to increase speed.
*   **C: adhuruf al-jayida (good conditions)** - The text states that you can cover a larger distance and enjoy higher speeds *under good conditions*.
*   **D: masarat mu3adda (prepared tracks)** - The text mentions ""prepared tracks"" in the same sentence as the advantage of increased speeds

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is **C: adhuruf al-jayida (good conditions)**. While prepared tracks will help, the over arching factor that will help the skier reach a higher speed is good conditions.

Final Answer: **C**"

The passage clearly states that travelers experiencing reverse culture shock face difficulty in ""i3adat attakayuf ma3a thaqafatihim al-asliyya"" (re-adapting to their original culture). This directly corresponds to option D.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: *""A7yanan yuwajih al-musafirun al-ladhin ladayhim waqet sahil fil takayyuf ma3a attaqafa al-jadida, su3ubatan khassa fi i3adat attakayuf ma3a thaqafatihim al-asliyya.""*  This translates to: *""Sometimes travelers who have an easy time adjusting to the new culture face particular difficulty in readjusting to their original culture.""*

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: almsafrwn aldyn 'eanwa mn sdmh thqafyh sy'eh bshkl khas (The travelers who suffered from a bad cultural shock)** The passage doesn't indicate that they have a particularly difficult reverse culture shock.
*   **C: almsafrwn aldyn ma zalwa fi mrhlh shhr al'esl (The travelers who are still in the honeymoon phase)** The passage mentions that reverse culture shock has a smaller ""honeymoon"" phase.
*   **D: almsafrwn bsbr aql (Travelers with less patience)** Patience is mentioned to be required by others, not a characteristic of the travelers who suffer from reverse culture shock.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states: ""**tathakkar annahu laysat hunak 7ajatan lina8r 3ala al-mafaty7 bi8uwa kabyra lil7u9wl 3ala mustawa 9awt e'9afy min al-biyanw.**"" (Remember that there is no need to press hard on the keys to get an additional level of sound from the piano/accordion.) This directly contradicts option A.

The other options are supported by the text:

*   **B:** The passage mentions avoiding strange finger movements to minimize effort.
*   **C:** The passage advises keeping your hands relaxed while playing the correct musical degrees.
*   **D:** The passage suggests using the bellows with more pressure or speed for additional volume on the accordion.

"3nd al3zef 3la al akkordyon, ayun mema yely seysa3edek 3la zeyadh alswet?","The correct answer is **A: Mezyed men assur3a** (More speed).

* **The passage states:** ""Lil 7osol 3ala 7ajem 2edafi min 2alat al akkordyon, yumkenuka 2este5dam manfa5 ma3 mazed min al daghet aw assur3a.""  This translates to: ""To get extra volume from the accordion, you can use the bellows with more pressure or speed.""

The other options are incorrect based on the passage:

* **B: Mezyed men al8uwa** (More power) - The passage specifically says not to hit the keys with great force on the piano (which implies the same principle would apply to the accordion keys). The bellows, not the keys, control volume.
* **C: Deghet aqel** (Less pressure) - The passage mentions using more pressure on the bellows, not less.
* **D: 7arkt aseb3 aqel** (Less finger movement) - While efficient finger movement is important, it doesn't directly relate to volume. The passage focuses on bellows control for volume.

"wefqaan llfqrh, ay men almusheklat atalyh qd twajh almr2 3nd ta7wyel film ela tenseyq DVD?","The passage describes that when converting a film to DVD format, a common problem is ""overscan."" This means that the edges of the image are cut off.  The passage specifically mentions that if subtitles are located near the bottom of the screen, they may be partially cut off. Therefore, the best answer is:

**B: tarjamat shashah maqtow3a jez2eyan (Screen subtitles partially cut off)**

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: sura la tmla2 kamel alshashah (Image does not fill the entire screen):** The passage specifically says overscan makes the image *fill* the screen by cutting off the edges, the opposite of this option.

*   **C: sura tmla2 kamel alshashah (Image fills the entire screen):** This is the *result* of overscan, but not a problem that's *faced*. Overscan *causes* this, rather than it being an issue in itself. The problem is what's *lost* to make it fill the screen.

*   **D: 7awaf maqtow3a (Cut off edges):** This is also true and a symptom of overscan. However, the passage explicitly mentions the consequence of losing parts of the subtitles, making option B the most specific and therefore the best answer.

The text states: ""...muswadat maktuba bi khat alyad waq3aha ra2is al Congress John Hancock wa al amin al-3am."" Which translates to ""... a handwritten draft signed by the President of the Congress John Hancock and the Secretary-General."" While John Hancock's name is mentioned, the secretary General is Charles Thomson, making D the best answer.

The passage states: ""laqad wasalat nuskha ila London fi 10 Oghustus."" This translates to ""a copy reached London on August 10th."" While other locations are mentioned, London is explicitly stated as a destination, and the text implies it received a copy later than the others (George Washington in New York on July 9th, Independence Hall on July 8th)."

(Translation: ""When the low tide opened a gap along the Mystic River along the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly expanded the fence with a short stone wall to the north, ending at the water's edge on a small beach."")

The colony's inhabitants begin the migratory phase when the available food decreases. During this phase, the colony's inhabitants work to build temporary shelters that change daily. Each of these revolutions or marches lasts for approximately 17 days.""

Now let's analyze the answer options:

*   **A: y3asheshewn khelal alalyel (They nest during the night):** The text says they *march* at night, not nest. It states that during the day they stop building camps.
*   **B: ykwn ladyhem makhzwen qelyel men al ta3am (They have little food reserves):** The text explicitly states that the migratory phase begins when ""the available food decreases"".
*   **C: yeqwemwen b3mal a3eshash tetgheyr b3d 17 yawman (They build nests that change after 17 days):** The text says they build temporary shelters that change *daily*, not after 17 days.
*   **D: yesyrwon khelal annhar (They march during the day):** The text explicitly states that they march *at night*.

**Therefore, the correct answer is B: ykwn ladyhem makhzwen qelyel men al ta3am (They have little food reserves).**"

The text states:

*   Ant colonies nest in different stages.
*   During the migration phase, the ant army travels at night and stops building a camp during the day.
*   The colony's inhabitants start migrating when available food decreases.
*   During this phase, the colony's inhabitants build temporary dwellings that change daily.
*   Each of these revolutions or marches lasts for approximately 17 days.

Now let's evaluate the options:

*   **A: yabnwn a3shash khelal al layel (They build nests during the night):** The text says they travel at night and *don't* build a camp during the day. This contradicts the text.
*   **B: yesyerwen lemudat 17 yewmaan bidwon ta3sheysh (They travel for 17 days without nesting):** The text mentions 17 days as the approximate duration of the migration or revolution, but it also states they build temporary dwellings, so they are not without nests.
*   **C: yegheyrewn ala3shash yawmeyaan (They change nests daily):** The text says they build temporary dwellings that *change daily*. This directly matches the information in the text.
*   **D: yestekhedmewn ala3shash zataha fi kamel mudet mar7ala (They use the same nests for the entire duration of the stage):** This is the opposite of what the text states about changing the dwellings daily.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **C: yegheyrewn ala3shash yawmeyaan (They change nests daily).**"

Here's why:

*   Nature-based tourism focuses on experiencing and appreciating natural environments and wildlife directly.
*   A science museum, while potentially related to nature, is an indoor, curated exhibit. It does not involve directly experiencing the natural environment.

The other options all fit the definition:

Here's why:

*   **A: ta7sin fi qudrat al kitaba wa al qawa3id (Improvement in writing ability and grammar):** The paragraph explicitly states that students' writing and grammar improve due to the presence of an audience and the desire to avoid criticism.
*   **C: edrak aws3 ll bi2a almu7yta bhem (Wider awareness of the surrounding environment):** The paragraph mentions that blogging ""forces students to become more aware of the world around them.""
*   **D: zeyadh alrghabh fi mwaselt att3allum (Increased desire to continue learning):** The paragraph indicates that blogging inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.

The only option not explicitly mentioned in the benefits of blogging in the paragraph is a decrease in criticism from peers. While the paragraph mentions students trying to improve their writing to *avoid* criticism, it doesn't say that the criticism itself necessarily decreases."

Let's examine the other options:

*   C: al7efaz 3la ahetmam jumhurhem (Maintaining the interest of their audience) - The passage mentions that the need to spark audience interest inspires students to be intelligent and distinctive, but it doesn't primarily drive them to improve their basic writing skills. It's more about content and engagement.
*   D: al7ajeh li-atta3awun (The need for cooperation) - Collaboration is mentioned as a benefit of blogging, but not as the primary motivator for improving writing skills."

*   **B: wosol ela al-mudarrisin wajhan li wajh fi ay waqt men alywm (access to teachers face-to-face at any time of day)**: The passage specifically contrasts asynchronous communication with face-to-face meetings. It highlights the ability to send questions at any time and receive a reasonable response, instead of *waiting* for a face-to-face meeting. This option describes synchronous communication, not asynchronous.

Therefore, the most accurate answers, based on the provided text, are **C and D.**"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ayun men jawaneb alatesal gheyr alemtezamen atalyh leys marinan li ttullab?","The correct answer is **A: watirat at3alum (pace of learning)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Yuti7 li ttullab alqudra 3la al3amal wifqan li darajat taqaddumihim wa tta7akkum fi watirat alma3lumat atta3limiya."" This translates to: ""It allows students to work according to their progress and control the pace of educational information.""  This *directly* indicates that the pace of learning IS flexible.

* **The passage also mentions:** ""hunaka alqalil min alquyud azzamaniya ma3a imkaniyat sa3at 3amal marina."" This means: ""There are few time constraints with the possibility of flexible working hours."" So working hours are flexible

* **The passage further explains:** Yuti7u istikhdam al-internet wa shabakat alweb al3alamiya lil muta3allimin alwusul ila alma3lumat fi kul al-awqat. Means the use of the internet gives the learners access to materials at all times. So educational material is available all the time

Therefore, since the passage directly states that students CAN control the pace of learning, it cannot be a side of non-synchronous communication that isn't flexible.

*   The passage states that when Lord Hastings started building in the 1480s, the country was relatively peaceful, and defense was only necessary against small bands of roaming thieves. This directly supports the idea that the castle needed fewer fortifications because of the peaceful times.
*   Option A is incorrect as it directly contradicts the passage that describes the walls as thin.
*   Option C is incorrect because the castle not being heavily fortified for an attack matches the period it was built in.
*   Option D is incorrect because the passage explains that the castle's design (large glass windows and thin walls) wouldn't withstand a prolonged and strong attack."

*   **A: al nawafth al kabyra (Large windows)** are cited as a weakness because they would be vulnerable in a siege.

*   **D: judran ra8y8a (Thin walls)** are also mentioned as a vulnerability.

Since the goal of a castle is to withstand attack, and the passage indicates that Kirby Muxloe was **not** made to withstand an attack, then that is why the answer is B."
"wefqaan llfqrh, ayun men ataly seykewn alakether fa2edh l3eda2 yest2ed lelmewsem alemqebl?","Let's break down the passage and the question.

The passage (P) emphasizes the following:

*   Increasing the race distance from 1/4 mile to 1/2 mile makes speed less important and endurance crucial.
*   The ideal runner needs *some* speed (capable of breaking a 2-minute record), but *must* prioritize endurance.
*   Cross-country running in winter and upper body exercises are the *best* preparation for the racing season.

The question (Q) asks:  According to the passage, what is most beneficial for a runner preparing for the upcoming season?

Now let's look at the answer choices:

*   **A: aletderb 3la 3bwr albelad jeryaan fi alsyef (Training on cross-country running in the summer):**  The passage specifically mentions cross-country running during *winter* as beneficial. Summer is not mentioned, and implies a different condition which could affect endurance and preparation.
*   **B: altrekyez 3la seql alser3a khelal aletderyeb (Focus on refining speed during training):** The passage states that endurance is more important than speed when the distance increases.  Focusing on speed contradicts the passage's core argument.
*   **C: f3elha fi aqel men thelath deqa2eq (Do it in less than three minutes):** This option doesn't relate to preparing for the season, it is relating to what a runner is capable of. The passage mentions breaking a 2-minute record as a benchmark for speed, which is a smaller section of what is needed.
*   **D: alasetfadh men alenadey aleryadey letderyeb alejz' al'elewy men alejsem (Taking advantage of sports clubs to train the upper body):** The passage says that upper body exercises are beneficial. This is the closest answer, implying a location where one would train their upper body.

Given this analysis, the answer is:

**D: alasetfadh men alenadey aleryadey letderyeb alejz' al'elewy men alejsem (Taking advantage of sports clubs to train the upper body)**

This is the best answer because it aligns directly with a recommendation in the passage."

Here's why:

* **The paragraph states**: ""With the change from a quarter mile to a half mile, speed becomes much less important and endurance becomes paramount.""  This directly implies that focusing on speed *at the expense of endurance* is not the priority.  Endurance is now the critical factor.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aletderb 3la 3bwr alebled jeryaan khelal aِshher alesheta'** (Training in cross-country running during the winter months): The paragraph specifically mentions this as *good preparation* for the racing season.
* **B: seql aleqderh 3la aletheml 3la hesab alser3a** (Honing endurance at the expense of speed): The paragraph states that endurance is a supreme necessity so honing it is important
* **C: tesjeyl weqt aqel men deqyeqteyn** (Recording a time of less than two minutes): The paragraph mentions that an athlete should have a decent amount of speed, enough to have the potential to beat a two-minute record. Therefore, having the ability to do so is still an important characteristic for the runner.

Here's why:

* **P (The premise):** States that healthy nutritional practices alone can't *guarantee* excellent performance (""La yumkin...an tuwallida 2ada2an mutamayizan""), BUT they can significantly impact the health of young athletes in general.
* **Q (The question):** Asks ""For athletes, what *cannot* be achieved *solely* through good nutritional practices?"" (basically a rephrase of the premise)
* **C (ada' memtaz):** Aligns perfectly with the premise that excellent performance is *not* solely guaranteed by nutrition. The premise states it's a factor, but not the *only* factor.

"bena'an 3la alfqrh, ayun mema yely leys meqterhaan ketreyqh lelreyadeyyen aleshebab leyejad alemzeyd men aletmet' fi reyadethem?","Let's break down the original passage (P) and the question (Q) to find the best answer.

**Understanding Passage (P):**

The passage essentially states that while good nutrition alone won't *guarantee* outstanding performance, it significantly impacts the health of young athletes. Maintaining a healthy energy balance, practicing effective hydration habits, and understanding sports supplements all contribute to improved performance and increased enjoyment of sports.

**Understanding Question (Q):**

The question asks: ""Based on the paragraph, which of the following is NOT a suggestion for young athletes to find more enjoyment in their sport?""

**Analyzing the Options:**

*   **A: memaresh aletghedyh alemnasebh (Practicing proper nutrition):** The passage states that proper nutrition *helps* athletes enjoy their sport more. So, it IS a suggestion.

*   **B: teqdeym ada' 3la mestewa memtaz basetmerar (Consistently providing excellent performance):** The passage mentions that proper nutrition *helps improve performance*. While improved performance can lead to more enjoyment, the passage explicitly states that good nutrition *alone* cannot guarantee outstanding performance. The question asks for something that is NOT a suggestion, and aiming for consistently excellent performance is indirectly mentioned as a result of other factors, like nutrition.

*   **C: aletretyeb alef'eal (Effective hydration):** The passage specifically mentions effective hydration habits as contributing to improved performance and enjoyment. So, it IS a suggestion.

*   **D: al7efaz 3la tewazen shey leltaqh (Maintaining a healthy energy balance):** The passage clearly indicates that maintaining a healthy energy balance is important for improved performance and increased enjoyment. So, it IS a suggestion.

**Conclusion:**

Option B (Consistently providing excellent performance) is NOT explicitly mentioned as a direct way to increase enjoyment in the sport, but as a potential result of other behaviors (like proper nutrition, hydration, etc.). Therefore, it is the best answer.

**Final Answer:**

The correct answer is **B: teqdeym ada' 3la mestewa memtaz basetmerar**

"wefqaan llfqrh, lemaza qed yeshetrey 3da2 mesafat metwesth ma3edat akether teklefh?","The correct answer is **A: enha tefdeylathem aleshekhesyh ( انها تفضيلاتهم الشخصية ) - It is their personal preference.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...arriyadiyun annahum yufadhilun muntajan 7ata 3indama la yuwaffir fawa2id 7aqiqiya (قد يشعر الرياضيون أنهم يفضلون منتجا حتى عندما لا يوفر فوائد حقيقية) - Athletes may feel that they prefer a product even when it does not provide real benefits.""  This directly supports the idea of personal preference as the reason.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: lha fwa2ed muthebth ( لها فوائد مثبتة ) - It has proven benefits:**  The passage explicitly says the products often *don't* have real benefits.
* **C: sewf tuhesn men ada'ehem beshekl kebyer ( سوف تحسن من أدائهم بشكل كبير ) - It will greatly improve their performance:** Again, the passage indicates the opposite is true.
* **D: henak mefaheym khat'eh alety theyt balema3edat alaqel teklefh ( هناك مفاهيم خاطئة التي تثبت بالمعدات الأقل تكلفة ) - There are misconceptions that are proven by the less expensive equipment:** The passage mentions misconceptions about the *minimal equipment* required, but it doesn't say they're proven by less expensive equipment.  The key point is the *perceived* benefit, not a proven one.
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ma aledy yhetaj eleyh 3da2 alemsafat alemtewseth?","The correct answer is **C: ma3edat qelyelh lelghayh (Very few pieces of equipment)**

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Yu3addu arrak9 li masafatin mutawassita riyadha ghayr mukallifa nisbiyan"" which means ""Middle-distance running is considered a relatively inexpensive sport"".
*   It further mentions ""fima yt3laq bi ajza2 almu3iddat alqalila almatluba lil musharaka"" translating to ""regarding the few pieces of equipment required to participate.""

Therefore, the passage indicates that middle-distance running requires very little equipment."

"wefqaan llfqrh, ma aledy yejb an yefhemh alebsher beqwh leky yefserwa af'eal alakheryen alejsedyh?","The correct answer is **B: alenyh (النية - Intention)**.

The paragraph explicitly states that understanding the intentions of others (فهم نية الآخرين) is of utmost importance (أمر بالغ الأهمية) as it allows us to resolve potential ambiguity in physical actions.  The example of breaking a car window illustrates how different intentions (stealing vs. retrieving keys) change the interpretation of the same physical act.  The other options, desire, belief, and perspective, while related to understanding others, are not the primary focus of the argument in the paragraph.
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, yesa'ed fhem alenwaya alebsher 3la aleqyam bemada?","The correct answer is **A: aletkhels men 3dm aleyqeyn wera2 alaf3al alejsedyh** (getting rid of the uncertainty behind physical actions).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that understanding intentions allows us to resolve potential ambiguity in physical actions: ""yasma7u lana bi 7al alghumud almu7taml fil af3al aljasadiya."" This directly translates to resolving the ambiguity or uncertainty behind physical actions. The example of the person breaking the car window illustrates this perfectly; the action is the same, but the intent changes our understanding of the act.
The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: tewq3 alrghebat** (expecting desires): The passage mentions predicting what people desire, but the primary emphasis in the context of the question (understanding intentions) is on clarifying actions, not just anticipating desires.
*   **C: alnzar llbashar alakheryen bedwen 7ukm** (looking at other people without judgement): While empathy and avoiding hasty judgment are valuable, the passage focuses on how understanding intentions allows us to *interpret* actions accurately, not necessarily to avoid judgment altogether.
*   **D: qera2t 3qewl alakheryen** (reading other people's minds): The passage states that humans are quite good at reading minds, but the question is specifically asking about the benefits of understanding *intentions*, which is a more focused concept than general mind-reading.

**Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer because it directly reflects the passage's assertion that understanding intentions clarifies the ambiguity of physical actions.**"

*   **B: alet3eref 3la aleswet (Voice recognition):** Voice recognition is directly mentioned (""atta3aruf 3ala... assawt"").
*   **C: wed3 alejdawel (Scheduling):** Scheduling is explicitly mentioned in the passage (""atta7akum wa attakhtit wal jadwala"").
*   **D: aleqyam balemham beshekl aley (Performing tasks automatically):** The first sentence of the paragraph states that the main purpose of AI is to make machines to automate tasks.

Therefore, the most accurate and encompassing summary of the primary goal of AI is **D: aleqyam balemham beshekl aley (Performing tasks automatically)**. While A, B, and C are examples of what AI can do, D is the overarching goal.

This translates to: ""Examples include control, planning, and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, in addition to handwriting, voice, and face recognition.""

Therefore, based on the paragraph, the best answer is:

While the other options are mentioned, planning and scheduling are listed directly as examples of areas utilizing AI.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: thedyed 'edh ajewbh sheyhh lemsheklh ma (determining whether an answer is correct for a particular problem)**: While the passage states that this type of thinking focuses on finding the *one* correct answer, the strength isn't necessarily in *determining* its correctness, but rather in the processes that *lead* to the answer.

"wefqaan llfqrh, ayun mema yely la yu'etebr men mejalat terkeyz 'eqelyh aletfekyer aletjami3ey?","The passage describes convergent thinking as focusing on speed, logic, accuracy, identifying facts, reapplying existing techniques, and collecting information, with the understanding that there is only one correct answer.

*   **D: jema3 alema3elewmat (Collecting information):** This is also part of convergent thinking (""jami3 alma3lumat"").

*   **B: 3aqd alejbeyn (Frowning):** This is a facial expression that is detectable.

*   **C: alermesh besr'eh (Blinking rapidly):** Rapid blinking can be a sign of stress, nervousness, or lying.

*   **D: ref' alebham (Raising the thumb):** Raising the thumb (thumbs-up) is a conscious gesture with a clear meaning (approval, agreement, etc.). It's not a micro-expression and is a deliberate action, not a subtle, involuntary facial movement.

**Therefore, the answer is D: ref' alebham**

*   **It specifically mentions the possibility of detecting lies by correctly interpreting these micro-expressions.**
*   **Oliver Sacks' statement is introduced to highlight the idea that even those with brain damage (unable to understand speech) can accurately assess honesty based on non-verbal cues, hinting at the importance of facial expressions in this process.**
*   **There is no mention that Micro-expressions helps with understanding the speech.**

Therefore, option C is not supported by the provided text. Options A, B, and D are consistent with the information presented in the text."
ayun mema yely asebh akether ahemyh netyejhan 3a9r al-nah'9a? ,"Let's analyze the Arabic text and the question:

* **P (Premise):** The passage states that the ability to access knowledge and education has changed. The rate at which knowledge is acquired has changed. The approach to obtaining information is different. The emphasis is no longer on individual recall but on the ability to remember people. The Renaissance caused a significant change in the way we learn and disseminate knowledge.
* **Q (Question):** Which of the following is *most* important as a result of the Renaissance?

Now, let's evaluate the options:

* **A: altdekr alfardy (Individual Recall):** The passage *explicitly* states that individual recall is *less* emphasized now. Therefore, this is incorrect.
* **B: tedawel alema3erefh (Circulation of Knowledge):** The passage mentions that the Renaissance caused a change in the way we *learn and disseminate knowledge*. ""Disseminate"" strongly suggests increased circulation or sharing. This is a highly likely candidate.
* **C: tedker alens (Remembering People):** While the passage notes an increased focus on remembering people, it's presented as *one* consequence of the broader shift, not necessarily the *most important* one resulting from the Renaissance.
* **D: al7osol 3la alema3elewmat (Accessing Information):** The passage says the approach to *obtaining* information changed. While this is true, the concluding sentence directly links the Renaissance to changes in *learning and dissemination*. Dissemination goes beyond just accessing; it implies sharing and spreading knowledge.

**Conclusion:**

Option B, ""tedawel alema3erefh (Circulation of Knowledge),"" is the most directly related to the overall theme of the passage and its emphasis on the Renaissance's impact on learning and disseminating knowledge. It's a broader and more fundamental change than just remembering people.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: tedawel alema3erefh**.

This translates to ""There is no longer pressure in individual recall, but the ability to remember people has become more focused.""

This directly indicates that the focus on **individual recall** (istid3a2 al fardy) has decreased as a result of the Renaissance.  ""istid3a2 al fardy"" means ""individual recall"" or ""individual remembering"", and this is synonymous with ""altdekr alfardy.""

Therefore the answer is **A: altdekr alfardy**.

* Options A (establishing an email network), B (maintaining contact with family), and D (meeting new people) all align with these motives.  They reflect the internet's ability to facilitate relationships and social connections.
* Option C (searching for travel) is a practical use of the internet, but it doesn't directly relate to the social and relational motives emphasized in the text. It's more about information gathering and planning.

Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: alebheth 3an wesfh (Searching for recipes):** This is not necessarily directly related to personal participation or social interaction, although it *could* be if the person is sharing or discussing the recipes. But on its own, it's more about information seeking.

*   **C: alebheth 3an mentejat aler'eayh alsa7i7 (Searching for the right products):** This is primarily focused on finding the best product for individual needs or preferences, and does not strongly correlate with social interaction or personal participation.

*   **D: edarh alesh'ewen alemaleyh (Managing financial affairs):** This is a personal task focused on individual financial management. It has little to do with personal participation or relationship-building.

Therefore, options A, C, and D are more closely aligned with individual needs/tasks rather than social interactions. However, searching for recipes *could* involve some element of social participation, whereas managing financial affairs is the least likely to be related to personal participation.

(And yet, if we do not want a temporary solution only, we must find the root of the problem and solve it.) This directly supports option C as the long-term and practical solution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: meqat'eh kheyarat nemt alheyah alemterf (مقاطعة خيارات نمط الحياة المترف):** This translates to ""Boycotting extravagant lifestyle choices."" While reducing extravagance is beneficial, the paragraph indicates that this doesn't solve the root cause. This is similar to treating the symptoms of a disease rather than the disease itself.

* **B: alenshateyh (النشاطية):** This translates to ""Activism.""  While activism is valuable for raising awareness and advocating for change, it doesn't inherently address the underlying causes of environmental problems. It's more of a response to the symptoms.

* **D: an yesbh alemr' helyefaan lel7erkh aleby'eyh (أن يصبح المرء حليفًا للحركة البيئية):** This translates to ""Becoming an ally of the environmental movement."" Again, while beneficial, aligning with the environmental movement is more of an action based on the problem, not a solution to the core issue.

Therefore, only option C aligns with the paragraph's emphasis on finding and addressing the root cause of the problem for a long-term solution.

Here's why:

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Al-inkhirat fi al-anshita (الانخراط في الأنشطة):** which means **Engaging in activities** This option is likely talking about joining the environmental movement (as mentioned in the passage) and thus, considered a good solution mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Al-ta'abir 'an al-ara' hawl khiyarat namat al-hayat al-mutrif (التعبير عن الآراء حول خيارات نمط الحياة المترف):** which means **Expressing opinions about extravagant lifestyle choices**. This could be part of the solution, as it raises awareness of the root causes of the environmental issues, so it's not a way to only treat the symptoms.
*   **D: Al-'aysh bi-tariqa akthar sadiqa lil-bi'a (العيش بطريقة أكثر صداقة للبيئة):** which means **Living in a more environmentally friendly way.** The passage suggests to start living in more harmony with the environment, so it's not a way to only treat the symptoms.

*   **D: demn an alesfen alemhayedh len tet'ered lelkhetr (Ensured that neutral ships would not be exposed to danger):** The text clearly states that the blockade posed a danger *even* to neutral ships due to the mining of international waters. So, this is NOT an accurate description.

Therefore, the answer is **D**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a major neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
*   The passage also states that females are twice as likely to get MS than males.

Option A is the only female in the described age range (younger/middle-aged adult). The other answers are either male or a young child.

"wefqaan llfqrh, fi mada ahetaj alemsharekwen fi neshat bedney alemzeyd men aled'em?","The correct answer is **A: aletsewr alesleby lelalem (التصور السلبي للألم)**.

The passage states: ""Yakunu almusharikun fi nashat muntazam bi 7ajatin ila mazid mina adda3m 3indma yt3laq al2amr bi alnazarat alsilbiya lil 2alam"" which translates to ""Participants in regular activity need more support when it comes to negative views of pain.""

"wefqaan llfqrh, keyf temares alembarezh?","The correct answer is **D: benzam alemnazelh** (بنظام المنازلة).

The passage states: ""Tammat mumarasat hadhihi arriyadha fil bidaya 3la hay2at mubaraza, 7aythu yatanafas a7ad al-mubarizin amama al-akhar."" This translates to ""This sport was initially practiced in the form of a duel, where one combatant competes against the other."" Therefore, ""benzam alemnazelh"" (in the form of a duel/contest) is the most accurate answer.

"wefqaan llfqrh, ma hey alekhetwh alawela alemnasebh 3nd teqyeym dheyh?","The best translation of the passage is:

P: When examining a victim, you must wipe the scene of the incident to ensure your safety. You must observe the victim's condition as you approach them, and pay attention to any automatic warning signs. If you are exposed to harm while trying to help, you may only be making things worse.

Based on the paragraph, the first appropriate step when assessing a victim is to observe the scene. Therefore the answer is **A: Observation of the scene** (meraqebh alemshhed).
"
ayun men alejmel atalyh la y3kus bedqh 3malyh fhes dheyh?,"The correct answer is **A: La teqleq men tekbedk lesabat** (Don't worry about sustaining injuries).

Here's why:

*   **P (The passage)** emphasizes safety precautions during the examination of the victim. It stresses the importance of observing the victim's condition, being alert for warning signs, and avoiding actions that could worsen the situation if you are injured while trying to help.

*   **Q (The Question)** asks which of the following statements *does not* accurately reflect the process of victim examination described in the passage.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: La teqleq men tekbedk lesabat (Don't worry about sustaining injuries)** This directly contradicts the passage's emphasis on safety and avoiding harm.

*   **B: Qeym alemshhed qebl aledheyh (Assess the scene before the victim)** Although this isn't explicitly mentioned, it's a logical safety precaution implicitly related to ""mula7azt wadh3 aldha7iya wa anta taqtaribu minh"" (observing the victim's situation as you approach).

*   **C: Raqeb wed'eyh aledheyh (Monitor the victim's situation)** This aligns directly with ""mula7azt wadh3 aldha7iya"" (observing the victim's situation).

*   **D: Hawel melahezh ay ma3esherat khetr (Try to observe any signs of danger)** This corresponds with ""al-intbah ila ay 3lamat ta7ziriya tilqa2iya"" (being attentive to any automatic warning signs).

Therefore, option A, which suggests disregarding potential injuries, is the only statement that *does not* accurately reflect the passage's guidance on victim examination."

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that after the revolution, professions and the army became open to all qualified male applicants. This meant that success depended on ambition and excellence (merit) rather than social class (birthright).

Let's look at why the other options aren't the best fit:

*   **A: azedyad aled'em lelamh (Increased empowerment of the nation)** While the French Revolution did empower the nation, the passage doesn't directly emphasize it as the biggest change for working-class citizens specifically. It focuses more on the opportunity for individual advancement.

*   **C: tebney alayedyewlewjeyh alejmhewreyh (Adoption of republican ideology)** The adoption of Republican ideology is a significant change brought by the French Revolution. However, the question specifically asks about the impact on working-class citizens, and the passage states that post-revolution positions and the army opened up to all qualified male applicants. This resulted in success depending on ambition and excellence instead of social class.

*   **D: nezam qeyas jedyed (A new system of measurement)** The metric system is mentioned, but it doesn't have as direct and powerful an impact on the lives of working-class people as the shift to meritocracy. The metric system is more of a structural change, and not necessarily an impact on working-class citizens."
"b3d alethewrh alefrenseyh, kan alenjah fi alejyesh walemhen alakhera aqel ahetmalaan lan yekwen mebneyaan 3la mada?","Based on the passage, after the French Revolution, success in the army and other professions was **less likely to be based on social class** and more likely to be based on merit.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: aletbeqh (al-tabaqah - the social class)**. The passage states that military rank, which was previously based on social class, became based on excellence and importance after the revolution. Similarly, professions became open to all qualified men, allowing the most ambitious and outstanding to succeed.

The text explicitly states that ""Everyone almost complains about transportation systems"" and contrasts this with the rarity of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges in developed countries. This points directly to public transportation as the service most likely to cause dissatisfaction.

The passage clearly states that ""Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems."" This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: yhebha jami3 men yestekhedmha** (Everyone who uses it loves it): This is the opposite of what the passage says.
*   **B: leyset benfes sew' jewdh alemyah** (Not as bad as water quality): The passage says you *don't* hear the same level of complaints about water quality or bridges, implying transportation is worse in terms of complaints.

**D: tedfeq alemrewr (traffic flow)**

The paragraph states that studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior is unpredictable. Traffic flow is a direct consequence of driver behavior. The other options relate to activities that can be planned and designed, and therefore are not as directly affected by the unpredictability of individual driver behavior.
"
ayun mema yely yusetkhedm 3nd temtheyl 7erkh merwer reyadeyaan?,"Based on the Arabic text, the correct answer is **D: كثافة المرور (kathafa alemrewr) - Traffic density**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the relationship between three main characteristics – flow, density, and speed – is used to represent traffic flow mathematically and is helpful in planning, designing, and operating road facilities.  Density is one of those three main characteristics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: تشغيل الطرق (teshegheyl aletreq) - Operating roads:** While the relationship between flow, density, and speed *helps* in operating roads, it's not what's directly used to represent traffic flow mathematically.
*   **B: سلوك السائق (selwek alesa'eq) - Driver behavior:** Driver behavior is difficult to predict, which is why mathematical representations are approximations. Driver behavior isn't the *representation* itself.
*   **C: تصميم الطرق (tesmeym aletreq) - Designing roads:** Similar to option A, the relationship helps in designing roads, but it's not the representation itself.

**Therefore, the most accurate answer is D.**"

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yumkin faqt naql attafrat fi khalaya alkhat aljurthumy ila al-atfal"" which translates to ""Only mutations in germ line cells can be passed on to children.""  ""Khat aljurthumy"" is the ""germ line"".

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ahemyh alemadh alewratheyh** (Importance of the genetic material): While the importance of the genetic material affected *influences the effect* of the mutation, it doesn't determine if it will be passed on.
*   **C: new' aletferh** (Type of mutation): The type of mutation influences the effect, not the heritability.
*   **D: eda kanet aletferh qaderh 3la aletsebb fi mewt alekhelaya** (If the mutation is capable of causing cell death): Cell death would prevent the mutation from being passed on through that specific cell, but it is the cell type that determines heritability.

Therefore, only mutations occurring in germ line cells (cells that give rise to eggs or sperm) can be inherited.

This translates to: ""Mutations can have a diverse range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected pieces of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.""

Let's break down how this relates to the options:

*   **B: eda kanet alekhelaya alemtatherh fi alekhet alenetashey** (Whether the affected cells are in the germline) - The passage *explicitly states* that this *does* affect the outcome.
*   **C: ahemyh alemadh alewratheyh alemtatherh** (The importance of the affected genetic material) - The passage *explicitly states* that this *does* affect the outcome.
*   **D: new' aletferh alemtatherh** (The type of the affected mutation) - The passage *explicitly states* that this *does* affect the outcome.
*   **A: meqdar alemadh alewratheyh alemtatherh** (The amount of affected genetic material) - While ""qit3an almada alwirathiya almuta2athira"" translates to ""pieces of the affected genetic material"", the passage specifically refers to the *importance* of those pieces, not necessarily the *amount* of affected DNA.

Therefore, the effects of different mutations *depend* on the type of mutation, importance of the genetic material, and if the cells are germline or not, but **do not depend on the amount of affected genetic material**."

*   B: sa'edet fi r'ey alared (Helped in grazing the land) - The passage mentions that they grazed on hills and pastureland, so this is related to grazing the land. While not *directly* stated as a reason for raising them, their grazing habits were undoubtedly useful and related.
*   C: qedmet mezamelh (Provided companionship) - This is **NOT** mentioned in the passage.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Wa ma3a dhalik fa inna ijra2 attajarib wa7dahu la yakfi"" meaning ""However, carrying out experiments alone is not enough"". This implies that the scientific method, which relies heavily on experiments, alone isn't sufficient for guiding scientific research. It needs other elements like observation and hypothesis testing.
*   The passage mentions, ""... ibda2 almula7azat yuwajih alba7th al3ilmy kadhalik"" (""and making observations also guides scientific research""), meaning observation is helpful for guiding scientific research.
*   The passage mentions, ""... attjriba hiya bi mathabat ikhtibar yustakhdam li izalat faradhiya wa7ida aw akthar min alfradhiyat almu7tamala"" (""The experiment is like a test used to remove one or more of the possible hypotheses""), meaning eliminating potential hypotheses is helpful for guiding scientific research.
* The passage explicitly states that the scientific method is not the *only* way to guide scientific research, and that experiments alone are not enough.

Therefore, the other options (making observations, disproving potential hypotheses, and conducting experiments) all contribute to guiding scientific research, while the scientific method by itself is not sufficient, according to the passage."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: eadh ma tedwem lakether men thelath sa'eat (It doesn't last for more than three hours)** - The passage states that only 2% of the *strongest* tornadoes last longer than three hours, implying that *most* last *less* than three hours. It doesn't say it does *not* last for more than three hours.
*   **B: tuhedth reyahaan hewaley 480 meyl fi alesa'eh (It generates winds around 480 miles per hour)** - The passage states the fastest winds can *reach* 480 km/h. This is not the same as the average or most common wind speed. The original question is in miles, so this isn't correct.

**A: hew yeqder aleslam wal'euzelh** (He appreciates Islam and isolation)

Here's why:

*   The paragraph states that Muhammad (SAW) paid great attention to matters beyond this worldly life.
*   He frequently visited the cave of Hira on Mount Al-Nour to contemplate the universe.
*   The cave itself is described as isolated, offering complete seclusion.
*   Entering the cave leads to total isolation, with limited sensory input from the outside world.

These points indicate that Muhammad (SAW) valued isolation as a means to pursue spiritual reflection and contemplation.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: yemken leldejyej alekharejy an yusa'ed fi aletfekr** (External noise can help in thinking): This is incorrect because the passage clearly mentions that Ghar Hira provides isolation and removes external sounds.
*   **C: kan yhetaj lelqelyel jedaan men alewqet bemferdh** (He needed very little time alone): This is incorrect because the text says he frequently went to the cave which takes time.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Tudhif attafra tanawu3an jiniyan jadidan wa **yuziluha al-intiqa2 min majmu3at attabayun almu3abbari 3anhu**."" This part explains that selection removes diversity from the expressed variance group.

*   And states: ""**Ya3malu alfasl wa i3adat attarkib 3ala tabdil attabayun dhahaban wa iyaban bayna almajmu3atayn ma3a kulli jil.**"" This statement confirms that separation and recombination do not remove genetic diversity.

*   The passage also states: ""hunak majmw3atan min al-tanwu3at al-jyniya: makhfiya wa'6ahira"" which means ""there are two groups of genetic diversity: hidden and obvious."" The expressed variance group is the obvious variance.

The question ""yezyel alanetqa' alakhetlafat alewratheyh alejdeydh men ay tejmey'eh?"" means ""From which group does selection remove the new genetic variations?""

The passage indicates that selection removes diversity from the expressed variance group, so the remainder variations are the hidden/latent variance group. Thus the correct answer is A."

*   **The problem:** Primates in savanna environments struggle to get essential amino acids from plant sources. Lack of these leads to slow growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
*   **Plant sources and their limitations:** Leaves and legumes are protein sources but hard to digest *unless cooked*.
*   **Animal sources and their benefits:** Insects (ants, termites, eggs) are easier to digest and provide all essential amino acids.
*   **Conclusion:** Our ancestors likely solved the ""protein problem"" in a similar way to savanna chimpanzees today.

Given that primates have trouble digesting raw leaves and legumes, and that animal sources like insects are both easier to digest and provide a complete protein source, the best answer is:

**C: Al-Janadeb (Locusts)** (Since Locusts are an insect, it falls in the category of animal food sources.)

**Therefore, the correct answer is C.**"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ayun men alemsheklat atalyh la yenjem 3nd neqs alahemad alameyneyh aledrewreyh?","Based on the paragraph, the following are consequences of a lack of essential amino acids:

*   **Slow growth (ibta2 alnumuw)**
*   **Malnutrition (su2 attaghdhiya)**
*   **Eventual death (al mawt almu7attam fi annihaya)**

The paragraph also mentions that plant resources like leaves and legumes are hard to digest. Therefore, problems with digestion are a separate issue, not directly caused by the lack of essential amino acids itself, but rather a challenge in obtaining them from plant sources.

Therefore, the answer is **A: meshakel alhedm (problems with digestion)**."

This translates to ""Often, members of a subculture indicate their affiliation through a distinct and symbolic use of a style, which includes fashion, behaviors, and dialects."" This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: eber mhawelh alanedmaj** (Through attempting integration): While some subcultures might seek some level of integration, this isn't the primary way they signal membership. Subcultures often distinguish themselves from the mainstream.
*   **B: eber tebney qena'eat alejmey' men 7wlhem** (Through adopting the convictions of everyone around them): This is the opposite of what subcultures do. They often challenge or differ from the prevailing beliefs of the larger society.
*   **C: eber qebwel ala'eraf alajetma'eyh** (Through accepting social norms): Again, this is contradictory to the nature of many subcultures, which often deviate from or challenge social norms.

*   Specifically, the passage mentions that if children from a minority group are portrayed as underperforming, they may start underperforming themselves once they learn about those stereotypes.
*   Therefore, if a child from a minority group is subject to stereotypes associating their group with ""challenging behavior"", they are likely to change their behavior and be less likely to engage in such behavior."

Let's analyze why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yenjem aghelb aleslewk alewheshey 3an ale'eaqh alejsedyh (Most wild behavior results from physical impairments):** The passage mentions that in some cases, parents abandoned children *because* of physical or mental impairments, but it doesn't say that physical impairments *cause* wild behavior. The lack of socialization is the primary cause.
*   **C: Aleslewk alewheshey sa'ed feqt leda alatefal aledy hebshem waledyhem (Wild behavior is only common in children whose parents imprisoned them):** While the passage mentions that some feral children were imprisoned by their parents, it also describes other scenarios like abandonment or being raised by animals. Thus, parental imprisonment is not the *only* cause.
*   **D: Kel aleslewk alewheshey najem 3an e'eaqat 'eqelyh shedyedh (All wild behavior results from severe mental impairments):** Similar to option A, the passage mentions mental impairments as a *reason* for abandonment in some cases, but not as a *direct cause* of the wild behavior itself.

ayun men alejmel atalyh yesf bedqh menhej ma b3d aletmedn alta3lemey?,"Let's break down the original text (P) and the answer options to determine the best fit.

**Understanding Text P:**

Text P essentially argues against a single, absolute ""good"" way of learning or even a single ""good"" thing to learn. It emphasizes experiential learning, a dynamic process where the learner interacts with the information. It criticizes passive learning experiences, where people watch shows about things they'll never actually *do*.  The core idea is that learning is subjective and dependent on the individual's experience. The key points are:

*   No single best learning method exists.
*   No single best subject to learn exists.
*   Learning is experiential.
*   Passive consumption of information is not necessarily effective.
*   Freedom from absolutes in learning.

**Analyzing the Answer Options:**

*   **A: b3d aletjareb alta3lemeyh akether fa2edh men gheyrha (Some learning experiences are more beneficial than others).**  This *could* be interpreted as aligning with P, as passive experiences are implicitly viewed as less beneficial. However, P's main point is that it is a matter of experience and context of learning. It's not necessarily saying there are inherently ""more beneficial"" experiences.
*   **B: yejb an yerkez alta3lem 3la alasheya2 alety n3eteqd anena sewf nekhetberha (Learning should focus on things we expect to experience).** This aligns well with P's criticism of learning about things you'll never do or apply. It is in line with the idea of a dynamic process between the learner and presented knowledge.
*   **C: b3d aletreq alta3lemeyh afedl men gheyrha (Some learning methods are better than others).** This directly contradicts P, which states there is no single ""good"" method.
*   **D: la yewjed metleqat fi alta3lem (There are no absolutes in learning).** This is the MOST accurate summary. P starts by discussing ""atta7arrur min almutlaqat"" (liberation from absolutes) and consistently argues against the idea of a single ""right"" way to learn or a single ""right"" thing to learn.

**Conclusion:**

Option **D** is the closest to reflecting the core idea of the original text. It directly addresses the concept of not having absolutes in learning, while option B provides one case in support of that concept. Therefore, based on the information provided, the best choice is **D**.
"
ayun men alejmel ataly la y3kus bedqh menhej ma b3d aletmedn alta3lemey?,"Based on the passage P, the statement that **does not** accurately reflect the post-modernist learning approach is:

**B: yejb e3eta2 b3d aletjareb alta3lemeyh alawelweyh 3la aletreq alakhera** (Some learning experiences should be prioritized over other methods.)

Here's why:

*   **The core idea of the passage:**  The passage emphasizes the rejection of a single ""good"" method of learning and even a single ""good"" thing to learn. It highlights the subjective experience of learning and the interaction between the learner and the presented knowledge.

*   **Why B is incorrect:**  Post-modern learning, as presented in the passage, doesn't advocate for prioritizing certain learning experiences over others. It values the individual's interaction with information, regardless of whether it leads to immediate practical application. The passage argues that watching a TV show about fixing a car, even if you never intend to fix one yourself, still contributes to the learning process. The passage advocates against prioritization of learning experience and against considering other method of learning inferior.

*   **Why the other options are consistent with the passage:**
    *   **A: henak al3adid men aletreq let'eleym alema3elewmat** (There are many ways to learn information) - This aligns with the rejection of a single ""right"" method.
    *   **C: t3tamed tejrebh t3eleymeyh 3la almut3alem wa al ma3erefh al mqedmh** (A learning experience depends on the learner and the presented knowledge) - This reflects the interactive nature of learning emphasized in the passage.
    *   **D: alema3erefh alety qed la netbeqha abedaan tebqa jedyerh bat3alam** (Knowledge that we may never apply remains worth learning) - This reflects how a post-modern approach to learning does not mean that some knowledge is inferior because one does not think that they will apply it in the future.

**In conclusion, B contradicts the core message of the passage, which is about the subjectivity of learning and the rejection of any single ""best"" approach or subject.**"

*   The passage describes sleep interruption (inqita3 annawm) as waking up intentionally during your normal sleep cycle and going back to sleep after a short period (10-60 minutes).
*   Option C describes turning off the alarm and going back to sleep after 20 minutes, which fits the definition given in the passage.

*   The question asks: **ayun mema yely leys wesfaan deqyeqaan laneqta' alnwm?** which roughly translates to: ""Which of the following is NOT an accurate description of sleep interruption?""
*   Let's look at the options:

    *   **A: yemken an yekwen mebneyaan 3la nezm heyweyh** which translates to: ""It can be based on a biological system"" (This is true, as the text mentions methods based on circadian rhythms)
    *   **B: alhedf hew 3dm eyeqaz nefsek beshekl kamel** which translates to: ""The goal is not to wake yourself up completely"" (This is true, the text mentions using a low-volume alarm)
    *   **C: thedth al3malyh khelal fetrh alnwm atabey3eyh** which translates to: ""The process occurs during the normal sleep period"" (This is true, as defined in the first sentence)
    *   **D: b3d alasetyeqaz, alhedf hew al'ewedh ela alnwm khelal sa'eteyn** which translates to: ""After waking up, the goal is to return to sleep within two hours"" (This is **FALSE**. The text specifies a short time of 10-60 minutes).

Here's why:

The passage states that experiencing many artificially induced lucid dreams can be exhausting. The reason given is that these vivid dreams extend the time *between* REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep cycles. A decrease in REM cycles, according to the text, means fewer periods where your body truly rests and recovers, leading to fatigue.

(With a smaller number of rapid eye movements at night, these conditions in which you feel actual sleep and your body recovers become rare enough to become a problem).

The passage directly links the negative impact (being exhausting) to a *decrease* in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Yatamatta3una 3ala al aghlab bi istiqlaliya akbar min a3dha2 alfariq attaqlidiyin"" (Virtual team members generally have more autonomy than traditional team members). This directly implies that traditional teams have less autonomy.

Let's analyze why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: alefreq aletqelyedyh mutalebh betheqyeq ma3eayeyr a3la** (Traditional teams are required to meet higher standards): The passage mentions that virtual teams are subject to the same standards as traditional teams, although there are subtle differences, but does not specifically mention that traditional teams are required to meet higher standards.
*   **B: ghalebaan ma tetserf alefreq alafetradeyh kenqeth tewasel lelferq aletqelyedyh** (Virtual teams often act as points of contact for traditional teams): The passage states that virtual team *members* often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group, not the team as a whole.
*   **D: yemken an tufeyd alemnateq alezmenyh alemtenw'eh alefreq alafetradeyh** (Different time zones can benefit virtual teams): While the passage mentions that virtual teams meet across different time zones, which their local managers might not understand, it doesn't explicitly state that this situation is beneficial to the team.

Let's analyze the options in light of this:

*   **A: enesha' munetleq lelmekan aledy qed yewd' feyh alemwedw' (Creating a launchpad for the place where the subject may be placed)** - This is in line with using the intersections of the lines to position the main subject.

*   **B: enesha' heyah wetaqh demn sewrh (Creating vitality and energy within the image)** - The passage states the rule creates 'dynamic movement', so this is a correct goal.

*   **C: ebeqa' alemwedw' demn mekan mhedd wef'eal (Keeping the subject within a specific and effective place)** - This aligns with placing the subject at the intersections of the dividing lines.

*   **D: taseys nezam demn sewrh (Establishing order within the image)** - The passage notes the rule maintaining 'order in the picture'.

Based on the above, the statement that *is not* a goal of the rule of thirds is **C: ebeqa' alemwedw' demn mekan mhedd wef'eal (Keeping the subject within a specific and effective place)**.
While it might seem like the point of the rule of thirds, that goal is too specific. The rule suggests *where* to put the subject, but does not necessarily 'keep' the subject there in the sense of confinement. Therefore, option C is the best answer.

ayun men ataly la yesf bedqh nemwedj al 35 mm leltesweyr?,"The correct answer is **C: lha nesbh ab'ead mekhetlefh 3an al3adid men aletnesyeqat alesha'e'eh (لها نسبة ابعاد مختلفة عن العديد من التنسيقات الشائعة - It has different aspect ratio than many popular formats)**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that many popular formats (like APS formats) are *equal to or close to* the 3:2 aspect ratio of 35mm. This directly contradicts option C, which claims it has a *different* aspect ratio than many popular formats.

Let's analyze the other options:

*   **A: ma tezal tunetj (ما تزال تنتج - it is still being produced)** This is correct according to the passage (""La yazal yajry entajuh 7atta al-yawm"" - It is still being produced until today).
*   **B: tebnetha tenseyqat alekameyra alerqemyh (تبنتها تنسيقات الكاميرا الرقمية - It has been adopted by digital camera formats)** This is also true according to the passage (""walakin al-aham min thalik anna nisbat al-3ar'9 ela al-artifa3 8ad 2ktasabatha tansy8at mustash3ir 9uwar al-kamyra al-ra8miya"" - But more importantly, the aspect ratio has been acquired by digital camera sensor formats.)
*   **D: hey alesyeghh alakether sheyw'eaan fi al'ealem (هي الصيغة الأكثر شيوعا في العالم - It is the most common format in the world)** This is stated in the first sentence.

Therefore, option C is the only one that does *not* accurately describe the 35mm format based on the given text."
"wefqaan llfqrh, feyma yezyed alemusen'ewen men jewdh anetaj al'edesat, keyf thesnet 'edesat aletkebyer?","The correct answer is **C: jewdh sewrha meshabhh lel'edesat dat tewl aleb'erey alethabet** (Its image quality is similar to lenses with fixed focal length).

The passage states: ""8ad sama7 thalik al-amr li3adasat al-mu8arraba bi2ntaj 9uwar bijuwda tu'9ahy tilk allaty 7a8a8atha al-3adasat that al-bu3d al-bu2riy al-thabit."" This translates to ""This has allowed zoom lenses to produce images with quality that rivals those achieved by fixed focal length lenses."" Therefore, improved manufacturing standards led to zoom lenses having a comparable image quality to prime lenses.
"
"bena'an 3la alema3elewmat fi alfqrh, meta qed tekwen 'edesh tekbeyr mufedlh 3la 'edesh awelyh?","Based on the information in the paragraph, the correct answer is:

**A: eda kanet alefthh alaqesa al'ealeyh awelweyh (If a wide aperture is a priority)**

Here's why:

*   The passage states a disadvantage of zoom lenses is that their maximum aperture (speed) is usually smaller. A smaller aperture means less light enters the lens.
*   Therefore, if a wide aperture (which allows more light in, enabling better low-light performance) is important to you, a zoom lens might *not* be the preferred choice. The question asks when a zoom lens might be preferred, so we need the opposite scenario.

Let's analyze the other options:

*   **B: eda aredt 3anaser 'edesat aqel (If you want fewer lens elements):** The passage states zoom lenses require *more* elements than prime lenses, making this incorrect.
*   **C: eda kent la teryed asetkhedam aleflash fi bey'eh mezlemh (If you don't want to use flash in a dark environment):** The passage says the smaller aperture of zoom lenses makes them difficult to use in low light *without* a flash. So this is the opposite of when a zoom lens would be preferred.
*   **D: eda kent tebheth 3an t'eqeyd b'erey akebr (If you are looking for greater complexity):** The passage states that zoom lenses are more complex than prime lenses. This makes this choice an attribute of a zoom lens that may make it less desirable in some situations.

Therefore, only option A correctly identifies a situation where a zoom lens might *not* be preferred, implying that the opposite situation (aperture is not a priority) would make a zoom lens acceptable."
ayun men ataly la yu'etebr wesfaan deqyeqaan lelteswef?,"Let's analyze each option in relation to the definition of Attasawwuf (Sufism) provided in statement P:

*   **A: henak terkeyz 3la tejrebh halat alederak aleslemyh walembhejh (There is a focus on experiencing states of peaceful awareness and joy)** This aligns perfectly with the description in P, which mentions ""tattasem bi taba3 selmiy, aw nafadh al basira, aw bi ssa3ada wa nna3im, aw 7atta al esteghraq fil ebtihaj al ghamer"" (characterized by peacefulness, insight, happiness and bliss, or even immersion in overwhelming delight). So, this is a characteristic of Sufism.

*   **B: ateba' aleswefyh yes'ewen lew'ey ederakey lheqyeqh rewhaneyh (Followers of Sufism seek a conscious perception of spiritual reality)** This is also a core aspect of Sufism. Statement P explicitly states that it's ""assa3iy wara2 attawasol al 3amiq aw al edrak al wa3i li 7aqiatin ... 7aqiqa rou7iyya"" (the pursuit of deep connection or conscious awareness of a... spiritual reality).

*   **C: qed yetbena ateba' aleswefyh memaresat tesa'ed fi t'ezeyz r'eyethem lelheqyeqh alelheyh (Followers of Sufism may adopt practices that help foster their vision of divine reality)** Statement P says:""Yas3a al mutabi3un ila turoq mu3ayyana lil 3aysh, aw mumarasat tahdifu ila ri3ayat telka attajareb"" (Followers strive for specific ways of living, or practices aimed at nurturing those experiences), which is in harmony with this option.

*   **D: aletrekyez 3la ales'ey wera' tejrebh shekhesyh yemken meqarenth ma3 al3adid men ashekal alema3eteqdat aledyenyh wal'ebadh (The focus on seeking personal experience can be compared to many forms of religious belief and worship)** This statement is the *least* accurate description of Sufism according to the given text. The emphasis in Sufism is on a *unique* personal experience, as highlighted in P: ""Yumkinu tamyiz attasawwuf 3an ghayrihi min al ashkal al u5ra lil mu3taqad addini wal 3ibada min 5ilal ta2kidihi 3ala attajruba al sha5siya al mubashara li 7ala min al wa3iy *farida min naw3iha*"" (Sufism can be distinguished from other forms of religious belief and worship by its emphasis on direct personal experience of a state of awareness *unique in its kind*). This emphasizes that it is distinct from the personal experience that one might find in other religious beliefs. The distinguishing factor of the personal experience is what makes Sufism unique, not something that can be compared with other religious ideas.

**Therefore, the answer is D.**"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ayun mema yely leys demn terkeyz aleswefyh?","Based on the paragraph provided, the focus of Sufism *is not* option B: **ales'ey ela r'eyh men khelal aletjareb alemshetrekh walejma'eyh (Seeking an opinion through shared and collective experiences)**

Here's why:

*   The paragraph emphasizes **personal, direct experience** (attajruba al sha5siya al mubashara) of a unique state of consciousness. This contradicts the idea of seeking opinions or understanding through collective experiences. Options A, C and D, are all mentioned in the paragraph, therefore not the correct answer.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B**.

"wefqaan llfqrh, men aledy qed beda mejtema3eaan zera'eyaan?","Based on the paragraph, the correct answer is **D: Maori men aleyabesh** (Maori from the mainland).

"
"wefqaan llfqrh, alemjemw'eh alety asetadet alemwas kanewa aleskan alawa'el lay mewq'e?","The correct answer is **B: New Zealand**.

This translates to: ""For a long time during the 19th and 20th centuries, it was believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori people, who hunted the giant birds called moas.""

This clearly indicates that the Moa hunters (Maori) were believed to be the first inhabitants *of New Zealand*.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the simple origami method developed by John Smith is designed to help novice hobbyists or those with limited motor skills. This suggests that it's appropriate for people with little to no experience or those who might struggle with more complex folding techniques. Trying it once or twice is a reasonable level of experience for someone who would benefit from a simple method.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   A: If the hobbyist prefers complex folds, they wouldn't need a simplified method.
*   B: If the hobbyist has advanced motor skills, they wouldn't need a simplified method.
*   C: The hobbyist would prefer a traditional origami method if they're completing complex origami

So, option D aligns with the description of the method's intended audience."

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that John Smith developed this method for **inexperienced folders** or those with limited motor skills. Option A directly contradicts this.
*   Options B, C, and D all accurately reflect information presented in the passage."
"wefqaan llfqrh, ay mewq' leys mertebtaan bhedarh wadey alesned?","The correct answer is **A: Harappa**. Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** The Harappa site was the *first* of its kind to be excavated. It doesn't mention it NOT being related to the Indus Valley Civilization.
*   **Harappa** is named as the first site to be excavated of this civilization.

**The other options are mentioned in the passage:**

*   **B: nher Sarasvati**: The passage mentions some scholars call the civilization Indus-Sarasvati because of the Sarasvati river.
*   **C: jami3 alemnateq fi shemal sherq Afghanistan**: The passage states that the civilization extended to parts of northeastern Afghanistan.

Here's why:

*   **7adarat al-Harappiyah (Harappan civilization):** The passage explicitly mentions that some call it the Harappan civilization.
*   **7adarat Nahr al-Sind (Indus River civilization):** The passage mentions that its name is derived from the Indus River.
*   **7adarat Wadi al-Sind (Indus Valley civilization):** The passage starts by saying it is a civilization of the Bronze Age in the Indus Valley.
*   **7adarat al-Sind wa Sarasvati (Indus-Sarasvati civilization):** The passage mentions that some scholars suggest calling it the Indus-Sarasvati civilization *because* of the presence of settlements in the Sarasvati river basin *in addition* to the Indus.

Therefore, the Indus-Sarasvati civilization is mentioned as another name possibility.

* The paragraph emphasizes that while selfishness might yield short-term gains, cooperation is the best strategy for long-term benefit.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: e'eta' alawelweyh lelmesalh aledateyh lelferd (Giving priority to the individual's self-interest)**: This contradicts the paragraph's main point, which argues against selfishness.
* **C: aletakeyd 3la ma yemken an y'ewed balefa'edh lelaqelyh 3la hesab alaghelbeyh (Focusing on what can compensate the minority for the loss at the expense of the majority)**: This is not mentioned in the paragraph.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that selfishness and egoism (al ananiya) always exist.
*   It also says that in cooperation, while the majority benefits, there's *always* a greater short-term gain from acting selfishly.
*   The question asks what a person focused on immediate gains would prioritize.

Therefore, someone prioritizing short-term benefits would logically prioritize **selfishness (alananiya)**."

Here's why:

*   The text mentions the use of morphine and scopolamine as pain relievers or anesthetics.
*   It also describes amputation, ligatures, and arterial clamps as surgical techniques.
*   There's no mention of treating PTSD or using sedatives specifically for that purpose. While they might have used sedatives for other reasons, the text doesn't connect it to PTSD.

*   **D: Emperor's recruitment of doctors (تجنيد الامبراطور للأطباء)** - The passage explicitly mentions that Emperor Augustus began enlisting doctors.

The passage directly links the ""military nature of the Roman Empire"" to the advancement of medicine. Therefore:

*   **B: The aggressive military policy of the Empire (سياسة الامبراطورية العسكرية العدوانية)** is also connected, as the need for medical care on the battlefield spurred innovation.

The passage does **not** mention the creation of teaching hospitals. Therefore, the answer is:

*   **C: Establishment of teaching hospitals (إنشاء مستشفيات التعليم)**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Yumaththel al morshed arru7i a7ad al jawaneb al asaseyya le jami3 al deyanat al hindeyya wa laken fi SSikhiyya 2ektasaba ahameyya tushakkel jawhar mo3taqadat As-sikh."" (The spiritual guide represents one of the fundamental aspects of *all* Indian religions, but in Sikhism it has gained importance that forms the core of Sikh beliefs.) This means while teachers (Gurus) are essential, the passage *explicitly* says it is not unique to Sikhism, only that it is more central to their beliefs.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate based on the text:

*   **A: kanet alesyekheyh netyejh aneqsam ta'efi dakhel aletqaleyd alhendewseyh** (Sikhism was the result of a sectarian division within Hindu traditions): The passage states: ""Nasha2at fi mentaqat al Punjab 5ilal al qaren al 5ames 3ashar min enqesam ta2efe da5el attaqaled al Hendoseyya."" (It arose in the Punjab region during the fifteenth century from a sectarian division within Hindu traditions.) This is a direct quote.
*   **C: khelf ts3 mu3llemyn b3d mu2eses aldyen, Guru Nanak** (Nine teachers followed the founder of the religion, Guru Nanak): The passage states: ""Wa qad 5alafahu 3ala ttawali tes3at mu3allimin 2a5arin."" (He was succeeded by nine other teachers in succession.) This is accurate.
*   **D: b3d teqaleyd alesyekheyh metjedrh fi alhendewseyh** (Some Sikh traditions are rooted in Hinduism): The passage states: ""3ala al rughem min 2e3terafehem bi judhur al-Hendoseyya wa taqalidiha."" (Despite their recognition of Hindu roots and traditions.) This confirms that some Sikh traditions have roots in Hinduism.

Therefore, option B is the only one that misrepresents the information provided in the passage."
"wefqaan llfqrh, ay mema yely y'etebr janebaan asaseyaan men nezam alema3eteqdat Asssi5iyya?","Based on the paragraph, the correct answer is:

**A: mefhewm al mu3allem (مفهوم المعلم) - The concept of the teacher/guru**

(The spiritual guide represents one of the basic aspects of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism it has gained an importance that forms the essence of Sikh beliefs.)

Let's analyze the other options:

*   **B: al-taqalid al-Hendoseyya (التقاليد الهندوسية) - Hindu traditions:** The paragraph mentions that Sikhism has Hindu roots and traditions, but it emphasizes that Sikhs consider their religion separate from Hinduism. So, while related, it's not a *core* tenet of their belief system.
*   **C: refd ala3teraf bi al deyanat al hindeyya alakhera (رفض الاعتراف بالديانات الهندية الأخرى) - Refusal to recognize other Indian religions:** The paragraph doesn't mention any rejection or denial of other Indian religions.
*   **D: alethedth balelghh al-Punjabia (التحدث باللغة البنجابية) - Adherence to the Punjabi language:** While Punjabi is the language of the term ""Gurmat,"" the paragraph focuses more on the concept of the ""Gurmat"" (the teacher's way) rather than the language itself being a core belief."

"
ay mma yly yjb 3la alnas tjnb f'elh balmwz?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: alaqtrab bbt' shdyd (Approaching it very slowly).**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that people put themselves at risk by getting too close to the pronghorn antelope when the animal perceives a threat. Approaching slowly still means getting close enough to potentially trigger a defensive reaction from the antelope.
*   The passage explicitly stated that the pronghorn antelope is not violent in nature unless it senses danger and so people can avoid being in danger by reducing the amount of danger a pronghorn antelope is feeling and so the best way to do that is by not approaching it.

Let's examine the other options:

*   A: tjahl wjwdhm (Ignoring their presence) : This is vague and doesn't directly address the danger of being perceived as a threat.
*   C: altqlyl ela adna hd mn mstwa althdyd almhtml (Minimizing the potential threat level): While ideally what people should do, it's not as actionable as simply not approaching the animal. The passage suggests the *distance* is a critical factor in whether the antelope feels threatened.
*   D: mraqbthm mn msafh b3eydh (Observing them from a distance): This is the safest option and aligns perfectly with avoiding being perceived as a threat.

Therefore, the best answer is **B**."
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ay mn al'ebarat altalyh 7wl almwz ghyr sa7i7a?","The correct answer is **A: They are naturally aggressive animals.**

Let's look at why the other options are true, based on the passage:

*   **B: They are sometimes not seen as a potential threat:** The passage says people may approach them too closely because they don't see them as a danger.
*   **C: They can get angry with the presence of people nearby:** The passage explains that if the pronghorn feels threatened, it will defend itself. Getting angry is a natural response to feeling threatened, even if their anger manifests in self-defense.

*   **English Options (translated):**

    *   A: Lacking warm clothing on a cold night.
    *   B: Seeing a mirage that creates the illusion of water.
    *   C: Wasting energy while running after a mirage.
    *   D: Wasting water while running after a mirage.

*   **Analysis:**

    *   The passage states that chasing mirages is dangerous because it wastes energy *and* water.  Hypothermia (from lack of clothing) is also identified as a dangerous risk.
    *   Seeing a mirage itself (option B) is not inherently dangerous. It's the *reaction* to the mirage that creates danger.

*   **Conclusion:**

The least dangerous option is **B: Seeing a mirage that creates the illusion of water.** It's the act of pursuing the mirage (and wasting resources) that is perilous, not the mirage itself."

Analyzing the options:

*   **A: nqs alma' (lack of water/water shortage):** This *is* mentioned, as the text refers to travelers losing their water supply while chasing mirages.

*   **C: تذكرة ذهاب وإياب لإثبات مدة الإقامة (tdkrh dhab weyab lethbat mdh aleqamh)** - The text states: ""يجب أن يكون لديك تذكرة ذهاب و عودة لإثبات طول مدة إقامتك (yajib 2an yakuna ladayka tadhkarat dhahab wa 3awda li-ithbat tul muddat 2iqamatik)"" which translates to: ""You must have a round trip ticket to prove the length of your stay.""

*   **D: بطاقة الإقامة الأمريكية الدائمة (btaqh aleqamh alamrykyh alda'emh)** - The text mentions that Cuban citizens *with* a US green card can visit the Ecuadorian consulate for an *exemption* from the invitation letter requirement. It is not a general requirement for all Cuban citizens.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: رسالة دعوة قانونية (rsalh d'ewh qanwnyh)** since you would need this in order to ensure that all of the other listed requirements are met."

This clearly indicates that luxury frames can be more expensive in a foreign country.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: f7ws al3eyn (Eye exams):** The text suggests the opposite. It recommends getting an eye exam in your home country, especially if insurance covers it, implying it might be more cost-effective.
*   **C: t2amyn alr2ueh (Vision insurance):** The text doesn't directly discuss the cost of vision insurance itself.
*   **D: etarat lyst dat asma2 tjaryh (Frames without brand names):** The text doesn't give us an indication of the cost of non-branded frames."

(It may be impossible to trade and exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so money should be exchanged before leaving the islands.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: tuqbl btaqat ala'etman waljnyh alestrlyny fqt fi aljzr alna'eyh (Only credit cards and the British pound are accepted on remote islands)** The text suggests credit cards are *unlikely* to be accepted on remote islands. It says the British and American currency MAY be accepted, but to confirm with owners.
*   **B: Stanley hy almkan alwhyd aldy syqbl aldwlar alamryky (Stanley is the only place that will accept the US dollar)** The text says US dollars are ""often"" accepted in Stanley, but it doesn't restrict acceptance *only* to Stanley.

(It is likely that credit cards will not be accepted on the outer islands...you should check with the owners beforehand to determine the acceptable payment method).

While the passage mentions other payment options in Stanley and generally in the islands, it specifically highlights the potential difficulty of using credit cards in the outer islands and suggests using British Pounds or US Dollars. Therefore, British Pounds and/or US Dollars (cash) would be particularly useful in the outer islands when credit cards may not be accepted.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   The passage emphasizes adding extra costs for locations *outside* of Africa when comparing prices globally to prices within Africa. It specifically mentions visas, departure taxes, and ground transportation for destinations *outside* Africa.
*   The question asks what you *don't* need to add when comparing the total price offer to Africa versus around the world. The cost of African visas are therefore not needed for the comparison.

Therefore, the other costs (A, B, and D) are all expenses outside of Africa, which must be added in the comparison when flying to Africa versus flying around the world."

*   The passage also mentions that in some countries or types of stores, there is at least one restaurant inside the facility.

So this is not correct.

*   **B: klmat Fransiya ghrybh (A strange French word):** The passage doesn't mention strange or unique words.

*   **C: ntq b3d alklmat al-Fransiya (Pronunciation of some French words):** The passage mentions only *slight* differences in pronunciation. It implies they would likely understand, although there might be a momentary pause to adjust to the variation.

*   **D: m3zm al-Fransiya almhkyh fi Fransa (Most French spoken in France):** The passage indicates that Belgians and Swiss people are familiar with standard French and should understand the majority of it.

**Therefore, here's why I chose ""None of the options are entirely correct"":**

The passage focuses on minor differences in numbering and pronunciation. It states that they *can* understand standard French. None of the options presented are something that would *definitely* cause a lack of understanding. They might experience slight confusion with certain pronunciations, but nothing is listed that would lead to a total breakdown in communication."

*   The passage also notes that pronunciation differences exist (A is incorrect, it says *some* words).
*   Standard French is taught in schools in both Belgium and Switzerland (C is incorrect).

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A:** WestJet *does* offer bereavement fares.

*   The passage states that the phone's GPS app's performance can be limited or unavailable when you don't have a data connection or are out of coverage. A standalone GPS device would still function in these situations, making it more suitable.
*   Option A: Saving money is not really a factor as one might choose to use an app to save money.

The other options are reasons to use GPS apps on smartphones:

Here's why:

The passage describes strategies casinos use to keep guests gambling longer, including:

*   Removing clocks and windows to disorient them from time.
*   Offering special foods, drinks, and entertainment to keep them happy and on the premises.
*   Offering alcohol to impair judgment (although this is also acknowledged as potentially backfiring with skilled gamblers).

The passage doesn't mention anything about manipulating natural light. In fact, the absence of windows implies *lack* of natural light, which aligns with the goal of disorienting guests. Also there are no ""hwafz mthl tdakr alhflat almwsyqyh almjanyh"" in the text.

Translation: ""...alcohol weakens judgment, and all skilled gamblers know the importance of staying alert.""

Now let's look at the options:

*   A: shrb alkthyr mn alkhwl (Drinking too much alcohol) - This directly aligns with the text's statement about alcohol impairing judgment.
*   B: qbwl ay hwafz (Accepting any incentives) - The text mentions the casino offering food, drinks, and entertainment, but it doesn't explicitly advise against accepting them in general, only alcohol consumption is highlighted as a negative.
*   C: tfqd alwqt aw alsa'eat (Losing track of time or the clock) - The text mentions the absence of clocks, but not losing track of time should be avoided.
*   D: alastfsar 3n aqrb mkhrj (Asking about the nearest exit) - The text mentions that it's difficult to find exits, but not asking about them.

Based on this analysis, option A is the most appropriate answer.

**Therefore, the correct answer is A: shrb alkthyr mn alkhwl (Drinking too much alcohol).**"

This translates to: ""This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects. It can also be said that it makes reading easier, while writing is somewhat complicated...""

The passage explicitly says writing is made more complicated by the need to know if a verb or adjective is used nominally in the sentence (requiring capitalization).

*   **A: jswr thljyh (Ice bridges):** Ice bridges *cover* some crevasses, they don't cause them.
*   **C: khwf jlyda mnharh (Collapsed ice caves):** The collapse of ice caves is a separate phenomenon mentioned in the passage, not the direct cause of crevasses.

This translates to: ""Therefore, a backcountry permit for any date starting in May becomes available on January 1st.""

Since August falls *after* May, the permits for August would also become available on January 1st.

Here's why:

* The passage states that permits are required to camp on the edge of the Grand Canyon.
* It also mentions popular areas fill up quickly ""with requests arriving on the first date,"" which emphasizes the ""first-come, first-served"" basis of the permit system.
* **D: 3dd mhdwd mn altsaryh (عدد محدود من التصاريح - limited number of permits)** although true, is not a *policy* but rather a characteristic of the system. The *policy* is how those limited permits are allocated.
* **B: altsaryh mtahh fqt fi 1 ynayr (التصريح متاح فقط في 1 يناير - Permit is only available on January 1st)** This is partially true, but misleading. It only refers to permits for dates *starting* in May. It's not the whole picture.
* **C: la ymkn alhswl 3la altsaryh ela mn khlal tlbat almsharkh (لا يمكن الحصول على التصاريح إلا من خلال طلبات المشاركة - Permits can only be obtained through participation requests)** This is incorrect. It mentions walk-up permits are possible.

*   Old-fashioned style
*   Lack of modern amenities
*   Serving dignitaries and famous guests

Of the answer options, the least likely feature to find in such a hotel would be rooms that have recently been renovated with modern upgrades. The paragraph emphasizes that the old-fashioned style and lack of modern amenities are part of the hotel's character.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: ghrf tm tjdydha m3khraan m3 trqyat hdythh** (rooms that have recently been renovated with modern upgrades)."
"bna'an 3la alm3lwmat almqadamh fi alfa8arh, ay mn al'erwd altalyh sykwn mn ghyr almrjh an y'etyha nzla' alfndq alawlwyh?","Based on the paragraph, the answer is **D: أسعار معقولة للغرف (Reasonable room rates)**.

Here's why:

*   The paragraph explicitly mentions that the traveler considering these hotels is someone ""who has considerable funds for a trip around the world."" This implies that they are not particularly concerned with the lowest price.

The other options are features described in the paragraph as desirable and characteristic of these hotels:

*   A: المفروشات العتيقة في جميع أنحاء العقار (Antique furnishings throughout the property): The paragraph mentions the old-fashioned style as part of the hotel's character.
*   B: مطعم مع طاه ممتاز (Restaurant with an excellent chef): The paragraph mentions delicious food as a feature of these hotels.
*   C: صالة تقدم الترفيه الليلي (A lounge offering nighttime entertainment): The paragraph mentions wonderful evenings of entertainment as a feature of these hotels.

Therefore, reasonable prices would be the least likely priority for guests described in the paragraph."
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma aldy yjb tjnbh mn qbl almsafryn aldyn yzwrwn Greenland?","The correct answer is **D: ""alesharh ela mwatn mn Greenland basm """"Eskimo""""""**.

The passage states: ""3la arraghm min anna kalimat """"Eskimo"""" tadhallu maqbula fi alwilayat al-mutta7ida, illa annaha tu3tabar izdira2an min qibal al-3adid min shu3ub alqutb ashamali ghayr al amrikiya, wa khassatan fi Canada. Fi 7in annaka qad tasma3 al-kalimat allaty yastakhdimuha sukkan Greenland al-asliyin, yajib 3ala al-ajanib tajannub isـtikhdamiha."" This clearly indicates that travelers to Greenland should avoid using the term ""Eskimo"" to refer to the inhabitants.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: b3d almnatq alm3rwfh bartfa3 m3dlat aljrymh:** The passage states: ""Al-jarima wa su2 anniya tijah al-ajanib bi-shaklin 3am ghayr ma3rufin taqriban fi Greenland. 7atta fil mudun, la tujad """"manatiq wa3ira""""."" (Crime and ill-intention towards foreigners are almost unknown in Greenland. Even in cities, there are no ""rough areas"".) So, avoiding high-crime areas isn't something travelers need to worry about in Greenland.
*   **B: jlb almlabs aldaf2eh, 7yth ykwn almnakh daf2eaan bshkl 3am 3la mdar al3am:** The passage states: ""Idha qumta bi ziyarat Greenland khilal al-mawasim al-barida (m3a al-akhdh fil i3tibar annahu kullama itajahta shamalan, sayakunu al-jaw akthar buruda), fa min addarury i7dar malabis dafi2a kafiya."" (If you visit Greenland during the cold seasons (taking into account that the further north you go, the colder it will be), it is necessary to bring enough warm clothes.) This contradicts the statement in option B that the climate is generally warm year-round.
*   **C: twq3 al3eml athna2 wjwdk hnak, 7yth ymkn an ykwn alatsal balentrnt mtqt'eaan:** The passage states: ""Bi fadhl rwabit kablat al-alyaf adhaw2iya al-maghmura bi Europa wal aqmar assina3iya dhat annitaq al3aridh, fa inna Greenland muttasila jayidan bi nisbat 93% min assukkan alladhina ladayhim itisal bil internet."" (Thanks to the submerged fiber optic cable links with Europe and wideband satellites, Greenland is well connected with 93% of the population having internet access.) This indicates good internet connectivity, not intermittent connection."
"wfqaan llfa8arh, mn almrjh an ykwn ay mma yly mshklh llmsafryn ghyr almst'edyn aldyn yzwrwn Greenland?","The passage explicitly states: ""Rubbama yakunu attaqs al-bared howa al-khatar al-7aqiqi al-wa7id alladhy sayuwajihuh ghayr al-musta3idin."" (Perhaps the cold weather is the only real danger that unprepared people will face).

It also mentions mosquitoes: ""Khilal assayf, i7taris aydhan mina al-ba3udh ashamal europy. 3ala arraghm min annahu la yanqul ay amradh, illa 2annahu qad yakunu muz3ijan."" (During the summer, also beware of the northern European mosquito. Although it does not transmit any diseases, it can be annoying).

Based on this, the best answer is:

*   **C: attaqs (The weather)**

While mosquitoes are mentioned, they are described as annoying, not a true danger. The passage explicitly identifies the cold weather as the primary risk for unprepared travelers.
"
ay mma yly ystkhdm alan ksahh mrkzyh?,"The correct answer is **A: hdyqh alathad** (Jardín de la Unión).

The text states that Jardín de la Unión ""ta3malu al-2an ka-sa7a markaziyya"" which translates to ""works now as a central plaza.""
"
"wfqan llfa8arh, ay mma yly ghyr mwjwd fi hdyqh alathad?","The correct answer is **D: mbna dyr qdym (Old monastery building)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions the Jardín de la Unión was built as an atrium for a 17th-century monastery. The only remaining part of that monastery is the Templo de San Diego. Therefore, the original monastery building is no longer existing as a whole, separate structure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: shrfh mrkzyh m3 hflat mwsyqyh (Central gazebo with musical performances):** The passage explicitly states there is a central gazebo in the garden where free musical performances are often held.
*   **B: mnzl qsh hb qdymh (An old love story home):** The Callejon del Beso is mentioned, described as two balconies separated by only 69 cm, and it's the site of an old love legend.
*   **C: mta'em mwajhh llhdyqh (Restaurants facing the garden):** The passage directly says there are several restaurants surrounding the garden."
"bna'an 3la alfa8arh, ay mn aljml altalyh 7wl almshy lmsafat twylh fi alywm t'etbr ghyr dqyqh?","The correct answer is **D: almshy lmsafat twylh lys nshataan fi alhwa' altlq mnasbaan ll'ea3lat alty ldyha atfal (Hiking is not an outdoor activity suitable for families with children).**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that families with young children may need more preparation, but it *doesn't* say it's unsuitable. In fact, it says it's easier to spend a day outdoors even with infants and preschool children.

The other options are supported by the passage:

*   **A: hnak hajh ela alqlyl mn althdyr llmshy lmsafat twylh 3la almsarat alshlh (There is a need for a little preparation for hiking on easy trails)**: The passage says that for a day hike on an easy trail, some preparation is required.
*   **B: tkhtlf almsafat, wlkn mn almftrd an ytm tghtytha fi ghdwn ywm wahd (Distances vary, but should be covered within a day):** The passage states that day hikes cover distances less than a mile to longer distances that can be covered in a day.
*   **C: alashkhas aldyn ytmt'ewn bmstwa m3tdl mn allyaqh albdnyh qadrwn 'emwmaan 3la alastmta'e bhda alnshat (People with a moderate level of fitness are generally able to enjoy this activity):** The passage says that anyone with moderate fitness can enjoy it.

Therefore, D is the statement that is NOT accurate based on the given paragraph.
"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, mta yttlb altnzh alywmy alhd aladna mn althdyr?","The correct answer is **B: 3ndma yntwy 3la msar ashl (When it involves an easier path)**.

The passage states: ""Lil-qiyam bi nuzha li yawm wa7id 3ala tul darbin sahl, yajibu al-qiyam bi-ba3dh al-isti3dadat, wa yumkin li ayi shakhs dhi liyaqa mutawassita al-istimta3 biha."" This translates to: ""To go for a day hike along an easy path, some preparation is necessary, and anyone with moderate fitness can enjoy it.""  This implies that an easier path requires *less* preparation than other types of hikes.
"

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states that in Rogaland and Agder, the plateaus are often referred to as ""hei,"" meaning ""barren moorland,"" and that they are ""ghaliban ma takun mugha6at bil khalnaj"" (often covered in heather).

The other options are incorrect based on the passage:

*   A: **thtwy 3la ashjar**: The passage explicitly says the areas are ""khaliya min al-ashjar"" (barren).
*   B: **la ywjd mdayq**: The passage does not mention any comparison between the presence of ""mdayq"" (straits)
*   C: **alhdab fi alghalb mtsawyh**: The passage does not mention that plateaus are equal compared to rest of Norway."
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ay mma yly ln ykwn nmwdjyaan llnrwyj?","The passage states the following are typical of Norway:

*   Valleys (both glacial and steep)
*   High plateaus referred to as ""vidde"" (wide, open, treeless areas) or ""hei"" (boggy, treeless areas often covered in heather)
*   Steep fjords (inferred from ""valleys of steep descent"")
*   Bogs or marshy areas

Therefore, the only option that is NOT presented as typical for Norway is **B: alhdab almghtah balghabat (Plateaus covered with forests)**. The passage specifically mentions that the plateaus are treeless.

**Final Answer: B**"
mta yjb 3la alsyah almhtmyn baltzlj zyarh mhtat altlal?,"The correct answer is **A: khlal alshta' (خلال الشتاء)** which translates to ""during the winter"".

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that hill stations receive healthy amounts of snow during the winter and offer activities like skiing and ice skating.
* The passage contrasts the peak tourist season (summer) with the unique beauty and activities available in winter.
"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, mta ywjd 'eadh akbr 3dd mn alsyah fi mhtat altlal?","The correct answer is **C: khlal alsyf alhndy (khilal assayf al-Hindi)**.

The passage states: ""Yablugh al-mawsim assiya7i dhurwatahu li ma7attat attilal khilal assayf al-Hindi."" which translates to ""The tourist season reaches its peak for hill stations during the Indian summer.""
"
mada yjb an ttjnb alqyam bh eda knt taml fi al'ethwr 3la qarb ybhth 3n almsa'edh?,"Based on the provided text (P), the best answer is **D: tajahl alzmla' almtnzhyn 3la mtn alqwarb (Ignoring fellow hikers on boats)**.

Here's why:

* **P emphasizes interaction:** The text explicitly instructs you to meet other boaters, share information with them, offer your help, approach people cleaning their yachts, and try to contact sailors on land. The core strategy is networking and communication.
* **D directly contradicts P:** Ignoring fellow boaters would be the *opposite* of what the instructions suggest. You *should* be engaging with them.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: almshy dhabaan weyabaan 3la alarsfh (Walking back and forth on the docks)**: While aimless wandering might not be the *most* efficient approach, it's not directly discouraged in the text, and it *could* potentially lead to interactions.
* **B: msadqh alqbatnh (Befriending the captains)**: While not explicitly mentioned, befriending the captains aligns with the general idea of building rapport and gathering information, which is encouraged.
* **C: ale3lan 3n khdmatk (Advertising your services)**: The text recommends that you offer help, therefore advertising aligns with this recommendation.

Therefore, **D is the action that should be avoided because it directly opposes the advice given in paragraph P.**
"

**A: altwasl m3 albharh** (Communicating with sailors/mariners)

Here's why:

*   P states ""wa tu7awil al itisal bil ba7ara fi al barr"" which translates to ""and try to contact the sailors on land"".

The other options are incorrect because:

*   B: P does not mention staying away from lights.
*   C: P indicates approaching people cleaning boats, but not exclusively.
*   D: P recommends interacting with fellow boaters (mutanazzihin).

Therefore, the emphasis is on communication with sailors and other individuals who might have information about the boat being sought."

The text states, ""Mu3dham amakin attatwir al-7adhary li-jazirat Hong Kong mughattat bi-aradhy mustasla7a 3ala tul ashati2 ashamaly.

This translates to: ""Most of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is covered by reclaimed land along the northern shores. This is where the British colonists took as their special place, so if you are looking for evidence about the colonial past of the region, this is a good place to start your mission.""
"

The passage states: ""ba3da dhalika, ta7tawy ba3dh assuruj wa khassatan assuruj al-ingliziya, 3ala qudhban 2aman tasma7 li-jild arrikab bi-ssuqut mina assirj..."" which translates to ""After that, some saddles, especially English saddles, contain safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to fall off the saddle..."" This directly addresses how the safety bars help mitigate the risk of a rider's foot getting caught in the stirrup.
"

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **C: k'eb** (heel)

The passage highlights the heel and narrow, smooth sole as features of riding shoes that contribute to safety when using stirrups."

Here's why:

The passage clearly states that hospitality exchange networks connect travelers with local residents in the cities they will visit. The passage also states that the main feature of these networks is offering accommodation with local hosts.
"
"bna'an 3la alfa8arh, ay mn aljml altalyh almt'elqh bshbkat tbadl aldyafh ghyr shyh?","The correct answer is **A: ytm tzwyd almsafryn da'emaan bmraj'e llmdyfyn almhlyyn (Travelers are always provided with references for local hosts).**

Here's why:

*   The paragraph states: ""Thumma yatimmu taqdim qa2ima bil-mudhifin al-muta7in 2imma matbu3a wa/aw 3abra al-internet, a7yanan ma3a al-muraji3 wal ta3liqat min qibal al-musafirin al-akharin."" (Then a list of available hosts is provided either in print and/or online, sometimes with reviews and comments from other travelers.) The key word is **a7yanan** (sometimes), implying that references are *not* always provided.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the paragraph:

*   **B: qd tttlb b3d alshbkat thqqaan edafyaan mn almsafryn (Some networks may require additional verification from travelers).** The paragraph states: ""bi-rraghm min 2anna ba3dh ashabakat tuqaddim aw tatatallab ta7qiqan idhafiyan"" (although some networks offer or require additional verification).
*   **C: sytm tzwyd almsafryn bqa'emh balmdyfyn almtahyn fi mdynh alwjhh (Travelers will be provided with a list of available hosts in the destination city).** The paragraph states: ""Thumma yatimmu taqdim qa2ima bil-mudhifin al-muta7in"" (Then a list of available hosts is provided).

Therefore, option A is the only statement that is *not* accurate based on the given paragraph."

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Tu3tabar al-3a2ilat allaty ladayha atfal mashhadan nadiran"" which translates to ""Families with children are considered a rare sight.""

The other options are either explicitly mentioned as common or at least plausible:

*   **A: dyf fi awa'el al'eshrynyat mn al'emr** (A guest in their early twenties): The passage says the ""typical guest"" is in their twenties.
*   **D: dyf fi mntsf althlathynyat mn al'emr** (A guest in their mid-thirties): The passage notes that older travelers are often found there.
*   **B: dyf ysafr bmfrdh** (A guest traveling alone): Although not explicitly mentioned, it's implied as hostels are geared towards individual travelers."
"bna'an 3la alfa8arh, mَn mِn almrjh akthr an yqym fi nzl?","The paragraph (P) states that hostels primarily cater to young people, typically in their twenties. While older travelers are sometimes seen, families with children are a rare sight.

Based on this:

*   **A: zwjan ysafran m3 mwlwd jdyd (A couple traveling with a newborn):** Unlikely, as hostels are generally not family-friendly.
*   **B: thlathh yblghwn mn al'emr 22 3amaan ysafrwn m3aan (Three 22-year-olds traveling together):** This is the *most likely* scenario, as it fits the target demographic of young people in their twenties.
*   **C: zwjan fi alsb'eynyat mn al'emr (A couple in their seventies):** Possible, but less likely than the younger group, as the paragraph mentions older travelers are sometimes seen, but not the primary customer.
*   **D: ea'eltan tsafran m3 atfalhma (Two families traveling with their children):** Highly unlikely, as families with children are described as a rare sight in hostels.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B**.

*   Vaccinations are mentioned in the context of requirements for travelers entering or leaving countries. They are used to *prevent* infectious diseases, not cause them."

* **All the other options are more suited to a VPN:**
    * **A:** Redirecting all internet traffic necessitates a VPN's broader scope.

The other options are true according to the passage:

*   B: ""Tu3id tawjih kul tadaffuq al bayanat 3alal internet, wa laysa faqat brotokol http (it redirects all internet traffic, not just HTTP)."" Implies that proxies do not redirect all internet traffic.
*   C: ""wa judat khidma afdal (and better quality of service)."" Implies web proxies do not have as good of service as VPNs."

(Because calls are directed over the internet, you will not need to use a phone company located in the place where you live or where you are traveling.)

The question asks what allows someone to use a phone company outside their local area. The passage answers that by saying internet-directed calls eliminate the need to use a local phone company.

Here's why:

* The passage mentions that Izmir has a mix of modern elements (wide streets, glass-fronted buildings, modern shopping centers) and traditional ones.
* The passage says ""traditional roofs with red tiles"" are mixed in with the modern architecture.
* The passage mentions ""suq al qaren aththamen 3ashar (the 18th-century market)"" which means things related to the market have been there since pre-modern times (before the modern era).

The other options are clearly modern developments:

The passage states: ""Tu3tabar mushahadat azhar al-karaz, al-ma3rufa bi ism hanami..."" which translates to ""Viewing cherry blossoms, known as hanami...""

Therefore, hanami refers to the viewing of cherry blossoms.

*   The paragraph emphasizes the city's religious significance, historical sites, cultural offerings, and vibrant commercial areas as major tourist draws.
*   The paragraph specifically mentions that most other countries and the United Nations do not recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Therefore, emphasizing this aspect could potentially deter tourists due to the political sensitivity surrounding the issue.

The other options are explicitly mentioned as attractions:

*   Pa Am Oli (bread with olive oil and tomatoes) is a popular and simple dish, and can include cheese, tuna, fish and other available ingredients.

*   Options B and D are also correct in that they will positively affect the stargazing experience however they are not the best answer due to the question requesting for the greatest likelihood or largest number of opportunities.

*   **D: al3mla (Currency):** The text says ""...wa 3umlatiha arrasmiyya,"" which means ""...and its official currency"". This implies that Transnistria has its own currency, different from that used in the rest of Moldova.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: allghh (Language):** While the text mentions that Russian is widely spoken in Moldova, it doesn't explicitly state that language is a differentiating factor between Transnistria and the rest of Moldova.

"wfqaan llfa8arh, mta yjb 3la almsafr zyarh Montevideo eda kan yaml fi tjnb zrwf alryah?","Let's analyze the paragraph and the question.

The paragraph states:

*   Montevideo is in the Southern Hemisphere, so its seasons are opposite to the Northern Hemisphere.
*   Summers are hot (above +30°C).
*   Winters can be deceptively cold due to wind and humidity, even if temperatures rarely drop below freezing.
*   Rainfall is consistent throughout the year (no distinct wet/dry seasons).

The question asks when a traveler should visit Montevideo to avoid windy conditions.  The paragraph specifically mentions that wind contributes to the deceptive coldness of **winter**.

Therefore, to avoid the windy conditions, the traveler should *not* visit during winter in Montevideo. Since the seasons are opposite, winter in Montevideo corresponds to summer in the northern hemisphere. Thus the traveller should visit during summer in Montevideo.

The answer is C: khlal ashhr alsyf fi nsf alkrh alshmaly (during summer months in the northern hemisphere)

**Explanation:**

*   **A: khlal ashhr alshta' fi nsf alkrh alshmaly (during winter months in the northern hemisphere)** This is incorrect, as winter in the northern hemisphere means summer in Montevideo.

*   **B: khlal mwsm aljfaf fi Montevideo (during the dry season in Montevideo)** This is incorrect, as the paragraph says there are no distinct wet/dry seasons.

*   **C: khlal ashhr alsyf fi nsf alkrh alshmaly (during summer months in the northern hemisphere)** This is the correct answer.  Since seasons are opposite, this corresponds to winter in Montevideo, and the paragraph mentions that the winds are prominent during winter making it deceivingly cold.

*   **D: khlal ashhr alshta' fi Montevideo (during winter months in Montevideo)** This is incorrect, as the paragraph associates wind with winter in Montevideo."

This means: ""Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.""
* The question asks when to visit Montevideo for the *coldest* climate.
* Since summer in the Northern Hemisphere corresponds to winter in Montevideo, that is the time to visit for a colder climate.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 3ndma ykwn syfaan fi Montevideo (When it is summer in Montevideo):** This would be the hottest time.

This implies that ""fa3aliyat al-kitaba 3ala al-judran"" is associated with skilled graffiti artists, while the other options are associated with vandalism.

*   The text warns against hanging out in small town bars.

Now, let's look at the options:

*   **A: fi kazynw yb3d sa'etyn 3n Albuquerque (in a casino two hours from Albuquerque):** This is unlikely to be guaranteed, as the text focuses on casinos *around* the city rather than a long distance from it.
*   **B: fi pueblo b'eyd (in a remote pueblo):** The text doesn't mention pueblos as a source of entertainment.

*   **D: fi hanh bldh sghyrh (in a small town pub):** The text explicitly warns against this.

It also states that a variety of local climates, different soils, and different altitudes contribute to the area’s diversity of plants.

The question asks which of the listed trees is LEAST common in the park, according to the paragraph. The paragraph explicitly mentions beech and fir as being particularly abundant. While the passage doesn't *explicitly* say oak (al-balut/blwt) is rare, the focus on beech and fir implies they are the dominant trees. Pine (al-shwh/shuh) is not even mentioned in the passage. Therefore, we can assume that pine is the least common.

* **A: enha drwryh lksb almzyd mn alsytrh 3la alswq (It is necessary to gain more control over the market)**  The passage states that the *real* goal is increased market dominance, making this the truth, not the lie.

* **C: enha mfydh ltdwyr alamwal (It is useful for generating money)** The passage says that at the end of the day its all about making money, making this the truth and not a lie.

* **D: nadraan ma tsa'ed fi mn'e alqrsnh (It rarely helps in preventing piracy)** This option is irrelevant

Therefore, option B is the only option that reflects the lie the passage identifies."
"3nd wswlk ela wtnk, ma hy al'emlyh ghyr alrsmyh 'eadhan?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: fhs alhjrh**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that immigration checks are usually a formality when arriving in your home country: ""Baynama yaghib ijra2 attftish al khas bil hijra 3adatan aw yakun ejra2an shakliyyan 3inda wusuluka ila watanika"".
*   This implies that immigration check is often an ""ghyr alrsmyh"" or informal process upon arrival.

The other options are related to customs, which the passage describes as potentially troublesome. Therefore, the process of ""fhs alhjrh"" is more likely to be non-formal (ghyr alrsmyh) in this context."

Here's why:

* **P:**  The passage focuses on customs control (muraqabat al jamarik) being potentially annoying.  It advises knowing what you can and cannot bring and declaring anything exceeding legal limits.
* **Q:** The question asks what you *should* know before arriving in your country.
* **B:** Directly addresses the main point of the passage: knowing if you need to declare items exceeding limits. This is proactive knowledge that will prevent customs issues.
* **A:** The passage mentions immigration check (tftysh llhjrh) is usually formal, making this option less relevant to the passage's main point.
* **C:** Knowing there's customs control is obvious; the advice is about *how* to handle it.
* **D:** While important, knowing beforehand if something is prohibited is less emphasized in the passage than declaring items over the legal limit.  The passage specifically emphasizes declaring even if it *exceeds* the legal limit.

Therefore, option B is the best answer as it directly addresses the core advice given in the passage."
"wfqaan llfa8arh, fen wfrh mada tsmh llmtslqyn baktshaf trq jdydh bastmrar dakhl wady kwshamw?","The answer is **D: al-judran (الْجُدْرَان)**, which translates to ""the walls"".

The passage states: ""...yunshi2 al-mutasalliqun min jami3 an7a2 al-3alam bi-istimrar turuq jadida bayna qudurat al-judran ghayr al-ma7duda."" This directly translates to: ""...climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes among the unlimited capabilities of the walls.""

Therefore, the abundance that allows climbers to constantly discover new routes is the **walls**.

This means no alliance covers all ocean crossings, SkyTeam covers none, and Star Alliance covers almost everything, with the exception of one route covered by LATAM Oneworld.

Therefore, Star Alliance covers the most ocean crossings in the Southern Hemisphere.

The correct answer is **B: thalf star** (Star Alliance)

The text states: ""La yughatti ay ta7aluf min sharikat attayaran jami3 ma3abir al mu7it aththalatha ( wa la yughatti SkyTeam ayyan min al ma3aber)."" This translates to ""No airline alliance covers all three ocean crossings (and SkyTeam doesn't cover any of the crossings)."" Therefore, SkyTeam covers the least amount of ocean crossings.

While options A, B, and D all relate to safaris, they don't directly address the specific situation of trying to see a shy leopard. Binoculars are the recommended tool for that."

The paragraph states: ""Tamil ba3dh al-7ayawanat, mithil al-fiyala wa zzrafat, ila al-iqtirab min assayarat 3an kathab"" which translates to ""Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach the cars closely.""

The other animals (lions, leopards, cheetahs) are mentioned as being shy and best viewed with binoculars, implying they are less likely to be seen up close.

This translates to: ""Tour prices are cheaper for larger groups, so if you are alone or with only one friend, try to meet other people and form a group of four to six people to get a better price per individual.""

Therefore, finding a group of four (or more, up to six) will result in a lower cost per person for the tour.

Here's why:

*   The paragraph states that prices are cheaper for larger groups.
*   It specifically mentions forming a group of ""arba3 ila sittat ashkhas"" (four to six people) to get a better price.
*   Option D (a group of five) falls within that ideal range.
* The only relevant phrase from the first question, ""takwin majmu3at min arba3 ila sittat ashkhas lil-7usul 3ala si3r afdhal lil-fard,"" means ""forming a group of four to six people to get a better individual price."""

The passage states that San Francisco's economy relies on diverse sources: professional, governmental, financial services, trade, and tourism. It explicitly states that tourism is *one* of the largest employment sectors, but *not* the only one. Therefore, saying it *entirely* depends on tourism is false. The other options (A, B, C) are true according to the paragraph.

"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma hw nw'e almsafr aldy mn ghyr almhtml an ystfyd mn astkhdam khdmat wkyl alsfr?","Let's analyze the provided text and the answer options:

*   **The Text:** The passage discusses the benefits of booking accommodations in advance and how travel agents can help with this. It mentions deals with hotels, booking various types of accommodations, package deals (breakfast, airport transfers, flights), holding bookings, and dealing with visa-related issues. Finally it mentions that the travel agent should be the first point of contact for any requests.

*   **Analyzing the Options:**

    *   **A: A traveler who is not decisive (msafr ghyr hasm):** The passage explicitly mentions that travel agents can ""hold"" a booking while the traveler decides. Therefore, undecided travelers *would* likely benefit from a travel agent. So, this is not the right answer.

    *   **B: A traveler prone to spontaneity (msafr 'erdh ll'efwyh):** Spontaneous travelers are less likely to book things in advance. The core advantage offered by a travel agent (as described in the passage) is pre-arranged accommodations and travel planning. A spontaneous traveler would not typically prioritize these benefits. So, this is a strong contender for the correct answer.

    *   **C: A traveler who has not secured their visa yet (almsafr aldy lm y'emn tashyrth b3d):** The passage specifically mentions that travel agents can help with visa issues. So, such a traveler *would* likely benefit.

    *   **D: A traveler who prefers booking package deals (msafr yfdl hjz sfqat albaqat):** The passage explicitly mentions that travel agents offer package deals. So, this type of traveler *would* benefit.

*   **Conclusion:**

Based on the text, a traveler prone to spontaneity is the least likely to benefit from using a travel agent, because the services they provide are less likely to be needed by that type of traveler.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: msafr 'erdh ll'efwyh**"

*   **B: sfqat alfnadq (Hotel deals):** The passage explicitly mentions that travel agents often have deals with specific hotels.
*   **C: albaqat alshamlh (Inclusive packages):** The passage also mentions that travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even flight and hotel combinations.
*   **D: alahtfaz balhjz (Hold the booking):** The passage states that they can hold the booking if you need time to consider the offer.

Therefore, the only option *not* mentioned as a benefit is expedited travel documents. While the passage mentions needing time to get travel documents (like visas), it does not suggest that the travel agent will expedite them."
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma aldy la ymkn lttbyqat mtrjm alns fi alwqt alf'ely f'elh?","The correct answer is **D: altrjmh alsa7i7a 100% mn alwqt (Translation that is 100% correct all the time)**

The passage explicitly states ""...wa asba7ath tu3ti al yawm tarjamat sa7i7a ila 7addin ma aw aqal (wa nadiran ma takun attarjama rakika) illa annahu yajib ana tatawakhkha al 7adhar li2annah qad takun qad takun asabat al ma3na bi shaklin khata2."" which translates to ""...and now gives correct translations to some extent or less (and rarely the translation is weak), but caution should be exercised because it may have hit the meaning incorrectly.""

This clearly indicates that while translation apps are getting better, they are not always 100% accurate and can sometimes misinterpret the meaning. Options A, B, and C are all capabilities mentioned in the passage.

*   Sometimes the original event is that the sun's rays cause the snow to heat up, sometimes more snowfall, and sometimes other natural or human events.

So, from the information above, options B, C, and D are clearly mentioned as triggers for avalanches.

This leaves option A. The stickiness of the snow *contributes* to the avalanche *potential*, but it's not the trigger itself, according to the text. The stickiness means it *needs* a trigger.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: althlj allzj (The sticky snow)**."

This translates to ""It is not very smart, so the route must take a long detour around the Transantarctic Mountains to reach the plateau."" ""It"" here refers to the route/tractors.

Therefore, the reason for the detour is that the tractors (or the route they follow) are not ""smart"" enough to navigate directly over the mountains.

* The text states: ""Innaha thuluj madghuta ma3a shuquq mamlu2a wa mu3allama bil a3lam"" (It is compressed snow with cracks filled and marked with flags). This directly indicates the cracks filled with snow are marked with flags.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: almsar fi mhth McMurdo (Al-masar fi muheet McMurdo - The path in the vicinity of McMurdo):** While the path starts near McMurdo, the question is about what is specifically marked with flags along the route to the South Pole, not the entire route itself.
*   **B: aljrarat alty tnql alwqwd (Al-jarrarat allati tanqul al-wuqud - Tractors that transport fuel):** While tractors are used to transport fuel and supplies, the text doesn't say they are marked with flags.

Let's look at why the other options are not the *best* answer, even if partially true:

*   **A: qd yttlb alqanwn b3d bnwd altwar'e dakhl alsyarh (The law may require some emergency items in the car)**: While true, this is a logistical detail, not a high-level advisory. It's less important than the broader warning about the instability of neighboring countries.

Here's why:

*   **A: fi b3d albldan, ymkn alhkm 3la aljnah lawl mrh bale'edam** (In some countries, the offender can be sentenced to death for the first offense) - This is mentioned in the passage: ""Tutabbiq ba3dh al-buldan 3uqubat sarima 7atta bi-nnisba lil-ara2im al-murtakaba li-awwal marra; yumkinu 2an tashmal hadhihi al-a7kam bi-ssijn li-akthar min 10 sanawat aw al-2i3dam.""

(This includes waiting in line, as drug-sniffing dogs can be used at any time and without prior warning.)

*   **D: qd tsadr alsltat hqa'ebk, hta lw knt la thml mkhdrat** (The authorities might confiscate your bags, even if you are not carrying drugs) - The passage does not mention that authorities will confiscate your bags even if you don't carry drugs. However, the passage does say that unattended luggage is a target for theft and may attract the attention of the authorities who are concerned about bombs. However, there is no direct statement that the authorities might confiscate your luggage even if you don't carry drugs.

Therefore, option D is the one thing that is *not* explicitly mentioned."

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

This translates to: ""...even more so you can expect limited knowledge - especially among young people."" This directly implies that younger people are more likely to have at least a limited understanding of English.

"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma hw alsynaryw almthaly llmsafr aldy ykhtt lrkwb haflh mn alma7ta aldakhlyh byn almnatq?","Let's analyze each option based on the information in the passage:

*   **A: almsafr almtjh ela Jakar wqd ashtra balf'el tdkrh mn qbl (The traveler heading to Jakar has already purchased a ticket in advance)** - This is the **most ideal** scenario. The passage states that inter-district buses are often full, and it is recommended to buy tickets a few days in advance, especially for destinations like Jakar.

*   **B: almsafr almtjh ela Bumthang wyhtaj ela almghadrh bhlwl 7 (The traveler heading to Bumthang needs to leave by 7)** - The passage mentions buses to eastern locations and Jakar/Bumthang leave between 6:30 and 7:30. Leaving by 7 is within that window, but not ideal since tickets might not be available.

*   **C: almsafr almtjh ela Paro wyhtaj ela almghadrh b3d 11 (The traveler heading to Paro needs to leave after 11)** - While a shared taxi to Paro is an option (and potentially more comfortable), the passage doesn't indicate that buses to Paro don't exist, only that shared taxis are convenient. It doesn't suggest that this traveler should wait until after 11.

*   **D: almsafr almtjh shrqaan wysl ela alma7ta qbl alsa3a 6:20 (The traveler heading east arrives at the station before 6:20)** - The passage states buses to the east leave between 6:30 and 7:30. Arriving before 6:20 is a good idea, it doesn't guarantee that the traveller will catch the bus as priority is given to passengers with tickets already bought.

**Therefore, the correct answer is A: almsafr almtjh ela Jakar wqd ashtra balf'el tdkrh mn qbl**"
ma hy alnsyhh aljydh llsa'eh aldy yttl'e ela alsfr shrqaan mn alma7ta aldakhlyh byn almnatq?,"The correct answer is **B: Shira2 tdkrh msbqh (shira' tadhkira qabla ayam qalila)** which means ""Buy a ticket in advance"" or ""Purchase a ticket a few days before"".

Here's why:

*   The text specifically says: ""Nadharan li 2anna al-7afilat bayna al-manatiq ghaliban ma takunu mumtali2a, fa min al-musta7san shira2 tadhkira qabla ayam qalila."" This translates to ""Because inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: alhaflat tghadr fqt b3d alsa3a 8:30** (The buses only leave after 8:30): This is incorrect. The text mentions most buses headed east leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
*   **C: tghadr al'edyd mn alhaflat twal alywm** (Many buses leave throughout the day): While buses leave throughout the day, the text focuses on the limited availability of buses going east during the morning hours and the necessity of booking in advance.
*   **D: qd tkwn syarh alajrh almshtrkh adka wsylh llsfr** (A shared taxi may be a smarter way to travel): While shared taxis are mentioned, they are specifically for nearby places like Paro and Punakha, and the question asks about traveling eastward in general. So, while valid in certain situations, it's not the best general advice for the scenario."
ay mma yly lys wsfaan dqyqaan le Timbuktu?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is:

**C: la ymkn alwswl elyha balta'erh (It cannot be reached by plane)**

Here's why:

*   **A: ldyha tathyr 'erby akthr mn bqyh alblad (It has more Arabic influence than the rest of the country)** - The passage explicitly states: ""Al-madina fi tanaqud sarikh ma3a baqiyat mudun al-bilad, li-annaha tatamayaz bi-tabi3 3araby akthar min kawniha ifriqiya."" (The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country, because it is characterized by a more Arab nature than it is African).
*   **B: enha t'eany mn alfqr (It suffers from poverty)** - The passage explicitly states: ""Tu3addu Timbuktu alyawm madina faqira"" (Timbuktu is today a poor city).
*   **D: la tzal 3aml jdb llsyah alfdwlyyn (It is still an attraction for curious tourists)** - The passage says: ""Tu3addu Timbuktu alyawm madina faqira, wa dhalika 3ala arraghm min 2anna sum3atiha taj3aluha mantiqat jadhb siya7y"" (Timbuktu is today a poor city, despite the fact that its reputation makes it a tourist attraction).

The passage **does not mention anything about Timbuktu being inaccessible by plane.** It only mentions that it was relatively inaccessible in the past, which is why it became a metaphor for faraway and exotic lands.

"
ay mn alhqa'eq altalyh 3n Timbuktu shyh?,"Let's analyze the provided text (P) and the questions (Q) and answer choices (A, B, C, D):

**Understanding the Text (P):**

*   Timbuktu, due to its relative inaccessibility, is a metaphor for remote and exotic lands.
*   Today, Timbuktu is a poor city.
*   Its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
*   It was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger in 1990 due to the threat of desert sands.
*   It was a major stop in Henry Louis Gates's ""African World Wonders"" PBS program.
*   The city is markedly different from other cities in the country, with a more Arab character than African.

**Analyzing the Question (Q):**

The question asks which of the following statements is true about Timbuktu based on the text.

**Evaluating the Answer Choices:**

*   **A: ymkn alwswl ela almdynh balta'erh (Can be accessed by plane)** - The text explicitly states there is an airport (""kama yujad biha matar"").  So, this is TRUE.

*   **B: hy ghrybh akthr mn kwnha fqyrh (It is more exotic than it is poor)** - The text states that it *is* a poor city, though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction. It is described as both, but emphasis is placed on it being a poor city, so this is not true

*   **C: lha tab'e afryqy aql mn almdn almhyth (It has less of an African character than the surrounding cities)** - The text states the *opposite*: ""Al-madina fi tanaqud sarikh ma3a baqiyat mudun al-bilad, li-annaha tatamayaz bi-tabi3 3araby akthar min kawniha ifriqiya"" (The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, because it is characterized by a more Arab than African character). So, this is TRUE based on the provided text.

*   **D: lm t'ed almdynh tjdb alsyah (The city no longer attracts tourism)** - The text states ""sum3atiha taj3aluha mantiqat jadhb siya7y"" (Its reputation makes it a tourist attraction). So, this is FALSE.

**Conclusion**

Since question asks for true answers, both A and C are true.

"wfqaan llfa8arh, fi ay nqth ysbh ale3sar alqm3y e3saraan?","The correct answer is **D: b3d mlamsh alard (after touching the ground)**.

The passage states: ""Tabda2 ka mamarrat tahbut min al ghuyum al 3asifa, thumma tusbi7 """"a3asir"""" 3inda lamsiha lil ared (It starts as a passage descending from the storm clouds, then becomes a 'tornado' when it touches the ground).""
"
ay mn hdh hy khasyh dqyqh lle3sar?,"Let's analyze the provided text (P) and the answer options (A-D) to identify the most accurate characteristic of the described phenomenon:

*   **P (Translation):** ""On the left is a rotating column of extremely low-pressure air that sucks surrounding air inward and upward. It generates strong winds (sometimes 100-200 miles per hour) and can lift things into the air and carry them along. It starts as a passage descending from storm clouds, then becomes a ""tornado"" when it touches the ground.""

Now let's evaluate the options:

*   **A: It always generates winds at a speed of about 100-200 miles per hour.** The original text says the winds are sometimes in that range. ""Sometimes"" is not ""always."" This is incorrect.

*   **B: It usually moves heavy objects.** The text says it can lift things into the air and carry them along. Moving heavy objects is a direct consequence. This is a reasonable inference.

*   **C: It becomes a funnel tornado after touching the ground.** The text states it becomes a ""tornado"" (e3sar) when it touches the ground. This aligns well with the description.

*   **D: It rotates columns of air pushing the air out.** The text says it *sucks* air inward and upward, not pushing it outward. This is incorrect.

**Conclusion:**

Option C is the most direct and accurate reflection of the information given in the description. B is potentially accurate, but it's an inference rather than a stated fact. C is a direct statement made in the text.

**Therefore, the correct answer is C.**"

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Qad targhab aydhan fi rruju3 ila mashurat 7ukumat bi-khilaf 7ukumatik, illa 2anna mashurataha qad wudhi3at li-muwatiniha."" which means, ""You may also want to refer to the advice of a government other than your own, but its advice is provided to its citizens"".
*   This implies that advice from their own government would be more appropriate, which matches option D.
*   Other options are wrong because:
    *   A: Although the passage mentions that the country that you will visit is under travel recommendations, it did not directly mention that you can get advice about the political situation from the government of the country you're visiting.
    *   B: It is not recommended to get information from travel consultation, as the passage states, ""Ghaliban ma takun al-ara2 al-muqaddama sat7iya, wa 3amma, wa mubassata bi-shaklin mubalagh fih, muqaranatan bil ma3lumat al-akthar tafsilan allty tatawaffar fi amakin 2ukhra"", which means that travel consultation is superficial and generalized, which is an exaggeration compared to other detailed information.
    *   C: Although the passage states that a traveller would get different advice from citizens of a country that you are visiting, it did not imply that the traveller can get the advice regarding political situation from the citizens.

**Therefore, the best answer is D.**"
"fi halh wjwd astsharat sfr, ma aldy mn ghyr almrjh an ykhtbrh almwatn alajnby?","The passage states:

*   Travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected if the country you are visiting is subject to travel advisories.
*   Consultations are just a brief summary of the political situation in one country.
*   The opinions provided are often superficial, general, and overly simplistic, compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.

Therefore, detailed information on the political situation is *less* likely to be experienced based on the passage.

The correct answer is **D: m3lwmat mfslh 3n alhalh alsyasyh fi albld** (detailed information on the political situation in the country).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that travel agents are a good choice for trips that exceed the traveler's previous experiences in terms of nature, culture, language, or low-income countries. A work trip to a city the traveler has already been to is unlikely to present any of these challenges. The paragraph emphasizes that travel agents are most useful when the trip involves unfamiliar cultural, linguistic, or logistical complexities.
*   Options B, C, and D all imply complexities that a travel agent could help with. B mentions a limited budget, which requires careful planning. C involves a language barrier. D represents a completely new experience (traveling abroad for the first time)."

**B: 3ndma ykwn almsafr mhtmaan bhjz rhlh mtkhssh lawl mrh** (When the traveler is interested in booking a specialized trip for the first time)

Here's why:

*   The passage states that a travel agent is a good choice for trips that exceed the traveler's previous experience in terms of nature, culture, language, or low-income countries. Booking a specialized trip for the first time would almost certainly fall into this category. The other options don't necessarily imply a lack of experience or expertise from the traveler's side."
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma aldy ymkn an ysa'ed almsafr 3la tjnb khybh alaml athna' zyarh amakn jdydh?","The correct answer is **B: alrghbh fi tjrbh alat'emh ghyr almalwfh (الرغبة في تجربة الأطعمة غير المألوفة)**.  While the text doesn't *specifically* say ""try new foods,"" it emphasizes the importance of acknowledging and accepting differences in customs, food, laws, language, etc.  Being open to trying new foods is a specific example of this general principle, and therefore helps avoid disappointment.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: twq'e m3ayyr mmathlh lmkan wjwdh (توقع معايير مماثلة لمكان وجوده):** The passage explicitly states NOT to expect things to be the same as at home. This is the opposite of what the passage recommends.
*   **C: alaltzam bnfs alqwanyn almwjwdh fi almkan aldy yatwn mnh (الالتزام بنفس القوانين الموجودة في المكان الذي يأتون منه):** The passage mentions that laws are different, so adhering to your home country's laws would be inappropriate and potentially problematic.
*   **D: tjnb albhth almsbq 3n alskn (تجنب البحث المسبق عن السكن):** The text doesn't directly speak to the importance of seeking housing. Although, it doesn't dissuade one to not seek out accommodation arrangements either.

Therefore, option **B** is the most logical answer based on the provided text."
"bna'an 3la alm3lwmat almwjwdh fi alfa8arh, ay nw'e mn alashkhas qd y'eany mn khybh alaml 3nd alsfr ela mkan ajnby?","Based on the paragraph, the correct answer is:

Here's why:

*   The paragraph emphasizes that things will be different in a foreign place, including customs, rules, food, traffic, housing, standards, language, etc.
*   It warns that you shouldn't expect things to be ""like they are in your country.""
*   It says this consideration is important ""to avoid disappointment or perhaps even aversion to the local customs followed for doing things.""

A close-minded person is more likely to be resistant to these differences and therefore experience disappointment or aversion. Someone who embraces change (B), enjoys learning (D), or even likes strange food (A) would be less likely to have these negative reactions."

Here's why:

*   The text advises against sleeping on the ground in unfamiliar areas due to local animals. This implies a need to be aware of the potential dangers before doing so.
*   Option C is directly mentioned, and Option D is advised.

Therefore, A aligns most directly with the advice given in the passage.

The text mentions bringing a camping bed or hammock for camping to avoid snakes and scorpions, but it doesn't suggest ""splurging"" on a camping bed or mattress.

*   **A: E'eta' nskhh ela rfyq alsfr (Giving a copy to a travel companion):** This relies on the travel companion having the copy available and accessible when needed. It's not ideal if the traveler needs the information independently.

*   **B: Ersal nskhh balbryd alelktrwny ela nfsh (Sending a copy by email to himself):** This requires internet access to retrieve the email.

*   **C: Alahtfaz bnskhh mkhznh fi dakrh alkmbywtr almhmwl (Keeping a copy stored in the laptop's memory):** This allows the traveler to access the file directly from their laptop (or tablet) without needing an internet connection.

The original passage explicitly recommends this option: ""Idha kunta tusafir ma3a jihaz computer ma7mul aw jihaz law7y, fa qum bi-takhzin nuskha fi dhakiratih aw qursih (yumkinu al-wusul ilayha bidun internet).""

The paragraph does NOT mention the email address of the policyholder.

The paragraph states that the 35mm format (36 x 24 mm) is the most common. Therefore, the negative corresponding to the most common film format would be 35mm. Although the specific dimensions 36x24mm are given, the broader term ""35mm"" encompasses this.
"

Here's why:

* The paragraph states ""Tu3addu takalif ziyarat madinat Whistler bahidha"" which translates to ""The costs of visiting the city of Whistler are high"". This directly indicates that Whistler is the least attractive option for budget-conscious travelers.
* The other options are presented as more accessible and appealing:
    * Jazirat Bowen (Bowen Island) is described as a popular day trip or weekend getaway, suggesting it's a more affordable and easily accessible option.
    * Jazirat Granville (Granville Island) is mentioned as the departure point for the water taxi to Bowen Island, implying it's a starting point for exploration rather than a costly destination itself.
    * Sea to Sky Corridor is recommended for outdoor activities, but there's no mention of high costs associated with it.

"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma hy alwjhh alty mn almrjh an tqadam llmsafryn tjrbh Vancouver alaslyh?","The correct answer is **A: Jazirat Bowen (Bowen Island)**.

The passage explicitly states that Bowen Island is a popular day trip or weekend getaway. While Whistler is mentioned, it's noted as being expensive. Granville Island is simply mentioned as the departure point for ferries to Bowen Island and downtown Vancouver is the departure point for the ferry to Bowen Island. The original Vancouver experience is most closely tied to what Bowen Island offers.

Here's why:

* The paragraph states that during the rainy season (November to March), the waterfall becomes more powerful, but the increased water volume obscures the view of the actual falls.
* The question asks when travelers should visit if they want unobstructed views.
* Therefore, the best time to visit for unobstructed views is *outside* the rainy season."

(In the rainy season (starting from November to March), the water volume will rise and the waterfalls will be more intense and violent.)
    The passage highlights the increase in water volume during that period, leading to more intense and violent waterfalls. This equates to a more dramatic and powerful view.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: mshahdh alshlalat dwn ay e'eaqh** (Viewing the waterfalls without any obstacles): The text says that the view of the actual waterfalls would be hidden by water due to the increased volume of water, thus making this option incorrect.
*   **B: syah aql** (Fewer tourists): The passage doesn't indicate fewer tourists during the rainy season.
*   **D: tjnb mwsm alamtar** (Avoiding the rainy season): Visiting between November and March means experiencing the rainy season, not avoiding it."

*   The passage emphasizes checking permissions and licenses before flying a drone. It also states that flying near crowds or airports is a bad idea. Option D is the only one that reflects the passage's advice on obtaining proper authorization before flying."

Here's why:

*   The passage states that volunteering can help increase a budget because many positions offer housing, meals, and sometimes small stipends. It **does not** imply that volunteering is a way to earn a substantial salary.
*   The other options align with the benefits described in the passage: making new friends, learning new skills, and having accommodation and food provided."

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...nadharan ila anna al 3adid min al waza2if attatawwu3iyya tuwaffir sakan wa wajbat ta3am..."" which means ""because many volunteer jobs offer accommodation and meals..."". This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ytm twfyr alratb tqrybaan da'emaan (ytm twfyr alratb tqrybaan da'emaan)**: This translates to ""Salary is almost always provided"". The passage says ""3adad qalil mnihum yadfa3una rawatib qalila"", meaning ""a small number of them pay small salaries"".  This contradicts the statement that salary is *almost always* provided.
* **B: eadh ma y'edy ela frs 'eml (eadh ma y'edy ela frs 'eml):** This translates to ""It may lead to work opportunities"". The passage doesn't directly discuss future employment opportunities as the primary benefit of volunteering for someone on a budget.
* **D: ymkn an ysa'edk fi aktsab alsh'ewr balmnzwr (ymkn an ysa'edk fi aktsab alsh'ewr balmnzwr):** This translates to ""It can help you gain a sense of perspective"". While the passage does mention gaining perspective as a benefit of volunteering, it is not directly related to the benefits for someone with a limited budget.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.

*   Spending about a week without leaving Disney property.

Therefore, staying at a hotel off-site is **not** typical.

The correct answer is **B: aleqamh fi fndq kharj almwq'e** (Staying in a hotel off-site).

* The other options, while related to the overall topic, are not as directly mentioned as being specifically covered in the training course:
    *   مناطق الحرب (Manatiq al-Harb) - War Zones: This is the overall context, but not a specific topic in the training.
    *   البقاء على قيد الحياة في البرية (Al-Baqa' Ala Qayd Al-Hayah Fi Al-Bariyah) - Wilderness Survival: The passage contrasts this with war zone survival.
    *   البيئات العدائية (Al-Bi'at Al-'Eda'eyyah) - Hostile Environments: This is a general term, but ""first aid"" is a concrete skill taught in the training."

*   **The passage says:** ""...if you are concerned, you should consider buying water in hermetically sealed bottles from a reputable company."" This is a direct recommendation to purchase bottled water when worried about contamination.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: an yughla alma' l'edh dqa'eq (Boiling water for several minutes):** The passage states that the duration needed for boiling water varies from one minute to several minutes, implying that it might not always be effective in all locations.
*   **C: an yughla alma' lmdh dqyqh wahdh (Boiling water for one minute):** This is also variable based on location and potential contaminants.
*   **D: tqyym almyah llthdydat almhddh (Assessing water for specific threats):** While important, the passage does not directly state that this is a way to *avoid* potentially contaminated water. You need to assess and *then* choose a method of purification or an alternative source. Also this option assumes you have the means of evaluating, which is not always readily available."

Here's why:

*   The passage clearly states that swimming against the current leads to exhaustion and is often impossible.
*   The passage suggests that once you are out of the current, swimming back to shore is not more difficult than normal.

Therefore, the best strategy is to escape the current by swimming in a direction perpendicular to it, and then swim back to shore."

"wfqaan llfa8arh, ay mma yly ln ykwn nsyhh mwsa bha llnsa' almsafrat fi almntqh?","Based on the provided text, here's the analysis of each option:

*   **A: alamtna'e 3n mnaqshh alwd'e al'ea'ely (Abstaining from discussing marital status):** The text explicitly advises women to *say* they are married, regardless of their actual marital status. This is the *opposite* of abstaining from discussing it.
*   **B: aldrayh ban alakhtlafat althqafyh qd thrd 3la slwk qwy mn alskan almhlyyn (Being aware that cultural differences may lead to aggressive behavior from local people):** The text directly states that cultural differences can lead to what women might consider harassment, so this is good advice.
*   **C: tjnb artda' almjwhrat albraqh (Avoid wearing flashy jewelry):** The text advises wearing a ring, but not one that looks expensive. This implies avoiding flashy or expensive jewelry.
*   **D: astkhdm alqwh 3nd aldrwrh (Use force when necessary):** The text encourages firmness in refusing men and defending one's position. While it doesn't explicitly say ""use force,"" the idea of standing up for yourself when necessary aligns with this.

**Therefore, the answer is A: alamtna'e 3n mnaqshh alwd'e al'ea'ely (Abstaining from discussing marital status)**. The text explicitly advises women to state they are married."

Here's why:

*   The original passage explicitly advises women to be firm in rejecting men and not to be afraid to defend their position, regardless of cultural differences. This aligns directly with option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: edrak anh mn ghyr almalwf atba'eha** (إدراك أنه من غير المألوف اتباعها) which translates to ""Realizing that it is unusual to follow them"" - This is the opposite of the text, which suggests women *will* be followed or approached.
*   **B: artda' khatm kbyr lldlalh 3la alhalh al'ea'elyh** (ارتداء خاتم كبير للدلالة على الحالة العائلية) which translates to ""Wearing a large ring to indicate marital status"" - The text advises wearing a ring that *doesn't* appear expensive and suggests indicating marriage regardless of actual status. A large, showy ring would contradict that.
*   **C: fhm an alakhtlafat althqafyh tshyr ela ank ttjnb altmsk bmwqfk** (فهم أن الاختلافات الثقافية تشير إلى أنك تتجنب التمسك بموقفك) which translates to ""Understanding that cultural differences mean you should avoid sticking to your position"" - The passage clearly states that cultural differences don't excuse inappropriate behavior and that women should defend their position.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate and helpful piece of advice based on the provided text."

( ...although things like a flock of birds or a small creature require other lenses)."" This directly indicates that small creatures necessitate a different, specialized lens.

*   Finding rare animals.
*   Dealing with aggressive animals.
*   Working in harsh environments.

The paragraph also states that wildlife photography often requires a long lens, which implies needing to acquire the right equipment, like the lenses.

Therefore, all the options are mentioned in the paragraph. The question is ""which of the following is **not** mentioned?"" Since they are all mentioned, then something is wrong.

However, if the question were to ask ""which of the following presents the greatest challenge?"", then the answer would be more difficult, because all of the options are presented as obstacles to some degree.

**But, going with what is directly stated within the text, here's a breakdown of the answer**:

*   **A: al'ethwr 3la hywanat ghrybh mu'eynh** (Finding certain exotic animals) - Directly mentioned: ""Yas3ub al-3uthur 3ala al-3adid min al-7aywanat al-ghariba"" (It is difficult to find many rare animals).

*   **C: alhswl 3la nw'e al'edsat almtlwbh** (Obtaining the required type of lenses) - Implied: ""Ytatallab taswir al-7ayah al-barriya 3adasa tawila fil aghlab"" (Wildlife photography often requires a long lens), and the mention that other creatures require other lenses. This means acquiring the right lenses can be a challenge.
*   **D: al'eml fi by'eat m3adyh mhtmlh** (Working in potentially hostile environments) - Directly mentioned: ""Qad takun al-bi2a barida, aw 7arra, aw ghayr mula2ima bi-ayi shakl 2akhar"" (The environment may be cold, or hot, or unsuitable in any other way).

Given that the prompt is asking to select what is **not** a potential challenge, there is something wrong with the prompt itself.

*   **The text focuses on hazards directly related to snow, ice, and cold weather:**

    *   Tasaqut athuluj aw al-jalid aw darajat al-7arara almutajamida (Snowfall, ice, or freezing temperatures)
    *   Al-i7tikak munkhafidan (Low friction - due to ice/snow)

    *   Taqyid arru2ya (Restricted visibility - due to snow, ice, condensation)

*   **Why the other options are problematic:**

    *   **B: alahtkak almnkhfd (Low friction):** The text explicitly states that low friction on icy/snowy roads makes driving very difficult and dangerous.
    *   **C: emlyh altkthf almfrth (Excessive condensation):** Condensation, as mentioned in the context of ice on windows, restricts visibility, which is a major hazard.
    *   **D: ankhfad alr'eyh (Reduced visibility):** The text directly mentions that falling snow/ice or condensation/ice on windows restricts visibility. This is a major problem for drivers.

*   **Why dense traffic is the *least* problematic (relatively):**

    *   While dense traffic is generally a nuisance and can be dangerous in any situation, the text focuses primarily on the unique challenges posed by winter weather conditions. In some winter weather situations, it might even slow people down and lower the risk of accidents (though this isn't a good thing).

**Therefore, the answer is A: hrkh almrwr alkthyfh (Dense traffic).** It's the *least* problematic compared to the hazards specifically emphasized in the text about driving in snowy/icy mountain passes."

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the *differences* in income tax across countries.**  It highlights variations in rates, brackets, and even the level at which taxes are levied (federal vs. local).  Therefore, we are looking for something that is *least* likely to vary.

* **A: alm3dlat (The rates):** The passage explicitly says that tax rates vary significantly.

* **B: alhyklyh (The structure):** The passage mentions federal systems versus other types, implying the structure of income tax systems differs.

* **D: alshira2eh (The brackets):** The passage directly states that tax brackets vary considerably.

* **C: mkan altqdym (The place of filing):** Although the details surrounding *how* and *when* to file might vary, the basic principle that you file taxes *in the country where you reside and earn income* is likely to be relatively constant across different countries. While the *exact process* of filing might differ, the *place* where you are required to file (typically, the country where you live and work) is more likely to remain consistent than the other options.

Therefore, the location of filing (the country where you are working) is the most stable aspect of income tax across different countries compared to the rates, brackets, and structure of the tax system itself.

It describes the World Expo as having artistic and educational displays in national pavilions to showcase global issues or a country's culture and history.

"
alqyam bay mma yly syqll mn ahtmalyh wqw'e hjwm hywan?,"Let's analyze each option based on the provided text (translated below for clarity):

*Translation of the text:*

P: Despite the fact that many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, their lives should remain wild, and these animals should not be fed or disturbed. According to the park authorities, stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from all other wildlife! Regardless of their obedience, bison, deer, American gazelle, bears, and almost all large animals can attack. Every year, dozens of visitors are injured due to a lack of sufficient distance between them. These animals are large, wild, and likely to be dangerous, so give them their space. In addition, you should realize that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strongly scented foods and keep the camp clean.

*Analyzing the options:*

*   **A: hml ala'eshab al'etryh (Carrying aromatic herbs/scents):**  The passage states that strong odors attract animals (specifically mentioning bears). Aromatic herbs/scents would fall into this category. Thus, carrying them increases the likelihood of an animal encounter and potential attack. This makes this a likely cause of a potential animal attack.
*   **B: ezalh alqmamh mn mwq'e almkhym (Removing garbage from the campsite):** The passage advises keeping the camp clean, implying that garbage attracts animals. Removing garbage would *decrease* the likelihood of an attack. This is a good practice, not a cause for attack.
*   **C: alhfaz 3la msafh 25 yardh mn ald'eab (Maintaining a distance of 25 yards from wolves):** The passage clearly states to stay at least 100 meters from bears and wolves. 25 yards is equal to approximately 23 meters, which is less than the recommended distance from wolves (100 meters). Therefore, maintaining a 25-yard distance is too short and increases the possibility of an attack. This makes this a likely cause of a potential animal attack.
*   **D: rd'e al7ywanat bfdlat alt3am (Feeding animals with leftover food):** The passage explicitly states that the animals should not be fed. Feeding them encourages them to approach humans and can provoke aggression. This makes this a likely cause of a potential animal attack.

Therefore, A, C, and D are all possible reasons to get attacked by an animal, but the questions state to pick ONE answer. Out of all of these options, carrying aromatic herbs would be the least likely to provoke an animal to attack (as opposed to intentionally getting close to them, or feeding them).

Therefore the best answer is:

**A: hml ala'eshab al'etryh**"
ay mma yly lm ydkr fi alfa8arh ksbb mhtml lhjmat alhyah albryh?,"The correct answer is **D: al7ywanat ghyr almtalfh m3 albshr (Animals unfamiliar with humans)**.

Here's why:

*   **A: alrwa'eh alqwyh (Strong smells):** The passage explicitly states that strong smells attract bears and other wildlife, making it a potential cause of attacks.
*   **B: edm alhfaz 3la almsafh (Not keeping a distance):** The passage emphasizes the importance of maintaining a safe distance from animals, and it mentions that many visitors are injured because they don't keep a sufficient distance.
*   **C: et3am alhyah albryh (Feeding wildlife):** The passage warns against feeding wildlife.

The passage doesn't say that the animals are not familiar with humans, but they must be wild, and keeping the distance is necessary, even though they may be familiar with the sight of humans.
