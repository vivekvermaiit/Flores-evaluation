"Daga bindoul, dume hosatake fotitidoum ha fijirde accordion?","Based on the text provided (P), the correct answer is **A: Ngam beddari sautu beddu sambi je a biddirta keys**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes how to play the accordion. It mentions using the bellows (bellows) with strength to get the piano sound (a soman mere. Numtu wala bote a fiya majun be sembe ngam na bana piano ɗon fi'e.). It also states that to get more sound, one uses the bellows (Do accordion, to a yiɗi holo ɓedda, a naftira be bellows be sembe ko be lau lau.).

The options given are:
*  **A:** In order to increase the sound made by the keys it pushes.
*  **B:** Dayu ngamhi ngam a usta lutta sembe ma (meaningless).
*  **C:** Hakkilan fiyugo bindi toadan hakkilini jangu suitigo (meaningless).
*  **D:** Beddu jawal gala noddirta ngam aheba sautu ɓurgu (meaningless).

Thus, the answer must be A."
"To tom don fija accordion, toi der tokkidi dou wakititta beddugu sautu?","The passage (P) describes how to play the accordion. It states that if you want the sound to be louder, you should use the bellows with more strength, either quickly or slowly.

The question (Q) asks: When someone plays the accordion, what do they do to increase the volume?

Based on the passage, the correct answer is:

*   **B: Bedda sembe (Increase strength)**

The passage explicitly states that increasing the force applied to the bellows increases the volume. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
"
Ko wadi suraji telebijin don mari ragare kerol?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngam suraji man hebbina screen** (Because the images fill the screen).

The passage explains that TVs crop the edges of the image (and often the top and bottom as well) so that the picture fills the entire screen. This is done so that the image extends to all edges of the screen, without any black bars on any of the edges.
"
"Daga bindoul, toi der tokkidi shaddi dou goddo to filita moure hora DVD yake?","The correct answer is **C: Suraje hebbini screen pat** (The image fills the entire screen).

Here's why:

* **The Passage Explains:** The passage states that when watching DVDs, the borders are removed (borders mai ta’an itta), meaning the image fills the entire screen. It also mentions that subtitles, even if they are at the bottom, will be visible. This directly supports option C.

* **Why the Other Options Are Incorrect:**

    * **A: suraje hebbinai screen manfat:** While related, it's not as direct. The passage focuses on filling the screen, not necessarily improving or increasing it.
    * **B: Ta'a sedda subtitles:** The passage explicitly says subtitles are visible when borders are removed.
    * **D: Ta'a Kerol:** This translates to ""Cut the edges."" The text explicitly refutes this notion. The point of the text is that playing a DVD fills the screen, removing the black bars which cut off portions of the picture.

Therefore, **C** is the most accurate and complete answer based on the information in the provided passage.
"
Hatoi notta british runduna hedi?,"The correct answer is **C: Bordertown**.

The passage states that General John Cadwalder began investigating the attack on the British garrison at Bordentown.
"
Watugo jungo moi wangi nou bindouldraf?,"The correct answer is **A: John Dunlap**.

The passage states that the declaration was printed ""ha dow pellel printin je Jon Dunlap"" (on the printing press of John Dunlap).
"
Der dey babe haloi Dunlap broadside jippi ragare?,"The correct answer is **C: Landan (London)**.

The passage states: ""London hebi iri mai ha august 10"" which translates to ""London received a copy of it on August 10th.""
"
Deldoi toi Colonel Stark konobetted?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: Ha yeso mahol**.

The passage states: ""timmunungo Gridley ko Stark wadi shaida feet 100 be (30 m) ha yeso mahol mai bo ohokki doka ta komoi fiɗa har sai ta regulars saali ɗum.""

This translates to ""Gridley and Stark measured 100 feet (30 m) in front of the wall and gave the order that no one should fire until the regulars passed it.""
"
"Bana doum holliri ha bindoul, de himbe stark deddi townugo mahol maɓɓe?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is:

**B: Bawo regulas sari tiggere**

The passage states: ""Gridley ko Stark wadi shaida feet 100 be (30 m) ha yeso mahol mai bo ohokki doka ta komoi fiɗa har sai ta regulars saali ɗum.""

This translates to: ""Gridley or Stark made sure it was 100 feet (30m) in front of the fort, but then ordered not to shoot till the regulars passed it.""
"
"daga bindoul, diƴeder tokkidi woni gitel ɗer leddisin ɓourɗum khadaru?","Based on the provided text (P), the era being discussed is characterized by conflict between major figures vying for power. The text mentions this period as being after the ""three kingdoms"" era, a turbulent time in Chinese history. The text also references Xi'an as a place where many died fighting for power.

Therefore, the best answer is:

*   **D: Hitade lamuɗe tati** (Era of the Three Kingdoms)

The passage specifically refers to the aftermath of the ""wuro taati epoch"", which translates to ""three kingdoms era"" in the question.
"
"Daga bindoul, dume gonga kondorle natata nomadic hali sa'e?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is:

**C: Be sanyi sabɓo je be firlititta bawoba ide 17**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Kala vonne-vonne eggu'egguɓe ɗon be yabande maɓɓe do hosa balɗe 17 dai-dai.""
*   This translates to: ""Each migrating group among them travels and stays for 17 days exactly.""

The passage explicitly mentions that the nomadic groups stay in a location for 17 days, making option C the correct answer.
"
"Daga bindoul, bi'a ngoltoi fsmtini hali kondorle sa'e Nomadic hali?","Based on the provided text:

*   The passage describes a nomadic community that moves to different locations.
*   It states that the community stays in each location for 17 days.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: Jahagal 17 nƴalde wala sabɓugo** (Staying for 17 days without stopping)."
Tolger tokkidi jakkata koda wodi external cues?,"Based on the context and the provided text, the most likely answer is **C: Agogoji biological**.

Here's why:

* **P mentions ""Agogo dum be taginga ha banduji"" (P mentions ""biological clocks within bodies"").** This directly relates to the concept of biological clocks.
* **The passage also discusses internal regulation and rhythms within living beings.** This is a key characteristic of biological clocks.
* **Q is asking about triggers that can affect internal clocks.**

While other options might be relevant in a broader context of timing and behavior, biological clocks are the most directly connected to the information presented in passage P. Therefore the answer is most likely **C**.
"
Kalimawol toi tindinta tagao hollata feredirki hude phenotypic alama?,"The question is asking for a term that describes variation in phenotypic traits. Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Na'u igooteljanjoji (Unclear)**: This doesn't seem to be a relevant term.
*   **B: Tagdi (Translation: Variation)**: This is the most likely correct answer. Variation, in a biological context, refers to the differences in traits within a population.
*   **C: Jinsitagle (Translation: Genetic)**: This relates to genes, which cause phenotypic variation, but it doesn't directly describe it.
*   **D: Nau iduddosnshamjoojoum (Unclear)**: This also doesn't appear to be a relevant term.

Therefore, the best answer is **B: Tagdi**.
"
Toi der tokkidi woni kalimawol tagdi njodidi e nokkure wondi?,"Based on the context and the limited information in the provided text, the best answer seems to be **C: Jinsitagle**.

Here's why:

* **Context:** The passage discusses classifying things based on shared characteristics within a single level or layer.  The question asks what term describes this kind of inherent relatedness or connection in a shared space.

* **""Jinsitagle""**  While I don't have direct translation for these words, based on the flow of language and the broader theme,  ""Jinsitagle"" sounds like it could refer to ""shared characteristics"" or ""common ancestry"" within a specific group. The prefix ""Jin-"" often relates to origin or kind in several African languages.

* **Other options:**
    * **A: Na'u igooteljanjoji** and **D: Nau iduddosnshamjoojoum**  These options appear to be nonsensical strings of characters without meaning or connection to the context.
    * **B: Jama'are**  While Jama'are could refer to a community or group, it doesn't necessarily imply inherent, built-in relatedness based on the given classification process of the text.

**Therefore, ""Jinsitagle"" is the most probable answer because it logically aligns with the concept of shared qualities and origins within a group discussed in the preceding passage.**"
Toi der tokkidi lattata misalu nature-based ganshi mabottu gite hudoji?,"The correct answer is **B: photography fudirle**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage (P) describes nature-based tourism activities** in a wildlife area. These activities include things like taking photos, observing wildlife, and learning about the environment.
*   **Photography** directly aligns with the description of people wanting to visit the area to see animals and the forest and take photos.
*   **Other options are not so relevant to tourism based on nature**

So, photography is the most relevant example of nature-based tourism from the provided options."
"Daga bindoul, toi der lokkidi woni arni tsari jahagal?","Based on the provided information and the options given, the most likely answer is:

*   **C: Biosphere dardidoum**

**Explanation**

The passage speaks of the impact of carbon emissions on the atmosphere and how it affects living things. The biosphere encompasses all living organisms and their environment on Earth, so option C is the most relevant."
kukonje tarats nucleus don mari kala iri chanji toi?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is:

**A: Sembeɓɓeddoujoum**

**Explanation:**

The text states that electrons have an ""lantarki je vodai"" (negative electrical charge). Since electrons are orbiting the nucleus, they possess an electrical charge. The answer that means electrical change or electricity is option A, ""Sembeɓɓeddoujoum"".
"
Nder nucleus don hauti kukan toi?,"The passage states: ""Nucleus do mari kuje didi ha der majum - neutrons be protons.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: furotons be newtrons**.
"
"Daga bindoul, toi der tokkidi woni misali je joi bit binari nomba?","Based on the definition of binary numbers given in P (using only 0 and 1), the correct answer is:

**C: 10010**

Here's why:

*   **Binary Numbers:** Binary numbers use only two digits: 0 and 1.
*   **Options:**
    *   A: 1010 - Correct format, uses only 0 and 1.
    *   B: 12001 - Incorrect, uses the digit 2.
    *   C: 10010 - Correct format, uses only 0 and 1.
    *   D: 110101 - Correct format, uses only 0 and 1.

Since the questions asks which one has a ""joi bit binary nomba,"" and ""joi"" would most likely be translated to five, we need to find a 5 bit binary number. Both 1010 and 110101 are not 5 bits, and B is not a binary number at all. That means the correct answer is C.
"
Binary digits doun vire dume?,"The correct answer is **A: Bits**.

The text clearly states that ""lambaji do on be dyonata lamba binary ko bits,"" meaning binary numbers are called bits.
"
Toi der tokkiɗi innaka nder bindoul dou arngol naf jangobe blogging?,"Based on the provided text (P), the best answer is **A: wodi'etingo ha wolide se wawugo bindi** (developing their writing and communication skills).

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes the benefits of blogging for developing writing skills (""wawan a walla ɓikkoi ekkita no ɓe numata boɗɗum; a nota ko ɓe windi ɓe emi ma, bannin ɓe laran windi himɓe fere ɓe anda ko kamɓe fu ɓe fami hala man"" - ""You can help children learn to think well; note what they write and correct it, let them read writing from other people so they know they understand the matter"").

While the other options might be indirectly related, the primary focus is on improving writing and communication."
Toi der tokkidi dofe blogging do sappa ho himmidinta jangoɓe wodena ɓingi?,"Based on the provided text passages, the closest answer is **C: hakkilango gidadoum heditoɓe (understanding the guide/importance of reading)**.

Here's why:

*   **Passage P emphasizes the impact of blogs:** The passage describes how blogs can influence readers and potentially change their perspectives. It also talks about how blogs can help people learn new things and express themselves better. This aligns with the idea of understanding the importance of reading and the guidance that blogs can provide.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Lautau jabugo defte dou internet (Accepting books on the internet):** While the passage mentions writing on the internet, the core theme isn't simply about accepting online books but about the influence and benefits of blog writing.
*   **B: Sha'awa hisugo felore (Desire to save time):** Although blogs might offer quick information, the passage doesn't primarily focus on time-saving as a benefit.
*   **D: Haje kautal hore (The need for self-reflection):** While blogs can encourage self-expression, the main point isn't the need for self-reflection but rather the overall impact of blog writing and reading.

Therefore, option C is the most appropriate answer."
Toi der tokkidi wonai nafu asynchronos guje jangobe? ,"The best answer is **C: Flexible wakkati kugal** (Flexible work time).

Here's why:

* **The passages emphasize the flexibility of online learning.** Passage P specifically mentions that students can learn at their own pace and access resources whenever they need them. They can also contact instructors and receive answers quickly, without being tied to a specific time or location.  This points directly to flexible work time as a benefit.

* **Asynchronous Learning and Flexibility:** Asynchronous learning means learning doesn't happen in real-time.  Students access materials, complete assignments, and communicate with instructors at different times. This is precisely why ""Flexible wakkati kugal"" aligns with the concept.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Nafturgo internet dou naftinir doum (Using the internet is beneficial):** While true, this is a general statement about the internet's benefits and not specific to the *asynchronous* benefits discussed in the passages.

* **B: Yeso-e-yeso sarari to mallumin ton ndei (Face-to-face interaction with the teacher):** This contradicts the idea of asynchronous learning. Asynchronous learning minimizes or eliminates the need for real-time, face-to-face interaction.

* **D: Yawugo Hakkilingo (Enhancing Understanding):** While online resources and learning *can* enhance understanding, the passages focus more on the *convenience* and *flexibility* of the asynchronous approach.
"
"Daga bindoul, toi ger tokkidi yere asynchronous communication nana flexible ha jangobe ba?","The correct answer is **D: Nafturgo internet (Nafturgo internet)**.

Here's why:

*   **The text (P) clearly discusses the benefits of internet use for learning.** It highlights how the internet allows learners to access information easily, communicate with teachers at their convenience, and receive quick answers without needing face-to-face interaction.
*   The question (Q) asks what supports asynchronous communication and flexibility for students. The internet, as described in the text, directly enables these things.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: Yaudu famugo Janade (Understanding learning)**: While important for learning in general, this doesn't directly address asynchronous communication and flexibility.
*   **B: Sa'eje kugal (Work times):** The passage discusses work times, but not as a direct enabler of asynchronous learning.
*   **C: Umroje deftere (Book references)**: Book references are tools for information but don't explicitly offer asynchronous communication and flexibility.

Therefore, the internet is the best fit."
Dume innaka der bindoul dou hude marɗe alaga be medeeval castle?,"The question is asking for what is described in the text in relation to medieval castles. The description talks about battles, horses, and things that would be associated with Arthur.

*   **A: Dungeon budɗe** - Dungeons are prisons, not a specific event.
*   **B: Jousts** - The description of horses, battles, and contests aligns well with a jousting tournament.
*   **C: Neidi** - This doesn't relate to the context.
*   **D: Honobe** - This also doesn't relate to the context.

Therefore, the most suitable answer is **B: Jousts**."
Toi der tokkidi innaka gel bindoul dou kisiri ko sautu hedititteɗer castle to yemɓi?,"Based on the passage and the question ""What sound is mentioned in the passage that resonates from the castle?"", the correct answer is:

**B: Kulol (Kulol translates to sound/noise)**

The passage specifically mentions the ""fiyugo duuke je kosde pucci ha bandu ka'a"" (sound of horses' hooves on stone) which relates to the sounds heard coming from the castle."
Toi der tokkidi lallata tindinore kirby Muxloe castles?,"Based on the passage provided (which is in Fula), the correct answer is **B: Doum tafi wod enonge seddagam leddi jonde jam wakkati nƴibaso**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that in the 1480s, Lord Hastings started building it, during a time when the land didn't have much peace. This aligns directly with option B.

Let's examine why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Castles Mahi jerdi di torama lord hastings:** Although the passage stated that Lord Hastings built the fort, the sentence in this option does not make any sense.
*   **C: The castles nƴibugo fere-fere luttude ha sare mun:** This translates to ""The castles vary in their city limits,"" which is not a central point made in the passage.
*   **D: Doum nƴiɓama ngam kiffe sharudu duddu:** This means, ""It was built for many reasons of requirement,"" which is not mentioned in the passage."
Toi der tokkidi hollota hositirte handi be kirby maxloe castle wakkati titidinire ha bindoul?,"Based on the original text, the most likely answer is **D: Mahdi shelɗe**

Here's why:

*   The original text mentions Lord Hasting starting construction because the lands had little peace. This suggests a need for defenses and protection.

Therefore, building walls would be the most relevant action taken in the context provided."
"Daga bindoul, toi nder tokkidi wonata burdudoum nafu ha doggowo taskanowo hitaande fijirde warore?","Based on the provided passage (P) and the question (Q), the correct answer is **D: Nafturgo gym ha yoka bandu dou (Using the gym to increase body mass).**

Here's why:

* **Passage P** emphasizes the importance of strength and speed (""yawugo juɗe be sembe atugo kujeji wawata wonna ɗum""). It also suggests that a good cross-country runner needs to build their physique (""valla ɓandu goɗɗo"").
* **Question Q** asks which training method would be most beneficial for a cross-country runner in the pre-season.

Therefore, using the gym to increase body mass directly addresses the need for strength described in the passage and would be the most beneficial training method *before* the season begins.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Ekkutuggo doggudu ger wuro sa'e goldoure (Practicing running in the countryside/golden hour):** This is about general conditioning and stamina, which are essential but not as focused on pre-season preparation as strength.
*   **B: Hakkilongo sobugo kafal sa'e ettukugo (Concentrating on breathing techniques while climbing):** Breathing is important, but not the primary focus for pre-season building.
*   **C: Artugo minti tati wakkati (Returning/Improving three-minute time):** This is about speed and performance during races, which is more relevant *during* the season, not pre-season building."
"Daga bindoul, toi der tokkidi buri nafu ha first class half mile dogguwa?","Based on the provided text, the best answer is **C: Wakkati hewtam ger minti ɗiɗi (Time less than two minutes)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage P** explicitly states that objects that can be thrown for up to two minutes are the focus. This directly relates to achieving a specific time.

The other options are less relevant to the information provided:

*   **A: ekkotuggo doggodu ɗer wuro sa'e leddi jaangou (Training running in the city instead of the field)** Although this might be helpful for overall fitness, the passage highlights the two minute time frame.
*   **B: Subogu minƴal dow kafal (Speed of mind on foot)**: This sounds like a philosophical concept and not a directly measurable performance metric.
*   **D: subogu jawal dou munƴal (Speed of courage on patience)**: This is another philosophical concept that isn't helpful in answering the question.

The passage emphasizes the *duration* of activity (under two minutes) as a key performance indicator.
"
"Ha fijowo, toi nder tokkidi hebata ko hedi nƴamundaji?","Based on the information in passage P, here's the breakdown:

*   Passage P discusses things that ""help"" improve the body when resting:
    *   Getting enough sleep.
    *   Eating healthy foods
    *   Drinking water regularly
    *   Taking supplements
    *   Exercise and games (This is included in what is described as a process to improve the body while resting).

*   The question in Q asks: ""In playing, what will happen after receiving enough nutrition?""

Based on these options, here's what we can determine:

*   **A: Wod'etubgo kugal (Exercise)** Exercise is mentioned in the passage as beneficial.
*   **B: Beddari beldoum (Better taste)** - The passage mentioned better feeling and pleasure during exercise.
*   **C: Kugal burdugal (Greater Exercise)** - Exercise is mentioned in the passage as beneficial.
*   **D: Nonde jam (Healthy Sleep)** - Getting enough sleep is mentioned in the passage.

**Therefore, the best answer is:**

*   **C: Kugal burdugal (Greater Exercise)**

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that exercise is one of the things that help improve the body, so greater exercise would be a direct result of the process."
"Daga bindoul, toi nder tokkidi sappaka horugo lowol darkeen fijobe ha heba fore beldoum ha fijirle mabbe?","Based on the passage provided:

*   The passage talks about things you can do to improve your body (bedda jamu derke'en je dimbata bandu), including eating healthy (nyamugo nyamdu bandu ma mari haje tan watta a habda masin) and taking supplements (heftugo je iri iri jre(supplementation)).

The question asks:

*   What is included in the advice for football players to improve their fitness so that they can play better?

Considering this, the best answer is:

*   **A: Nƴamugo ko hadi** (Eating healthy/Nutritious food)

The passage directly mentions eating as a key part of improving one's body (including, presumably, for athletes). The other options do not align as well with the core message of the provided text."
"Daga bindoul, dume wadi daral deideya wol doggowo sodata kare kugal naude?","The provided text seems to be in Fulfulde (P) and possibly Hausa (Q and answer options). Let's break it down to understand the question and answers:

**P (Fulfulde - Approximate Translation):**

""The entrance to the game is very cheap, but people there gather on top of things they use so that when they want to enter the game, they can. Things to buy are readily available, but some are very expensive or have no value at all to their cost. The game is shown based on chance or useless things that have no benefit to them.""

**Q (Hausa - Approximate Translation):**

""From this discussion, what made each of the racers buy tools or working materials?""

**Answer Options (Hausa - Approximate Translations):**

*   **A: Doum suba doum mabbe** - ""It's their own choice/preference."" (likely incorrect contextually)
*   **B: Dum don mari nafu tabbitinama** - ""That has an established benefit."" (doesn't fit well - the passage notes items can be *useless*)
*   **C: Dum shafai kuuɗe mabbe masin** - ""It facilitates their work very much."" (likely correct, the racers need the tools)
*   **D: Don wodi soide famugo taoni kane kuuɗe hoiɗe** - ""There's a way to understand each person's work."" (less direct than C, doesn't speak to reason for purchase)

**Therefore, the best answer is C: Dum shafai kuuɗe mabbe masin** because it most directly suggests the purchase of the tools/materials is to make their ""work"" (i.e., racing) easier or possible.

**Final Answer: C**
"
"Daga bindoul, dume duggudu?","Based on the passage (P), the closest and most accurate answer is:

**C: ko naftinerti sedda**

Here's why:

*   **P states**: ""...amma fere ɗo maran ko hani seɗɗa ko ma wala sam do kuɗe mai."" This directly translates to ""but some have only a little or even nothing of their value.""
*   **Q asks**: ""...dume duggudu?"" which translates to ""what is value/worth?""

**Therefore, the answer to ""what is value/worth?"" based on the passage, is ""ko naftinerti sedda"" - having little value.**

The other options are less relevant or contradictory to the passage:

*   **A: ko naftinarti duuɗam** (having a lot of value) - This contradicts the passage's description of items in the playground.
*   **B: Asŋgal wanginagol ngoi fijirde** (a place to start the game) - This is about the function of the playground, not the value of its items.
*   **D: shede duudde** (a lot of money) - The passage indicates that the items have little or no monetary value."
Nder ha nuclear magnetic resonance? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch be purcell**.

The passage states: ""...Felix Bloch mo huwata (ha Makaranta mauɓe ha Stanfod) be Edwod Pusel mo huwata (ha makaranta maubɓe ha Havad) on hefti ɗum."" This clearly indicates that Felix Bloch and Edward Purcell developed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).
"
Hitago toi patent arande hokka na'em nƴanda imaging resonance? ,"The correct answer is **D: 1970**.

The text states: ""Dubi nayi ko salali (patent) hebi,kangum on fudurde tyelade je duniyaro ha pellel MRI."" This translates to ""Four years later (after 1970), he obtained a patent, which was the beginning of MRI technology in the world."" This implies that the initial mention of 1970 is the starting point, and the patent was obtained shortly thereafter.
"
"Daga bindoul, dume hibɓe adama famata hebi fassira kuuɗe bangi ɗe le wobɓe fere?","The correct answer is **B: Anniya**.

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses the ability to understand the intentions, desires, and knowledge of other people. This is essentially what ""Anniya"" (intention) refers to. The passage argues that understanding intentions is very useful, as it allows us to predict people's behaviour and potentially prevent negative outcomes.
*   The other options don't fit as well:
    *   A: Sha'awa (desire, passion) - While desire is part of what's being understood, the passage is about the broader ability to understand the purpose behind actions.
    *   C: Nudɗinore (belief, conviction) - This refers to what someone believes is true, not necessarily their intentions.
    *   D: Numo (memory, recollection) - This is about past events, not understanding current intentions."
"Daga binfoul, fmugo anniya waltidon bi adama wada dume?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is:

**D: Janga numo wobɓe fere**

The passage discusses the ability to understand the intentions and feelings of others, essentially ""reading"" their minds. This aligns perfectly with option D, which translates to ""Read the minds of other people.""

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Itta seko bawo kuɗe wanguɗe** (Remove doubt after doing something): This doesn't relate to understanding others' intentions.
*   **B: Numa ngam hefta sha'awaji** (Think to gain consultations): This emphasizes thinking for one's own gain of consultations.
*   **C: Lara biadma'een fere wala kita** (Look for new information or something else): This is too general and doesn't capture the specific skill of understanding intentions."
"Daga bindoul, toi der tokkidi woni sedda AI's bote?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: Heftuo sauto denɗe (Heftuo murya)**.

Here's why:

*   The text mentions AI's ability to recognize voices (and faces):  ""...bebo je vinvi koh heftata, murya be yeso"""
"Daga bindoul, toi der tokkidi dou AI's borna Fu wondi?","Based on the text, the best answer is **B: Taskaram be wadi kuuɗe**.

The passage states: ""Bincikeji ha Al hauti wadugo kare kimiya be fasaha ɗum wawata gasnugo be hoore majum kuɗe ɗum yiɗi waɗugo bo naftira aandal waɗa kuɗe man."" This translates to ""Research in AI includes making chemical and technical things that it can accomplish on its own the tasks it wants to do and use knowledge to do those tasks."" This directly supports the idea that a core benefit of AI is its ability to accomplish tasks.
"
"Daga bindoul, toi der tokkidi lattara sembe goddo mardo numo petel wabi?","Based on the passage, convergent thinking involves focusing on finding the single best answer. This means someone with a convergent thinking style would be less likely to consider multiple possibilities. Therefore, the answer is:

*   **A: Heftugo jawabuǰi duudɗi je shaddum (Considering many possible answers)** - This is the opposite of convergent thinking.

So the best answer is **A**."
"Daga bindoul, toi der tokkidi hosata teake dou famɗugo numo?","Based on the passage, the most accurate answer is **A: Famugo wodi jawabu gotel tan**.

The passage states: ""kuje ɓuri nafu ha iri numugo ɗo kanjum on: a anda ansa gotel on tan gonga."" This directly translates to ""the most useful thing in this type of thinking is: you know only one answer is correct."" Therefore, understanding that there is only one correct answer is key to this type of thinking.

"Daga bindoul, toi de tokkidi lattata micro-expression?","The passage from Oliver Sacks discusses how people can understand the *form* of communication but not necessarily the *content* or the *truth* behind it. He even describes how people can misunderstand human expressions and apply them to animals.

None of the options (A-D) are explicitly mentioned in the passage, so this passage isn't about what micro-expressions are. However, ""furrowing the brow"" (B) and ""Majje jauɗe"" (C) are expressions or gestures that could be considered subtle cues or body language that people might misinterpret or focus on, as discussed in the passage.

However, given the context of understanding a speaker's intention, ""Larugo fere wakkati wolige"" (A) is the closest answer to micro-expression because it describes a shift in the gaze (which could be indicative of lying, hesitation, etc.), although that is not stated in the text.

Based on the overall theme of the passage, and the implicit connection to micro-expressions, **A** is probably the intended correct answer.
"
Toi der biyadi heɗi micro-expression fassirta na gonga?,"The most relevant answer to the question ""Toi der biyadi heɗi micro-expression fassirta na gonga?"" is:

*   **D: Doum wallitan fama gondinare**

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses the difficulty people have in understanding true emotions and intentions, even when they can analyze behavior well. Micro-expressions are subtle, fleeting facial expressions that can reveal true emotions. The passage suggests that understanding these expressions can help us better understand people's underlying feelings and intentions.

The other options are less relevant because:

*   **A: Video hosugo hebi hedɗari sosare:** While video recordings can be used to study micro-expressions, this option doesn't directly address the question of whether understanding micro-expressions reveals the truth.
*   **B: Shahidoum fassara heftan fewre:** This option talks about interpreting arguments, which isn't directly related to the concept of micro-expressions and understanding true emotions.
*   **C: Wolde ɓe tindi nore fassirte:** This option focuses on interpreting spoken words, which is different from interpreting the non-verbal cues of micro-expressions."
Toi der tokkidi wartata suribote ngam renaissance? ,"The passage P describes a situation where traditional knowledge was lost or corrupted, and then a new system of education and knowledge sharing emerged in Christian lands, leading to progress. This sounds very much like a description of events leading up to and including the Renaissance.

The question asks: ""What is the central reason for the renaissance?""

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Nƴonitago godde (Return to the roots):** This could relate to rediscovering classical knowledge, a core element of the Renaissance.

*   **B: Ƴedugo andal (Increase of knowledge):** This is a direct consequence of the Renaissance, as it was a period of significant intellectual advancement.

*   **C: Bindoul nƴonitago (The creation of roots):** This option makes no sense given the context and question.

*   **D: Hebougo Habarouji (Acquisition of news):** This doesn't directly relate to the causes or the core nature of the Renaissance.

While ""Return to the roots"" is part of it, ""Increase of knowledge"" is more the fundamental defining characteristic of the Renaissance. It's the pursuit and growth of knowledge that drove the era.

Therefore, the best answer is **B: Ƴedugo andal (Increase of knowledge)**.
"
"Dalila renaissance, falere ustaama dou toi der tokkidi?","The correct answer is **B: Hebougo andal (Getting Knowledge)**.

Here's why:

* **The Passage (P) emphasizes the loss of knowledge and the subsequent recovery of knowledge during the Renaissance.** It mentions a group that lost the ability to understand and replicate something, followed by a recovery of knowledge in the Nasara lands (likely referring to Europe) during the time of education and learning.

* **The Question (Q) asks about what increased/became more valuable because of the Renaissance.**

* **Option B, ""Hebougo andal"" (Getting Knowledge), directly aligns with the core theme of the passage and the impact of the Renaissance.** The Renaissance was a period of renewed interest in classical learning and a great expansion of knowledge.
The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Nƴonitago godde** (Criticizing gods) isn't the focus of the passage.
*   **C: Bindoul nƴonitago** (Writing to Criticize) is also irrelevant.
*   **D: Sendugo haɓarudi** (Sending messages/Spreading News): The passage does not directly focus on this.

**Therefore, the best answer is B.**"
Der dou tokkidi toi wala holla yidogo naftirgo internet ngam ɓedyo alaka?,"Based on the passage provided, the answer is **A: Sipporde networking** (Social networking).

Here's why:

*   The passage states the internet has ""opened up huge new avenues and ways for people to interact with each other"".
*   The passage mentions ""being able to connect"" is a new capability identified.
*   ""Sipporde networking"" directly translates to social networking, which is about building and maintaining relationships with others, and aligns with the idea of increased connection facilitated by the internet.

The other options are less directly related to the passage's emphasis on human connection and interaction:

*   **B: Hakkilingo be lenyol (Cognition and language):** While the internet may affect cognition and language, the passage primarily focuses on social interaction.
*   **C: Jahale findinoje (Research findings):** The passage refers to research on how people perceive the changes brought by the internet, not on the internet facilitating research findings in general.
*   **D: Fattugo be himbe (Human perception):** The passage is about the impact of the internet, which is studied by humans, not the internet is used to study humans, that make this option less relevant than social networking."
toi ɗer tokkidi hollai himma nafturgo internet ngam doremain?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Posting dou online alluha dgent**.

Here's why:

* **The passage mentions ""wondugo be himɓe"" (connecting with people) as a key aspect of the internet.** Posting on an online forum (alluha dgent) is a direct example of connecting and interacting with others online.
* The other options, while potentially related to internet usage, aren't directly emphasized as key changes in the way people relate to each other as highlighted in the initial text.

Therefore, B is the most aligned option with the passage and its focus on the social and communicative impact of the internet.
"
Dei woylo Europe asshi lammiturgodow itti lamurde?,"Based on the passage P, the Gothic style lasted from the 10th-11th centuries to the 14th century. The question in Q asks when Western Europe started to embrace its own style. The passage mentions that towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own unique style. This aligns with the later part of the Gothic period. The passage states that Western Europe's own style occurred ""Wakkati duuɓi ckaka badi timmugo,"" which translates to ""towards the end of the Middle Ages"". This aligns with the end of the time frame described in P.

The best answer is D: Wakkati karnu 11th
"
Hutinirgo botton ngam namga limse ngam ha ɗume? ,"Based on the passage, the Gothic style drew initial influence from the Byzantine tradition:

""Ha fuddorde man limse man do naftira al’ada himbe Byzantine je ha fuuna.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: Jamanu Byzantine**
"
"Daga bindoul, tpi der tokkidi woni lawol doingol je wod'enta sha'aniji nokure?","Based on the context provided in passage P, which discusses problem-solving, growth, and understanding within a changing world, the most relevant answer from the choices provided in Q is:

*   **C: Famugo asli yakeji (Understanding core principles)**

**Explanation:**

*   The passage emphasizes the need to understand the underlying causes of problems to solve them effectively (""sai en tefa ko waddata matsalaji mai, sai en nyifa dum""). This aligns directly with ""famugo asli yakeji,"" which translates to understanding core principles or fundamental nature.

Let's analyze why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Lotuki ngedam majjinirinɗe (Resource extraction/exploitation):** While resources are important, the passage focuses more on knowledge, understanding, and progress rather than purely on exploiting resources.
*   **B: Activism:** While activism can be a tool for change, the passage has a broader scope encompassing general problem-solving and growth beyond specifically activist actions.
*   **D: Waturgo sobajo yahdu nokkure (Encouraging local tourism):** Tourism is not related to the context given in the text.

**Therefore, option C, ""Famugo asli yakeji (Understanding core principles),"" is the most fitting answer because it reflects the passage's focus on gaining a deeper understanding of problems and situations to facilitate progress and solve them effectively.**"
"Daga bindoul, toi ɗer tokkidi dabareji hosataake dou alama nƴalindigu sha'anidi nokkure?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: Nƴifugo daga daɗi fudɗorde kuje (Eliminating from the roots of things)**.

Here's why:

*   **P states:** ""...toh en yida lekki labbina, sai en tefa ko waddata matsalaji mai, sai en nyifa dum."" This translates to ""If we want to fix the tree, we must find what causes the problem and eliminate it."" This directly supports the idea of eliminating problems from their roots.
*   **The other options:**

    *   A: Notugo ɗer activism (Taking part in activism) - While implied in a general sense, it's not the direct solution described.
    *   C: Valwigo numo dou hali maljingou shei (Evaluate on the state of things happening) - Evaluation is a good step, but not the ultimate action.
    *   D: Yeɗugo dou nokkure fewɗe lawo (Speaking on a few place law) - Focuses on speaking and law, not related to the root problem.

Therefore, option B best aligns with the strategy outlined in the paragraph."
Ha leddi toi konu arande wu ha europe be numata dou fonnugo lamu dou diina?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is:

**B: Almania**

The passage refers to the Thirty Years' War, which was a major conflict in Europe largely centered in what is now Germany. It highlights this war as a turning point in religious conflicts and the balance of power in Europe. Although the text mentions Spain, the focus of the conflict related to religious war and the restructuring of power is linked to the Thirty Years' War, making Germany the more relevant answer.
"
Konu toi wakkati fere tinɗina dou ragere konu diina?,"Based on the provided text, the answer is **A: Koni dubi shattsn e tati (Konu dubɓi Cappanɗe tati')**.

The text mentions ""Duɓɓi Cappanɗe tati’ haɓre yaqi lartan je qarshe je holli haɓre yaki diina."" which translates to ""The Thirty Years' War put an end to the religious wars."" This directly answers the question about a war that ended religious wars.
"
Toinder tokkidi sa'e catholic masihinkero waditaaka?,"Based on the provided text, the answer that best fits is:

**D: To asli nuddenero masihinkero heɓa ke**

Here's why:

The passage describes how the Catholic Church in Europe gained wealth and power. This aligns with the idea that ""original believers in Christianity gained something"" (the 'ke' in the answer). The passage details the Church's influence over rulers and the belief that donations to the Church brought blessings and reduced suffering. Thus, the Church's original followers, or rather those associated with the church, benefitted.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: To ƴebre njeundi nder masihinkeru fotidi** - This refers to the ""weakening of faith,"" which isn't the main point of the passage. The passage focuses on the Church's power and wealth, not a decline in faith itself.
*   **B: To asli niddinare dinna ban firlitito** - This refers to a ""reversal of religious principles,"" which isn't the main focus. While the Church might have been perceived as acting against certain principles due to its wealth, the passage itself doesn't explicitly state a reversal of principles.
*   **C: yofanki sembe der masihinkero** - This refers to the ""growth of power in Christianity."" While true, the question is about the results of the action. So, this choice, while being correct, is not the best answer from the given choices.

**In summary, option D accurately reflects the outcome described in the passage: the original adherents/followers of the Christian faith (specifically through the Catholic Church) gained significantly (wealth and power).**"
"Daga bindoul golli, noɗo ɓara ha Versailles?","Based on the provided text, the answer is **A: Goto ɗer roube lumo (One of the market women)**.

The passage states that the King and Queen were forcibly brought to Paris from Versailles ""daga versailes gal hawtirde rewɓe lumo (from Versailles by a group of market women)"". This directly indicates that market women were involved in the events at Versailles.
"
Toi nder tokkidi dolake dou Lamido be Queen Vultibe?,"The correct answer is **D: Jahagal hotugo Paris**

The passage states that the royal family was forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789. This is directly mentioned in the passage.
"
Toi Derek tokkidi lethal dLula Britain's dabareji kenu koboje?,"Based on the passage, the most logical answer is **A: Germany yeli huwira dabareje konu (Germany yeli huwira dabareje konu)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Germany responded to Britain's naval blockade (which hindered their supplies) by using their own form of naval warfare, implicitly suggesting a tit-for-tat approach.
*   The passage mentions that Germany intended to use their submarines in a similar manner to the naval blockade.

The other options are less directly supported by the passage:

*   **B: Kobje dariɗe nasdi lawol tosku:** While the blockade had consequences, the passage doesn't explicitly state that it opened a route for success.
*   **C: Dokaji lesdi duniyaro firlitaama:** The passage mentions the blockade as a violation of international law, but doesn't say that those laws were changed.
*   **D: Kareji tilimde he ɓataake:** The passage does not mention guards are sent or sent a message.
"
Der ke viisa do toi tindinai no koboje Britain aati Germany?,"Based on the text provided, the most likely answer is:

*   **C: Doum ta'e waddugo kare Germany** (It hampered Germany's efforts/war).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Britain implemented a naval blockade on Germany, which led to shortages of essential goods for both civilians and soldiers. This directly impacted Germany's ability to wage war effectively."
"Daga bindoul, moije hottida be nƴau sclerosis ko buti numougo?","Based on the information provided, women are more likely than men to develop MS. Therefore, the most likely person to develop MS from the options is:

**A: Ɗebbo mo dubi 32** (A woman who is 32 years old)

So the answer is **A**.
"
"Daga bindoul, natigo fijirle yiɗi wakide dume?","The correct answer is **A: Negative tammunde nawɗum (Negative expectations of weight loss)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the difficulties people face with weight loss:** It mentions the cultural and social pressures, the frustration with slow progress, and the difference between expectations and reality.
* **""Negative tammunde nawɗum"" directly addresses this issue.** People's expectations of how quickly and easily they'll lose weight often don't align with reality, leading to discouragement.  This ""negative expectation"" is a significant hurdle.
* The other options don't fit as well:

* **B: Less bawo (Less following?)** Doesn't make much sense in the context of weight loss.
* **C: Billare yonki (Soul's invoice?)** Also doesn't fit the context.
* **D: Kulol (Fear)** While fear might play a small role (fear of failure, fear of not meeting expectations), the core issue is the *expectation* itself, not fear as the primary driver.
"
"Daga bindoul, noi fencing fijirte?","The passage states that fencing is played from primary school to university levels, including working people and national representatives. This indicates its presence at various levels, including potentially university and national/Olympic levels.

The options are:

*   A: Nou dum wajirte kesum (Because it is a new game)
*   B: Ha daraja Jami'a (At the university level)
*   C: Ha daraja Olympic (At the Olympic level)
*   D: Didɗi di (Both of them)

Since the passage mentions university level and ""himbe je wannata leddi mabbe"" (people who represent their country) which strongly suggests Olympic level, the best answer is:

**D: Didɗi di (Both of them)**"
"Daga bindoul, toi der tokkidi tinkinta toknodu der-der shatudon?","Based on the passage P, which describes symptoms and a need for first aid, the best answer is:

* **A: Nƴaude be nausea bandus**

Here's why:

* **Passage Focus:** The passage describes a medical emergency. ""Alaamaji, banta ture do Fe,’a masin gamman be wawata be hefta masibo man ha wakkati man"" suggests something hindering movement or function. ""Ko ɓuri hollugo alama guba do ɓaandu goɗɗo tema kaanjum on to faandu do wala maɓɓode bo nane ma je kuje wawata mbarugo goɗɗo on"" refers to serious, potentially life-threatening issues.

* **Nƴaude be nausea bandus (Weakness and feeling sick)** Weakness and feeling sick would be appropriate responses to the medical situation mentioned in the prompt.

* **Other options are less likely:** While the other options contain medical-related terms, they don't align as closely with the described symptoms or a likely first aid need.

**Therefore, A is the most reasonable choice.**
"
"Daga bindoul, toi hakkata ko buri haɗugo arande tou naunido don lare?","Based on the context of paragraph P and question Q, here's the breakdown and the likely correct answer:

*   **Paragraph P (translated):** ""P: If you want to see that sick person, you must start with something that will help you get peace. You must know where that sick person is, and whether they will be comfortable to see something like that. If you listen later and ask for help, it will make their condition worse.""

*   **Question Q (translated):** ""Q: From the beginning, what is the most important thing to ensure that the sick person is comfortable before seeing something?""

Based on this, here's why the best answer is likely:

*   **A: Hakkilan Yakere** - Likely this refers to ""Respectful Understanding"" or ""Showing Respect,"" which is important when dealing with a sick person.

*   **B: Tawu hehaďo** - Without further context, it's difficult to know precisely.

*   **C: Linyitu nolkure hebajo** - Without further context, it's difficult to know precisely.

*   **D: Renu Wallige** - Without further context, it's difficult to know precisely.

**Therefore, the best answer is A: Hakkilan Yakere** because it directly relates to ensuring the sick person's comfort through respect and understanding."
Toi der ko via hollai lawol hautigo nauniɗo?,"Based on the first statement (P) and the question (Q), we can infer the context is about helping someone who is sad or struggling. The question asks how to show you're listening and understanding someone who is sad.

Analyzing the options:

*   **A: Tadamu ɓe haɓugo naunanɗe (Let them finish talking)** This is a good option because allowing the person to express themselves fully is crucial for active listening.

*   **B: Heftu fellel doube nauniɗo (Take care of the sad person)** This is also a good option as it is taking care of them and listening to them.

*   **C: Hakkilan babal nauniɗo (Consider the sad person's situation)** This is a good option because it involves understanding their perspective.

*   **D: Hadďu a hefti kala tutaji bodeji fu (Forget they have any sad moments)** This is a negative response because it's not useful and does not show the person you understand.

From the other options, the options that shows you are listening to someone who is struggling is:
A: Tadamu ɓe haɓugo naunanɗe (Let them finish talking)

Therefore, **A** is the most relevant answer to the question.
"
Toi der Fransa koin konu mari nofil dou huwobe himbe wuro?,"Based on the provided text (P) and question (Q), the correct answer is:

**C: Husogu repoblican tsari lamu**

Here's why:

*   The text (P) explicitly states: ""...chanjugo daga absolutizim yahugo republicanizim..."" This translates to ""a change from absolutism to republicanism"".
*   The question (Q) asks about the outcome/effect of the events described in the context of the French Revolution.
*   Option C ""Husogu repoblican tsari lamu"" corresponds directly to the change towards a republican form of government, which the passage describes.

The other options are either not relevant to the question of a *key outcome* of the revolution, or misinterpret details mentioned in the text."
Bawo konu Fransa nasaraku ha honoɓe ɓe jonde he lesde jalaɗe famditi ngam dume?,"Based on the context provided in passage P, the correct answer is likely **C: Ko gidɗa**. Here's why:

*   The passage discusses how the French Revolution led to changes in who benefited and gained power.
*   It mentions that after the Revolution, opportunities opened up for people who demonstrated zeal and loyalty.
*   The passage also mentions how the army became a way for advancement, emphasizing the importance of enthusiasm and commitment.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that **ko gidɗa** (zeal, passion, enthusiasm) became important after the French Revolution in relation to leadership positions.
"
Toi der kude ngam jama'are waddata mettamɓeram ha lesdi ummoje?,"Based on the context of the initial question (P), which talks about issues with water supply, the most logical answer is:

*   **A: Wudogu nɗiyam (Water pipes)**

The question asks what things can be brought to the country to help with water issues, and water pipes are essential for a working water system. The other options don't directly address water supply:

*   **B: Gada inu nyibogo gada (Building new wells)** - While wells provide water, the initial question seems to focus on distribution and existing water supply issues.
*   **C: Jahaje jamaje (Ships)** - Ships aren't directly related to fixing local water distribution problems.
*   **D: Jangirde (Schools)** - While education is important, it doesn't immediately solve water supply issues."
"Daga bindoul, ko doum viaata dou jahaje jamaje?","The question ""P"" describes a situation with water scarcity, potential corruption, and a lack of knowledge or skill among those managing the water resources.

Question ""Q"" asks what could cause problems in water distribution. Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Doum yiɗe ha mou hutuniri doum f (It needs complete focus on it)** - This is relevant. Proper water management needs thorough planning and execution.
*   **B: Doum hallai bana yake ɗiƴam (It's defective like dirty water)** - This refers to the water itself being contaminated.
*   **C: Dum waddi ella daga mo naftiridoum (It brings illness from using it)** - This speaks to the water causing sickness.
*   **D: Ɓe rimɓe ha lesde mauɗe (People with big lands)** - Irrelevant to the water problem.

Considering the context of the initial problem described in ""P"", the best answer is **A: Doum yiɗe ha mou hutuniri doum f (It needs complete focus on it)**. The problem described in ""P"" points towards a lack of effective management, oversight, and perhaps training. The water resources are mismanaged and leading to an issue.

Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer.
"
"Daga bindoul, nder toi tokkidi saɗata gauge ngam satugo hali lenyeɓe?","Based on the provided text, the answer is **B: Taskaram lawol yatudil (Road Geometry)**. Here's why:

*   The text emphasizes understanding how people move and *what physical features* influence their movement on roads.
*   It talks about factors like ""ila"" (line/path), ""teddugo"" (elevation/grade), and ""doggugo be dayugo pellel"" (speed and lane keeping). These are all elements that define **road geometry.** Road geometry is the design of the road's physical features, affecting how drivers can move safely and efficiently.
*   The text aims to understand how the geometry affects traffic flow, lane keeping, and speed.

The other options are less directly relevant:

*   **Zirgazirga veeloity:** While speed is considered, ""veeloity"" alone doesn't capture the *road's* influence.
*   **Lawol jahagal kuɗeje:** This broadly refers to traffic flow, but the emphasis in the provided text is more on the *physical road characteristics* that influence this flow.
*   **Zirgazirga flow:** Similar to the previous point; it is the outcome.
"
Toi der tokkidihutunirti ha wakkulugo traffic stream mathematically?,"Based on the context provided, the best answer is:

**A: Lawol jahagal kuɗeje**

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses understanding how vehicles move and interact on the road. The question asks what concept is used to mathematically model traffic flow. ""Lawol jahagal kuɗeje"" (traffic flow) directly relates to the concept of modeling the movement of vehicles as a stream.

The other options are less relevant:

*   ""Hali direba"" (drivers) - While drivers are part of traffic, the question asks about modeling the entire flow mathematically.
*   ""Lawoul no wadira"" (how to do it/how it's made) - This is too general.
*   ""Zirgazirga teddali"" (heavy/important zigzag) - This doesn't fit the context of traffic flow modeling."
Dume Hershey ɓe chase naftiri ha awugo DNA maɓɓe? ,"The correct answer is **A: radiyoactivee fosforus**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Hershey and Chase used radioactive phosphorus to tag DNA and radioactive sulfur to tag protein. The question specifically asks what they used to tag their DNA."
Mawugo mutation hokka bikkoi on dou dum?,"Based on the information provided in P, the answer that aligns best is:

**D: To mutation man fouɗan maoɗe cel**

Here's why:

*   **P describes a situation where something foreign (like a ""kuje woɗaka petel mari yonki"") can cause harm, potentially leading to cancer or death.** This aligns with the idea of a mutation causing cells to behave abnormally.
*   **""fouɗan maoɗe cel"" likely refers to mutations affecting cell division or behavior**, which is directly linked to the development of cancer. The other options don't fit the context as well.
Let me know if you'd like me to explain further."
Daga haɓaru heba ɗer bindoul dume kujeji?,"Based on the provided text P, and the question Q asking about factors affecting the material found within cells, the most relevant answer is:

*   **D: Kala je shafi mutation** (Everything that affects mutation)

Here's why:

*   The text refers to ""innitoore do mari illa ferefere"" (something affecting/modifying the material) that can lead to severe problems (""kansa ko mbara goɗɗo ma"" - cancer or killing the person).
*   Mutation refers to any changes to the genetic material. These changes can indeed lead to the problems described in the text.

Let's analyze why the other options are less fitting:

*   **A: Noi dudugu kare genetic man rabi:** (It can be genetic man rabi) This sentence doesn't make sense.
*   **B: To cell ji raɓadi mai latti germ-line:** (To cell and germ-line): This is partially related to mutation, but the general answer is mutation.
*   **C: Jeshafi genetic materials nafu:** (Jeshafi genetic materials benefit) It is not clear what it means by ""Jeshafi"".

Therefore, option D best captures the general idea that factors affecting the material in the cells (""mutation"") is the most suitable answer."
Toi der tokkidi na dalili alada nesugo Ɓe'e?,"Based on the passage P, the correct answer is:

**D: Be hokki lawol hebugo kosam** (They provided a way to get milk)

The passage explicitly states that people started raising goats to get milk (""Al’ada kiddum be himbe fuddi sigugo dum gan hebugo kosam...""). The other options, while potentially related to animal domestication in general, aren't directly mentioned in the passage as reasons for initially raising goats.
"
"Haje golf, itta toi hosata seddo derdum?","The correct answer is **A: Tame**.

The passage describes golf and states ""Je fijobe je hosi bocchi sedda"" which translates to ""The players who have the fewest strokes."" In golf, the goal is to complete the course with the fewest strokes. Therefore, ""tame"" (strokes) is the correct answer.
"
Dow golf haɗoi geyne ta'e rammai?,"Based on the provided text (P), here's the breakdown and the correct answer:

*   **P's Description:** The text describes a game (golf) played with clubs and a ball, aiming to get the ball into a hole in as few strokes as possible. It mentions 18 holes, starting at a tee and finishing at the final hole.

*   **Q's Question:** ""Where does golf start usually?""

*   **Analyzing the Options:**

    *   **A: Ha luggere sappo e jetatire:** (At the eighteenth hole) - Incorrect, golf ends there.
    *   **B: Dow bokko-bokko:** (on rough) - Incorrect, although the rough is a part of the course, it's not the starting point.
    *   **C: Ha wurdere arandere:** (At the first green) - Technically Incorrect, The first hit is done on a tee.
    *   **D: Ha reta arande course man:** (The first tee of the course) - **Correct.** The game begins at the first tee box of the course.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D**."
Toi ger ainihi nafu experiment?,"Based on the context provided in passage P, the correct answer is likely **A: Ittugo gotel kodidi latugo hypothesis**.

Here's why:

* **Passage P focuses on:** The importance of experimentation in science, emphasizing its role in uncovering information and refining understanding. It mentions manipulating variables, observing, and analyzing to improve knowledge.
* **Option A (Ittugo gotel kodidi latugo hypothesis):**  Translates to something like ""Testing one code/idea/concept to validate a hypothesis."" This aligns perfectly with the core idea of experimentation – you change something (the variable) and see if it supports your idea (the hypothesis).
* **Other options are less relevant:**
    * B: Gam fama noi dumi yaro wontiri (Understanding how the world works) is too broad. While true, it's not the *specific* purpose of an experiment.
    * C: Ha nƴama nƴamde (To be eaten) is completely irrelevant.
    * D: Waltta holla scientific heptugo (Help show scientific completeness) While experiments contribute to scientific understanding, the *direct* goal is usually to test a specific hypothesis.

Therefore, **A** is the most accurate and closely connected to the description of experimentation in the passage.
"
"Daga bindoul, toi wallatal holli scientific heftugo?","The correct answer is **D: Wadugo experiment**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes using tools (including data analysis) to manipulate variables and observe results.** This is the core of experimentation. The passage speaks about ""fundugo kuje kam jun on nafturun go ngam a itta kuje gotel ko ko buri banni kowawa ta a heba, emugo, be larugo kam jun fu do walita teffol bincike."" which describes changing things to understand the outcome, that is experimentation.

*   **P** describes a powerful and destructive phenomenon with the following characteristics:

    *   Capable of causing widespread destruction to property
    *   Can lift and throw objects into the air
    *   Extremely high wind speeds (480 km/h / 300 mph)
    *   Multiple incidents in a short period of time

*   **Q** asks: ""From the description, which statement about tornadoes is true?""

*   **A** - Tornadoes can cause devastation to a place.
*   **B** - Tornadoes throw things like dulluru
*   **C** - Most Tornadoes last 3 hours
*   **D** - Tornadoes have some winds or ""dulluru"" that go 300 miles per hour.

Based on what's in prompt P, the strongest answer is **A** and **D**.
**A** best matches the overall description of extreme destruction.
**D** is correct because prompt P states the wind speed gets up to 300mph."
"Daga bindoul, toi der tokkidi welwaadoum tinɗinta koburi tor nadoji?","Based on the provided information, the best answer is **B: Betagi dulluru baha 480 miles ger awa**.

Here's why:

*   The question is asking what the passage describes.
*   The passage explicitly mentions that the storm has winds reaching 480 km/h (approximately 300 mph), with the option providing an answer of 480 miles ger awa which in English is 480 miles per hour which is the closest to that speed.

Therefore, answer **B** is the most relevant and accurate response."
Toi ger tokkidi biɓɓe adama en fuɗɗu wadugo der qarnu 16th?,"The correct answer is **D: Waɗugo telescope**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while magnifying lenses have been around for over a millennium, telescopes were developed in Europe in the 1600s (the 17th century, but the question is the 16th). The passage explicitly mentions telescopes as a new development in that era. The question is asking about something people started doing in the 16th century, which the passage indicates is telescope-making."
Daga ɲɗei himbe wadika mabbutuggoyena kujeji be lenses?,"The correct answer is **C: Dubi Wujenere** (Thousands of years).

The passage states: ""Bil adamajo nemi ɗo naftira be lenses do magnification ko duɓi e duɓare ujineere ujineere."" This translates to ""Humans have been using lenses for magnification for thousands of years.""
"
Nder kisa do dume warini Muhammad ha nder ngaska kuma dume ovi ha kodi wadinimo wayi?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: O Yidi Jode Jam**.

The passage states that Muhammad went to the cave to ""micca hala Rayuwa"" (think about life). This implies a desire for contemplation and peace, aligning with the idea of wanting to be in a state of tranquility (Jode Jam).
"
Ha der kisa do dume be noffin be iron?,"Based on the provided text, the answer is **D: Rels**.

The passage states: ""Ha 1767, lawol jirki ɗum kanju'on artundere be fuɗɗi fiyugo be njamdi fuɗɗi huwugo."" This translates to something like ""In 1767, rails were invented and started being made and used with iron.""
"
Nder kisa do legal wawan wabe ha pelel be naftirda be jamdina?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: Be wagginibe ha dau tarko be waddinibe**.

The passage states that wagonways were initially made of wood. Later, iron plates were added to the wooden rails. Then, the passage mentions a shift to using iron entirely for the rails. This progression supports option D, as wagons are used on railways. The question ""Nder kisa do legal wawan wabe ha pelel be naftirda be jamdina?"" translates to ""In the early days, what was used on the rails to use metal?"".
"
"Nder kisa do, dume walli himbe wakkati Romantism?","The correct answer is **D: Al'adoji Mabbe**.

The passage explicitly states that during Romanticism, ""lesdi hautiri yimɓe, bo do wakkati asli be ɗengal je ɗo nandi be je ekkitol lesdi fuɗɗi, be bo, ɗo nder kawtirde be pellel a woni, ɓuri je umrore hasdi be sembe.""  This translates to something like: ""the nation brought people together, and at that time origin and language became important to national identity, and also, where you are in the community and place, more than the order of wealth and power."" This directly links the rise of Romanticism to the importance of one's own culture (Al'adoji Mabbe). The other options are too broad or not directly mentioned as a key factor.
"
Ha Nder hala do dume on nandaye be kodume hala jai technology determine? ,"Based on the provided text, the best answer is **A: Damuwa technology ha nana dum be dabiya ba** (Technology's influence on society is based on its character or nature).

Here's why:

*   The text describes Technological Determinism as the idea that technology develops on its own, following a predictable path, and *then* influences society, politics, and culture. Therefore the technology comes before society.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Technology yahogo yeso majum nona dole sai be siyasa ba** (Technology's advancement is not solely dependent on politics) - The text contrasts with this by suggesting technology drives change rather than the other way round.
*   **C: Ha der rissado dume on handaibe vutunogo kuri** (In the essay, what are the advantages of technological innovation?) - While the example mentions advancements, the text's primary focus is on the **deterministic** impact of technology, not necessarily its ""advantages.""
*   **D: Technological yahumogon yeso a dow sembe siyasa** (Technological advancements are powered by politics) - The text *explicitly* argues against this; Technological Determinism posits that technology shapes politics, not the other way around.

In summary, the provided text describes how technology influences the way societies operate."

Nder kisa do dume ha kotokkidiri do nandaye be gentler fee'uku?,"The correct answer is **A: Alama Leskuri**

Here's why:

* **The text describes a process for marking (alama) things.** It contrasts two different methods: ""turugo dau"" (marking above) and ""turugo les"" (marking below).
* **The text emphasizes the qualities of ""turugo les.""** It mentions that markings below are stronger and faster.
* **Therefore, the process being described is most related to ""Alama Leskuri""** - Marking Below.

The other options are not as closely related to the text:

* **B: Furtinugo Kuri** (Explanation of Kuri): This is too general. While marking might be part of an explanation, the text is specifically about the marking process itself.
* **C: Alama je namdi Be V** (Marks shaped like a V): The text doesn't specify the shape of the marks, only their position (above or below).
* **D: Faddugu iga ha janguma jugo kori** (Starting from the hand holding the stem): While the text mentions how to hold the stem, this is just part of the process, not the central topic.
"
Fossils holi jode don habda mangu ko naftireko daga asali ma?,"The best answer is **D: Knuckle Tafiya (Knuckle Walking)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage describes features of the hand and its use in supporting weight, especially mentioning its connection to movement and manipulation.**
*   **Knuckle-walking fits the description** perfectly, where the hands are used to support the body's weight while walking, allowing for a degree of agility and manipulation.
*   The passage speaks of fossils and how they show the evolution of the hand and its function in manipulation.
*   Option A: Bawugo (not relevant to the context of hand function or fossils)
*   Option B: Nonugo teddudum (describes weight-bearing but does not describe a distinct type of movement, and doesn't connect directly to hand function)
*   Option C: Tafiya (generic walking but does not pertain to the distinct walking described in the first paragraph)"
Dume on ha nder majum hollata falanges ngabbu? ,"The correct answer is **A: Fartugo mabbe buri joi innu ndamci’**

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses how hands can manipulate things.
* The passage mentions in passing the number of fingers each hand has.
*   The question asks which statement is relevant to the number of fingers.

The other options are not related to the number of fingers:

*   B: It discusses that the hands are different than the legs and feet.
*   C: It is more focused on using the hands to lift heavy things.
*   D: It is a more broad statement on how hands are useful."
utugo ittan variation Kesum ha genetic?,"The correct answer is **A: Lappi**

Here's why:

* **P: Teffol ha duɓɓi ujeneji noogas holli wadi geeɓeji saanjol asli ɗiɗi: nyukkinga be hollinga. Seduturgo do bedda sabon genetic daban daban, be subtugo do itta dum daga je pool je be vurtini daban daban. Sankutuggo iri senduugo be hautugo bawo be yeeso hakkunde himbe didi je wari daga zamanu fere fere.** translates roughly to: ""Analysis over twenty thousand years shows two main sources of genetic variation: mutation and recombination. Mutation adds new genetic variants, and selection removes them from the gene pool as different variants emerge. Recombination is a type of segregation and combination of past and future between two people from different times.""

* **Q: utugo ittan variation Kesum ha genetic?** translates to: ""What adds new variation to genetics?""

Based on the first sentence, ""Mutation adds new genetic variants"", therefore the answer is **A: Lappi (mutation)**

The other options don't fit:

*   **B: Fuddutugo hautugo (Starting recombination)** - Recombination shuffles existing variation, it doesn't create *new* variation.
*   **C: Sendugo (Segregation)** - Segregation, like recombination, shuffles existing genes.
*   **D: Hulwugo (Selection)** - Selection removes or favors certain genes. It reduces variation, not adds to it."
Lawol toi hani tokka je beddugo genetic variation?,"The passage says ""Teffol ha duɓɓi ujeneji noogas holli wadi geeɓeji saanjol asli ɗiɗi: nyukkinga be hollinga"" which translates to ""Research over twenty thousand years has shown two main sources of genetic variation: mutation and selection.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **C: Mutationn**"
nder habini je wani ha nder kisa dume don yernowo nƴamata nƴibinto bandu?,"Based on the passage, the answer is **A: Hokogu watigu**.

The passage discusses how animals with limited access to amino acids, especially those in harsh environments, obtain protein. It mentions that insects (like termites and larvae) are easily digestible and provide high-quality protein with essential amino acids. This protein is used for strengthening and building the body. So, protein helps building the body by strengthening it.
"
Ha nder kisa ko tokkindiri dou damuwaji toi don waddata sende amino acids jemari daraja?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: sankutugo yamdu ha redu**.

Here's why:

The passage states that animals with a high amino acid requirement struggle to get enough protein from plant matter alone, as plant proteins are difficult to digest. Therefore, **sankutugo yamdu ha redu** (difficulty digesting food) would lead to this amino acid deficiency. The passage goes on to say that insects are easily digested and of high quality amino acids.
"
Noi jamaj e al'ada Fere hsllata kautal hore be jamaje luttube?,"The passage describes how shared culture and similarities bring people together to benefit each other, while differences like age, location, gender, etc., also exist. It emphasizes that people in different groups act differently, use resources differently, speak differently, and so on.

The question asks how different cultures and traditions *hinder* unity with other groups.

*   **A: Fandugo namugo ha nder (Understanding the questions within)** - This is a general statement about understanding questions and doesn't address the barrier to unity.
*   **B: Jabugo halaji komoijo ha hedi mabbe (Accepting the words of experts among them)** - This suggests agreement and acceptance, not a barrier to unity.
*   **C: Jabugo ɗabi'a leddi (Accepting national behavior)** - This relates to national behavior, not directly the cultural differences that hinder unity. While national behavior can sometimes be exclusive, it's not the most direct answer.
*   **D: Naftirgo be fasali ha jamji be haftirtina (Using interpretations to separate and define groups)** - This is the best answer. It implies that interpretations and definitions are used to *separate* and *define* groups, highlighting the *differences* that hinder unity. It directly relates to how cultural understanding (or misunderstanding) can create division.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D**.
"
No kisado hi andal bingel mo wala hakki lo ha der ɲengol wowan mangu anfani to tokkidirigo?,"Based on the context, the best answer is **C: Be ettan bingel mai gam yanayi fere.**

Here's why:

*   The prompt discusses children internalizing biases and potentially acting in discriminatory ways due to what they hear.
*   ""Be ettan bingel mai gam yanayi fere"" translates to ""They try the child for different situations/circumstances."" This suggests exposing the child to diverse perspectives and experiences to counter potential biases and encourage a more understanding worldview.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Bingel man hubdan rena hore mako ha waggo hunde na boddum** (The child should learn to value themselves until they reach something good) - While self-esteem is important, it doesn't directly address the issue of combating learned biases.
*   **B: Bingel man yidi nastina hore mako damuwa** (The child wants to put themselves to sleep) - This is unrelated to the prompt.
*   **D: Bingel man sali hautugo be leddi femari** (The child refuses to unite with the new country) - While potentially relevant in some contexts, it doesn't directly answer the question about dealing with a child who is internalizing biases.

Therefore, option C directly addresses the problem of biased behavior by suggesting a method to expose the child to different perspectives."
No kissada vi andal bingel mo wala hakkilo hader lenyel wowan maugu amfani to tokkidirigo?,"Based on the context of P, which discusses how children are influenced by what they hear and how they might adopt prejudices, the most fitting answer is:

**D: Yanayi Lenyol (YanayI Lenyol)**

**Explanation:**

*   **Pikkon do hefta do ha himbe ifti bo no be wannata himbe gam majum wakkati be do famdi bo do chanji no pikkon watta kujeji.** This means Children acquire behaviors and perceptions from others, influencing how they treat people as they learn and change.
*   The example given in P highlights how children from a certain group might develop prejudices against others based on what they hear, even without personal experience. This indicates a strong influence of the **culture** or **environment** of their community/ethnic group.

Therefore, the most logical connection is that the story of a child's understanding and lack of awareness within a community (Q) would be most useful to explore the **nature/atmosphere of the ethnic group**. This is because the child's biases are shaped by the overall cultural context.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Leddi famari be subbiti be hebtogo:** (Small lands being chosen and acquired) - This is unrelated to the influence of culture and prejudice.
*   **B: Gitko Mabe:** (Their pride) - While pride might be a factor, it's not the central focus of the example provided.
*   **C: Gondol mako be bikkoi fere:** (His companion and other children) - While peers can influence a child, the primary point of P is the broader community influence and the prejudices formed."
Ha nder kissado dume on ko tokkidiri wawata wadugo sosai ha maunogo bengel jai mari feral damuwa?,"Based on the text, the correct answer is **C: Reclusive Tendencies**.

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes that feral children, raised in the wild, develop behaviors similar to animals. This includes being fearful of humans and lacking empathy.

*   Option A, ""Marugo enche hore"" translates to ""Possessing a strong head"" or possibly ""Headstrong."" While feral children might be stubborn, it isn't a defining characteristic described in the passage.

*   Option B, ""Wawugo volde"" is not a known term or phrase in the context of the provided text.

*   Option D, ""Verugo be Shumri"" is also not a known term or phrase in the context of the provided text.

*   **Option C, ""Reclusive Tendencies,"" accurately reflects the behavior of feral children, who are described as avoiding and fearing human contact due to their upbringing.** Therefore, C is the most accurate answer."
"Ha nder kissado, dume on ha nder muka holliti feral gitku bilakoi?","Let's analyze the provided text and the answer options.

The text describes feral children (""fere""), their upbringing, and their behavior. Key points are:

*   Feral children are raised outside of normal human society, often by animals or alone in the wild.
*   They lack human socialization and understanding.
*   Their behavior resembles that of animals.
*   They may be abandoned by their parents because they are seen as mentally deficient.
*   They fear and avoid humans.
*   They imitate the behavior of the animals that raised them (or that surround them if raised alone).

Now, let's look at the answer options:

*   **A: Damatu hader feral gutku on waddata physical impairment** (Damatu under feral gutku leads to physical impairment) - The passage doesn't state anything specific about physical impairments caused by being a feral child, so this is likely incorrect.
*   **B: Feral getku do nyado on to baba en bingel hefti o mari dum lau** (Feral getku, which is eaten by the father and child, has a lot of it) - This doesn't make any sense in relation to the original question. It's unrelated to the concept of feral children.
*   **C: Kara damuwa feral getku do hibe daga damu soide andal** (Kara worries feral getku so they could have their own place) - Again, it is unreadable and irrelevant to the original question.
*   **D: kala hali dabbare fou don heɓe sanaɗi nauɗum fero ngandi** (every animal gets a new way of thinking and behavior) - While feral children may exhibit animalistic behaviors, the important thing here is the concept of an alteration in the child's way of thinking and behavior. Thus, feral children lack social skills as well as human socialization, and their behavior resembles that of animals.

**Therefore, the correct answer is D.**
"
Ko kisa doi dume ha ko tokkindiri do wala nder consistent be subsisitence oriented ha demri?,"The correct answer is **A: Hakilango ha ko remobi yidi ha lenyol**.

Here's why:

*   **Subsistence farming** is about producing enough food for the farmer and their family to survive. Therefore, understanding the needs and preferences (""ko remobi yidi ha lenyol"") of the community is the most consistent and important part.
*   The other answers refer to different aspects but not a core consistent element of subsistence farming
    *   B: Vurtingo nyiri le be sorta himbe (Making and sorting food)
    *   C: Hakilago ha do gete kesum dabaruji (Remembering that they have new technology skills)
    *   D: Fefugo Audi ha kyaye remobi (Giving money to the farmers)

Therefore, the answer is **A**."
Dome on ha nder do jai tendini howugo subsistence agriculture?,"Based on the passage P and the question Q, the correct answer is:

**A: Be pot mabbe, organic system on**

Here's why:

*   The passage describes subsistence agriculture (""Remugo kujeji nyamdu je goɗɗo naftirta be hore mako ko be iyalu mako on ɓe ɗyonata remungo hore"") as simple, traditional farming focused on providing for the farmer's own family. It also hints at its organic nature by mentioning limited external inputs and reliance on natural cycles.
*   Question Q asks how this relates to subsistence agriculture.
*   The key connection is that subsistence farming often involves organic methods because it's focused on self-sufficiency and less reliant on purchased inputs. Organic systems are based around self sufficeny too.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Be naftra kuje gotel on ha katugo audi:** The use of one thing to reduce rainfall is not described in the passage.
*   **C: Remo sanda audi ko te be woni ha ledi:** Although farmers are there to farm the land, this description is too simple and does not fit.
*   **D: Bedo naftira ha remobe ha lesdi jo fere:** The passage mentions historical evidence and says that farmers still grow things for food in developing countries, which is not what this says."
Jahugo museum je mabbitiggo bidi goi ha category toi?,"Based on the provided text and the question:

*   **The text (P) describes ""cultural tourism"" (jahangal al’ada).** It mentions visiting places to see traditions, learn about history, and experience the local culture.
*   **The question (Q) asks where visiting a museum fits.** Museums preserve and display cultural artifacts and historical information.

Therefore, the best answer is:

*   **C: Al'adoji mabutugo (Cultural tourism)**

The other options don't fit as well:

*   A: Vurtugo laru lamu (Governmental tourism) - Not directly related to the definition of the museum provided.
*   B: Pellel jodugo jai mabutugo gete (Museums) - This is a repetition of the place not what the museum is showing
*   D: Outdoor mabutugo (Outdoor tourism) - Museums are generally indoor activities."
Nder kusa do dume wonata ko himbe yoebe maebutugo yani hala?,"Based on the provided text (which appears to be in Fula/Fulani), the best answer is **C: Larugo landmark je mari amfani (Seeing landmarks that have value/are beneficial)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage focuses on cultural tourism, where people visit to experience traditions, learn about history, and see significant places. Landmarks, especially those with cultural or historical significance, are central to this type of tourism.
*   The text mentions that people visit to see their culture and history, and to learn about past events. Landmarks are often physical manifestations of these things.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Hastugo hore mabi ha dabiya kyaye (Putting their heads in nature kyaye):** While nature tourism might be part of the overall tourist experience, the passage specifically emphasizes the cultural aspect of the destination.
*   **B: Hosugo suitare ha kala ko wada ko ndai (Taking suite at all things that they do know):** This doesn't relate to cultural tourism.
*   **D: Tamugo habaruji wakkati sali (Thinking news time went past):** This is also not related to cultural tourism.

Therefore, the focus of the passage on cultural tourism and the importance of seeing culturally significant places makes **C** the most relevant and accurate answer."
Dume on vi ha nder kisa jai valata hulobe chanja ata hulogo ha nder cuce kyaye do?,"Based on the provided text, the answer is **B: Hibugo ha nder himbe yari dabiya kautal hore mabe**. Here's why:

*   **The Text Focus:** The passage emphasizes learning from the experiences of others, understanding their struggles and successes, and using those insights to improve the work environment and achieve goals. The main point is to encourage and inspire others as well as develop trust.
*   **Explanation:** Therefore, building confidence in the people and in their ability to self-organize in the work environment is the best explanation to the text
"
"Nder kissa mai, hebugo hefta habaru goddo vallon be dume?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Ustugo kolo Change** (Reducing fear of change).

The passage states: ""Iri habaru no goɗɗo heɓɓi nasaraku usti kulol saanji, bo wadi himɓe do tamma kuje boɗɗum to be nani hala saanji ha yeeso ɗo."" This directly translates to ""Sharing stories of how others achieved success reduces the fear of change, and makes people expect good things when they hear about change in the future.""
"
Ha nder ko tokkindiri dume on holli duniyaro je en ekkittitto jatta?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is:

**B: Ekkitago wona hado kuje en yardi be kuje en vawi**

Here's why:

*   The passage highlights how people learn through various means - not just formal schooling. It talks about learning through television, practical skills (fixing cars, plumbing), and travel. This suggests that learning isn't limited to formal instruction but happens through experiences and interactions with the world. The passage states ""Wala gotel lawol boddum je ekkutuggo"" - There is no one good way to learn.
*   The passage is critical of formal education, indicating ""Jaangirde aandaal ɗon fe’a on cakka bauɗo jaangungo e ekkitowo"" - Universities separate students from teachers.
*   The passage emphasizes learning from experiences and is critical of formal education. The passage gives examples of learning through different means.

"
Dume nano dai-dai kuje en jangata ha duniyaro jotta?,"Based on the passage, the most relevant and accurate answer is:

**C: Andal je en jaftirta don vodi en dingo ekkitako (Knowledge we accept leads us to not learning).**

Here's why:

*   The passage criticizes passively accepting information (e.g., from TV) instead of actively learning and experiencing things.
*   It highlights a decline in practical skills (fixing cars, plumbing).
*   The author implies that relying on readily available information hinders true learning and personal growth.
*   **Option C** best reflects this sentiment by stating that simply accepting knowledge without active engagement prevents true learning.

The other options are not as directly supported by the text:

*   **A:** While the passage mentions that there's no perfect method of teaching, it does not directly state that nothing is being learned.
*   **B:** The text criticizes the current methods of teaching and the passive acceptance of information.
*   **D:** This option is unclear."
Daga to a ummi ha wakkati doidi domi'in damete ha wakkati mai?,"Based on the information in P, the correct answer is **C: Yenfugo alerm shaka jemma kuma mintiji nogas fa'in a lori doydi (Setting an alarm clock for about 20 minutes before you usually need to urinate)**.

Here's why:

*   The text mentions that you can train yourself to urinate on a schedule, potentially by waking up during the night to urinate.
*   The advice includes setting an alarm before you usually wake up so you can empty your bladder, thus leading to a more consistent schedule.

The other options don't align as directly with the provided information:

*   A and B relate to things to avoid.
*   D relates to consuming fluids."
Ha nder ko tokkindiri do dome on nana ko nastin tama ha dogdi?,"Based on the provided text (P), the correct answer is **B: Kuje mai nana jai a umminta hore matu**

Here's why:

*   The passage talks about setting an alarm and preparing things to help someone wake up and use the bathroom, implying assistance in getting up is needed. It relates to what happens when someone initially wakes up from sleep.

The other options are not explicitly suggested in the text:

*   A: It does not talk about biorhythm in general.
*   C: It does not say anything about the things that are mentioned being cheap.
*   D: It does not specify the time when the person wakes up."
Hore fodi liquid koidol ko ndume on bedi?,"Based on the provided text, the question ""Hore fodi liquid koidol ko ndume on bedi?"" translates to ""Why does slow-wave sleep matter?"" or ""Why is slow-wave sleep important?"".

The passage mentions that during sleep, the body recovers. It also states REM sleep is important.

The closest option that captures the essence of the importance of sleep and recovery is:

*   **C: Jatugo je recovery states** (Meaning ""Importance of recovery states"")

Therefore, the best answer is **C**."
Ha nder ko tokkindiri dome damuwa lucid todo toida ha nder bandu?,"Based on the provided text, the answer is **A: Ustugo wakkati wa chska REM states**.

Here's why:

The text states that having few REMs each night can negatively impact your ability to process information, making it difficult to focus, similar to the effect of watching TV for 20-30 minutes after waking up. Therefore, the question ""What among the following contributes to lucid dreaming?"" can be accurately correlated with shortened REM sleep stages.
"
Nder kisa do noi himbe hauti be himbe jai be ya'eta woni?,"Based on the passage (P) which discusses the characteristics of effective teamwork despite not being co-located, the best answer is:

**B: be pat mabe hani wona ko dume go'o jai hore mabe kala konde**

Here's why:

*   **Passage P Emphasis:** The passage highlights the importance of shared purpose, alignment, and individual contribution toward a common goal. It states that members are more likely to work together when their purposes are aligned and they recognize the importance of each individual's contribution.
*   **Option B Alignment:** This option translates to ""all of them should have the same purpose, everyone understanding their role."" This aligns directly with the importance of shared purpose and individual contributions highlighted in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Hani be howa kugal dedai** (They should do work differently) - This contradicts the idea of aligned efforts.
*   **C: be pat be yehi ha jogordo mo ye'a duke** (They all go to the leader to ask for permission) - This implies a hierarchical structure and dependence on a leader, which isn't the focus of the passage on self-managed or aligned teams.
*   **D: be pat be hadi wa wakkati go'o** (They all had an appointment at the same time) - This is about scheduling and not about the core principles of effective teamwork.
Therefore, the best answer is **B**."
Nder kisa do dume on ha hala wai volwata physical be virtual jai nane gogonba?,"Based on the provided passage (P) and question (Q), the most appropriate answer is **A: kautal himbe mai ko dai don hauti ha pellel beddum** (The collection of people always comes together in a different place).

Here's why:

* **Question Q asks:** ""In essence, what is being discussed when talking about physical and virtual teams?""
* **Passage P discusses:**
    * How teams can function even without physical proximity.
    * The importance of shared goals in virtual teams.
    * The challenges of trust and communication in virtual teams.
    * The potential for virtual teams to accomplish tasks effectively.

Answer A directly relates to the core concept of the difference between physical and virtual teams - the location of the team members.
"
Ha nder kisa dou dume nana ko wala nder theories jai saka?,"Based on the passage you provided, the most relevant answer is:

*   **D: andugo hunde je himbe yidi** (Understanding what people want)

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the topic of understanding people's motivations and what influences their actions. It discusses theories that deal with human needs and desires, like Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory. All of this points to the central idea of figuring out what people want and why they do what they do.

The other options are not as directly related to the main theme of the passage:

*   **A: kuje kesum ko a yedi wakaati o bingel** (New things that a child sees) - While new experiences can influence a person, the passage is not specifically focused on early childhood development.
*   **B: Noi pelel a woni waditama dumawa ha kowata** (The way a place is set up) - The physical environment can play a role, but the passage emphasizes internal desires and motivations.
*   **C: ko a yedi ha yasi** (Things that you see) - While external observations might provide insights, the main point is about understanding internal needs and motivations."
Nde ko tokkindiri do dume wala kuje mari rule ha tati?,"Based on the first sentence of the passage ""Hudugo be salugo gonga doka je tati huyi wadugo sai a resa majun ha hoto,"" which translates to ""To follow the rule of thirds in photography, you need to place key elements in the photo along the lines,"" the correct answer is:

**C: resugo kuje ha pele ko hani be beddum** (Placing key elements at the intersection points)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: wadugo a layije bodum jai nana kuje jai rule jai tati** (Creating a good story about certain things by the rule of thirds) - While good composition can help tell a story, the primary function of the rule of thirds is not story-telling.
*   **B: wadugo rayuwa be njamu nder hoto** (Adding life and vibrancy to the photo) - The rule of thirds helps with composition, which can contribute to a more vibrant photo, but it isn't the direct purpose.
*   **D: wadugo be wala godom ha hoto** (Creating with nothing else in the photo) - This doesn't relate to the rule of thirds at all."
Dume hai nder do jai nana koi holiyi 35mm photography format?,"The correct answer is **D: kamjum pn be buri naftirgo ha duniya** (It is the most widely used format in the world).

The passage states ""A misalu, foto 35mm on buri dudugo ha duniyaaru..."" which translates to ""For example, 35mm photography is the most widely used in the world..."". Therefore, option D is the only option that directly reflects the information provided in the passage.
"
ha nder kisa do wadobe kuje do bedder sembe ha feyugo kare ha zoom lenses yaha yeso?,"Based on the provided text (P), the following points are made about zoom lenses:

*   They have more optical complexity because they need to cover a range of focal lengths, unlike prime lenses.
*   Zoom lenses often have smaller maximum apertures (smaller ""doggudu majum"") than prime lenses. This reduces the amount of light that can enter.
*   Zoom lenses can be useful for people with certain eye conditions or situations where changing lenses isn't practical.

Now, let's analyze the options in relation to the question (Q), which asks about the downsides of zoom lenses compared to fixed (prime) lenses:

*   **A: be mari dogugo sosai (They have a small aperture)** - This aligns with the text stating that zoom lenses typically have smaller apertures. This is a DISADVANTAGE.
*   **B: be mara bone ha naftiriko babal yete dudayi (They have more distortion, especially at the edges)** - While this is a possibility in some zoom lenses, the provided text doesn't specifically mention it as a general disadvantage compared to prime lenses.
*   **C: hoto mari be mabe sembe jai nandi be lenses jai be wati ha focal lenght (They don't have the same image quality as lenses fixed at a focal length)** - This is generally true due to the increased complexity of zoom lens designs. Prime lenses can be optimized for a single focal length, allowing for better image quality. The text indirectly hints at this with the statement about optical complexity.
*   **D: be wodiyi focal complexity be wakaati lenses (They have focal complexity with wide lenses)** - This is not a downside; it's a characteristic of zoom lenses.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: be mari dogugo sosai (They have a small aperture)**, This means that zoom lenses let in less light than fixed lenses."
ha nder do dume on vurtinta lens jai hani wuna ha wakaati lens?,"Based on the passage (P), the answer is **D: to a laral sosai ha focal complexity.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Matsala lensji zum kanjum on fokal komplekzity man bo be ɗuuɗugo element lens je ko mari haaje yotta renj fokal lent ɓuri praim lens ɗuɗugo.""  This translates to: ""Zoom lenses' challenge is their focal complexity, and needing more lens elements to achieve a range of focal lengths is greater than a prime lens.""

This directly links focal complexity with zoom lenses being more challenging and needing more elements. Therefore, if you're looking for something that distinguishes a zoom lens, its focal complexity is a key characteristic.
"
Je toi nder ɗo waddata ko salititta jamhuriyaaji je mari fere-fere be iga luttaano Moldova ?  ,"Based on the provided text, the answer is **A: Yaare**.

The passage states that in 1994, there was a secessionist conflict leading to the formation of the Transnistria Republic within Moldova. This republic has its own government and currency, but importantly, it is **unrecognized** by the UN, meaning it's not acknowledged as a legitimate independent territory. This ""unrecognition"" is a key element of the question, meaning the main reason for the split is territory/area. Therefore, ""Yaare"" (area/territory) is the best answer.
"
"No wardi, ndei yahata jahagal montevidiyo to ɗo tamma selan wakkati hindu ?","Based on the passage, Montevideo experiences summer when the sun's rays reach 30°C. Summer in the Southern Hemisphere (where Montevideo is located) corresponds to winter in the Northern Hemisphere (Fuuna Hemisphere). Therefore, the answer is:

**C: Wakkati fuuna Hemisphere lebbi jaagol** (Time of the Northern Hemisphere winter)
"
"No wardi, ndei yahata jahagal montevidiyos to ɓeɗo sendiri wakkati pewol ?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Ndei on wakkati gulɗum ha montevidiyos**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Montevideo experiences a subtropical climate with hot summers.
*   The question asks what happens in Montevideo during periods of intense cold.
*   Therefore, the opposite of cold must be the hot time."
"No wardi, je toi der ɗo hautata be kosɗe diidol bindi, gaigu daw vonnuro ?","Based on the provided text (P), graffiti is described as vandalism and the inappropriate use of public spaces.  Considering the options:

*   **A: Mufgal bindi (Vandalism)** - This aligns with the negative description of graffiti in the text.
*   **B: hautugo kalmaji (combining words)** - While graffiti can contain words, the text emphasizes the *misuse* of public space, not the art of combining words.
*   **C: Ɗabi’a boɗɗum ha kuje ummatoore (Good behavior to the community)** - This is the opposite of what the text implies about graffiti.
*   **D: Tag je hadai (forbidden things)** - This aligns with the fact that Graffiti is generally seen as vandalism and not accepted by the community.

The best answers, considering the text's focus on the negative aspects of graffiti, are **A: Mufgal bindi and D: Tag je hadai**. Since I can only chose one answer based on your prompt, I would go with **A: Mufgal bindi** as a more accurate option, as the graffiti are perceived as vandalistic and not in acceptance by the community.
"
Al’amari toi je bambu je ɓe warata waɗata la’akari be nafu a geɓe bawɓe?,"The correct answer is **D: Nastugo be lau** (Getting in early).

Here's why:

* **P (The prompt)** describes a situation where many people attend a music festival. It explicitly states that if you want a good spot, you need to arrive early to secure a place near the stage.
* **Q (The question)** asks what people do to benefit or take advantage of the situation.
* **A (Waddugo ɓukkoi pamaron - Bringing small children):** While families attend, this isn't about *benefiting* from the festival, it's just describing who's there.
* **B (Pellel hirde ha tun - Eating on the sand):** Eating is unrelated to the question being asked.
* **C (Gemol ɗo feja ha caka jimma - Playing music in the middle of the night):** Playing music is a part of the festival but irrelevant to getting value out of a situation.
* **D (Nastugo be lau - Getting in early):** This directly answers the question. By arriving early, people secure a better spot, which is the benefit the prompt mentions.

Therefore, arriving early (D) is the action people take to get the most out of the music festival experience.
"
"No wardi, ko hadi mo yahata ɓangal ɓura hukkogo sembe ha daw to ɓeyi latugo a dab be baabal gemol mai?","Based on the context of passage P, which emphasizes arriving early to secure a space, the best answer is:

**D: Nastugo be lau (Entering early)**

Here's why:

*   **Passage P explicitly states that to get a good spot at the concert (kombi babal), you need to arrive early (a yahi lau).**
*   The other options don't directly address the issue of securing a spot:

    *   A: Hotugo ha jimma jinga (Drinking at the tavern) - While maybe related to socializing around the event, it doesn't help secure a spot.
    *   B: Juude ha baabal ngam lenyol (Praying for a space for the clan) - It doesn't directly help to secure a space for you
    *   C: Waɗugo pellel hirde ha yaasi (Making a space for grazing outside) - This is irrelevant to the context of a concert.
"
"No wardi, Hatoi koɗo selata to ɗo tefa ngedamjimma ha fuuna Mexico kesum ?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Pueblos**.

The text directly states: ""Andugo no Pueblos do nyukki, a hebata himbe do wanca..."" which translates to ""Knowing that the Pueblos are close, you can find people who wander...""
"
"No wardi, Hatoi on koɗo banta ɓurata hiɓugo nishaɗiiji andiiɗum a fuuna Mexico kesum ?","Based on the passage, the most likely correct answer is:

**D: Ha Gurel-petel baabal yarugo mbal**

Here's why:

*   **The passage warns against small town bars:** It states, ""Sei hakkila; sare baal ha wuro do vodai sosai kodo ta yaha babeji do."" (Be careful; the bars in small towns are very different and you shouldn't go to just any place).
*   **It further mentions the issue of ""masala lanyugo wala nder hakkilo"" (problems with drinking and lack of common sense) and uncontrolled bar fights:** It states, ""Je kuje gotel, mkziko kesum je noth ɗo mari masala lanyugo wala nder hakkilo, bo himɓe je wala nder hakkilo maɓɓe duɗɗum ɗo kombi babal yarugo bal je wuro petel"" (For one thing, New Mexico has problems with drinking and lack of common sense, and people without common sense often get into bar fights in small town bars).

The other options are less likely to provide a fun and safe experience based on the provided information:

*   **A: Iga Ci’e fijigo caca awaaji ɗIɗi iga Albuquerque & C: Ha Ci’e fijigo caca kombi Sante Fe:** The passage does mention that casinos near Albuquerque and Santa Fe have entertainment, but it doesn't specifically highlight them as the *best* way to have fun while staying safe. The casinos are also a bit away from those cities.
*   **B: Ha rimot pueblos:** While Pueblos are mentioned, there is no implication that they would be the best way to find safe and controlled entertainment.
"
Sendunki chede waɗooɓe jahaali yelan sela ha njaram toi ?,"Based on the provided text, the question ""Sendunki chede waɗooɓe jahaali yelan sela ha njaram toi?"" translates to something like ""Which drink is popular in Australia?"".

The text states: ""Ni yimɓe Australia, hala shayi danejum tan kuje yaasi on."" This translates to ""For the people of Australia, only white tea is consumed."" Therefore, the correct answer is:

A: Mbal Australia
"
"Dau baabal tindinaama ha bendi mai, je toi nder njaram ummraaki banta saklan tukki ?","The passage focuses on different types of drinks. Let's break down the relevant parts to answer the question:

*   **P:** The text mentions ""Bal be buri yarugo ‘Number One',"" which means the ""Number One"" is a drink.

*   **Q:** The question asks what the passage describes as ""the drink with the greatest origin."" Given the limited context, ""origin"" seems to imply how the drink first was consumed.

Based on these points, the correct answer would be ""B: Ha lamba aran""

**Explanation**

*   The passage introduces the drinks with ""Number One,"" suggesting it is the primary and therefore the one with the greatest beginning.

The other options are less relevant because:

*   **Ha dammuɗum ɓalejum:** this translates to ""the black color"" and refers to espresso, not the drink with greatest origin.
*   **Ha Sauvignon blane iga New Zealand:** this is a type of wine, but it is not introduced first.
*   **Ha Takkiga daneejum:** this translates to ""White Tea"", which is described as ""just tea"", and not the primary drink."
"Ɗo juuɗa je lesɗi tati, wakkati laamu maral fuɗɗaama be mufgal toi ?","The correct answer is **D: Himɓe Espanya**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Daga wakkati be wadi Asuncion ha 1537, Paraguay habdi siga duddum daga alqaida mabbe.""

* This translates to: ""Since the time they made Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has defended itself considerably from their bases.""

* ""Their bases"" are a reference to ""Himbe Spain fuddi laamugo himbe bo timmai ha bawo temere taati.""

* Therefore ""Ɗo juuɗa je lesɗi tati, wakkati laamu maral fuɗɗaama be mufgal toi?"" = ""Where the control of the land began with who's move?""

The Spanish are the ones who initiated control and displacement.
"
"No wardi ha bindi mai, ɗatal toi ɓuri ha heɓugo parisa en ha wulina be ma ?","Based on the passage, the best way to be accepted in Paris is to be polite and well-mannered. Therefore, the most suitable answer is:

*   **A: Foodu ekkituggo gekku parisa en (Try to learn the ways/culture of Parisians)**

The passage emphasizes understanding and adopting the Parisian way of being ""bien élevé.""
"
"No wardi ha bindi mai, jetoi on nafterta ha campi himɓe parisa en ?","Based on the text provided (P), the key idea is that Parisians dislike being seen as ashamed or lacking in social graces. It suggests that to make friends in Paris, one should avoid presumptuous talk and act ""well-mannered."" Thus, the answer that best reflects what Parisians avoid displaying is **B: Soide semteede** (lack of shame).
"
Ɗume nafu aran noode ha Cape Town metro juude ?,"Based on the provided text (P), the correct answer is **B: Na ba himɓe ɗuɗɗum**.

The text states ""Metroplos man ɓuri welugo bo himɓe ɗuuɗai..."". This directly translates to ""Metroplus is more expensive but has more people..."".  Therefore, a key advantage of Metroplus is that it caters to a larger number of people.
"
"No wardi ha bindi mai, ɗume on ko moi watta jahagal jirgi leddi ha Cape Town mari ？","Based on the text provided, the correct answer is:

**D: Fu aran be tataɓel nooniiji fu**

The passage states:

*   ""Metrorail do mari aji didi ha jirgi leddi je yahata warta der be ko tari wuro Cape Town: Metroplus ( be do dyona dum aji je aranere) be Metro ( be do dyona dum aji je tatabo).""

This translates to: ""Metrorail has two classes of trains that go to and from Cape Town: Metroplus (called the first class) and Metro (called the third class).""

Therefore, Cape Town trains have first and third class options."
Je toi nder ɗo ɗum kowowe dabbaji je hadai waɗa ?,"Based on the passage:

*   The passage discusses the dangers of certain animals living in homes.
*   It mentions animals that can cause harm, disease, or fear.

Option D, ""Daasi naunandi sembi"" (Preventing strong attacks), aligns with the passage's concern about animals harming or attacking people.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Daasi naunandi sembi**."
Hatoi hiɓata kati waya je arti woɓi?,"Based on the context provided, the correct answer is:

**D: Ha waya yoɓiiga** (In payphones)

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses using phones, obtaining numbers to scam people into paying for damaged lines, and the fact that this practice is more common in some countries than others.
*   Payphones are a place where someone could potentially use a phone belonging to someone else (by using a phone card or collecting dropped change) or make anonymous calls. The practice is also easier to perpetuate without being tracked.
*   The other options do not connect as logically to the explanation in the prompt.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D**."
Noi on koiɗum nodduki ha katiiji fere ɗo ?,"The correct answer is **D: Be nafurgo waya woɓiiga be beddugo ha daw**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) is describing phone fraud.** It mentions using stolen phone credit or hacking into other people's phone lines to make calls that someone else pays for.  It also mentions obtaining phone numbers used to commit fraud and steal money.

* **The question (Q) asks how these criminals make calls to other countries.**

* **Option D (Be nafurgo waya woɓiiga be beddugo ha daw - ""By using other people's phone lines and connecting to other networks"")** directly addresses how the fraudulent calls are made: by using someone else's phone lines or resources. This fits the description of phone hacking and stolen phone credit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ɓe maran lawol ha lesɗiiji fere tan - ""They have access to only certain countries"")** This doesn't explain *how* they are making the calls.
* **B: Gal lamba chede nastata - ""Without a credit card number"")** This is about payment methods, not how the phone calls are routed.
* **C: Ha celal siga - ""By a certain signal"")** This is too vague and doesn't explain the fraudulent activity.

Therefore, **D** is the best answer.

Therefore, spruce and fir are mentioned as being found at Plitvice Lakes.  The best answer from the provided choices is:

* **D: Leggal spruce**
"
Je toi nder ɗo ɗuɗai fauna wawan heɓa ha Mayo Plitvice siutari je leddi ?,"The correct answer is **D: Capercaillie**.

The passage states: ""...dabbaji leddi je dudai bana bear europe bodejum, bosaru ladde, eagle, owl, lynx, faturu ladde be **capercaillie** don ha totton..."" which translates to ""...common land animals like the brown European bear, wild boar, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat, and **capercaillie** are found there...""

The other options are not mentioned as fauna found in Plitvice Lakes National Park within the provided text.
"
"No wardi ha bindi mai, ɗume on nukkure ka’idaaji asli wallata be ?","Based on the passage, the most relevant answer is **B: Andugo luumo** (Understanding the market).

The passage emphasizes that giving companies power helps them protect their ""luumo maɓɓe"" (their market). It also mentions the benefits of this protection, like the monetary value. Therefore, market knowledge is closely tied to the text's main idea.
"
"No wardi ha bindi mai, je toi nder ɗo ɗum feuri on dau ka’idaaji nukkure je ruman ha habaruuji kamfani ?","Based on the passage P, the focus is on companies protecting their intellectual property and preventing illegal copying of their software (codes, disks, etc.). The consequence of this is protecting their revenue and market share.

Therefore, the best answer is:

*   **C: Ɗo valla ha chede yerlugo (It helps with revenue generation/preservation)**

Let's look at why the other options are less fitting:

*   **A: Ɗo haadi ha hiɓugo luumo hakkilta (It helps to protect market share)** - While protecting IP *does* help protect market share, the direct and immediate result mentioned in the passage is financial benefit to the company.
*   **B: Ɗo valla hada hoosugo ko haadai (It helps prevent illegal copying)** - This is a *means* to the end, not the end itself. The passage explains *why* preventing illegal copying is important.
*   **D: Ɗo valla ha silugo windutuggo je hadai (It helps to legalize illegal activities)** - The passage does not talk about making anything legal."
"To aɗo warta wuro danyol ma, tsariwol toi hadai ?","Based on the provided text fragments, here's the breakdown to determine the most likely correct answer:

*   **P:** This seems to be describing a situation involving returning to one's homeland (leddi mon). It mentions things that one might encounter (kugal, bote) and the importance of knowing one's abilities and limitations.
*   **Q:** This is a question that translates to ""When you return to your hometown, what will you bring?""

Now let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Ɗo valla ha hisnugo wujjugo fasahaaji (Protecting against the loss of wealth):** This aligns with the idea of bringing resources or having wealth to protect upon returning home.

*   **B: Ayyinki kuje (Material things)** This answer is also closely related because most people bring material things back to their homeland

*   **C: Je shari’a kerol kuje (Islamic law restricts things):** This could be relevant in some contexts, especially if the return is to a place where Islamic law is strictly enforced, but it's less generally applicable than option A.

*   **D: Kwastom hakkilni (Customs attention):** This could be relevant if the return journey involves crossing international borders, but it's not necessarily related to what one would bring.

**Conclusion**

The most appropriate answer from the provided options is **B: Ayyinki kuje (Material things)** because that is the most normal thing people carry back home.
"
Toi on nder ɗo haa di a anda bako a yotta nder wuro ndaigol maɗa?,"Based on the provided context, the most likely correct answer is **C: To lattan ɗon kwastom hakkinooɓe**.

Here's why:

*   **Context Clues:** The passage P talks about arriving at a place, potentially a country or border (""leddi mon""). It mentions the importance of being aware of what you can and cannot bring.
*   **Question Q:** Asks about reaching your destination.
*   **Customs Relevance:** ""Kwastom hakkinooɓe"" translates to ""customs officials"" or ""vigilant customs."" Customs officials are responsible for inspecting goods entering a country to ensure compliance with laws and regulations.

Let's break down why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Baabal lenyugo nastu vurtu** - This refers to immigration documents, which are important, but the passage focuses more on what you're *bringing* than your entry documents.
*   **B: To ayiɗi a wangena kare daw kerol shariya** - This has to do with legal issues related to the border, but the passage is more general about being aware of what's allowed and not allowed.
*   **D: To ko toi kare a waddata nder wala yerduye** - It is important to declare the items you are bringing with you to the officials.

**Therefore, option C is the most appropriate response in the given scenario.**"
"No wardi ha bindi mai, ɗuɗɗum ko accata fa’ugo sosai-sosai heɓi kesum daw Cochamó Valley ?","Based on the context of the passage, the correct answer is **A: Ra'ayiiji**.

The passage talks about people coming from all over the world to discover new trails and adventures in the Cochamo Valley. ""Ra'ayiiji"" (which likely translates to ""ideas"" or ""inspirations"" in the relevant language) best fits this context as the reason why people are increasingly discovering Cochamo Valley. The valley offers new ideas and experiences for those seeking adventure.

"Daw ko habaru hukki ha bindi mai, je maɓɓi ko ɓuri eɓɓugo ha Hirna Hemisphere ?","The passage discusses air travel in the South Pacific. It mentions that LATAM (a member of Oneworld) is the only airline that can reliably fly from South America (Santiago De Chile) to the South Pacific (Tahiti) and onwards to western South America.

Therefore, the answer that is most relevant and accurately reflects the passage is:

**D: LATAM Duniyarugotel** (LATAM Air Travel)

The other options are unrelated to the content of the passage:

*   **A: Mufgal duule (Cloud computing):** Irrelevant to the topic.
*   **B: Sobiraago koode (Code sharing):** While code sharing *could* be tangentially related to airline alliances, it's not the *main* point of the passage nor is it specifically highlighted.
*   **C: Hirna joode jam (Western peace conference):** Irrelevant to the topic."
Je firawal toi sobiri ko maɓɓi siɗɗa nder mayo eɓɓata ha Hirna Hemisphere?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **C: LATAM Duniyarugotel**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that LATAM, a Oneworld alliance member, has the advantage in the South Pacific region because it's the only airline that can readily access it from western South America.
*   The question asks which airline has a significant presence in the Western Hemisphere concerning access to the South Pacific.

Therefore, LATAM is the best answer because the text explicitly mentions its role and access in that area."

Therefore, the best answer from the provided options is:

A: Doggogu Copenhagen

"No wardi ha bindi mai, Yihu ha Ganci maɓɓutuggo gete vallan hauta be fere-fere kungiyaaji je tsera ?","The correct answer is **D: Tati**

The text mentions four cities: Barcelona, Copenhagen, and Prague (there is a fourth implied with ""lesde nai"" meaning ""four countries""). But the question is asking which city is the third city in the text i.e. Prague. So, there are *three* cities specifically named before mentioning a fourth unnamed country."

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that cheetahs and other predators are sometimes difficult to spot, and binoculars (""kuje ewugo dayuɗum"") can help you see them better.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **A: Waɗe yadu daw safari** (Make a safari tour): While a safari tour is relevant, the passage specifically links binoculars to improving your chances of seeing animals like cheetahs.
*   **B: Waɗe yadu laddi** (Make a bush walk): Bush walks are mentioned, but they're not specifically related to the challenge of spotting cheetahs.
*   **D: Hosu moota nafturu ha misalu kare kugal** (Take a car ride for example in a work car): While it could be a possibility to go with a vehicle with the assumption you are using it professionally, that is an assumption on the users end, the best option is to spot them with binoculars on an organized and structured Safari tour which uses binoculars."
"Daw ko vindi, dambawa toi koɗo wawan futta ha jahagal safari ha va’orde ?","Based on the provided text, none of the given options are directly mentioned as something that can be encountered on a safari. However, using some logical deduction, we can arrive at the most likely answer. The passage discusses animals like elephants and giraffes, and also mentions predators.

*   **A: Baba ladde** - This translates to ""lion"" in the language of the text.
*   **B: Giraffe** - A giraffe is mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Donyirgal** - We don't have enough information from the prompt to know what Donyirgal translates to.
*   **D: Cheetah** - This is a fast predator.

Considering the context of a safari and the animals that are typically associated with it, a ""Baba ladde"" (Lion) is the best answer. Therefore:

**Answer: A**"
"No wardi ha bindi mai, ɗume on ustata chede ganci maɓɓutuggo gete ?","Based on the passage (P), the best way to reduce transportation costs seems to be:

*   **D: Tefugo mufgal je himɓe jego ko koɓuri (Finding a vehicle for six people or more)**

The passage explicitly mentions taking a larger vehicle (for four people going together, but wanting six people's worth of value), filling it up, and essentially making a deal for a better price. This suggests that maximizing the occupancy of a vehicle is key to reducing individual costs, even if it means partnering with other people.

*   The goal is to reduce individual expenses and potentially deceive people into paying more.

Now let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Ganci maɓɓutuggo gete yelan be mootaaji** - This translates to ""Saving money related to cars."" This aligns directly with the primary theme of the passage.
*   **B: Mufgal je himɓe taati** - This translates to ""Sharing with three people."" It mentions sharing, but doesn't capture the essence of saving money or deception.
*   **C: Sobiraaɓe ɗo waɗida jahagal** - This translates to ""Friends doing business together."" This might be part of the context, but not the central idea.
*   **D: Mufgal je himɓe joy** - This translates to ""Sharing with five people."" It mentions sharing, but doesn't capture the essence of saving money or deception.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is:

**A: Ganci maɓɓutuggo gete yelan be mootaaji**"
"No wardi ha bindi mai, ɗime on walliti andan San Francisco ha duniyaru fuu?","Based on the provided text, the best answer is **C: Hakkilgo fu** (Understanding everything).

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses multiple factors that contribute to San Francisco's global recognition: diverse population, strong economy, arts and culture, tourist attractions, and culinary scene (especially Asian cuisine).

*   Understanding all these elements together gives a comprehensive picture of why San Francisco is well-known globally. Other options only focus on a subset of these reasons."
"No wardi ha bindi mai, volde toi nder ɗo daw San Francisco na gonga ?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Nyamdu Asian ɗo gaati** (Asian food is easily accessible).

The passage states: ""San Francisco do dar gotel ha dar boɗɗum babeji ha dat duniyaru hado luttuɗum kuri Asie: himɓe Kore, Thai, Inde, be Japan"" (San Francisco has excellent restaurants featuring diverse cuisines, especially Asian: Korean, Thai, Indian, and Japanese). This indicates that Asian food is readily available and of good quality in San Francisco.
"
"No wardi ha bindi mai, waɗuwo jahagal toi on nafata be nafturgo hakkilnowo jahali ?","Based on the passage, here's why the best answer is:

* **D: Jahagal mo ɓuri yerdugo be nangugo (Jahagal that is more accommodating and accepting)**

The passage emphasizes how the travel advisor/agent helps in many ways:

*   **Understanding Requirements:** They figure out what documentation is needed for travel to various destinations.
*   **Problem-Solving:** They help if you're in trouble and need new documents or have other issues.
*   **Planning and Flexibility:** They offer solutions and assistance for your journey.
*   **Personalized Advice:** They tailor their assistance to your specific needs.

All of these point to a service that is flexible, understanding, and willing to work with different situations. Options A, B and C don't summarize those core characteristics.

Thus, **D** best captures the core function of this type of travel assistance, as they provide the most comprehensive support and adapt to individual traveler needs."
Je toi nder ɗo limtaaka ha daw ko nafata a nangugo jahagal gal halkinooɓe?,"Based on the provided text, the answer is **D: Jogugo baabal siga (Having a passport).**

Here's why:

The text says ""Ɓe wawan bo'o ɓe jogga sigorde ni ma to a ɗon mari haaje wakkati a numa hala do caahu mala ko a hokka ɗereji feere je baabal a yahata( bana visa)."" This translates to ""They can also keep your passport in case you need it when you are thinking about a problem or to give other documents that your passport is valid for (like a visa).""

The passage explicitly states that having a passport (baabal siga) is something the consultants *might* hold on to, if needed for visa purposes or in case of problems. Thus, it's something related to facilitating travel/consultation. The other options are not directly linked to the services described.
"
"No wardi ha bindi mai, dei on wakkati asli je fassirowo bindi tefugo heɓata?","Based on the provided text, the most accurate answer is:

**B: Fassirki bindi fu ha kuje nafturgo be waya zamanu** (Translation of text from one language to another via online tools.)

Here's why:

*   **P** talks about the ability to use online tools like Google Translate to convert languages.
*   **Q** asks about the accuracy of doing this online in recent times.
*   Therefore, the answer should reflect the capability to convert language using online tools in modern times.
"
Ko accata fassirki waɗa na dau yanar gizo?,"Based on the provided text (P), the answer is **C: Jippunki kuje yaareeji**.

The text states that Google Translate allows you to translate spoken language, even when you're offline, *if* you download the language you want. This directly corresponds to downloading language packs (""jippunki kuje yaareeji"").
"
Je toi nder ɗo dasa vonnuro ndiyam?,"Based on the provided text (P) and the question (Q), the correct answer is:

**B: Himɓe**

Here's why:

*   The text (P) states ""...yake fere bo **himɓe** on dasata ɗum"" which translates to ""and sometimes **people** cause it"".

The question (Q) asks, ""Je toi nder ɗo dasa vonnuro ndiyam?"" which translates to ""Who causes the water disturbance?"".

Therefore, ""Himɓe"" (People) is the correct answer."
"No wardi ha bindi mai, je toi nder ɗo waran les ha bonurda ndiyam?","Based on the information provided, the correct answer is likely **A: Jippurde na be Sawoore**.

Here's why:

*   **P: Kankara na deydey ba; tekkugo baabal watan jogga tan be hakkilo, be to salitini ɗum wartan du jippita je kankaraji may.** - This roughly translates to: ""Ice is melting; the weight of the sea is held only by the wisdom (or intelligence), if it becomes salty it will start dropping its icebergs."" This suggests that the melting ice is caused by the salt in the sea.
*   **Q: No wardi ha bindi mai, je toi nder ɗo waran les ha bonurda ndiyam?** - This translates to: ""What happens in this situation, which affects the water bodies?""

Given the context that melting icebergs/ice sheets are occurring due to salt and wisdom and are affecting water bodies, the most relevant consequence is the increase in sea level. Therefore, ""Jippurde na be Sawoore"" which means ""Dropping is on the Sea"" fits the cause-and-effect relationship implied.

The other options are less directly related:

*   **B: Jippurde na be SawooreSaliti ha jippurde**: ""Dropping is on the Sea Salt in the drop"". It's more of a repetition of the cause of the problem.
*   **C: Mallimalluje ɗuɗɗi dow babal man**: ""Many glaciers on the sea"". This doesn't directly answer the question of what happens as a *result* of the melting.
*   **D: Mallimalluje accaama memaaka iga himɓe**: ""Glaciers left untouched by humans"". While perhaps tangentially relevant, it doesn't directly address the immediate impact on the water.

**Therefore, A is the most direct and logical answer, as it describes the consequence of the melting ice described in the passage.**"
"No wardi ha bindi mai, curry dum je be naftita haa toi nder ɗow?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Kosam be ndeyam**.

The passage mentions that in northern India and Pakistan, they use milk in curries, and in southern India, where the climate is different, they use coconut milk. This indicates that milk and coconut milk are used in curries, varying depending on the region.
"
"Haa wuroji fere, ndiiyam kwakwa ɗum kuje ɓe naftirta haa babal nyamdu je curry?","Based on the provided text, the answer is **C: Kosam**.

The text specifically mentions that in northern India and Pakistan, they use milk in curries, and in southern India and other parts of the country, they use coconut milk. Therefore, ""kosam"" (milk) is the correct answer.
"
Ko waɗi wailititta ha transantarctic hosere ɗo mari haji hiddai yotta ha baabal je ɗo towi?,"The correct answer is **C: Darjiɗai tirato bawɓe**.

Here's why:

*   **P** states that the south pole traverse route of 1600km is long because it follows the Transantarctic mountains to reach the geographic South Pole.

*   The question asks why the Transantarctic mountain makes it difficult to reach the pole.

*   **C** best describes this, as the mountains are a significant terrain obstacle.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: McMordu pellel ɗo maɓɓi:** While McMurdou is a starting point, the question is about difficulty created by the Transantarctic mountains.
*   **B: Babal shuddi man do hulni:** The main challenge is not snow blindness
*   **D: Ɓuri hoyugo jahagal dau gal mayo teku:** Traveling on the ice shelf is not a challenge but an option."
"Gal hirna hallede, diidaama ya totaaji?","Based on the passage:

*   **C: Crevasse hauti be dumu mallimalluje** - The passage mentions ""qanqara on hauto be babal fere seki be mabbi dum be tuuta ji"" which means crevasse hauti be dumu mallimalluje.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Jirgi leddi ha baabal McMordu** - The passage mentions that the south pole traverse starts from mcmurdo, not at babal.
*   **B: Tractors ne naftirta nyebbam** - While the passage mentions that the vehicles use fuel, oil and supplies, it does not specifically state that Tractors are using nyebbam.
*   **D: Vodai wailituggu ha gal hosere** - The passage mentions that lawal man waɗan tarande juɗɗum hedi ɓawo hosere Transantarctic wara ha baabal je leddi toway bo dirtay."
Ko limtaaka ha bindi mai bana ganci maɓɓutuggo gete haadi anda leccituggo Hirna Afirka?,"Based on the provided text (P), the most accurate answer is:

**D: A 4×4 Sauri to waɗan jahagal be mootoo**

Here's why:

*   The text emphasizes the importance of a 4x4 vehicle for traveling in Africa, especially in areas with challenging terrain. It states that a 4x4 vehicle is best because many places can only be accessed by strong vehicles like 4x4s.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   Option A: the passage doesn't mention countries that have no citizen requirements
*   Option B: The passage doesn't mention an open-top vehicle for coastal trips
*   Option C: the passage doesn't mention whether all countries are in Hirna Africa or not"
"No wardi ha bindi, ɗume on husata daw ko sauri voɗai ha ganci maɓɓtuggo gete laarugo ha lenyugo Hirna Afirka be mootoo?","Based on the text, here's the breakdown and the best answer:

*   **P talks about:**
    *   Traveling in Africa by car.
    *   The importance of a 4x4 vehicle for challenging terrain.
    *   Visa requirements, currency exchange, and customs regulations.
*   **Q asks about:**
    *   What are the advantages and disadvantages of touring West Africa by car?

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Tabiti ha vallide mootoo ko yaawi kuje wawan mara haje ha shariyaaji (Definitely by using the car, it is easier to do things legally)** - This aligns with the need to understand and comply with local laws and regulations, as mentioned in paragraph P about customs.
*   **B: Tammi 4× 4 yeccaama, ɓurna baabal wawan nafturgo be va’ade sesa (Because 4×4 has been talked about, it is the best car to use and it is safer)** - This aligns with paragraph P that discusses the usefulness of a 4x4 vehicle
*   **C: Jahagal gal mootoo belɗum ha mi yiɗi wailutuggo iga ɗatal (Car travel is amazing and I want to change the road)** - This is a general statement about the joy of car travel, but it doesn't directly address the nuances of traveling by car in Africa.
*   **D: Na leddi ko toi je heddiri be South Africa mari hujja jahagal ba (Are there countries that borders South Africa and have traveling issues?)** - This focuses on specific border issues with South Africa, which is not the main topic.

Considering the prompt and the information available, the best answer is:

**A and B: Tabiti ha vallide mootoo ko yaawi kuje wawan mara haje ha shariyaaji, Tammi 4× 4 yeccaama, ɓurna baabal wawan nafturgo be va’ade sesa (Definitely by using the car, it is easier to do things legally, Because 4×4 has been talked about, it is the best car to use and it is safer)**

**Important Notes:** The best answer from the multiple choice choices is B, but it is incomplete because A is also good answer."
Je toi nder ɗo limtaaka ha bindi vodai accugo boro ma lincitaaka?,"The correct answer is **C: Ɓe wawan saklugo be goɗɗo fere**

Here's why:

*   **P** explains the dangers of taking drugs across borders.
*   **A** - Stolen items
*   **B** - You become addicted
*   **D** - Authorities may view you as terrorists

C is not specified."
Ko limtaaka ha bindi mai ko nandi hosugo lekki?,"Based on the provided text (P), the correct answer is:

**C: Nastungo lekki ɓoosaaji wawan naftira hirritai** (Entering the world of drugs can lead to exploitation)

**Explanation:**

The text warns about the dangers of getting involved with people who might exploit you for drugs or knowledge, potentially leading to trouble.  Option C accurately reflects this concern. The text emphasizes the risk of exploitation and being drawn into significant problems if you become involved in drug-related activities, especially crossing international borders.
"
Njaram toi on limtaaka daw ko a wawata a waɗa ha sare wakkati jonde?,"Based on the passage, the most suitable answer is **D: Shayi (Tea)**. Here's why:

* **Chamomile Tea (Shayi Chamomile):** The passage explicitly mentions drinking chamomile tea in the evening. This makes tea the most directly supported beverage.
* **Other Options:**

   * **Coffee (Kafe):** Coffee is mentioned but the passage suggests chamomile tea for relaxation during staycation.
   * **Beer (Mbal):** While going to a place with traditional drinks, not necessary this beverage is the best option.
   * **Fruit Juice (Ndiyam ɓukkoi leɗɗe):** the passage tells you what it is.

Therefore, tea is the most fitting and specific answer based on the given text.
"
Je toi a yillata ha jonde to wuro ma andama be ɓe ɗabi’a yarugo?,"Let's break down the scenario and the options to find the best fit:

**Understanding the Scenario (P):**

The person wants a simple beverage to make at home to soothe themselves and relax after their daily routine. They also live in an area with a strong beverage culture and enjoy going out for drinks.

**Evaluating the Options:**

*   **A: Kanti kafe ha yaasi keddu ma (Outside coffee shop is closest)** This speaks to their habit of enjoying beverages away from home and taking solace from it.

*   **B: Ndiyam ɓukkoi leɗɗe ko kanti ɓukkoi leɗɗe namiiga (Herbal tea or fruit herbal tea)** This meets the desire for an alternative tea and something simple to make at home.

*   **C: Hatoi seɓe je yahor woni (A clean empty teacup)** This represents a place they have been known to go to in the past and enjoy.

*   **D: Baabal nyamdu je watta tea mbal (A teacup that has many tea stains.)** This speaks to the person's fondness of beverages because they can't live without a cup.

**Conclusion:**

The best answer is **A: Kanti kafe ha yaasi keddu ma (Outside coffee shop is closest).** It suggests a good answer because the customer prefers to stay at their home during the day.

"
Hatoi dove sculptures man wonii?,"Based on the passage (P), the most accurate answer is:

**C: Ha Island je Eysturoy**

The passage states that Haldarsvik village is ""on the northern tip of Eysturoy island.""  This directly answers the question of where the dove sculptures are located.
"
Deftere leddi je toi on wawan lowa goɗɗo wadda hujja je he’ata chede haɓɓinta kesi?,"Based on the provided context, the correct answer is:

**D: Deftere leddi je ɓukkoi jangirde**

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses going abroad for studies, visa requirements, and the process of applying to universities in foreign countries.
*   The passage mentions obtaining proof of financial support from a sponsor to cover study expenses.
*   ""Deftere leddi je ɓukkoi jangirde"" (Student loan book) refers to a means of financial support, directly related to funding studies and therefore providing financial proof.

The other options are less relevant to the context of securing funding for international studies:

*   **A: Deftere leddi je filu:** (Film country book) Irrelevant to education/finance
*   **B: Deftere leddi je ganci maɓɓutuggo gete:** (Country book of opening eyes) Doesn't directly relate to finance or studying abroad.
*   **C: Deftere leddi je wakkati siɗɗa:** (Country book of short time) Doesn't directly relate to finance or studying abroad."
Mo banta wawan jaɓugo beddaari deftere leddi?,"The correct answer is **C: Jangowo ha leddi yaasi** (Student studying abroad).

The passage discusses the requirements and process for students who want to study in foreign countries.

Ndei on ɓuri hadugo a hakila be chufi?,"The correct answer is **D: To aɗo lanya**

The passage P describes a scenario where you are driving through a forest and your attention is drawn by a small animal that crosses the road. The question Q asks when you are most likely to be distracted while driving. The answer D directly relates to the scenario described: ""when you are driving through the forest"". Options A and C are too general, while B seems irrelevant to the context.
"
"No wardi ha bindi mai, ko hade a acca waɗugo ngam a hisa iga chufi to aɗo laanya sa’e dungu?","The passage P is about a valuable time being wasted waiting for traffic. The question Q asks what should be done to save time from being wasted while waiting in traffic.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Accugo dammuɗe ko va’ete ɗo maɓɓiti je wakkati (Avoiding actions that waste time):** This is a general principle, but doesn't directly address the traffic situation. While true in general, it's not the *best* answer.

*   **B: Laanyugo wakkati golɗum (Choosing a valuable time):** This option suggests picking a better time to travel, likely avoiding peak traffic hours. This directly addresses the problem of being stuck in traffic.

*   **C: Laanyoki nukkuure bulbuldi (Choosing a quiet place):** While a quiet place might be nice, it doesn't help with traffic.

*   **D: Accugo ko va’ata ta fala wakkati jahagal (Avoiding things that waste travel time):** This is similar to option A but more specific to travel. It's a good general idea, but less direct than B.

Option B, ""Choosing a valuable time"", is the best answer because it directly addresses the problem of wasting time in traffic by suggesting avoiding peak hours. It's the most practical solution.

Therefore, the answer is **B**.
"
"No wardi ha bindi, je toi nder volde ɗo daw Sundarbans na gonga ?","Let's analyze the provided text (P) and the options (A, B, C, D) to determine which statement is true based on the text.

*   **A: Ɗo tindina ladde siɗɗa (It is a man-made forest)** The text states that the Sundarbans is a natural World Heritage Site by UNESCO, implying it's not man-made. So, A is false.
*   **B: Reta ɗo maɓɓi be ndiyam (One third of it is water-logged)** The text states ""der gotel der taati do mabbi be babal dyam/loope (one third of it is water/swamp)."" So, B is true.
*   **C: Hanjum on Mangrove je ɓuri maunugo ha duniya (It is the largest mangrove forest in the world)** The text says ""Hunduko maayo Sundarbans buri kohatoi maunugo ha duniyaru (Sundarbans river is the world's largest contiguous mangrove forest),"" so, C is true.
*   **D: Ɗum sare beddi fijirde deer daw Bengal baba ladde (It is the reserve for the Bengal tiger)** The text mentions that the tiger population in the Sundarbans is significant. It also says ""sera ladde man je woni der India be do dyona dum babal suitare leddi je Sundarbans (The Indian part of it is also a tiger reserve called Sundarbans National Park),"" so D is true.

While options B, C, and D are all correct based on the text, the question says to choose only one correct answer. The statement that reflects the core, defining feature of the Sundarbans, as highlighted in the passage, is that it is the largest contiguous mangrove forest in the world.

Therefore, the best answer is:

**C: Hanjum on Mangrove je ɓuri maunugo ha duniya**
"
Geɓe toi je ladde ɗo hakkude leddi India?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **C: Je duniyaaru gal Heritage**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Sundarbans man warti babal asli duniyaru je UNESCO."" This translates to ""Sundarbans has become a UNESCO World Heritage site."" Therefore, the forest is part of the World Heritage.
"
"ndiga ko wani haa nder ko ɓe vindi man, No wardi ha bindi mai, ko nanata jangan?","The correct answer is **A: Himɓe je volwata yaare ɗiɗi fere-fere** (People who speak two different languages).

The passage describes people from different places (Manchester, Boston, Jamaica, Sydney) sitting at a table and speaking their own local languages/dialects. This indicates they are speaking different forms of language.
"
"ndiga ko wani haa nder vindi man, ɗime on mari bone viyugo?","The most fitting answer is **D: Argot je sare**.

Here's why:

*   **Argot je sare** most closely aligns with the text's description of how people from different places using English (Manchester, Boston, Jamaica, Sydney) would speak with their own local variations and slang. ""Argot"" refers to a specialized vocabulary or set of idioms used by a particular group, which is essentially what the text is describing.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **Kalimawol ha sendiri no volwata**: This translates to something like ""Vocabulary speaks for itself."" While true, it doesn't describe the specific language phenomenon discussed.
*   **Adireshiwol**: This seems to relate to addressing someone or something, not the nuances of language within a specific area.
*   **Kalimawol vindiiga**: This translates to ""Vintage vocabulary"". While local languages could be old, ""vintage vocabulary"" does not fully describe the differences between the dialects or argots of different areas."
"No wardi ha bindi mai, Habaru toi ɓurata nafugo mo watta jahagal hosa bus hakkude tashaaji?","Based on the provided text (P), the most helpful information for someone taking a bus between stations is:

*   **B: Waɗowo jahagal mai yahan Bumthang bo hadi acca 7**

Here's why:

*   The text states buses heading east (which includes Bumthang/Jakar) leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM. Therefore, it's crucial for the traveler to **arrive before 7:30** at the station if they are heading towards Bumthang.

Let's analyze other options:

*   **A: Waɗowo jahagal mai yahan Jakar bo arti soodi tikiti**: The text mentions buying tickets early, so this is general advice but not specific to the timing of the trip.
*   **C: Waɗowo jahagal mai yahan Paro bo hadi acca ɓawo 11**: The text provided no information about when buses leave to Paro. The text only mentions the Taxi cost from there.
*   **D: Waɗowo jahagal mai yahan fuuna bo o wari tasha mai hiddai 6:20**: The text states the buses leave cakka 06:30 be 07:30. Coming to the station at 06:20 is ok, but getting to the station before 07:30 is more important to ensure you get on the bus.

Therefore, the most relevant and helpful answer is **B**."
Ko haadata boɗɗum je ganci maɓɓutuggo gete larata ha jahagal funa iga caka tasha bus?,"Based on the provided passage (P), the best advice for someone traveling east from the central bus station is:

*   **B: Soodi tikiti jamanu (Buy tickets in advance)**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states ""...sawara a soda tikiti be lau bako nyalade mai wara (it's advisable to buy tickets in advance because the day may come)"". This indicates that securing tickets ahead of time is a good strategy, as bus trips on peak days will be sold out.
* The passage indicates that busses will usually depart to destinations East between 06:30 and 07:30. The provided option of A: Busji ɗo umma tan ɓawo 8:30 is therefore incorrect.
* The passage explicitly indicates that vehicles are sturdy, especially the Japanese coaster motaji, je do warti do yofi bo (sturdy). Therefor D: Mootoo je sendata ɓuri ha jahagal, is incorrect.
* Option C: Bosji ɗuɗɗum ɗo umma ha nyalade fu timma, is not supported in the passage.

**A: Ɓuri jalugo ha arab en daw luttuɓe leddiiji** (Most different from other cities because of Arab and foreign influence)

The passage explicitly states: ""Wuro man wurti fere be luttudum wuro man gam kanjun latti ɗo mari kuje be haalu arab en ɓuri je Afrika"" which translates to ""The city was different from other cities because it had more Arab culture and language than other African cities.""
"
Je toi on nder ɗo daw Timbuktu na gonga?,"Based on the provided text, the best answer is **A: Ɓe ɗo yaha wuro man be feerowal**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""ngam no yimbe aandi ɗum on watta yimbe wara larugo ɗum, bo ɗon mari baabal siga pireewol"" which means ""because people know it, they come to visit and it has value because of tourism"". This implies that people travel to Timbuktu for special reasons (history, mystique) and that tourism is an important aspect of the city."

"No wardi ha bendi, ha kerol toi buturu lattata tornado?","Based on the provided passage (P), the correct answer is **D: Gada memon leddi** (After touching the ground).

The passage states: ""Fuɗɗi bana ha bututu do busta diga dule, wartugo ‘’heyndu molanagu’’ to be memi leddi."" This translates to ""It starts as a cloud bursting from the sky, becoming a 'tornado' after touching the ground.""
"
Nder maji ngole bongol dou siffawol tornado?,"Based on the text provided, the answer is **C: Bi don ngarta bututuwol gadanta memol leddi**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states: ""Fuɗɗi bana ha bututu do busta diga dule, wartugo ‘’heyndu molanagu’’ to be memi leddi."" which translates to ""Starting as a cloud of dust that breaks away from the ground, becoming a 'dust devil' when it touches the ground.""

The other options are either not directly stated or are less accurate descriptions of the specific process described:

*   **A: Ko ndei bedon gebna hendu yaroro mil 100-200 ha awa** While the text mentions winds reaching 100-200 miles per hour, it doesn't directly link that speed as the defining characteristic of the dust devil's formation.
*   **B: Bedon njaba be kayanku teddudi** (They throw with great force). While a dust devil can move things with force, this isn't the core description of its formation.
*   **D: Dun shabbi darnetedi tubbata hendu ndun dou** (Names given in heaven cover the wind). This does not appear to be relevant to the provided text."
"Iga habar, iga tou jahowo hebata shawariwol ko lati siyasa ha leddi e o fail?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Iga lamu leddi ndi be njata.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that advice on international travel will depend on the traveller's nationality:** ""Bo bana himɓe Amerika je yehi leddi arab en wawan heɓa doka fere be je himɓe Urop en ko arab en heɓata."" This translates to: ""Like Americans traveling to Arab countries may receive different laws than Europeans or Arabs do.""
* **The text mentions getting advice from your government:** ""A wawan a ɗaɓɓita shawara ngomnati ha do anje amma shawara maɓɓe je himɓe lesdi maɓɓe on."" This translates to: ""You can seek advice from your government on the matter, but their advice is for their citizens.""
* **Therefore, the advice a traveler receives on political situations in a foreign country will depend on their country of origin (their government).**

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Iga ji'a di biadi nder shawariji dillobe (From the perspective of business in travel advice):** The passage doesn't focus on business-related advice for travelers.
* **C: Iga bibbe leddi ndibe njata (From the citizens of the country they are going to):** The passage talks about advice *given* to travelers based on *their* citizenship, not on advice received from citizens of the destination country.
* **D: Iga lamu mabbe (From their government):** This is redundant to option A.

"Iga biki sharwoki yahobe, dume na bidde leddi ngoni yadi yigo?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Koitinadun takaitidum ko lati siyasa letti din** (Political conditions of countries should be considered).

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes that when traveling abroad, it's crucial to understand the local laws and customs, which are shaped by the country's political conditions. The passage highlights:

    *   Different laws and treatment of foreigners (like Americans in Arab countries compared to Europeans or Arabs).
    *   Government information is often a general overview and not detailed or up-to-date.

The other options are not as relevant to the main point of the passage:

*   **A: Memibe fadduki inshora (Insurance members have fallen):** While insurance is mentioned, the focus is not on membership decline.
*   **C: Inshora njamu memidum (Health insurance members):** Health insurance is mentioned, but the passage focuses on the political risks and different ways foreigners might be treated.
*   **D: Bayanku ko lati siyasa letti din (Different political conditions of countries):** While technically true, option B *Koitinadun takaitidum ko lati siyasa letti din* is a better answer because it emphasizes the **consideration** of political conditions, which is the main point of the passage."
"Iga hadar, iri yasu ndun woni gida ngol shim dou nangol nga egen yadu?","Based on the information in passage P, the most likely answer is **A: Yadu jugal kautal hore nder gelle mo yadu yahuno aran (Guided city tour in a city you're visiting for the first time)**.

Here's why:

*   **Passage P mentions:**
    *   The globalization of travel since the 19th century.
    *   The availability of travel packages.
    *   The need to research (nature, culture, language) before traveling to a new country.
    *   The benefits of organized travel, like the ease of finding accommodations and transportation.
    *   The convenience of online booking and travel agencies.

*   **Answer A aligns with:**

    *   A guided city tour is organized (addressing the need for information and convenience).
    *   The tour takes place in a new city (addressing the need for cultural understanding).
    *   The tour being the first time visiting the city (aligning with the benefits of starting with organized travel for new places).

The other options are less likely:

*   **B: Yadu asa weje didi dou bajetwol gotol (Two-day trip on a budget):** While the passage mentions costs can be managed, this doesn't address the cultural aspect or initial guidance.
*   **C: Yadu ngaddoru shakantajo ndemgal (Agriculture-focused trip):** The passage mentions culture, but not specifically agriculture.
*   **D: Yadu aran ndu jahowo ha leddi yasi (First trip to a foreign country):** While somewhat related, the guided city tour aligns more closely with the need to learn about the culture of a new place.

**Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer to the question ""Iga hadar, iri yasu ndun woni gida ngol shim dou nangol nga egen yadu? (Based on that, what type of travel is best for someone who is just starting to travel?).**"
"Iga hadar, ngole jahowo hebata iga ballitore egen yadu?","Based on the prompt (P), which describes globalization and its various impacts, the best answer is:

**D: To jahowo yadi fellel je mari aladaji fere di o andi** (If the traveler wants to visit a place with different cultures that he knows).

Here's why:

* **Prompt (P) focuses on the exchange of cultures and experiences:** It talks about the mixing of cultures, languages, and economic influences across borders. It highlights the allure of experiencing new environments and societies.
* **Option D directly addresses cultural exploration:**  It speaks to a traveler's desire to visit a place known for its distinct culture. This aligns perfectly with the core theme of the prompt.

Let's examine why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: To jahowo nangi yago be wartol ngam nda rowa sare:** (If the traveler wants to return to his hometown to get married). While travel is involved, it doesn't connect to the cultural and global exchange discussed in the prompt. It's more personal and localized.
* **B: To jahowo don yidi nangol bukin yadu ontol gite arandejum:** (If the traveler likes to get a first impression trip). Again, this is focused on personal preference rather than the cultural impact of globalization.
* **C: To jahowo don nana ndemgal be leddi iga faki bakeshon:** (If the traveler learns languages while on vacation). While related to culture, it emphasizes language learning as the primary motive, not the broader cultural immersion described in the prompt.

**In summary, option D best encapsulates the connection between travel and cultural awareness that is central to the prompt about globalization.**
"
"Iga hadar, walli nde dne ne hadanta jahowo semte nde ha yago felle kese?","The correct answer is **A: Tammago darde nandude iga e de ngari.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) emphasizes the challenges of adapting to a new environment.** It highlights differences in customs, laws, food, communication, and living conditions. It advises to keep an open mind and embrace the new.
* **The question (Q) asks what prevents someone from embracing a new place.**
* **Option A (Tammago darde nandude iga e de ngari) suggests clinging to old ways of doing things,** which directly contradicts the passage's encouragement to adapt and accept differences. This resistance to change would certainly hinder someone's ability to embrace a new place.
* **The other options are less relevant:**
    * B:  Focusing on familiar food is a normal comfort, not a barrier to embracing a new place.
    * C: Questioning laws is independent of accepting a new culture.
    * D: Hakki lugginki teure dou balandi, is not clear

Therefore, **A** is the most logical answer because it directly addresses the issue of being resistant to change and clinging to familiarity, which are obstacles to embracing a new environment.
"
"Iga ko heba e habar, neddo moye semtata nder yadu ha ledde yasi?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Goddi nyamdu exotic.**

The passage emphasizes how things are different when you travel to another country. It lists various examples, including food. The phrase ""nyamdu, labbi salugo, pellel walugo, yaake, lunnga be kujejji duddum feerotiri pellel jonde ma"" reinforces the idea that food, customs, ways of doing things, and many other aspects are different in another place. The exotic food items that a person will experience when traveling overseas can be linked back to that list.
"
Nder maji shawariwol ngole woni jabaka dou jahowo lesde ummo tode dou yadu araderu?,"The correct answer is **C: Cot ko Hammock don hamma to mobgal wadama**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) talks about the importance of adapting and being flexible in a constantly changing world. It specifically mentions that when traveling, you shouldn't assume you know everything about the place you're visiting, and if you can't find a suitable place to stay, it's good to have a hammock to be comfortable and ready for any situation.

Answer C (Cot ko Hammock don hamma to mobgal wadama) directly relates to this part of the passage, suggesting a hammock as a solution for finding a place to rest.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Hebtu fona bako danani e leddi:** While the passage talks about not assuming you know a country, it doesn't directly advise ""getting a backpack and dancing in the country."" This is too literal and misses the overall message of adaptability.
*   **B: Daccu bonnali nyamdu iga yaduma be yaide arandeje:** The passage focuses on general adaptability and preparation, not specifically avoiding bad food.
*   **D: Luma nder hotel goddum to dun aran yagoma:** The passage contrasts this idea by promoting the idea of adapting when ideal accommodation (like a hotel) isn't readily available. It suggests an alternative.

Therefore, option C best reflects the advice and spirit of the passage."
Dune won limtaka dou goddum dou faddol shede to felle kese ha lesde ummo tode?,"Based on the provided text, the most relevant answer is:

**A: Nyamdu lesde-hirna** (Western food)

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions ""nyamdu be kujeji valla man vowugo"" which translates to ""food and things of that nature."" This suggests a focus on food and related items. The passage goes on to discuss the desirability of integrating Western habits (""habdu wadugo jonde himbe hirna be babal walugo boddum, nyamdu be kujeji valla man vowugo"").
*   While the passage mentions ""bodde"" (good things/beauty), the primary focus related to ""what one should seek in travel"" is more closely tied to exploring food and experiences rather than simply good things.
*   The question asks about ""limtaka dou goddum dou faddol shede to felle kese ha lesde ummo tode?"" which translates to ""What is something to consider when planning a trip to a new place/country?"" Exploring food, especially given the mention of Western food, aligns best with the essence of the passage."
"Radii dime woni burdum ha mo kitaji giduum copi gitedum, amma heba ta lawol ha intanet?","Based on the context of passage P (which discusses backing up important documents and information), the best answer is:

**C: Joiingo kopiwol kotol ha memori komfuta mabbe** (Keeping a separate copy on their computer's memory).

Here's why:

*   **Passage P emphasizes backing up information before traveling.** Option C directly addresses this by suggesting keeping a copy of important documents on the computer's memory (which is like saying internal hard drive).
*   **This aligns with the advice to save documents on a memory stick or disc (online or offline).**

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Hokkol copi ha Mo be njadata:** (Giving copies to whoever they meet) This is risky because you're giving your sensitive information to strangers.
*   **B: Tubbanki koee mabbe kopiwol:** (Hiding/burying copies) This doesn't make much sense in the context of backing up for travel and potential loss of original documents.
*   **D: ""Joiingo kopiwol ha """"dule"""""":** (""Keeping copies in the """"dule"""""") Without knowing what """"dule"""" refers to, it's too ambiguous to be a clear and reliable backup method.

**In Summary:**

The most reliable and relevant option, considering the information in passage P, is **C**. It aligns with creating backups before traveling."
"Iga hadar, dume woni holleki mun yidaka dou kitaji din?","Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **B: Imel inshorajo** (Email address).

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly mentions ""e-mel adres ko numba waya leddi yasi ɓe naftirta to ɓe yiɗi shawara ko to ɓe eman kuje fere"". This translates to ""email address or international phone number they use when they need advice or to send something else"". This shows the purpose of providing an email address is to provide a channel for communication or insurance.

The other options are not well-supported by the text:

*   **A: Numbaji shakantaji lesde ngam shudirgal** (International phone numbers for something) - While international numbers are mentioned, the primary reason seems to be communication, not explicitly for insurance.
*   **C: Numbaji shakantaji lesde ngam tabbitingo** (International phone numbers for verification) - There's nothing mentioned about verification.
*   **D: Imel mo kitaji** (Email of devices) - The email mentioned in the text isn't specifically for the devices, but rather for contacting the traveler.
"
"Iga hadar, ngagirka kane wartanta no fun wait ko murnora naftirego?","The correct answer is **A: 6 × 6 cm negative**

The passage states ""Footoo film na'ura hoto ji fere do naftiran kala 6 be 6 cm..."" which translates to ""Some film cameras use negatives that are 6 by 6 cm...""
"
Fim will ngole latti nandi be DSLR?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Medium-format fim** and **D: 6 × 6 cm fim**.

The passage states that medium-format film, specifically 6 x 6 cm, offers a larger image area compared to 35mm film. This larger area results in more detailed and higher-quality images, which is what the question implies by ""ngole latti nandi be DSLR"" (close to DSLR quality). While option C (56 × 56 mm fim) is related, 6 × 6 cm fim is the standard denomination for the medium-format fim."
"Iga hadar, ngole sakitoto nder di fuddano yadu bindol lubeji?","Based on the context of the initial statement (P) which emphasizes starting a business with a blog website and creating content related to your expertise, the best answer is:

**C: Wadu wepsayit an (Create your own website)**

Here's why:

*   P highlights the importance of having a blog website for your business. Option C is the direct response to that instruction.
*   The rest of the options are a bit indirect and don't directly address the core idea of establishing your online presence through a website.

Therefore, **C** is the most relevant answer in this context.
"
"Fuddano yadu bindol lumo, ngole mari anniya nandudum be boddum aran?","Based on the passage, the answer is **D: Waduki websayit (Building a website)**.

Here's why:

* **P** explicitly states that if you can create and search the internet, you can build a website yourself.
* **Q** asks about the best starting point for a digital business, specifically mentioning blogging and needing a good foundation.

Therefore, the context leads to website building as the most appropriate starting point.
"
Nder wakkatiji dine won wakkati bonnal boyere andadun?,"Based on the passage, the answer is **A: Wakkati fewol**.

The passage states: ""...nyawu fofugo bo ha pellel je mari pewol..."" which translates to ""...respiratory diseases are common in places that are cold..."" Therefore, ""wakkati fewol"" (cold weather) is the correct answer.
"
"Iga hadar, njonde toi wada ta iminiti ha dume?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: Delhi Belly**.

The passage directly mentions ""hallindeji Delhi Belly"" as an example of the type of illness being described.
"
Ngole won nauri ye yaduki nder yenki Schengen?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: Daccol fasfot duddi ngam rakkilango shekfoyen.**

The passage states: ""Harni to a wawan joɗugo ha pellel majum, a wawan nyebbutungo bangeere mai nasete a sali a holli ciftinorgol ma ha be moostinta ba fahin.""  This implies that you need to show identification/documents (likely including your passport) frequently as you move between countries within the Schengen area.

While the passage mentions ""chede be golle kaidi"" (money and time constraints), it's the recurring need to show identification that is the most direct and frequently implied burden when traveling within Schengen.
"
Ko wonte hebatake nder tomb of Tutankhamun?,"Based on the text provided, the most relevant answer is **A: Boiineji koddi.**

The text mentions that the tomb contains ""kujeji boɗɗon bo'o petel"" (beautiful valuable objects). The other options are not directly mentioned in the text.
"
"Iga hadar, yago vancouver war tai shim ko jokkata be shede jahowo? ","Based on the provided text (P), the place near Vancouver mentioned that offers kayaking, rock climbing, paddle boarding, and is accessible by ferry from Granville Island is Bowen Island.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: Bowen Island**
"
"Iga hadar, toye woni nandu dum ko jokkata ta jahowo andal bongal dou vancouver?","Based on the text, the correct answer is **A: Bowen Island**.

The text clearly states that Bowen Island is a popular destination for kayaking and other water activities, accessible by ferry from downtown Vancouver.
"
"Iga hadar, nder jahobe njahata falls to be don tefa yeso babbe wongo?","The correct answer is **A: November ha March** (November to March).

The passage states that during the rainy season (roughly November to March), the water level is high and the falls are at their most impressive. Therefore, those seeking the best views of the falls would visit during this period.
"
"Iga hadar, dume won jodaki ha yago victoria falks shakantaji november be march?","Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **D: Daccol ndungu**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly mentions that during the ""wakkati ɗungu"" (which translates to ""dry season""), the water flow decreases and the falls are not as impressive. While November and March aren't explicitly mentioned, they likely fall within or at the edges of that dry season."
"Iga hadar, nder ko lati ngole woni jabaka be naftirgo saoo shim ha fim?","Based on the passage provided, the best answer is **D: Wakki fimin ha felle nyaram hebta take.**

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) emphasizes safety and being aware of restrictions when filming, especially with drones.**  It mentions things that might be prohibited or require permission.
* **Q asks about potential dangers when filming from the sky.**
* **D (Wakki fimin ha felle nyaram hebta take) translates to ""Filming in sensitive locations can lead to arrest"".**  This directly relates to the dangers of filming in restricted or prohibited areas, which is a key takeaway from the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Ndarol masin kodun wima ngaba fim (Drones can disrupt filming activities)** - While drones *can* disrupt other filming activities, the primary concern of the passage and the question is about the *dangers to the drone operator*, not to others.
* **B: Hebol beddari dou sorgo ko sokki nbal (The drone is easy to lose in flight)** - While losing a drone is a concern, it's not the core safety issue emphasized in the passage.
* **C: Tefol yerda (Finding excuses)** - This is irrelevant to the passage and the question.
"
"No wardi ha bindi mai, Hatoi babe boɗɗi ha filma be miita?","Based on the provided text (P), the correct answer is:

**A: Kumbi ummatoore je wala mo saklata be ko dasi**

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly states: ""Nafturgo jirgi je be lanyata daga dayudum kombi babal be resata jirgi ko babal himbe mofti na kuje handi ba ko be hadai wadugo dum haa woni.""

This translates roughly to: ""Using drones for filming in sensitive areas such as military bases, or areas with many people present is a problematic thing or should be forbidden.""

Option A aligns with this by mentioning that filming in areas with privacy concerns, or those that might expose the subject of the video is a bad thing, so it's a suitable restriction. The other answers have nothing to do with the document's context.
"
Iga ko vindi je toi on nder bayaaniiji no a hiɓata deftere ɓi leddi na gonga?,"Based on the information in the passage (P), the most accurate answer is:

*   **D: Ha babe fere baabal walugo je sare hakkilna be rigista mai** (In some places, community leaders oversee and register marriages)

Here's why:

The passage states:

*   ""...pellel suitare je wuro man ɗo winda inde maɓɓe be hoore maɓɓe (tabutunu a emi).""  This means in certain communities, marriage registration happens locally.

The other options are not directly supported by the passage:

*   **A: To ado juɗa ha babal ɓe wanshata, waɗan wala haje sai to a waɗi rigista** (Before entering a country, there may or may not be a need to register) -The passage refers to registration of marriage within the country, not necessarily for immigration.
*   **B: Leddi fu tefi rigista be ka‘idaji saare** (Countries seek to register based on community customs) -The passage focuses on specific community registration within a country, not necessarily national-level registration.
*   **C: Yelligo baabal kugal je hakkilta be nastu vurtu je leddi wawan nagga** (Explaining the process of monitoring entry and exit from a country can be difficult) - While immigration is mentioned, the core focus is on local registration.

Therefore, option D best reflects the information presented in the provided text."
Je toi nder ɗo na baabal wancowo maɓɓutuggo gete wawa hakkilna be rigista mai?,"Based on the passage, the answer is **C: hedi lelal wuro**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically mentions that in places with such laws, **pellel suitare je wuro man ɗo winda inde maɓɓe be hoore maɓɓe (tabutunu a emi)**, meaning that heads of neighborhoods are to register names on their own.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   The text only mentions how the heads of neighborhoods are supposed to handle the registration of people within the neighborhood.
"
Moi botirta iga mo huwata je caahu ha jahagal?,"Based on the prompt (P), which discusses the benefits of volunteering abroad, the best answer is:

**C: Goɗɗo fere tammi ekkituggo kuje kesum (Someone who hopes to learn new things)**

Here's why:

*   The prompt emphasizes learning about different cultures, meeting new people, understanding oneself, gaining confidence, and developing new skills. These are all aspects of learning and personal growth."
"No wardi ha bindi mai, noi a huwerta caahu ha leddi yaasi nafirta mo watta jahagal dau chede limaɗum?","Based on the passage (P), the correct answer is:

**B: Ɗo latta lawol hiɓugo kugal (It becomes a path to finding employment)**

Here's why:

The passage states that volunteering abroad can ""warta kuje boddon to be beddi cehdehaaje mai gam be do heba kugal vallowo bo be do hokka sudu be ardugol bo be do yoba cede sedda."" This translates to something like:  ""...can become a good thing to develop skills so they can get *voluntary work*, be given accommodation and leadership, and be paid a little money.""

This implies that volunteering can lead to finding *voluntary* (or perhaps paid) work and opportunities to develop skills leading to future employment.
"
"No wardi ha bindi mai, ko hisata asli je caka cala jahagal ha Walt Disney World?","Based on the passage provided, the correct answer is:

**C: Sendurki fu jahagal mai day Walt Disney World**

The passage describes the typical journey of visitors to Walt Disney World: arriving at Orlando International Airport, taking a bus to a Disney hotel, spending a week at the parks, and then returning home. This describes the **entire journey** associated with visiting Walt Disney World.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Vonnigo asawere ha lenyugo tashaaji** While arriving at the airport is part of the journey, it is not the sole original aspect.
*   **B: Jonde ha baabal walugo je yaasi** This is part of the trip, but it only focuses on the hotels within Disney World.
*   **D: Hosugo bus iga tashaaji je ferawal ha yahugo baabal walugo** This is only one part of getting there from the airport."
Volde toi on daw Walt Disney World na gonga?,"Based on the passage, the answer is **C: Ɗon busji ko buti je yarata hoɓɓ iga tashaji je ferawal yahugo ha jawdi maɓɓe**.

The passage mentions that after arriving at Orlando International Airport, visitors take shuttles to Disney hotels. This implies the existence of shuttles that transport people from the airport to their Disney properties.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Tashaaji tammude tikiti hokkitaama ha waɗooɓe jahagal fere**: The passage discusses people selling partially used tickets but doesn't definitively state that discounts are provided. The main point is about restrictions on reselling tickets.

*   **B: Ɗon jippurde ko buti**: The passage mentions arrival at the airport, but doesn't state anything directly about being buti (crowded).

*   **D: Tikiti joori wawam heɓa gwanjoji**: The passage doesn't mention the challenges in obtaining a ticket. It discusses the problem with reselling partially used tickets."
"No wardi ha bindi mai, je toi nder ɗo wawan mawɓi ikkitinooɓe nooneeji ko ha nder vindi ji?","Based on the information in passage P, the most likely answer is **C: taskugo baabal konu (exploring the hostile internet course)**.

Here's why:

*   Passage P mentions a ""hostile internet course"" and that research shows it can provide a company's address. This directly relates to exploring or investigating something on the internet.
*   Other options are less specific:
    *   ""Yeɗuki nder laddi"" (living in the forest) is related to the book/magazine content in passage P, but not the main point of the investigation.
    *   ""Kujeji vallide aran to yamɗai"" (things that help prevent problems), although tangentially related to safety, is too broad.
    *   ""Je o fejata"" (what he's doing) is a general statement and doesn't relate to any specific detail in the passage."
"No wardi ha bindi mai, je toi nder ɗo wawan mawɓi ikkitinooɓe nooneeji?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Baabal konu** (Hostile course).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions ""**hado serra gizo je (hostile) babal (course)**"" meaning ""a hostile online course.""
*   The course is also described as teaching about conflict and warfare, with ""defte ko shafi konu dudai"" indicating that the texts are mainly about conflict."
"No wardi ha bindi mai, je toi on nafata masin ha hisuki iga ndiyam voɗai?","Based on the paragraph P, the best option for water conservation is:

**C: Dolla ndiyam je minti gotel** (Dripping water for one minute)

The passage mentions that in some places water drips for one minute, while in others it takes much longer. The point is to highlight the different rates of water loss, implying that reducing the dripping time to a minimum (like one minute) is beneficial.  The passage advocates for careful water management and using filters effectively.

Let's look at why the other options are less relevant:

*   **A: Dolla ndiyam je mintiiji siɗɗa (Dripping water for six minutes):** This contradicts the idea of minimizing water loss.
*   **B: Sooda ndiyam faadu (Buying water):** While important to have clean drinking water, this is not a water conservation strategy in the context of the passage.
*   **D: Hakkilna ndiyam mai ha hakkilol bungol (Protect the water in a well):** This is important, but the passage doesn't primarily focus on wells. It emphasizes general water dripping and filtration to save water.

Therefore, **C** is the most appropriate answer given the information in the paragraph.
"
"No wardi ha bindi mai, ko tammai lattugo ba mbararugo vulooɓe?","Based on the passage (P), the correct answer is **B: Vuloogo ha ndiyam lugguɗam (Falling into deep water)**.

Here's why:

* **""Serkita do wartiraa yukre-diyam haa koota""**: This means ""The whirlpool returns the water into a deep place.""
* **""no les dyam woni hebbutungo dyam buri ha babal sedda je buri luggugo""**:  This confirms that the whirlpool is feeding into a deeper area.
* **""Wadeji duddum fe’a gam hado chomri yaake do wada yina bo diyam wadi sembe""**: This indicates a struggle to avoid being pulled under by the force of the water.
* **""To a wawi a vurti ha diyam dasata do, nginam a hota hokka te bone""**:  This reinforces the danger; if you can't escape the area where the water falls, you'll be harmed.
Therefore, the passage clearly describes the danger of being pulled into deep water by a whirlpool."
Ko a watta to a ɗaggi ha ndiyam?,"Based on the context of the passage P, which describes the dangers of deep water in a whirlpool-like situation and the need to escape its force, the best answer is:

**A: Habdu a vurta iga diidi mai be nufo gal fere denden a vulita a hota ha asli (Try to get out of it gradually and push yourself to get back to the surface)**

Here's why:

* **The Passage's Emphasis:** The passage warns against the powerful force of the water and the difficulty of escaping it directly. It implies that a controlled, gradual approach is necessary.
* **Why other options are wrong:**
    * **B: Vuulo lau a sala ɓuggol ndiyam mai (Paddle to fight the water):** This is the opposite of what the passage suggests.  Directly fighting the strong current would likely be exhausting and ineffective.
    * **C: Vuulo gal sendederiga (Paddle to get up):** Again, would be ineffective since you would be pushed down.
    * **D: Vuulo ha les leddi (Swim to land):** This doesn't address the immediate danger of the whirlpool.  The focus is on escaping the downward pull.

Therefore, **A** is the most reasonable and safe approach based on the description of the situation. It emphasizes a controlled escape rather than a direct, forceful confrontation with the powerful water.
"
"No wardi ha bindi mai, ha baabal toi yillirki lattan siutaare je mari beddol ilmuji sosai?","The correct answer is **A: Wuro ha kombi Danube** (Wuro ha kombi Danube).

Here's why:

* **The question is asking where sightseeing is significant because of its wealth of knowledge.** The text references the Danube as an example of a river tour. The Danube has historically been a vital waterway for trade, cultural exchange, and military movements across Europe. This rich history makes the areas along the Danube culturally and historically significant. Thus, it's reasonable to infer that it has a ""wealth of knowledge"" related to the area that is valuable for sightseeing.

The other options are less directly implied by the initial text:

* The Erie Canal is related to river navigation, but it's not explicitly associated with ""sightseeing""
* Rhine Valley and Kumbi ndiyam babal kotoi are related to river navigation and water related issues, but it's not explicitly associated with ""sightseeing""
"
"No wardi ha bindi mai, je toi nder ɗo saurata debbo watta jahagal ya nukkuure mai?","Based on the provided text, the best answer is **B: Andal aladaji feretirdi wadai fuddano hakkiloji sembe iga be felle**

Here's why:

*   The text mentions ""watugo halagare do valla"" (using cleverness to overcome), suggesting an emphasis on intellect and strategy.
*   It also refers to understanding the situation and not being naive. This aligns with the concept of ""Andal aladaji feretirdi wadai fuddano hakkiloji sembe iga be felle"" - Understanding existing plans and develop clever intelligent plans from the start.

The other options don't fit as well:

*   A:  ""Acce yeutugo ko nandi kakiiji lumse"" -  Stop the kinds of actions that are suspicious. This is good but this doesn't give instructions.

*   C: ""Daccol wadol yerije delkoje"" - The text doesn't specify about acting like a girl.

*   D:  ""Naftir ngoredam to dum yidama"" - Use strength if it is wanted. This is also good but it doesn't give instructions.

"
"Iga felle biade nder habar, ngole burata nauri dou yadu reube jahobe?","Based on the passage and the question, the correct answer is **D: Iga faki yeso kiyadaka, hautu be nornugo worge gada.**

Here's why:

*   **The passage describes a situation in the Sahel region where the interaction between men and women can be dangerous, especially for women.** It mentions the potential for unwanted attention, violence, and the need to be careful about expressing interest in someone.
*   **The question asks what advice would be most useful for women traveling in that area.**
*   **Option D:** *Iga faki yeso kiyadaka, hautu be nornugo worge gada* - This option speaks about being careful, watching out for what is ahead and consulting/asking men around.

The other options are less relevant:

*   **A: Hettol nadum andadum budakimon** - This refers to a complete and knowing attitude which doesn't necessarily help to protect the women.
*   **B: Wadol fegga manga ngam tabbitingo zamaka kabowo** - This means to be well-known and influential which does not address the dangerous surrounding described in the passage.
*   **C: Hebtu go ferotirgo aladaji wadai hadol darde iga les** - This means to focus on individual beliefs in order to stand out which does not address the safety aspect."
"Iga hadar, ngole woni gida ngol enta hosowo laddeji naftira be lens jodidum?","The correct answer is **C: To dabbawa hosata mai ɗo semta**.

Here's why:

The passage mentions that ""Dabbaji ladde kulniɗe yawanci ɗon yiɗi hunduko darugal foto juɗum"" which translates to ""Shy wild animals usually prefer long lens distances."" This directly implies that using a long lens helps when photographing shy animals because it allows the photographer to stay further away and avoid scaring them.
"
Je toi limtaaka ha bindi mai daw kalubaleji je hoosugo fotoji baoɗɗi ɗi dabbaji ladde?,"Based on the text provided, the best answer is:

* **C: Tefugo tarooɗe mari haje (Finding subjects requires effort)**

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes the challenges of wildlife photography, including the need for time, patience, knowledge, and good equipment.
*   It mentions the difficulty of approaching animals, the regulations in parks, and the challenges of different environments.
*   These points all support the idea that ""tefugo tarooɗe mari haje"" or ""finding subjects requires effort"" is a central challenge in wildlife photography.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as good:

*   **A: Hiɓugo dabbaji hosata hakkilo (Photographing animals requires intelligence):** While intelligence is helpful, the passage focuses more on practical challenges than inherent intelligence.
*   **B: Hakkulgo dabbaji illata (Attention to animals disappears):** This doesn't make sense in the context of the passage. Wildlife photography requires *paying* attention to animals.
*   **D: Wancugo ha ndei baabal mai (Walking on the back of the mother):** This phrase does not appear in the passage and does not have any relevance to the challenges mentioned."
Je toi nde ɗo wawan wanda fitina je lanyuuwo waɗooɓe jahagal nder ladde?,"Based on the provided text (P), the relevant information is that icy and snowy conditions can cause traffic problems in cold, high-latitude regions. The question (Q) asks about ways to mitigate the danger of slippery conditions for vehicles.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Tindiga zirga-zirga:** While it may be beneficial it would not directly address the slippery conditions
*   **B: Foɗoteral siɗɗa:** While it may be beneficial it would not directly address the slippery conditions
*   **C: Salitina uppugo:** Spreading salt (salitina) is a common practice to melt ice and snow, improving traction.
*   **D: Usti laruki:** Reducing speed is a general safety precaution but doesn't directly address the icy/snowy conditions themselves.

Therefore, the best answer is **C: Salitina uppugo**.
"
Dume on latti fotidiran haraji je mastata hakkude lesɗi duniyaaru?,"The correct answer is **A: Kiimu**.

The passage discusses international tax treaties and how they aim to prevent double taxation. ""Kiimu"" in Hausa (given the language of the passage) translates to ""agreement"" or ""treaty,"" which best fits the context of an agreement regarding taxes between countries.
"
"No wardi ha bindi mai, to aɗo huwa ko nandi be mayo manga Amma aɗo juɗa ha get, toi on a yiɗata sigugo ko a naftetta?","Based on the passage, the best answer is:

**C: Ha leddi je a huwata jutta (In the country where they work mainly)**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""To na a diplomat on, huwugo ha leddi yaasi do nufa seto ha yobi haraji babal kugal a leddi a jodata."" This translates to: ""If you are a diplomat working in a foreign country, the understanding is to pay taxes mainly for the work benefits in the country you reside.""

The other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Ha ko toi a juɗata (Where one is born):** While birth place might matter for citizenship and origin, but not tax liability as a diplomat.
*   **B: haa nder United states(Within the United States):** The passage mentions US and Canada as exceptions to general rule, therefore it is not correct to assume it as the rule.
*   **D: Ha chede mai ɗuɗdai (In countries where money is plentiful):** The passage doesn't say anything about tax liability being determined by how rich the country is. It's primarily about the location of their diplomatic work."
haa nder haalaji ko tokki ɗo je toi on tindinai asli gonga duniyaaru?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: Ukkure wawan hosa lebbi jego (Expositions can last up to six months).**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Kujeji do burna fu do yotta nebugo bana lebbi tati be jego on"" which translates to ""The events can last between three and six months.""

The other options are less directly supported by the passage:

*   A: While national achievements are displayed, the passage doesn't specifically state it reveals ""the true nature"" of a country.
*   B: While art is mentioned, the focus is much broader than just art and schools.
*   D: The text indicates that the countries go to show them selves not that they are there to look for other countries.

Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
toi on nder ko saali ɗo je toi nder lawol je gongaaku duniyaaru fu?,"Based on the provided text (P), the most accurate answer is **C: Ukkure sai to ciki lebbi jego (Its duration should not exceed six months)**.

Here's why:

*   The text states ""Kujeji do burna fu do yotta nebugo bana lebbi tati be jego on"" which translates to ""The events usually last between three and six months"".

The other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Je toi nder ɗo ɗum ka’idaaji gongaaku duniyaaru hullugo je duniyaaru fu (It is about confirming international rules for the whole world):** The text describes World Expos showcasing arts, sciences, and cultures, and does not explicitly mention that this is about confirming international rules.
*   **B: Hollitan tarihiiji leddi fu be fitinaje leddi mai (It displays the histories of all countries and their strengths):** While expos showcase what countries are good at, the text doesn't limit the exposition to just histories and strengths.
*   **D: Ngam gongaaku sai to lesɗi fu yahan (For it to be true, all countries have to participate):** The text says that countries *participate* in the expos, showcasing their achievements, but it doesn't suggest that all countries *must* participate for it to be a true expo."
nder ko tokkata ɗo waɗugo ɗume on ustata ngedam dabbaji naggi?,"Based on the provided text, the answer is **D: Haɗuki dabbaaji nuadu be puupe** (Keeping domesticated animals and dogs away).

Here's why:

*   The text emphasizes the importance of maintaining distance from wildlife and avoiding actions that could attract or provoke them. Bringing domesticated animals and especially dogs close to wildlife can certainly cause a disturbance and possibly lead to conflicts or aggression, thus decreasing the population of wild animals.

While the other options may be relevant to safety and wildlife preservation in general, they don't directly reduce the population of wild animals as significantly as introducing domesticated animals that may hunt or harass them."
Toi nder ɗo limtaaka ha bindi mai daw ko wawata dasa naunugo dabbaji ladde?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Do’e hakkilgo daayeega (Lack of knowing distance)**.

The passage states that:

*   Tourists often forget the dangers of wild animals and get close enough to be attacked.
*   People often come to visit without knowing where to stand.
*   Wild animals are large and can hurt people, so people need to be careful and keep their distance.

All these points indicate that **a lack of awareness regarding safe distances** from wild animals is a primary cause of attacks. The other options are either incorrect or not the main point being emphasized:

*   **A: Haccega be sembi (Attacking with strength)**: The passage does not say that wild animals necessarily attack with force.
*   **C: Nyamnugo dabbaaji ladde (Eating wild animals)**: While the passage says that people may try to hunt the wild animals, it primarily emphasizes attacks stemming from tourists getting too close.
*   **D: Ɗabbaaji je vowai be himɓe (Animals who like humans)**: This option doesn't align with the passage's warning about the dangers of wild animals.
"
ha nder dou dume jai nana hani tendina bodeku?,"The question ""ha nder dou dume jai nana hani tendina bodeku?"" translates to ""Which of the following best explains mysticism?""

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: wodi ko wadi ha kugal a huwi ye gogan be barka kuma nda jarudum** - This seems to be discussing something happening in a workplace or with blessings, which isn't related to the definition of mysticism.

*   **B: tokko be dena mysticism toribe holabe lowal monga tabe larina** - This implies that followers of mysticism seek to explain or clarify the connection between themselves and the divine/spiritual realm.

*   **C: himbe tokkada mysticism wawan tokka andalogoga jai wollat be ha rayuwa** - This suggests people following mysticism can adopt different philosophies or integrate it into their lives.

*   **D: ko hani a tora ha kugal ma nandayi be dumdum ha nder dena ngadata** - Talks about seeking something specific in one's work and relating it to belief, not central to the core definition of mysticism.

Given the description in the passage P, mysticism is focused on seeking connection with a higher power or spiritual truth. Option B (followers of mysticism seek to explain or clarify the connection between themselves and the divine/spiritual realm) most closely aligns with this goal, so it is the most relevant answer.
Option C can be a result of practising mysticism, but it doesn't exactly explain what mysticism is.
**Therefore, the best answer is B.**"
ha ndr kisa do dume ha ko tokkindiri ala ko yali dumbe mysticism?,"Based on the provided passage, the best answer is:

**D: turugo ko badutunogo jomiraro** (seeking communion with, origin, or fundamental reality or being, a uniting with the absolute, or god.)

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that mysticism is about seeking communion with (badutunogo) a higher power or reality (jomiraro). The other options don't directly align with the definition given.
"
nder kisa moi fuduno ndemri duniya?,"The correct answer is **C: maori daga himbe polynesia**.

The text states: ""tabbutungo andal je himɓe Maori eggi daga Polynesia der firawol ndiyam ɓe jafti New Zealand..."" which translates to ""It is understood that the Maori people migrated from Polynesia in canoes and reached New Zealand..."". This clearly indicates that the Maori originated from Polynesian people.
"
nder kisa do himbe fere deugal goddo ha ndemri fitdi?,"The passage states: ""Koganma, sabon Dalila ɗum tabbiti je Moriori ha je komba je berniwol Maori mo hotti daga niwzealand yahugo Cakkare lesdi nder ndiyam Chatham, ɗon umma be hoore maɓɓe feerejo, jonde jam gikku.""

This translates to: ""However, new evidence proves that the Moriori were a branch of the Maori who left New Zealand and went to the remote Chatham Islands, where they developed their own unique, peaceful culture.""

Therefore, the answer is **C: Nder Chatham islands**.
"
Ha nder kisate a naftirda pure land je origame je wollata folder?,"Based on the provided information, the best answer is:

*   **B: Folder mai mari beedari ha kugal mota** (The folder has to do with motor work)

Here's why:

*   The text states that John Smith created Pureland origami to help those with motor skill challenges. This implies the origami method is somehow related to or beneficial for motor skills.
*   The other options don't align as directly with the purpose described in the text:
    *   A: While it might be easier, the main purpose is linked to motor skills, not simplicity.
    *   C: The text suggests a more practical reason than pure aesthetics.
    *   D: It needs one sheet of paper as mentioned in the passage.
"
nder ko tokkindiri do dome on nandeye be ledi mara dotti orgami?,"Based on the description of Pureland origami, the correct answer is **B: yanayi nandaye be sada folds mai.**

Here's why:

*   Pureland origami emphasizes using only simple folds.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   A: This refers to understanding folders, which is not specific to Pureland Origami.
*   C: This talks about folds that are filtered, which doesn't align with the simple folds emphasized in Pureland Origami.
*   D: This refers to folders who have professional knowledge, which isn't specific to Pureland Origami."
nder kisa do hedi toi on nandeye be indus lowol perdam?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: perdam pakistan hande**.

The passage states that the Indus Valley Civilization included ""ko nangi leddi Pakistan,"" which translates to ""what encompasses the land of Pakistan."" This indicates that modern-day Pakistan is part of the area where the Indus Valley Civilization existed.
"
ha nder ko tokkindiri dome onnana ende bronze dubi pendam jai be valli ha nder kisa mai?,"Based on the text provided, the most appropriate answer is:

*   **B: Perdam Indus sarasivati**

The text mentions that some scholars prefer the term ""Indus-Saravati Civilization"" because the civilization flourished along the Saravati River as well as the Indus."
Ha nder kisa do dum on tokkindiri wadi jud wakaati mardum amfani?,"Based on the passage (P), the best answer is **A: Houtugo hore be himbe (Working together with people/Unity with people)**.

Here's why:

*   **P emphasizes unity:** The first sentence directly states the benefit of unity and cooperation.
*   **P condemns division:** The second sentence warns against division and self-interest.
*   **The overall message:** The speaker encourages people to understand the importance of working together for a common goal.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **B: Burdi ndirgo yedde hore (Better than turning away from yourself/Better than self-denial):** This isn't directly supported. The passage isn't about personal denial or avoidance.
*   **C: beda famtunogo dome natata pete ha dou manga (It's better to understand the things that enter a big thing):** While understanding is important, the passage's primary focus is collaboration.
*   **D: Hebtugo dume on valla'ata en (Find out what helps us):** While understanding our sources is important, the passage's primary focus is collaboration.

Therefore, the best interpretation and correct answer is **A**.
"
Ha nder kisa do ja ko tokkindiri dome on be murnata hakilango gotta jai vallata?,"The correct answer is **C: Kautal hoore**.

Here's why:

* **Understanding the Passage:** The passage is discussing the benefits of unity and cooperation versus division and self-interest.
* **Key Phrases:**
    * ""To en hauti hoore en pat en heɓɓan hayru majum"" (If we unite, we will all get the good of it)
    * ""To on wi'i on ɗawan to himɓe senda on tan larata nafu mai kamɓe ma je wakkati seɗɗa"" (If you are divided, people will only look after their own interests for a short time)
* **Connecting to the Question:** The question asks about something that helps with long-term well-being and happiness. Unity and cooperation are the most effective means of attaining that.
* **Analyzing the Options:**
    * **Kautal hoore** (Unity/cooperation) best aligns with the message of the passage and the long-term benefits being discussed.

Therefore, **C** is the most logically sound answer.
"
"Daga bindoul, moije bili firingo boidum yembre majjinre konu?","The correct answer is likely **D: Himbe Filipino (The Filipino people)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) is about the exploitation of the Filipino people by American imperialism.** It describes how they were forced to pay taxes and debts, and how the profits were taken by American interests. The core issue is the oppression and economic burden placed on the Filipino people.

While the other options might be tangentially related to the context, they don't directly answer the question ""Who are the primary sufferers/victims?"" The passage centers on the plight of the Filipino people.

The question (Q) talks about a ""burning thing"" (likely metaphorical) of anger and war being extinguished. This suggests that the Filipino people's resistance or struggle against the American occupation diminished. Therefore, the Filipino people would be the logical option
"
wakaati nde war ha dubi templars?,"Based on the passage:

*   The passage states that information about the Templars reached Europe during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **D: Nder karnu 13** (In the 13th century)"
zamanu toi o waribaru dubi templars en?,"Based on the provided text (P), the Knights Templar were active during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).

Therefore, the best answer is **B: Nder Karun 12** (In the 12th Century).
"
lokki toi likitaben Roman ko ennoftirnai wakkaati lom lombe mobbe sali?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Nƴaudugo daga traumatic stress jai nanata ha peleji sadatives**.

The text explicitly mentions that Roman doctors used morphine and scopolamine, both of which are sedatives, to alleviate pain. The text also states that Roman medical practices had a wide reach over centuries. This supports the idea that they would have likely used sedatives for traumatic stress during battles.
"
Nder kisa do hako tokkindirido dume nana attribute jai yehugo wada jangirde asibiti ha wakkati roman empire?,"The correct answer is **A: Shirugo doctore en be rewati ledi**

Here's why:

The passage clearly states that Augustus, the Roman Emperor, started recruiting doctors and training them. This is the most direct attribute mentioned in the text about the development of medical knowledge and practices within the Roman Empire.
"
ko a mari amma abon ha less goddo?,"Based on the initial paragraph (P), which discusses the diversity of eyes and their different capabilities related to light and sensory processing, the best answer is:

**C: ko ananata ha wavelenght (which translates to ""it detects wavelengths"")**

Here's why:

* **P discusses how different eyes are sensitive to different types of light and have varied abilities.** This directly relates to the concept of detecting different wavelengths of light.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: ko yietebe naneta ha tagadi (which translates to ""it is called naneta ha tagadi"")**: This doesn't make sense in the context of explaining how eyes function.
* **B: Haje tagadi (which translates to ""Need tagadi"")**: This is not relevant to the topic of eyes and sensory perception.
* **D: seditugo mayi ship (which translates to ""modify my ship"")**: This is completely unrelated to the passage.
"
Ha dou dume on tahei gete variation do nufata?,"Based on the passage, the answer is **A: Nanugo wavelenght**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions ""Wodi ire-ire gite fere-fere, wodi irin sembe mai jongitini be no halitta mai yidi."" This translates to ""There are different types of eyes, with different powers related to what they like in nature/the environment."" This implies that different eyes are sensitive to different aspects of the environment.

*   The passage goes on to mention ""Lambaji ferefere heba huwa boddum,"" which means ""Different wavelengths can be used well.""

Therefore, the passage suggests that variation in eyes allows organisms to sense different wavelengths of light.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Ko hani woni nder dalɗi (What is inside the cells):** While the internal structure of cells is important for vision, the passage doesn't primarily focus on it when discussing eye variation.

*   **C: Level of acuity:** Acuity (sharpness of vision) is related to eye function but is not the central theme of the variations being described.

*   **D: The complexity tatdi (The complexity of the test):** This doesn't fit the context of the passage about the variety of eyes in nature."
Ha nder kisa mai dume on ko valleye ha nder ye nandeye be dena?,"Based on the text, the best answer is **C: gurus on tokkimo wadi dena guru nanak**.

Here's why:

*   The text states ""Wodi guruji je'nai be jabi bawo mako,"" which translates to ""There were nine gurus who came after him [Guru Nanak]."" This supports the idea of a succession of gurus following Guru Nanak.

Let's look at why the other options are not as accurate:

*   **A: Sikhism vangion sanidi sendurugobe hi'be sectarian ha hindu dabiya:** This statement is partially true, but the text emphasizes the Sikh perspective of seeing their religion as distinct, not simply a sect of Hinduism.
*   **B: guru hofon ha amiyi nder himbe sikhism:** The text does mention the importance of the Guru in Sikhism, but this option does not answer the specific question about a value of religion.
*   **D: Ɗdbiya sikhism fudi daga hinduism en:** While Sikhism originated in a Hindu context, the text also emphasizes the distinction that Sikhs see between their faith and Hinduism.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer.
"
ha nder kisa ndo dume ha nder ko takkindiri do nandi be andal sikh?,"The correct answer is **A: Niniyi guru** (Following the Guru's teachings).

Here's why:

* **The passage clearly states that Sikhs follow their deena as Gurmat, which translates to ""the path of the Guru"".** This directly links the core practice of Sikhism to the teachings and guidance of the Gurus.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Ɗabiya lenyol indiya (Indian cultural traditions):** While Sikhism originated in India, the passage emphasizes its distinct identity and origin from Hinduism. Therefore, while some cultural influences might be present, it's not the defining characteristic of Sikhism.
* **C: Saluso be yerdago be dina indiya (Rejection and acceptance of Indian religion):** The passage acknowledges Sikhism branched out of Hindu religion.
* **D: Volwugo be yare punjabi (Speaking and understanding Punjabi):** Punjabi is important because the Sikh scriptures are written in it and it's the language of the Punjab region where Sikhism originated. However, knowing Punjabi is not the central tenet or defining characteristic of practicing Sikhism. The core is following the Gurmat, the Guru's path."
Ha nder ksa do dome on bekkoi jai wala jamu sosai habdata hakilana ha rayuwa mabe?,"Based on the provided text, the passage suggests that children with ADD have difficulty focusing and understanding, and they engage in activities like playing games or watching TV (larugo figirde) as a way to cope or stimulate their minds.  Therefore, the most likely answer from the given options is:

**C: larugo goi-goi ha tv**
"
Ha nder kida dobo do upa dome wadi bekkoi jai wala hakilo dingata watugo hore mabe ha damuwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Usturo hyperactivity**.

The passage describes ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) and its symptoms in children, which include difficulty concentrating, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. The question asks about a characteristic behavior of children with ADD in certain situations, and hyperactivity is a key symptom.
"
Ha nder kisado dome nandoye scaffolding?,"Based on the passage (P) and the question (Q), the correct answer is **A: fuddoge muroja'a bako fuddogo njelle comfuta**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions ""mallumjo fere on je scaffold amma kanjum perpeton kuje jogugo paper goddo ha Microsoft office,"" which suggests the traditional scaffolding method involves physical materials and assistance.
*   The passage then contrasts this with ""Kujeji watugo ha mahol ɓe mahata ha nder kuje hollata ha komputa man ɗo holla kujeji handi goɗɗo hakkila be ɗum, ɗo walli himɓe ekkititta ɗum fama sosai."" This indicates that the digital version (dome nando) of scaffolding involves things like computer programs.

Therefore, fuddoge muroja'a bako fuddogo njelle comfuta (""review software or a computer program"") best encapsulates the meaning of ""scaffolding"" in this context."
Dome ha nder ko tokkinidiri nana duko wala nder scaffolding?,"Based on the passage, the best answer is **D: scaffods de bella ekitugo kusa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage talks about ""mallumjo fere on je scaffold"" - a teacher using scaffolding. This directly supports the idea that scaffolding helps with learning.
*   The passage discusses computer programs showing how things work, which helps people learn - this is another form of scaffolding.
*   None of the other options are directly discussed or supported by the passage."
"Iga habar, nder kiso MySpace feature bellt bekkoi jarboe ha jangirde?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: ko shafi himbe miliyon 54**.

The passage states directly that ""MaiSpes on je tatabre ha websaits himɓe ɓuri marugo pej bo jotta himɓe miliyan 54 ɗo mari pej ha ɗoɗɗo"" which translates to ""MySpace is one of the websites where people have more pages and now 54 million people have pages there."" Therefore, the information about 54 million people is a feature related to MySpace mentioned in the passage.
"
"Iga habar, ngole woni nandeye Krushchev's kude shiya jabgal?","The correct answer is **D: Jabbi yidde ikonomi ko yidi**.

Here's why:

The passage mentions that Khrushchev agreed to ""kujeji fere je himbe yidi"" (other things that people wanted) and that he allowed Wladyslaw Gomulka, a popular figure, to become the leader. This implies a willingness to compromise and concede to some economic and political demands of the people in Poland.
"
Nder kolati dou dume wani la ko lattini shiya jabal leddi Poland?,"Based on the text, the correct answer is **A: Komunism**.

The passage describes a situation where workers are demanding more money under a communist system led by Khrushchev. This implies that dissatisfaction with the communist system and its economic policies is a key factor driving the events in Poland. The mention of Khrushchev and the subsequent changes also points to the influence of communism.
"
"Oga habar, dume woni memai hakkunde USSR be USA?","Based on the passage provided, the answer is **A: Al'ada ferjuntirdum**.

The passage states that the conflict arose due to a clash of systems and different ways of life (""je karshe je konu be hautidiri je system, no be watta be al’ada yari timmitina je leddije do’ata""). This implies a fundamental difference in ideology and cultural values, making ""Al'ada ferjuntirdum"" (Cultural differences) the most appropriate answer.
"
Nder ko lattidi ngoye woni na hollita dalila tubbaki ngang ko yiɗa ha ɓandu?,"Based on the provided context, which describes the importance of bodily functions, the most relevant answer is:

*   **C: Ndaranki njode ndiƴam (Standing requires water)**

**Explanation:**

The passage focuses on how bodily functions work to maintain balance and health. While the other options could be relevant in certain contexts, maintaining hydration is a fundamental aspect of bodily function and homeostasis. Water is crucial for numerous processes, including regulating body temperature, transporting nutrients, and removing waste. Therefore, option C directly relates to the passage's emphasis on the importance of how the body works to stay healthy."
ko bobete nder giza Platuau?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: Pyramid mouɗum**.

The text states that the Giza Plateau contains numerous pyramids, with the largest being the Great Pyramid.
"
Kowadi dun wadi pyramid mouɗum?,"The correct answer is **B: Mainingo Pharaoh** (Honoring the Pharaoh).

The passage states the pyramids were built to honor the pharaohs and to provide them with a place to rest and be remembered for eternity.
"
Moye mari hakki andal wulki fellel du'a?,"The correct answer is **B: Alexander mouɗo**.

The passage states that Alexander, as a king, offered to rebuild the temple but was refused. This indicates that he had the means and willingness to do so, making him the one who ""mari hakki andal wulki fellel du'a"" (had the potential to rebuild the temple).
"
Nde maji ngole woni ngonga dou makitaki fellel du'a Artemis?,"The correct answer is **B: dun mahitaki wakkati Alexander mouɗo**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the temple was rebuilt after Alexander the Great died in 323 BCE. So, the rebuilding happened **during** Alexander the Great's lifetime.
*   Option A is incorrect because the passage states that Alexander offered to rebuild the temple but was refused. The rebuilding happened **after** his death
*   Option C is not necessarily right. The passage mentions that the temple was rebuilt, but doesn't state that Herostratus was involved.
*   Option D is incorrect because the passage mentions that the temple was rebuilt in 323 BCE, not 320 BCE.

"
"Iga habar, nde woni wakkati taggle njahta dou koile ɗiɗi?","The correct answer is **A: Dubi million jeɗiɗi shalidum** because the passage states ""Sahelantropus ha dow kosɗe ɗiɗi dilli tun duuɓi miliyon 7 Sali."" (Sahelantropus walked on two legs from 7 million years ago).
"
Tagle ɗene bowi yohirgo koile ɗiɗi?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is:

**A: saheylanturopu**

The text states that ""pat be wawan Sahelantropus ha dow kosɗe ɗiɗi dilli tun duuɓi miliyon 7 Sali"" which translates to ""even Sahelanthropus could walk on two feet as far back as 7 million years ago."" Therefore, Sahelanthropus is the earliest hominin mentioned capable of bipedalism.
"
Dume askar tn ndiƴam leddi Germany yiɗi wakki wakkati WWII?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **B: Hadugo Britain jabgo jama'are be kayaji**.

The text states that German U-boats tried to ""darnugo moftorde do"" which translates to ""block supplies there"". The paragraph also speaks about how the Allies felt Germany would conquer Britain like the rest of Europe if they were successful. Therefore, the goal was to prevent Britain from receiving people and supplies to weaken them, aiming for their conquest.
"
Dou habar dokkadum moye mari nasaru be askar ndiyam konu wakkati konu wala Atlantic kamfe?,"The correct answer is **A: British be Americans**.

The passage states that the Americans fought to protect their people and resources and that the Allies were fighting against Germany. Since Britain was part of the Allies, they were also fighting against Germany.
"
Dume won lattaki wakkati Assyrians ngaɗi nauri be kadobe pucci?,"Based on the provided text, the Assyrians brought the ""Ummatore fudarde,"" which translates to ""Horse chariot"" or ""Chariot beginning."" Therefore, the closest answer is:

*   **C: Maggan pucu** (This likely means ""horse chariot"" or similar in the language of the text)

The text explains how they used chariots effectively in warfare."
Noye kabɗobe puci ngadata?,"The answer is **C: Dou jodargal puci**

The passage states ""...wadi ko himbe jodata do man puccu dasa je Assyrian usta teddugo, bedda yawugo bo buri taskugo doggina soja en be iri majum fere."" This translates to ""...making it possible for people to ride horses, so the Assyrians started to respect it, improving its speed and making it more efficient in chasing soldiers and other things."" This indicates that the riders rode on the horse itself.
"
"Iga habar, to woni dun hobata be leddi Babylon?","The correct answer is **D: Wadduki sadaka nder gese dabbaji**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes the people of Babylon building temples (gunkiji) and bringing sacrifices (ko ɓe hirsinta) to their gods. It also mentions the importance of these temples for religious ceremonies. Offering sacrifices, especially from agricultural products, aligns with the described practices. The term ""sadaka nder gese dabbaji"" translates to ""sacrifices from agricultural fields,"" which is consistent with the religious rituals in ancient Babylon."
Nden majum dume woni dum modibbo on?,"The correct answer is **D: Ziggrata**.

The passage describes a type of structure called ""ziggurats,"" which were pyramid-like temples built in ancient Mesopotamia.  The description aligns with what is known about ziggurats and their function as sacred spaces. The other options don't fit the context of the passage.
"
Ndeye lamdo Tutankhamun hebi wonnaki?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: Gadanta hebtol yenande mako**.

The text states that Tutankhamun's tomb was discovered in 1922, leading to his widespread recognition. This makes ""Gadanta hebtol yenande mako"" (the discovery of his tomb) the reason why people know him so well today.
"
Dume wade lamdo Tutankhamun ada masin nder lamiɓe Egyot en?,"The correct answer is **C: Nguika ujuneje atifact iga yenonde mako (The thousands of artifacts from his tomb)**

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""Kujeji ɗuɗɗum ɓe iri be Tutankamun ɗo resi ba yake ɓe wati ɗum, ha nder man wodi kujeji be ka’e zamanu naneno je mari hafu sosai yottatn adadu ujunerre"" which translates to ""Many things were found with Tutankhamun in his tomb that have lasted up until now, including many valuable ancient artifacts amounting to thousands.""

The passage emphasizes the wealth of artifacts found in his tomb as the reason for his fame. The other options are not the main reason for his fame according to the provided text.
"
Dume on gecci towotae homel kasi wadugo?,"The passage states: ""bumdo je vindata, mo vindi kujeji didi je wala ba majum ha biindi Greek: biindi Lliad be Odyssey."" This translates to ""a blind man, who wrote two things that didn't exist in Greek culture: the Iliad and the Odyssey"".  Therefore, Homer was blind.

The question asks: ""What disability did Homer have?""

Since he was blind, the correct answer is:

**A: Nanugo (Hearing)**

I made an error in the initial assessment.  The passage says he was ""blind"" (""bumdo"").  ""Nanugo"" means ""Hearing"". ""Yiugo"" means Seeing.

The *correct* answer is actually none of them. There is no option related to blindness, so the question does not have a correct answer. However, since the passage directly mentions him being blind, any translation problems aside, it should be:

* **E: bumdo (Blind)**

Since that isn't an option, the question is flawed.
"
Girken koji lonludi toi on adira goddim kuburi luga?,"Based on the passage, here's the breakdown:

*   The passage states ""Harjotta Fijerde Sodokuls be Aristofans on himɓe ɓuri andugo... "" which translates to, ""Playwrights Sophocles and Aristophanes are well known...""
*   Pythagoras is mentioned as a famous mathematician.

Therefore, both Sophocles and Aristophanes are playwrights from Greece. The question asks, ""Which Greek individual is known for writing plays?"" From the available options, both Sophocles and Aristophanes are valid answers, but since only one option is allowed, we have to make a choice. Based on the sentence construction, Sophocles is mentioned first; therefore, that makes it more likely.

**Correct Answer:** A: Sofokuls"
Hankurre ndeyere on lenyel hibrant en buri vonnugo wakkati mabe?,"Based on the provided text (P), the answer is **D: Ha sare**.

The passage describes how Jewish people lived, what they did, and mentions the lack of forests. This suggests they lived **in villages or towns (Ha sare)**, engaging in activities like cooking, trading, and building. The context doesn't strongly support the other options, which refer to specific events or concepts not directly mentioned.
"
Hunde ndyere en nde wala bote ha hebrew?,"The correct answer is **C: Sare mabbe**.

Here's why:

* **P describes the difficult circumstances the Jews face.** It talks about a lack of food, having to find ways to prepare food, finding space to trade, building shelter, and scarcity of wood. These are all challenges related to their *environment* and resources, in other words, *sare mabbe* which means their environment/circumstances.

Let's eliminate the others:

* **A: Climate mabbe** (Their climate): While climate might be a factor contributing to the difficulties described in P, it's not the *sole* or most direct cause. P mentions more than just weather conditions.
* **B: Habaruji mabbe** (Their news/stories): This is irrelevant to the challenges outlined in P.
* **D: Defande mabbe** (Their defense): While the Jews probably needed to defend themselves, P doesn't focus on warfare or security. It focuses on survival and resourcefulness.

Therefore, **C: Sare mabbe** is the most encompassing and accurate answer. It captures the overall theme of environmental and resource-related hardship described in the passage.
"
Ha nder limitadido hunde ndeyere on woni fereteral hakkude scandinavian?,"The correct answer is **A: Habaruji mabbe** (Their history).

Here's why:

*   The passage contrasts Greenland with Scandinavian countries (Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Iceland). It mentions that despite Greenland being discovered by a Norse (Scandinavian) figure, there are many differences in people, language, customs, and history between Greenland and the Scandinavian countries. The question asks what limited thing they share, making the History their only connection (habaruji mabbe)."
Moi arti jadugo ha nokkure getend greenland?,"The correct answer is **A: lenyol geteden eskimo**

The passage states that ""himɓe Eskimo ɗonno joɗa ha totton yake man,"" meaning Eskimo people were already living in Greenland when Erik the Red arrived.
"
Yebre ndeyere on yidata busotugo?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: Mardo robe Romanko'en** (Wealthy Romans).

Here's why:

*   The passage describes how wealthy Romans (marɓe cede man) liked to add extra ingredients to their food and enjoyed eating at leisure. This indicates a higher standard of living and a more luxurious culinary experience compared to the poor.
*   The passage contrasts the wealthy Romans with the poor (talaka en be debbo man), who ate more basic food.

Therefore, the passage is most interested in the eating habits and food culture of the wealthy Romans."
Girkan koju lanluo toi on wala ha nder nƴamdi romanko'en nane?,"The correct answer is **D: Taso manga je kuse tolotolo (Only hard fruits)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""...ɓe wala butali, wala tomatu, wala dankali, wala koko, bo wala kiɗɗo Roma je metti talo talo."" This means they didn't have tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, or ""kiɗɗo Roma"" (a type of pepper) which are considered *manga je kuse tolotolo*. Therefore, *manga je kuse tolotolo* was missing from their diet.
*   The other options are wrong because:
    *   A: The passage says the poor ate their food seated, not at home.
    *   B: They did eat dodon kod.
    *   C: Rich men did not have time for the party

"
Dume gen on towo girkan koyiɗi mari jutal nafu?,"Based on the provided text (P), the correct answer is **C: A City state**.

The text mentions:

*   ""civitaz, ɗo nufa wuro ko wuro-lesdi"" which translates to ""civitaz, which means city or city-state"".
*   ""yake feere ɗon tabbitina maunugo pellel"" which indicates the development or affirmation of a large settlement.

These points directly relate to the concept of a city-state.
"
Hender boulwadum ko fe'a taha leddi?,"Based on the provided text, the closest and most relevant answer is:

**C: A City state**

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses the concept of ""civilis"" deriving from ""civis"" (people of a city) and ""civitas"" (city or city-state), which directly links to the concept of a city-state as a defined political and cultural entity. The phrase ""wuro ko wuro-lesdi"" (city or city-state) in the passage clearly points towards this.

The other options are less directly related to the core meaning of the text:

*   **A: Perol aladaji (Pearl of cultures):** While culture is mentioned, the focus isn't on a general ""pearl of cultures"" concept but specifically on a type of cultural and political organization.
*   **B: Al'ada gontel (A single culture):** The passage speaks of cultures that can disappear, suggesting the possibility of multiple cultures rather than a single one.
*   **D: Al'ada pamorol (Small culture):** While the text does mention cultures losing their impact, the key concept isn't just small cultures, but the emergence and significance of a city-state.

**In summary, the connection between ""civitas"" and ""city-state"" makes option C the most appropriate answer based on the provided text.**"
Habatuji toi en dum Drukgyal Dzong je nana gonga?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: Sum assisi do ha Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel**.

The passage states that Drukgyal Dzong was built in 1649 by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel to commemorate his victory over the Tibetan-Mongol forces.  This directly links the fortress to Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.
"
Bolwadum toi Vodi vangini Irritati vite ha Drukgyal Dzong?,"Based on the provided text (which seems to be in a mix of languages with some potential errors), the most likely correct answer is **B: Hibe tabetan mamgo sembe nasara**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Drukgyal Dzong was built in 1649 by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel to commemorate his victory over the Tibetan-Mongol forces. So option B best represents this.
*   The other options are not as closely related to the reason for the construction of Drukgyal Dzong.

Therefore, **B** is the most logical and accurate answer based on the given text."
Girkan kojon lonludo boi wadum da habam Cambodia dum gonga?,"Based on the provided text:

*   **D: Thais vonnu phnom phen** is the most accurate answer. The text explicitly states ""Himɓe Tais en nasti leddi Kambodiya de ɗuɗɗum ha zamanu duuɓi 1800 en bo be yake duuɓi 1772 de ɓe wonni Fonfen."" (The Thais entered Cambodia a lot in the 18th century and in 1772 they conquered Phnom Penh).

Let's analyze why the others are incorrect:

*   **A: Vietnam vonni phnom fluen:** The text says the Vietnamese influenced Cambodia, but doesn't explicitly state they conquered Phnom Penh.
*   **B: Cambodia hauti Thailand ha 1772:** The text indicates that Thais conquered Phnom Penh in 1772, not that Cambodia conquered Thailand.
*   **C: Cambodia hauti diga Vietnam ha arande 18th jamanu sali:** The text says that Vietnamese started influencing Cambodia towards the end of the 18th century, not the beginning.

Therefore, **D** is the best answer."
Girkan gojon lonludo toi en biddum virtinta invasions dum cambodia?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: Thais be vietnam hautì ha cambodia ha 1772**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states that the Thais invaded Cambodia and captured Phnom Penh in 1772. It also mentions that the Vietnamese later became involved.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vietnam hauti ha cambodia limtal** - While the text says the Vietnamese became involved, it doesn't confirm they occupied the whole country.
*   **C: Vietnam vonni phnom fluen** - The text says the Thais (not the Vietnamese) captured Phnom Penh (likely what ""Phnom Fluen"" is referring to).
*   **D: Girkan kojon lonludo toi en wad Dutch hirna India wodai ha kamfani mobbe** - This option is entirely unrelated to the information presented in the text about Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam."
Toi der tokkidi latti Dutch funna leddi India kampani wadai sa'e wakkati mabbe ha Taiwan?,"The correct answer is **A: Maji bural fombina hirna naku island (They built a base in the southwest of the island)**

The passage states ""Ha 1624, kampani Dutch fuuna India mabbiti babal ha hedi hirna fombina Taiwan..."" which translates to ""In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan...""

Therefore, option A is the most accurate description of what the Dutch East India Company did during their time in Taiwan.
"

The passage states: ""Ha 1895, ɓawo sende nasaraku ha kondu arande je Sino-Japanese (1894-1895), ngomnati Qing wati juno ha ɗerewol jonde jam je Shimonoseki, je be hokki Japan laamu Taiwan, je laami leddi man ha 1945.""

This translates to: ""In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which *gave Japan control of Taiwan*, which they ruled until 1945.""

Therefore, the Treaty of Shimonoseki established Japan's power (control) over Taiwan.
"
Noi be faddinta PH ha chemical?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **C: Dudirika hydrogen ions ha chemical**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states that the pH value indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (H) present in the chemical.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A:** While pH does relate to acidity, the primary thing it *measures* is hydrogen ion concentration.
*   **B:** The text talks about hydrogen ions, not just protons in general.
*   **D:** The text mainly focuses on protons, the relationship between them, and the measurement of pH."
Ko be itti ha hydrogen ions?,"The correct answer is **D: Elekturons**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kujeji wani nder haidrojin proton en on je ɓe ittini ɗum elektronji"" which translates to ""Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed.""
"
Girkan bojon binwadum dum vodai vanguno sembi lions?,"Based on the passage and the options, the most relevant answer is **A: Bedo wada hunde bosaji**.

Here's why:

* **The passage mentions ""boosaaji (amma patuje walader) ha halkugoo mo be nangi fu.""** This directly translates to something akin to ""spiders (but dangerous types) for killing them by catching all of it"". Thus, option A is closely related to what is found in the passage.
* Other options do not directly correspond to information found in the passage.

Therefore, **A** is the most logical choice.
"
Girkan kojon lonludo toi on je soiderta yeccugo hali lion?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is likely **C: Worbe be robo pedo dabita dabba wol wati**.

Here's why:

*   **P** discusses societal values related to women and how they are raised. It talks about respect, family, and a focus on female kinship.

*   **Q** asks about the Girkan Kojon and what is being said about him.

*   **C** directly discusses the position of men and women, which resonates with the issues raised in P. This answer fits the broader theme of relationships and societal dynamics between men and women.

Therefore, option C seems the most contextually relevant response to Q based on the information provided in P."
Beburi nangugo boji peton?,"Based on the description, the passage refers to ""patuuji petel petel"" (small birds). Therefore, the answer is:

**A: Patiru Petel**
"
Patiji peton do nonga dabbaji toi?,"The correct answer is **A: Dabbaji petel**.

The passage states that ""fatuji petel petel (haabe je majji daga sare) je nyamata kujeji petel"" which translates to ""small birds (whose group comes from the bush) that eat small things."" Thus, they are small animals."
Hander limtadido toi en wala ha nder labi nangugo dabaji?,"The correct answer is **C: Bedo dabita daba petel jamma**

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Ɓe wawan ɓe lara der nyimre jemma, bo ɓe ɗo dilla be hakkilo sossai"". This translates to ""They can see in the darkness of night, and they move with great caution."" This directly supports the idea that they hunt at night.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: Nostugo nokkure mabbe** (Adaptation to their environment): While Ocelots do adapt to their environment, the passage focuses more on their hunting techniques.
*   **B: Bedo tokka Dabbaji wati** (They follow animals): While ocelots hunt animals, the passage doesn't emphasize them *following* animals over long distances. It highlights their ambush tactics.
*   **D: Beburi watugo hakkillo ha dabba petel** (They are more cautious about small animals): The passage mentions caution but it isn't limited to only small animals.

"
Gojon lonludo toi on je wawata fama ocelot? ,"The text describes ocelots as hunters of small prey, hunting at night, and being careful. Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Bewawi nonguge daba jemma** - This translates to ""They can see at night"". The passage states, ""Ɓe wawan ɓe lara der nyimre jemma,"" meaning they can see in the dark. This aligns with the text.
*   **B: Be do dilla hakkilo** - This translates to ""They walk carefully"". The passage says, ""ɓe ɗo dilla be hakkilo sossai"", meaning they move with great care. This also aligns with the text.
*   **C: Hakkillo mabe wala sembe** - This translates to ""Their intelligence is weak"". The passage does not suggest this.
*   **D: Beburi yuduso onanga daba petel** - This translates to ""They prefer to catch small prey"". This is explicitly mentioned in the first sentence.

The question asks *which* quality helps us understand ocelots. Options A, B, and D are all accurate, However, the best answer is **A: Bewawi nonguge daba jemma**, which, translated, means **They can see at night.** This is correct because the prompt mentions they hunt at night.

Therefore, the best answer is **A**."
Girkan kojon lolludo wala ha nder patiwa manga je mari semba?,"Based on the context provided in P, the answer is most likely **C: Diwugo**.

Here's why:

*   **P describes a powerful, well-rounded athlete and mentions features like strength, agility and hunting related terms.**
*   **The question in Q talks about an ability or skill within a large arena of strength.**
*   **""Diwugo"" likely translates to ""running"" or ""sprinting"" which aligns with the described traits.**

The other options are less likely:

*   **Vauso** Doesn't seem related to hunting, agility, or large strength arenas.
*   **Fodugo:** It's unclear whether it relates to running/agility.
*   **Holo:** Does not seem to relate to running/agility."
Ha nder bolwadum keferetiri tigers bbe Lions?,"Based on the provided text snippets, the most logical answer is **A: No be Wawi Voluga**.

Here's why:

*   The initial paragraph in ""P"" describes physical attributes related to strength and prowess, mentioning powerful animals.
*   Question ""Q"" asks if the things mentioned are Tigers and Lions.
*   The most logical way to fit together is to mention physical attributes related to agility and strength.
*   Option A refers to how they are agile.
*   The other answers are less relevant to the question, and the general topic.

Therefore, the most likely correct answer is **A**."
Ha nder bolwadumde dume Robert Hooke wading hiddeko kala Biologists?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is:

The passage states that Robert Hooke was the first person to observe ""ɗaaɗi watinga,"" which translates to ""dead cells.""
"
"""Kovitte asali kalma “Cell"""" nufata?""","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is:

*   **D: Wasu (Play)**
"
Nder boiwadumdo kovitte dabbaji fere mara?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: Ngandi (Intelligence)**.

The passage states that animals are different because they possess ""gandi"" (intelligence).
"
Dume wallititta leddi hali sa'e wadugo photosynthesis?,"Based on the passage, the answer is **D: nange (sun)**.

The passage states ""Legal ɗo fuɗa nyamdu to ɗum heɓi nange"" which translates to ""Plants start making food when they get sunlight.""  This directly links sunlight to the process of food production (photosynthesis) in plants.
"
Dume hembi fofata yasi jei ledde fofat ɗer?,"Based on the text:

This translates to: ""The air humans breathe out, trees breathe in, and they breathe out carbon dioxide that humans release (that is, they breathe it out).""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **D: Carbondioxide**"
"iga habar, girkan kojinta toi o nandi hadata lawol evaluakon?","Based on the text, the best answer is **C: Jama're do tokkindira hakide hedi kesum**. Here's why:

The passage describes a process where a population moves to a new environment, adapts to it, and eventually becomes distinct from the original population. This process is called ""speciation,"" which is the formation of new species.

Let's break down why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: mofterde famarɗe je jama'aje dolliri ha ɓaɓal kesal** While the passage mentions the formation of a new environment, the key aspect of speciation is the adaptation and eventual reproductive isolation leading to a new species.

*   **B: Nokkure jama'are sedda eggo be loro be hed kesum** The passage focuses on the divergence of populations, not just a change in location and climate.

*   **D: Jama'are wore be hut be ɗiɗi** This option is irrelevant to the topic in the passage.

The key phrase in option C is ""**Jama're do tokkindira hakide hedi kesum**"" (Communities begin to distinguish the new climate). It directly reflects the core idea of speciation, where a population evolves distinct characteristics in response to a new environment."
Girkan ogon lanlodu toi on lataki ye vanginta lawol speciation? ,"Based on the provided text, the best answer is:

**A: Dafte'a to jama'are kesum saldore**

Here's why:

The passage describes speciation as the process where a group is isolated, adapts to a new environment, and eventually becomes a distinct species. This aligns with the idea that speciation is related to differences in new environment.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Dum caddum ha lawol evolution:** It is easy in the process of evolution.
*   **C: Do tokkindirki be laɓi kesum:** This is related to the new environment but less directly than differences in a new environment.
*   **D: Vangiki mudum lataki:** Although it causes change, but it is not directly related to the process of Speciation.

**In summary:** Speciation is defined by a isolated population being different in environment, making option A the correct answer."
Girkan laɓi toi on yarata nɗiƴam o berndi?,"The question ""Girkan laɓi toi on yarata nɗiƴam o berndi?"" translates to ""What part carries blood to the heart?""

The passage P describes blood flow and mentions ""dadi"" (vessels).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **B: Daɗiŋyiyam (Blood Vessels)**

So the answer is **B**.
"
Toi ɗer paali famɗugo ha wanshore der yi'am?,"Based on the context of the passage provided, the correct answer is likely **C: Dadi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes blood flowing through the heart and then ""dadi daadaaji den wartaa ha bernde hedi dadol-ii'amwol"". This suggests ""dadi"" are vessels or structures involved in the blood flow returning to the heart.

Therefore, the best fit is **C: Dadi**."
wawugo kowowe tagga bileji muon ta ɗer bendan toi tokkidi?,"Based on the passage, the answer is **B: Hedi shudiɗum**.

The passage states: ""Ɓurna fara ɗo wawa maɓɓugo bileji maɓɓe hedi ɓawo ha ɓandu maɓɓe"" which translates to ""Most importantly, they can fold their wings back against their bodies.""  ""Hedi shudiɗum"" is the closest match to this description.
"
Girkan kojo lanlodo toi on limto ka ha habauji je vennata fiwugo kewowo?,"The correct answer is **A: Tastugo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes creatures that fly and use flight for various purposes (escaping predators, finding food/friends, and carrying things).
*   The question asks what is an advantage of being able to fly as described in the first passage.
*   **Tastugo** means *to explore* or *to investigate*, which is a skill enhanced by flight. The passage says that flying enables the creatures to explore a large territory and find things such as food and friends.
*   Other options don't relate to the benefits described in the passage:
    *   **Jutal yonki** means *living long* or *longevity*.
    *   **Mofturu nƴamdo** means *gathering food* or *collecting food*.
    *   **Ɗuduki** means *multiplying* or *increasing*."
Girkan kojun isolodu toi lataki be dinosaurs?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: kosɗe marɗepeɗeli**.

The text states: ""...Be ɗo mari kosɗe be ɓaandu be peeɗeli..."" which translates to ""...They have legs, body, and feathers...""

Therefore, having legs with feathers is a characteristic that the described creature shares with dinosaurs.
"
Girkn kujon lonludo toi on sandirake be sholli be dinosaurs?,"The passage describes creatures that share characteristics with dinosaurs like having legs, bodies, feathers, laying eggs, and walking on two legs like a T-Rex.  The question asks what physical features are similar between these creatures and dinosaurs.

Option D, ""kosɗe ɗe pedeli"" (legs and feathers), is the most accurate answer because the passage specifically mentions these characteristics being shared.

Therefore, the answer is **D: kosɗe ɗe pedeli**.
"
"Daga bindoul, toi nder banɗu leggal cyad wawan lata triceratops buri handugo nyama?","The correct answer is **C: Dadi**.

The passage states that scientists believe Triceratops ate cycads. It also says ""Fuwobe illimu kimiya be fasaha fere yamyamtindiri fuunngoji fere do mari tokna gam mai tsadan wodi Dinosaur nyami dum,"" which translates to ""Scientists also suspect that parts of the cycads contain toxins, which is why only certain dinosaurs would eat them."" And given the context of the passage, the toxins would likely be in the **seeds/dadi**.
"
Nder belwadudo girkan kojon lo indo toiom be buri yidugo be nƴamdo? ,"Based on the passage, here's the breakdown and the correct answer:

The passage states that scientists believed Triceratops ate **cycads**, a type of plant common during the Cretaceous period.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Ɓaatedam (Baatedam):** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: Benɗiti audi (Benditi audi):** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Aku:** The passage says even today animals can eat plants with toxins like Aku
*   **D: Audi barowol (Audi barowol):** The passage says that it looked like it had laggal manja or a beak, meaning audi barowol did NOT have that feature.

Therefore, the best answer based on the passage is **B: Benɗiti audi**."
Nder bolwadumdo fijirde sports fui on be buri andugo?,"The text focuses heavily on football (ball kosde), mentioning Italy and Germany's success in it, including winning the FIFA World Cup in 2006.  The other sports are listed as examples of sports, but not given any particular weight in terms of popularity.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Ball kosde**
"
Hander boilawoidumdo girkan fijirde toi em on nƴami arandere ha hali?,"Based on the provided text, the answer is **A: Ball kosde** (Ball kosde = Football/Soccer).

The passage states ""fijobe ball kosde je leddi Italy, be bo je fijobe ball kosde je leddi Jamus"" which directly translates to ""football players from Italy, and also football players from Germany"". This clearly establishes that the passage is talking about football.
"
Ha mofuru toi on lexumbourg wati Belgian?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **(B) Wailurugu lamu Belgian**.

The passage states: ""Ha hande babe fere je Belgium do der Luxembourg ha bawo amma warti der Belgium bawo ummugo himbe Belgium."" This translates to something like: ""Initially, parts of Belgium were in Luxembourg, but later became part of Belgium following the Belgian revolution.""
"
Dume don girkan be vonnata waili-waili Luxembourg?,"The correct answer is **D: Laddi mari enchin kai**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Luxembourg kodai do habda dara ha chaka amma leddi Jamus nyaami be ha habre duniya I be habre duniya II pat.""  This translates to Luxembourg was neutral during the war, but Germany took it over during World War I and World War II.  This demonstrates a lack of its own strong defense.
"
Kilometers noi Turkey mari je ɗon har Europe?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**

The passage states: ""(23,764 square kilometer) (9,174 sq mi) ha Europe."" This means Turkey has 23,764 square kilometers in Europe.
"
"Dume dan geccitowo, shaka jafugo Turkiya?","The question asks about the approximation of the length of Turkey's borders. From the text: ""Iyakaji Turkey ɓuri kilometres 1,600 (1,000 mi) jutugo..."".  Therefore, the correct answer is **D: 1000**.  The question is specifically referring to the approximation in miles."
Dengal toi latin naftirta ha Vatican city?,"The correct answer is **A: Biki dena** (Bangleji dina).

The text says: ""Latin on be naftirta ha bangleji dina."" which translates to ""Latin is used in religious ceremonies"".
"
Ha Vatican city dume on Italian naftirta?,"The correct answer is **D: Volde je kullum**

The text says, ""Italian fu kanjum on yaare je himbe je huwata ha wuro man volwata kullum..."" which translates to ""Italian is what the people who work in the city use to speak daily..."" Therefore, Italian is used for everyday speech.
"
Hender bolwadoum do girkan kojin lonludotci on marifamu ha holo computerji?,"The passage discusses several uses of computers, including:

*   Storing photos and videos
*   Playing games
*   Creating special effects for TV and movies
*   Recording music and audio

The question asks what is difficult to achieve on computers. The passage states ""...bo irin hundeji mai ndu ɓedde ha be naftirta ha teleji be filmji Burna fu gimol be do wada rikoodin man be kompuutaji nyadde heba **hauta dum bo jilla sauti man wonnda**."" which translates to ""...and those things are increasingly used in TV and movies, and **it is difficult for computers to combine them and make the sound one**.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Hautugo (Combining)**."
Dume don gaccitedu sareji duddum je hedija mabbe mari gada zamanu?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Monhejo daro**.

The passage states that Wuroji Harappa be Mohenjo-daro (Harappa and Mohenjo-daro) had advanced sewage systems, therefore, Mohenjo-daro is a large city that had a sewage system from that time.
"
Ha nder hadiji tokkobe toi hebatata kare sarrufugo ndiƴam ye zamanni?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Haraappa**.

The text specifically mentions that Harappa had ""useful drainage systems"" and ""advanced plumbing facilities in almost every house."" The other options are mentioned in relation to other sanitation practices, but Harappa is the only one directly associated with advanced plumbing and drainage.
"
Dume don girkan je watata skater wailitta?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is:

**A: Ko wuri ha less skater blade**

The passage describes how the skater leans to turn.  The amount of pressure the skater places on either of the blade, causes the skater to turn.
"
Nder boilawadum do girkan kujon lonlido jo'an wolwat ha zamanu kankara skate?,"Based on the provided text (which appears to be in a West African language, likely Fulfulde), the passage describes a skater using skates. The key details are:

*   The skates have two sharp blades.
*   The blades are shaped to allow the skater to turn.
*   If the right skate is tight, the skater turns right, and vice versa.

Given this description, we need to match it to the answer options. Without a perfect understanding of the source language, here's how we can best deduce the answer:

*   **We are looking for a term or description that relates to ice skating/skates or their usage.**

Now consider the answer choices (translated to English):

*   A: Two Blades
*   B: Wuruki (This likely doesn't have to do with this skate)
*   C: Concave
*   D: Sumira (This likely doesn't have to do with this skate)

**Reasoning:**

*   Option A, ""Two Blades,"" directly aligns with the text's mention of two sharp blades on the skates. The blades are very important for the skate.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is **A: Wutudu didebre (Two Blades)**."
Nder boiwadum do kovitte lawol je atoms jitata sembe yite?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: Hotoji**.

The passage discusses photons being emitted from substances with energy and how these photons relate to the energy emitted. While the other options are related to the general concept, the question specifically asks what type of objects emit energy from atoms, and the passage directly states that photons are the tiny objects related to atoms that emit energy.
"
Ko latata atom houta photon?,"Based on the provided text, the most fitting answer is:

**B: Yufugo sembe energy**

Here's why:

*   The text discusses how light or radiation causes the release of photons, which are described as packets of energy (the term 'sembe' in this context can be translated as 'energy' or 'power').
*   It states that objects can possess energy that they release, and that photons released are smaller than atoms.

Therefore, the release of a photon by an atom corresponds to the release or transfer of energy."
Nder bolwadumdo dumo on lata ta tiye bulbdaca huwogo?,"Based on the information provided in P, the correct answer is **D: Be tokki yiti lantarki nder socket**.

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes the danger of electrical shock from the socket if you touch it while it's live. The passage warns about touching the socket while electricity is still flowing.
*   The other options don't directly address the safety concern highlighted in the passage:

    *   A: While true in general, the passage focuses on the immediate danger during bulb replacement.
    *   B: The passage doesn't discuss the risk of using a metal bulb in a socket but focuses on the socket itself.
    *   C: Also correct but not mentioned in the given passage.

The question asks what should be done to ensure the bulb works, and the best option is that the electricity is turned on to the socket.

Therefore, the answer is **D**."
Girikon gojun toi on mari hassasi memugo to be wari chanjugo yinta?,"The correct answer is **B: Hedi kunnugo yite**.

Here's why:

* The passage emphasizes the importance of disconnecting the power supply (""kuje kunnugo hite man sey to ɓe nyifi ko be itta ɗum ha hite"") before changing the light bulb. This is the primary safety precaution.
* The passage warns of electric shock if you touch the socket or the metal base of the bulb while it's energized. This reinforces the need to disconnect the power first.
* The other options are less relevant:
    * **A: Sembe yite (Light Intensity)** is not directly related to safety when changing a bulb.
    * **C: Hedi jodugo bulb (Bulb holder type):** is information, but not related to safety procedure.
    * **D: Cable mai (Cable damage)** is not the direct focus of the safety instruction.

Therefore, understanding and adhering to the procedure for disconnecting the power is the most critical safety aspect when changing a light bulb.
"
Nder bolwadumdo kofe se sendugo nucleus?,"Based on the prompt, the most accurate answer is:

**B: Be yofi energy**

**Explanation:**

The passage states that splitting a nucleus releases energy (""accugo sembe man seɗɗa""). Therefore, option B directly reflects this information.
"
Girkan toi on vangaki daga ko sali dega ko sali,"Based on the provided text and the question, the answer is **A: Telescope**.

The text explains that people use telescopes to observe celestial objects: ""...ngam man to yimɓe teffata aandal duniya yiɗi lara kujeji asama man ɓe naftiran **teleskop** gam ɓandu asamu duniya man sanjan ngam yite wurtata ha ɓandu man.""  This translates to ""...that people seek knowledge of the world wish to see celestial objects they use **telescopes** to the body of the world change to fire erupts in the body.""
"
Girkan toi on be naftirta hateles?,"Based on the information in passage P, the correct answer is **D: Satelites buri liakund 100 high**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Do hosa jirgi man je vurtata duniyaru je yotti jutugo kosde 100 to be yidi watugo tauraro himbe ko kuje larugo dayudum ha do."" This translates to ""You need rockets that launch from Earth reaching altitudes of 100 feet or more to see human stars or the best things to see."" This clearly refers to objects at high altitudes. Since ""tauraro himbe"" or human stars, usually refer to satellites, this supports the answer ""satelites buri liakund 100 high"" or ""satellites more than 100 high"".

Let me know if you'd like a further breakdown of why the other options are incorrect."
Girkan toi caka cyclical event do saluki wakkati?,"Based on the passage and the question, the best answer is:

**A: Wakkati**

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses ""wakkati"" (time) extensively.
*   The question asks about the cyclical nature of an event regarding ""wakkati"".
*   Therefore, ""wakkati"" is the most logically connected and relevant answer to the question within the context of the passage."
Dume on gecidow wakaati nafturgo computes?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Jutugo**.

The passage discusses a time when things are changing rapidly (""kujeji do fe’a sala daga yeso yahugo jotta yehugo nane""). It also mentions that time helps us understand that something has ""fe'i (Juutugo)"".

The passage implies that **Juutugo** (which means ""change"") is a characteristic of the current time being discussed. While the other options might be related to understanding or making sense of the changes, ""change"" is the most direct and accurate answer based on the text.
"
Heinder bolwadum do hakkil be hendu lamu?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **A: Maron 2:2 degree**.

The passage states that Charles ""wurtibe be 2:2 (digri je ɗiɗabre)"", which translates to ""he graduated with a 2:2 (second-class degree)"".
"
Nder ko anani ha boulwadum charles hanko fuddi wadugo dume?,"The correct answer is **D: Gangi ha trinity college**.

The passage clearly states: ""...ha makaranta mauɓe je Triniti je woni Kambrij Chals jangi hala al ada himɓe be hala kujeji himɓe zamanu nane mahi..."". This translates to ""...at Trinity College Cambridge Charles studied archaeology and anthropology...""

While he did join the army later (option A), and has a degree (option C, though the passage indicates his grade), the passage explicitly states he studied at Trinity College. Option B is incorrect because while archaeology was *part* of what he studied, it wasn't the *only* thing.
"
Ha Trygvasson lesdi fleet dume?,"The correct answer is **D: Norway**.

The passage states that Olaf Trygvsson was a ""volwowo yare (Norway)"" which translates to ""king of Norway"". Therefore, his fleet would be from Norway.
"
Ha wakkati habaruji kugal sam sembi seddi Aladaji estonia?,"The passage states that the cultural influence of Germany in Estonia was strong in the 15th century (the 1400s). The question asks how long ago this was.

Today is 2024.  The 1400s were roughly 600 years ago.

Therefore the answer is C: Hakkundi dubi 600 sali
"
Yareji Estonia sembe be duma?,"The correct answer is **B: Kalmaji German**.

The passage states that German influence was strong in 15th century Estonia and that the letter ""Õ/õ"" was added due to this influence. It also mentions that over time, many words from German coalesced into the Estonian language. Therefore, German words (kalmaji German) are a key part of the German influence on Estonian.
"
Handel bolwadum do limtadi aniye hinde lindi volwata haɗo kudeji?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: Be limtai be to beɗo famayare di (They are counted if they understand the language)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Adadu Himɓe wolwata yaare wuro man lattan ɗuɗɗum ko seɗɗa gam to ɓe ɗo lima be himɓe wawi yare nandi ɗum."" This translates to ""The number of people who speak the language in their native country is high or low, because they are counted with those who can understand the language.""
*   The passage also mentions the similarity between Hindi and Urdu, stating that speakers can generally understand each other in everyday conversation.

The other options are less accurate:

*   A: Similarity is a factor, but understanding is the key criterion.
*   B: While Urdu speakers contribute to the overall figure, it's not simply about whether they speak Urdu. The understanding factor applies to all speakers.
*   D: Reading ability is not explicitly mentioned as the deciding factor for inclusion in the count. Understanding is."
Girkan koso lonludo tobon haɗo yareji hindi be urdu?,"Based on the provided text, the best answer is:

**C: Bedo nandi ha andal befamu**

Here's why:

The text states that Hindi and Urdu are very similar when spoken, making it easy for speakers to understand each other in daily conversation: ""Yare Hindu be Urdu ɗo nandi sosai to a wolwan ɗum amma windi man bo wurtan ferefere, be wolde kullum be kullum ɓe ɗo wawa famugo hore maɓɓe."" This translates to ""Hindi and Urdu are very similar when spoken, but the writing is different, and in daily speech, they can understand each other.""

Let's break down why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Do senderi hakkunde volwobe yareji** - While there might be some differences or variations between speakers of different dialects, the main idea presented is mutual intelligibility.
*   **B: Bedo feretiri ha andal** - The passage specifies that they can understand each other.
*   **D: Be ferotiri ha famu** - This contradicts the passage's main point about mutual intelligibility.

Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer."
Girkan kojun lon hun toi mari andal ha kalimaji Hangeul?,"The most correct and comprehensive answer based on the text is **A: Be assisi ha zamanu lamɗo sejong's reign**.

Here's why:

*   The text clearly states that Hangeul was created during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450)."
Kalimaji Hunmin Jeongeum chanji yago dume?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

The passage states: ""Asali o indi Hangeul baleeri Hunmin Jeongeum..."", which means ""Originally it was called Hangeul but also Hunmin Jeongeum..."" This indicates that Hunmin Jeongeum was the original name that later changed to Hangeul.
"
Nder bolwadumdo yare toi on mari sembe ha Sanskrit?,"The correct answer is **D: Yare Indian**.

The passage states that Sanskrit is an important language that has influenced many modern Indian languages. Therefore, it has a strong connection to Indian languages. While Latin and European languages have some similarities to Sanskrit, the primary influence described in the passage is on Indian languages.
"
Nder bolwadum nafturgo sanskrit be woggi gam dumen?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: Egugo Aryan**.

The text explicitly states that Sanskrit came to India with the migration of the Aryans: ""gotel der man on do eggugo Aryan daga hirna yahugo india mo wardi be demgal mabbe""
"
Nder volwadumdo causon on toi mari aniyi gravity ha lo?,"The correct answer is **B: sembe lo'a do va sosai ngam seddi** (The gravity of the planet is very low because it is small).

Here's why:

* **Understanding the Passage:** The passage states that on this planet (Lo), a person who weighs 90 kg on Earth would only weigh 16 kg. This indicates a significantly weaker gravitational pull.
* **Gravity and Mass:** Gravity is directly related to mass. Smaller mass means weaker gravity.
* **Analyzing the Options:**
    * **A:** While the *effect* is that Earth's gravity seems small *from* Lo, the cause is the reverse. Lo's gravity is small, not Earth's.
    * **B:** This accurately describes the situation: Lo has weak gravity because it is small (has less mass).
    * **C:** This is the opposite of the truth. If Lo were big, it would have *more* gravity.
    * **D:** This is incorrect. Earth's gravity isn't affected by Lo. Lo's gravity is the key difference.

Therefore, option B best explains the reason for the reduced weight on the planet Lo.
"
Ner bolwadumdu girkan kojen hala boddum je dule yasi layer?,"Based on the descriptions provided:

*   **P (in the first language):** describes the lunar crust, how it's composed of rocks and minerals, its thickness (thinner under maria, thicker under highlands), and how it can be much younger near maria due to lava flows.

*   **Q (in the second language):** asks what is an old volcanic rock that is under the layer.

The best answer among the choices is:

*   **A: Kobaɗi ha sera gomodum crust** which translates to ""The crust is very thick.""

**Reasoning:**

The description in P emphasizes the difference in crustal thickness between maria (thin) and highlands (thick). The question asks about the crust under the volcanic rock, which implies the older crust underneath the volcanic rock is **B** (Crusts les highlads)
"
Nder boiwadumdo toi dule crust the gomodum?,"Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:

**D: Ha les maria**

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Buri sewugo ha les maria man bo buri tekkugo ha les leddi towinga"" meaning it's thinner under the maria (maria translates to ""seas"") and thicker under the highlands.
"
Nder bolwadumdo toi on yerdi ladi ha nokkure jama'are?,"The correct answer is **D: Wodi famɗinki trillions hakkinde stars (There is a distance of trillions between stars)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Chaka man be luttuɓe hoodere 'wondiiɓe' en yottan mails triliyon"" which translates to ""The distance between that star and the other 'companion' stars is trillions of miles.""

The other options are relevant but not directly answering the question about the location of a community or a place:
*   A is correct, but does not contain the correct information for the question.
*   B is correct, but does not contain the correct information for the question.
*   C is correct, but does not contain the correct information for the question."
Ko wartaha iga to ha geso caka nange?,"Based on the provided passage P, the correct answer is:

**A: Plasma**

The passage mentions ""Hendu gas may ɗon famɗita to a ɗon daya daga cakka naange,"" which translates to ""Gas turns into plasma when it is heated in the center of the sun."" Therefore, the material at the center of the sun that heats up and becomes plasma is gas.
"
Nder bolwatumdo girkan nokkure nange toi on vangini nangi?,"The correct answer is **B: Do plasma**

Here's why:

* **P** describes the photosphere as what we see of the sun, and it's made of plasma. In the passage, there is no mention of any of the other given options.

Therefore, **B: Do plasma** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage.
"
Girkan kojon lonlude toi on fami valliti tobbitini copernicus theory?,"The passage says that the phases of Venus support the Copernican theory of planets revolving around the sun. Therefore, the answer is **C: Nange do nande be venus** (The sun is in the middle with Venus).
"
Girkan kojo toi on Galileo Galilei ha 1610?,"Based on the provided passage (P), Galileo Galilei observed phases of Venus similar to the moon in 1610. This observation supported the Copernican theory which states that planets revolve around the sun.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Hakunde venus**
"
der boiwadumdo mo nƴami mayo amazon jabata nɗiƴam?,"The correct answer is **C: Mayo manga** (Big river).

The passage explicitly states that ""Kashi nogas je dyam rufata daga dyam ji duniyaru nasta mayo manga manga do wara daga Amazon on."" This translates to ""Twenty percent of the world's fresh water flows into the big river coming from the Amazon.""
"
Nder toi tokkidi accolade Mayo Amazon?,"The correct answer is **C: Mayo buri jutugo** (The longest river).

The passage states: ""Mayo Amazon je asali yotti 6387km(3,980 miles)"" which means the Amazon River's length is approximately 6387km (3,980 miles). This refers to its length, making it the ""longest river"".
"
Hatoi be limti huwobe buri famdugo ha Venezuelans?,"The correct answer is **C: Ŋebbam (Nyebbam)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Kampani mari nafu je **nyebbam** ha Venezuela..."" (Companies that profit from **oil** in Venezuela...).
*   Question P asks about employment sectors of Venezuelan migrants.
*   It then states that only 1% of oil companies operate, and there is widespread underemployment.

Therefore the most appropriate context for Q is employment relating to *oil* or *oil companies*.

The other options aren't as directly connected to the context of Venezuelan employment in the passage:

*   A: Jaŋgdemɗemri: This option does not appear to relate specifically to the passage.
*   B: Kamfani: (Company) This is a general term and not specific like the context of oil companies.
*   D: Kude: (things) This option does not appear to relate specifically to the passage."
Helwe belwadumdo nokkure toi on mari huwobe dudum ha venezuelans?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: Ŋebbam (Nyebbam - Oil)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Kampani mari nafu je **nyebbam** ha Venezuela, je leddi man do vurtina dum, ko be kashi gotel on huwata nder temere ha kampani **nyebbam** man."" This translates to ""Oil companies in Venezuela, which the country exports, are the only ones operating at full capacity."" It implies a concentration of economic activity and, consequently, likely employment within the oil sector, even with the challenges mentioned.

The other options are less directly supported:

*   A: Kude (Kuje): While the passage mentions that some Venezuelans are working in various areas, no information in the paragraph indicates that Kuje is the leading employment sector.
*   B: Jaŋgdemɗemri (Jaŋde): No information indicates that Jaŋde is the leading employment sector.
*   C: Kamfani (Kamfani): There are mentions of companies, but no definitive statement indicating they are the area where many Venezuelans are employed."
"Iga habar, nder toi tokkidi fussion do stars be?","Based on the given information, the correct answer is **D: Hautugo hydrogen atoms** (Fusion of hydrogen atoms).

Here's why:

* **P clearly states:** ""...Tauraro do hokka hiite be guldum gam sembe je hebata to gabbere hydrogen hauti (ko takki) be horemajum gam hauta kuje je buri teddugo."" This translates to: ""...Stars release heat and light with the energy they get when hydrogen atoms fuse together (stick together) to form heavier elements.""

Therefore, Q (What is the process of fusion in stars?) is answered by D (Fusion of hydrogen atoms).
"
Girkan kojum londu detin on mari na fu ha nokkure vonnuga hendu?,"Based on the passage P, hydrogen is used to create heavier elements. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Hydurogin**

The passage mentions ""gabbere hydrogen hauti (ko takki) be horemajum gam hauta kuje je buri teddugo"" which translates to something along the lines of ""hydrogen combines (or fuses) with itself to create heavier elements.""
"
Ko woni chemical hautugo ndiyam?,"The correct answer is **D: Hydrogen ɗiɗi atom be oxygen atom gotel**.

The chemical formula for water is H2O, meaning it has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
"
Ha ndiƴam banji dode kolutta ta hader?,"Based on the information provided in passage P, here's why the answer is likely **D: diyamɗiyamjoum nitrogen** (liquid nitrogen):

*   **Passage P describes something that exists as both a gas and a liquid, and that the liquid form is denser but has the same molecular structure.** This is a characteristic of liquid nitrogen (diyamɗiyamjoum nitrogen).

Therefore, **D: diyamɗiyamjoum nitrogen** is the most logical answer."
Nder bolwadum do girkan kojon lonludu toi on wala nder state ngam wadugo dokaji?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Tedudum vitudum wuro dokaji**.

Here's why:

* **The passage clearly states:**  ""...be Saare Majalusa on tan hawti gomnati majum- ha les Defte tsari Lesdi."" This translates to something like ""Only the House of Assembly is involved in government according to the constitution.""
* **""Tedudum vitudum wuro dokaji""** likely refers to the House of Assembly or a similar legislative body responsible for making laws.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Soiɗe sembe sodar dukkal** - This suggests something related to military power, which isn't connected to law-making in the context.
* **C: Jabitadi yidel jabudum** - This implies something related to a judge or court, not necessarily the body that creates laws.
* **D: Ardido je walader lisdo** - This indicates a religious leader, which is not typically the entity primarily responsible for legislation in a government.

Therefore, option A is the most logical choice given the information presented in the passage.
"
Nxer bolwadum girkan on jabani state wakaati gomnati ha zamanu konu revolitionary?,"Based on the passage (P), the best answer is **B: Hakkutugo ha articles do dagiri sembe lamu je subadum**.

Here's why:

*   The passage strongly implies that the government lacks certain powers due to the constitution (""Defte tsari Lesdi""). It mentions limitations on their ability to collect taxes (""haraaji""), enforce laws without judicial authority (""maudo ha korowal ko alkali""), and impose certain types of levies (""doka cede lampo be cede nastungo kare chaka wuro be wuro""). The passage is very clearly pointing to the limitations that the law places on government power.

The other options are less relevant:

*   A: Haraji kautal state dokaji is about taxes, which is mentioned but is a specific symptom, not the root cause.
*   C: Ardido lasdi don tefa larugo implies the leader is doing something. The passage discusses legal limitations, not the leaders' efforts.
*   D: Gomnati lisdi hauti jungo ɗiɗi be lesdiji fere suggests that local government works together with other state entities which is not mentioned in the context.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **B.**
"
Noi kalimaji ha bawo enche?,"Based on the text provided, the answer is **C: Waihiti les**.

The passage states: ""Bindi wangi ha karshi derewol man, dow do wailiti les."" This translates to ""The writing is at the bottom of the document, where it is mirrored.""

Therefore, the words on the back are written in reverse.
"
Hustugo Singapore hader girgato?,"Based on the information provided, the answer is **C: sautaarehuŋide fijirde**.

The passage in P talks about a place in Singapore where people could go to enjoy themselves and return with joy to their homes, and also mentions Vanda Miss Joaquim being chosen as the national flower.

Q asks about a Singapore **girgato**.

The best fit for ""girgato"" is a **sautaarehuŋide fijirde** which means a place of play/entertainment.
"
Dume en vanda miss Joaqium?,"Based on the passage:

*   The passage states that in 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim was chosen as the flower to represent the country (Singapore).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **B: Gene boɗɗon** (Beautiful flower)

The passage is talking about the national flower, so ""beautiful flower"" is the most logical answer.
"
Nder dum bolwadum toi beri gazi ardido jeguri vedugo kessum ha lisdi lamu Egyptian?,"Based on the information in passage P, the Egyptians of the New Kingdom were marvelled by the ""size"" of the predecessors' monuments. So the answer is **C: The Size**.
"
"Ko Shafi Ba'al Kaanuɓe, To We dabbayi, Ya mpɓe Geene Dillaayi, Gamma Difol Diyam?","Based on the provided text (which seems to be in Fulfulde or a related language), the question is likely asking ""Which direction do the animals migrate to?"".

The text states they migrate ""hirnange babal, tsallika je mara kumbawal, daga hirnange tondire je yende"" which translates to ""west plains, searching for watering holes, from the western slopes"". This clearly indicates a westward direction.

Therefore, the best answer is:

**A: Plantode Hirne (Westward Plane)**  While the wording might be slightly off due to translation, ""Hirne"" clearly relates to westward.
"
"Adir Kassa mOi, toyi Dabbahi Nyamobe, Gene Dilla Gamma Tifol Diyam?","The correct answer is **C: Moye mara**.

The text states that the migration eventually crosses the Mara River (ebbita mayo Mara). Therefore, Moye Mara (which likely translates to Mara River or Mara area) is the location mentioned in the question.
"
"Nokkure Sealion, Dun Nasdugi, gulle Denyeji?","The passage describes a battle where Germany tried to invade Britain after France fell. The name of the German operation was ""Operation Sealion.""

Therefore, the answer is **A: Almania (Germany)**
"
Kowadi Germany Fuddi Konuye Britain Be?,"The correct answer is **B: Nokkure Sealion** (Operation Sealion).

Here's why:

*   The passage describes Germany's plan to invade Britain after the fall of France.
*   It mentions the name of the German invasion plan as ""operasion rawandu dyam"", which translates to ""Operation Sealion""."
"Ko Walestum NoddoI Eder Ko Handi, Tsaroji Ifanliyen Edow Timinki Africanan?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is:

**C: Haitoki Nokkure launching pad**

The passage states that Italy wants to:

*   Take over countries in Africa.
*   Have a way to transport soldiers so that they can cross the Mediterranean Sea and invade Africa.
*   For this reason, they want to set up and filter (or control) Christian bases and airfields in Egypt.

Therefore, establishing a launching pad for their military operations is the correct interpretation of their aims in the region."
"Ko Shafi Toskarawol, ho Ol Ko Dun Wi Ada, Ko Ya Itadi Maudin Inheji Konu?","The correct answer is **A: Nongugo Lesdi Africa (Conquering African Countries)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage clearly states: ""Ko Italy buri yidugo lesde Afrika. be nanga lesde man, be mara haje marugo kuje lendata soja mabbe, gam soja en eera mayo Maalia be nasta Afrika."" This translates to ""Italy desires African countries. They want to capture those countries and control resources to support their soldiers, so the soldiers can cross the Mediterranean Sea and enter Africa.""

The other options are related to the overall plan, but the main driving force mentioned is the desire to conquer and control parts of Africa.

"Nder volwedum toron Herda, Daban Ji Mari na Futtader Tibrtan Mumugo?","Based on the passage, the answer is **B: Larnutugo Mantrans**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that Tibetan Buddhism incorporates practices from yoga, and specifically refers to Kundalini Yoga. While it describes aspects like meditation and visualization, it directly links these practices to achieving self-realization. ""Mantras"" are specific sounds or phrases repeated during meditation. These mantras act as a spiritual connection to help a person gain focus. Therefore, learning mantras is important when it comes to Kundalini Yoga.

The other options are less directly supported by the passage:

*   **A: Hollutugo Hautugo hundeji Hindel:** While Tibetan Buddhism has historical roots in India, the passage focuses more on yoga practices rather than detailed historical connections.
*   **C: Taskaram Kude:** This doesn't align with the practices described in the passage.
*   **D: Anidugo Yoyo Bale:** This is irrelevant to the content of the passage.

Therefore, **B: Larnutugo Mantrans** is the most appropriate answer based on the provided text."

Otoi on wudi suinde yite gan kugal tsunami?,"Based on the provided text, the places where the ambaliya (likely referring to a tsunami) occurred are Paga Poga and Niue. Tonga is mentioned as hearing about the potential tsunami, not necessarily being hit by it at that moment.

Therefore, the best answer related to a location where a tsunami *occurred* is:

*   **B: Niiue**"
Nder bolwedum no'on tanga valltr sambe wadata?,"Based on the passage, here's the breakdown and the correct answer:

* **P's Meaning:**  The passage discusses how information about a tsunami (due to an underwater earthquake) spread. It mentions that while Tonga eventually received the information, there was a delay, even though the PTWC (Pacific Tsunami Warning Center) issued warnings.  University recordings in Hawaii were also apparently disrupted.
* **Q's Meaning:** Question is asking what impact the event had on Tonga .

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Be waddi habruji wodi ko vanni (They brought information that wasn't current) -** This fits the context, as the information reaching Tonga was delayed, making it outdated. This is a strong possibility.

*   **B: Sambe doka hosatake ha hubarl saito tambitini (The authorities did not receive information to complete planning) -**This doesn't fully capture the problem. The issue was that the information was delayed, not that they didn't receive any information at all.

*   **C: Sea Level reading were affected -** Based on the text provided, there is not sufficient information to infer the sea level reading were affected.

*   **D: Authorities were unable to receive relevant warnings -**This is not fully true the text shows the warnings were received after a delay.

**Conclusion:**

The best answer is **A: Be waddi habruji wodi ko vanni (They brought information that wasn't current).**

*   P states: ""...Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq caught fire during an incident. Several prisoners claimed that they were subjected to abuse, claiming to have been mistreated and humiliated by their fellow prisoners, as well as US forces.""
*   Q asks: ""What are the consequences of the iraqi soldiers' abuses?""

The most relevant answer is:

*   **D: Heftigo Inmate Abuse** (Investigation of inmate abuse)

Here's why the other options aren't as suitable:

*   A: Be wati Yibe (They were imprisoned): This may be true but isn't necessarily *directly* related to the consequences of the abuses.
*   B: Ardido soja UN fiddi kugal (UN Military leader loses his job): This is possible but not directly derived from the prompt.
*   C: Fitininaji duddum wadi (Many conflicts occur): While prisoner abuse could *contribute* to conflict, it is not the direct consequence.

*   The passage P describes a tragic event in Mecca during the Hajj, mentioning the death of 15 people. The passage explicitly states that the deaths occurred in the holy city of Mecca during the Hajj pilgrimage.

The other options are not directly supported by the text or are demonstrably false:

*   A: wala halbuki hatsoraje (There is no truth in the story) - The passage presents the deaths as a factual event.
*   B: Hobɓe ben ɓe falbe gani be lesdi arab (Most of the dead were not from Arab countries) - The text states that most of the people present in the area were from Arab countries (""Himɓe jooɗi ha pellel suitaare petel yawanci maɓɓe himɓe leddi Arab en on"").
*   C: Hobbe ben be dondon husham hijju (The dead were wealthy pilgrims) - The passage does not provide any information about the economic status of the victims."
"ko shafi jabal jande, ko habaru a addu nautade dun acci a buɗi?","Based on the information provided, the best answer is:

*   **C: Hautugokaru koshafata dou duniyaro** (Impact of the satellite on the world)

Here's why:

*   The passage describes a satellite that is going to fall from the sky.
*   The key information in the passage indicates the risk of a satellite collision with the earth."
"Daga bindoul, dume fahn gidadɗoum yiɗi famtingoheba koshafi collsion?","Based on the provided text, the most relevant answer is **D: Ainihin daida karon (The exact date of the collision)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses tracking satellites, their capabilities, and monitoring their movements.
*   The question asks what information someone (presumably a researcher or authority) would want to know about a satellite collision.
*   Knowing the exact date of the collision is crucial for investigation, analysis, and potential mitigation efforts.

The other options are less directly related:

*   A: Moi jogota debrist tracking (Tracking the debris) - While important after a collision, the question asks about understanding the *collision* itself.
*   B: Noi hodere yawirta dillaki na wakkati karo (How the satellite will be damaged in the event of a collision) - While relevant to understanding the consequences of a collision, it doesn't address the core information needed to understand the collision event itself.
*   C: Joi bincitigo nafikaku sendirte (Searching for helpful information is important) - This option is vague. The main aim would be find the ""Ainihin daida karon""

Therefore, option D is the most appropriate answer."
"A Kisa do, babal toi batten hader maebe ngaudi Amerika'en?","The answer is **A: 400th**.

The passage states that Batten was in the 190th to 200th position on the 2008 list of 400 richest Americans. While his ranking was between 190th and 200th, he was still part of the group of **400** richest Americans.
"
Toi ɗer tokkidi batten wadi shahumoun ha mun?,"Based on the passage P, the correct answer is **B: University ha Virginia** and **D: Colleges hernata hollitidal arts Be Science**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states he graduated from the College Of Arts & Sciences at the University of Virginia."
Buoo toi on gomna arnold Schwarzenegger wati jude?,"The best answer that summarizes the provided information about Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's actions is:

*   **A: Fartugo ho sorugo ko wunjari haye je violet video fijirde je bikkoije kotatoi wuro california** (Which translates to: **Prohibiting the sale or rental of violent video games to minors in California**)

Here's why:

*   The passage clearly states that Schwarzenegger signed a law restricting the sale or rental of violent video games to minors. This is the core of the action taken.

Let's examine why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Sifa nuntugo waddi ragare marbe aibe** - It says that the characteristic of not buying, brought a negative consequence.
*   **C: A ban on the sale or rental of violent video games to minors outside of California** - The passage focuses *specifically* on California, not outside of it.
*   **D: A decal requirement in violent games** - A decal requirement is mentioned in the passage but is not the correct answer."
"Nder kissa mai, moi on nanai hala de be bolli a do mai?","Based on the provided text in P, the statement ""Duvall, mo bangi be pikkon didi maube, acca kuje manga je Miller numtata mo be mai"" implies a relationship or interaction between Duvall and Miller.

Therefore, the most likely correct answer is:

**D: Duvall**
"
"A kissamai, toi on nder didodo latti gonga miller gondini hanande mun?","Based on the limited information and the potential for misinterpretation due to language and context, it is difficult to be certain. However, let's analyze the question and possible answers:

The question (Q) asks: ""A kissamai, toi on nder didodo latti gonga miller gondini hanande mun?""  This seems to inquire: ""In essence, what of the two options is really Miller doing today?""

Now, analyze the options:

*   **A: Duwall hollo ra'ayi mun dau miller wakkati nande:** This means ""Duwall expresses his opinion on Miller at the time of hearing.""
*   **B: O larnai hakkilo mako, sainde o tas kudi:** This means ""He sharpens his mind, an indicator of counting money.""
*   **C: Mbikkoi durall volmi wane wakkati:** This looks incomplete but implies Durall is speaking at some time
*   **D: Olorni hakkilo mako soinde o taskudo:** This translates to ""He sharpens his mind since he is a tasker"".

Given that P mentions Miller wanting something, the most plausible answer is **D: Olorni hakkilo mako soinde o taskudo** because it implies that Miller is working diligently since he needs to.

"""Moiji sarwiti dou larnutuggo wade fahin ha """"laɓdoum hendou ga'ida""""?""","Based on the passage, Stephen Harper is the one who released the ""laɓɗum hendu ga'ida"" (clear air agenda).

Therefore, the answer is **D: Stephen Harper**
"
"""Moijo fewni dou latugo """"laɓdoum hendou ga'ida"""" nou hutiniraaka ha douɓe shupti kayefa?""","The correct answer is **A: Villitobe gomnati**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Stephen Harper ""japi o lendan Umrore Hendu Laɓɗum je ngomnati ha himɓe fu ɓe lara dum"". This directly translates to Stephen Harper launching a new government initiative ( ""laɓɗum hendou ga'ida"" = ""laɓdoum hendou ga'ida"") for everyone to see. The initiative is launched by the *government*.

Therefore, the correct answer is A: Villitobe gomnati."
Dume no the compounds cyanuric acid be melanine hauti touɗi reacted be gotel be gongel ha faturu shille?,"The correct answer is **C: kirisal** (crystals).

The passage states that the researchers found ""crystals hauti be sille faturu be beddugo je melamine be cyanuric acid"" which means ""crystals containing melamine and cyanuric acid."" Therefore, the compounds reacted together to form crystals.
"
ɗume ijjotowo naftirto be sipekturoskopi?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: raawandu yauɗi**.

The passage discusses the formation of crystals from melamine and cyanuric acid in animal urine, leading to kidney problems. FTIR spectroscopy is used to identify these crystals. This directly relates to the analysis of **diseased kidney (raawandu yauɗi)** tissue.
"
"""moye hokki luna “lamu maudun""""?""","The answer cannot be definitively determined from the passage provided. There's mention of people praising Luna and her accomplishments but not who gave her the ""big government"". Therefore, the closest possible answer based on the text is:

**A: panglire nde sollare** is the closest possible answer, but without further context, it is impossible to say.
"
"""moye latti luna """"fariki""""?""","Based on the text provided, the best answer is **D: mo koiɗol tomi**.

Here's why:

* **The text highlights the close relationship between Luna and Tomi.** Tomi says, ""Luna on debbo mo yiɗi waɗugo kuje ɗuɗɗum. Mo hakkilitta be kuɗe am"" which translates to ""Luna is a woman who likes to do many things. She's mindful of my affairs."" This shows a strong bond and suggests Tomi considered Luna a confidante.

The other options aren't as strongly supported by the provided text.
"

"
kare dume woni wola dou leddi fombina Afirika felle figirle mabbe?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: baude jogade Bol** (skill in handling the ball).

The passage specifically mentions ""bawde mabbe ha wawugo jogugo bal be daada ha hautugo hore"" which translates to ""their ability in handling the ball and passing precisely contributed..."" This highlights their skill in ball handling as a key strength.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: kude bodde** (good behavior) - While good behavior is important, it's not specifically mentioned as a reason for their success in the passage.

*   **C: jamminki bokki e anan fijirde** (unknown meaning) - This doesn't appear to be directly supported by the passage.

*   **D: baude tabbaki** (unknown meaning) - This is also not directly supported by the passage."
"iga habar don ndeye, ndeye fijirle afirica bedde yedo?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: njamdi 10:00 am**

The passage states: ""Fijirde man fuddi on jamdi sappo fajira..."" which translates to ""The game started at ten o'clock in the morning..."" or ""The game started at 10:00 am...""
"
iga habar don kalimawol ngole woni jodaki dou ekonomi china?,"The best answer is **C: china hakkilo hebai GDP dou united state** (China hakkilo heɓai GDP dou united state - China will likely surpass the US in GDP).

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Ceede Chaina heɓata diga duniya wawan ɓura je US ha duuɓi 20 warata ɗo"" which translates to ""China's revenue from the world will likely surpass the US in the next 20 years."" This directly relates to their potential GDP overtaking that of the US.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: ekonomi china nƴebti daga wo'ltinki Jaudum (economy china nƴebti daga wo'ltinki Jaudum - The Chinese economy benefited from world trade):** While true based on the information about international trade, this isn't the main focus of the passage's summary.
*   **B: china Don mari lumo mango ngo mota yarawo ha united state (china Don mari lumo mango ngo mota yarawo ha united state - China has a large motor vehicle market in the United States):** While the passage says China exports more cars than Germany and that they surpassed the US in the industry market, it doesn't explicitly state that China has a large car market in the United States.
*   **D: china yarato mota be Germany (china yarato mota be Germany - China sells cars to Germany):** The passage says China exports more cars than Germany, so it implies China exports to other countries but doesn't mention Germany as one.

**Therefore, option C is the most accurate summary of the economic information presented in the passage.**"
"iga habar, ndeye woni china GDP ɓuri united state?","The correct answer is **B: nder sappoji ɗiɗi**.

The passage states that China's GDP is expected to surpass that of the US in the next 20 years. ""Sappoji ɗiɗi"" translates to ""twenty"" in Fulfulde.
"
dume Hu wadi dou leddi ummuto'indi?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: ndakkilana dou ko ikonomi wurtinta**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions ""lari no njaudi Cayna warti"" (looking at how China's economy has changed), indicating a focus on economic performance.
*   It also discusses ""hu vi be 'habdan be musta hendu vodaka ha ko wani (unit)je GDP di dubi 2005 yahugo 2020'"" (evaluating the relative contribution of each unit to GDP from 2005 to 2020), which is related to economic output and growth.
*   The passage does not imply other options(A, C, D).

Therefore, option B is the most appropriate answer."
ko wani wa'ika daga Hu?,"Based on the provided text, the closest correct answer is **B: shawara dou wallide leddi dou bonnali**.

Here's why:

The text mentions that ""He advised them, however, to possess a fund that would enable them to invest in their work and abilities.""  This suggests an offering of assistance, potentially through a fund, to help them improve their economic situation. This aligns with providing assistance to countries dealing with economic challenges.

The other options are less relevant:

*   **A: ko hani dou tanƴal** - no information in the text suggests anything about reducing prices
*   **C: nyande carbon emisiton yida toyeki** & **D: baagol carbon emison tayeki**- The text does not mention carbon emissions, climate or environmental related topics.

Therefore, **B** is the most logical interpretation of Hu's advice based on the provided excerpt."

Richard Veerman is a spokesperson for Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders). So, he would be speaking on behalf of that organization.

"Ngam mabbuki, Huhne's moye todata znamaka njonde mako?","The passage states: ""Norman lamp MP do yida je be hosi ha business minister kugal davey do dilla.""  This translates to ""Norman Lamp MP wanted to be the business minister after Davey left.""

Therefore, Davey is the correct answer because the passage implies he left his position.

The correct answer is **A: Davi**
"
moye latinta kugal minista lumo rider bauɗinti nongol?,"The correct answer is **C: Davi**.

The passage states: ""Norman lamp MP do yida je be hosi ha business minister kugal davey do dilla"" which translates to ""Norman Lamp MP wanted the business minister job that Davey left."" This indicates that Davey previously held the position of business minister.
"

moye aran fodi surke tokki opera?,"The correct answer is **D: Camille Saint-Saëns**.

The passage clearly states that Camille Saint-Saëns composed the opera. Therefore, he is the one who ""aran fodi surke tokki opera"" (first did the work on the opera).
"
"""kowoni inde """"spacewalk"""" didaure nde le onou wadi?""","Based on the provided text, the answer is **B: sipes resa**

The passage states that Leonov was the ""kosmaunt no.11"" and was the first person to perform an EVA (extravehicular activity), often referred to as a ""spacewalk."" It also mentions he commanded a later mission involving a joint flight. The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project was the name of this mission.
"
leonov fodi iri soviet kugal dune?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**.

The text states that ""Duuɓi sappo ɓawo o ardi kuɗe himɓe yahata asama, yake man on holli dow ɓe arti komoi."" This translates to ""Ten years later, he led a human spaceflight, showing how to come together."" The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project was a joint US-Soviet mission, a symbol of cooperation in space. Therefore, it aligns with the description in the text.
"
moye nauni nden doeere?,"The correct answer is **D: direba mota manga (the truck driver)**.

The passage states: ""Laaƴowo waagon man, mo duɓi maako 64, naunai ha boofil mai"" which translates to ""The truck driver, who is 64 years old, was injured at the scene.""
"
dume hersi yimbe wombe nden doeere nden?,"Based on the provided text (even though it seems to have some typos or misspellings), the correct answer is **B: goto nauni, goto mayi** (one was injured, one died).

Here's why:

*   The text says ""Ɓe yaari Gibson asibiti amma o mayi wakkati seɗɗa be yottugo."" which means ""Gibson was taken to the hospital but he died shortly after arriving.""
*   It also states: ""Laaƴowo waagon man, mo duɓi maako 64, naunai ha boofil mai."" which means ""The wagon driver, who is 64 years old, was injured in the accident.""

Therefore, one person died (Gibson) and one person was injured (the wagon driver)."
sayintis don huwa do progiram o yidi o ndara o yetti dou?,"Based on the text, the scientists are studying the Sagittarius galaxy's tidal forces affecting the Milky Way. Therefore, the most relevant answer is:

**B: sembeji tidal (tidal forces)**

Here's why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: taskiram ƴodidum (accurate task):** While accuracy is important in any scientific endeavor, the text emphasizes the **effect** of the Sagittarius galaxy on the Milky Way.
*   **C: karon pamaron (small carbon):** The text doesn't specifically discuss the composition of the objects, such as carbon.
*   **D: kare balejum (black hole):** While black holes can be found in galaxies, the focus of the text is the larger interaction between the two galaxies through tidal forces."
sayintis don ndara kare dume ko lati?,"The correct answer is **D: sigatariyes, galaki be lawol bidaram**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions ""Sagittarius Galaxy"" (sagittarius galaksi).
*   It also discusses how the Milky Way is affected by the Sagittarius Galaxy (non on Milky Way dasata be sembe galaksi Sagittarius).
*   The passage refers to ""sagittariyos galaksi"" in the first line.
*  ""lawol bidaram"" refers to the ""Milky Way"" so the option is the most accurate representation of the elements mentioned."

Moye ijjitata kugal boiitinol goi hrricane Katrina dama rugal?,"The passage P is describing something related to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, where there were criticisms of how things were handled. The phrase ""Bush's New Orleans Deal"" is mentioned, and it involves contracts for reconstruction. The passage also mentions ""people giving contracts for things after the disaster on top of giving people in Washington.""

The question Q asks who benefited from the reconstruction efforts after Hurricane Katrina.

Analyzing the options:

*   **A: Fiskal dun gargajiya (Fiscal conservatism):** This is a principle or political ideology, not a group of people.

*   **B: Maunioki:** This doesn't seem relevant to the context.

*   **C: Ladde (Forest):** Irrelevant.

*   **D: Be nder Washington (People in Washington):** The passage P directly mentions people in Washington benefiting from the contracts and disaster relief efforts.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D**."
iga Habar toye hite daga Sitandus sipeskiraft yeite aran?,"The correct answer is **B: Woyla California**

The text states: ""Lusinan dou waila je coast je funa California bo laabinan asama daga California hedi Oregon je chaka bo hedi Nevada be Idaho be nder Utah,"" which translates to ""Stardust will launch on the northern coast of Southern California and will clear the skies from California to central Oregon and Nevada and Idaho and within Utah.""

This indicates that the initial launch point will be Northern California.
"
"Iga habar, sipeskiraft fudda foigo nden dine?","The correct answer is **D: Yadu iga San Francisco ha Angeles jalla**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Capsule man tokkai dillugo ha 12.8km kobo 8 miles ha hour, daga san francisco yahugo los angelos hosai minti gootel."" This directly translates to the trip from San Francisco to Los Angeles will be fast/quick.

Let's look at the other options:

*   A: The passage describes the spacecraft's features, but doesn't explicitly state that is difficult to build.
*   B: The passage describes the craft's movement and what it looks like, but doesn't explicitly state it is lightweight and easy.
*   C: While it mentions returning to Earth quickly, the primary point being made is the speed of the San Francisco to Los Angeles trip.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
Noye Dr Malar Balasubramanian hauta saroja Balasubramanian?,"Let's analyze the text to determine the relationship between Dr. Malar Balasubramanian and Saroja Balasubramanian.

The text states: ""Ha to, ɓe hefti ɓandu Saroja Balasubramanian, 53..."" meaning ""There, they found the body of Saroja Balasubramanian, 53...""

The text also says ""Dokotoro be inde Mala Balasubrameniyan be duuɓi 29..."" which means ""Doctor with the name Mala Balasubrameniyan with age 29...""

The question is ""Noye Dr Malar Balasubramanian hauta saroja Balasubramanian?"" meaning ""How is Dr Malar Balasubramanian related to Saroja Balasubramanian?""

Given that Saroja Balasubramanian is 53 years old and Dr. Malar Balasubramanian is 29 years old and that they share a last name, the most likely relationship is that Saroja is the mother of Dr. Malar.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

D: inna (mother)
"
tou dun hebi bandu sara balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **C: nden kine mota** (inside the car).

The passage states: ""be tawi Dada mai mayi ha yeso mota mako"" which translates to ""they found his mother dead in front of his car"". While she was actually *in* the car, the closest and most logically correct answer from the provided options is in front of the car.

*   ""Tarihi huilli (eBay`s) kam jun on manga ha hokkugo ilmu."" - This states that the historical event with eBay involves sharing knowledge.

The correct answer is **C: sikayif** (Skype), because the passage mentions eBay using Skype to connect with and learn from people in various regions."
kowoni eBay tofata be ekkitaki?,"Based on the context provided:

*   **P** describes eBay's historical expansion, focusing on entering manga markets and targeting countries like China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil through its established platform.
*   **Q** asks what makes eBay different in terms of teaching/learning.

None of the options (A, B, C, D) directly addresses the question of what makes eBay different regarding teaching/learning in relation to the context of its market expansion. The provided options seem unrelated to education or learning.

**Therefore, it is impossible to pick a correct answer with the options provided.** The options don't logically connect to the question based on the information available. It is possible that the context is incomplete, or there is an error in the questions or the provided options."
"iga habar, mowoni natidiral be yinbe luttube nde fellere haure?","Based on the passage provided:

This translates to: ""They faced financial sanctions and the restrictions the European Union placed on new oil exports, from which Iran's economy receives 80% of its foreign income."" This clearly indicates that the European Union restrictions on oil exports caused a significant economic impact. Although the other options are discussed in the passage, it is the European sanctions on oil exports that primarily directly affect the Iranian economy negatively.
"

The passage states that Allen is searching for Musashi because ""o yiɗi no hala habre duniya je fe’i"" which translates to ""he loves the history of the world war that has passed"". This implies his interest lies in the war itself.
"
"iga habar, noye haddin faddi?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: wartingo musashi**.

The passage explicitly states that Allen (who is very wealthy) is searching for the Musashi because he is interested in the history of World War II.
"
"iga habar, dume woni kowoda der ko limta?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: radioactive kasiyom** and **D: iodine**.

The passage explicitly mentions ""radioactive caesium be Iodine do hosi do gene"" (radioactive caesium and Iodine were released into the environment).
"
nder kolati dume woni na sefti kodum limti nder fellere?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: rakkilan iga yargo ndiyam famfo** (be careful when drinking tap water).

Here's why:

* **The passage warns about radioactive caesium and iodine being released.**  This directly relates to the safety of the water supply. The sentence ""be nyifa kuje pokkata hendu je nasara mabbe bo ta be yara dyam pampo"" which means ""they fear things spreading through the air, so they drink tap water carefully"" implies there is a specific concern about tap water due to the contamination.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: daccu naftirki fellere feunuki:** While there is a mention of a potential nuclear reaction, the text focuses more on the immediate consequences of the release of radioactive materials into the environment, especially the water.
* **B: dara nder:** This doesn't seem to directly relate to the information given. The passage implies leaving is safer.
* **C: daccu yarol churle daneje:** While relevant to the overall disaster, it's not the most direct and emphasized safety measure based on the passage. The drinking water contamination is more explicitly addressed.
"
"iga Dr. Moll, dume buti wannaki be XDR-TB?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: fere to sali magani**.

The passage states that XDR-TB is ""lekki ɗuɗai magugo,"" which translates to ""resistant to many drugs."" This means the bacteria are resistant to treatment with many medications.
"

This translates to: ""They use satellite technology which also uses radar technology to help people control planes and give information.""

Therefore, the answer is a combination of satellite and radar technology. Out of the choices given, the best answer is:

**A: setilait e-base tekinology** (satellite-based technology)
"
noye zaman yeso naftirta tirafik dun hendu rakkilanta nextGen?,"The correct answer is **C: carbon emishon ustaɗum**.

Here's why:

Therefore, the future application of NextGen air traffic control will likely involve decreased carbon emissions."
"iga habar, ko woni ijjataka dou FBI ko rkkiani e ko lati?","The correct answer is **A: ɓedduki nasaraku maɓɓe (Increasing their network)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""fu gam be beddi nasaraku pellel kugal majum."" This directly translates to ""in order to expand their network of work.""
*   The other options are either not mentioned or irrelevant to the main point of the passage.

Therefore, the passage focuses on the FBI's effort to increase its network, making option A the most accurate answer."

dume fedi be mota hite nga do'e jAS 39C gripen? ,"Based on the provided text, the JAS 39C Gripen **caught fire** (nangi hiite). Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **C: dum wuli** (it burned/it caught fire)"
tokkaki doeere JAS 39C gripen jipporde iyafot maɓɓama?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: mota hite**.

The text states: ""Baabal habaru je wuri yecci ha mota baabal sigal jirgi nangi be hiite ha talli de do dilla."" This translates to ""The news source reported that the engine of the fighter jet caught fire while taxiing.""
"

The passage states that Brzezinski helped Carter with global issues, including the Iranian Revolution.
"
moi jogi njode nashonal sikiwriti adibaisa yaki 1977?,"The correct answer is **A: Brzenzinski**.

The passage states: ""se bo o jogi korwal mohokkata saawara dau faddungo leddi (NSA) daga 1977 yahugo 1981"".  NSA stands for National Security Advisor. The passage clearly indicates Brzezinski held this position starting in 1977.
"
nden ko latti dume woni na non dou kuga bobek ɓe partizan belgrade?,"Based on the provided text, the most accurate answer is:

**C: o suɓama nde gotel o buri komoi ɓe bawal** (He was chosen as one of the best/greatest of Partizan players)

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Ha 1995 be supti mo buri wawugo fijirde ha be nane je himbe Partizan."" This translates to ""In 1995, he was chosen as the best player among the Partizan players.""

The other options are partially true but not the most direct answer to the question about Bobek's status with Partizan Belgrade:

*   **A: o nyami kollu 468 wakkati ofijanta sare** (He scored 468 goals in official matches): While the passage mentions he scored a total of 403 goals in 468 games for the club, it doesn't explicitly say he was chosen because of this
*   **B: o nyami kollo buri ko moye** (He scored more goals than anyone): The passage states ""wala mo fiji bo yari gols ɓuri Bobek"" Which translates to ""no one has scored more goals than Bobek"". While this is implied the passage doesn't explicitly say that he was selected because of his record breaking goal count.
*   **D: o wunti nder fijirle dou ko moye** (He played in more games than anyone): The passage does not mention that Bobek played in more games than anyone else. It only states he played in 468 games.
"
hala dume woni gonga dou habar bobek be partizan belgrade?,"The correct answer is **A: o fujji fijanki prtizan ha 1945**

Here's why:

*   The passage clearly states: ""O fuddi kogal be mabbe ha dubi 1945 har yahugo 1958"" (He started playing with them in 1945 until 1958). This confirms he began playing for Partizan in 1945.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: o fijjani zagreb ɓuri fijirde partizan belgrade:** The passage states he was born in Zagreb, Croatia, but spent most of his playing career for Partizan Belgrade.
*   **C: o fijjani partizan ha 1995:** The passage says he was chosen as the best player in 1995, not that he played for Partizan in that year.
*   **D: O he hebi mangu gaɗa o suɓama burɗo bowul fijirde partizan:** He was chosen as the best player after he had already achieved greatness in the club. The choice of him being the best player by Partizan only solidified his greatness."
"Iga habar, kala hude dume henɗi hesperonychus be Velociraptor?","Based on the provided text (P), the correct answer is:

**A: don mari koiɗe ɗiɗo**

The text specifically states that Hesperonychus moved on two legs, implying it had two feet (koiɗe ɗiɗo). The other options are not directly supported by the text.
"
"""kowoni """"hesperonychus"""" heɓama iga fiskal karaktaristik speshis?""","The correct answer is **C: koiɗe**

Here's why:

The passage states that ""pedeli didabre majum buri maunugo, kanjum wadi be wanniga inde Hesperonychus dum nufata “western claw”"".  This translates to ""Its two feet are bigger, which is why the name Hesperonychus means 'western claw'"". Thus, the name ""hesperonychus"" comes from a physical characteristic related to its **claws** (koiɗe).
"
nder hala dou dume woni hala fidal ganga?,"The correct answer is **D: fidale ngadama nder buffalo** (a shooting happened in Buffalo).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Gorko mo do bangi duubi mako 30, be danyi mo ha Buffalo, o do der himbe nai je be fidi amma debbo mako wala ko hebi mo."" This translates to ""A man, about 30 years old, born in Buffalo, was among four people who were shot, but his wife was unharmed."" This clearly indicates a shooting incident occurred in Buffalo.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: degorko be ɗeɓɓo fu iga Texas** (Both the man and woman are from Texas) - The passage mentions they relocated from Texas to Buffalo. Only the man was born in Buffalo.
*   **B: waɗiɓe bambe njoyo** (Five people were bombed) - The passage mentions four people were shot (""be fidi""), not bombed.
*   **C: ɓangabe ɓangi nɗungu kosali nder buffalo** (The passengers traveled safely in Buffalo) - The passage indicates there was a shooting, not a safe trip."
hala dume won ganga dou kolati ha fellere fidal?,"Based on the provided text (P), the most accurate answer is:

*   **A: dun fe'aake wakkat buffalo biki**

The passage states that the group moved from Texas to Buffalo to reunite with friends and family, and that a 30-year-old man, born in Buffalo, was among the four people shot. This implies that the shooting happened in Buffalo."
"iga habar, ko dun rakkilani aran dou ardibe luno?","Based on the information provided in the prompt (P), the correct answer is **A: rellere taki cargo**.

The last sentence of paragraph P states: ""Jirgi ndiya je juti be mita temerre ɗo lawol hosugo taaki sai hakkilinaaɓe huli dau wawan sakkina kare."" This translates to: ""Large ships with a length of a hundred meters transporting cargo must be carefully navigated to ensure safe unloading.""
"
"Iga habar, hala dume woni nanon nder hala luno?","Based on the provided text (which seems to be in Fulfulde), the most accurate answer is:

*   **B: jirgi ndiyam dou mari mita 100 be jamnirdum wakkati duooki**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Jirgi ndiya je juti be mita temerre ɗo lawol hosugo taaki sai hakkilinaaɓe huli dau wawan sakkina kare"" which translates to something like: ""Ships of 100 meters long must be careful when docking and unloading cargo.""

The other options are not directly supported by the text provided."

"
toye telebijin wadaka wakkati uki mo?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: nden Rome fu** (then all of Rome).

The passage states ""Rome wati television ha babe duddum heba himbe wuro lara ukkannoji,"" which translates to ""Rome put televisions in many places so that the people of the city could watch."" This means the television broadcast was centered in Rome itself.
"
toye dun wadu buk uki?,"Based on the provided text, the most accurate answer is:

*   **D: aran nder Rome, sakiti nder italian**

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states that the event took place in Rome and that television was set up so people from all over, including Italy and Poland, could watch. It mentions the event was broadcast widely across Italy and other parts of the world.
* The text mentions Poland because of its large population that watched the event.

Therefore, while Poland was very engaged, the event originated in Rome and spread to Italy."
"tokkaki bantaki, moye magani nauni be?","The correct answer is **B: wala ko moye** (nobody).

The passage states ""Wala naunande manga je be yecci"" which translates to ""There was no major injury reported"". Therefore, nobody was significantly injured.
"

*   Nicholas Alden (25)
*   Zachary Cuddeback (21)
*   Edgar Veguilla
*   Kristoffer Schneider

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: 4**
"
figirlar moi salifidol wakkati konnuyel?,"Based on the provided text, the person who is described as being ""la’nyo'yo mota mai"" is Zachary Cuddeback. Since the question ""figirlar moi salifidol wakkati konnuyel?"" seems to be asking who was injured, and ""la’nyo'yo mota mai"" likely means injured, the answer is:

**A: cuddeback**
"

*   Rugby and Golf were selected to be added to the Olympics.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Rogby**"

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Rogby union**.
"

The passage states that ""Bawo duubi 250, Guinness mauni warti ko waddata choggu je buri euros biliyon 10..."" meaning that after 250 years, Guinness was generating over 10 billion euros.
"
Guiness dpn waɗɗa billion dollars noye idungu?,"The correct answer is **D: 10**

The passage states that Guinness makes over 10 billion euros annually. While the US dollar equivalent is also given, the question asks about the euro value.
"
nde lesde noye European union ma H5N1 Virus heptadum?,"Based on the passage, the answer is **C: joi be ɗiɗi** (six plus two = eight).

The passage states:

*   ""Leddi Frans on je je ɗiɗi je nyau man nasti ha nder kawrital leddi wani ha Urop, ɓawo Ostriya, Jamani, Sloveniya, Bolgeriya, Gris be Itali.""

This translates to:

*   ""France is the second country where the disease entered within the European Union, after Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece and Italy.""

Counting the countries listed after France: Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy. That makes **6**, then adding **France and Austria = 8 Countries**."
Tou dun hebi nyau H5N1 virus e borna?,"The correct answer is **A: Faransa (France)**.

The passage states: ""Leddi Frans on je je ɗiɗi je nyau man nasti ha nder kawrital leddi wani ha Urop..."". This translates to ""France is the second country where the disease entered into the coalition of countries that is in Europe..."". So France is one of the countries where H5N1 was found.
"
Ndeye hatis hauti nyau bako nasta jama'are iga be njode jam?,"The correct answer is **B: shim ko askara'en njotto**

The passage states: ""Bako soja en man wara, Haiti hebai masibo je do hauti be nyawu man tun duubiji 1800 en."" This translates to ""Before the soldiers came, Haiti hadn't had an epidemic related to the disease since the 1800s.""

Therefore, Haiti had not experienced such a cholera outbreak until the arrival of the soldiers.
"
iga felle nyudduɗum woni dou wakita nyau?,"The correct answer is **A: mayo Artibonite**.

Here's why:

The passage states that bacteria from a UN source contaminated a water source connected to the Artibonite River, leading to the cholera outbreak. Therefore, the Artibonite River is a crucial factor in understanding the origin and spread of the disease.
"
dume lamu Irish yiɗi wadugo?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: wadduki doka naftirgo magani**.

The passage discusses the Irish government's intention to address concerns regarding parliamentary legislation and drug-related issues. The Minister of Justice is worried about people exploiting legal loopholes related to drug use. This implies that the government wants to introduce legislation (doka) to regulate and address drug use (naftirgo magani).
"
dume woni boddum wakkati jun ireland?,"Based on the passage and the question ""What is a good time for Ireland?"", the provided options (Bulgaria, Greece, Cuba, Medicine) don't seem to have any relevance.  The passage discusses Parliamentary legislation and legal concerns within Ireland, but doesn't offer any clues about tourism or seasons that would help determine the best time to visit.

Therefore, it's impossible to answer this question with the information given. All options provided are incorrect.
"
kodum ndarata be naftirow o mag?,"Based on the context, the correct answer is **B: bonnali bandu (murder/homicide)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes a situation involving a death, investigation, and covering up of evidence. This strongly suggests a crime has been committed.
*   The phrase ""wada binchike ha dou gorko be tumah be laifi je hanea be vonnu go kujeji"" roughly translates to doing something violent to someone that is wrong

Therefore, the action being asked about most likely refers to murder."
wakkal wattitol alamakuji ko mowadata?,"Based on the prompt in what seems to be Hausa and the options, the correct answer is likely **B: boiitina be alamaku njode jam** which translates to ""uncover the clues related to the crime scene"".

Here's why:

*   The initial text describes a crime scene in Los Angeles, where someone has committed a serious offense.
*   It mentions that the body is wrapped in black tarps, obscuring evidence.
*   The question asks about the meaning of ""wattitol alamakuji ko mowadata?"" Which is translated to, "" what is the meaning of the clues?""

Option B directly addresses the need to uncover the clues at the scene, making it the most relevant and appropriate choice."
"iga habar, moye jangirta turankore mo karno jamaji?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: yabuki dokaji**.

The passage mentions that someone accused Karno of copyright infringement but he defended himself by saying he ""o ɗonno wola iri fere bo o ɗo ekkitina himɓe no ɓe heɓata mo ɓe yiɗi bo o ɗonno bana sobajo himɓe makaranta man'."" This translates roughly to ""...he was a different kind of [teacher] and he taught people how to get what they want, and he was like a friend to the students.""

This implies that Karno had a different approach to teaching, perhaps one that was not traditional or conventional. The claim suggests that he facilitated students' desires, implying a certain level of ""manipulation"" or unconventional methods.

The other options don't directly align with the information in the passage.
"
"iga habar, moye woni hosaka be Rolando Mendoza?","The correct answer is **D: mo hoshol foto** (tourists/photo takers).

The passage states that Rolando Mendoza hijacked a bus full of tourists, and they were photo-takers from Hong Kong.
"
"iga habar, ɓene woni yafaka jauɗum?","Based on the passage, the most accurate answer is:

**C: nder hoshol foto**

The passage states: ""himbe hosata hoto je wari diga Filipins."" which translates to ""the tourists who came from Hong Kong"". Since they were tourists, it's likely they were there on vacation and therefore the most plausible answer is ""tourist""."
"iga habar, moye mari hokke ju mangal jinsi gotel?","D: Marta Suplicy
"
moye ɓe njabai rokki bindi?,"The correct answer is **B: Roberto Jefferson**.

The passage states that the legislation, after being voted on, would be in the hands of Roberto Jefferson (""Legislation je be watta, bawo vountungo, do jungo Roberto Jefferson"").
"
"iga habar, Armand Versace dume wada moggan jama'are Fonti wakkatiyel?","Based on the passage, the most accurate answer is:

**C: dum mari hendu sembindu** (It had a strong wind)

The passage describes the wind starting to blow and quickly reaching 20 kilometers per hour.
"
"iga Versace, ndeye hendu sembindu fuddi?","The correct answer is **A: mintiji sedda dou dun fuddi yiki**.

The passage states: ""minti jowi nder hollugo se hendu fuddi bokkugo"" which translates to ""five minutes before it started to blow"". This implies that the wind started blowing a few minutes ago. Option A, ""mintiji sedda dou dun fuddi yiki"" translates to ""a few minutes ago it started"".
"
"burnora Fred, norgewol hoshana dou 35°W?","The answer is **B: Tati**.

The passage states: ""hendu man on hendu masibo je tatabre je ɓuri sembe sosai ha koɓe meɗi larugo ha gefe lettugal je 35oW"" which translates to: ""...the storm was the third strongest ever observed east of 35°W.""
"
wakkati Fred woni Cape Verde island toye o fati?,"The text says Fred is moving ""be gefe hiirnaange danneere Kep Verd"" which translates to ""towards the west direction of Cape Verde"". So the correct answer is **A: hirna (west)**.

**A: ko ɓuri yawugo dogguduji** (Higher running speed)

The passage states that 802.11n runs faster than its predecessors.
"
Moftorɗe guda noi woni ha olympic kangere daanɗe jabugo lekki ngam naweaweji mako?,"Based on the provided text, I cannot determine the correct answer. The passage is in a language I don't understand, and the question is also in a different language. I need a translation of both the passage and the question into English to understand the context and provide an accurate answer.
"
Kowaɗi noi olympic heɓuɓe kangere ja'ande jabougo lekki ngam newanaji mako?,"Based on the content and the context of the questions, none of the options provided seem to be a direct answer to the question. The passages describe activities related to sports and the preparation of a playing field, it can be inferred that the person involved is responsible for creating the setting or stage for the games. Therefore, the correct answer should be related to the preparation of the environment for the game.

Therefore, the closest and the most appropriate option is:

**D: Dun jabaka je fijirle jaudi (It's part of the game preparations)**
"
"Iga habar, dume hublata dou kuje ɗinbaki leddi?","The correct answer is **B: Humtinare iga felle icelandic meteorological**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Babal kugal Icelandic Meteorological vi walla dimbugo leddi ha babal hekla ha awa ji 48 je sali."" This directly translates to something like ""The Icelandic Meteorological Office reported an earthquake near Hekla volcano 48 hours ago."" This means the information came directly from the Icelandic Meteorological Office.
* Options A, C, and D are not directly mentioned in the passage."
Iga habar ndeye fes wattitaki wadi?,"The correct answer is **B: Nder wakkati 48 sa'aji**

The passage states ""Babal kugal Icelandic Meteorological vi walla dimbugo leddi ha babal hekla ha awa ji 48 je sali,"" which translates to ""The Icelandic Meteorological Office predicts an eruption in the Hekla area within the next 48 hours.""
"
Nder halaaji dou chandrayaan-1 lunar pprobe woni ngoga?,"Based on the provided information, the correct answer is **D: Probe don mari fenti be wattudu.**

The passage states that after taking three scientific payloads, the lunar probe carried a picture of the Indian flag, making a dent where it landed. This directly implies that the probe had an impact.
"
Halawol ngole hinditi dou lunar probe?,"The correct answer is **A: Dun jippake woylawol lauro**.

Here's why:

*   The original text in Fulfulde discusses Chandrayaan-1 deploying the Moon Impact Probe (MIP) which intentionally crashed on the moon.
*   Option A describes a crash landing.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   Option B talks about a return mission which wasn't the main aspect of the given text.
*   Option C is unrelated to the text (about getting information from orbit.)
*   Option D is unrelated to the text (about having two orbital tools.)"
"Iga habar, ngole dun hoita dou hadugo nƴau shkinƴol?","The correct answer is **B: Nangobe Alaɗoje (Catching Pigs)**.

The passage states that due to the spread of the disease, the Indian government is taking steps to capture pigs in the most affected areas. This directly addresses how they are trying to control the spread of the disease.
"
Noye shiya njamuji nangirta yimɓe?,"The correct answer is **C: Aladeji** (Pigs).

The passage states that the disease comes from pigs and can spread to humans if they consume it. Therefore, pigs are the source of the disease that infects people."
Daoore halawol ɗiɗaboi ngol wadai dume?,"The correct answer is **D: Haɗuki kauta ko'e jinsi gotel**.

The passage states: ""Sende hebugo hala didabre man, je yidi be hada gorko be gorko banga, wawan mabbita dammugal ni gorko be gorko banga ha yeso.""  This translates to something like: ""The aim of the second proposal, which wants to prohibit men from marrying men, may open the door for men marrying men in the future.""  Therefore, the second proposal is about prohibiting same-sex marriage.
"
"Iga habar, ndeye kalimawol ɗiɗaboi wagga?","The correct answer is **B: nder 2011**.

The passage states that Wowuntingo has introduced a bill that has failed twice since 2011.
"
"""Moye """"Panama papers"""" Wurti?""","The correct answer is **A: Firm Mossack Fonseca**.

The passage clearly states that the ""Defteji Panama"" (Panama Papers) originated from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.
"
"Iga habar moye wadi Britih pires jogade, rakkiloni kuwanoji kamfanoji jaudi?","The correct answer is **C: Banki Deutshe**

The passage states that ""British deftere The Guardian habaru je moh hakkilinta vi'i ha do Deutsche Bank do hakkilla ha kiyasi tati nder kamfani huwatako 1200 be naftiri ɓe huɓi haaje maɓɓe."" This directly mentions The Guardian (a British newspaper) focusing on Deutsche Bank's role.
"
Nder lattidi ngole mari bonnigo mangol be doeere jirgin sama?,"The correct answer is **C: Jirgi doii do lowal Armenia ha Iran**.

The text mentions a ""hatsari nyaɗɗum ha lawol Pireewol ɗum larai ha duɓiji yake o dillata Armenia do'e,"" which translates to ""a terrible accident on the road that goes for many years to Armenia."" This clearly indicates a crash on the road to Armenia within Iran.
"
Ngole won nanon nder ko lattinta dudirka doee jirgi inder Iran?,"The best answer based on the information provided is **C: Shudime hadi sodol jirgi kesum (Difficulty in buying new planes)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions that foreign sanctions prevent Iran from replacing or purchasing new aircraft. This directly contributes to the aging fleet and increased risk of accidents.

Let's look at the other options:

*   A: Ummaki jirgi be nane je askar be ƴinbe (Plane maintenance and training issues): While not explicitly stated, it's a plausible contributing factor if the sanctions make it difficult to obtain parts and proper training. However, it's not the *most* direct reason provided in the text.
*   B: Shiya bajet hadi sodol jirgi (Lack of budget for buying planes): This is likely related to the sanctions that are highlighted, if they can't buy new planes from the sanctions, this will mean there is a lack of budget to buy new planes. This answer is second best as the other answer focuses on the most direct root cause.
*   D: Shiya rakkilanki yadu jirgi (Lack of interest in plane travel): This is highly unlikely and not supported by the passage. People likely still need to travel by plane.

Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer because it reflects the explicit information given about sanctions preventing Iran from upgrading its fleet."
Dume wodi wadaka nde hundetirki iga ngangoɓe ha Iraq?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: Tabbitingo chnji, ummingo kaɓe nder Iraq daccai**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions the situation in Iraq at 12:00 GMT and discusses the potential for internal conflict, increased instability, and further problems.
*   The passage then describes the importance of this news in relation to policies about Iraq and changing their systems and laws.
*   A major part of the news is about quickly passing a new law (Law 78) that focuses on addressing the issues.
*   The text implies that changes are expected to happen in Iraq.
*   The passage mentions the potential for internal conflict."
Dume woni wiaka iga jande huntinre Iraq?,"Based on the provided passage, the correct answer is **D: Wadol kautal hore faki yeso kesum.**

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions a new law being considered in Iraq. This law is described as a way to allow people to claim compensation for losses suffered due to past conflicts. This aligns with the idea of ""Wadol kautal hore faki yeso kesum"" (Making new arrangements for people who want to settle their debts).
*   The other options are less directly supported by the text:
    *   Option A - ""Ɗo wi tobbitinki danol kaɓeji"" (saying that it is necessary to pay debts) is not mentioned in the passage.
    *   Option B - ""Gifol wattutuki lowal"" (a debt payment that will be lowered) is not mentioned in the passage.
    *   Option C - ""Ɓe naftingo yamfantirde"" (a debt that is in excess) is not mentioned in the passage."
Iga askar en moye woni gerdinaɗo of rovenzano?,"Based on the passage provided, the correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

The passage states, ""Himbe tabbitan fulaku vi lo piccolo do mari jungo je do gam o arti o wadi provenzano’s goddo jungo nyamo ha Palermo..."" This indicates that Lo Piccolo was Provenzano's right-hand man in Palermo.
"
"Iga habar heɓadun , dume wadi sanadi maigo falcones?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is:

**A: Be varimo wakkati konu Riina-driven**

The passage mentions that Provenzano became the leader after Riina's arrest, and that Riina had initiated a war (konu) against the state after the deaths of Falcone and Borsellino. This implies that Falcone's death happened during a time when Riina was escalating conflict, hence ""Riina-driven konu.""
"
"Dume nden, ho lati noɗun go'o nder Maunirgo Hitoshi saito?","The correct answer is **C: Wakkatiti ɗiɗi Olympic gold medalist**.

The passage clearly states that Hitoshi Saito won two Olympic gold medals (""nyamido galaba je didi Olympic"").
"
Taye iwasaki wowi haugo sherge?,"The passage says that Iwasaki was caught in India. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: India**
"
Moi tebbi iwasaki?,"Based on the information provided in P, none of the options A, B, C, or D directly answer the question of who killed Iwasaki. The passage describes Iwasaki's difficult journey and the troubles he faced, but it does not mention his death or who might have been responsible.

Therefore, none of the provided answers are correct based on the given context.
"
Ndeye Alonso timmini teure mun?,"Based on the passage:

*   The passage states: ""Michael Schumacher timmini fijirde doggugo mota jutinga bawo Alonso"". This translates to: ""Michael Schumacher finished the race following Alonso.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: Gaɗanta Shumacher timmini teure mun** (Meaning: Schumacher finished the race.)
"
Koyaɗe Shumacher tommini teure be lan?,"The correct answer is **D: Wonnago mota joiininga**.

The passage states that Michael Schumacher finished the race ""doggugo mota jutinga bawo Alonso,"" which translates to ""finishing the race following Alonso.""  The key phrase is ""mota jutinga,"" which means ""trailing car"" or ""a car that is trailing/following."" This implies a car that is trailing.
"
"Iga habar, dun kugal moye hokkula beli nangaɓe?","The correct answer is **D: Mo bial kotu**.

The passage discusses a judge (alkali) and a court (kotu), and mentions that the judge made a ruling regarding the treatment of those arrested. Therefore, the court system is the institution providing the service to those arrested.
"
Iga dakowol biangol enta habar ɗume nangabe marata ngoje ha sa'aje 24?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: Nƴamtere iga kito Glynn**

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses Judge Glynn's order.** The first paragraph details that Judge Glynn issued an order preventing the agency from paying individuals who were arrested for over 80 specified offenses without a 24-hour waiting period and the opportunity for a hearing.

Therefore, the question about what happens within 24 hours directly relates to Judge Glynn's actions.

"Dou ko ndarani ndartidi, dalla keyeya naftiraka ha labbinki ko faddu fijo?","Based on the provided context, the best answer is **B: Soide famkinki do ko larani titi-tedi fijo majun**.

Here's why:

*   **The main points of P are:**
    *   Financial issues in Afghanistan.
    *   The need for transparency and accountability in elections.
    *   Concerns about the electoral process and influence over Afghanistan's resources.

*   **Answer B directly relates to these points:** Understanding the specifics of the electoral process and resources at stake is essential for transparency, accountability, and mitigating the risks.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Soide njodde jam**: While peace is a general goal, it's not the direct focus of the passage.

*   **C: Chaddum masiny**: This doesn't seem to align to the context

*   **D: Vangungo kitaji hade titi-tedi fijirle**: This doesnt align to the context.

Therefore, understanding the details of the electoral game and its consequences is the most relevant choice in this instance."
Ko wonta dalla faddaki fijirle majun yidinaka ha Ardinabe?,"Based on the passage, the main issue is about:

*   **Afghan'en be barugo ceede be reenugo risku je zaɓe feere.** (Afghans fighting for money and protecting election risk, or more generally, Afghans dealing with financial and election-related difficulties).
*   **Jagordo lesde en vi be habar mai ha dou (Afghan) dokoki mabbe gam be acce babal mai wala nafu.** (Leaders talking about Afghan laws so they can abandon it or benefit.)
*   **fasutuggo suɓtugo man handai ha no be watta kujeji ha leddi.** (election corruption or electoral flaws influence things to happen in the country.)

Now consider the answer choices:

*   **A: Di dullani titi-tedi majun** (Their names have been mentioned.) - This doesn't relate to the problems mentioned in the passage.

*   **B: Wodi ko larani soiɗe njonɗe jam** (Something that concerns the safety of lives.) - It aligns closely with the situation described in the passage, particularly the risks and difficulties faced by Afghans and the potential for instability or violence.

*   **C: Wodi ko yiɗinaka hader titi-tedi majun** (something that has been desired for their names) - This is not very relevant to the Afghan election.

*   **D: Ko larani chuɓi nawi masitin** (It concerns elections that are difficult.) - This refers to a difficult election but not the concern that comes with it.

**Therefore, the most accurate answer is B: Wodi ko larani soiɗe njonɗe jam**"
Ɓeyen taskitini ko larani nokkuje kita ha FATA?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **B: Jogitirɓe siyasaji (Pakistani political agents)**.

The passage states that after Pakistan's independence in 1947, Pakistani political agents were appointed to administer the FATA region. They had significant power and autonomy, essentially dictating policy.
"
"""Toije-wonta ngondinaka nder tokkidirɗi hado """"Jogitirɓe siyasaji"""" ha FATA's?""","Based on the provided information (P), the correct answer is **B: Ɓen-ɓe ardiɗo lesdi Pakistan subti (Those who are selected by the President of Pakistan)**.

Here's why:

*   Paragraph P states that after Pakistan's independence from British rule in 1947, the Pakistani government appointed political agents to administer the FATA region. This implies that these agents were chosen or appointed by the central government, specifically the leader of Pakistan."
Dou manore ndeye Emma Stone Chuɓama?,"The answer is **A: Fijowo Ɓurɗo yiɗego**.

The passage states: ""Goslin be Ston heɓi nasti zaaɓe je himɓe fim wawi, Goslin ɗo je worɓe, Ston ɗo je rewɓe.""

This translates to: ""Gosling and Stone were nominated in the categories for best film actors, Gosling in the male category, Stone in the female category.""  Therefore, Emma Stone was nominated for Best Actress. The best translation of that into the choices provided is Fijowo Ɓurɗo yiɗego.
"
Manore ndeyere wonta chuɓaka nder movie-rende-e?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: Gimol burngol asali**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that Gosling and Stone were nominated for acting awards (male and female categories respectively).
*   It also states that other nominations were for categories like best picture, screenplay, directing, score, and song for movies.
*   The passage specifically highlights that ""two songs from the movie, score and original song, were also nominated.""

Therefore, ""gimol burngol asali"" (original song) is a category explicitly mentioned as a nomination."
Ɗiyeji luttano nder kuweteɗi bawo dimbago lesdi?,"Based on the passage, the answer is **B: Haa babal jippago firowal nder Ishikawa**.

The passage states: ""Laabiji man vonnii, kudeeji jirgi leddii ma dow sarkanii ha be maɓɓi pelell piiroowol Noto ha wuro Ishikawa."" This translates to ""The roads were destroyed, and the railroad tracks were affected up to the Noto airport in Ishikawa.""  This indicates damage to the airfield.
"
"Dou ko ndarani ndartiɗi, ɗiyeji on wani vounaki ɓawo dimbago lesdi?","The correct answer is **C: Labi goɗɗi**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Laabiji man vonnii"" which translates to ""Their labs were damaged"". This aligns directly with option C.

The other options are not as directly supported by the text:

*   **A: Sareji goɗɗe (Other Companies):** While NHK is mentioned, the focus is on Hokuriku Electric Power Company and the damage to its facilities.
*   **B: Kautateɗi ɗiɗi gonɗi haaSshika plant (Two Companies at the Ashika Plant):** The text mentions Kashiwazaki-Kariwa in Niigata, not Ashika. The emphasis isn't on companies collaborating, but damage to infrastructure.
*   **D: Badal jippago Firolgal Noto (Noto Airport Change):** The passage mentions damage to landing facilities at Noto Airport but does not indicate it has been replaced."
"Dou ko ndarani ndartidi, toi wonta matsala ka nasdinaka nder defte?","The correct answer is **A: Ko larani yahungo yeso Jerusalam** (What will happen to Jerusalem in the future).

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses the future status of Jerusalem. It highlights that both sides (Israelis and Palestinians) have historical and religious claims to the city.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   B: talks about the 1967 war, which is background information but not the central question.
*   C: refers to soldiers, which is relevant but not the main focus.
*   D: is related to borders, but the passage is more concerned with the future of Jerusalem.

So, the question asked in Q most closely relates to option A, which asks about the future of Jerusalem."
Nder ko sakiti ngole wonta Palestine's marai haje?,"Based on the information provided in the text, the correct answer is:

**D: Sojaen ɓe lattini duɓi joi nder Jordan Valley**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""PA sali o wi'i sayni to ɓe yerdi je duɓɓi 5."" which directly translates to ""PA refused to sign unless they agreed to 5 years."" This implies PA is asking for 5 years in Jordan Valley.
"
Nder lesdi ndiye Ma jangi jargirde kita?,"Based on the passage, the answer is **A: Haa United States of America**.

The passage states ""O jaangi ha Jaami’a New York be nanta alkaliku ha jaangirde Havard,"" which translates to ""He studied at the University of New York and later earned a degree at Harvard University."" Both of these universities are in the United States.
"
"Dou ndarani ndartidi, lesdi ndiyeri mari hakke dou nyamugo chuɓi Ma?","Based on the provided text, the question asks which country is associated with the statement that Ma is working to draw closer to China.

The text explicitly mentions:

*   **P:** ""...Ma nyami be sauki be kungiya tefata ɓe ɓaditina alaka be lesdi Cayna."" (Ma seems to be working with groups to draw closer to the country of China.)

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: Haa China**
"
"Dou ko limta nder ndartidi, beyen latti Carolyn Wilson huwanta bako o-accha wuro?","The correct answer is **C: OHA man**.

The passage states: ""bur’na layuol doddon hafti Carolyn Wilsonje OHA wujji..."" which translates to ""a respected member of the community named Carolyn Wilson from OHA stole..."" This clearly indicates that Carolyn Wilson worked for OHA.
"
"Nder fijirle nai lutti haa nder hitande, moijo-in latti nayabo haa nder Bawuɓe Lanyuku?","The correct answer is **A: Hamlin**.

The passage states ""Ha je tati, Hamlin do bawo be nogas, amma o sali Bowyer be joyi..."" which translates to ""In third, Hamlin is behind by twenty, but he is ahead of Bowyer by five..."" This indicates Hamlin is in third place in the standings. The question asks for the person who is fourth in the championship standings for the last four races. Given Hamlin is third and ahead of Bowyer, Bowyer must be in fourth place. However, Bowyer is not the answer option. The question is asking for the fourth person in the Champion series.

*   Keselowski: 1st
*   Johnson: 2nd
*   Hamlin: 3rd
*   Bowyer: 4th
*   Kahne: 5th
*   Truex, Jr: 6th

Bowyer is 4th, so Hamlin must be in third place. Given the option of Hamlin, this must be the correct answer.
"
"Ko sakita bawo fijirle limtadi nder ndartidi, points no-on khane mari nder Driver's Championship?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The text states that Kahne is in fifth place with 2,220 points.
"
"Bano ndartidi-majun vangini, ndenoi jamaare shaidi yanuki tedeorite nje warti tabbitini usuli martian?","The text states: ""guda chappan’e tati ‘e nay 34 tan be wawi be larti do asali martian on."" This translates to ""only thirty-four (34) of them were traced to a Martian origin.""  However, the text goes on to say that ""Tapaji sappo e jowey ɗon nder iri je do’i ha iyende mitiorit je lewru Banjaaru sakitindu je saali"", which translates to ""Fifteen of them are from a specific type of meteorite that comes from the moon"". This makes the question confusing because both numbers are present in the excerpt. 

Based solely on the **first** piece of information regarding the number of meteorites from Mars, the correct answer is **D: Nde talatin-e-naiy (Thirty-four)**."
"Bana no limta nder ndartidi, dume wonta gonga haa dou koseije keptadi boo latti nder usuli Martian?","The correct answer is **D: Di latti kanji 34 on**.

The passage states that out of the approximately 24,000 meteorites found on Earth, only 34 are confirmed to be of Martian origin. The other options are incorrect based on the information provided in the passage.
"

The passage states that Schumacher considered returning in 2009 to replace the injured Felipe Massa.
"
Wakkatire ndei'on Massa heɓi nau-nande?,"The correct answer is **A: Wakkati Grand Prix**.

The passage states that Massa was injured at the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.
"
"Ko ndarani ndartidi, haa noi'on taskaram majuun bonnirta AOL?","Based on the provided information, the most logical answer is:

**B: AOL lattin kamfaniwa sorrowa jeiy nyaminta luumo IM yesso**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that AOL used to be a dominant IM platform in the US.
*   The passage also states that the combined user base of Yahoo and Microsoft is comparable to AOL's. This suggests that AOL is no longer the dominant force it once was.
*   Option B directly implies that AOL's market share in the IM market is declining, which fits the context of the passage.

The other options are less likely:

*   **A:** While a desire for improved features could contribute to user migration away from AOL, it's not a direct indication of AOL's decline in market share.
*   **C:** This implies user dissatisfaction due to lack of interoperability, which isn't the main focus of the passage. The primary concern is AOL's declining market share.
*   **D:** The passage states that AOL was widely used in the US. Even if the number of users decreases, it doesn't suggest that AOL is not used in the United States anymore.

Therefore, **Option B** is the best answer as it directly addresses the implication that AOL's position in the IM market is weakening."
Ngole nder ɗiɗo waddata ragare tokkitinki taskaram kesiɗi?,"Based on the provided information, the most logical answer is **B: Nafturgo luumo IM (Naftorgo luumo Internet Message)**

Here's why:

*   **The passage focuses on AOL's IM service and its popularity in the US.** The main point is about AOL's efforts to make its IM platform attractive to a large user base, including making it easier for people to do what they want.
*   **Other options are less relevant:**
    *   **A: Ko nyaminta Widespread Internet haa nder lesdi United States (Widespread Internet Usage in the United States):** This is a general topic, but the passage focuses on the specifics of AOL's IM platform.
    *   **C: Heɓango AOL fesaare gam tabbitingo luumo ga hore maaga (AOL's strategy to secure its market position):** While AOL might have a strategy, the passage does not talk about any of AOL's strategy.
    *   **D: Kautal houre yahoo be nanta Microsoft's (The alliance between Yahoo and Microsoft):** The passage mentions Yahoo and Microsoft only in comparison to AOL's user numbers. The passage doesn't say if Yahoo and Microsoft have come together.

**In summary, the passage is about the usage and accessibility of AOL's IM platform; therefore, the answer is B.**"
Himbenoi nbaraama nder lattube naa yansanda?,"The text states that two police officers (polici en guda ɗiɗi) were killed. Therefore, the answer is:

**B: 2**
"
Moi nasdini wulladu dou fe'aano majuun?,"The correct answer is **A: Yansanda**.

The passage states: ""Ha office jagordo mai vi himbe 19 je nauni mai patt police on Yansanda'en vi ɓe ɗo tuhma Deash (ISIL)"". This translates to: ""From the governor's office, it was said that 19 people who were injured by the police, the Yansanda are accusing Daesh (ISIL)"". Thus Yansanda accused Deash (ISIL)
"
"Dalla matsayi Florida, latti ardido hoi lesde majuum fuu, sha'hu nguye ɓe wanni Mitt Romney?","The correct answer is **C: Wakili'en jihajiman ɗifuu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""Leddi Florida hokki pat himɓe cappanɗe joi je woni be Romni man nasaru..."" which translates to ""Florida gave all 50 of its delegates to Romney..."" Delegates are the ""wakili'en"" (representatives) of the state. The passage specifies they are being given to Romney.
*   The other options are related to parts of the passage but do not directly answer the question about what Florida gave to Mitt Romney.
"
"Dou ko larani ndarteɗi majuun, chuɓi kashi noi Gingrich beɓi hanɗer chuɓi subtugo geto diɓe douggini?","The correct answer is **B: Kachi 32**.

The passage states that Newt Gingrich received 32 out of 100 votes (32%).
"
"Dou ko ndarani ndartedi majuun, moi nder maɓɓe darni douggodu ɓawo tabbitinki sakama?","The correct answer is **B: Bachman**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bachman mo heɓi nasaru ha zaɓe Ames Straw je ɓe waɗi ha lebbi Wairordu sumai timmini hala zaɓe mako"" which translates to ""Bachman, who won the Ames Straw Poll held in August, ended her campaign."" This directly indicates that Michele Bachmann ended her campaign after the Ames Straw Poll results.
"
"Dou ko ndarani ndartidi, fijowobtoi'on ɓamtani goto nda'nde sakama ko sakitidum haa caucus?","Based on the passage, Michele Bachman timmini hala zaɓe mako (ended her campaign). The other candidates mentioned either continued their campaigns or withdrew later. Therefore, the answer is:

**A: Bachman**
"
Babal ndeyere mara'no ha'je hollinli haa ton nder ndungu 2015?,"The correct answer is **C: Sare shakol kubaruji nga AstraNet**.

The passage states that ""De 2015 badi timmugo, Toginet mabbiti babal rediyo AstroNet ha les majum,"" meaning that AstroNet radio started broadcasting in late 2015. Therefore, it was a new radio station that began broadcasting at the end of 2015.
"
Shi'okon vangini kollete'ɗum gaam hemuki ɗume?,"Based on the information provided, the correct answer is **A: Amateur**.

Here's why:

*   The description highlights that the program is available only on internet radio ""TogiNetRadio""
*   The program is created by people without training.

The clues provided strongly suggest it's not professional or widely recognized, which aligns with the definition of ""Amateur."""
Mouftorde ndeyere David ardini jei latti futtingo durwol mouftorde sojien?,"Based on the provided text, the answer is **A: Hubaruu**.

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""David Headley`s **dabbutogo habar**...""  This translates to ""David Headley's **intelligence gathering**..."" or ""seeking of news/information"".
*   The question asks: ""Mouftorde ndeyere David ardini jei latti futtingo durwol mouftorde sojien?"" meaning approximately: ""What important thing that David led, resulted in futtingo (affecting) the military thing"".
*   Since David Headley's main role was intelligence gathering (hubaruu), that makes him responsible for the success of the attacks."

The passage states ""Fijerde Nadal nyami 7-2 be himɓe kanada o wowi fijugo"" which translates to ""Nadal won 7-2 against the Canadian he is used to playing."" This clearly indicates Nadal won the match against Raonic. The other options are incorrect because the passage specifically states that Nadal won with a score of 7-2.
"
"Dou ko ndarani ndartidi, ɗume darwa haa Nadal be nanta Raonic's durwol, ɓawo arandewol?","The correct answer is **B: Nadal nyami 76 points**.

The passage states, ""Nadal nastini kwalloji 88% ha nder ragaraga pointiji nyamugo fijirde mai **76 pointiji** ha wakkati be fuddi ɓawo fijerde maɓɓe..."" (Nadal achieved 88% on his first serve and **won 76 points** during the match...)

Demngal ngalewal nasdinaka haa chaakol kubaruji tati kesi ɗi Naked?,"Based on the passage, Naked voli hala ɓeddugo yare leddi fere yahugo habaruji to Spanish, Italian, and Korea.

Therefore, the answer is:

*   **A: himɓe Italia**
*   **B: himɓe Korea**
*   **D: himɓe Span**

All three are correct."
"Dou ko ndarani ndartidi, haa toi new Naked news broadcasts heɓete?","The correct answer is **A: Waya jungo**, **B: Intanet**, and **D: TV**.

The passage explicitly states that Naked News wants to expand to television, web (internet), and mobile devices (waya jungo)."
Fijoube noi'on latti timmitinai Gaint Slalom?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

The passage states: ""fijoɓe 45 nder 117 woni Giant Slalom so'e heɓɓugo darnde ha nder narjirde majum"" which translates to ""45 out of 117 in the Giant Slalom managed to finish and get a place in the standings.""
"
"Nder halaji do, toi on yaadi dede be jawabu fijirle artiide Championship saali do?","The correct answer is **A: Haa fijirle ɗiɗaure, Carpenado timmini bako komoi moo Hungary** (In the second race, Carpenado finished behind someone from Hungary).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""Giyongi Dani ɓii Hongare fu yottii be minti 1:09.02 bako mako."" This translates to ""Giyongi Dani from Hungary also finished 1:09.02 minutes ahead of him/her (Carpenado)"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Fijoɓe 45 timminai duggudu maɓɓe haa Giant Slalom man** (45 people finished their race in Giant Slalom). The passage says ""fijoɓe 45 nder 117 woni Giant Slalom so'e heɓɓugo darnde ha nder narjirde majum"" (45 out of 117 participated in Giant Slalom) but it does not state that all 45 finished their races.
*   **C: Fijoɓe ɗuɓɓe timmini Giant Slalom man bako Slalom man** (More people finished Giant Slalom than Slalom). There is nothing in the text to directly compare the number of finishers between the two races.
*   **D: Carpenado on mo sappo timmingo ha Slalom man** (Carpenado was the tenth finisher in Slalom). The passage states ""O wari je sappo ha nder roɓe nasti doggudu je furundurde"" which translates to ""He came tenth, and entered the second race."" The passage does not confirm that he finished the race 10th."
Moi on nder ɗoo NBA man suɓi fartugo kam?,"The best answer is **C: Fijowo moi on ɓe foodi mari COVID-19** (A player who was found to have COVID-19).

The passage states that the NBA suspended play because a player, discovered after testing, had COVID-19. Option C directly reflects this information.
"
"Nder ko himɓe man vii, ɗume on waɗi saklii NBA be ko shaafi nyawu man?","The correct answer is **D: Fijowo fere nder Utah Jazz ɗo mari nyawu man**.

The passage states that the NBA suspended the season because a player from the Utah Jazz tested positive for COVID-19.  Option D reflects this information most accurately.
"
Moi on nyami goal je wadi Washington Capitals be heɓi nasaraku fijirde dow Atlanta Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **A: Nicklas Backstrom**.

The passage states that Nicklas Backstrom assisted on Ovechkin's first goal, which was the game-winning goal.
"
Moi on nyami goal je 60th mako ha wakkati fijirde Capital be. Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

The text states: ""nyamande didabre dum o nyami je jemma kanjum on je nde 60 ha fasluwol ɗo..."" This directly translates to something like ""his second goal of the night was his 60th of the season"". Therefore, Alex Ovechkin scored his 60th goal during the Capitals game against the Thrashers. While Backstrom *assisted* on a goal, it was Ovechkin who scored the milestone goal.
"
Ndei banki Northern Rock fuddi tefugo wallitide hedi gombati?,"Based on the passage, Northern Rock started seeking government help *before* it was nationalized. The passage says it was nationalized in 2008 ""do tokka be passara je company do jaba kugal gaggawa do hokka daga UK government."" This means the company sought and received emergency support *before* nationalization.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Wakkati rikici sendirki on (During the financial crisis)**. The passage explicitly states the bank sought help due to a crisis related to 2007.
"
"nder ko ɓe vindi man, Nder halajido hala toi on yaadi be goonga no Virgin Group heɓi daree sodi banki Northern Rock?","The correct answer is **D: Virgin Group waɗi shoggu fuɗɗano do banki man ɓawo banki man warti je fuu leddi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Kampani Vajin je Richad Branson habdi sodugo banki man bako ɗum wartta je leddi man amma ɓe heɓai nasaru."" This translates to ""Richard Branson's Virgin company tried to buy the bank before it became nationalized but they were not successful.""
*   And later: ""Virgin sodi ‘banki’ je funa husire, amma na (asset management) campani ba"" which translates to ""Virgin bought the 'good bank', but not the (asset management) company."" This tells us Virgin *did* eventually buy part of the company *after* nationalization and restructuring.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   A: This is partially correct. Virgin didn't buy the *asset management* company.
*   B: The passage states they tried to buy it *before* it became nationalized and they failed.
*   C: The passage doesn't explicitly say they tried to help with money during the crisis, just that they tried to *buy* the bank."
"Nder ko wani ha vindi man, Leddi toi on ɓe toonye be yerdaki doo Kyoto climate accord?","Based on the text provided, the correct answer is:

*   **A: United States** and **C: Haa Australia**

The passage explicitly states that the United States and Australia did not ratify the Kyoto climate accord. It also mentions that India and China did not have emission targets at the time."
Gomnati saali je Australia dow yerdaki be kingal Kyoto wadan siilah wonnaki ɗume ha leddi man?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **C: Vortingo kaa`e yaasi**

The text states that Australia didn't sign the Kyoto protocol because it believed it would hurt the economy due to a large amount of ""kujeji duddum je yewi do vurtungo nyjulbe lesdi yaasi"". This translates to ""lots of things related to exporting resources"". ""Kaa`e"" is an equivalent in this context.
"
Kugal ɗume ɗum hoshi koshiɓe fim do wada ha nder fim man?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Settile koshoɓe fimji kugal Australia**.

The passage mentions that the NPWS and the Australian Sporting Shooters Association selected people to film in a wilderness area, specifically four experienced shooters to do the job.  Therefore, they were hired for their expertise in filming in Australia.
"
Nder halaji do toi on yaadi dede be ekkitin ko faddugo nyu`e?,"Based on the context of passage P, the correct answer is **D: Ɓe sufti koshobe naiy (They chose four shooters)**.

The passage states that four people were hired to shoot feral animals. The other options are incorrect because:

*   A: The passage mentions training shooters, but does not confirm whether it is an introductory task.
*   B & C: The passage mentions that they were chosen as shooters.
"
"nder vindiji man, hatoi ɓe hebi sendirki man?","The correct answer is **A: Haa Rift Valley**.

The passage states that the fossil was found ""ha Rift waadiwol je kugal bincike ha Ethiopia"" (in the Rift Valley as part of research in Ethiopia). Therefore, the location of the discovery is the Rift Valley.
"
"Nder ko ɓe vindi man, ɗime on ɓe waɗi naa no ɓe tammi?","The correct answer is **C: Heftugo do sheda molecular man**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""In the findings, what did they do or what did they expect?""
* **Statement P says:** The fossil has molecules. ""Show what they found,"" said Berhane Asfaw.
* **Option C (Heftugo do sheda molecular man) translates to: ** ""Checking the molecular evidence."" This aligns directly with the statement that the fossil *has* molecular evidence and implies that the researchers must have analyzed/checked that evidence.

The other options don't fit as well:

*   **Option A (wanguko kiɗɗum ko saali man) translates to:**""The old thing that passed""
*   **Option B (Sendirki man) translates to:** ""His research""
*   **Option D (Janguko haa Rift Valley) translates to:** ""Studying in the Rift Valley"" These are not findings."
Dime on fijowo wadata gam o heɓa o sanja dillugo wakkati o fijata fijirde bidiyo?,"The best answer is **B: Resugo dum dow babal tati** (Translates to: Reading it on a three-dimensional level).

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses how the new Nintendo controller uses sensors to triangulate the player's position in 3D space. This is the core innovation that allows for more intuitive and movement-based gameplay.

Let's look at why the other options are not as good:

*   A: The passage does not describe actions with the controller.
*   C: While the passage mentions sensors, it does not talk about where the sensors are placed.
*   D: The passage does not talk about the device relying on air."
Ɗime on be wadi ɗum nanda be rimot tibi man?,"Based on the passage, the answer is **A: Kujeji dillugo ɗiɗi man on**

The passage states: ""Nandugo aquati larurgo (remote), je je do les kuje nafturgo didi (sensors) resi ha kombi..."" This translates to ""Resembling a TV remote, which has two sensors...""  Therefore, the two sensors are the distinguishing features that make it look like a TV remote.
"

*   **C: Be lorni firowal man yago Afghanistan** (They changed the plane and returned to Afghanistan)

So the answer is **C and D**.
"
ɗime on ɓe viai nder haharuji kuwoɓe Xinhua kesum handebo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ɓe lorni firowal man ɓawo yago Afghanistan**.

The passage states that the plane changed course and returned to Afghanistan after initially heading towards Urumqi.
"
Ɗime on Sara Danius setini wakkati kugal rediyo je o wadi?,"The correct answer is **B: Komiti man hebai amsa hedi himbe ɓedo huwida**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** Sara Danius said that the committee contacted people close to Bob Dylan to inform him of the Nobel Prize.
*   **Option B reflects this:** This option directly states that the committee received responses from people who worked with Bob Dylan.
* The passage talks about them contacting people who work with him (Bob Dylan)
"
Moi on ɓe heɓai ɓe volli be mako?,"The correct answer is **A: Huwoɓe ɓadiɓe Bob Dylan**.

The passage states that Sara Danius contacted people close to Bob Dylan (""himɓe woni kombi mako leetere"") to try to congratulate him and welcome him.
"
Moi on volli do alkawal kanjum on “ko ɓuri ko ɗime”?,"Based on the passage, Gordon Johndroe, the spokesman for George W. Bush, is the one who commented on North Korea's pledge. Therefore, the answer is:

**C: Gordon Johndroe**
"
Stapji noi Słania waɗi je leddiji fere-fere?,"The correct answer is **A: Ɓuri 2,000**.

The passage states: ""O wadi ko buri stamp dubu ni Sweden be lesde guda nogas e je tati"" which translates to ""He made more than a thousand stamps in Sweden and twenty-three other countries.""  Given he also worked in Sweden, the total number of stamps would significantly exceed 1000. The passage indicates that Slania made more than 1000 stamps for Sweden and 23 other countries so this would make the total amount well over 2000.
"
"Nder ko ɓe vindi ma, ɗime on larata kanjum on waɗi tanki man do fii si’a har junta?","The correct answer is **C: Thermal Expansion**.

Here's why:

The passage describes an event where a pipeline had to be opened to release pressure, which resulted in oil being released. This points to a reason for the pipeline opening and that's thermal expansion caused by heat from the generator house fire that caused the pipeline to open to release pressure. 
"
Noi waɗi babal ustugo man maɓɓiti?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is:

**D: Babal resugo je ɗiɗabun man wawata jogugo nyebbam ɗuɗɗum (The secondary containment area could not hold the large amount of oil)**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Fere (secondary) humtugo babal do lesti je fandu do wawa joga 104,500 barrels be wawai be hebbini je koh jogata."" This translates to ""The secondary containment area was not built to contain what it held"".

The other options are not supported by the text.
"
"Jonta ba, noi on ɗuɗugo diiyam nder Ninth Ward man?","The correct answer is **A: Kosɗe 20** (20 feet).

The passage states: ""Chi’e je je-nayi je ndiyam hebbini ha nder yotti har jutugo 20 fit yake iyende sembe je ɓe indi Katrina"" which translates to ""The Ninth Ward was flooded up to 20 feet during the powerful storm they named Katrina.""
"
"wakkati Hurricane Katrina, ɗime on fe’e ha Ninth Ward man?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: Diiyam man heuti ndarde kosde 20** (The water reached a height of 20 feet).

The text states: ""Chi’e je je-nayi je ndiyam hebbini ha nder yotti har jutugo 20 fit yake iyende sembe je ɓe indi Katrina..."" which directly translates to ""They said that the water filled to a height of 20 feet inside the Ninth Ward due to the strong hurricane they called Katrina...""
"
Ɗime on nder do Hamilton tabbitinai dum ko saɗɗa?,"The best answer here is **A: Babal nyauɓe man yahii**.

Here's why:

* **P** describes a chain of events starting with someone from Hamilton being diagnosed with a disease they likely contracted in Nigeria (where Ebola exists).
* **Q** asks what makes the situation in Hamilton concerning.
* **A** directly relates to the chain of events in P. If the person with the disease came from Hamilton, then the problem came *to* Hamilton.
* **B**, **C**, and **D** could be considerations, but they're less immediately relevant to the core concern raised in the passage. The primary concern is the *spread* of a potentially dangerous disease.
"
Ɗime on je ilmu jamanu yidi ɓeddugo famu do man?,"The correct answer is **D: No be waɗi duniya**.

The passage states that modern scientists want to understand how the Earth was created (""Modiɓe ilimi jamanu yiɗi ɓe famma noy ɓeI lesɗe, musammam ma noy be hebiri Duniya""). Option D directly reflects this desire to understand the Earth's origins. The question also specifically asks ""Ɗime on je ilmu jamanu yidi ɓeddugo famu do man?"", which translates to ""What do modern scientists want to understand more?""
"
"Nder ko ɓe vindi man, Kungal ɗime ensanda en huwi wakkati maɓɓeko ɗo?","Based on the provided text:

*   The text states that the Maryland Transportation Authority contacted the FBI.
*   This implies they involved the FBI in some capacity, likely for investigation or assistance.

Therefore, the best answer is:

**A: ɓe loowi FBI gam waɗa maɓɓeki man** (They involved the FBI to do the investigation)"
Ɗime on hebi hedi babal nastugo man wakkati maɓɓeki man?,"Based on the passage provided (P), the correct answer is:

**A: Be sukki ɗum fuu (They closed it completely)**

The passage states ""Be Naftiri Motaaji boola be sukki laabi buutuutu"" meaning ""They diverted cars and closed the roads completely."" This implies the entrance ramp was closed.
"
"Nder ko ɓe vindi man, ɗime on be waɗai bako mo hasata fotoji man mota fiya mo?","The correct answer is **C: Mo fotoji man hosi foto babal taruko ensanda man**.

The passage states that someone was trying to take pictures of Bieber in his car. Therefore, option C is the most accurate description of what the photographer was trying to do.
"
Ɗime on mo hosata fotoji man don no habda wadugo bako mota man fiya mo?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **A: Resi mota hedi Sepulveda Boulevard**

Here's why:

*   The text states, ""Pellel heɓugo talol TMZ wi ɓe faami do whoso hoto man dari be mota mako ha gefe lawol Sepulveda sai o habdi o hosa hoto kuje tindata je poliici en wati bako ha lawi fottata..."" This translates to ""TMZ reported that the person taking the photos was standing by their car on Sepulveda Boulevard when they were hit...""

Let me know if you'd like me to clarify any other part of the text!"
Ɗime on nder halaji do hadai be dede be halu je ardiɗo leddi man woni de ɓe lari ɓe tabbitini odo mari nyawu man?,"Based on the information provided in passage P, the correct answer is **D: O do nanda be piiyol** (He is experiencing flu-like symptoms).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Diga zazzabi be nawugo dande ni..."" which translates to ""From fever and sore throat..."" These are common symptoms of the flu.
"
"Nder ko be vindi man, hala toi on nder do naa ngonga dow ardiɗo leddi man?","The correct answer is **A: O wala nanda be piiyol**.

**Translation of P (to help understand):**

P: He is sick; a new sickness has afflicted President Arias, according to his brother Rodrigo Arias. The leader of the country made a statement but he has been spending many days at his house alone. ""From fever and sore throat, I am tired and I am working telecommuting. I don't think I'll return to my job until Monday,"" Arias said in a separate statement.

**Analysis:**

The passage clearly states President Arias is sick with a fever and sore throat. This is not the flu (piiyol). This information is not shared in this passage.

*   **B: O tammi joɗugo ha saare je asaweji ɗuɗɗi (He plans to stay at home for many weeks)**- The passage only mentions that he plans to stay home to rest.

*   **C: O ɗo mari jamu valugo hedi waya leddi (He is doing a good job of leading the country)** - The passage mentions Arias' condition, and does not make mention of his performance in leading the country.

*   **D: Nyawu man arti yamdi mo o fuu (Sickness has made him very weak)** - While he is likely feeling unwell, the passage does not explicitly state that the illness has made him completely weak.

**Therefore, A is the best answer, as the sickness he is experiencing is not the flu, according to the information provided in the original text.**"
"Nder ko ɓe vindi man, ndei on ɓe tammata Tropical Cyclone Gonu tammin sewugo?","The correct answer is **A: Bako yotta Maldives man**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Tropical Cyclone Gonu hit the Maldives with winds of 240 km/h. It then weakened, with winds dropping to 83 km/h.
* **This implies:** The cyclone already hit the Maldives and has weakened since.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The cyclone winds decreased yaago 83 kilometer hawa fu
* **C:** The passage doesn't mention the cyclone nearing its end.
* **D:** 149 mil haa awa fu yaake doggudu je hendu to majum yotta Maldives.
"
Noi on yawugo hendu man wakkati yako kerol Tropical Cyclone Gonu man?,"The text states: ""hendu man yotti doggudu 240 kilometers kala awa fu (149 miles fu awa).""

The question asks for the wind speed ""wakkati yako kerol Tropical Cyclone Gonu man"" which translates to ""at the peak of Tropical Cyclone Gonu"". The text refers to the peak wind speed.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **C: Mil 149 haa awa fu**
"
Toi on nder ɗo ɗum wala sakla be man doo voɗugo Karenia brevis?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Ɗum iri algea on**

The passage states that ""Tide bodejum do fe’a on gam dudugo Karenia Brevis"" and later mentions ""dum accata algae rima bedda ha dudugo masin"" and ""Algae en ɗo vurtina guuɓa je wawata itta ɗaɗi ha pat himɓe be liɗɗi.""

This implies that Karenia Brevis is a type of algae.

The other options are not explicitly mentioned in the passage. The passage describes some of the effects of the algae, but not that Karenia Brevis itself directly causes nerve damage or is the only thing responsible."
Toi on nder ɗo Karena brevis saldori waɗugo sam?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: Waɗudo Neurotoxin**.

The text mentions that Karenia brevis ""vurtina guuɓa je wawata itta ɗaɗi ha pat himɓe be liɗɗi"" which translates to ""releases substances that can affect the nerves of both humans and fish"".  Neurotoxins are toxins that affect the nerves.
"
"Nder ko ɓe vindi man, toi on nder ɗo wala waɗoo gam waɗeki Hurricane Felicia?","Based on the provided text, the element *not* mentioned as contributing to Hurricane Felicia is **D: Ndarnugo ambaliya (Building a dam)**.

The text mentions:

*   **A: Precipitation marɗum nafuu (Significant rainfall)**: ""Kuje lutti man waɗi iyende toɓi ha pellel ɗuɗɗum ha danneere man...""
*   **B: Timmingo iyede be filmago (Flooding and filming)**: ""...Simtugo ndiyam, ɗum yotti ínci 6.34 ha keeke fonde-fonde ha Oahu..."" This implies flooding. While the text doesn't *explicitly* mention filming, the phrase ""be siifini do ɗon mari 'nafu'"" suggests documentation, which could involve filming.
*   **C: Ma’eji ɗuɗɗi (Strong winds)**: The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale itself is based on wind speed, and the text refers to it.

Therefore, building dams is not mentioned in the context of Hurricane Felicia's effects."
Hala toi on doo Hurricane Felicia ɗum feure?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Ko fe’i haa iyede ɗo nafii Oahu**.

The passage explicitly states that the storm ""yotti ínci 6.34 ha keeke fonde-fonde ha Oahu, be siifini do ɗon mari “nafu”"" (reached 6.34 inches on the windward side of Oahu and was considered ""beneficial""). This directly connects the hurricane's impact to Oahu.
"
Nder halaji ɗo toi on do yecce asali ko fe’e ha Hungarian Grand Prix jee 2009?,"The correct answer is **C: ɓe farti Piquet Jr. ɓawo ɗon**

The passage explicitly states: ""Ɓe farti Piquet Jr. peetel ɓaawo Grand Priks Hungaria ha 2009."" This translates to ""They fired Piquet Jr. after the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2009."" Therefore, option C directly reflects this information.
"
Nder ɗum waɗi hatsari man?,"The correct answer is **A: Hedii dab yeeso darugo Alonso’s pit**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Piquet Jr.'s deliberate crash was intended to benefit Fernando Alonso. The likely way this would happen is if the crash caused a safety car situation that occurred *before* Alonso made his scheduled pit stop. This would allow Alonso to gain an advantage in the pit stop window.
"
"nder ko ɓ vindi man, toi on nder doo arti warugo do wakkati buri no jangoɓ ilmu buri yerdugo?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Waɗugo species man on**.

The passage focuses on how a new species arose through hybridization between two existing species of finches in the Galapagos Islands. The research highlights the formation of a new lineage that is now breeding true.
"
Toi on nder do tefoɓe man watar nder ɗereji maɓɓe?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: babal ɓe heɓi habaru species man**.

The passage discusses how researchers discovered a new species arising from interbreeding between two existing species of finches. This discovery is the main point of their findings. The other options aren't the primary focus:

*   **B: Jutugo balɗe maunuki man:** While the researchers likely observed the birds' lifespan and growth, the passage doesn't highlight this as the main finding.
*   **C: Inde species kesum man:** The passage mentions the names of the parent species, but doesn't specify a new scientific name for the new species.
*   **D: Culli gonɗi nder ndaigol man:** The passage mentions the Geospiza fortes, cactus finch, and Geospiza conirostris that contributed to the new population."
Hedi toi ɓe waɗata CowParade?,"The correct answer is **B: Haa wuro Bucharest**

The passage explicitly states ""Ha pellel wuro Bucharest ɓe waɗi weltare kawrita himɓe waawi diidi"" which translates to ""In the city of Bucharest they made a wonderful celebration.""
"
Nder halaji ɗo toi on volli dow asali CowParade masin?,"Based on the passage, the answer is **B: Bucharest City Hall on waɗi ɗum.**

The passage explicitly states ""Ha pellel wuro Bucharest ɓe waɗi weltare..."" which translates to ""Bucharest City Hall made the festival...""
"
ko waɗi Russia acci fadduki dow nafol II-76s?,"The correct answer is **B: ɗum hatsari** (it is dangerous).

The passage states that Russia stopped using Il-76 aircraft after a crash (""Roshiya acci no nafturgo iri jirgi man II-76s ɓawo ko fe’I man""). The reason for stopping its use is implied to be the crash, which clearly indicates that the aircraft is dangerous.
"
Dume on wani II-76?,"Based on the context provided, Il-76 is an aircraft used by the Russian and Soviet military since the 1970s. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: Jirgi leddi** (Land aircraft)
"
Moi on hokki Simpsons settile vindoɓe?,"The correct answer is **B: Simon on**.

The passage states: ""Ha 1989 o valli hautugo The Simpsons be Brooks be Groening, bo kanko fuddi hosugo kungiya vindobe shiri man."" This translates to ""In 1989 he joined The Simpsons with Brooks and Groening, and he started leading the writing team of the show."" The ""he"" refers to Sam Simon mentioned at the beginning of the passage.
"
"ndiga ko wani hedi Fluke, moi on leldata hajaji boɗɗi dow mako be valliti ɗe?","Based on the information given in paragraph P, the correct answer is:

**D: hinɓe Worɓe be roɓe man fuu**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions that Fluke spoke to both men and women who were overweight and interested in weight loss. Therefore, both men and women are included in the target audience of his speech about weight loss medication."
"nder ko ɓe vii ha vindi man, ɗime on himɓe fere yiɗa roɓe volla ɗow maɓɓe ko seɗɗa?","The passage states that the Fluke device is intended to *prevent* children from swallowing beads, so they don't choke. It also mentions it's designed to help parents identify which boys and girls have swallowed beads and to advise them on medication to prevent absorption of whatever the beads contain.

The question asks, ""According to what is said in the article, are there other people who like to swallow beads after them?"" The passage doesn't say that other people *like* to swallow beads. It is focused on children swallowing beads.

Therefore, none of the provided options directly answer the question. However, the closest implied answer is **C: Nyamu robe**, which translates to ""Swallowing beads"" or ""Eating beads"".

So, while the passage doesn't say people *like* to swallow beads, it implies swallowing beads is the relevant action.
"
"nder ko ɓe vii ha vindi man, duniya toi on ɓuri ko toi saklinki?","The passage states that Earth has more diverse things than Titan. So the correct answer is:

*   **B: Titan**"
Mayo be waluuje laari ndiyam hefti ha bandu duniyaaru?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

The passage compares a body of water to one on Earth, noting that you can see beneath the surface. Stofan mentions that only one other world is known to have more diverse features than Titan, and that world is Earth. This implies that Titan also has bodies of water. Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Titan**.
"
Je toi heɓugo ɗo ko awi je belawal heɓi?,"The correct answer is **D: Tabbitini dau dabbawa manga dinosaur ɗo mari belawal**

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses evidence suggesting that some dinosaurs had feathers (belawal). It mentions scientists finding evidence of carotenoids (pigments related to feather color), and that some dinosaurs may have had a rachis (central feather shaft).

The other options are less accurate:

*   A: While the passage mentions feathers, it does not focus on differences between animals with feathers.
*   B: The passage mentions that feathers can be used for both flight and temperature regulation, but doesn't emphasize the ability to fly.
*   C: While the passage describes the evidence scientists have found, it doesn't provide general guidelines on how to find feathers."
Ɗume on belawal dinosaur wala?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: Ha rachis**.

The text states: ""Ngam dinosaur wala liiliwolji joginga, ɗum be nyonata rachis... (Because dinosaurs did not have feathers with barbs, they would have needed a rachis...)"". This implies the rachis was a component of the feather structure dinosaurs might have had.
"
Volde toi on nder ɗo dau ZMapp na gonga?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is:

**C: Ɗon ha masayi ko hisnata je PALM fooduki**

The passage states that in the PALM study, ZMapp helped researchers understand aspects of the immune system and allowed them to learn about how the world responded, using this knowledge to develop improved treatments. This implies that the PALM study found some benefit from using ZMapp.
"
Je toi nder ɗo volde hulliti PALM ekkitoggo?,"The correct answer is **B: Je hakkilta lekki fudaama ha taati nyaudiigo, gotel nder on ZMapp**

Here's why:

*   The original passage discusses the PALM trial (koɓe fondi je PALM).
*   It also talks about ZMapp being used within these trials.
*   Option B correctly mentions both the PALM trial (Je hakkilta lekki fudaama ha taati nyaudiigo) and ZMapp (gotel nder on ZMapp).

The other options are either incorrect or do not directly relate to the PALM trial and ZMapp's connection within it."
Hatoi on lenyooɓe numata kesum rammuɗum je ɓurata nafugo?,"Based on the provided text, the most appropriate answer is **A: Chede siɗɗa nastata leddi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the new technology being developed at Stanford University Medical School costs only $1 to produce. This suggests that the technology could be affordable and accessible to people in countries with limited resources.
*   The passage highlights the potential of this technology to diagnose various diseases, including those prevalent in developing countries with limited resources.
*   Cost is important to low income countries

The other options are not as directly related to the main points made in the passage.
"
Lawol toi tukkata ha waɗa lenya dau kare kuugal?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is:

*   **A: Go’o ha US cent ko toi**

The passage states that the new technology being developed at Stanford can print materials that can detect various diseases for about 1 US cent."
"No wardi ha bindi mai, volde toi on dau lobate ɓattarri je na gonga?","Based on the passage, the most accurate answer is:

**D: Wawan latta na ɗuɗɗum nder mai tawi ha nder leuru** (It is likely that there is a lot of water inside the moon).

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that the stones on the moon are like very pure and good water, suggesting the presence of water or ice.
*   The passage says that the scientists did that (sent scraps to the moon) in order to understand the moon better with intelligent understanding.

The other options are less directly supported by the text:

*   **A: Ukkano ɓe taski fe’e neɓai ɗo** (They have found it to be quite new). While the passage mentions the experiment is intended to allow intelligent understanding, it doesn't explicitly state the experiment has completed and shown they discovered that it is new.
*   **B: Wonugu maɓɓe latti je leuru tampai andal leddi kuuɗe** (Their existence has led to the moon spoiling the knowledge of earth work). The passage doesn't support this.
*   **C: Wawan latta ko awi je leuru ustata** (It is possible to see things that the moon decreases). The passage doesn't talk about the moon causing reduction of things."
"No wardi ha bindi, ka’idaaji toi dau baabal hauti be kuuɗe leddi fe‘ata ha leuru?","Based on the information provided in passage P, the most accurate answer is:

**A: Leuru mai ɗo usta be hakkilil** (The moon is explored intelligently/carefully)

Here's why:

*   Passage P states that people are exploring the world and placing things on the moon after careful consideration. They are doing this to understand the moon better and to do it intelligently.

The other options are less accurate based on the provided text:

*   **B: Leddi mai tagaama iga faɓɓi** (The earth was created from the start): The passage doesn't talk about the creation of the earth.
*   **C: Ɗon je siɗɗa je leddi tagaama ha baabal leuru kanjum tan ha babal man** (The only thing that was created on the moon is that thing on it): This isn't directly supported. The passage mentions placing objects, but not the specific origin of everything on the moon.
*   **D: Leddi tagaama gonga neɓai ɗo** (Earth was created after): The passage is about exploring and adding things to the moon."
"No wardi ha bindi mai, ɗume on lattata ɗon jur sai to tuumi?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: Tappugo footooji**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that people are taking and sharing photos in connection with the case, and Pamela Ferguson warns against it, suggesting it can prejudice the case. The warning from the government agency also implies the risk of sharing information that could be harmful or inaccurate."
"No wardi ha bindi mai, ɗume on na ko fe’ata jutta be filooɓe?","Based on the provided information in P (which appears to be in Fulfulde), and the question in Q, we can infer the following:

*   **P describes a situation about cancer, focusing on its prevalence or characteristics over time.** Phrases like ""mallimalloje man"" and ""himbe je daggi totton"" likely refer to cancer and people affected by it. The mention of Pittman suggests an expert or study.

*   **Q is asking about what's causing the rise of cancer among children.**

Given this understanding, the best answer is:

*   **A: Yanayi je masin (Poor environment)**

Here's why:

*   **Poor environment** encompasses a broad range of factors that are well-known to contribute to increased cancer risk, including exposure to toxins, pollution, poor diet, and lack of access to healthcare.

While the other options might be relevant to cancer in general, they are less directly tied to a cause of *increasing* cancer rates, especially in children. Thus, focusing on the underlying causes that lead to cancer is the most reasonable approach."
"Ha ɓeddaari kankaraaji mai, ɗume fahin vonnata be hapdata valla?","Based on the context of the prompt and the potential meaning of the answer options in the given language, the most appropriate answer would be:

**C: Soide vallowo**

**Explanation:**

*   The question asks about additional factors beyond cancer that are relevant to the situation.
*   ""Soide vallowo"" likely refers to the act of ""helping"" or ""assisting"". The passage discusses things people do and their health.

The other options are less likely to be correct:

*   **A: Soide wadduɓe:** Might refer to reasons for doing things.
*   **B: No yanayi woni:** May refer to the environment or nature. While environmental factors can play a role in health, it's less directly related to the passage.
*   **D: Ha sorooɓe:** Might refer to thieves.
"
Yerduye toi on je Roberts acci tabutunki?,"The correct answer is **B: Ha nafu je yaarugo kotu manga lamata**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions Roberts changing his stance after being appointed, emphasizing the ""role of the Court in society."" This directly aligns with the concept of ""the importance of maintaining the legitimacy of the Supreme Court.""
*   The passage states that Roberts sought to create a narrow ruling with as little disruption of precedents as possible, focusing on the broader institutional interests of the Court rather than a specific ideological outcome.

The other options are less relevant to the main point being made:

*   A: Although relevant, the focus is on the authority and significance of the court as a whole.
*   C: Not relevant to the text.
*   D: While relevant, the Roberts is trying to maintain the balance for the long term health of the court."
Dau ɗume Robert laari na needi ba San dau geuta mai?,"The correct answer is **B: Ha Roe. V wade kiita**.

The passage explicitly states that Robert changed his stance on Roe v. Wade and started referring to it as ""doka wuro je ɓe darni"" (a law established at home/locally). The passage focuses on his shift in opinion regarding this specific case.
"
Hatoi ɗiɗi je diidol hiiti ɗelkata?,"Based on the information in passage P, the two beams of light were seen ""in a tall, five-story building on the site, built with a path and a small forest in the middle of the site"". This points to the answer being **D: Ha nder caka memorial park** (In the middle of the memorial park).
"
"No wardi ha bindi mai, ndei hisɓe feccooɓe nyiɓaama gal mai?","Based on the passage, the event happened at 8:49 AM. Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **B: Ha 8:46 am.**

Note that the time in the passage is 8:49 AM, and the closest option is 8:46 AM. It is possible that the 8:46 is a typo, and should have been 8:49."
Habaru toi on sauri dau addiraaɓe juy e ɗiɗi ɗum loowe ?,"Based on the text provided, the most logical answer is:

**D: Footooji luuwe je duniyaaru**

Here's why:

*   The text describes Pat pellel nastugo cave mai.
*   The text describes holli dow yanayi pellel man be nange fere on be yanayi pellel man be jemma bo ɗo holla ɗo pellel man bana lohol on.

Therefore, it is likely the subject of the passage is about images of celestial bodies (luminous body/moon)."
Noi on yanayi gulɗum je addiraaɓe joy e ɗiɗi famata?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Infrared footooji**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Kuje hoto naftirta hite min wawata larugo holli dow yanayi pellel man be nange fere on be yanayi pellel man be jemma bo ɗo holla ɗo pellel man bana lohol on."" This means the photos being used are able to detect differences in temperature between day and night. Infrared photography is specifically used to detect heat and create images based on temperature differences.
"
"No wardi ha bindi mai, volde toi on nder mo ɓe tumata na gonga?","The correct answer is **D: O naunai (He was injured).**

The passage states: ""ɓawo o nauni diga masibo bom man"" which translates to ""after he was injured by the bomb explosion"".
"
Habaruji toi on ko wadi be waddi mai tabitinai?,"Based on the context provided, the correct answer is likely **B: Ha kabilanci mo ɓe tumata**

Here's why:

*   The passage describes the arrest of someone suspected of a bombing. The authorities only know that the suspect is Uyghur. This implies that their suspicion is based on the person's ethnicity (kabilanci).

Let's break down why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Ha asli je ko toi sobaajo vallata:** ""The origin is where a friend helps"" - This doesn't directly relate to the information given.
*   **C: Hujja ko waɗi ɓe fasi:** ""Evidence that made them break up"" - This is about ending a relationship, which is irrelevant.
*   **D: Aran be lagare indi mo ɓe tumata:** ""First they lied to the person they suspect"" - While lying is possible, it's not the most direct reason for the initial suspicion of a suspect whose identity is unknown.

Therefore, **B** is the most appropriate answer.
"
Moi on fijata haje warande ha Ellis Park?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: South Africa be Australia**.

The passage states that ""yake himɓe fijerde Springboks fijata be himɓe fijerde wuro Ostreliya"" which translates to ""that the Springboks team plays with the team from Australia"". The Springboks are from South Africa. Therefore, the match at Ellis Park was between South Africa and Australia.
"
Hatoi ɓe fiyata fijirde springbok je warande?,"The correct answer is **A: ha Australia**.

The passage states: ""yake himɓe fijerde Springboks fijata be himɓe fijerde wuro Ostreliya."" This translates to ""so the Springboks team will play with the team from Australia.""
"
Je toi nder ɗo hokki baabal masala ha wakkati nufoye?,"Based on the passage, the problem that was solved during the mission was:

*   **B: Sigugo gyroscope** (Sending a gyroscope to space)

The passage clearly states that they sent a gyroscope to space and that after the mission was complete, things were returned to normal. This implies that the gyroscope was sent to address a specific problem."
"No wardi ha bindi mai, ɗume on hujja fellel station mission man?","Based on the text you provided (P), the correct answer is:

**A: Tefugo gyroscope je majji** (Finding the missing gyroscope)

The text explicitly states that the mission involved ""sende gyroskop arande ha baabal je yaasi duniyaru man"" which translates to sending a gyroscope to the outside of the Earth. This implies that the gyroscope was needed, likely because one was missing or malfunctioning.
"
Je toi nder volde ɗo dau ko fe’e na gonga?,"The correct answer is **B: Kiita waɗaama.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states a lawsuit (Matsala) was completed.**  The entire passage revolves around this lawsuit.
* **A: Ɓe hiiti ha baabal je AOL hedkwata:** The passage doesn't explicitly state where the lawsuit took place, only that it involved AOL and was related to spam emails.
* **C: Ka’idi email je wala nafu naftiri ha kiita mai:** The passage mentions that spam emails were related to the lawsuit.
* **D: AOL ɓe caaji:** The passage doesn't say whether AOL won or lost the case. It simply states that a settlement was reached.

Therefore, the most accurate and directly supported statement from the passage is that a lawsuit occurred.
"
Je toi nder volde ɗo tindin bana ko fe’e?,"The correct answer is **D: AOL nastini kiita haureji mai.**

Here's why:

* **P** states that the issue was about AOL and spam email. It implies AOL was involved in a legal case concerning unsolicited emails.
* **D** directly mentions AOL being involved in a lawsuit regarding spam. This aligns with the information presented in **P**.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: AOL ɓe caaji ko ɗaɓɓitaaka senduki** is partially true, but not the whole picture. It hints at the issue but doesn't say AOL initiated the legal action.
* **B: Ha kiita mai hauti be ɗiɗi ardiiɓe ɓe hokkata howuki intanet** is irrelevant to the context of the original statement.
* **C: Ɓe hiiti kiita mai 2003** While P mentions 2003, it talks about a time period, not necessarily when the lawsuit was ruled upon.
"
No wardi ha bindi mai mufgal toi on Vidal fuɗɗi fijingo je hitaade tati ko saali ?,"The correct answer is **C: Barca**.

The first sentence states ""Vidal mo duɓi mako 28 wari Barsa duɓi ɗiɗi je Sali diga Sevila."" This translates to ""Vidal, at the age of 28, came to Barca two years ago from Sevilla."" The question asks ""Where did Vidal begin playing three years ago?"" Since he was at Barca for two years and came from Sevilla, he must have been playing at Sevilla three years ago. However, we are looking for where he started to play at. The passage doesn't explicitly state where Vidal first started playing professionally. Based on the information, it's safe to assume that it will most likely be Barcelona since it is mentioned as the club he went to at the age of 28. 
"
Fijirde noi on Vidal fijini Barça?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The passage states ""Tun eggugo yahugo Catalan-capital, Vidal fiyini club man de 49"" which translates to ""Since moving to the Catalan capital, Vidal played for the club 49 times"".
"
Be settile toi ɓe ɗonno waaɗa fijirde man?,"The passage states that the event took place in Bologna. Therefore, the answer is:

**B: be Bolonia**
"
Ko waɗi Jarque juɗata ha ci’i walugo?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: O ekkiti on** (He trained there).

The passage states ""Jarque do kuuki wakkati ekkutuggo bako firluwol fijideji warta ha Coverciano ha Italy..."" which translates to ""Jarque spent time training as a coach at Coverciano in Italy..."". This indicates the reason he was there was for training.
"
Ko waɗI Jakarta geophysics hukuma en barri?,"The passage P talks about an earthquake that hit a certain area, but it *doesn't* mention any specific actions taken by a geophysics authority in Jakarta. Therefore, the question ""What did the Jakarta geophysics authority warn about?"" cannot be answered from the information provided.

None of the options (A, B, C, or D) can be directly inferred or confirmed from the paragraph P.
"
"No wardi ha bindi mai, ɗume dimbugo leddi dasi?","Based on the passage P, the correct answer is **D: Je 6.5 mangu fooduki**.

The passage describes an earthquake that reached a magnitude of 6.5. The question asks what caused the panic, and the earthquake of magnitude 6.5 is the direct cause described in the text.
"
Je toi nder ɗo beddini ma sembi kugal naage be fu luttuɗi koode?,"Based on the context provided in paragraph P, the correct answer is most likely **D: Lamba Rossby, taruki be jamdi takkata**. Here's why:

*   **Paragraph P mentions the Rossby number:** ""ɗelkude man be no dillata on ɓe naftirta ɓe hefta numba Rosbi hoodere man"".
*   **Paragraph P refers to metals (jamdi):** ""...kode man wala sembe dasugo kujeji njamɗe.""
*   **""Taruki"" likely relates to the magnetic field or torque,** as the passage discusses stellar rotation and its effects on plasma. While not explicitly stated, it's a logical inference given the context of stellar dynamics and plasma.

Therefore, option D includes all the relevant elements mentioned or strongly implied in paragraph P."
Noi on heftata koode Lamba Rossby?,"Based on the information in passage P, the answer is **B: Limgal je jamdi takkata ilol** (The measure of plasma flow).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ɗelkude man be no dillata on ɓe naftirta ɓe hefta numba Rosbi hoodere man, ɗum fotan be je ilugo plasma."" This translates to: ""the speed at which these [stellar objects] move is used to calculate the Rossby number of the star, which is proportional to the plasma flow.""

Therefore, the Rossby number is related to and, in a sense, measures the flow of plasma.
"
Hasere je himɓe linciti ha fijirde Australia wartan jamhuriyawol ko ɓadi?,"The correct answer is **B: Hashi 29**.

The passage states: ""Bawo zabe timmi, 29 ha dow temerre der be bé tefi be nana ha mabbeyardi Australia hadI warta leddi be wawata suptugo ardiide mabbe hedi zabe be law-law..."" which translates to ""After the election, 29 percent wanted Australia to become a republic where they could elect their own leader through elections...""

This directly answers the question of the percentage of people interested in Australia becoming a republic after the election.
"
"Iga Julie Gillar, ndei Australia wartata jamhuriyawol?","The correct answer is **B: Ɓawo lamɗo Elizabeth mi laman** (After Queen Elizabeth I reign).

The passage states that Julia Gillard supported Australia becoming a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
"
Mufgal toi on ɗo les ka’idaaji lenyol?,"The correct answer is **A: Ha saare sembe be mufgal filu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage mentions the ""House Energy and Commerce Committee"" (Saare sembe be mufgal filu).** This directly links the question about the committee's area to the energy and commerce fields.

The other options are not mentioned in the passage.
"
Haire sasa hanjum on hoore mufgal toi?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Ha saare sembe be mufgal filu.**

The passage states that Stearns is a member of the **House Energy and Commerce Committee**, which translates to ""Saare Sembe be Mufgal Filu"" in the context of the language used.
"
"No wardi ha bindi mai, ko fe'ai ha rooɓe Swiss?","The correct answer is **D: Ɓe wujji waya mako be kwamputa**

The passage states: ""ɓe nangi himɓe joyi je waɗi raped debbo Swiss bo ɓe hefti mobile be laptop"" which translates to ""they arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and stole her mobile and laptop.""  This directly supports answer D.
"
Kwampani toi on heɓi caaho je Taiwan je Toskala je 2007 ?,"The passage clearly states: ""P: ASUS Eee PC..."" and further mentions ASUS being a major manufacturer in 2007 in Taiwan.  Therefore, the company mentioned is ASUS.

The correct answer is **C: ASUS**
"
Ɗume on ASUS Eee PC ?,"Based on the passage provided, the ASUS Eee PC is described as:

*   ""fuddi vurtugo ha duniyaru ni ustugo chede be barata be hala nafu"" - This suggests it's related to computing and making things more accessible.
*   ""nyamata lumo mai ha dou laptop computer"" - This directly says it's related to laptop computers.

Therefore, the best answer is:

**B: Ha kwanputa dango** (roughly translates to ""hand computer"" which is the closest to a laptop)
"
Moi on sanadi majjugo suudu waya mai?,"Based on the provided texts, the answer is **A: Howooɓe suudu waya** (Owners of the radio station).

Here's why:

*   The first passage mentions a ""hukuma radio"" (radio government) in Kenya.
*   The second passage asks about the source of something lost at the radio station.
*   Therefore, it is most logical that the question is asking who would be the owners."
"No wardi ha bindi mai, moi on tori munyal dau kondiwol majji mai?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: Ha hedi lelal obanazawa**.

The passage mentions that people in Obanazawa started showing their New Year's cards at the post office, indicating that the patience being tested was related to receiving those cards in Obanazawa.
"
Ndei on Del Potro yiɗi voitina balawal mako?,"The question asks when Del Potro claimed his ball toss. The text says ""Potro jabi kiwo je balbe mako ha wokkati man"" which translates to ""Potro claimed his ball toss at that time"". The phrase ""wokkati man"" refers to when ""sende be tefi fijirde sendirta be bawo be yotti 6-6"" which means ""when they had to play a tie-break after reaching 6-6"". Thus, Del Potro requested the ball toss at the time of the first tie-break (siutaare).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

B: Hiddai aran haɓɓugo siutaare
"
Ɗume on heɓi ha je aran haɓɓugo siutaare?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is:

**A: Murray do'i ha fuɗɗorde (Murray dog`I ha habbugo ko yewi bawo didi fu joji bandun em mabbe set.)**

The first sentence states that Murray won the first set.
"
"Ba vi ha bindi mai, Moi on asli ha nyauɗo?","The correct answer is **B: Ɓukkoi** (Children).

The text states: ""Hande min faami dow ɓikkon je yotti ɗuɓɓi nastugo jaangirde footi matinama bana nangi nyau man."" This translates to ""Today we understand that children who are about to enter school are considered as [if they] caught the illness.""  Therefore, the original text is referring to children as the source of the ""illness"" in this context.
"
No wardi ha bindi mai ɗume gonna mai waɗai de ɗo volwanq taxam en?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Kuje waɗaama ngam hisna ummatoore (Things were done to save the community)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes a government response to a situation in Texas.
*   The governor assures people that they will handle the situation and rebuild the city.
*   The governor mentions prioritizing getting children back into school.

All of these points indicate actions being taken to protect and restore the community. The other options are not directly supported by the text."
Nde kesum parody hautiiga Iga himɓe ɗiɗi hiɓɓe jangiiɓe UW?,"The correct answer is **A: Ha Colbert baadi**.

The passage states that Colbert's news parody show had some of the same writers as ""vindobe mabbe."" It also mentions the two people who started the satirical news outlet. So, the new parody is closely associated with Colbert.
"
"No wardi ha bindi mai, je toi wala nder hakkude je Tingeere habaru jawdi parody?","Based on the provided text, the Onion started as a **D: Ha tappitiiga** (in print). The passage says ""Tun artundere, Onion warti sare jarida manga ,be do fiya jarida..."" which translates to ""From the beginning, The Onion became a major newspaper, they were printing the newspaper..."". This indicates a print origin.
"
"No wardi ha bindi mai, ɗume on ɗan sandaajo hakkilni?","The correct answer is **C: Ha jippunki nastuki lawol**.

The text states: ""Ha 11:20, en sanda yecci himbe je vi be jabai ko fe’ata hota bawo ha sera lawol, be vi be yida kuje man hada salobe salobe saluugo."" This translates to: ""At 11:20, a messenger told people to move back to the side of the road, saying that they wanted the passage to be open, not blocked.""  This directly indicates the messenger's concern was about keeping the road open for passage.
"
Wakkati ndei on police en vii gaɗobe rikiciman acca babal mai ngan ɓe usta moftore?,"The answer is **D: Nder 11:20**

The text states: ""Ha 11:20, en sanda yecci himbe je vi be jabai ko fe’ata hota bawo ha sera lawol."" This indicates that at 11:20, people were told to move back behind the lines.
"
Dume oon ngoonga biditaaki kon Dr. Ehud Ur waɗata ?,"The correct answer is **A: Jawaabu man walliitan nyawɓe Diabetes Type 1**.

Here's why:

*   The text mentions that Dr. Ur is researching ways to help people who are predisposed to type 1 diabetes and aiming to find ways to prevent the disease. This directly supports the idea that his work helps those with Type 1 Diabetes."
"Daga bindol ɗarewol man, ɗume oon sakklata Dr. Ur ?","The correct answer is **A: Too biditaake man feeroteran ɓe himɓe nyawɓe diabetes Type 1**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions Dr. Ur's research focusing on preventing type 1 diabetes in people who are at risk. He's unsure if the treatments will prevent the disease, but he's investigating how they might benefit people at risk. This clearly implies a focus on type 1 diabetes.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: ɗibba man footi heɓana naa** (the study is worth it) - While the passage suggests the study is important, that's not the main conclusion Dr. Ur is drawing.
*   **C: Koo andiɓe feere’en wee dou ɗibba man** (other people know about the study) - This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Too doombi kon mara diabetes footi njoda ninnon** (people with diabetes should have them) - The study is to *prevent* type 1 diabetes, not to treat it in existing patients.
"
Volde toi on nder ɗo tindina asli do’ogo ferawal CG4684?,"The correct answer is **A: Piiroji man saldori jippugo ngam yanayi yendere man**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Wanchuru tefugo man vonni on gam nargewol je dasi be jippini jirgi man tan."" This means the weather was bad, preventing even rescue attempts from easily landing. The pilots were unable to land because of weather.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Piiroji man sue’iti haa kauye** the plane did not crash into a village.
*   **C: Piiroji man habdi jippugo nder tati deko sue’ita** the pilot crashed during their second attempt to land not third.
*   **D: Linyuki dau nukkuure do’ogo ferawal hauti be yanayi fu** the main cause of the crash was the weather not the location."
Ɗume haɗi piiroji CG4684 jippugo ?,"Based on the provided information, the correct answer is **D: Leeɓre sella ma wa’i , voɗai sam (Bad weather conditions made it very difficult)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the search was abandoned due to the danger and difficulty of the area, implying poor visibility or other weather-related challenges.
* It mentions the police having to be winched out of the area because it was too dangerous, reinforcing the idea that the conditions were hazardous.

The other options are less likely:

*   **A: Ha nukkuure jippurde mai hiɓataako (The landing area was not visible)** While poor visibility could contribute, the main reason for difficulty in landing and search efforts is that the *weather conditions* were severe.

*   **B: Wodi piiroji nduuɗi deko piiroji CG4684 (There were many planes besides CG4684)** The passage does not state anything about air traffic or other planes obstructing the flight.

*   **C: Piiroji maan tokkiti lawol Kokoda (The pilot followed the Kokoda trail)** The passage does not suggest that the pilot was following the trail or that this was the problem.
"
"Daga bindol man, wolwo toi oon dou kirsseku Franciszek Kowal’s gonga ?","The correct answer is **C: O yewi korowal ma yake o vurtata** (He saw the window and that's how he escaped).

The passage says: ""Fransizek Kowal mo heɓi wurti be yonki mako wi yeso windo man yewi sai ɓe fuɗɗi wurtugo diga windo man"" which translates to ""Fransizek Kowal, who escaped with his life, said it was in front of the window that he saw, then they started escaping from the window.""

This directly supports option C. The other options are not mentioned or implied in the provided passage.
"
Ɗime on lowata haure dow nafu je Tropical Storm Danielle don no waɗa?,"The correct answer is **C: Naargeeji man daƴi be ladnifol man** (The storm originated from a tropical disturbance).

Here's why:

*   The passage describes Danielle as a tropical storm that developed in the Atlantic. Tropical storms always originate from disturbances.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the passage talks about the storm strengthening, it doesn't primarily focus on a low-pressure system.
*   **B:** The passage mentions forecasters, but it doesn't say the storm was CREATED by scientists.
*   **D:** The passage mentions the storm being about 3,000 miles from Miami, but the storm didn't start there."
"Daga bindol man, toi njum oon wolwo dou naargeeji Tropical Danielle na gonga ba?","Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **B: Ɓe kauti ɗum ha maayo Atlantic.**

The passage explicitly states: ""...sa’a be wadi nargewol manga girgidum masin ha Atlantic, hauti ha funange mayo Atlantic."" This translates to ""...when it became a large tropical storm in the Atlantic, located in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nafu man dullaajon oon haa Caribbean** - The passage mentions it's unknown what it will do to the United States *or* the Caribbean, implying a potential, but not guaranteed, impact.
*   **C: Wawan so’ita yahgo naargeji nduuɗi** - While the passage states it's expected to strengthen, it doesn't explicitly mention it will overtake or influence other storms.
*   **D: Ɗou ɓadi be landifall** - The passage indicates the storm is currently far from land (3,000 miles from Miami) and that it is *not* currently headed toward land."
"Daga bindol man, kon ɓe wolwi ɗou nyaaunde dole fuiita ngam global endemic na ?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Dole oon laata ɓaɗinde be waade seɗa oon** (It is likely to become endemic and less severe).

The passage states: ""Jangirdeji fere numi nyauji dole warta sedda bako wata warta nyauji manga je pat duniyaru, o fami."" This translates to ""Some scholars believe the disease is likely to become less severe rather than become a major pandemic, as they understand it.""  This directly supports the idea that it will become endemic (meaning it will be consistently present in a population) and less severe.
"
"Daga bindol ɗareji man, noi dayandere Fujian ɓe Typhoon ?","The correct answer is **C: Kilomita 70**

The passage states that ""Dayugo man yottan kilomita cappande je ɗiɗi"" which translates to ""Its range reached seventy kilometers.""
"
Moi hufni Gerge W. Bush yaake o wari Asia ?,"The correct answer is **D: Wakili arɗido waziirie’e**

The text states: ""Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng je Singapore on hofni mo..."" which translates to ""Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng of Singapore greeted him..."" Deputy Prime Minister translates to Wakili arɗido waziirie’e in this context.
"
Moi on Ardido lesdi man wolwini hala fisintiru cuggu Asia ?,"The correct answer is **C: Ɓawo do’ugo mako zabe** (After he arrived at the polls).

The text states: ""ɓawo aseere be yake Bush do’i ha zaaɓe fuɗɗorde o woli hala ɓeddugo yeeyude ha Asiya"" which translates to ""after the visit and after Bush arrived at the first polls, he talked about increasing trade in Asia"".
"
"Daga bindol dareji man, toi oon kon gwamnati man ƴiɗi heɓugo nasaragu ɗou majum ?","Based on the passage, the government wants to **D: Ustol nduudinaango koombowalji (Ustol nduudinaango koombowalji)**.

The passage explicitly states that adding 300 vehicles will bring the total to 1300, and this will help ""usta hebbungo himɓe ha pellel gotel"" which translates to ""reduce overcrowding in one place"". This directly indicates the goal is to *reduce* the number of people in a single location, implying a reduction in overall numbers or density, thus the correct answer is D.
"
Dume on gwamnati man wee?,"The correct answer is **B: Ɓe ƴiɗi ustugo bone himbe ngam koombowalji**.

Here's why:

The passage P states that the government is increasing the number of stretchers (koombowalji) so that people can more easily purchase things to alleviate poverty and to reach the maximum carrying capacity. This implies the government's intention is to reduce human suffering through providing these things.
"
"Daga bindol dareji man, wolwe toi on andirɗum ?","The correct answer is **B: Wala hulnuki kadin boo faa**

Here's why:

*   **P (Context):** P describes a situation where something powerful has come and destroyed their old strategy and brought fear.
*   **Q (Question):** Q asks what this means to them.
*   **B (Answer):** B implies that there is no fear anymore. This indicates that they have now adapted after whatever happened. This option most closely aligns with the prompt.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A:** No ɓe hulnata man usti masin (""Our fear has significantly decreased""). This is a close one but does not go far enough. The best answer to the question is that the old fear is gone.
*   **C:** Min ɗou hesna habre (""We will start another battle""). This is unrelated to the prompt, which is about an evolution.
*   **D:** Malum ilmu konu wee, habre man saɗan masin (""Oh, the master of military science, the battle is very difficult""). Also, this is unrelated to the context in P."
Wolwe toi oon dou zangazanga man na ngonga ba ?,"The correct answer is **C: Zangazanga man ƴiɗino jippugo CEP** (The protests wanted the CEP to step down).

The passage states: ""Lewru Sali ɗo himɓe ardata leddi man wi CEP je naneno acca kugal mako gam leddi man yiɗi wo’i na tsari maɓɓe ha zaɓe kesum warata."" This translates to ""In July, leaders of the country said the current CEP should leave their jobs because the country wants new people in their positions for the upcoming elections."" This clearly indicates the protests aimed to remove the current CEP.
"
Moi wee CEP man jippa ?,"The correct answer is **C: Commision nokkere Arɗiɗo Lesdi**.

The passage states ""Lewru Sali ɗo himɓe ardata leddi man wi CEP je naneno acca kugal mako gam leddi man yiɗi wo’i na tsari maɓɓe ha zaɓe kesum warata."" This translates to ""In July, the country's leadership said the CEP should leave their post because the country wanted to improve their electoral system for the upcoming election."" Therefore, the decision for the CEP to step down came from the country's leadership (Commission nokkere Arɗiɗo Lesdi).
"
"Daga bindol dareji man, ɗume oon gwamnati USA waɗai supporting haa gymnastics Nassar’s?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Tabbitinkoman**.

Here's why:

*   The text mentions that the USOC (United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee) and USA Gymnastics wanted to keep the Lari Nassar abuse scandal secret.
*   This secrecy implies a cover-up, which is a form of **tabbitinkoman** (covering something up or concealing information).

The other options aren't directly supported by the text:

*   **B: Heɓin ko himɓe wuro man kungal** (Help their home town kungal) - This doesn't relate to the text provided.
*   **C: Sayool caka ta’aneeki wajibu oon** (Sacrifice the middle of the obligation) - This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Jaari ndariɗum be hore maajum** (Independent decision) - While the USOC and USA Gymnastics may have made independent decisions, the text focuses on the attempted cover-up, making ""tabbitinkoman"" the more fitting answer."
"Nder ko wani haa halaman, ɗime on ainahin anniya USA Gymnastics be komiti United States Olympic yahata yeeso?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: Darteneki doe tabbitinkoman**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that both USA Gymnastics and the USOC want ""to transform the sport...to rebuild, so no one is hurt while they're training."" This clearly indicates a desire to improve safety and well-being within the sport.
*   The text criticizes past actions and indicates a desire to create a safe and nurturing environment. This implies a focus on setting new standards for the future.
*   The reference to Larry Nassar implies a desire to move beyond the scandal and set new standard.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   Option A is wrong because it describes something USA Gymnastics has not done. The passage says that USA Gymnastics ""wants to hold the news about Larry Nassar's sexual abuses secret.""
*   Option C is wrong because it is not related to the passage.
*   Option D is wrong because, although it is mentioned in the passage, it is not the main point of the passage."
Haa toi koombowal man dillataa yake kuje man fe’i ? ,"Based on the text, the correct answer is **C: Palawan**.

The passage states the submarine was initially headed to Puerto Princesa in Palawan.
"
Je toi oon ɗou koombowal man be wolwai nder bindol ɗareji man ?,"Based on the information provided, the correct answer is **D: Ɓe hokki juzu hukuma joweeɗiɗi soja ndiyam U.S (They gave U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet)**.

The passage explicitly mentions that the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet was given something related to the situation. The other options are either about the location or function of the submarine, not what was given to the U.S. Navy.
"
Moi on wolwi dow ko shaafi soja US e?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**.

The passage states ""Shugaban qasa je nasara Donald Trump, ha hala fere je be sallini hedi sekatari je bindi, vi sojaji Us dillan syria."" This translates to ""Victorious President Donald Trump, in another statement to his secretary, said US soldiers are leaving Syria."" This clearly indicates that Donald Trump is the one who spoke about the withdrawal of US soldiers.
"
"Wayna wolwa man, Lesdi toi oon mari hakke reynol soja mo ɓe nangi?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: Turkey**.

The passage states that Turkey claims the right to handle ISIS fighters captured by them, as European countries have refused to take them back. This implies Turkey wants to be responsible for the captured fighters.
"
Dume oon sanadi hasari man?,"Based on the prompt, the correct answer is **C: Labiji kosere** (Mountain winds).

The text mentions the plane crash occurred on a mountain (""dou hosere"") and describes difficult weather conditions. Mountain winds are a common factor in plane crashes in mountainous terrain due to their unpredictable nature.
"
Kala lawol toi oon hasari man laati ?,"From the context of the passage, it seems like the soldiers are trying to determine the cause of a disaster involving an airplane.  We need to figure out which option best describes the *cause* or origin of a disaster.

*   **A: Tefuuki** (This doesn't really relate to a cause)
*   **B: Vonninga** (This doesn't really relate to a cause)
*   **C: Kautalii** (This doesn't really relate to a cause)
*   **D: Koseji** (Most nearly means accident or disaster)

Therefore, based on the options provided, the answer that best fits the question is **D: Koseji**. Although none of the options are perfect, it is the closest to expressing what caused the disaster.
"
Ɗume arɗo’en ƴiɗi lata ɓawo mbeebake?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: Nduudina dabbaji layɗe (To protect wildlife).**

The passage states that the area where the river meets the land (hunduko maayo) acts as a wildlife habitat. This indicates a desire to protect the animals that live there.
"
Mahol toi oon muuka ndiyam man sankita masin ?,"Based on the text provided, the answer is:

**D: Sediment spread**

The text describes the river mouth (hunduko mayo) as a place where sediment is deposited, forming land and serving as a wildlife habitat. While the other options might be related to a river ecosystem, the text directly links sediment spread to the creation and function of the river mouth.
"
"Daga bindol ɗareji man, Moi hooki Amerika habaruji haɓre man ?","Based on the provided information, the answer is **C: Mo ɓe anda** (Someone they know).

The passage states that the U.S. received information from ""mo ɓe yeccai ko daga toi wari"" which translates to ""someone they know where it came from"". This implies the source of the information is someone the U.S. is familiar with.
"
nder ko be vii ha halaji do wolwe toi oon ngoonga dou mo ɓe kauti habre?,"Based on the information in passage P, the correct answer is **C: Ɓe wati bom haa nokkereji lesdi diidi man** (They planned to bomb in locations of both countries).

The passage states that the extremists from Somalia intended to carry out bombings in **both** Kenya and Ethiopia.
"
Haa nder himɓe dou moi oon na lawyajo ba?,"The correct answer is **B: Sakis Kechagioglou** and **C: George Nikolakopoulos**.

The text states: ""Lauya en je Greece andiibe, **Sakis Kechagioglou be George Nikolakopoulos** do mabbi ha kurkuku je Athens je Korydallus...""

This clearly identifies Sakis Kechagioglou and George Nikolakopoulos as lawyers. Petros Mantouvalos is also mentioned as a lawyer of parliament, so the answer is also A.

Therefore the correct answer is A, B, and C.
"
"Haa nder himɓe dou, moi oon noddai inde mabɓe nder kautal faɗde Greek ?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Lawyajo** (Lawyer).

The text mentions ""Lauya en je Greece andiibe, Sakis Kechagioglou be George Nikolakopoulos,"" which translates to ""Lawyers in Greece..."" This clearly identifies lawyers as being among the people mentioned in the context of Greek affairs.
"
Wickets noi Lesdi India felji?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**

The passage states, ""amma ɓawo ɓe heɓai nasaru de arɗo kawrital fijerde Indiya man fiji, rons guda 36 kawrital man waɗi bo ɓe do’i wikets kuda 7 de figerde man timmi,"" which translates to, ""but after they did not score a century, the India cricket team scored 36 runs and lost 7 wickets and the game ended.""
"
"Daga bindol dareji man, innings noi oon ɓuri nduudugo ?","The correct answer is **C: ronji 100**.

The passage mentions that Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid each scored a century (100 runs).
"
Nder dou fuu ɗume oon na kaje masibo Adam Cuerden ?,"The correct answer is **B: Woggugo art Wales man**.

The passage states that Adam Kuwerden is complaining about ""Wales"" removing his work. This translates to ""Woggugo art Wales man"" in the given options.
"
"Daga bindol dareji mna, Ɗume ɓe woggi ha bange man ?","Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **D: Marko media-hore**.

The text mentions a site that hosts ""milyonji media ɗum wala haaje laasisi,"" which translates to ""millions of media without copyright."" This implies the site is hosting content without proper licenses, meaning it's infringing on **copyrights** related to media.
"
"Daga bindol ɗareji mna, ɗume Amir Khan fowrata ?","The correct answer is **A: Nastol rowɓe nder fijirde habre haa olumpiks**.

Here's why:

* **P states:** Amir Khan won a silver medal at the 2004 Olympics in boxing. The first sentence of P mentions ""Na komoi hokki nyaamna dow nastungo ro’be matsayi mai ba."" This translates to something related to ""entering men's competition at a certain level."" Given the context of Amir Khan winning a medal, this points to his participation in the Olympics boxing competition.

Therefore, the most logical answer to the question ""What did Amir Khan win?"" within the context of paragraph P, is the men's boxing silver medal at the Olympics.
"
"Daga bindol ɗareji mna, toi onn nder ko wani haa ɗo ɗume Amir Khan fowrata ?","Based on the passage, Amir Khan is described as a boxer (""Mo hebi chardi Olympic 2004 Amir Khan vi’’ be gonga kam handai robe haba""). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Rowɓe fijirde habre** (Boxers)
"
Nde Peter Lenz maayi ?,"The correct answer is **A: Wakkati taskol fijirde doggira** (During a racing practice run).

The passage states that Peter Lenz died at the race track while practicing (taskata fuɗɗugo).
"
Moi onn Xavier Zayat ?,"The passage states that Xavier Zayat was ""mo ɓe watta fijirde be keke man,"" which translates to ""who was racing with him."" This means Xavier Zayat was a racer.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Fijoow fijirde doggugo (Race car driver/Racer)**
"
Wakkati toi on firoowo piiroji nanata beldum no pirroji man kuuwata?,"The correct answer is **C: To fasinja’en andirde no piirooje koowata**

Here's why:

* **P (The Prompt):** Discusses how understanding how airplanes work can reduce fear of flying. It mentions how knowing the science behind flight helps dispel anxieties.
* **C (Option C):** Directly states that understanding how airplanes work helps passengers feel more comfortable.

The other options are less directly related to the prompt's main point:

* **A:** Passengers being ashamed of their fear is an additional stress factor instead of a method to reduce it
* **B:** The passage talks about understanding the physics, not trusting the pilot.
* **D:** Going on the trip despite the fear, doesn't necessarily mean the fear has subsided, only that they are brave enough to go through with it.
"
"Daga binbdol dareji man, ɗume oo dillowo mon ƴiɗi andirɗi cede yobul waɗata?","Based on the passage, the traveler wants to know **how to find the best price (chede yobul waɗata)**. The passage suggests that different airlines have different prices, and you should look at the airline's website directly. Therefore, the best answer is:

*   **D: Moostina shafi intanet kanfani pirroje man (Visit the airline company's website)**

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Tefa noi ƴoɓata haa kanfani jahaangle feere-feere (Search how to pay at different airline companies)** - While related to payment, the passage emphasizes finding the best price, not just *how* to pay.
*   **B: Yoɓu hedi babal ɓe firata man tan (Pay only for the flight ticket itself)** - The passage does not specifically mention paying only for the ticket itself.
*   **C: Foonda samanji kanfani jahaangle feere-feere (Look for the names of different airline companies)** - The passage doesn't focus on simply identifying different airline companies.
"
"No bindol ɗareji man we, ɗume on haani dilloɓe waɗata ngam heɓugo samanji dillogo e piiroji?","Based on the passage, the best answer is **A: Moostina shafi intanet kanfani pirroje man** (Visit the airline company's website).

The passage directly advises to check the airline company's website directly rather than booking through other means.
"
Nde haani vallitoowo ɗuftata kareji ?,"The passage describes situations where luggage/cargo needs to be handled carefully. Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: To ɓen turi kareji haa piiroji (When they load luggage onto planes)** This aligns with the part of the passage that discusses large companies using their own aircraft to transport goods.

*   **B: To kanfani man naftiri e piiroji mabɓe (When the company uses their own planes)** This is a general statement related to how big companies manage their logistics. The passage does not say that is a situation where someone should be careful.

*   **C: To kareji laati dai-dai ɓe ko be turi (When the goods are delicate or breakable)** The beginning emphasizes handling fragile items carefully.

*   **D: To ɓe leldan kareji man hedi kamfani mauɗum sosai (When they transport the luggage for a big company)** The passage does not say that is a situation where someone should be careful.

Given the emphasis on fragile items and the description of careful procedures for large companies using their own planes, the best answer is **A: To ɓen turi kareji haa piiroji (When they load luggage onto planes)**. Loading luggage on planes is when the luggage/cargo needs to be handled carefully.

The best answer is A.
"
"nder ko wani ha nder volde man, to goɗɗo suftan firowal njer kodai, kamfani toi on haadi ɓe riqa watugo gite do man?","Based on the information in passage P, the correct answer is:

**D: Kanfani piirol kon ɓadima hokkai hakkeji** (Airlines are close to giving up rights)

Here's why:

*   **P states:** ""...Goddo tamman dow tokkugo firawol kode hokkete ko belnatama amma toaa foodan tokkugo firawolfere a waawan hebugo ko buri tododo be chede man."" This implies that airlines might be forced to give up valuable code-sharing rights (firawol kode) if they don't compete with ultra-low-cost carriers. This suggests they are reluctant to give up these rights but might be forced to. Therefore, they are close to giving them up.
*   **The other options are not supported by the passage.** Passage P is about pressure on airlines to compete and potentially lose rights if they don't. Options A, B, and C do not directly address this pressure.

Therefore, option D most accurately reflects the situation described in passage P."
"Daga bindol ɗareji man, Moi hokkata hakkeji piirol nduuɗi ?","Based on the information provided, there isn't enough context to definitively answer which of the options A, B, C, or D is the correct answer to the question ""Daga bindol ɗareji man, Moi hokkata hakkeji piirol nduuɗi?""

The initial paragraph (P) discusses a general concept of weighing risks and rewards, particularly related to following advice (""kode"") versus independent thinking (""firawolfere""). This doesn't directly relate to aviation rights or the entity providing them.

To determine the correct answer, we would need more information regarding:

*   The context of the ""bindol ɗareji man"" (writing of permissions/licenses).
*   Who or what ""Moi"" refers to in this specific situation.

Without this additional context, it is impossible to definitively choose between A, B, C, or D.

**Recommendation:** Please provide more information about the situation or context surrounding the question, so I can give you a more accurate answer.
"
"Daga bindol dareji man, Yarugo mɓala masin ɗou laanchinta ngaandi toi ?","The passage describes the dangers of consuming locally brewed alcohol (""mbal""). It mentions that the alcohol can contain harmful substances like methanol, which can cause blindness or death.

Therefore, the passage strongly suggests that drinking ""mbal"" can lead to **blindness**.

The correct answer is **A: Nanotera**.  While ""nanotera"" isn't a standard English word, in this context, and given the other options, it's the most reasonable answer, implying loss of sight, or blindness.  The other options, ""Laardude"" (looking/observation), ""Meerude"" (mixing), and ""Luumnirde"" (place of sale/marketplace), don't fit the context of the dangers described.
"
"No kon wee ha bindol dareji man, ɗume oon leesnata masibo mɓal ?","The passage warns about the dangers of drinking ""mbal"" because its composition is unknown and can contain harmful substances like methanol, leading to blindness or death.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is **A: Yarugo mɓal e methanol** (Drinking mbal and methanol). This answer directly reflects the warning about the presence of methanol and its associated dangers.
"
Nder Amsterdam hatoi on samanji sare seɗi masin ?,"The correct answer is **A: Haa fadtude Canal**

The passage describes the Grachtengordel (Canal Ring) of Amsterdam. The question asks where one can find a very special kind of place in Amsterdam. The passage highlights the Grachtengordel's significance as a UNESCO World Heritage site and a culturally/historically important and prestigious area within the city.  Therefore, the Canal Ring is the best answer.
"
Ngam ɗume fadtude Canal wonitir je UNESCO haa Babal Tumtol Duniyaru?,"The correct answer is **A: Maari taarihaaji masin (It has a rich history)**.

The passage states that the Grachtengordel (Canal Ring) was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to its ""musamman be tarihi"" (special and historic) cultural and historical value. This directly translates to having a rich history.
"
"Daga bindol dareji man, Moi on nana beldum yillitore Phnom Krom ?","The passage states that Phnom Krom offers ""wa’ago tillde haadii"" (a stunning view) of Tonle Sap Lake.

Therefore the answer is **A: Moo laari daga douw Tonle sap** (A view of Tonle Sap).
"
"Daga bindol dareji man, ɗume haani koɗo waɗata to o nastan phnom Krom ?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: Nafturol koombowal dou Tonle Sap**.

The passage states: ""Be do mari haje kuje salugo Angkor to a nastan babal deena man gam mai ta yejjutu a warda be hoto ma je leddi to a yahan Tonle Sap.""

This translates to: ""You will need some kind of permission to enter that area from Angkor so don't forget where you're coming from or from which country you're going to Tonle Sap."" While this doesn't *explicitly* say you *must* take a boat, it strongly implies it, because it connects entry to the area to the direction of Tonle Sap. The main idea conveyed is linked to travel on Tonle Sap.

The other options are incorrect because:
*   **A: Vaa’a sala rewtirde Yesovarman:** The text mentions Yasovarman in relation to the temple's construction but not about a requirement to greet him.
*   **B: Yillitora Siemp reap:** The text mentions Siem Reap as the location of Phnom Krom. However, there is no implication in the provided text about needing to visit Siem Reap before visiting Phnom Krom
*   **C: Heeɓugo pass Ankor:** The passage describes that you will need to have some kind of permission from Angkor to enter that area. However, it is not clear if this means an actual pass. It also doesn't specify that this is a must, to be able to enter Phnom Krom.
"
"Daga bindol dareji man, ɗume haɗata hooɓe yahugo yillatore Antartica ?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: Wakkati ƙuɗeje acca ta ma jahangle nder lewru December e Jnairu**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states: ""Yaadu nanugo beldum do nawi, do yidi goddo mara jamu bandu, wakkati guldum Nov-Feb tan a wawata wadugo dum""

This translates to: ""Traveling is difficult and requires good health; it is only possible during the warm season of Nov-Feb"". Therefore, the limited time window for travel is the restriction."
Ganshowo giɗɗo hosereji toi on haadi o yara ziyara nder Antartica?,"The text states, ""...babe a wawata yahugo burna pat Peninsula, lesde chaka dyam be mayo Ross."" This translates to ""people can only travel to the Peninsula and the area between the seas and Ross Sea.""

Therefore, the best answer from the options is **C: Peninsula**.
"
Toi on hadi ɓe heɓta kujeji watugo gide je zamanu jonta?,"Based on the context of the provided text, the correct answer is **D: Nder makaranta kolej**.

Here's why:

*   The text mentions ""baabalji jaangirde,"" which directly translates to ""college classrooms"" or ""school classrooms.""
*   The passage discusses comparing things to the ""old days"" of studying.

Therefore, the place being referenced is most likely a school or college."
Haatoi ɓe jo’ini telescope zamanu ?,"Based on the passage:

*   **P** mentions: ""Baabalji jamanu ɓawo ɗum en naftiritta ngam leppita hooɗeeji ɓurna fu hiɗi jonta, bo warti ci'a larugo kare jamanu nane, ko bo **baabalji jaangirde**."" This translates to: ""Old telescopes are used to capture more distant objects now, and return to looking at things of the past, like the **university telescopes**.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Haa pellel jangirde** (At the university place).
"
"Daga bindol dareji man, fadtude toi oo ɓuri voɗugo ngam nyalande beach ?","Based on the text provided, the best answer is **B: Mission Bay**.

The text mentions that Tamaki Drive Beaches, which include Mission Bay and St Heliers, are ""ha chuɗi der upmarket je Mission Bay be St Heliers der Central Auckland."" This suggests Mission Bay is a well-known and prominent beach area within the central Auckland region. While St Heliers is also mentioned, Mission Bay appears to be slightly more emphasized in the description. The other options (Harbor babal hirna man and Waitemata Harbor) are mentioned as general areas, but not specifically highlighted as beach destinations.
"
"Daga bindol dareji man, haa toi a nginam wala masala ?","Based on the provided text:

*   Long Bay is mentioned as being in the north.
*   Devonport is mentioned as being in the south.
*   The Harbour district is mentioned.
*   Central Auckland is mentioned.

The question asks ""From the places mentioned, which one is the furthest south?"". Therefore the answer is **A: Devonport**."
"Tou a yilla pelle kon wolwina haa nder bindol ɗareji man, ɗume oon nder douw wontaa haanai ?","Based on the context provided, the correct answer is:

**D: Vonnugo mahol**

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes respecting and honoring the place. Painting on the building (vonnuugo mahol) would be disrespectful to its historical significance and the memory of those who suffered there. The passage specifically states ""Ta a wonna pellel man be diidol penti ha mahol man."" which translates to ""Don't decorate the place with paint on the building.""

The other options are less directly related to the instructions in the passage:

*   **A: Sirwugo tan** - This means ""just silence"". While silence is important, it's not the only way to show respect and it's not directly mentioned as something *not* to do.
*   **B: Watugu alamje haa pellel man** - This means ""setting up signs in the place"". While the placement of signs could be done disrespectfully, the general idea of adding informational signs isn't inherently bad.
*   **C: Jaleeɗe** - This translates to ""jokes"". The passage emphasizes that the location is not to be treated as a joke. However, jokes are not being done to the building."
Toi oon wonta asali wolde Francas ?,"The correct answer is **C: Kautelel**

Here's why:

*   The text describes a language that is created when people from different places need to communicate. This new language allows them to understand each other.

Let's look at what each option means in the context of a language created for communication between different groups:

*   **A: Faangaliire (Foreign):** While a pidgin might borrow elements from foreign languages, it's not inherently foreign in its entirety.
*   **B: Na asaluje (Not original):** This is close, but not the best fit. Pidgins *are* created; they aren't naturally occurring original languages.
*   **C: Kautelel (Created/Combined):** This accurately reflects that a pidgin is made by combining elements of different languages for communication.
*   **D: Organic ji (Organic):** This doesn't fit the context of language creation.

Therefore, **C** is the most appropriate term to describe the origin of a pidgin language."
Hala toi on waɗai asali bayani dow ɗemngal auxiliary?,"The best answer is **C: Ɗum ɗemngal je walititta himɓe fama koemaɓɓe ngam koiɗum** (It is a language that helps people understand each other for that purpose).

Here's why:

* **The prompt P discusses a language used for communication between people of different native languages.**  The purpose is mutual understanding, and Q is asking for a definition of an auxiliary language.
* **Option C directly addresses this purpose:  ""walititta himɓe fama koemaɓɓe ngam koiɗum"" - it helps people understand each other for that purpose.**

Let's look at why the others are less suitable:

* **A: Ɗum ɗemngal organic je ɓe naftirta gam ustugo bone worde caka himɓe ɓe nana dole on ɓe faama ko’i maɓɓe** (It is an organic language that they use to reduce the pain of words between people so that they must understand each other) - While it touches on communication, the ""organic"" part and the focus on reducing ""pain of words"" is not central to the definition of an auxiliary language.
* **B: Ɗum ɗemngal je ɗo hoyi komai wawi ɗum** (It is a language that is easy for anyone to use) -  While ease of use is a *desirable* characteristic of an auxiliary language, it's not the defining feature. The primary goal is to facilitate communication.
* **D: Dum yare je himɓe kotoi ɓuri famugo be wolwugo man** (It is a language that people mostly understand and speak) - This is too general.  A widely spoken language like English isn't necessarily an *auxiliary* language if it's used primarily by native speakers.

Therefore, **C** is the most accurate and relevant answer.
"
"Daga bindol ɗareji man, haa toi fasinja haani laara nder koombowal man wakkati Jaangol?","Based on the passage, the passengers need visas (ɗareji bisa).  Therefore, the correct answer is **B: ɗareji bisa**.

**D: Saint Petersburg**

Here's why:

*   **Passage P** mentions the journey reaching a city.

*   **Passage Q** refers to the journey to St. Petersburg."
Ngam ɗume ɓe naftirta Catalan masin ha Barcelona ngam bolle ?,"The correct answer is **D: Nder wuro be goɗi je wuro man be ɗuɗu naftirko be man himɓe vowoe Catalan on**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Catalan is used in many official contexts in Barcelona because it's the original language used by the local government (""gam kanjum on yaare ɓe fuɗɗi nafturgo ha doka maɓɓe""). This implies a historical and cultural connection, and a desire to assert local identity.

Let's analyze why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Komoi ɗo faahma ɗum buri ɗengal Spanish:** The passage explicitly states that almost everyone knows Spanish.
*   **B: Kajum oon lunnga asalai je wuro man:** While Catalan is important, the passage doesn't give that the main reason to use it for Barcelona's bolle
*   **C: Kajum lunnga kon himɓe ɓuri ƴiɗugo ha barcelona:** While reta ɓuri ƴiɗugo Catalan, passage man dum ba wada damina ha kanjum on sababu je ɓe naftirta dum wani dum Lunnga ɓe fuɗɗi nafturgo ha doka maɓɓe ."

*   The passage mentions that announcements at the Barcelona airport are made in Catalan.
*   It also states that announcements are made in Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **B: Catalan**
*   **C: Spanish**
*   **D: French**"
"Daga bindoul, toi der tokkidi kujeji lattai tilimdoum ha ragare leso be yewariko'e?","Based on the passage, the **bedding** and **hospitality** were the areas B&Bs focused on. While the passage mentions ""specialized subtracted items"" and a kind of ""sealed"" bedding system for temperature control, it doesn't directly equate to any of the answer options provided.

Therefore, none of the options are an explicit and directly mentioned result of prioritizing bedding and hospitality. However, option **A: Deftere subtetedoum je musamman kukuji tilimdi**, which loosely translates to ""Specialized and subtracted books (items) tilimdi"" is the *closest* to the discussion of special design of some items. However, this option is quite obscure and abstract.

Therefore, I cannot give a definitive ""correct"" answer.
"
Daga bindoul toi tokkidi doum na gotel nɗer asli dalila daddado hakkuɗe Luxury B&B?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Paune jamanu (Modern style)**

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that modern B&Bs are competing on bedding and hospitality. This implies a focus on contemporary amenities and services.
*   The passage then contrasts this with the older type of bed and breakfast, emphasizing modern features and comfort.
*   The last paragraph talks about the traditional old mattress.

Therefore, the underlying tension is between the traditional and the modern, making ""modern style"" the most relevant conflict.
"
"Daga bindoul, toi der tokkidi fed'ata ko ha Beijing der 2022?","The correct answer is **C: Biki mabbugo mofturɗe** (Opening ceremonies).

The passage states: ""Beijing hosan nauyi laawandu mabbutuggo be mabbugo bikiji be fijirde booju der sudu."" This directly translates to: ""Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies as well as indoor ice sports."" Therefore, Beijing is hosting the closing ceremonies.
"
"Daga bindoul, toi ɗer tokkidi lattan hahs fiirɗe Beijing hader 2022?","Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **D: Biki mbougomofturɗe**.

The text mentions: ""Beijing hosan nauyi laawandu mabbutuggo be mabbugo bikiji be fijirde booju der sudu."" This translates to something like ""Beijing will host competitions in opening and closing ceremonies, bobsleigh, and indoor sports."" Therefore, bobsleigh (biki mbougomofturɗe) is one of the events hosted in Beijing during the 2022 Olympics.
"
Moijo mari bourdoum battugobe rbugo nyawu avian influenza?,"The question asks: Who is most likely to be affected by avian influenza?

Let's break down the information in the passage:

*   Avian influenza is very contagious, affecting both birds and humans.
*   Some humans have survived, but others have died.
*   Many people work on poultry farms.

Based on this information, **C: Dorouɓe gertoɗe (Poultry farmers)** are the most likely to be affected. They are in close contact with poultry, increasing their risk of exposure to the virus.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C**."
"Daga bindoul, toi der tokkiɗi bolwadoum tindinta nyawu bird flu?","Based on the provided text (P), the most appropriate answer is:

**C: Larouɓe sholli buri heddugo ɓe nyawu (People are more likely to contract the disease from birds).**

Here's why:

*   The text states that the disease easily infects birds and humans (""raɓɓan pat collije be himɓe""). This directly supports the idea that birds are a source of infection for humans.

Let's analyze why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Durouɓe gertouɗe tn tangi nyawu flu (Bird farmers catch flu).** This is a plausible statement, but the text does not imply that only bird farmers catch the disease.

*   **B: Himbe buri nongugou benyawu man do sholli (People are more likely to get the disease).** While the passage mentions humans can catch it, it emphasizes that birds are very susceptible.

*   **D: Nyawu raabi himbe man gu ɓaruwu (The disease is spreading rapidly).** The text implies high infection rate but doesn't explicitly state that the disease is spreading rapidly.
"
Dume white sea-Baltic canal hauti?,"The correct answer is **B: Mayo lake Onega be mayo Volga**

The passage states: ""White Sea-Baltic Canal kam jun on hauti mayo Arctic be Baltic Sea, ha vendo Onega, vendo Ladoga be Saint Petesburg, buri dodogo be mayo be vendo. Mayo onega do hauta je Volga...""

This clearly indicates that the White Sea-Baltic Canal connects Lake Onega and the Volga River.
"
"Daga bindoul, irin bad'antewa jayaw sura fassfort jaɓete ngam to dilloɓe sukle?","Based on the description in P, the answer is **D: Jirgije hakkunde keroul leddoɗi (Planes between national borders)**.

Here's why:

* P describes a place where people entering from other countries are checked for ID and documentation.
* This implies crossing national borders.
* While passports might be used on trains (A), the explicit mention of ""jamma danobe jirgi leddi (passports)"" ties the process strongly to international travel by plane. Therefore, the planes between national borders is the best option.
"
"Daga bindoul, ndei ɗerejima liɗɗititte douɓe aerta keroul leddi toh don dilla ɗer jigi ɗenɓo adon ɗaani?","Based on the provided text, the question (Q) is asking about the moment when document checking is likely to happen *after* you get off a plane. The first text (P) describes passport/ID checks at train stations and generally mentions scrutiny.

The best answer is:

*   **A: ɓawo jippugo nder jirgi leddi man** (after disembarking from the plane)

This aligns with the context given and answers the question directly. The other options are less relevant:

*   B: Wakkati a ɗonno ɗana (when you are standing) - Too general, not specifically linked to travel document checks after a flight.
*   C: Doum wal lid'ete (That helps the lid'ete) - This seems nonsensical and not related.
*   D: Dou jirgi doggowal (on a fast train) - While related to travel, doesn't answer *when* document checks occur after a flight."
Toi ɗer tokkidi sha'ani ɓuri handugo ɓe judiido do tondije Singapore?,"Based on the description in statement P, which emphasizes the warm climate, need for cooling, and strong sunlight, the most suitable answer is:

**C: Nyawu shomri gouldoum** (Golden Shower Tree)

Here's why:

*   **Golden Shower Tree thrives in tropical climates:** It loves the heat and strong sunlight described in the passage.
*   **Other options are less suitable:**
    *   **Hebugou yeso funginingo (Wintering plant):** Implies adaptation to cold weather, which is the opposite of Singapore's climate.
    *   **Soiɗe lawoulippordoum (Snow Leopard):**  Snow leopards live in cold, mountainous regions and are completely unsuitable for Singapore.
    *   **Majjere (Desert plant):** While drought-tolerant, desert plants might not be the best fit for Singapore's humidity, and the focus in the passage is more on dealing with heat than drought."
Moijo yiɗata nyamuwa nyamdouji Germny?,"Based on the passage (P) describing delicious German sweets and treats, and understanding that the question (Q) is ""Who likes German food?"", the best answer is:

* **D: Gouddo burdoh yidugou nakam dou kaddoum** (Someone who really likes that kind of thing). This option is the most general and fitting answer to the question.

"Dags bindoul, toi der tokkidi sappataake sa'ejahangal be shede taskitiiɗe?","Based on the passage (P), the correct answer is **D: Famɗutunou majjingo shede dou nyamdu be haya sare** (Find out how to save money on food and accommodation).

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses finding ways to travel the world cheaply. It mentions working before traveling, reducing spending, and finding ways to travel on a budget.
*   Option D directly addresses the core idea of saving money on essential travel expenses like food and accommodation to make travel more affordable.
*   The other options don't align as closely with the main theme of the passage.

"
"Daga bindoul, moijo heɓata sadirma sa'e jahangal ɓe soinɗe shede?","Based on the provided text, the answer is **D: Gouddo mo yidi tokkugo tindinoore jahangal**.

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses cheap travel methods, emphasizing budget consciousness.
*   It mentions things like comparing prices, avoiding peak seasons, and finding the cheapest deals.
*   Therefore, someone who wants to travel cheaply would be someone who wants to follow travel tips or guidelines (""tindinoore jahangal"") to save money."
Toi der tokkidi bolwaadoum tindinai jutugo yahdu hakkuɗe Marion be Fairmont?,"Based on the prompt (P), the correct answer is:

**C: Keroul douggudu duudai tokkego**

Here's why:

*   The prompt directly describes the road between Point Marion and Fairmont as being bumpy, winding, and full of potholes, with heavy truck traffic. It also mentions that other drivers struggle to get to the speed they are accustomed to. These descriptions imply that travel is slow due to these conditions. This aligns with the meaning of option C.
    *   *Keroul douggudu duudai tokkego* - The translated meaning is slow speed is required for following."
"Daga bindoul, toi der di'e damata lanyoɓe dou Buffalo-Pittsburg laawoul?","Based on the provided text and the question, the correct answer is:

**A: Ɗaggugo ha moftorde doulawoul**

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions the difficulty of traveling on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh route (""...dum hauti salugo hedi lawol sakkunga""). It describes challenging conditions like congestion (""lawol manga saito a wati hakkilo masin"") and slow speeds due to heavy traffic (""Doggudu goɗɗo wawata waɗa jotta yottai je ɓe wati no, ɓe wowi watugo doggudu mph 35 yahugo 40""). So, the answer is **A.**"
Toi ɗer ɗiiɗo tefataske ha fuddugo canyoneering?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is:

**A: Wawugo ɗiyam on** (Being able to swim)

The passage states: ""Canoying do hauti kujeji daga vulugo dar diyam, va’ugo be diwugo"" which translates to ""Canyoneering involves dealing with water, including swimming"". This makes swimming ability a fundamental requirement for canyoneering.
"
"Toi ɗer tokkidi, lattata handidoum ha nyamugo fijirle canyoning?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: Wawugo ɗiyam (Ability to swim)**

Here's why:

The passage describes canyoning as requiring swimming: ""...a tawata do yori ko bo do hebbini be dyam (and also the ability to swim in the water).""
"
"Daga nder bindoul, dime wallata gouddou taskowo ɓalɗi ɗer babantewa?","Based on the passage (P), the option that best describes something helpful for families is:

**B: Ɓadantewa ashchowa koromje walire**

This translates to ""Family cars with assistive features."" The passage mentions the importance of having a car with helpful features when traveling as a family: ""Walugo ha der mota wadan to ado mari minivan je do yaaji, SUV, Sedan ko Station Wagon be mari korwal je walata,"" this translates to ""It helps if the car is a minivan that is spacious, SUV, Sedan, or Station Wagon that helps people."" The important part in all of this is ""korwal je walata,"" and it is saying to have a car with features that are helpful.
"
"Daga bindoul, dume judiibe der bad'antewa yidata luutugo to be yidi be gida fartegou?","Based on the provided text P, the best answer is:

**D: Sende fahmugo ɓadantewa be naftirta (Lack of understanding of the vehicle and its functions)**

Here's why:

*   **Text P** says ""...tema a arti a vowi be lanyugo mota ma bo a andi ko wawata wadugo.""  This translates to ""But it's important to first be familiar with your vehicle and know what it can do."" This directly implies that understanding the vehicle and its functions is crucial before embarking on a trip.
*   The text also warns about the dangers of off-roading without proper knowledge, linking a lack of understanding to potential problems.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Lanyugo bab'antewa manga bana SUV ko bad'anteji pamari (Renting a large vehicle like an SUV or small vehicles)** While P does mention different vehicle types, it's not about renting. The core problem discussed is a *lack of understanding*.
*   **B: Jahaangal juddun dou labeji (Long travel on sand)** While text P hints at possible issues to do with where one travels, it is ultimately linked to one's familiarity with the vehicle which is the focal point here, not just the journey.
*   **C: Hawtugo danki nder wuro ko bo nokkere marade (Parking difficulties in town)** Text P does not suggest that the difficulties may be linked to urban parking."
"Hakkunde bindol man, moi on mahi wuro Casablanca je maratol arande ?","The correct answer is **A: Ɓi lesdi Fortugal (People of Portugal)**.

The passage states that the Portuguese rebuilt the city under the name Casa Branca.
"
Moi sankiti wuro Casalablanca ɓawo masibo kon tawi dum?,"The correct answer is **B: Ɓi lesdi Fortugal (Himɓe lesdi Portugal)**

The passage states that the Portuguese rebuilt the city and named it Casa Branca.
"
"Hakkunde bindol man,noi Sintra heɓi be andi mo nder bature’en?","The correct answer is **C: Lartuki hala Lord Byron’s**

The passage states that Sintra became more well-known among foreigners after they heard about the good things Lord Byron had done there.
"
Dome oon be fahmai e Armenia ?,"The correct answer is **A: Wakkere Nagorno-Karabakh man**.

The passage states that Nagorno-Karabakh is where the conflict occurred between Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Azeris.  Therefore, Armenia would be associated with the Nagorno-Karabakh region in this context.
"
Dume oon do damata ɓadootiraaɗo cakka Azerbaijan e Armenia ?,"The correct answer is **D: Wakkere Nagorno-Karabakh** (The Nagorno-Karabakh region).

The passage clearly states that Nagorno-Karabakh is where the fighting between Armenia-backed forces and Azerbaijanis began, and is the central point of contention hindering peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
"
"Tou a hosi bab'antewa taxi ha Charlotte, dume oon woonita besdol cede taxi man ?","Based on the provided text, the surcharge is applied when having more than two passengers. Thus, the correct answer is:

**B: Marugo fasinja tati** (Having three passengers)
"
"Hakkunde bindol man, dume oon wontiran asara njunde haa Charlotte be ɓinkon ma ?","The correct answer is **B: Nastugo bab'antewa taxi**

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses families moving to Charlotte due to its attractiveness for families and a growing trend of accessible transportation for children in Charlotte's city center. It then notes that families in Charlotte use cars for commuting but may need alternatives. The final sentence mentions ""a surcharge that comes with more than two..."" This likely refers to a taxi or rideshare service (bab'antewa taxi) that charges extra for more passengers (possibly more than two children).

The other options don't fit the context as well:

*   **A: Samanji Sare**: This doesn't connect to the discussion about family transportation and accessibility.
*   **C: Joɗoɓe ha wakkereji goɗɗi**: This is too general. While where people live impacts transportation needs, it doesn't directly address the surcharge issue.
*   **D: Mi dou habda nanugo beldum wuro man**: This relates to the overall pleasantness of the city, but doesn't target the transportation concern outlined in the ending of paragraph P."
"Deko himɓe lesdi spain yotta, moi ardinta funa Chile ?","The correct answer is **D: Incas**.

The passage states that ""woyla Chile do les lamu Inca"" which translates to ""northern Chile was under the rule of the Inca.""
"
"Daga bindol man, toi oon wontirai ha ɗuɓi 1810 ?","The correct answer is **A: Wala arɗido gwamnati asluu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that in 1810, Chile ""wala les komoi"" which means they did not have any formal government. The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Lesdi Chile heɓi nasaraku dou lesdi Spain:** The passage states that Chile did not become fully independent until 1818.
*   **C: haa Napoleonic ɓe ɗonno haɓa:** While the Napoleonic Wars influenced events in South America, the passage doesn't explicitly say Chile was fighting during this time.
*   **D: Lesdi Chile heɓi njonde hoore mamɓe:** Chile did not become independent until 1818."
Noi himɓe yotta kauyeji ha nokkere Liguria dou ?,"Based on the provided text, the answer is **A: Ɓe mota ko koombooje**.

The text states: ""Pellel, firawol les be firawol mayo hauti qauyeji, be mota je wawata nasta der quaye mai daga yasi."" This translates to ""Places, roads down and roads of the sea connect the villages, with cars that can enter the village from outside."" While not directly stating that cars *and* boats are the *only* ways to arrive, it strongly suggests these are the primary modes of transport, especially highlighting that cars are able to enter.
"
Dume kalimaji italia dou nufata ‘Cinque Terre’ ?,"The correct answer is **C: Koseji joi**.

""Cinque Terre"" is Italian for ""Five Lands,"" meaning ""Five Villages."" In the context of the passage, ""Koseji joi"" translates to ""Five Villages.""
"
"Ban no bindol man wei, iri faɗe toi on hadi goddo faɗɗa ngam taa mosto wakkati jaangol diiyam?","Based on the text, the passage describes shoes that:

*   Have a rough texture to prevent slipping on wet or icy surfaces.
*   May have additional cleats (kusa) for better grip.
*   Can be treated with salt or calcium chloride for better traction.

The passage explicitly mentions that the shoes are designed to prevent slipping when wet. Therefore, the best answer is the one that describes shoes designed to avoid slipping.

Considering the options:

*   A: Faɗee be less sheuɗum (Shoes with less... ambiguous, doesn't directly relate to grip)
*   B: Faɗee be kujeji ha less man (Shoes with things on the bottom - relates to cleats for grip)
*   C: Faɗee be less tekkuɗum (Shoes with less weight - irrelevant to slipping)
*   D: Faɗee je wala mari 1/5 inci lestugo (Shoes without a 1/5 inch indent - doesn't relate to grip, and the passage specifies the lug size, not an indent).

**Therefore, the correct answer is B: Faɗee be kujeji ha less man (Shoes with things on the bottom)**. These ""things"" refer to the cleats/kusa that are added to the bottom to provide better traction and prevent slipping on icy or wet surfaces."
Toi on ndere do valititta ngam voingo no ɗum saalirta labi marɗi kankara wakkati jaangol?,"The passage describes materials used to make walking surfaces safer during cold weather, specifically mentioning:

*   Materials to provide better grip
*   Materials that prevent slipping on ice.

Considering these descriptions, the best answer is:

**C: Njaareendi**

Njaareendi (Gravel) is the most appropriate translation here, as gravel is spread on icy surfaces to increase traction and prevent slipping."
Toi on nder ko tokki ɗo buri nanndugo hakkunde Hawaii e Cook Island ?,"Based on the provided text:

*   **P says:** Cook Islands ""wala wuro"" (doesn't have a city)
*   **P compares:** Cook Islands to Hawaii, implying similarities.

The most accurate answer based on this is:

**D: Fuu kon mara birni (They both do not have a capital city)**

This is the only option that directly aligns with information found in paragraph P.
"
Toi on nanndai sama hakkunde Hawaii e Cook Island ?,"The correct answer is **B: Don achipelago on**.

Here's why:

*   **P states**: ""Kanjum lesdi je cakka ndiyam on ɗuɗɗum be guda sappo e jowey sankitigga"" which tells us that both Hawaii and Cook Islands are groups of islands (archipelagos).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Famɗi dou Hawaii**: P states ""Pat ɗe ɗum ɗo famɗi, ɗo numtina am dow dotti en ɗuɗɗum je waratano hawayi..."" meaning that Cook islands remind the author of the ancient people who came to Hawaii, but it doesn't mean they are similar
*   **C: Birniji ɗi Rarotonga opn e Aitutaki**: While Rarotonga and Aitutaki are mentioned as important islands in Cook Islands, this option doesn't say something that the two countries share, as Hawaii does not share the islands Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
*   **D: Island lesdi man mari wakkati go’o e Hawaii**: There is no indication in the provided text that Cook Islands and Hawaii share the same time zone."
Toi on nder ko tokki ɗo ɓeddata hebuko no ɗum hasirta karejii?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states explicitly that the Sirena ranger station is the *only* one that accepts credit cards for park permits and food. The other options, La Leona, San Pedrillo, and Los Patos, only offer park permits and do not offer food."
"Daga bindol man, ha toi a heɓata kati park ma to nani a ƴiɗa nafturgo cede se dai kati ATM?","The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Sirena kanjum tan on (ranger station) je hokkata babal walugo be nyamdu wulinga be beddari je babal walugo."" This translates to ""Sirena is the only (ranger station) that provides lodging and meals along with the permits.""
*   While Puerto Jimenez is mentioned as a place where you might get a permit, it specifies ""amma be wawata ɓe jaɓɓa kartalji ceede,"" meaning ""but they cannot accept credit cards.""
*   CafeNet El Sol is a place where you can pay a fee, but it's not directly a ranger station issuing permits in the same way Sirena is.
*   La Leona is specifically mentioned as *not* providing food or permits (""La Leona...do hokka tan babal walugo bow ala hokkugo nyamdu"" - ""La Leona... only provides permits but no food"").

Therefore, Sirena is the only option presented where you are able to obtain permits along with lodging and food. While not directly explicitly stated, this suggests that you would also be able to use cash at Sirena. Puerto Jimenez is a possible option, however, the passage specifies that they do not accept credit cards, leaving Sirena as the only viable option."
"Daga bindol man, kala Skiin toi ɓe waɗata ha labi steeper?","Based on the text, the answer is **C: Sitayel Alpine**.

Here's why:

*   The passage differentiates ""alpine style ski"" as ""fijirde koseje"" (playing on slopes/hills), which implies steeper terrain. The passage mentions that it's done primarily by utilizing ski lifts and is the earliest way that skiing was practiced.

The other options are not described as being primarily done on steeper slopes in the text.
"
"Daga bindol man, dume walliti mo ɓe wadata skiin yottugo?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: Boro ɓawo teddinga**.

The text mentions that in good conditions, you might find something that resembles backcountry skiing if it involves a long way of traveling – but only if it is different than being dropped off mid-mountain from a helicopter or carrying heavy equipment on groomed tracks. Thus, it is inferred that a heavy backpack is needed for skiin yottugo.
"
Dilloɓe dou nana bone wartugo jahaangal ngam dume ?,"Based on the passage, the best answer is **D: Fahmugo biiruki saare bo** (Understanding the customs of the new community/society).

Here's why:

* The passage emphasizes the importance of understanding the customs and traditions of a new place when traveling abroad: ""To a do warta lesde ma diga ledde yasi, hani a anda al’adaji kesum bo al’adaji sare be bo al’adamon be ɗabi’a mon je sare."" (When you return to your country from foreign lands, you must understand new customs and the customs of the community, and their nature of the community).
* It mentions that patience and understanding are crucial for successful travel and integration. The passage states understanding new things is a must have on the travel list.
* Options A and C are too general. While learning about new cultures and traveling to foreign countries are related, they don't directly address the reason why it can be difficult to return from travel.

Therefore, understanding societal customs and traditions is the closest and most relevant answer.
"
"Daga bindol man, tidal wartugo jahaangal wontiran daga kala bone toi wakkere dillobe man ?","The correct answer is **D: Dillobe kon mara munƴal (Travelers who have patience)**

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes the importance of patience and understanding when traveling to a new country: ""Himbe anda dow munyal be famtugo kanjum fu do nder ko wadobe jahangal mara."" This translates to ""People who know about patience and understanding are among those who make travel successful.""
*   The other options are not supported by the passage, while option D is directly supported by the text."
Nder dou fuu dume oon himɓe hana acca waɗugo ?,"Based on the provided text:

*   The passage describes the behavior of moose: they graze, but raise their heads when they sense danger. It mentions that people may observe them grazing in forests or on roadsides and should be cautious.

The question asks what people should NOT do in relation to the moose. Given the context:

*   The passage cautions people to be careful when observing moose. Therefore, option D, ""lartugo daga pelel dayiɗum"" (Looking/watching from a safe distance), would be something people *should* do. The other options do not have any relation to the text.

Therefore, the best answer is:

**D: Lartugo daga pelel dayiɗum**
"
"Daga bindol man,bayani toi oon na gonga ba dou Moose ?","The correct answer is **D: Ɓe karan hoore mabɓe toun laati**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Moose... nyaunata amma ɗo ata hore maɓɓe to ɓe nani wodi ko chuchata ɓe."" This translates to ""Moose... graze but raise their heads when they hear something suspicious.""
* **Answer D states:** ""Ɓe karan hoore mabɓe toun laati"" which translates to ""They raise their heads when they hear something."" This directly reflects the information in the passage.

The other options are incorrect because they are not explicitly stated or implied in the provided passage.
"
"Daga ko woni haa bindol man, dume oon saɗai hakkunde dillowo nder sahara ?","Based on the text provided, the biggest danger for travelers in the desert is likely:

*   **B: Larugu faayaalo bana ndiyam dou labeji** (Losing water because of the heat)

The text mentions:

*   People visit to see things unavailable elsewhere but suffer from the hot sun.
*   This can lead to getting lost, wasting time, and running out of water.
*   The desert is cold at night.
*   Body temperature can become dangerous without proper clothing.

Therefore, the emphasis is on the danger of heat and dehydration. While getting lost is a problem, the underlying cause for greater danger is the potential waste of water or loss of water in the hot climate."
Dume oon ɓe wolwan dou majum kon bone dillobe nanata ?,"The correct answer is **D: wulol-naage (heatstroke)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes the dangers of the hot sun and how it can lead to someone becoming ill due to the heat.
*   The passage also mentions the importance of water and the risk of dehydration, which are commonly associated with heatstroke.

The other options are less directly related:

*   A: Ndiyam sedɗa (dehydration) is a *cause* of heatstroke, not the condition itself.
*   B: Kawalwalniyaji is not mentioned in the passage.
*   C: Hypothermia is the opposite of heatstroke (dangerously low body temperature)."
"Daga bindol man, mooɓtal toi oon heɓe mastsala ɓawo warugo esfuloras ?","The correct answer is **C: Himɓe Tainos**

The passage states that the Spanish significantly reduced the Tainos population after their arrival.
"
"Daga bindol man, lafju toi oon himbe Caribes naftiri ?","The correct answer is **D: Ɗemgal Arawakan**.

The passage states that the Caribes ""volata yare himbe Arawakan"" which means they spoke the Arawakan language.
"
Moi ɓe lamminta ngam habdugo fijirde skiing wontira andadum?,"The correct answer is **A: Ski bums**.

The passage states ""Ɓe ɗon aandi ɗum be “ski bums” yimbe do taska yahdu maɓɓe be waɗugo ski ha baabal feere"" which translates to ""They are known as 'ski bums,' people who prioritize their lifestyle around skiing at various resorts"".  This indicates ""ski bums"" are the people associated with dedicating their lifestyle to skiing."
"Daga bindol man, hakkunde wakkati toi be fudɗi andurgo fijirde skiing ?","The correct answer is **B: 5000 BC**

The passage states: ""Numo je skiing nebi masin-- zaneji ha vurdol hosere holli alama himbe je watta skiing nebi daga dubi dubu jowi bako Christ."" This translates to ""Evidence of very old skiing--drawings on cave walls show signs of people skiing as far back as five thousand years before Christ.""
"
Ngole hautetebe islamd jaddum dun shede funa leddi Africa?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is:

**B: juna juldnmako**

The text states that Arabs brought Islam to the area, which is the foundation of Islamic practice.
"
Dume woni na inde famardum leddi east African islands? ,"Based on the provided passage, the correct answer is **A: kautal be faransa** (alliance with France).

The passage mentions: ""...koobo be woodi alaaqa be faransa..."" which translates to ""...which have relations with France..."". This suggests an alliance or association with France. The other options are not explicitly mentioned or implied in the provided text.
"
"iga habar, noye murna easter ha cociji gargajiya wa dete?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: tefol vigil ha jama'are asawe** (holding a vigil in church congregations).

The passage describes how tradition involves prayer services held on Saturday evenings and the middle of the night to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus. This aligns with the concept of a vigil.
"
to hadol hebki koyida ha hastugi Ecuador be leddi cuban fuddai hebgo dume?,"The correct answer is **C: Ticket rowunbul ngam tabbitinko njutirka darnet**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tiket njahagal yaha loora laata taabitiinaa fabbugoma."" This translates to ""A round-trip ticket is required to prove the duration of the stay.""

Let's break down why the other options are not the best answer based on the passage:

*   **A: Paspot wada lebbi 6 gada nyandere yadu (Passport valid for 6 months from the date of travel)** While passport validity is generally important for international travel, the passage specifically mentions the need for a round-trip ticket to confirm the intended duration of the stay for Cubans entering Ecuador.
*   **B: Dereyol gayya gerdinangol** The passage mentions the need to have a passport.
*   **D: Girinkat US** The passage speaks of the US green card
"
Dume mo yadu Ecuador to dun fuiita na?,"Based on the text, the correct answer is **D: Tabbitingo paspot** (Validating/Presenting a passport).

The passage states: ""Himbe cuba je mari carti us je haako haako yaha babal Ecuadoria be jeba derewol je na seto be wadi ba."" This translates to: ""Cuban people who want to travel to Ecuador must present a valid passport."" Therefore, presenting a passport is a requirement for Cubans traveling to Ecuador.
"
Ndume burata sadirma e lesde yasi do under sare?,"Based on the context, the correct answer is:

**A: Gite jarrabore** (Eyeglasses/Vision testing)

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a business focused on eyeglasses and vision care.** It mentions:
    * ""Darugal gitel wawan buro hoyugo"" (Making eyeglasses easier)
    * ""Nuuma maarugo gite"" (Improving eyesight/eye care)
    * ""Frames ha babal je mari matsala"" (Frames for people with problems)
* **The other options are less relevant:**
    * ""Firem kerol mauɗum"" (Large frame manufacturing) - While frames are mentioned, the focus isn't solely on mass production.
    * ""Inshora yigo"" (Health Insurance) - Insurance is mentioned as a challenge, not the core business.
    * ""Firem na bran-nem"" (Branded frame) - Branding is not highlighted.

The main goal of the business is to provide accessible and affordable eye care and eyeglasses in developing countries, which strongly supports the answer ""Gite jarrabore"".
"
Dume wartata hatsari ha soffi firem kerol maudum nder lesde yasi?,"Based on the context, the best answer is:

**A: beddari gite jarrabore tema tefetedum**

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses importing eyeglasses/frames to countries with limited access to such goods.**
* **The most relevant outcome is the possibility of improving eyesight by enabling access to eyeglasses.**

The other options are less directly related:

* **B: yaccaki kin tema tabbitaka dou firemje fere (research about other frames):**  While research might be related, it isn't the immediate outcome.
* **C: nde lattete nde nboda (it's going to be cheap/inexpensive):**  Cost is likely a factor, but not the primary outcome.
* **D: inshora mobbata hede den (insurance companies gather their money):**  Insurance is mentioned, but not as the central result.

Therefore, **A** is the most logical and relevant answer, highlighting the positive impact on vision correction.
"
Danarki naftirgo shede ha folkland halawol ngole woni non?,"The correct answer is **D: Band falkland pound, pound je British woni shede jabade**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the Falkland Pound (FKP) is pegged to the British Pound (GBP), meaning they have the same value. It also says that British currency is accepted in the islands, especially in Stanley.
*   Option A is incorrect because the text indicates that both Falkland pounds and British pounds are accepted, not just British pounds.
*   Option B is incorrect because the text implies that US dollars are accepted in some places, not just Stanley.
*   Option C is incorrect because the text suggests changing Falkland pounds back to another currency before leaving the islands, implying it *does* become harder to exchange outside."
"Iga habar, ndeye yadu falkland iga united state yobol shede ngole burata ngol kati?","The correct answer is **D: Fu nder Stanley**

The passage states: ""Ɓe wawan saanjugo ceede ha banki woni lesɗe mai ɗum wani Stanley ha cakka daga pellel siga FIC."" This translates to: ""They can exchange money at banks in the islands, mainly in Stanley, central to places like FIC.""  This indicates that Stanley is the primary place to exchange money.
"
Bikiwol ngole ha hautete gol be biki fellel du'a?,"Based on the text, the closest answer is **B: Biki fellel dua**.

Here's why:

*   The text mentions *""haykaliwol doo mari kilisa kala hittade fu fudirgo daga November timma chakka May""* this indicates that the church is visited from November to May.

*   The text also states *""duddum daga bangleji babal dua bedo hauta walima petel je babal dua wadi dubi ko gunki mabbe ko hunde fere je shafi babal man.""* This reinforces the idea that the church is visited for prayer purposes and the prayer area is well decorated.

*   The question *Bikiwol ngole ha hautete gol be biki fellel du'a?* asks if the events are related to prayers.

Therefore, the answer should be about prayer. **B: Biki fellel dua** is the only answer that is directly referring to ""prayer."""
Toidi nyiwaje boiitinade ngiite?,"The correct answer is **A: Kotoye iga kerol November ha shaka-May.**

The first sentence of the passage directly states that the festival (""haykaliwol doo mari kilisa"") happens from November to May (""daga November timma chakka May""). The question asks about when the festival takes place.
"
Iga habar lawol woni koingol ha siga shede dou lumaki ko aji aran eyafe?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Faddol dum ha kamfani**.

Here's why:

The passage mentions that even though flying first class is expensive, the airlines make money from it. The last sentence states, ""Jirgije andi wodi asali kungiya je firugo be wawata yoba hado dolllars je hebi ha hebugo fere lau lau be dar velugo, be chanji no hani""  This means even though the airlines have to pay more to offer first class services, the dollars they are able to acquire more than compensate for these expenses, making the first class cabin of the flight an important resource for the company.

The other options don't accurately reflect the main point:

*   **B: Nangol aji aran dou lube**  means taking first class on credit, and the article doesn't dwell on credit options.
*   **C: Nangol ajiwol arande ummago ma daret** This translates to ""taking first class is a direct way of making money"" which is incorrect because the passage is making the point that the resources they collect from offering first class more than cover the expenses.
*   **D: Tefol ustari**  This option is focused on the cutting down of expenses, which is not the central issue

Therefore, option **A** is the most logical choice."
"iga habar, dume woni bonnol wakkati ha ndarol nangol ajiji fare?","Based on the passage (which seems to be a mix of several languages), the correct answer is:

*   **C: Ustari**

The passage mentions that first-class tickets are expensive. ""Ustari"" translates to expenses in hausa."
Dume woni beddaatake to dun hauta dudirka hala fare ha Africa ba nder duniya?,"Based on the text, the passage discusses extra costs associated with traveling in Africa compared to other places in the world. These costs include visas, taxes, and travel to remote locations. Therefore, the best answer is:

**D: Shede yadu leddi ngam felle yasi Africa**

This translates to ""The cost of travel to countries for places outside Africa."" This aligns with the passage's focus on the additional expenses related to accessing destinations within Africa due to its unique challenges compared to other global regions.

"Iga habar, dume supamaket fuddata ngam hoɓal shubbal?","Based on the context provided, the best answer is **A: nyamdu defadum**.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses the trend of buying ready-to-eat food as a convenient option.** The first sentence explicitly mentions eating food directly as a quick way to eat. The later sentences describe places where prepared foods are available, emphasizing convenience.
* **""nyamdu defadum"" likely means ""prepared food"" or ""cooked food,""** which aligns with the theme of convenience and readily available meals discussed in the text.

The other options are less likely:

* **B: Bukkaru maikirowef (Microwave popcorn):** While convenient, the main focus of the passage is not on microwaveable foods in particular, but on the broader trend of prepared foods.
* **C: dou nyamorde (restaurants):** The passage discusses prepared foods from the store, and not necessarily restaurants.
* **D: koidum shede (discounting):** While price is mentioned, the main thrust of the passage is about convenience and availability of prepared foods, not solely about discounts.

Therefore, ""nyamdu defadum"" is the most relevant answer given the information provided.
"
koidum dume hebana shadowo ka fotta hakkilo mun ha supamaket?,"The question asks what someone should consider when shopping at a supermarket. Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: dou nyamorde (about food)** - This is too general. While related, it's not specific enough for decision-making in a supermarket.
*   **B: famdungo subo ferewal (reduced choice of ingredients)** - Considering the availability of ingredients is important when shopping, this is a good option.
*   **C: nƴamndu keccum (fresh food)** - Freshness is definitely a key factor to consider while shopping.
*   **D: ha bukkaru maikurowef (to a microwave box)** - This is not a reason to go shopping.

Between B and C, **C (nƴamndu keccum)** is the strongest. Considering freshness is paramount when choosing food in a supermarket.

Therefore, the answer is **C**."
Dume woni heptataki ha bolwobe faransa Belgians and swiss?,"The correct answer is **A: No faransa wadata nombarin**.

Here's why:

*   The passage focuses heavily on how Belgians and Swiss French speakers have a different system for writing numbers compared to those in France. The passage suggests that to be excellent French speakers, they would need to understand the numbering system used in France.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **B: kalimaji faransa kodi:** While vocabulary is mentioned, the core issue is how they handle numbers, not just vocabulary in general.
*   **C: Bolwoi kalimaji faransa:** The passage specifically mentions the number system as the main difference.
*   **D: Faransakoen Faransakore nbolwata:** This is too general and doesn't address the specific issue of the number system."
Ngole woni nanom e faransankore no dun wai ha Belgium be Switzerland?,"Based on the provided text, the most appropriate answer is **B: No dun wadata numbaji**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically mentions that the number system (tsari windi nombas) in Belgian and Swiss French differs from that of France. This is a key distinction highlighted in the text.
*   While the text touches on differences in vocabulary (a wiyata kalima man fu fere fere), the primary focus is on the numerical system.
*   The text is about learning French, not teaching.

Therefore, **B** is the most directly relevant and accurate answer to the question ""What is different in French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland?""
"
Lawol ngole woni hokkatake ha sabirabe yarbe boni?,"The correct answer is **D: Firango Delta**.

Here's why:

*   The original passage (P) mentions Delta Air Lines as one of the airlines that may offer compensation for being bumped from a flight.

The other options don't directly follow from the information provided in the original passage."
Ndume woni ngonga dou lobi sabirabe yarbe bone?,"Based on the information provided in statement P, the correct answer is:

**D: Dole be nanga diret be eyalin enta waya** (They must contact the airline company by phone)

Statement P explicitly states that to get a ticket, you must contact the airline company by phone and have them reissue your ticket.
"
Ndeye naftirgo GPS sitandalon dibayis burata naftirgo GPS nabigeson afilikason?,"The best answer based on the initial paragraph is **B: To a don tabbitini a heban labi data**.

Here's why:

* **The initial paragraph (P) emphasizes the downside of relying on GPS devices without data.** It says that without data, the GPS becomes useless.
* **Option B directly addresses this problem.** It states that using a standalone GPS device is better *if* you are sure you have a reliable data connection. This mitigates the primary problem highlighted in paragraph P.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: To a don yidi shiga shede (If you want to save money):** The original paragraph doesn't focus primarily on cost, but on the reliability and usefulness of the GPS device.
* **C: To a don wurta iga limgal (If you are out of range/signal):** This is more aligned with the problem, but option B better addresses the need for data that paragraph P highlights.
* **D: To ayiba jabol haya dibayis (If you like any device):** This is far too general and doesn't relate specifically to the issues raised by the paragraph.

**In summary, option B is the best answer because it directly addresses the dependency on data for GPS devices, which is the main concern raised in paragraph P.**
"
Dalilawol ngole woni woda dou naftirgo GPS afilikashin be dibayis sitandalon?,"Based on the passage, the most relevant reason why someone might not want to use GPS applications or standalone devices is:

*   **B: Doiingo shede (High cost)**

The passage mentions saving money to buy a GPS and the lack of benefits if there is no data or it doesn't work. Therefore, the main concern is the **cost** associated with purchasing, using, and maintaining GPS."
"Iga habar, noye tabbitinta adon ha jirgiwal ndiyam bngal?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: Nangol be egen baudo nder yadu Galapagos.**

Here's why:

The text suggests finding a tour operator (or ""laana manga je fottata be kujeji a yiɗi"") who:

*   **""tokki hedi mako ngam be sigina ma mo aandi hala Galapagos be aandal sosai ha do kombeewalji jur.""** This translates to finding someone with expert knowledge of the Galapagos Islands and their conservation.

Option C, ""Nangol be egen baudo nder yadu Galapagos"" (Getting with an expert in Galapagos travel), aligns directly with this requirement of expertise.

The other options are not as directly supported by the text:

*   **A: Nangol nder mopgal 8+ be radiji goo** (Getting in the top 8+ with good radio). There is no mention of radio, although it may have been implied.
*   **B: Nangol wakkati shim** (Getting Shim time). There is no mention of 'shim time'.
*   **D: Nangol ngam yeso** (Getting for yeso). There is no information or explanation of 'Nangol ngam yeso'."
"Iba habar, ngole nder limtadi na ngol naftire nder joiingo hobbe caca?","Based on the text, the answer is **A: Labirli duddi**.

Here's why:

The text describes casinos as places where people can spend a lot of time and potentially win or lose money. It mentions the excitement, the allure, and the potential rewards. It also implies the potential risks and the need for caution.  Therefore, ""lots of money"" is most likely to be associated with gambling.

The other options are not related to the risks associated with gambling."
"Iga habar, ndume dan cacajo mo dabare hadata hore mun?","The correct answer is **C: Ndarol agogo** (Clock).

Here's why:

*   **P:** The passage mentions ""Windoji be agogoji yawanci wala"" which translates to ""Windows and clocks are not usually present."" Casinos are described as places where time can easily be lost.

*   **Q:** The question asks, ""What is an item that can cause someone to lose track of time?""

A clock is an item that can help you keep track of time, so the lack of it in casinos contributes to the intended effect.
"
"Iga habar, halawon figo ngole maunini shaka kalimawol?","Based on the context of the paragraph, the answer is most likely **C: Holluki (Explanation)**.

Here's why:

* **P** describes something that identifies or highlights the parts that a writing sample can be divided into.
* **Q** asks for a good piece for a person to get knowledge on for writing a big research paper.
* **Holluki** is similar to an explanation of a part of the original written passage.

Therefore, **C** is the most appropriate answer.
"
"Iga hadar, dume mauningo inde wadata bonondaji?","Based on the passage (P), the best answer is:

**C: Bindi**

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses writing and its connection to understanding and expressing ideas. It emphasizes the process of translating thoughts into written form and the importance of critical thinking and observation.

The other options are less relevant:

*   **A: Jande (Reading)** - While reading is important, the passage focuses more on the act of writing.
*   **B: Hendol shakanta kude (Critical thinking about things)** - This is a component of the process, but not the central focus.
*   **D: Hendol shakanta hundeji (Critical thinking about objects)** - This is too narrow a focus.

Therefore, option C is the most aligned with the content in the passage."
"""Nder kauyeji Malaysia, memande ndene woni """"waro doo""""?""","The correct answer is **A: Walling kolel shimatel**.

The passage states that in Malaysia, the gesture of greeting someone is ""fattude kawyeku Male"". ""Fattude kawyeku Male"" translates to waving your hands.  This corresponds to option A, which describes a waving gesture. The other options don't relate to the described customs.
"
"""Iga hadar, memande ndene yaccata """"wartu""""?""","Based on the context provided, the passage describes greetings and gestures in different cultures. Specifically, it mentions raising one's hands to greet someone.

Therefore, the best answer is:

*   **C: Yebtol jude be ndarol yasi** (Raising hands and looking forward/ahead)"
"Iga hadar, ndume wadata feccol malloje?","Based on the text provided (P), the answer is **A: Gada malloje.**

The text states ""...amma do jippa daga hosere. do wadan sekugo, nokkude ulfitide nder mallimalloje, **je mabbata be gada mallimalloje man**.""

This translates roughly to: ""...but it descends from the hills.  It causes erosion, creating cavities inside the glaciers, **which collapse from the edge of the glaciers**.""

Therefore, the edges of the glaciers are what collapse.
"
"Iga hagar, ndume daga malloje sudata?","Based on the text provided (which seems to be in Fulfulde or a similar language), the answer is most likely **B: Logore mallore**.

Here's why:

* **The question (Q) asks ""What type of material comes from glaciers?"" or ""What comes out of glaciers?"" (depending on the exact nuances of the language).**
* **The passage (P) describes glaciers and mentions that they eventually melt, flowing down to the land and potentially carving out terrain as they recede.**
* **""Logore mallore"" (or something similar depending on dialect) is the most likely option to relate to the debris, eroded material, or meltwater that comes from glaciers.** The other options seem less related to glacial processes:
    * A: Feccol (Fragment) could be relevant but is very general.
    * C: Mahii (Material/Substance) also could be relevant but is very general.
    * D: Bulok je maude (Large block) While glaciers can move large blocks, it doesn't specifically answer the question.

**Therefore, ""Logore mallore"" is the best answer among the options, suggesting the most likely connection to what is released or comes from glaciers.**

**Important Note:** This is based on my best understanding given the limited context and my lack of fluency in the language. A speaker of Fulfulde or a related language would be able to confirm the answer with greater certainty.
"
"Iga hadar, ndillobe bedda ndakkilanki hiddeko kayi ebe umrona fu?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Bolkano Nyirangogo**.

The text mentions that ""Ha 2002 galluje fere ha Goma sankiti daga Nyiragogo hosere dirti iri galluje be labi..."", which translates to ""In 2002, part of Goma was destroyed by lava flowing from Mount Nyiragongo..."". Therefore, Mount Nyiragongo is the hazard being referred to.
"
Ngole woni wodatanta umtobe gite boɗɗum je himɓe ha Goma?,"The correct answer is **D: Iga nyiragongo volcano don nder gelle** (The Nyiragongo volcano is inside the city).

The passage states: ""Goma do Jodi jam, kala go vurti yasi goma saito dabbiti heba fama hakiika no habare man va’e ha sobbirre kivu. Wuro man fu do hunduko hooseere Nyiragongo"" which translates to: ""Goma sits safely, everyone who goes to Goma seeks to get the truth of what is happening in Kivu. The city is at the foot of Mount Nyiragongo.""

Therefore, option D is the only accurate answer based on the information provided in the text.
"
Ndeye leddi daga moyyanta fuddande nyande August warta ngodinde?,"Based on the passage, the answer is **A: January 1st**.

The text states: ""Gam, be acca himbe nasta bawo leddi fuddugo der may be heban dum daga yendere arande janeru."" This translates to ""So, they allow people to enter the backcountry for permits to be obtained from the first day of January.""
"
Dokawol ngole wada ngam rakkilango canyon?,"The correct answer is **B: Moyye don hebe tan nder January 1st** (The pass is only available from January 1st).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Gam, be acca himbe nasta bawo leddi fuddugo der may be heban dum daga yendere arande janeru."" This translates to: ""Therefore, they allow people to enter the inner canyon starting when they get it from the first day of January.""

The other options are incorrect based on the provided text."
Ngole nder limtadi ida habar hebaka nder jipporde biade nder habar?,"Based on the description in P, the most fitting answer is **A: Layiwol njaram bal**.

Here's why:

*   **P describes:** ""...Pellel suitare ɗo on marɓe cede be inde jippata to ɓe wari, alara weltare boɗɗum be Jemma."" This translates to ""A place of relaxation where those with money and names descend when they come, enjoying great relaxation and nightlife."" The mention of nightlife suggests the availability of drinks and entertainment.

*   Therefore, the feature that most accurately describes this element is a bar (""Layiwol njaram bal"" means ""a place for drinking alcohol"" in Fulfulde)."
"Iga halaji kebadi je habar, nder maji ngole hokki koto fotel mauningo?","Based on the provided text (which describes a luxurious and somewhat decadent environment with gambling, beautiful women, and rich people), the most likely answer is:

**D: Shede sudu de dama (Shede's house of luck/gambling/fortune)**

Here's why:

* **The passage heavily implies gambling:** ""Baabal wallugo feere ɗon mari asli daga wakkati duubiji lawol jirki lesdi be layi mayi"" (Gambling has a history dating back to the era of underground railroads and lines).  ""Pellel suitare ɗo on marɓe cede be inde jippata to ɓe wari"" (A place of luxury where those with money and names come).  ""Dillowo be (piles) be cede wawan be vi`a mo o tarta duniya mai be firawaul, mu wala cede bo sai dea juda ha babal fere ko sare"" (Gamblers with piles of money can be declared world travelers, or if they have no money they will be judged elsewhere).

The other options are less relevant to the passage:

* **A: Kuje kidde bo bode nder kayaji din fu (Hidden and beautiful things in all the rooms):** While luxury is mentioned, the focus isn't primarily on hidden objects.
* **B: Nyaburde be defowo baudo (Illness and a powerful healer):**  This isn't suggested by the passage.
* **C: Shudu ndokkoru shinadu (A quiet and clean place):** The passage implies a lively and potentially scandalous atmosphere, not quiet.
"
"Iga hadar, dume njahobe Greenland daccata?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is:

**C: Tammaki huwol e don, zamaka kautal intanet latto bonnidum** (Relying on it and assuming internet access is always good).

Here's why:

The passage talks about the availability of internet in Greenland, but also mentions the limitations:

*   While internet access is widespread, it relies on satellite technology and is expensive.
*   Even with widespread access, connections can be unreliable, especially when traveling to remote areas.

The text advises visitors to plan for cold weather and potentially challenging conditions, including internet access.
"
"Iga habar kebadum, lemtadi ngole woni mastalawol be tamanaki yadu ha Greenland?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: Sella (Health)**.

The passage discusses:

*   The importance of internet access in Greenland and how it is being provided.
*   The proper way to refer to the native people of Greenland, avoiding the term ""Eskimo""
*   The climate of Greenland, noting the extreme cold and the need to prepare for it. The passage specifically mentions health considerations related to the climate: ""Wakkati ceduwawan warta damuwa a haban nanugo boddum finbo do hokka jamo ha bandu."" (When the cold comes, worry and strive to dress well so it gives peace to the body.) Also, ""Amma ma wala hokka goɗɗo nyawu feere, bedo monna goɗɗo."" (But do not give another a different illness, let us avoid another)

While the passage briefly touches on ""laifu"" (life) in the context of daily routines and internet usage, it is not the primary focus. The passage highlights challenges presented by the cold and health precautions.

Therefore, **C: Sella (Health)** is the best answer."
Nder limtadi ngole joni naftirde be plaza shawata?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Jardin de la Union**.

The text describes Jardin de la Union as a place where people gather in the atrium, near the Templo de San Diego. It mentions people playing chess and the atmosphere during both day and night. The other options are also mentioned in the text, but the question specifically asks about a ""plaza shawata"" which Jardin de la Union clearly fits the description of a gathering place.
"
"Iga hadar, dume woni hebatake nder jardin de Union?","Based on the text provided, here's the breakdown and the correct answer:

*   **The text describes Jardin de la Union as a place where there's a gazebo with music playing:** ""Pellel mai lartti bana lumo chuggu manga, bo ko ndei wodi kujeji doggata, wala nange wala jemma. Wodi pellelji nyamande nyamdu ɗon tari lambu may, be naange ko kikkiɓe ɓurna fu ɓe ɗon fiya gimmi caahu ha rumfa wani cakka pellel majum."" (This translates to something like: ""It's a lively place, with things happening day and night. There are garden-facing places, and when the sun is at its hottest, they play music in the gazebo in the center."")

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **A: Shaka gazebo be gimi** (Gazebo with music)"
"Iga hadar, nder halaji biadi hala kane woni na non maggam?","Based on the provided text snippets, the answer is likely **D: Yande jable mbelanta dadirabe marbe bikkon**. Here's why:

* **P discusses hiking with children:** The passage mentions ""Sare je mari pikkon petel wawan mara haje beddari taskaram, amma yendere ha yaasi wawan fe’ugo be koidum be pikkon keccel ko je fuddi maunugo,"" which translates to ""Families with small children can have difficulty, but going outside can be fun with young children who are starting to grow up."" This implies advice/considerations for hiking with children.
* **Q asks about advice/considerations from passage P:** Therefore, the correct answer from the options provided would be one about making a hike pleasant for parents with children.
* **Option D reflects this sentiment:** ""Yande jable mbelanta dadirabe marbe bikkon"" suggests ""A pleasant day is good for parents with children"".  This fits the theme of making outdoor activities enjoyable for families.

The other options don't align as clearly:

*   **A: Shiriji sedda don ngida ngam hoitingo maggam:** ""A little bit of something is needed to take care of it,"" while relevant to a hike may not be very relevant to going on a hike with children.
*   **B: Woddirka ferotiri, amma ka wadeteka ha yande gotel:** ""Something is strange but it happens in one day"". This is too general and does not relate to children or advice.
*   **C: Jamaje marbe bandu shim buri nango beldum kujeden:** ""People who have bodies are better at catching sweet things,"" is not related to families and children or their enjoyment of hiking.

**Therefore, D is the most logical answer because it addresses the concerns of families and how to make their hiking trip more pleasant**"
"nder ko ɓe vindi man, ndeye woni nyande jable mari shiriji shim?","Based on the provided text (P), there is no information relating ""jable"" (which I understand as ""children"") to any specific condition or event that necessitates a visit to a hospital or requires medical assistance. The passage only talks about the practicality of hiking with young children.

Therefore, none of the answers (A, B, C, or D) can be correctly inferred from the passage. It's possible there's a misunderstanding of the text or the options. If there's additional context or a clearer translation, I can try again.
"
Ko fero tiri feundun nder Rogaland ko ander be nuttano Norway?,"The correct answer is **D: E be babbora be ladde sulninde**.

Here's why:

*   The passage says that in Rogaland and Agder, areas are called ""hei"" which means a treeless area covered with grass and heather. This is essentially describing a landscape where trees are missing or scattered, not forming a dense forest (""ladde sulninde""). Therefore, **D** best captures the character of the area.
* A is incorrect because the text says that there is a lack of trees, not a forest of trees.
* B is incorrect, fjords exist in Norway, especially in Rogaland.
* C is incorrect, there is no evidence that they are divided."
Iga hadar nder maji ngole won ni na hangol gol Norway?,"Based on the text in paragraph P, the correct answer is **D: Moorlands**.

The passage describes ""hei"" in Rogaland and Agder, which are moorlands covered in heather.  The passage also mentions the steep fjords but moorlands are more specific to the description of the land.
"
Ndeye njahobe ngidi yadu felle nyole?,"The correct answer is **A: Wakkati pewol**

Here's why:

* **The original text (P) discusses the ""wakkati pewol"" (time of harvest/season of harvest) and mentions the activities related to it (planting, harvesting).** This directly ties to the question about a time when people are looking to accomplish tasks, which would align with a harvest season.
* The other options don't fit the context:
    * **Wakkati tounde (time of difficulty/hardship):** While difficult times might prompt action, the passage doesn't specifically link that.
    * **Wakkati jangol India (time of studying in India):** This has no relation to the content of the passage.
    * **Wakkati ndiyamji (time of water/rainy season):** While the rainy season is crucial for agriculture, the passage more directly connects the activities to the *harvest* season.

Therefore, **A** is the most logical and contextually relevant answer.
"
"Iga hadar, ndeye mari ndare tedi ha dou nyenge?","The correct answer is **A: Wakkati malloji teddude** (Time of heavy rains).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes:** A time when there are many problems traveling by air due to heavy rainfall in India. It mentions flight delays and cancellations, and difficulties with visibility.
* **Wakkati malloji teddude** directly translates to ""time of heavy rains"" which aligns perfectly with the problems described in the passage.

The other options don't fit the context:

* **Wakkati jippan pewol (Time for launching birds):** This doesn't relate to air travel problems or heavy rain.
* **Wakkati jangol India (Time of Indian harvest):** While related to India, it doesn't address the rain and travel issues.
* **Nder leddi shuddi fu (In every cold country):** The passage specifies India, not every cold country.
"
Dume dakkata wadol to a yidi hebol yibbe wallinde?,"Based on the context of the first paragraph (P), which discusses networking, getting to know people at a marina, and showing what you can do, the best answer to the question (Q) ""What should you do if you want to get help?"" is:

**B: Maube yibbe sobaku**

This translates to something like ""Making friends/building relationships."" This aligns with the idea of networking and building connections to get help.

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Yaru dou be les woiinirde kolekolewal:** ""Go up and down the collection of books/papers."" This suggests researching, which might be helpful but not directly asking for help.
*   **C: Tallaki kudema:** ""Selling things."" This is about commerce, not seeking assistance.
*   **D: Widdaki be maggan kolekolewal mere:** ""Talking about/reviewing collection of empty/mere things"" This suggests aimless chatter, not a strategic approach to get help.

Therefore, **B** is the most logical answer in the context of the given passage."
Noye ngatta ha kuwobe ndiyam to nyami on walli nde?,"Based on the passage (P) and the question (Q), here's the breakdown and the likely correct answer:

* **Understanding the Passage (P):** The passage describes how to be successful or get opportunities at a marina.  The key elements are:
    * Get to know the marina and the people there.
    * Show what you can do (skills).
    * Be observant and helpful.
    * Network and talk to lots of people.
    * Build relationships and trust so people think of you when opportunities arise.

* **Understanding the Question (Q):** The question is ""How to succeed in a water job where they might help you."" It's asking how to get help or be successful in a job related to the marina (water work).

* **Analyzing the Answer Choices:**

    * **A: Kaute koe be fodobe kolekolewal (Engage with sailing colleagues)** - This is the MOST aligned with the passage. The passage emphasizes talking to people, showing your skills, and building relationships.  Working together will help.
    * **B: Ngode les radar (fly under the radar)** - The passage stresses networking and showing your value.  Staying unnoticed (under the radar) is the opposite of the advice given.
    * **C: Jamaje biabe tan lotata kolekolewal (Only rich people like to sail)** - This is not correct and is also illogical.
    * **D: Hadu be manggam mere (Don't be a big deal)** - This is not correct.

* **Conclusion:**

The best answer is **A: Kaute koe be fodobe kolekolewal (Engage with sailing colleagues)**. This directly reflects the passage's emphasis on networking and building relationships to get opportunities and help."
Fellere ndene woni nde tarihi leddi island iga tarihi?,"The correct answer is **B: Nbela kowloon mai**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""To a yiɗi a lara voɗugo Hong Kong, a acca island a hedira Kowloon waterfront je hidiri be mai."" This translates to ""If you want to see Hong Kong well, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront which is hidden with mai."" This means that the Kowloon waterfront offers a good view of Hong Kong Island, which directly answers the question of where to go to see the island."
Babal ganshi toi a viiata goɗɗo yaha je ɗo mari kujeji laruko baɗɗi?,"The correct answer is **A: Victoria Harbor**.

The passage states: ""No chieji je gidan sama je Hong Kong do jerindiri do nandi zane je layiji do je ndiyam **tasha jirgi ndiyam Victoria hollata**."" This clearly identifies Victoria Harbor as a landmark.
"
Ɗume kirke poccu wallitina ngam ustol nawnere koste nder ponnggorrɗe?,"Based on the text provided, the answer is **A: Les paɗe petel** (Pads that are well-made and wide at the bottom).

The passage explicitly states: ""Arande, lanyobe ni do wada pade je towi be les boddum je yajai."" This translates to ""First, saddlemakers should make pads that are well-made with a wide bottom."" These pads are designed to help reduce the impact and therefore the pain to the horse's hooves.
"
Je toi nder je lanyuki kombuwal valli lanyuwo wallina hakkilo to ɗo naftera be ko hullata?,"Based on the provided text, the answer is **D: Les paɗe mawnde**.

The text states: ""Arande, lanyobe ni do wada pade je towi be les boddum je yajai."" This translates to ""First, they make pads that connect well with a good and wide base."" Therefore, large base pads are relevant to the text.
"
Ɗume on hukkata waɗooɓe jahagal mangina canza lawol geuta?,"Based on the text, the correct answer is **D: Kautal hoore e dilloɓe feere ngam dillogo pellel go’o** (Meeting with other travelers to travel to the same place).

Here's why:

The passage describes how the website concept originated: Casey Fenton wanted a cheap flight, so he reached out to students at a local university, and many offered a free place to stay. This reflects the idea of connecting with other travelers to facilitate travel to a specific location. Options A, B, and C are not mentioned or implied in the text.
"
"No wardi ha bindi mai, je toi nder ɗo hauti be mangina canza geuta na gonga?","Based on the passage (P), the answer is **C: Waɗooɓe jahagal heɓan limgal baabal ɓe jippinta hoɓɓe je fesi ha nokkuure ɓe yata.**

Here's why:

*   The passage describes how Casey Fenton got the idea for Couchsurfing: He had a cheap plane ticket but no place to stay. He contacted students at a local university and received many offers of free accommodation. This demonstrates the core concept of Couchsurfing: people providing free accommodation to travelers. Option C captures this essential element.

Let's examine why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Waɗooɓe jahagal deni fu ɗo heɓa numu dau mo jippinta hoɓɓe:** While couchsurfing does involve a degree of trust, the primary motivation isn't *specifically* to gain trust. Also, there's no mention that everyone offering accommodation gains a certain level of trust.
*   **B: Networks ji feere teefan dilloɓe waɗa verification bo:** The passage doesn't emphasize any network and any verification.
*   **D: Lariti baabal je hoyi ha jippinta hoɓɓe wakkati go ɗo buuti ha ɓe watta jahagal:** It does not fit how the idea was created.

Therefore, **C** best reflects the information in the passage about the origin and fundamental principle of Couchsurfing."
"Daga bindo ɗarewo man, koɗo toi oon teemata njonde haa?","The correct answer is **C: Koɗo mow waɗata jahaangal ɓe ɓinkon**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Chi’eh je ɓe mahi je ɓikkoi joɗata hatotton a wawan a tawa beero en ha nder duuɓi 2o maɓɓe"" which translates to ""Those who travel with their children can be found to be young, in their 20s."" This indicates the traveler is with children.
"
"Hakkunde ɗarewol man, moi onn njoɗata haa hostel man?","The correct answer is **A: Banaɗo e bananaɗo dou waɗa jahaangal e ketchel**.

Here's why:

*   **P** The passage states that younger people (in their 20s) often stay in hostels, but older people don't.
*   **Q** We are looking for who might stay in hostels in the passage.
*   **A** This option introduces the term ""ketchel"", which is likely a hostel. While the translation is imperfect, this answer best reflects who might stay in hostels.
*   **B** This option states that the children, who are 22, are on a trip together, and do not stay in a hostel.
*   **C** People in their 70s are unlikely to stay in hostels according to the passage.
*   **D** This option states that the two families are on a trip with their children, and do not stay in a hostel.

Therefore, Option A is the only one who stayed in hostels."
"Daga bindol ɗarewol man, wolwe toi oon siifi fijirde boomerang boɗɗe?","The correct answer is **B: Himɓe wuro ɓuri andugo pellel man douw hobɓe**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""komoi wawi bo hobbe wuro yidi be wawa,"" which translates to ""anyone can learn it, but local people are more likely to succeed."" This means local people have an advantage.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A:** The passage does not promise you can catch the boomerang with your hand, only to make it come back.
*   **C:** The passage suggests the opposite. Boomerangs are mentioned as items sold in Australia.
*   **D:** The passage does not claim boomerangs return infrequently."
Je toi oon ɓurna ɓe naftirta haa nyamdu Javanese ?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is:

**C: Sukkar kwakwa** (Coconut sugar)

The text specifically mentions ""musamman javanese cocunut sugar"" as being heavily used in Javanese cuisine. The other options don't have specific backing in the provided text.
"
"Nder ko wani haa vindi man, noi on ɓe heɓata nyawu wanshowu?","The correct answer is **B: Pathogen jii**

Here's why:

*   The passage explains that contagious diseases are caused by things like viruses, bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms. These are all examples of **pathogens**. Pathogens are agents that can cause disease.
* The question asks how does someone get an infectious disease, and the answer is pathogens.
* The other options are not the direct cause:

*   Himɓe yaube (old people) - While old people can be more vulnerable, age itself doesn't cause infection.
*   Bacterium jii (bacteria) - Bacteria are a type of pathogen, but ""pathogens"" is a broader and more accurate answer.
*   Tufannde vaccine (type of vaccine) - Vaccines are used to prevent infection, not cause it."
"Nder ko wani haa vindi man, ɗime on ɓe andi do ɓedda nyawu wanshowu?","The correct answer is **B: Bairos**.

The passage mentions ""virusji"" which translates to ""viruses."" The question asks about what thing is known to cause widespread illness. Viruses are a well-known cause of widespread illnesses.
"
Ha habaru toi ha suptowo web walo dau je hoore VPN waddowo he’ata naftirooɓe?,"Based on the provided text, the answer is **D: Kugal naftirowo man mari haaje yofitirko gam bandwidth je mari sembe.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that web proxies generally provide ""manga bandwidth be dama dama boddum je huwugo,"" meaning ""limited bandwidth and a less good experience.""
* Therefore, someone who *needs* significant bandwidth would be better off using a VPN instead of a web proxy.
* The other options are less related to the reasons why VPNs are used over web proxies.
"
"Nder ko woni vindi mai, toi on nder halaji ɗo dow VPNs be web proxies naa ɗum googa?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is:

**C: Web proxies ɗo mari less semmbe to hati be VPNs** (Web proxies are generally less secure than VPNs)

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Be do hakkili na be yanan gizo habe (http)."" This indicates that web proxies are generally less secure and use HTTP.
*   The passage also mentions ""Yawanci bedohokka manga bandwidth be dama dama boddum je huwugo,"" meaning that web proxies typically offer less bandwidth and a worse user experience. This implies that they are less performant than VPNs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: VPNs ɗo tammi hokkugo bandwidth marɗum sembe ɓuri web proxies** (VPNs are expected to offer more bandwidth than web proxies) - This is correct based on the passage, but C is a more encompassing answer about their relative strengths.

*   **B: Web proxies wawata eɓɓutugo web trafic ko toi** (Web proxies are able to intercept web traffic) - While technically possible, the passage doesn't explicitly focus on web proxies intercepting traffic.

*   **D: Wadan VPNs haute be http** (VPNs only work with HTTP) - This is incorrect. VPNs create a secure tunnel for *all* internet traffic, not just HTTP."
Ɗume wallata godɗo naftira lenguru matotire kamfani haa yaasi dab ɓawo babal mai?,"Based on the provided passage, the answer is **B: Lammba matotiriaduniyaru fuu**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""ɓurna pat, a sodan lamba duniyaru kanjum tan je acchata waya PSTN yona ma."" This directly translates to ""most of all, buying a global number is what cuts the PSTN line from you."" This indicates that a global number allows you to bypass traditional phone lines.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Noddol intanet:** While the passage mentions using the internet for calls, it doesn't specifically state that internet calls alone are what allows someone to use a business phone system outside of their physical location. It is a part of the solution, but not the primary reason according to the text.
*   **C: Setilait:** The passage mentions satellite internet access, but it's presented as an option for connecting to the internet in remote areas. It's not directly tied to using a business phone system outside of a traditional office.
*   **D: Lenguruji PSTN:** The passage actually says that global numbers allow you to *bypass* the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network).
"
"Hakkunde darewol man, dume oon kon hani ngam nastugo noddol ha lenguru m?","The correct answer is **A: Sodu lammba kon naftirai ha duniyaru fuu**.

The passage explicitly states that you can ""sodan lamba duniyaru kanjum tan je acchata waya PSTN yona ma"" (buy a global number that allows you to bypass the PSTN network). This directly supports option A. The other options are either contradicted by the passage or not the primary solution presented.
"
Je toui on nder ko tokki ɗo cifai lafju wolde himɓ wonɓe lesdi Italiya?,"Based on the information in passage P, the most accurate answer is **A: Lafju r ɗiɗi ferotiri be r go’o (The pronunciation of a double 'r' is different from a single 'r')**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: *""A tabbitina a wi r wurta fere be to a wiyan rr. To a wi karo a ɗo nufa diye amma bo to a wi karro kenan a ɗo nufa kuje bana amalanke.""* This translates to: *""Make sure that the pronunciation of a single 'r' is different from a double 'rr'. If you say *karo*, you mean car, but if you say *karro*, you mean something like a cart.""*

The other options are either not as directly supported or are less precise:

*   **B: Lafja Kalimaji ɗuɗɗun woni no be vindi dum (Many words are spelled the same)** - While the passage mentions spelling similarities, it focuses specifically on the pronunciation difference of 'r' and 'rr'.
*   **C: Kalimaji kon mari jorre c be g saɗi fahmugo (Words containing 'c' and 'g' are difficult to understand)** - The passage mentions 'c' and 'g', but only in the context of their variable pronunciation depending on what letters follow them. It doesn't claim they are inherently difficult to understand.
*   **D: Lafjaru kalimaji serran kestol ɓaleri vindi man (The pronunciation of words is affected by their spelling)** - This is generally true for all languages, but the text focuses directly on the `r` pronunciation.

Therefore, the most accurate and directly supported answer is **A**."
Je toui oon na cifa Izmir kon be fuɗɗi deko zamanu ɗou ?,"Based on the passage, all of the options (A, B, C, and D) are mentioned as aspects that describe Izmir's modern development. However, the question asks which one signifies the **beginning** of the modern development.

While all options are part of the modern landscape of Izmir, ""boulevards maundi"" (wide boulevards) often signify a planned urban development initiative that marks the beginning of modernization in many cities. The passage states ""Boulevards maundi, Maadi glass-fronted be pellel sodugo kujeji je zamani ɗo mari traditional boɗejum-tiled roofs, 18th century lumo, be julurde be churches kiɗɗe, pat be wuro mai ɗo mari atmosphere je bana Mediterranean Europe do traditional Turkey.""

Therefore, the best answer is:

**A: boulevard ji yaajuɗi** (wide boulevards)
"
Je toui on nder ko tokki ɗoo cifa aladaji himɓe Izmir?,"Based on the provided text, the answer is **C: A heɓan kanti zamanu be rewtirde naane fuu**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states: ""jotta warti wuro zamanu jotta, ɓe mahi kujeji kesum ɗuɗɗumb o jotta wodi lumo kesum, a heɓan hayaniya himɓe sosai...be julurde be churches kiɗɗe"" This suggests a blend of modern and traditional elements.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Wuro man ɗou tartiri e lonyooɗi:** While Izmir has a rich history, the text focuses more on its current blend of old and new rather than explicitly stating it's historically turbulent.
*   **B: Yanayiije holitiri lesdi Turkey naane:** The text describes a city that integrates new and old so it doesn't only holitiri lesdi Turkey naane
*   **D: Kanjum oon wakkere mayo mawnde ha lesdi Turkey:** The text says Izmir is the second-largest metro area, not necessarily the largest port area.

Therefore, option C best encapsulates the description of Izmir as a city where you can find both modern and traditional aspects."
"Kalima Hanami ɗou nufa, larugo ɗume?","Based on the passage, here's the breakdown to determine the correct answer:

*   The passage states ""Lawol wadugo kuje man wari daga China ha **plum blossoms** on pindi be yidi."" This translates to ""The tradition came from China where **plum blossoms** were admired.""
*   While the passage mentions Cherry blossoms in the context of the definition of Hanami, it mentions plum blossoms are the admired flower.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: Plum blossoms**"
Moi on hauti pati gam laruki cherry blossoms je fuɗɗano?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is:

**C: Japan's emperor**

The passage states: ""Ha Japan, lamdo on wadi ni hanko be himbe mako je ha koutu imperial moftorde nanugo beldum je wakkati pindi fuddi fudugo je fuddorde."" This translates to ""In Japan, the emperor made it himself with his people in the imperial court listening to the beauty of the season when the blossoms began to begin.""
"
"Nder ko ɓe vindi man, toi on nder kujeji ko shafi Jerusalem haadi foɗa hakkilo himɓe ngam yaha ganshi fellel man?","The best answer is **D: Pelle taarihaaji**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage focuses on Jerusalem's historical and religious significance as a draw for visitors.** It mentions:

    *   Its location in Judea and ancient history
    *   Its importance to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

*   While the other options are true, they don't capture the primary reason *why* people are drawn to Jerusalem as a tourist destination: its historical sites.

Therefore, option D best addresses what makes Jerusalem an attraction."
Fannu toi on kon wolwan ha nder ɗarewol man je be andiri Jerusalem be majuum ?,"The correct answer is **C: Andal dow diina** (Knowledge of religion).

The passage focuses heavily on Jerusalem's importance to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, highlighting its religious significance, holy sites, and the role of faith in the city's identity. This aligns directly with ""Andal dow diina"" (Knowledge of religion).
"
"Hakkunɗe ɗarewol man, kala mo sompo’wo toi on heɓata dama soɗugo kati Wild ?","The correct answer is **D: Mo ciryanda warugo Nashonal park Kruger e park fere bo (Someone who wants to visit Kruger National Park and other parks as well).**

The passage states that purchasing a Wild Card allows the holder to visit various parks in South Africa and even other southern African countries. This aligns with option D.
"
Hakkunde toui oon daidaitaii e sifa National Park lesdi South Africa?,"Based on the provided text, the most accurate answer is:

**D: Hoɓɓe wawan nastugo toh ɓe soɗi kati Wild**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Wonan be khairu goɗɗo heɓa o soda kati wayild, gam hokkan marɗo ɗum supta jarendi fijerde..."" (Without a doubt, someone must buy a Wild card, so that the owner of it can choose to visit any playground in Africa or all playgrounds in Africa). This clearly indicates that purchasing a Wild Card allows entry to the park.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Kanjum oon baabal woɗinga ha lesdi South Africa (It is the largest park in South Africa)**: While the passage mentions the size of Kruger National Park (KNP), it doesn't explicitly state that it's the largest in South Africa.
*   **B: Gedam dabbaji ɗuɗɗi waɗan sanja gam ecozone goɗɗum (Different animals were divided for good ecological zones)**: The passage mentions different ecozones and diverse wildlife but doesn't state that the animals were deliberately placed in different zones.
*   **C: Kanjum oon wonni National park peetel ha lesdi South Africa (It is the closest National Park in South Africa)**: The text does not say anything that means it is the ""closest"" National Park."
Toi oon nder ko tokki ɗo wonta saɗan wa’ai jesɗe yaɓɓare ka’eji man?,"The correct answer is **A: Hedi sofnaɗum**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Himbe wawan saldira fofugo bobe be hakkilina, musanman mah wakkati be sofi,wawan warta mastyala."" This translates to ""People can experience a slippery fall, especially when it is wet, it can become slippery."" This clearly indicates that wet conditions (hedi sofnaɗum) are a major factor in making the stone steps slippery and dangerous."
Toi on nder halaji do waɗai bayani asalin hosere Machu Picchu kiɗɗum haa nder ko ɓe vindi man?,"Let's analyze the passage and the answer choices.

The passage describes Huayna Picchu (which is often referred to as ""Hado hedi sera woyla je Machu Picchu don hosere juɗɗum""). It mentions:

*   It's a high peak north of Machu Picchu.
*   It's steeper than the main site.
*   Most people can climb it in 45 minutes.
*   It has stone steps and steel cables in steeper sections.
*   Conditions can be slippery, especially when wet.
*   There's a cave near the top you have to crawl through.

Now let's look at the options:

*   **A: ko climbers jami waɗan rella fofle maɓɓe (climbers often perform rituals at its peak)** - The passage doesn't mention rituals.

*   **B: Wala labi-jude nder babal steeper man fuuu (There are no steel cables in the steeper sections)** - This contradicts the passage which says ""der steeper sections steel cables ɗo hokka vallende handrail"".

*   **C: Dole a salatoru nder loogooji ha dow tou (You have to crawl in the caves at the top)** - This aligns with the passage which says ""Wodi cave petel ha kombi dau mai je dole a sala hedi mai, ɗo les bo ɗo hiɓɓi (There's a cave near the top you have to crawl through, low and hidden.)"".

*   **D: Babal steeper man warti hedi kulni ɗum (The steeper part becomes scary)** - While it implies it, this isn't stated explicitly in the passage.

Therefore, the best answer is **C**.
"
"Nder ko ɓe vindi man, toi on na ainahin staple jee Majorcan cuisine?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Buroodi** (Bread).

The passage specifically mentions ""Buroodi be neebam Olive"" (Bread with Olive oil) as a key ingredient in the ""PA amb Oli"" dish, which is described as a well-known evening meal in Majorca. The passage also mentions other ingredients like tomatoes and various toppings that go with the bread and olive oil. While meat (Kusel) is mentioned as a possible topping, bread is the base and central component of the described dish.
"
"Tokkugo habaru ko wani ha der vindi man, haala toi on dow nyamduji hangi naa ɗum gonga?","The correct answer is **D: Ɓe ɗon heɓa hangi jiyotamal ha Rotorua**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Babal duddum ha Rotorua do hokka geothermal hangi..."" which translates to ""A large area in Rotorua provides geothermal Hangi..."" meaning they obtain geothermal Hangi in Rotorua.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hangi jiyotamal ɗou naftira ka’e wulinga ngam wulwina ngaska man:** While the passage does mention using heated stones, it does not explicitly say that Hangi *itself* uses the stones to heat the earth oven. It says that the stones are used to heat the earth oven where they cook.
*   **B: Hangi kon neftirta e ka’a wulinga ƙeɓan ha Wellington:** The passage says that geothermal energy is used in Wellington, but not necessarily *from* heated stones.
*   **C: Ɓe don defa nyamdu kon settina be Hangi:** This is too general. While Hangi is a cooking method, the question asks for something specifically and factually mentioned in the passage."
toi on nder do wala haa ko ɓe vii nder ko waɗata ma a waƴa hangi pit?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka’e kon wulna ma**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states ""Ko gaska man do wuli be ka’e wulinga daga hite,"" which translates to ""The earth is heated by the rocks being heated by fire."" This directly describes the process of the stones being heated to create the hangi pit. While ""Gas"" or geothermal might be used indirectly, the immediate source of heat *within the pit* is from the heated stones.
"
Gasnaaɗum toi on ɓuri weelugo a heɓa daga hedi maluumjo rewitirde?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: Wu’ina gudel daga rewitirde**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that religious figures (""baabe diina"") give the women visitors headscarves (""taskaram guude""). This indicates that headscarves are associated with the location described."
Ɓorne toi nder ko wani ha babal ɗo on wonata haa rewitirde ngam wuƴa? ,"Based on the passage, the answer is **D: Gudel (Guude)**.

The passage mentions that religious leaders give ""rewɓe je waray be taskaram guude"" - women who come with taskaram guude.  ""Guude"" refers to the shawls or cloths given to women. The phrase ""taskaram guude"" gives more context around who's receiving the cloths.

Therefore, the best answer to the question ""What do you wear in order to stay covered up enough to sneak through?"" is **D: Gudel (Guude).**
"
Ndei waɗowo jahagal marata damaji masin je larugo koode to yilli Antarctic areas?,"Based on the passage, the best answer is **A: Wakkati dungu** (Winter time).

The passage explicitly states that the Arctic and Antarctic experience darkness during winter, with the sun not rising. This darkness makes it a good time to study climate changes because there is less interference from sunlight.
"
Dei waya je kode ɓe adamajo warata latta njude waya salula?,"The question is asking what the purpose of the technology described in paragraph P is. Let's break down paragraph P:

*   **Wireless technology:** It uses satellites.
*   **Buoy-based:** It has a ""float"" that sits on the water and is connected to something underwater.
*   **Remote use:**  It allows for operation ""from afar.""
*   **Information service:** It provides lots of information.

Considering these points, the most likely answer is **C: Toh naftiran gal yaasi (To use remotely)**. The passage describes a wireless, buoy-based system designed for remote operation and data gathering.
"
Dei kode ɓe adamajo lattata je ɓurata yiɗugo daw waya zamanu?,"Based on the first paragraph (P), which discusses methods of communicating wirelessly even in remote locations using satellite technology and various ways to access that connection, the question (Q) is asking about what makes these kinds of wireless communication technologies attractive in the modern world.

The correct answer is:

*   **C: To bayaniiji rumot na dole** (When locations are remote and necessary). This directly relates to the core idea of the first paragraph, which emphasizes the usefulness of these technologies in places where traditional wired connections are unavailable.

Here's why the other options are not as good:

*   A:  Sa’e siutaare ha birniiwol (Taking a stroll in a city) - not related to remote areas or wireless necessity.
*   B: Wakkati jahagal be kobuwal (Time to travel with difficulty) - irrelevant to the question.
*   D: To a lattan ko he’ata waya jamanu hosata footoo (If you become someone who gets in the way of time, take a picture) - completely unrelated and nonsensical."
Lural daw je toi ardata ha waddugo ko salititta jamhuriyaaji?,"Based on the provided text, the most relevant answer is:

**B: Sendurki yaareji (Language difference)**

Here's why:

*   The text mentions that in Chisinau, people speak Romanian but also use Russian.
*   The region of Transnistria has its own government and currency, and their political aspirations led to clashes with Moldova after independence.

While religion (D: Diina) is also mentioned as a major belief in Moldova, language difference appears to be a more direct factor contributing to the separatist movement and political instability described in the text. Options A and C are irrelevant to the passage."
